North Korean Cyberattacks: A
Dangerous and Evolving Threat
Bruce Klingner

N

North Korean missiles and nuclear weapons have garnered fear, international condemnation, and tough sanctions. Pyongyang’s cyber activities,
however, have elicited less reaction and punishment despite having been
used repeatedly in attacks against governments, financial institutions,
and industries.
The attitude of experts toward North Korea’s cyber capabilities
was initially dismissive, just as their reaction to the regime’s nuclear
and missile programs had been.1 Many, pointing to the famous nighttime satellite imagery of northeast Asia with a dark North Korea
surrounded by the blazing lights of its neighbors, did not believe that
the technologically backward regime was capable of sophisticated
cyberattacks.
Nevertheless, although the regime fails to provide technological comforts
for its populace, Pyongyang developed an advanced cyber warfare prowess that is surpassed by few nations. From initial rudimentary distributed

﻿

orth Korea has conducted cyber guerrilla warfare to steal classified military secrets, absconded with billions of dollars in money
and cybercurrency, held computer systems hostage, and inflicted
extensive damage on computer networks. Defending against Pyongyang’s
cyberattacks requires the same constant vigilance and rapidly evolving methods and techniques that law enforcement agencies had to use in response to its
evasion of sanctions. The United States has taken only limited actions against
North Korean hackers and foreign countries that allow them to operate and
launder money from cybercrimes. Without a firm response from the U.S., the
North Korean regime will continue to undermine the effectiveness of international sanctions and could inflict even greater damage during a crisis or
military conflict.

denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against South Korea, the regime improved
its cyber programs to create a robust and global array of disruptive military,
financial, and espionage capabilities.
As its cyber proficiencies evolved, Pyongyang implemented ever more
sophisticated techniques and prioritized financial targets to evade international sanctions and augment the regime’s coffers for its nuclear and missile
programs. Although it appears to have de-emphasized cyber operations
against military and infrastructure targets in recent years, the regime previously alluded to attacking allied info-centric warfare strategies and civilian
networks during a crisis.
The scope of North Korea’s demonstrated cyber capabilities and the
severity of other recent cyberattacks, such as the Russian-sponsored SolarWinds hack, Chinese exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities,
and DarkSide malware shutting down of the Colonial Pipeline, demonstrate
the continued critical vulnerability of the government, financial, infrastructure, and corporate sectors. The United States, in conjunction with foreign
governments and the private sector, needs to augment cyber defenses and
respond more forcefully to attacks. Failure to do so enables North Korea
to continue undermining the effectiveness of international sanctions and
leaves the United States and its partners exposed to a potentially devastating cyberattack in the future.

Cyber: A Key Component of North Korean Strategy
Pyongyang has developed a comprehensive and sophisticated arsenal
of cyberattack tools and methods. In 2017, senior U.S. intelligence officials
assessed that North Korea was one of the top four cyber threats capable
of launching “disruptive or destructive cyberattacks” against the United
States.2 The Director of Central Intelligence warned in January 2019 that
North Korea “poses a significant cyber threat to financial institutions,
remains a cyber-espionage threat, and retains the ability to conduct disruptive cyber attacks.”3
North Korea’s cyber weapons and tactics are consistent with the regime’s
asymmetric military strategy. As North Korea’s conventional military forces
deteriorated in comparison with those of the United States and South Korea,
Pyongyang developed new weapons to counter the growing gap in capabilities, including nuclear weapons, missiles, and long-range artillery.
After studying U.S. military operations in Iraq, North Korean leader Kim
Jong-il concluded that allied high-tech warfare was vulnerable to cyberattacks and that “in the 21st century, war will be [fought as] information

Cybercrime: New Methods for Old Strategy
North Korea’s cyber operations are consistent not only with its asymmetric military strategy, but also with the regime’s long history of using criminal
activities to acquire money. Earlier criminal efforts included counterfeiting
of currencies, pharmaceutical drugs, and cigarettes; production and trafficking of illicit drugs, including opium and methamphetamines; trafficking
in endangered species products; and insurance fraud.

warfare.”4 Kim opined that “cyber attacks are like atomic bombs” and that
“[w]ar is won and lost by who has greater access to the adversary’s military
technical information in peacetime.”5
North Korean strategists see cyberspace as an integral part of its military
strategy, designating it “the fifth major battlefield” along with ground, air,
sea, and space.6 By 2009, Kim declared that North Korea was “fully ready
for any form of high-tech war.”7 The South Korean Ministry of Defense
warned that North Korea was able to disrupt Global Position System (GPS)
networks and was developing the means to jam high-tech missiles and precision-guided bombs.8
Kim Jong-il initiated North Korea’s foray into cyber warfare, but
it was during Kim Jong-un’s reign that Pyongyang accelerated and
expanded its cyberattacks on a broader spectrum of targets. Since 2010,
North Korea is believed to have jammed the GPS systems of planes
over Incheon Airport; stopped the release of a major motion picture
in the United States; hacked into South Korean banks, newspapers,
and nuclear power plants; and defrauded banks and cybercurrency
exchanges to gain billions of dollars.
“With intensive information and communication technology, and
the brave Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) with its [cyber] warriors,” Kim declared in 2013, “we can penetrate any sanctions for the
construction of a strong and prosperous nation.”9 It is noteworthy that
even then, Kim highlighted the financial sanctions–evading aspect of
cyber operations.
Kim Jong-un declared that cyber warfare is a “magic weapon”10 and an
“all-purpose sword that guarantees the North Korean People’s Armed Forces
ruthless striking capability, along with nuclear weapons and missiles.”11 In
the run-up to a crisis or as an alternative to kinetic strikes, the regime could
conduct cyberattacks on government and civilian computer networks that
control communications, finances, and infrastructure such as power plants
and electrical grids.

NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:
A DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT

Cybercrimes enable the North Korean regime to gain currency and
evade international sanctions in ways that are more efficient, cost-effective, and lucrative than past illicit activities and more recent smuggling
and ship-to-ship transfers of oil. The regime’s cybercrimes are global in
scope, provide astronomical returns on investment, and are low-risk since
they are difficult to detect and attribute with little likelihood of international retribution. There have been very few United Nations (U.N.) or
U.S. sanctions imposed or legal actions taken against North Korean cyber
groups. Cybercrime is especially beneficial to the regime as it faces the
cumulative effects of international sanctions and the impact of self-imposed COVID restrictions on legal and illicit foreign trade, as well as
natural disasters in the agricultural heartland and decades of devastating
socialist economic policies.
Cybercrime Eclipsing Traditional Crimes. As the international
community cracked down on North Korea’s various criminal endeavors,
the beleaguered regime shifted toward new ways to gain money. Cyber
operations are now a greater component of North Korean criminal activities than earlier, more traditional “bricks and mortar” endeavors such as
counterfeiting and smuggling. North Korea’s hackers “have become the
world’s leading bank robbers,” in the words of John Demers, head of the
National Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. “Simply put,
the regime has become a criminal syndicate with a flag, which harnesses its
state resources to steal hundreds of millions of dollars.”12
As with any criminal activity, it is difficult to assess how much North
Korea has gained from its cybercrime operations. Governments, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies may be unaware of some
cybercrimes or unable to determine the perpetrator conclusively. Even
with a successful cybercrime, North Korean hackers may not have been
able to convert all of the cryptocurrency into hard cash, and some victimized financial institutions were able to recover some or all of their
lost currency.
In August 2019, the U.N. Panel of Experts estimated that North Korea
had cumulatively gained $2 billion from cybercrime.13 For comparison, in
2019, North Korea legally imported $2.7 billion in assorted civilian merchandise, mostly from China,14 and its annual gross domestic product (GDP)
was $29 billion.15
A South Korean organization has estimated that North Korean cybercrimes generate an annual revenue of $860 million,16 but others assess that
Pyongyang may gain $1 billion a year—a third of the value of the nation’s
exports—from cyber heists.17 During 2017–2018, North Korea was estimated

SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247
heritage.org

September 2, 2021 | 5

to account for 65 percent of all global cybercrime.18 One regime hacking
unit, the Lazarus Group, is assessed to have gained more than $1.75 billion
worth of cryptocurrency.19
In September 2018, a grand jury issued an indictment of North Korean
cyber operative Park Jin-hyok for attempted cyber heists and extortions
in Asia, Africa, North America, and South America totaling $1.3 billion
during 2015–2018.20 In 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice declared that
North Korean hacking of virtual currency exchanges and related money
laundering “poses a grave threat to the security and integrity of the global
financial system.”21

Pyongyang has an expansive array of government organizations and
affiliated hacker groups conducting malicious cyber operations.22 Organizations appear to have specified missions, although there also appear to
be overlap or changes in mission over time. The shadowy nature of covert
cyber groups, as well as fragmentary and conflicting information, makes a
definitive understanding difficult.
The predominant government organizations for cyber operations are the
Reconnaissance General Bureau and the General Staff Department. Both
are subordinate to the State Affairs Commission,23 which is chaired by Kim
Jong-un, and have numerous subordinate units. Other government units
include the State Security Department and the Defense Commission.
In additional to government agencies, numerous affiliated North Korean
hacker groups are conducting attacks against government, financial, infrastructure, and other sectors. These groups include:

North Korea’s Illicit Cyber Operations

cyber protection rackets whereby North Korean cyber groups will
refrain from attacking entities in return for payment;
Retaliate against opponents of the regime or those who demean North
Korean leaders; and
Illegally acquire and launder stolen money to evade sanctions and

financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, and the SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) network.25

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

﻿

North Korean hackers are adept at developing sophisticated cyber coding
to gain access even to well-protected government, military, and financial
computer networks. They are also astute at exploiting human vulnerabilities through social engineering methods to trick victims into uploading
malware that compromises network security.
Hackers seek access in much the same way that intelligence agencies
recruit human assets. Like intelligence agencies, they ascertain the information and organizations that would achieve government-directed objectives,
conduct reconnaissance to identify individuals that could provide access to
that information, assess vulnerabilities and the means by which to exploit
them, and determine which methods they can use to exfiltrate the data.
North Korea often delivers malware through spear-phishing emails targeted at people who can provide either direct or tertiary access to a target
network. While many of these attempts are variants on “please click on
the (infected) attachment,” the means employed to allay the target’s suspicions have become increasingly clever. The hackers use “spoofing” tactics
to disguise an email, social media account, or website so that it appears
to be from a recognized reliable source so that the target will unwittingly
upload malware. The approaches are often individually customized and
highly profiled, using personal information either about the target or about
individuals or organizations that the target would trust.
In Operations Dream Job, In(ter)ception, North Star, and WannaJob,
North Korea targeted Australian, Indian, Israeli, Russian, South Korean,
and U.S., defense and aerospace experts to gain classified or proprietary
information by using fake job offers from defense contractors as lures to
install data-gathering implants on the victims’ systems. The cyber groups
impersonated job recruiters by creating fictitious WhatsApp, Facebook, and
LinkedIn profiles of legitimate companies and even conducted extensive
dialogue through email and phone calls.
Similar techniques were used against employees of banks, companies,
and other organizations to gain access to computer networks.26 North
Korean groups will mimic colleagues, friends, journalists, or Korea-related
organizations to gain access to a victim’s computer and then use acquired
information or contact lists to conduct follow-on approaches.27 The groups
have even commissioned experts to write papers that were then used as bait
when targeting other experts.28
Hackers and intelligence agencies also welcome targets that offer themselves as sources. A “walk-in” intelligence source walks into an embassy or

A DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT

﻿

otherwise contacts a government source to volunteer his or her services
without having been previously targeted. Hackers conduct “watering hole”
attacks by either infecting or creating websites that potential sources are
likely to visit.
The hackers can create infected documents or links and wait for someone
to arrive and unknowingly take the bait. In 2017, North Korean hackers
infected the website of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority with
malware that was programmed to download to computers that visited the
site only if they were from 104 preselected financial institutions and telecommunications companies.29
Once a source has provided access, the available information, including
information on possible access to other potential targets, is investigated
and vetted for its usefulness. North Korean hackers may spend nine to
18 months conducting reconnaissance, elevating user privileges, and
disabling security procedures before attempting to execute a cybertheft.
North Korean hackers are seen as unique in their willingness to destroy
large amounts of data to cover their tracks or distract targets while a theft
is in process.30

North Korea’s Evolving Cyber Operations
Pyongyang’s cyberattacks developed through several phases.31 Initially,
the regime focused on cyber espionage to steal information and cyberattacks to disrupt or destabilize networks related to national defense, nuclear
power plants, infrastructure, telecommunications, media, and corporations.
Early cyber operations were a form of “reconnaissance by fire” to test preliminary capabilities against opponents’ defenses and may have served as
proof of concept for far more extensive and crippling operations to be used
in a time of military conflict or major crisis.
As North Korea improved the scope, scale, and sophistication of its
cyber operations, it progressed through phases of cyberterrorism, revenge
attacks, and extortion; cyber bank robbery; cryptocurrency exchanges and
decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms; and (after the onset of COVID)
pharmaceutical companies. The initiation of a new phase did not curtail
cyberattacks prevalent in previous phases, although their scope and prioritization might have changed. For example, cyberespionage operations
continued after Pyongyang initiated cybercriminal activities to generate revenue.
In 2015, North Korea began cyber robbery operations to gain revenue for
the beleaguered, heavily sanctioned regime. Pyongyang began with attacks

against traditional financial institutions such as banks, fraudulent forced
interbank transfers, and automated teller machine (ATM) thefts. After the
international community took notice of these attacks, the regime shifted
to targeting cryptocurrency exchanges. By 2020, according to one U.N.
member state, North Korean “attacks against virtual currency exchange
houses [had] produced more illicit proceeds than attacks against financial
institutions” with stronger cyber protections.32

Potential North Korean Cyber Actions During a Crisis

﻿

North Korea has proven to be adept at deeply penetrating even highly
secure computer networks of governments, militaries, banks and international financial transaction systems, and critical infrastructure targets. More
worrisome, however, is the possibility that Pyongyang could inflict even greater
damage during a crisis or hostilities on the Korean Peninsula. These attacks
indicate that Pyongyang has the potential to engage in cyber warfare with
disproportionately massive impact—in other words, to create a cyber 9/11.
North Korea could paralyze critical infrastructure systems such as communications, dams, electrical grids, hospitals, nuclear power plants, supply
chains, and traffic-control systems. North Korean hackers have targeted
railroad companies and airlines, including an automated operating system
that controls trains’ speed. Hackers have already jammed airline GPS signals and might seek to gain control of airplane controls.33
In 2013, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) revealed that
Pyongyang had developed a Trojan program to take over computer networks
and power supply systems, chemical materials facilities, oil storage terminals, water treatment stations, and subway networks throughout South
Korea. The NIS indicated that the regime had recorded the geographic
coordinates of South Korean chemical materials facilities, oil storage terminals, water treatment stations, and power plants and that it had collected
information on power substations, subway networks and elevated roadways
in major cities, tunnels, bridges, and railroad stations.34
In 2017, North Korea attempted to use spear-phishing emails to gain
entry into U.S. electric companies as an early-stage reconnaissance operation. Computer security firm FireEye reported that the hackers failed to
gain access at that time to computer systems or industrial control systems
that regulate the supply of power.35 Nevertheless, the U.S. government
has warned that North Korea’s illicit cyber activities “threaten the United
States and the broader international community and, in particular, pose a
significant threat to the integrity and stability of the international financial

10

A DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT

system,” in addition to which “[t]he DPRK has the capability to conduct disruptive or destructive cyber activities affecting U.S. critical infrastructure.”36
Pyongyang could engage in economic warfare to steal massive amounts
of money or undermine the stability of the international financial system
or worldwide markets. The regime could conduct ransomware attacks on
banks to gain money or to disable or destroy computer networks as well as
flood the SWIFT system with fraudulent transactions. In 2019, more than
11,000 SWIFT member institutions worldwide sent approximately 33.6
million transactions per day through the network.37

﻿

What the United States Should Do
North Korean cyber operations are a strategic threat to the United States,
its partners, and the international financial network. Pyongyang’s cybercrimes provide a means to evade sanctions and undermine international
efforts to curtail the regime’s prohibited nuclear and missile programs.
Washington needs to make addressing this threat a national priority by
establishing a comprehensive whole-of-government strategy, to be coordinated with other governments as well as the private sector. The U.S. should
fully enforce existing laws and assess whether additional legislative and
executive actions are needed, including enhanced regulations of cybercurrency exchanges and DeFis. Washington should determine a range of
punitive steps, both cyber and kinetic, for responding to attacks deemed
detrimental to national security.
Specifically, Washington should:
l

Assess the threat. The Director of National Intelligence should
prepare classified and unclassified National Intelligence Estimates
defining the extent of North Korean cyber capabilities, past attacks,
and the potentially greater threat from future operations, including
during a crisis or hostilities on the Korean Peninsula. These reports
should be submitted to appropriate committees in Congress.
The U.S. should also continue to issue threat advisories that provide
detailed technical details of North Korean cyber organizations, recent
cyberattacks, ways to evade cyber defenses, and money laundering
in order to alert government and private-sector entities to take
appropriate actions to improve cyber defenses. Widespread public
dissemination of threat information and private contacts with other
governments as well as banks, financial institutions, and companies

SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247
heritage.org

September 2, 2021 | 11

enable the sharing of more detailed information while still protecting
classified sources and methods.
l

Create a comprehensive national strategy to combat cyber
threats. Addressing North Korea’s cyber threat should be a national
priority that requires a comprehensive whole-of-government
response that uses all of the instruments of national power. Given the
expansive nature of Pyongyang’s cyber operations, the effort should
be directed by the White House and should include, at a minimum, the
Departments of Treasury, Justice, Defense, Commerce, and Homeland
Security as well as the Intelligence Community.

However, questions remain with respect to how the National Cyber
Director will interact with other senior officials and organizations
with direct or indirect cyber responsibilities. Who will have the clout
to direct a coherent, comprehensive policy across vast bureaucratic
organizations with overlapping responsibilities and conflicting priorities? Without real authority over departments and agencies, the new
cyber director could face some of the same problems that plagued the
Director of National Intelligence, whose position was created after the
9/11 attack. If bureaucratic turf battles and inertia are to be overcome,
the President will have to make clear who has real authority on cyber
policy, particularly as it interacts with national security, economic,
and law enforcement policies.

﻿

It is encouraging that the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act
created the position of National Cyber Director to serve as principal
adviser to the President on cyber policy. Chris Inglis, a 28-year veteran
of the National Security Agency, was confirmed in June 2021 to lead
coordination of U.S. cybersecurity policy and strategy implementation; oversee efforts to increase cybersecurity and deter malicious
cyber activity; coordinate the federal response to cyberattacks; engage
with the private sector; engage in diplomatic efforts to develop norms
of and international consensus on responsible state cyber behavior;
and support “the integration of defensive cyber plans and capabilities
with offensive cyber plans.”38 Also encouraging was President Biden’s
announcement that he would “make cybersecurity a top priority at
every level of government…further strengthen partnerships with the
private sector, and expand our investment in the infrastructure and
people we need to defend against malicious cyberattacks.”39

12

NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:
A DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT

l

Coordinate with the private sector. Extensive sharing of cyberthreat information among and between the public and private sectors
is critical for improving defenses against North Korean and other
hackers. Collaboration and coordination enable a more comprehensive assessment of weaknesses in government, industry, business,
financial, and infrastructure computer networks as well as proposals
for innovative technical or methodological fixes. In conjunction with
industry, businesses, and financial institutions, Washington should
therefore develop, coordinate, and promulgate cyber rules, regulations,
security protocols, and best practices to improve cybersecurity and
the resilience of networks.

﻿

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act40 authorized the Department of Homeland Security to “encourage robust sharing of useful
cybersecurity information among all types of entities—private,
Federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal.”41 The new Office of the
National Cyber Director will join existing government bodies in
engaging with the private sector, and this will increase the potential
for competition, confusion, and industry frustration.42 Care should be
taken to delineate responsibilities among government agencies.
Despite all actions that governments, industries, and banks implement,
the weak link will still be the individual employee who inadvertently
allows malware to penetrate the system. No matter how strong the castle’s defenses are, one person carelessly allowing the drawbridge to drop
down undermines all defenses. With that in mind, organizations should
explore technical measures that preclude or reduce the downloading
of malware. Preventing North Korean cyber intrusions will require
both improved technical defenses and effective measures to thwart the
regime’s sophisticated social engineering techniques that induce individuals to upload malware unknowingly into computer systems.
l

Engage international partners. U.S. defenses are only as strong as
the weakest link overseas. The U.S. should continue and expand efforts
to coordinate with foreign governments, law enforcement agencies,
and financial regulatory agencies at the national level and, through
them, regional and domestic partners. There should also be engagement with foreign financial institutions and businesses to disseminate
information on North Korean cyber hacking and money-laundering
tactics, techniques, and procedures.

SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247

The United States should take the lead in multiple fora to establish and
ensure compliance with international cybersecurity standards. Such
efforts could take place in existing diplomatic entities, such as the
United Nations or G20 forum, led by the White House or State Department, as well as with financial and law enforcement organizations.
1. The U.N. Panel of Experts recommended that financial institutions,

including banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, enhance cyber
defenses by sharing threat information and best practices through
organizations such as the Financial Services Information Sharing
and Analysis Center.43 The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC) could take the lead on encouraging and
facilitating information sharing among law enforcement and financial institutions. The initiative could be modeled on the Treasury
Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN
Exchange program to enhance the sharing of information on priority illicit finance threats with financial institutions.44

with existing regulations or risk losing their access to the SWIFT
financial transaction network or ability to maintain correspondent
accounts in the U.S. financial system.

3. Given the United States’ extensive intelligence collection capabil-

ities and law enforcement expertise, Washington should dispatch
teams overseas to engage with foreign government, law enforcement, financial institutions, and private-sector entities to provide
targeted information on North Korean cyber programs. The U.S.
did this extensively to counter North Korean evasion of sanctions.
Those efforts successfully alerted entities that were unaware of
North Korean activities and triggered compliance prior to the
issuing of formal U.S. punitive measures.

l

Fully enforce laws against illicit activities and cyber operations. Despite the severity of Pyongyang’s cyberattacks, the U.S.
government has taken action only against a handful of North Korean
actors. Unfortunately, this is consistent with actions by successive
U.S. Administrations to limit law enforcement efforts against North
Korean, Chinese, and other entities that violate U.S. laws and U.N.
resolutions. The U.S. government should take action against North

﻿

2. Washington should ensure that financial entities either fully comply

14

A DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT

Korean hackers as well as countries that enable them to operate from
their soil or that provide technology, equipment, or training.45 This
can be done by:
1. Fully resourcing the sanctions enforcement effort by dedicating

sufficient investigative and enforcement effort to it;

2. Fully enforcing FinCEN regulations that are applicable to crypto-

currency transactions by U.S. nationals or within the United States;

3. Prohibiting transactions by U.S. nationals or within the U.S. that

involve cryptocurrencies the anonymity of which has facilitated
illicit transactions on behalf of North Korea;

4. Amending the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act

﻿

of 201646 to ban transactions in proceeds derived from cryptocurrency that constitute the proceeds of illicit activity or were involved
in carrying out illicit activity; and

5. Putting greater pressure on host nations to expel or extradite North

Korean hackers, including terminating the U.S. Department of
Commerce technology export licenses of nations that fail to do so.47

Stronger action could constrain North Korea’s ability to gain funding
for its prohibited nuclear and missile programs. The Departments
of Treasury and Justice should target banks, financial institutions,
and front companies that are used to launder money stolen by
North Korea. In 2017, the U.S. Congress passed to the Trump White
House a list of 12 Chinese banks that were believed to be committing
money-laundering crimes in the U.S. financial system. To date, the
executive branch has taken no action. In the past, the U.S. imposed $8
billion–$9 billion in fines on European banks that laundered money
for Iran, but it has yet to impose any fines on Chinese banks that
launder money for North Korea.
Justice Department actions against some North Koreans revealed the
extent to which they had moved money illicitly through nine different
Chinese banks. The Treasury Department should engage with those
banks to discern whether they unwittingly facilitated financial crimes,
in which case they should be subject to remedial actions, or were

heritage.org

complicit, in which case they should be fined, labelled money-laundering concerns, and denied access to the U.S. financial system.48 The
Bank Secrecy Act, Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act, and other U.S.
regulations require U.S. financial institutions to take anti–money
laundering measures to ensure that correspondent bank accounts of
foreign entities are not used for money-laundering purposes in U.S.
financial institutions.49
In January 2021, Congress enacted the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2021,50 which includes the Anti-Money Laundering
Act of 2020. The statute updates U.S. anti-money laundering laws,
significantly expands the U.S. government’s authority to subpoena
documents held by foreign banks overseas, and codifies a $50,000 daily
fine for failing to comply with subpoenas. The act also preserves the
government’s ability to terminate foreign correspondent accounts
in the U.S. financial system, which is a financial “death penalty” for
foreign banks that do not comply.51
Augment regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges. As banks
and financial institutions responded to North Korean cyberattacks,
Pyongyang shifted toward cryptocurrency exchanges and DeFis both
as targets and as means to launder money. The U.S., in conjunction
with other nations, should review existing legislation and regulations
that are applicable to cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure sufficient
security against cyberattacks and prevent money-laundering.
The U.N. Panel of Experts recommended that member states should
implement Financial Action Task Force standards and “that to
manage and mitigate the risks emerging from virtual assets,” such
assets should be subject to enhanced monitoring and compliance
standards.52 The United States could augment its technical warning
notices to include increased emphasis on identifying North Korean
attacks, specific actors and their virtual coin “wallets,” and techniques
used against cryptocurrency exchanges.
l

Determine U.S. responses to North Korean cyberattacks. The
potential for greater and even catastrophic North Korean cyberattacks
against the United States, its partners, and the international financial
system raises questions about the proper levels of retaliatory or even
preemptive actions against the regime. “[A] good defense isn’t enough,”

﻿

President Biden has commented; “we need to disrupt and deter our
adversaries from undertaking significant cyberattacks in the first
place. We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial
costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in
coordination with our allies and partners.”53
Given North Korea’s limited exposure to cyberattacks, a U.S. or
international response would also need to consider non-cyber tools
of national power. These include “diplomatic action, cooperation
reduction, visa restriction, financial sanctions, legal action, and
military action. A consistent pattern of imposing meaningful costs
for malicious cyber behavior will strengthen our cyber deterrence
if applied consistently, and in some cases, publicly.”54 A military
response to a non-military cyberattack would be a difficult decision,
particularly given the difficulty of conclusively assigning blame for
cyber operations. In 2014, however, NATO leaders agreed that a largescale cyberattack on a member country would be considered an attack
on the entire alliance, potentially leading to the invocation of Article
5 and triggering a military response.55 Similarly, the United States
and Japan agreed in 2019 that in certain circumstances, a cyberattack
could constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article V of the
U.S.–Japan Security Treaty.56
The United States should consider discussing with other U.N. member
nations whether future North Korean cyberattacks should merit a
U.N. Security Council resolution and accompanying sanctions, such as
those imposed in response to the regime’s nuclear and missile tests.57
North Korean cyber groups that commit cybercrimes to evade sanctions and gain funding for the regime’s prohibited nuclear and missile
programs could be sanctioned under existing resolutions.

Conclusion
North Korea is a direct threat to the security of the United States, its
allies, and the international financial system. Pyongyang continues to augment and refine its nuclear, missile, and cyber threats to the United States
and its allies. While its kinetic military attacks have been limited in recent
years, the regime has freely engaged in an expansive cyber gray-zone war
with much lower risk of retaliation than conventional military actions entail.
Pyongyang has conducted cyber guerrilla warfare to steal classified military

secrets, has absconded with billions of dollars in money and cybercurrency,
has held computer systems hostage, and has inflicted extensive damage on
computer networks.
Defending against North Korean cyberattacks requires constant vigilance and rapidly evolving methods and techniques of the sort that law
enforcement agencies had to use in response to Pyongyang’s improved
tactics for evading sanctions. Complacency or a lack of vigor will leave
critical government, military, financial, and industry sectors vulnerable to
potentially devastating attacks.
Yet the United States has taken only limited actions against North Korean
hackers and foreign countries that allow them to operate and launder money
from cybercrimes. Without a firm response from the U.S. to North Korea’s
hack of Sony and subsequent threat of terrorism, such attacks against the
U.S. and its interests will only grow more common.

Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Formed in 2009 during
a restructuring of military and intelligence organizations, the RGB
is the primary agency responsible for intelligence, clandestine, and
terrorist operations. It includes the majority of North Korea’s cyber
units with an estimated 6,800 “trained cyber-warfare specialists.”58
Subordinate units include:
1. Unit 35 (also known as the Central Party Investigative Group),

which is responsible for developing malware, identifying opponents’
vulnerabilities, and conducting technical education and training.59

﻿

2. Unit 91, which is responsible for acquiring information and

technology on nuclear development and long-range missiles. It
has conducted cyberattacks against the South Korean Ministry of
Defense and critical national infrastructure targets such as Korea
Hydro and Nuclear Power, which operates nuclear and hydroelectric power plants.60

3. Unit 121 (also known as the Cyber Warfare Guidance Unit), which

is North Korea’s largest cyber unit and has both intelligence-gathering and attack components.61 It is responsible for infiltrating
computer networks, hacking secret information, and planting
viruses to paralyze enemy networks.62 It is also responsible for
attacking infrastructure networks in the transportation, telecommunications, gas, electric and nuclear power, and aviation
sectors63 and may be responsible for Korea Peoples’ Army jamming
operations64 and the disabling of South Korean command, control,
and communications structures during an armed conflict. Unit 121
oversees Unit 91; Lab 110, which manages Offices 35, 98, and 414;
Unit 180; 128 Liaison Office; and 413 Liaison Office.65

Lazarus is the largest and most prevalent of North Korea’s hacker
groups. It was created in 2007 and is subordinate to Lab 110 of Bureau
121 of the RGB. It has targeted the aerospace, chemical, electronic,
entertainment, financial, government, health care, infrastructure,
manufacturing, media, military, publishing, and shipping sectors. It
also has targeted North Korean human rights organizations in South
Korea and Japan.73 Lazarus was responsible for many of North Korea’s
most audacious cyberattacks, including attacks against South Korean
banks in 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, and the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017.
Kimsuky was created in 2012 with a global intelligence-gathering
mission. The organization has extensively targeted U.S., South Korean,
and Japanese individuals, think tanks, government agencies, and other
organizations focused on Korean security issues, nuclear policy, and
sanctions. Kimsuky seeks access to computers to gain information
through social engineering tactics such as phishing, credential and
password harvesting, and watering hole attacks.74
Reaper (APT38) targets financial institutions and interbank financial systems to obtain money for the regime. Since 2015, APT38 has
been linked to attempts to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from
financial institutions, including the Vietnam TP Bank (2015); Bangladesh Bank (2016); Far Eastern International Bank (2017); Bancomext
(2018); and Banco de Chile (2018).75
Andariel has conducted cyber espionage and cybercrimes against
foreign businesses, defense industries, financial institutions, and government agencies since 2015. It has been linked to hacks into ATMs to
withdraw cash and steal customer information that it later sells on the
black market. Andariel also has developed malware to hack into online
poker and gambling sites.76
Bluenoroff conducts cyber heists to generate revenue and enable
the regime to evade sanctions. The group was first noticed in 2014 as
part of Pyongyang’s new emphasis on financial targets. Bluenoroff
has attempted to steal over $1.1 billion from financial institutions and
cryptocurrency exchanges in Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Pakistan,

Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Chile, and Vietnam.77 In
conjunction with the Lazarus group, Bluenoroff stole $81 million from
the Central Bank of Bangladesh’s New York Federal Reserve account
using stolen SWIFT credentials. An attempt by the two groups to steal
an additional $851 million was thwarted by an alert bank officer who
noticed a typographical error.

Phase Five: Alternative Currencies and DeFis

Phase Six: Pharmaceutical Companies
North Korea took advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to target pharmaceutical companies for proprietary information on vaccine production as
well as individuals and businesses seeking COVID relief funding.
In 2020, the Lazarus group planned a large-scale phishing campaign
against more than 5 million individuals and businesses in India, Japan,
Singapore, South Korea, the U.K., and the United States. The hackers would
pose as local authorities dispersing government COVID support funds and
direct the targets to fake websites where they would divulge personal and
financial information.175

﻿

After successfully hacking into a financial target, operatives must eventually convert cryptocurrency into real currency and launder it to avoid
detection. Cybersecurity experts have identified North Korean hackers
moving money through hundreds or thousands of separate transactions
in numerous countries to launder it before cashing out.
In 2019, North Korea began to use decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms
and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX) to launder cryptocurrency. The Lazarus group’s use of DeFi platforms nearly doubled in 2020
as its use of mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges decreased.173 The
shift reflects North Korea’s money-laundering adaptability in response
to increasing security protocols or law enforcement focus on existing
platforms. CipherTrace, a crypto intelligence company, assessed that
cryptocurrency thefts and hacks declined in 2020 due to increased security
procedures but that hacks against DeFis increased.174

including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca, Genexine, Shin
Poong, and Celltrion. It was unclear whether North Korea was attempting
to create its own vaccine or to sell obtained vaccine information to a foreign
pharmaceutical company.176 In some cases, the hackers sent spear-phishing
emails representing themselves as job recruiters or World Health Organization representatives.177
The Lazarus group also targeted government agencies conducting
COVID research, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services and the European Medicines Agency. The Kaspersky computer
security company assessed that some computers at government agencies
and companies had been breached.178
In 2021, a member of the South Korean National Assembly asserted that
intelligence reporting indicated that North Korea had targeted Pfizer to
gain COVID vaccine information. It was uncertain whether the attack was
successful.179

Appendix 3: U.S. Government Responses
to the North Korean Cyber Threat
In recent years, the U.S. government has issued numerous warning
notices to highlight the growing danger of North Korean cyberattacks.180
The notices provide detailed technical information to enable companies
and financial institutions to develop defensive responses. Washington also
has issued indictments and imposed sanctions on North Korean individuals
and entities in response to illicit cyber activities. Specifically:
l

In 2016, the United States designated North Korea as a money-laundering concern, precluding it from accessing the U.S. financial system
for international financial transactions.181
In September 2018, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of Justice sanctioned and
unsealed criminal charges against Park Jin-hyok and the Chosun Expo
Joint Venture for their involvement in the Sony hack, Bangladesh bank
robbery, and WannaCry ransomware attack.182
In June 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
affirmed the U.S. government’s authority under the Patriot Act to
subpoena records from foreign banks with correspondent accounts
in the United States as well as to cut off access by foreign banks to the
U.S. financial system or dollar-denominated transactions.183 The ruling
was in response to a Chinese company’s use of three Chinese banks to
launder millions of dollars on behalf of North Korea’s sanctioned Foreign Trade Bank. The court ruling “caused a ripple effect throughout
the Chinese financial sector. Stock prices for the three banks…plummeted shortly after the publication of the circuit court’s opinion.”184
In September 2019, OFAC announced sanctions against the Lazarus,
Andariel, and Bluenoroff hacking groups for cyberattacks to support
North Korea’s illicit nuclear and missile programs. The legal action
blocks any property or interests of these entities in the United States. Any
transactions by U.S. persons or foreign financial institutions using correspondent accounts in the United States would be subject to sanctions.185

In 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the
Reconnaissance Guidance Bureau after the Sony hack.

In February 2020, the Pentagon, the FBI, and the Department of
Homeland Security issued a series of messages warning of a North
Korean cyber-espionage hacking campaign to “conduct illegal activity,
steal funds & evade sanctions.”186
In March 2020, a grand jury indicted and the Treasury Department
imposed sanctions on two Chinese nationals (Tian Yinyin and Li
Jiadong) for laundering more than $100 million in cryptocurrency
stolen by North Korean agents in a 2018 hack of a cyberexchange
that netted $250 million. The individuals were also linked to a North
Korean cybertheft of $48.5 million from a South Korean currency
exchange in 2019.187
In May 2020, the Justice Department charged 28 North Korean and
five Chinese individuals with laundering more than $2.5 billion in
illegal payments for Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. The unsealed indictment accused the individuals of acting as
agents of North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank, the regime’s primary
foreign currency bank and under U.S. sanctions for facilitating nuclear
proliferation.188 The case was the largest U.S. sanctions violations case
against North Korea and reveals the extent to which the United States
believes China has assisted North Korea’s illicit network to evade
international sanctions.189
In August 2020, the U.S. government warned of a North Korean group
targeting government defense contractors to gather intelligence
surrounding key military and energy technologies. The group used
fake job postings from leading defense contractors as lures to install a
data-gathering implant on the victim's system.190
In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil complaint
for forfeiture of 280 cryptocurrency accounts linked to North Korean
hacking of two cryptocurrency exchanges in July 2019 and September
2019 that netted millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency for the
regime. “The complaint follows related criminal and civil actions
announced in March 2020 pertaining to the theft of $250 million
in cryptocurrency through other exchange hacks by North Korean
actors” and “exposes the ongoing connections between North Korea’s
cyber-hacking program and a Chinese cryptocurrency money laundering network.”191

In August 2020, the U.S. government issued a warning about the
compromise of ATMs by the North Korean–linked BeagleBoyz and
Operation FastCash. In February 2020, North Korea had resumed its
targeting of banks in multiple countries for fraudulent international
money transfers and ATM cashouts, ending “a lull in bank targeting
since late 2019.” BeagleBoyz overlaps with other North Korean cyber
groups and has been involved in attempts to steal nearly $2 billion at
least since 2015.192
In September 2020, leaked U.S. government documents revealed that
North Korea laundered $174.8 million in illicit funds from 2008 to
2017 through prominent U.S. banks in New York, including JP Morgan
Chase and Bank of New York Mellon. The documents also showed that
Chinese companies were involved.193
In October 2020, the U.S. government issued a warning alert on North
Korean cyber group Kimsuky. The U.S. said the group was “engaged
in ongoing cyber operations against worldwide targets to gain intelligence for North Korea, specifically on foreign policy and national
security issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and
sanctions.”194 The group specifically targets experts, think tanks, and
government agencies in South Korea, Japan, and the United States.
In February 2021, the U.S. government issued an alert about the
Lazarus group’s targeting of individuals and companies, including
cryptocurrency exchanges and financial service companies, with
malware to steal cryptocurrency. Lazarus targeted cryptocurrency
organizations in more than 30 countries during 2020 using cryptocurrency malware, referred to as AppleJeus. North Korea has used
AppleJeus malware posing as cryptocurrency trading platforms since
at least 2018. The malware appears to be from a legitimate cryptocurrency trading company to fool individuals into downloading it from
what appears to be a legitimate website. Lazarus also uses phishing,
social networking, and social engineering techniques to lure users into
downloading the malware.195
In February 2021, the U.S. government unsealed a December 2020
indictment against three North Korean hackers (Jon Chang-hyok,
Kim Il, and Park Jin-hyok) accused of committing a series of cyberattacks and attempting to steal or extort more than $1.3 billion worth

of money and cryptocurrency from cyber heists and forced ATM
cashouts. The case was an expansion of a 2018 case involving the Sony
and WannaCry hacks. An accompanying case related to a Canadian-American citizen who pled guilty to money laundering.196

In March 2021, for the first time, the U.S. extradited a North Korean
intelligence operative from overseas. Mun Chol-myong, affiliated
with the Reconnaissance General Bureau, was accused of defrauding
banks and laundering money through the U.S. financial system “in
transactions valued at over $1.5 million” by using “a web of front companies and bank accounts registered to false names and remov[ing]
references to [North Korea] from international wire transfer and
transactional documents.”197
