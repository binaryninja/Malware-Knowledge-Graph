Transparent Tribe Targets Educational Institution

Recently we came across a Twitter feed that described a Transparent Tribe malware
sample targeting Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad and the sample was fairly
new and did not have many detections (at the time of writing this blog) which attracted our
interest in diving deeper into the sample.
Transparent Tribe aka APT36 or Mythic Leopard is suspected to be of Pakistani origin
and primarily targets Indian government and military entities, as per public reports .
Transparent Tribe has been active since 2013 and has targeted government organizations
in around 30 countries. Their usual attack sequence is to create fake domains mimicking
the government organization and then deliver the payload. It frequently uses Crimson
RAT, a Windows based Remote Admin Tool which provides unauthorized access to a
victim’s device over a network.
In 2019, we in K7 Labs published an article about Transparent Tribe targeting the CLAWS,
a security think tank team affiliated with the Indian Army. Recently similar kinds of attacks
have been happening more frequently, targeting state governments and other government
institutions. Transparent Tribe recently targeted the West Bengal government employees
by sending a spoofed document (of a legitimate government document) which delivers a
Crimson RAT payload. Our sample of interest now, also delivers a document pretending to
be a legitimate survey form by IIT Hyderabad. Once the document is opened, it asks the
user to enable a macro through which it can run the VBA script.

Figure 1: Survey form with macro
We used oletools to extract the VBA script from the macro. We then gleaned that this was
the same method which had been used before. The malicious macro contained one Form
Object for which the first two values are “80” “75” which when converted to ASCII will be
“PK” indicating Pakistan that adds suspicion that this attack could be of Pakistan origin.

Figure 2:

VBA script
While executing the document it runs the VBA script. Like the other Transparent Tribe
variants, in this VBA script it creates a new directory E0d1 under C:\ProgramData\ and
writes the array of values from the VBA into a file Chairtabkjh.zip in that directory. The zip
file contains the executable file named Chairtabkjh8.exe which is extracted in the same
path. The extracted file adds a startup entry to run in the background as a child process of
the word document.

Analysis
We identified that the binary Chairtabkjh8.exe is .NET compiled and protected by CryptoObfuscator. We used Crypto-Deobfuscator to de-obfuscate the binary for analysis.

It uses AMSI (Anti Malware Scan Interface) bypass technique to escape from scanning
of AMSI API.

It also uses Base64 encoding technique to encode the strings and the most common
persistent technique of adding a run entry for the Chairtabkjh8.exe. The registry path is
encoded in Base64 and while executing it decodes and adds the run entry.

After adding the run entry, the next function executed is for delayed execution technique. It
performed a delayed execution technique by holding the execution. It gets the current
system time and holds for 3 minutes before continuing execution.

execution technique
Since we already know Transparent Tribe uses RAT, this sample that is being analyzed
may also use some of these common malicious behaviors of RAT like

4/6

1. List victim’s all files and folders in a C2 specified directory path
2. Run specific processes at the endpoint keylogger
3. Gets the information about the image files like image name, size of image and its
creation time as specified by C2
4. Take screenshots of the present day display screen and send it to C2.
5. Forward keylogger logs to the C2.
6. Send system information including computer name, username etc., to C2
In this scenario, we found only two such behaviors related to Crimson RAT, first one
being Chairtabkjh8.exe sends system information to C2 including computer name and
username. Second activity being it gets the information about the image files like image
name, size of image and its creation time as specified by C2.

5/6

After collecting the data from the victim’s system, it tries to make a TCP connection to
send the data to the C2 server sunnyleone[.]hopto[.]org by using different customized
ports each time to connect to the C2. Since the C2 was down at the time of analysis of this
sample, it was not able to make a successful connection.

It is always advisable to verify if the files or documents are from reputable sources and
exercise caution while using them. Also protect your system by using a reputable security
product such as “K7 Total Security” and keep it updated to stay safe from threats.
