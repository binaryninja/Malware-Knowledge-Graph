A new variant of the BTCWare ransomware was discovered by ID-Ransomware's Michael
Gillespie that appends the .[affiliate_email].nuclear extension to encrypted files. The
BTCWare family of ransomware is distributed by the developers hacking into remote
computers with weak passwords using Remote Desktop services. Once they are able to gain
access to a computer, they will install the ransomware and encrypt the victim's files.
Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by the Nuclear BTCware
Ransomware variant for free. If you wish to discuss this ransomware or receive any support,
you can use our dedicated Btcware Ransomware Support Topic. In the past, the developers
have released the decryption keys for variants that were no longer in distribution. It appears
they decided to no longer offer this to their victims. We hope they change their mind.
Update 8/30/17:
Michael Gillespie discovered that the developers of this variant messed up on the encryption
of files greater than 10MB in file size and will not be able to decrypt them. It was also
discovered that this same behavior was seen with other files of random sizes. Therefore, it is
advised that you do not pay the ransom as there is a good chance many of your files not be
able to be decrypted.

What's New in the Nuclear Ransomware BTCWare Variant
While overall the encryption methods stay the same in this variant, there have been some
differences. First and foremost, we have a new ransom note with a file name of HELP.hta.
This ransom note contains instructions to contact black.world@tuta.io for payment
information as shown below.

Nuclear Ransomware (BTCWare) Ransom Note

The next noticeable change is the extension appended to encrypted files. With this version,
when a file is encrypted by the ransomware, it will modify the filename and then append the .
[affiliate_email].nuclear extension to encrypted file's name. For example, the current
version will encrypt a file called test.jpg and rename it to test.jpg.
[black.world@tuta.io].nuclear.
You can see an example of an encrypted folder below.

This variant also uses a different public RSA encryption key that is used to encrypt the
victim's AES encryption key. This public encryption key is:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDMwl0XpgillW5xCvuTbug+U+bVtZTaS0SRM+gNgaegG9PwsU
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

If any new information or methods to decrypt the files becomes available, we will be sure to
update this article.

I got hit with Nuclear this week and after negotiating a price
from $2000 to $500, the decryptor did not do all files,
specially SQL Server files. It rendered my server useless. I look
forward to your findings on this particular ransomeware.

Any Chance of Uploading the Decrypter for Testing?

jarred1990 - 4 years ago

I do not know about you, but I came across the same virus just the mail averia@tuta.io
so the guys rebuilt everything without problems.

I paid for the decrypter as well. It did not decrypt everything. It didn't even touch my
external hard drive despite saying all drives had been decrypted.
Here is the copy of the file provided for decrypting..
https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvi2turvrywwdz8/btcw.zip?dl=0
If anyone can find a way to force it to decrypt specific files, it does show the private key
as well.

You can use my BTCWareDecrypter with the key they gave you, it lets you specify a
directory.

Probably we found a way to recover files with extension [decr@cock.li].nuclear but we
need additional files to do our tests.
If anyone has the same problem could send some files to nuclear_decr@dottormarc.it?

Hi, our files are encrypt with the extension [kod.zapuska@tuta.io].nuclear . if you want
to test i can send you some files.
The File from TechInAFlash (ThX you) doesn't work for us.
I have recovery the Payload.exe. if anybody need it for research i can upload this.

As a note, this message was made with a false assumption about the malware's
behaviour. I've confirmed there is no way to decrypt for a certain email variant
or.anything like that.

Hello, here is link to my files. One file is original .pst Outlook file and the second one is
encrypted with .nuclear, but content must be the same. Please test and compare this
files if you find the key.

You may PM me your ransom note and an encrypted file, and I'll see if I am able to
help.

ebernal - 4 years ago

Hello!! in the link below load two files one is the original and the other is encrypted by

Your files were encrypted by CrySiS/Dharma, which is not decryptable without paying
the criminals.

ebernal - 4 years ago

So, to date, there is no software to decrypt the files?

Demonslay335 - 4 years ago

Not without paying the criminals as I just said. And do not expose RDP to the internet,
put it behind VPN.
