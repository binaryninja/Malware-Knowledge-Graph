A new DeadBolt ransomware group is encrypting QNAP NAS devices worldwide using what
they claim is a zero-day vulnerability in the device's software.
The attacks started today, January 25th, with QNAP devices suddenly finding their files
encrypted and file names appended with a .deadbolt file extension.
Instead of creating ransom notes in each folder on the device, the QNAP device's login
page is hijacked to display a screen stating, "WARNING: Your files have been locked by
DeadBolt," as shown in the image below.

This screen informs the victim that they should pay 0.03 bitcoins (approximately $1,100) to
an enclosed Bitcoin address unique to each victim.
After payment is made, the threat actors claim they will make a follow-up transaction to the
same address that includes the decryption key, which can be retrieved using the following
instructions.

This decryption key can then be entered into the screen to decrypt the device's files.
QNAP has told BleepingComputer that users can bypass the ransom screen and access
their admin page by using the http://nas_ip:8080/cgi-bin/index.cgi or https://nas_ip/cgibin/index.cgi URLs.
BleepingComputer is aware of at least fifteen victims of the new DeadBolt ransomware
attack, with no specific region being targeted.
As with all ransomware attacks against QNAP devices, the DeadBolt attacks only affect
devices accessible to the Internet.

As the threat actors claim the attack is conducted through a zero-day vulnerability, it is
strongly advised that all QNAP users disconnect their devices from the Internet and place
them behind a firewall.
QNAP further told us that their Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is
investigating the attack vectors now and that owners should follow these steps to protect
their data and NAS.
With QNAP owners being targeted by ongoing attacks from two other ransomware families
known as Qlocker and eCh0raix, all owners should follow these steps to prevent future
attacks.
BleepingComputer has created a DeadBolt ransomware support topic that can be used to
discuss the attacks and potentially receive help from other QNAP owners.

Attackers demand 50 bitcoin for master key
On the main ransom note screen, there is a link titled "important message for QNAP," that
when clicked, will display a message from the DeadBolt gang specifically for QNAP.
On this screen, the DeadBolt ransomware gang is offering the full details of the alleged
zero-day vulnerability if QNAP pays them 5 Bitcoins worth $184,000.
They are also willing to sell QNAP the master decryption key that can decrypt the files for all
affected victims and the zero-day info for 50 bitcoins, or approximately $1.85 million.
"Make a bitcoin payment of 50 BTC to bc1qnju697uc83w5u3ykw7luujzupfyf82t6trlnd8," the
threat actors wrote in a message to QNAP.
"You will receive a universal decryption master key (and instructions) that can be used to
unlock all your clients their files. Additionally, we will also send you all details about the
zero-day vulnerability to security@qnap.com."

The ransomware gang further states that there is no way to contact them other than through
Bitcoin payments.
This method of communication is a very different approach than other ransomware attacks
that usually provide some form of communication, whether through a dedicated Tor website,
email, or messaging platforms.

QNAP force updates to
On January 26th, QNAP began force-updating customers' NAS devices to firmware version
5.0.0.1891, which is the latest universal firmware released on December 23rd, 2021.
QNAP told BleepingComputer that they forced-installed this update as they believe the
threat actors are using a remote code execution vulnerability fixed in the 5.0.0.1891
firmware version.
However, a customer posted to the QNAP forum stating that they were encrypted even
when they had this firmware version installed, indicating that the threat actors are
likely exploiting a different vulnerability.

"Confirmed getting hit with deadbolt while using 5.0.0.1891 build 20211221 on a tvs1282t3," the NAS owner posted to the QNAP forums.
After asking for a comment on this, QNAP conceded that it could be another vulnerability
exploited by the threat actors.
"All the information we have shows DEADBOLT could be prevented with the build.
Theoretically, we cannot exclude the possibility that there is the other vulnerability exploited.
We are also interested in the user's observation," QNAP told BleepingComputer.
"If possible, we would suggest users with similar situation could submit a ticket to Technical
Support."
QNAP also told BleepingComputer that the update should only have been installed by those
with the 'Recommended version' setting enabled in the Auto Updates settings, as shown
below.

QNAP asks customers to contact technical support if they are still receiving updates with
that setting unchecked.

DeadBolt technical details
When a QNAP NAS device is compromised, the threat actors will install the DeadBolt
malware executable as a randomly named file in the /mnt/HDA_ROOT/ folder. For
example, the DeadBolt ransomware executable could be located at
/mnt/HDA_ROOT/27855.

Ransomware expert Michael Gillespie told BleepingComputer that ransomware is initially
launched with a config file, which likely contains various data, including an encryption key
used to encrypt files.
The initial command to encrypt files is:
[random_file_name] -e [config] /share

The /share folder is where QNAP NAS devices store user folders and files.
When encrypting files, the ransomware will only target files with the following file
extensions:
.3dm, .3ds, .3fr, .3g2, .3gp, .3pr, .ab4, .accdb, .accdc, .accde, .accdr, .accdt,

Gillespie says the files are encrypted with AES128 encryption and will have the .deadbolt
extension appended to file names. For example, test.jpg will be encrypted and renamed to
test.jpg.deadbolt.
DeadBolt will also replace the /home/httpd/index.html file so that when victims access the
device, they will see the ransom screen demanding a ransom of 0.03 bitcoins to a specified
bitcoin address.

If a ransom is paid, the threat actors will create a bitcoin transaction to the same
bitcoin ransom address that contains the decryption key for the victim. The decryption key is
located under the OP_RETURN output, as shown below.

When you enter this key into the ransom note screen, the web page will convert it into a
SHA256 hash and compare it to the SHA256 hash of the victim's decryption key and the
SHA256 hash of the master decryption key.
The SHA256 hash for the master decryption key
is 93f21756aeeb5a9547cc62dea8d58581b0da4f23286f14d10559e6f89b078052.
If the decryption key matches either SHA256 hash, it will decrypt the files using the
following command:
/mnt/HDA_ROOT/[encryptor_name] -d "[decryption_key]" /share

Multiple victims have reported paying the ransom and receiving a decryption key that has
successfully decrypted their files.
However, QNAP's forced firmware updates are causing the executable and index.html
ransom screen to be deleted from the device, which prevents the decryption of files.
Gillespie has created a free Windows decryptor that can be downloaded from Emsisoft and
decrypt files without needing the ransomware executable. However, users will still need a
valid decryption key, which QNAP owners can only obtain at this time by paying a ransom.
Update: Added further information on how the decryption key will be retrieved.
Update 1/26/22: Added further information from QNAP
Update 1/28/22: Added technical details, information on exploited vulnerabilities, and
number of victims.

Exposing your NAS to the WAN ... "What could possibly go wrong"

9/10

Neo8019 - 3 months ago

I don't even expose any containers to the internet let alone the NAS.

marvin_martian - 3 months ago

yep it was stupid to think I could secure the nas and expose to the web depending on
qnap to lock down their vulnerabilities. last time I buy from qnap. it will remain local
and will never purchase from them again. fortunately Im a backup freak and was able
to get 90% of my data back. what I lost was not important and they only locked about
10% of the 1 share I had. the others were untouched.
