NK News | A screenshot of the LinkedIn account of “Kim Hui-jung,” which evidence
suggests is run by a North Korea-linked attacker posing as a KBS scriptwriter
An NK News investigation has uncovered connections between the North Korea-linked
phishing scam against DPRK defector Kang Mi-jin earlier this month and at least two other
attacks, suggesting the extent of the sophisticated social-engineering scheme is larger than
previously understood.
Late last month, an account under the name Kim Hui-jung (김희정) attempted to add
several NK News journalists as friends on various social media platforms. On LinkedIn, Kim
claimed she was a scriptwriter for the Seoul-based Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and
needed help on an upcoming piece pertaining to North Korea.
