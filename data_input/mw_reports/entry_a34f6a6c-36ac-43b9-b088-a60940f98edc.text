July 11, 2022

A large-scale phishing campaign leveraging the Anubis Network is
targeting Brazil and Portugal since March 2022.
A large-scale phishing campaign is targeting Internet-end users in Brazil and Portugal since
March 2022. Anubis Network is a C2 portal developed to control fake portals and aims to
steal credentials to fully access the real systems.
This C2 server is controlled by a group of operators that come from the previous analysis in
2022, the various brands being divided among the operators of the group (in a call
center modus operandi).
This campaign is highlighted by Segurança Informática in 2020, and the high-level
diagram of this new campaign can be observed below.

Figure 1: High-level diagram of the ANUBIS phishing network and its components (2020).
In detail, this fresh campaign is composed of three crucial operating components:
the delivery vehicle to propagate the landing page in the wild; usually carried out
through smishing (SMS) and phishing (email)
a malicious landing page hosted on a cloud server, composed of a user interface
and layout very similar to the real system
an operation back-end that allows criminals to manage the details of users who
have fallen into the trap.
Figure 2 presents an example of an SMS sent to Internet end-users during the ANUBIS
social engineering wave. The image is related to an ongoing campaign in Portugal
impersonating a specific organization to steal banking credentials.

SMSs are sent based on a list created by the C2 owner, namely: 1kk-rusha-01.txt.
Fake domains hosted automatically on Cloudflare CDN
The ANUBIS network phishing campaigns are masked through the Cloudflare CDN.
Operators can easily make this configuration through an interface that uses the CloudFlare
API for configuring new DNS zones.

via the ANUBIS back office portal.
The Phishing template
One of the last campaigns disseminated by criminals is impersonating a popular service in
Portugal with the goal of stealing credentials of home banking portals.
After clicking on the link distributed via smishing, the victims are redirected to a specific
landing page that collects the mobile phone number and the associated code (PIN). As
observed, criminals are using the Let’s Encrypt CA to create valid HTTPs certificates.

After clicking on “CONTINUAR“, a new page is presented. Additional data from the victim are
requested by the server-side and added to session cookies.

Figure 5: Additional details about the victims are stored on the session cookies.
As observed, 12 target banks operating in Portugal are listed in this specific campaign.

In the next step, credentials to access the target portals are requested.

Figure 7: Credentials to access the real systems are requested.
Additional details related to credit cards are also requested by criminals. A specific loading
page is then presented, and ANUBIS operators can request other details via the C2 portal in
a call center modus operandi.

By analyzing the landing page source code, the URL of the C2 server can be obtained.

Figure 9: Endpoint of the Anubis Network C2 server present on the source code.
As observed, the C2 login page is linked to a legitimate system in order to confuse threat
analysts.

The features observed inside the C2 server are very similar to the analysis performed in
2020. Operators can control all the infection flow by requesting additional details and
accessing the real system in the background.

In detail, global administrators are capable of adding users to specific target organizations as
observed below.

According to the MySQL database that supports the system, there are 77 operators in the
system – which represents the business and operational volume of this malicious scheme.

An interesting feature also implemented in this new version of the C2 portal is the email
temp. By using this feature, criminals can create new domains and use internal emails to
manage all the processes.

The landing pages presented to the victims and specific data can be configured on the
Anubis Network administrative portal. The path of the folder and the target brand can be
observed on this specific page.

Since the malicious network is made up of many people, a channel on Telegram was created
in order to provide technical support to operators in the performance of their duties.

The MySQL database
The heart of the ANUBIS network is a MySQL database. This database is used for data
synchronization between all components of the malicious ecosystem and maintains
everything up-to-date each second.
