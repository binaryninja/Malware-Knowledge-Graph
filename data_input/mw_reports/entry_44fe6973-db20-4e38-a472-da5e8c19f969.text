Ransomware
We analyzed new samples of the Yanluowang ransomware. One interesting aspect of these
samples is that the files are code-signed. They also terminate various processes which are
related to database and backup management.

The ransomware then encrypts the files from the provided file path on the argument,
appends the extension (.yanluowang), then drops the ransom note (README.txt).

Digital signature, other features also found
It is important to highlight that the samples obtained are code-signed with a digital signature
— and a valid one on that note, during the time of the analysis. The question remains
whether this signature was stolen from a company or fraudulently signed.
Code signing is performed to validate the authenticity of a piece of software; thus, codesigned malware can appear legitimate and non-malicious, allowing it to bypass certain
security measures.

Upon execution, the ransomware also terminates the following processes, which are related
to managing databases and backups, through Windows API:
Veeam
SQL
The termination of database-related processes could potentially lead to loss of access to
backup files, which then places additional pressure on ransomware victims to pay up to
retrieve their files.

Terminating processes
The ransomware also attempts to terminate a few more processes through the command
prompt if they match the following strings:
mysql*
dsa*
veeam*
chrome*
iexplore*
firefox*
outlook*
excel*
taskmgr*
tasklist*

Aside from processes, the malware will also forcefully stop (through net stop command line)
the following services:

Strengthening defenses against ransomware
As new ransomware families continue to emerge, we foresee in our 2022 security predictions
report that ransomware operators will use more modern and sophisticated methods of
extortion. Moving forward, enterprises must then take extra caution in applying preventive
measures.
It would also help enterprises to establish frameworks that would help them with ransomware
defense. Here are some of the best practices that they can include in their frameworks:
Audit and take inventoryof assets and data, authorized and unauthorized devices and
software, and logs of events and incidents.
Configure and monitorhardware and software configurations, and only grant admin
privileges and access when absolutely necessary to an employee’s role.
Patch and update for operating systems and applications, perform regular vulnerability
assessments, and conduct patching or virtual patching for operating systems and
applications.
Protect and recover essential information and files byenforcing stringent data
protection, backup, and recovery measures.

Perform security skills assessment and training regularly and conduct red-team
exercises and penetration tests.
Secure and defend systems by employing the latest version of security solutions to all
layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network.
Trend Micro Vision One™ offers multilayered protection and behavior detection, allowing for
the detection of and blocking ransomware early on before it can do any real damage to the
system. This is done by identifying questionable behavior that might otherwise seem benign
when viewed from only a single layer.
Trend Micro Cloud One™ – Workload Security defends systems against both known and
unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities through techniques such as virtual patching and
machine learning. It also leverages the latest in global threat intelligence to provide timely,
real-time protection.
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and
advanced analysis techniques to effectively block ransomware before it gets into the system,
blocking phishing emails that can be used by ransomware as entry points.
Trend Micro Apex One™ provides a closer inspection of endpoints through next-level
automated threat detection and response against advanced concerns such as fileless threats
and ransomware.

We analyzed new samples of the Yanluowang ransomware, a recently discovered
ransomware family. One interesting aspect of these samples is that the files are code-signed
using a valid digital signature, which was either stolen or fraudulently signed. They also
terminate various processes including Veeam and SQL, which are related to database and
backup management.
After being uncovered a few weeks ago, the Yanluowang ransomware (named after the
Chinese deity Yanluo Wang) has since been associated with campaigns, and its operators
are said to launch targeted attacks on US corporations since at least August this year.

Yanluowang ransomware initial analysis
The Yanluowang ransomware samples we analyzed still have only a few detections as of this
writing. Just looking at the files themselves shows very little about where or how they arrived
at a user’s system. But since the samples require certain arguments for proper execution, it
appears that the most likely scenario for their execution is through remote desktop tools.

8/9

We also believe that the files analyzed here are merely part of a toolkit used by operators
once they have compromised their victims’ machines.
From our initial analysis, the ransomware checks for the following arguments that are
primarily used to specify the directory where it would do its encryption:
-h/--help
-p/-path/--path
-pass
