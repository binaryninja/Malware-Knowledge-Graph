SpyEye Botnet’s Bogus Billing Feature
krebsonsecurity.com/2010/09/spyeye-botnets-bogus-billing-feature/

Miscreants who control large groupings of hacked PCs or “botnets” are always looking for
ways to better monetize their crime machines, and competition among rival bot developers is
leading to devious innovations. The SpyEye botnet kit, for example, now not only allows
botnet owners to automate the extraction of credit card and other financial data from infected
systems, but it also can be configured to use those credentials to generate bogus sales at
online stores set up by the botmaster.
As I noted in a post in April, SpyEye is a software package that promises to make running a
botnet a point-and-click exercise. A unique component of SpyEye is a feature called
“billinghammer,” which automates the purchase of worthless or copycat software using credit
card data stolen from victims of the botnet.
The SpyEye author explained this feature in detail on several hacking forums where his kit is
sold, even including a video that walks customers through the process of setting it up.
Basically, the scam works like this: The botmaster acquires some freeware utility or
legitimate program, renames it, claims it as his own and places it up for sale at one of

several pre-selected software sales and
distribution platforms, including ClickBank,
FastSpring, eSellerate, SetSystems, or Shareit.
The botmaster then logs in to his SpyEye
control panel (picture above), feeds it a list of
credit card numbers and corresponding
cardholder data, after which SpyEye opens an
Internet Explorer Window and — at user-defined
intervals — starts auto-filling the proper fields at
the botmaster’s online store and making
purchases.
The billinghammer module also is set up to
evade anti-fraud controls at the online software
stores, by funneling each transaction through a
SpyEye-infected system whose Internet
address traces back to a geographic location
that approximates the cardholder’s street
addresss.
In the video that shows how to use this portion
of the bot kit, it appears that SpyEye customers
have the option either to make sales at their
own stores, or to use some that are apparently
set up by the author of the bot kit himself.
In an e-mail to KrebsOnSecurity.com,
FastSpring’s chief customer service officer Ken
White said: “We understand what this system tries to do, and how the bad guys attempt to
use it to convert stolen cards into cash. We haven’t yet been exploited successfully and
believe we have a good system in place to prevent it.”
All other software sales and distribution systems coded into the SpyEye bot kit are entities
operated by Digital River, which did not respond to repeated requests for comment. It’s not
clear how many — if any — SpyEye customers are using the billinghammer plug-in. But
assuming that there are some scammers out there abusing these services through SpyEye,
it seems that it would be a great way to catch botmasters in the act. After all, the check or
wire transfer for any bogus software sales has to be sent somewhere.
