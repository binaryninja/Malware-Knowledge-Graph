June 1, 2021

In this second edition of the Cybersecurity Threat Spotlight, we’re examining the most
important current threats including a backdoor threat, a remote access trojan (RAT), and a
loader. Obfuscation, encryption, weaponization of normally benign files, and remote
(frequently C2) execution continue to be primary techniques in ongoing use.

Threat Name: GoldMax
Threat Type: Backdoor
Actor: NOBELIUM

Delivery and Exfiltration:

1/7

Cisco Umbrella detects SUNBURST domains, domains hosting GoldMax payload, and C&C
servers.
Description: GoldMax (also known as SUNSHUTTLE) is a post-exploitation malware
currently used as part of a SUNBURST attack. SUNBURST uses multiple techniques to
obfuscate its actions and evade detection. GoldMax persists on systems as a scheduled
task, impersonating systems management software.
GoldMax Spotlight: Written in Go, GoldMax acts as a command-and-control backdoor for
the actor. The malware writes an encrypted configuration file to disk, where the file name and
AES-256 cipher keys are unique per implant, and based on environmental variables and
information about the network where it is running. The C2 can send commands to be
launched for various operations, including native OS commands, via pseudo-randomly
generated cookies. The hardcoded cookies are unique to each implant, mapping to victims
and operations on the actor side. GoldMax is equipped with a decoy network traffic
generation feature that allows it to surround its malicious network traffic with seemingly
benign traffic.
Target geolocations: North America, Europe
Target data: Any
Target businesses: Government, public entities, private entities
Mitre Att&ck, GoldMax
Initial access: Supply chain compromise

packing, indirect command execution, masquerade task or service, system checks
Collection: N/A
Command and Control: Encrypted channel: symmetric cryptography, data encoding, data
obfuscation, ingress tool transfer, web protocols
Exfiltration: exfiltration over C2 channel

Threat Name: ObliqueRAT
Threat Type: Remote Access Trojan
Actor: Transparent Tribe
Delivery and Exfiltration:

3/7

Cisco Umbrella detects domains hosting malicious documents, malicious Zip files, and C&C
servers.
Description: Oblique is a popular Remote Access Trojan, currently being used to take
remote control of infected systems and steal data. The malware has the following
capabilities: get the running process on the system, get the drives, directories, and files on
the system, get the host names, user IDs, capture screenshots, get the data from C2 server,
using custom ports to connect to C2 server.
ObliqueRAT Spotlight: ObliqueRAT is related to CrimsonRAT, sharing the same malware
documents and macros, but using its macro code to download its malicious payload from
actor-controlled websites. The malicious payload appears to be benign BMP image files.
These files contain a ZIP, which holds the ObliqueRAT payload. Once downloaded and
extracted, the file is renamed with a .pif file extension. Persistence is achieved by creating a
shortcut with a .URL file extension in the infected user’s Startup.
Target geolocations: South Asia
Target data: Credentials from web browsers, data from removable media, local email
collection
Target businesses: Any
Mitre Att&ck, ObliqueRAT
Initial access: Phishing
Persistence: Registry run keys / startup folder
Execution: Scheduled task/job
Evasion: Impair defenses
Collection: File and directory discovery, process discovery, screen capture, security
software discovery, system Information discovery, system network configuration discovery
Command and control: Data obfuscation
Exfiltration: Ingress tool transfer, exfiltration over command and control channel using nonapplication layer protocol

Threat Name: NimzaLoader
Threat Type: Loader
Actor: TA800
Delivery and Exfiltration:

5/7

Cisco Umbrella detects domains hosting malicious documents, malicious NimzaLoader
payload, C&C servers and Cobalt Strike communications.
Description: NimzaLoader is part of a malware family used by the TA800 threat group to
gain a foothold in compromised enterprise networks. This threat group previously used
BazaLoader before switching to the new NimzaLoader in February 2021.
NimzaLoader Spotlight: NimzaLoader is written in the Nim programming language in an
attempt to avoid detection. JSON files are used for data storage, memory management, and
C&C communication and it does not use a domain generation algorithm. Second-stage
payload is most commonly Cobalt Strike.
Exploitation begins with phishing emails to victims containing personalized details that can
be found on social networking sites such as LinkedIn. The emails contain a link, labeled as
‘PDF-preview’ that leads to a NimzaLoader download webpage.
NimzaLoader makes use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe to inject shellcode into a process
on Windows systems. It utilizes a heartbeat mechanism to update expiration dates of the
malware in memory and encodes other data in a JSON object.
Target geolocations: Any
Target data: Any
Target businesses: Any
Exploits: N/A
