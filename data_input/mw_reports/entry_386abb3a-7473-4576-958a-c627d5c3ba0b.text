**************************************************************************
SECTION 25 05 11
CYBERSECURITY FOR FACILITY-RELATED CONTROL SYSTEMS
11/17
**************************************************************************
NOTE: This guide specification covers the
requirements for cybersecurity for facility-related
control systems.
Adhere to UFC 1-300-02 Unified Facilities Guide
Specifications (UFGS) Format Standard when editing
this guide specification or preparing new project
specification sections. Edit this guide
specification for project specific requirements by
adding, deleting, or revising text. For bracketed
items, choose applicable item(s) or insert
appropriate information.
Remove information and requirements not required in
respective project, whether or not brackets are
present.
Comments, suggestions and recommended changes for
this guide specification are welcome and should be
as a Criteria Change Request (CCR).
**************************************************************************

**************************************************************************
Note: Facility-related control systems are a subset
of control systems that are used to monitor and
control equipment and systems related to DoD real
property facilities (e.g., building control systems,
utility control systems, electronic security
systems, and fire and life safety systems). This
section includes Cybersecurity requirements to be
included on every DOD project which includes a
facility-related control system. This Section does
not provide general requirements for a control
system, nor are the requirements in this section
sufficient to procure a control system. This
section must be used in conjunction with another
controls system specification. For example, for a
HVAC controls project, this section should be used
in conjunction with Section 23 09 00 and related
sections.

SECTION 25 05 11

Page 4

Requirements and activities in this section must be
coordinated with the other relevant control
specification sections.
This section includes requirements in support of the
DOD Risk Management Framework (RMF) for implementing
cybersecurity. Refer to UFC 4-010-06, Cybersecurity
for Facility-Related Control Systems for
requirements on incorporating cybersecurity into
control system design and for general information on
the RMF process as it applies to control systems.
Assistance for control system cybersecurity is
available from the following Service organizations:
Army: Control System Cybersecurity Center of
Expertise,
Huntsville Engineering and Support Center
Navy: Naval Facilities Engineering Command,
Command Information Office (CIO)
Air Force: Civil Engineer Maintenance,
Inspection, and Repair Team (CEMIRT)
ICS Branch, Tyndall AFB
Marine Corps: Contact Navy POC for Marine Corps
POC information
Since this Section covers a wide range of control
systems, and those systems often have different
capabilities and requirements, there are
requirements identified in this Section which need
extensive designer input or decisions.
Many designer selections in this Section will
require coordination with the project site, System
Owner, Authorizing Official or a subject matter
expert in the specific control systems being
installed.
**************************************************************************

**************************************************************************
NOTE: This Section is for use on control systems
with no impact rating higher than LOW. If the
project includes systems where there systems with
impact ratings of MODERATE or HIGH, this
specification must be modified to include those
additional requirements.
Systems of different types at the same impact level
may have different requirements based on the
specific needs and capabilities of the control
system. This is addressed in this Guide
Specification by indicating when requirements apply
to a specific system type.
Systems of the same type may have different
requirements. This may be due to those systems
having different impact levels or due to
system-specific requirements for systems at the same
SECTION 25 05 11

Page 5

impact level.
If a project includes multiple systems, it's
critical that it be clear which requirements apply
to which systems. This can be done by a) using a
single Section and specifying the applicability of
requirements or b) using multiple Sections. Which
approach to employ depends on the needs of the
project and the preferences of the specifier and
project manager. If using multiple sections use the
fourth level specification numbering to
differentiate the Sections and indicate in each
which systems the Section applies to.

PART 1

GENERAL

**************************************************************************
NOTE: This subpart points the contractor to the
locations of STIGs and SRGs, as this Section
requires the contractor to meet available STIGs or
SRGs. It's not necessary for the designer/specifier
to review the STIGs or SRGs for applicability. The
contractor is responsible for determining which
STIGs or SRGs are applicable and for meeting the
relevant requirements.
**************************************************************************
Many subparts in this Section contain text in curly braces ("{" and "}")
indicating which cybersecurity control and control correlation identifier
(CCI) the requirements of the subpart relate to. The text inside these
curly braces is for Government reference only, and enables coordination of
the requirements of this Section with the RMF process throughout the design
and construction process. Text in curly braces are not contractor
requirements.
This Section refers to Security Requirements Guide (SRGs) and Security
Technical Implementation Guide (STIGs). STIGs and SRGs are are available
online at the Information Assurance Support Environment (IASE) website at
http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/Pages/index.aspx. Not all control system
components have applicable STIGs or SRGs.

DEFINITIONS

1.4.1

Computer

and Services

As used in this Section, a computer is one of the following:
a.

a device running a non-embedded desktop or server version of Microsoft
Windows

b.

a device running a non-embedded version of MacOS

c.

a device running a non-embedded version of Linux

d.

a device running a version or derivative of the Android OS, where
Android is considered separate from Linux

e.

a device running a version of Apple iOS

1.4.2

Network Connected

A component is network connected (or "connected to a network") only when
the device has a network transceiver which is directly connected to the
network and implements the network protocol. A device lacking a network
transceiver (and accompanying protocol implementation) can never be
considered network connected. Note that a device connected to a non-IP
network is still considered network connected (an IP connection or IP
address is not required for a device to be network connected).
Any device that supports wireless communication is network connected,
regardless of whether the device is communicating using wireless.
1.4.3

User Account Support Levels

The support for user accounts is categorized in this Section as one of
three levels:
1.4.3.1

FULLY Supported

Device supports configurable individual accounts. Accounts can be created,
deleted, modified, etc. Privileges can be assigned to accounts.

SECTION 25 05 11

Page 8

1.4.3.2

MINIMALLY Supported

Device supports a small, fixed number of accounts (perhaps only one).
Accounts cannot be modified. A device with only a "User" and an
"Administrator" account would fit this category. Similarly, a device with
two PINs for logon - one for restricted and one for unrestricted rights
would fit here (in other words, the accounts do not have to be the
traditional "user name and password" structure).
1.4.3.3

NOT Supported

Device does not support any Access Enforcement therefore the whole concept
of "account" is meaningless.
1.4.4

User Interface

Generally, a user interface is hardware on a device allowing user
interaction with that device via input (buttons, switches, sliders,
keyboard, touch screen, etc.) and a screen. There are three types of user
interfaces defined in this Section: Limited Local User Interface, Full
Local User Interface and Remote User Interface. In this Section, when the
term "User Interface" is used without specifying which type, it refers only
to Full Local User Interface and Remote User Interface (NOT to Limited
Local User Interface).
1.4.4.1

Limited Local User Interface

A Limited Local User Interface is a user interface where the interaction is
limited, fixed at the factory, and cannot be modified in the field. The
user must be physically at the device to interact with it.
Examples of Limited Local User Interface include thermostats (Space Sensor
Modules as defined in Section 23 09 13 INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROL DEVICES
FOR HVAC).
1.4.4.2

Full Local User Interface

A Full Local User Interface is a user interface where the interaction and
displays are field-configurable.
Examples of a Full Local User Interface include local applications on a
computer and user interfaces to Variable Speed Drives.
1.4.4.3

Remote User Interface

A Remote User Interface is a user interface on a Client device allowing
user interaction with a different Server device. The user need not be
physically at the Server device to interact with it.
Examples of Remote User Interfaces include web browsers and Local Display
Panels as defined in Section 23 09 00 INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROL FOR HVAC.
1.5
1.5.1

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS
Coordination

**************************************************************************
NOTE: This subpart deals with coordination
requirements for the contractor, and does not
SECTION 25 05 11

Page 9

indicate coordination that must be done by the
designer/specifier. In addition to the normal
project coordination, authorization for wireless
use, alternate account lock permissions and devices
with multiple IP connections may be impacted by site
(or Service) policies and need to be coordinated
with the appropriate Government representatives
before authorization is provided.
**************************************************************************
Coordinate the execution of this Section with the execution of all other
Sections related to control systems as indicated in the paragraph RELATED
REQUIREMENTS. Items that must be considered when coordinating project
efforts include but are not limited to:
a.

If requesting permission for wireless communication, the Wireless
Communication Request submittal must be approved prior to control
system device selection and integration.

b.

If requesting permission for alternate account lock permissions, the
Device Account Lock Exception Request must be approved prior to control
system device selection and integration.

c.

If requesting permission for the use of a device with multiple IP
connections, the Multiple IP Connection Device Request must be approved
prior to control system device selection and integration.

d.

Wireless testing may be required as part of the control system
testing. See requirements for the Wireless Communication Test Report
submittal.

e.

If the Device Audit Record Upload Software is to be installed on a
computer not being provided as part of the control system, coordination
is required to identify the computer on which to install the software.

f.

Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule must be coordinated with other
work that will be interconnected to, and interconnections must be
approved by the Government before relying on them for system
functionality.

g.

Cybersecurity testing support must be coordinated across control
systems and with the Government cybersecurity testing schedule.

h.

Passwords must be coordinated with the indicated contact for the
project site.

i.

If applicable, HTTP web server certificates must be obtained from the
indicated contact for the project site.

j.

Contractor Computer Cybersecurity Compliance Statements for each
contractor using contractor owned computers.

1.6

SUBMITTALS

**************************************************************************
NOTE: Review Submittal Description (SD) definitions
in Section 01 33 00 SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit
the following list to reflect only the submittals
required for the project.
SECTION 25 05 11

Page 10

The Guide Specification technical editors have
designated those items that require Government
approval, due to their complexity or criticality,
with a "G." Generally, other submittal items can be
reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control
System. Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal
is sufficiently important or complex in context of
the project.
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army
projects, a code of up to three characters within
the submittal tags may be used following the "G"
designation to indicate the approving authority.
Codes for Army projects using the Resident
Management System (RMS) are: "AE" for
Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office
(Engineering Division or other organization in the
District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for
Resident Office; and "PO" for Project Office. Codes
following the "G" typically are not used for Navy,
Air Force, and NASA projects.
An "S" following a submittal item indicates that the
submittal is required for the Sustainability
eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable
requirements in accordance with Section 01 33 29
SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING. Locate the "S" submittal
under the SD number that best describes the
submittal item.
Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force
and NASA projects, or choose the second bracketed
item for Army projects.
**************************************************************************

**************************************************************************
NOTE: All submittals in this Guide Specification
require Government approval and must have a "G"
designation.
Government review of submittals in this Section
impact Cybersecurity, and must be coordinated with
the appropriate Cybersecurity experts to ensure
appropriate review and the identification of issues
or concerns that may affect the cybersecurity
posture of the system or the ability of the system
to receive an RMF authorization.
**************************************************************************
Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation;
submittals not having a "G" designation are [for Contractor Quality Control
approval.][for information only. When used, a designation following the
"G" designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for
the Government.] Submittals with an "S" are for inclusion in the
Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance with Section 01 33 29

**************************************************************************
NOTE: If there are regulatory requirements related
to a control system, specify those in the control
system specification. If there are regulatory
requirements related to cybersecurity for a control
system they can be specified here.
Regulatory requirements specified here must indicate
which system or systems they apply to, DO NOT
SECTION 25 05 11

include requirements here that are not directly
linked to a specific control system.
For typical UMCS or building control system projects
there will not be requirements to include here.
**************************************************************************
For the [_____] control system:
][1.7.2

[Certifications][Qualifications]

**************************************************************************
NOTE: If there are contractor qualification or
certification requirements related to the control
system, specify those in the control system
specification. If there are contractor
qualifications or certifications specifically
related to cybersecurity they can be specified here.
Use care when including requirements here, as many
cybersecurity certifications are IT-centric and do
not apply to control systems.
Requirements specified here must indicate which
system or systems they apply to, DO NOT include
requirements here that are not directly linked to a
specific control system.
For typical UMCS or building control system projects
there will not be requirements to include here.

Pre-Construction Testing

**************************************************************************
NOTE: If there are cybersecurity Pre-Construction
Testing requirements, include them here.
For a LOW-LOW-LOW Impact system pre-construction
testing will generally not be required. For systems
with a MODERATE or HIGH impact there may be some
pre-construction testing requirements based on the
specific needs of the project site.
Requirements specified here must indicate which
system or systems they apply to, DO NOT include
requirements here that are not directly linked to a

CYBERSECURITY DOCUMENTATION
Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule

**************************************************************************
NOTE: The Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule is
used in two situations:
1) The control system communicates with a separately
authorized system or an unauthorized system. In
this case, include a Cybersecurity Interconnection
Schedule in the design showing the following
interconnection details: Name/description of other
system, POC for the other system, type of
data/information.
2) The control system is a sub-part of a larger
system and will communicate with and integrate to
the larger system (and will be part of the same
authorization as the larger system). In this case,
the control system design must include requirements
for the expected communication between the
sub-system and the larger system. The Cybersecurity
Interconnection Schedule will not be a design
drawing, but will still be a contractor submittal.
If neither of these situations apply (if the system
is stand-alone with no connection or integration to
another system), remove the bracketed text requiring
the Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule, and
remove the Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule
from the SUBMITTALS paragraph of this Section.
If Case 1 applies, keep the bracketed text referring
to Foreign Destination and POC for Destination,
otherwise remove this text.
In situations where both cases apply, a single
submittal will serve both purposes.
Note that this submittal does not create a
requirement for interconnections, but documents
interconnection details in accordance with other
SECTION 25 05 11

Page 14

requirements.
**************************************************************************
{For Reference Only:
CCI-00258}

This subpart (and its subparts) relates to CA-3(b),

Provide a completed Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule documenting
connections between the installed system and other systems. Provide the
following information for each device communicating between systems: Device
Identifier, Device Description, Transport layer Protocol, Network Address,
Port (if applicable), MAC (Layer 2) address (if applicable), Media,
Application Protocol, Service (if applicable), Descriptive Purpose of
communication. [For communication with other authorized systems also
provide the Foreign Destination and POC for Destination.] If other control
system Sections used on this project include submittals documenting this
information, provide copies of those submittals to meet this requirement.

In addition to the requirements of Section 01 33 00 SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES,
provide the Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule as an editable Microsoft
Excel file (a template Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule in Excel
format is available at

Network Communication Report

**************************************************************************
NOTE: Control system specifications should include
requirements related to protocol and documentation.
In the design cybersecurity documentation required
by the UFC, document what, if any, protocol
requirements are included in the control system
specification (CCI-002103). Also document any

2) Requirements to be met by HVAC control devices
3) Requirements to be met by [fill in the blank]
control devices
4) Default requirements for control system
devices (when not covered in 1-3 above)
If the project incorporates devices other than HVAC
devices, and the general requirements in
sub-paragraph 4 are not satisfactory, add
requirements to subparagraph 3. If multiple
different requirements are needed (e.g. the project
incorporates a micro-grid and and an electronic
security system, both with specific requirements)
add additional paragraphs similar to paragraph 3.
Leave the "devices not otherwise covered" at the end
of the list and do not edit those requirements.
Note that within HVAC devices, a further distinction
is made between devices that FULLY support accounts
and those that do not. This distinction is a
surrogate to account for the range of capabilities
and complexity among various HVAC control devices.

define roles (such as operator with view-only,
operator with control, control system admin) for
applications which FULLY support accounts.
Different devices, particularly those with very
different functions and residing at different places
in the system architecture, may require different
account roles.
DO NOT ALLOW AN INTERFACE THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT
ACCOUNTS TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ALTER THE CONTROL
SYSTEM.
The determination of whether a device has a STIG or
SRG, and the installation and configuration of
devices in accordance with relevant STIGs or SRGs
are contractor responsibilities. The
designer/specifier is not expected to identify
relevant STIGs or SRGs

otherwise required for the project.
Keep or include user account requirements for
read-only interfaces. If keeping the requirement,
select the appropriate user account support. In
general either remove this text (to allow read-only
interfaces with no accounts) or keep "at least
MINIMALLY" unless otherwise required for the project.
Unless specifically required by the project DO NOT
keep bracketed text requiring all devices to at
least MINIMALLY support accounts as this increases
system complexity and cost and requires operation

Permitted Actions Without Identification or Authentication

**************************************************************************
NOTE: These requirements are specifically about
user actions, not actions taken automatically by
control system components.
Notes concerning how this requirement addresses
cybersecurity:
1) This requirement indicates that there are
no actions that can be taken without
identification and authentication for any
user interface where account
support is required.
2) This requirement does not limit actions taken
by a user on a user interface that does not
support accounts, but other requirements limit
this to READ-ONLY interfaces.
3) Thus the "permitted actions" referred to by
SECTION 25 05 11

Page 27

control AC-14 are "viewing read-only
information from devices which are not
required to have user accounts."
**************************************************************************
{For Reference Only: This subpart (and its subparts) relates to AC-14;
CCI-000061, CCI-000232}
The control system must require identification and authentication before
allowing any actions by a user acting from a user interface which MINIMALLY
or FULLY supports accounts.
3.1.5

Wireless Access

**************************************************************************
NOTE: Avoid wireless to the greatest extent
possible. Wireless may be considered for retrofits
where running wires would be prohibitive, but other
technologies (such as powerline carrier) should be
considered first.
In general, contractors should never install a
wireless network which carries the IP protocol. The
Air Force may allow wireless IP networks to be
installed in some instances, when it is installed in
accordance with existing site requirements coordinate with the project site to determine if
this is required and remove the bracketed text if
not required.
Note that contractors may (where permitted and
supported) USE a government provided wireless IP
network.
**************************************************************************
{For Reference Only: This subpart (and its subparts) relates to AC-18;
CCI-001438, CCI-001439, CCI-002323, CCI-001441}
Unless explicitly authorized by the Government, do not use any wireless
communication. Any device with wireless communication capability is
considered to be using wireless communication, regardless of whether or not
the device is actively communicating wirelessly, except when wireless
communication has been physically permanently disabled (such as through the
removal of the wireless transceiver).
3.1.5.1

Wireless IP Communications

[Unless specifically approved and installed in accordance with the project
site requirements, d][D]o not install wireless IP networks, including: do
not install a wireless access point; do not install or configure an ad-hoc
wireless network; do not install or configure a WiFi Direct communication.
When explicitly authorized by the Government, wireless IP communication may
be used to communicate with an existing wireless network.
3.1.5.2

Non-IP Wireless Communication

When non-IP wireless communication is explicitly authorized by the
SECTION 25 05 11

Page 28

Government, use the maximum level of encryption supported by the specific
protocol employed and select signal strength and radiated power to the
minimum necessary for reliable communication.
3.1.5.3

Wireless Communication Request

**************************************************************************
NOTE: The wireless communication request submittal
will be used to authorize specific use of wireless
communication, and to indicate whether or not
testing of the signal strength is required. In
general, testing is not required for a LOW impact
system.
There may be project site or Service policies that
govern the use of wireless. Before authorizing
wireless use coordinate with the relevant Service
and project site representatives.

CYBERSECURITY AUDITING

**************************************************************************
SECTION 25 05 11

Page 29

NOTE: Auditing within the control system is a
complex requirement. For standard information
systems, DoD has extensive auditing requirements,
which largely cannot be met within a typical control
system. For more information on auditing, see UFC
4-010-06, Cybersecurity for Facility-Related Control
Systems
DoD requires (see AU-2) the capability to audit the
following events :
a. Successful and unsuccessful attempts to
access, modify, or delete privileges, security
objects, security levels, or categories of
information (e.g. Classification levels)
- generally only applicable to computers.
b. Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts
- generally only applicable to computers and
devices FULLY supporting accounts.
c. Privileged activities or other system level
access - generally only applicable to
computers.
d. Starting and ending time for user access to
the system - generally only applicable to
computers and devices FULLY supporting
accounts.
e. Concurrent logons from different workstations
- generally only applicable to computers and
devices with web interfaces.
f. Successful and unsuccessful accesses to
objects - generally only applicable to
computers.
g. All program initiations - generally only
applicable to computers; for a controller,
this is covered under kernel module actions,
below.
h. All direct access to the information system
- generally only for computers.
i. All account creations, modifications,
disabling, and terminations - generally only
applicable to devices that FULLY support
accounts.
j. All kernel module load, unload, and restart
- this could apply to computers or devices.
DoD also requires that the selection of which events
get audited is under the control of the Information
System Security Manager (ISSM).
DoD requires (see AU-3) that audit records contain
SECTION 25 05 11

Page 30

the following:
type of event
time of the event
location of the event
source of the event
result of the event
the identity of any individuals or subjects
associated with the event.
Note that much of this information will be not
applicable for field control system devices.
DoD requires that all devices in the system be
capable of auditing events, but allows the ISSM to
select which devices must perform auditing (see
AU-12 (b)).
Note that there is a large gap between what is
theoretically required in terms of a capability
("audit all events at all devices") vs. what is
practical and reasonable to implement in a specific
control system. The designer needs to provide input
on what can and cannot be done in terms of what
devices in the system can perform auditing, and what
events can they audit.
Require implementation for what is possible but do
not require unreasonable requirements. Be prepared
to document/explain impractical requirements if
required by the System Owner (SO) or Authorizing
Official (AO)
Control System Alarms:
Control system alarms should have similar
requirements. The designer should specify what
alarms should be generated, which devices should
perform alarm generation, the accuracy of alarm
timestamps, response to alarm generation failures
(e.g. loss of communication with a field device),
and sufficient storage capacity at the front end to
maintain alarm/event logs for a specified period of
time. These requirements should be defined in the
relevant control system specifications, not in this
Section.

disabling unnecessary functionality. Do not install
unnecessary software. Ensure that unnecessary
accounts, maintenance passwords, etc. are all
changed, disabled, or removed.

authorized by the Government. Do not use ports, protocols and services
that are not specified in the control system specifications or required for
operation of the control system.
3.4

SAFE MODE AND FAIL SAFE OPERATION

**************************************************************************
NOTE: The designer should determine, based on the
criticality of the controlled equipment, what
conditions to consider and which actions, if any,
including possible alarm requirements, the control
system should take when these conditions are true.
This should include external conditions (e.g. loss
of off-site utility power), internal conditions
(e.g. network or sensor failure), and operator input
(e.g. manual command to a safe mode of operation).
This should all be specified in the control logic
(e.g. sequence of operations), in particular by
addressing normal/failed positions of output
devices, including default positions upon loss of
network, and in the overall system design. Where
high reliability is required, the analysis should
consider the addition of redundant equipment to the
design. See also guidance on SC-24 (Fail in Known
State), guidance on SI-17 (Fail-Safe Procedures) and
the MINIMUM CYBERSECURITY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS in UFC
4-010-06, Cybersecurity for Facility-Related Control
Systems.
Note that any requirements in the control system
needed to meet CP-12 (Safe Mode) or SI-17 (Fail-Safe
Procedures) should be specified in existing
specifications and design, for example, redundant
AHUs in the mechanical design and sequences of
operation. Any specific requirements for CP-12 or
SI-17 should be addressed in those sections, not in
this UFGS.

This subpart relates to IA-6; CCI-000206}

Devices must never show authentication information, including passwords, on
a display. Devices that momentarily display a character as it is entered,
and then obscure the character, are acceptable. For devices that have
STIGs or SRGs related to obscuring of authenticator feedback (CCI-000206),
comply with the requirements of those STIGS/SRGs.

Device Identification and Authentication

**************************************************************************
NOTE: Indicate whether certificates for HTTPS will
be provided by a Government POC, and if so who will
provide them. Coordinate this requirement with the
project site, and with thecontrol system
specification as this may already be specified there.
Wireless IP communication needs to be explicitly
permitted via the wireless communication request
submittal, and requires an existing
Government-provided WiFi network. If a WiFi network
is available for potential contractor use, include
the bracketed text requiring wireless IP
authentication and coordinate with the IT staff to
indicate the authentication mechanism. If no WiFi
network will be available, remove this bracketed
text.

EMERGENCY POWER

**************************************************************************
NOTE: A long term alternate power supply is almost
never required by the control system itself, this
will usually be required (if at all) by tenant
requirements or by the overall system design and
should seldom be added as an ad-hoc requirement.
Control systems for underlying systems with
alternate power should use that alternate power
source.
A UPS may be desired for specific control system
components where rapid recovery after a power outage
is required, or where the control system itself is
necessary for restoration of power. Again, this
should be driven by mission requirements and control
system specifications should already require
adequate system restoration after loss of power.
If there are specific requirements for either
short-term (UPS) or long-term (generator or
alternate power source), include them as part of the
design and in the relevant specification sections
rather than adding requirements to this section.
Note that use of small local UPSes creates
additional maintenance burdens due to the
requirements for periodic battery replacement and
may ultimately result in a less reliable system.
Brackets are provided here for the EXTREMELY RARE
case in which emergency power requirements must be
specified here. In most cases, keep the bracketed
text indicating emergency power requirements are in
accordance with the control system and equipment
specifications.

DURABILITY TO VULNERABILITY SCANNING

**************************************************************************
NOTE: In general, it won't be possible to assume
that devices will respond to a scanning tool. There
might be specific cases where it is desirable for
devices to provide specific responses to specific
tools. If so, add the appropriate requirements to
indicate the scanning tools and response information.
For computers, select whether the computer must
respond in specific ways to scans. If so, keep the
bracketed text and define specific scanning tools
and response. If not, remove the bracketed text.

SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATION PROTECTION

3.10.1
Denial of Service Protection, Process Isolation and Boundary
Protection
**************************************************************************
NOTE: Implementation of boundary protection is
typically outside the scope of the controls
contractor. The site IT staff should implement
boundary protection via rules (e.g. a firewall)
isolating the control system from the wider
network. This is true even for a control system
which will be later integrated to a larger system;
the field point of connection (FPOC) should be
configured to allow the minimum traffic necessary
for operation. Critical to this is the
Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule, which
defines what traffic must be allowed through the
boundary for the proper operation of the system.
Note that reducing the dependence on the network
helps mitigate threats caused by a weak boundary
defense.

hardware and without reliance on the network.
[3.10.2

Cryptographic Protection

**************************************************************************
NOTE: With regard to cryptography, there are 3
possibilities to consider:
1. The control system contains no classified
information and no cryptography is required. In
that case, there are no UFGS requirements.
2. The control system contains no classified
information, but the Authorizing Official has
determined that cryptography is required. Select
text requiring cryptography.
3. The control system contains classified
information. First, confirm that the system truly
needs to contain classified information - if this is
only to fulfil some reporting requirement, consider
removing the information from the CS and meeting the
reporting requirement via some other means. If the
requirement for cryptography cannot be eliminated,
select text requiring cryptography.
In generally, the need for cryptography should be
avoided, or at least minimized. (Note that even for
systems where cryptography is required, it may not
be required at every node and interconnection in the
system.)
If cryptography is required, select whether to
require it everywhere, only on the IP network, or
only at specific locations within the system.
