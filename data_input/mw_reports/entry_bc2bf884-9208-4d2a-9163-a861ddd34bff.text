2021 Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-117a

Summary
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) was coauthored by cybersecurity authorities of the
United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom: the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber
Security (CCCS), New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NZ NCSC), and United
Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK). This advisory provides details on the
top 15 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) routinely exploited by malicious cyber
actors in 2021, as well as other CVEs frequently exploited.
U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities assess, in 2021,
malicious cyber actors aggressively targeted newly disclosed critical software vulnerabilities
against broad target sets, including public and private sector organizations worldwide. To a
lesser extent, malicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software
vulnerabilities across a broad spectrum of targets.
The cybersecurity authorities encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the
Mitigations section of this CSA. These mitigations include applying timely patches to systems
and implementing a centralized patch management system to reduce the risk of compromise
by malicious cyber actors.

Technical Details
Key Findings
Globally, in 2021, malicious cyber actors targeted internet-facing systems, such as email
servers and virtual private network (VPN) servers, with exploits of newly disclosed
vulnerabilities. For most of the top exploited vulnerabilities, researchers or other actors
released proof of concept (POC) code within two weeks of the vulnerability’s disclosure,
likely facilitating exploitation by a broader range of malicious actors.
To a lesser extent, malicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software
vulnerabilities—some of which were also routinely exploited in 2020 or earlier. The
exploitation of older vulnerabilities demonstrates the continued risk to organizations that fail

1/22

to patch software in a timely manner or are using software that is no longer supported by a
vendor.
Top 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities
Table 1 shows the top 15 vulnerabilities U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK
cybersecurity authorities observed malicious actors routinely exploiting in 2021, which
include:
CVE-2021-44228. This vulnerability, known as Log4Shell, affects Apache’s Log4j
library, an open-source logging framework. An actor can exploit this vulnerability by
submitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to
execute arbitrary code. The request allows a cyber actor to take full control over the
system. The actor can then steal information, launch ransomware, or conduct other
malicious activity.[1] Log4j is incorporated into thousands of products worldwide. This
vulnerability was disclosed in December 2021; the rapid widespread exploitation of this
vulnerability demonstrates the ability of malicious actors to quickly weaponize known
vulnerabilities and target organizations before they patch.
CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-27065. These
vulnerabilities, known as ProxyLogon, affect Microsoft Exchange email servers.
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities in combination (i.e., “vulnerability
chaining”) allows an unauthenticated cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable Exchange Servers, which, in turn, enables the actor to gain persistent
access to files and mailboxes on the servers, as well as to credentials stored on the
servers. Successful exploitation may additionally enable the cyber actor to compromise
trust and identity in a vulnerable network.
CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31207. These vulnerabilities, known
as ProxyShell, also affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. Successful exploitation of
these vulnerabilities in combination enables a remote actor to execute arbitrary code.
These vulnerabilities reside within the Microsoft Client Access Service (CAS), which
typically runs on port 443 in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) (e.g.,
Microsoft’s web server). CAS is commonly exposed to the internet to enable users to
access their email via mobile devices and web browsers.
CVE-2021-26084. This vulnerability, affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Data
Center, could enable an unauthenticated actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable
systems. This vulnerability quickly became one of the most routinely exploited
vulnerabilities after a POC was released within a week of its disclosure. Attempted
mass exploitation of this vulnerability was observed in September 2021.
Three of the top 15 routinely exploited vulnerabilities were also routinely exploited in 2020:
CVE-2020-1472, CVE-2018-13379, and CVE-2019-11510. Their continued exploitation
indicates that many organizations fail to patch software in a timely manner and remain
vulnerable to malicious cyber actors.

Mitigations
Vulnerability and Configuration Management

6/22

Update software, operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network assets
in a timely manner. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities, especially those
CVEs identified in this CSA, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for
remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment. For patch
information on CVEs identified in this CSA, refer to the appendix.
If a patch for a known exploited or critical vulnerability cannot be quickly applied,
implement vendor-approved workarounds.
Use a centralized patch management system.
Replace end-of-life software, i.e., software that is no longer supported by the vendor.
For example, Accellion FTA was retired in April 2021.
Organizations that are unable to perform rapid scanning and patching of internet-facing
systems should consider moving these services to mature, reputable cloud service
providers (CSPs) or other managed service providers (MSPs). Reputable MSPs can
patch applications—such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, and chat and other
employee collaboration tools—for their customers. However, as MSPs and CSPs
expand their client organization's attack surface and may introduce unanticipated risks,
organizations should proactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs to jointly
reduce that risk. For more information and guidance, see the following resources.
CISA Insights Risk Considerations for Managed Service Provider Customers
CISA Insights Mitigations and Hardening Guidance for MSPs and Small- and Midsized Businesses
ACSC advice on How to Manage Your Security When Engaging a Managed
Service Provider
Identity and Access Management
Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, without exception.
Enforce MFA on all VPN connections. If MFA is unavailable, require employees
engaging in remote work to use strong passwords.
Regularly review, validate, or remove privileged accounts (annually at a minimum).
Configure access control under the concept of least privilege principle.
Ensure software service accounts only provide necessary permissions (least
privilege) to perform intended functions (non-administrative privileges).
Note: see CISA Capacity Enhancement Guide – Implementing Strong Authentication and
ACSC guidance on Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication for more information on
hardening authentication systems.
Protective Controls and Architecture

7/22

Properly configure and secure internet-facing network devices, disable unused or
unnecessary network ports and protocols, encrypt network traffic, and disable unused
network services and devices.
Harden commonly exploited enterprise network services, including Link-Local
Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),
Common Internet File System (CIFS), Active Directory, and OpenLDAP.
Manage Windows Key Distribution Center (KDC) accounts (e.g., KRBTGT) to
minimize Golden Ticket attacks and Kerberoasting.
Strictly control the use of native scripting applications, such as command-line,
PowerShell, WinRM, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and
Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).
Segment networks to limit or block lateral movement by controlling access to
applications, devices, and databases. Use private virtual local area networks.
Continuously monitor the attack surface and investigate abnormal activity that may
indicate lateral movement of a threat actor or malware.
Use security tools, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security
information and event management (SIEM) tools. Consider using an information
technology asset management (ITAM) solution to ensure your EDR, SIEM,
vulnerability scanner etc., are reporting the same number of assets.
Monitor the environment for potentially unwanted programs.
Reduce third-party applications and unique system/application builds; provide
exceptions only if required to support business critical functions.
Implement application allowlisting.
