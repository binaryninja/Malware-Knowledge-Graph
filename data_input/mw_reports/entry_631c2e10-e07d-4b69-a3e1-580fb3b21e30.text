Schneider Electric Security Notification
Security Notification – EcoStruxure Triconex Tricon V3
14 December 2017 Updated 14 December 2018

Overview
In December 2018, Schneider Electric issued a security notification related to a directed incident
that affected a single customer’s Triconex Tricon safety shutdown system.
Schneider Electric has worked closely with the customer, independent cybersecurity
organizations and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security/ICS-CERT to investigate and
mitigate the risks of this type of attack. It is important to note that the legacy Tricon system
responded appropriately, taking the plant to a safe state as designed. No harm was incurred by
the customer or the environment.
During our extensive investigation, Schneider Electric identified a vulnerability in the Tricon
firmware, which is limited to a small number of older versions of the Tricon. This vulnerability
was a part of a complex malware infection scenario. To date, the information gathered indicates
that if the Tricon key switch had been left in the correct position per our recommended
guidelines, the injection of malware would not have been successful.
____________________________________________________________________________
Through the recently enhanced Tricon CX controller, version 11.4, Schneider Electric has
mitigated the risks of these type of malware incidents. The company has also released a
process to detect the malware’s presence in a Tricon controller and a procedure to remove the
malware if discovered. As of February 1, 2019, Schneider Electric will require customers to
have a support contract in place to engage with this malware analysis service. For more
information, please contact your Global Customer Support Representative.
____________________________________________________________________________
Schneider Electric continues to recommend customers always implement the instructions
contained in the “Security Considerations” section in the Triconex documentation (i.e., Planning
and Installation Guides and TriStation 1131 Developers Guide).

Schneider Electric Security Notification
Schneider Electric strongly recommends users upgrade to the latest Triconex Tricon CX
version. Released in October 2018, Tricon CX v11.4 is compliant with the IEC 62443
cybersecurity standard and includes multiple security enhancements that meet the challenges
posed by the Triton/Hatman malware techniques and other sophisticated methods of attack.

Vulnerability Details
The malware requires unrestricted access to the safety network via remote network or physical
access. Additionally, the malware requires the Tricon key switch to be in the “PROGRAM”
mode to successfully deploy its payload.
The malware has the capability to scan and map the industrial control system to provide
reconnaissance and issue commands to Tricon controllers. Once deployed, this type of
malware, known as a Remotely Accessible Trojan (RAT), controls a system via a remote
network connection as if by physical access.

Detection and Mitigation
Triconex customers should contact their local Schneider Electric office for assistance with a
procedure Schneider Electric has developed to detect the Hatman/Triton malware’s presence in
a Tricon controller and to remove the malware if discovered. Schneider Electric will fully assess
the security of each Tricon safety system installation, analyze for the presence of the malware
and remove it if necessary. For customers who prefer to do this on their own, Schneider Electric
has made the malware detection process instructions and support material available for
download via the Schneider Electric Process Automation customer support portal. Once the
analysis is complete, Triconex users will receive a report for each Tricon system analyzed
advising whether the malware was detected and the steps to take to remove it.
____________________________________________________________________________
As of February 1, 2019, Schneider Electric will require customers to have a support contract in
place to engage this malware detection, analysis and removal service. For more information,
please contact your Global Customer Support Representative

Additionally, Schneider Electric recommends customers always keep their antivirus tools up to
date and ensure they are using the latest antivirus .dat files on the engineering workstation
where the TriStation terminal is installed. Signatures for the malware have been distributed to
cybersecurity organizations. Schneider Electric has confirmed that major antivirus vendors now
include the malware file’s signatures and that if detected, the antivirus tool takes action.
Schneider Electric understands that all customers are not in a position for immediate upgrade to
our latest Tricon product with our latest security features. Because of this, Schneider Electric
continues to recommend customers always implement the instructions in the “Security

Considerations” section in the standard Triconex documentation (i.e., Planning and Installation
Guides and TriStation 1131 Developers Guide), which include the following:
• Ensure the cybersecurity features in Triconex solutions are always enabled.
• Safety systems must always be deployed on isolated networks.
• Physical controls should be in place so that no unauthorized person would have access to
the safety controllers, peripheral safety equipment or the safety network.
• All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the “PROGRAM” mode.
• All Tristation engineering workstations should be secured and never be connected to any
network other than the safety network.
• All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated safety network such as CDs, USB
drives, DVD’s, etc. should be scanned before use in the Tristation engineering workstations
or any node connected to this network.
• Laptops and PCs should always be properly verified to be virus and malware free before
connection to the safety network or any Triconex controller.
• Operator stations should be configured to display an alarm whenever the Tricon key switch is
in the “PROGRAM” mode.
Cyber Preparedness:
• Also, review and assess your site’s cyber preparedness. Schneider Electric is a proponent of
the NIST Cyber Security Framework and is ready to assist.
• The Schneider Electric Product Security Office continues to work with ICS-CERT and will
update this advisory as more information becomes available.
• Always refer to the Global Customer Support website for the latest list of Triconex security
recommendations, or contact your local Triconex representative.
