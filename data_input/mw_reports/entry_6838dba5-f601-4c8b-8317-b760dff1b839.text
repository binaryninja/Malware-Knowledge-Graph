Mercenary advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, sometimes called “hackers-for-hire” –
and dubbed private-sector offensive actors (PSOAs) by Microsoft – have become a
significant part of the threat landscape in recent years. These cyber-soldiers of fortune have
been executing increasing numbers of attack campaigns for their clients, usually nationstates, that are looking for surveillance capabilities. Not all countries have the technical
capability to launch their own attacks: many, however, have the financial resources to pay
someone who does.

Over the last decade, more than a dozen mercenary APT campaigns have been disclosed.
Many of these have been both highly sophisticated and highly persistent. Victims often
include politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers, and
dissidents from around the world. They frequently target end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)
applications, such as Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram, that are used to thwart traditional
government surveillance tactics. A growing number of these mercenary APT campaigns are
now also actively infiltrating and stealing intellectual property and other sensitive information
from enterprises.
These campaigns are supported by a significant market for 0day exploits and malware
developers. As such, nation-states that want to begin hacking campaigns no longer need the
technical expertise of years gone by: they just need to be well-resourced. Furthermore, even
though these APTs have existed for decades, the capabilities previously associated uniquely
with them are more accessible than ever before. And, in the case of nation-state APTs, it has
become easier to predict which companies and sectors are most likely to be attacked,
meaning defence has also been made, marginally, easier.
If the threat landscape is evolving in the way these mercenary groups suggest, however,
where anyone can hire mercenaries for a broad spectrum of intrusion campaigns, even this
minor advantage may have been lost.

Hackers For Hire – A Line-Up
In the following section, we will outline the pre-eminent mercenary APT groups that have
engaged in malicious activity over the past few years: CostaRicto, Bahamut, DarkBasin, and
DeathStalker. First, we explore the intriguing case of the DarkMatter espionage unit.
In September 2021, the US Department of Justice revealed that three former US intelligence
agency employees had been fined $1.69 million and barred from ever again receiving
security clearance. The employees violated US computer abuse laws by spying for the
government of the UAE. The three men admitted to selling sensitive military technology while
working for Project Raven: the codename for a secretive company, DarkMatter, that acted as
a clandestine spying unit for the UAE.
Project Raven leveraged computer network exploitation (CNE) to compromise the accounts
of human rights activists, journalists, and rival governments. Whilst engaged in Project
Raven, the three men reportedly targeted the US and exported spying software to a foreign
government without gaining the required permission from the US State Department’s
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC). As noted in a Reuters investigation, the three
men are former US National Security Agency (NSA) employees and worked for DarkMatter
in the UAE between January 2016 and November 2019. While working for DarkMatter, the
ex-NSA employees helped develop and deploy two iOS zero-click exploits called Karma and
Karma 2. These were reportedly used against iPhones belonging to dissidents, reporters,
and government opposition leaders. The US Department of Justice also noted that this

agreement was the first resolution of its kind for two types of criminal activity: providing
unlicensed export-controlled services in support of hacking campaigns; and a commercial
company supporting a foreign government to access networks and devices of computers
worldwide, including in Qatar, Yemen, and the US. [1, 2]
In November 2020, BlackBerry researchers disclosed a new mercenary APT, dubbed
CostaRicto. This group was targeting organisations around the world but predominantly in
South Asia – India, Bangladesh, and Singapore – Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The
victims were spread across several verticals, with many in the financial sector. It is unclear
where these hackers-for-hire are located. However, as they mainly focused on South Asian
targets, the researchers believe they are most likely to be based there. For many of its
campaigns, CostaRicto uses spear-phishing attacks to drop a custom backdoor, dubbed
SombRAT, that has rarely been seen in the wild. The code suggests there are multiple
versions, indicating the backdoor can be flexibly adapted for different attacks. The earliest
compilation timestamps for SombRAT date back to 2017. The group has also compromised
its targets via stolen credentials, reportedly purchased on the darknet. [1, 2]
Active since 2016, a mercenary APT known as Bahamut (connected to WindShift) has
launched multiple highly targeted ongoing campaigns against Android users in the Middle
East. Individuals targeted by the group have usually been human rights activists, military
officers, members of royal families, diplomats, religious leaders, and business executives.
Bahamut’s targets have also been located in other parts of the globe, such as the US. The
group usually uses malicious mobile applications distributed via legitimate application stores,
masquerading as fitness trackers or password managers. Once downloaded by a victim, an
array of personal information is extracted which can then be used for a wide spectrum of
malicious activities, with potentially serious implications. [1, 2, 3]
In June 2020, researchers from Citizen Lab disclosed that thousands of individuals and
hundreds of institutions had been targeted by a mercenary group known as DarkBasin.
Targets included advocacy groups, journalists, and senior government officials, as well as
hedge funds and other organisations from various sectors. The group mainly targeted
American non-profits, especially those working on a campaign operating under the hashtag
#ExxonKnew, which claims ExxonMobil hid information concerning climate change for
decades. DarkBasin was also linked to phishing campaigns targeting net-neutrality
advocates. Further investigation into the group uncovered several ties to an Indian
cybersecurity company, called BellTroX InfoTech Services, which subsequently disappeared
once the investigation was made public. Analysis of DarkBasin’s phishing infrastructure,
which used a custom URL shortener, revealed 28,000 additional URLs containing emails of
targets. [1, 2]
In August 2020, Kaspersky researchers disclosed an unusual Russian-speaking mercenary
APT group called DeathStalker (originally named Deceptikons). Unlike the other groups
mentioned above, DeathStalker primarily focuses on law firms and financial institutions.
These threat actors are reportedly tasked with gathering sensitive business information in
3/8

what are believed to be corporate espionage campaigns. DeathStalker uses custom malware
distributed in highly targeted spear-phishing emails. For C&C communication, the malware
uses “dead drop” resolvers: using safe websites, such as GitHub, Facebook, YouTube,
Reddit, and Twitter, to host the locations of C&C servers. This means the communication is
camouflaged amongst legitimate traffic, in much the same way as spies use a dead drop to
pass messages undercover. DeathStalker’s victims are spread around the world in countries
such as the UK, Switzerland, the UAE, India, China, Taiwan, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan,
Cyprus, Argentina, and Turkey. [1, 2]

Hacking-as-a-Service
While Mercenary APTs carry out their criminal activity with no action needed on their clients’
behalf, there are also a growing number of licensed companies selling offensive software
that can be bought and deployed by anyone with malicious intent. Intelligence agencies, law
enforcement, and military units around the world are increasingly acquiring these off-theshelf hacking software, buying exploits for 0day vulnerabilities, and paying others to develop
spying tools.

The standard defence of ethically dubious products is that their software is used to fight
terrorism and organised crime. More often than not, however, their products end up being
used to target human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, activists, and dissidents.
FinFisher, also known as FinSpy, is a surveillance software created and distributed by
Gamma International. The company was breached in 2014 by an individual working under
the moniker Phineas Fisher, who stole and leaked an archive containing 40GB of data from
Gamma International servers. This information included price lists, source code, invoices,
and other private data able to link the purchase of spyware to specific clients.
Another company that was hacked by Phineas Fisher was Hacking Team, which suffered a
much more serious attack than Gamma International and went out of business. The attack
on HackingTeam left a gap in the market, from mid-2015 onwards, for surveillance tools. This
was filled by Gamma International with its FinFisher spyware suite. Although Gamma
International was breached by the same individual, the incident was not as serious and the
spyware firm was able to recover, operating in the vacuum left by HackingTeam. The
Phineas Fisher leaks unveiled what many suspected about these commercial spyware
developers: they were knowingly selling surveillance tools to authoritarian regimes who used
them to spy on civilians. [1, 2, 3]

In July, Microsoft released new information regarding a private-sector offensive actor (PSOA)
it tracks as Sourgum, which reportedly belongs to an Israel-based company called Candiru.
The organisation has targeted over 100 victims around the world, including politicians,
human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers, and political dissidents with
a malware family called DevilsTongue. Approximately half of the victims were found in the
Palestinian Authority, with others in Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain (specifically
Catalonia), the UK, Turkey, Armenia, and Singapore. It should be noted that the identification
of victims of the malware in a country is not indicative that an agency in that country is a
Candiru customer, as international targeting is common. Nonetheless, this is not proof that
the country in question is not a Candiru customer, either.
Candiru uses a chain of vulnerabilities in web browsers and Windows to install its
DevilsTongue modular multi-threaded backdoor. This custom malware is written and can
steal credentials from web browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox. It also decrypts and
exfiltrates conversations from Signal, the E2EE messaging app. The attacks begin with a
single-use URL that is sent via messaging applications, such as WhatsApp. These threat
actors have also weaponised Windows 0day vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2021-31979 and
CVE-2021-33771, to support delivery. Successful exploitation led to privilege escalation,
giving an attacker the ability to escape browser sandboxes and gain kernel code execution.
Spy agencies in Uzbekistan, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia are among the list of Candiru’s
alleged previous customers. [1, 2]
In August, CitizenLab revealed that the infamous NSO Group, an Israeli spyware developer,
had once again been implicated in an unethical surveillance campaign. The latest Pegasus
spyware campaign targeted at least nine Bahraini activists, a French Lawyer, and an Indian
journalist via a new iOS exploit, dubbed FORCEDENTRY. This was a highly sophisticated
zero-click, 0day vulnerability in iMessage, meaning it could be triggered without the intended
victim either viewing the message sent by the threat actors or clicking the link contained in
the message.
The NSO Group, however, allegedly does not carry out hacking itself: the most recent
campaign having been orchestrated by a Pegasus customer and operator, dubbed LULU,
linked to the government of Bahrain. The technically impressive part of the FORCEDENTRY
exploit is that it could bypass BlastDoor, which Apple recently developed to protect from such
attacks. It places parts of iMessage inside a sandbox to isolate malicious code from
interacting with the underlying operating system (OS). Interestingly, four of the victims’ phone
numbers were present in the list of 50,000 potential Pegasus targets obtained by Forbidden
Stories and Amnesty International in July. The leaked phone numbers belong to hundreds of
business executives, religious figures, academics, NGO employees, union officials, and
government officials. Also shown in the leak are NSO Group clients from at least 11
countries, including Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco,
Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Togo, and the UAE. [1, 2]

A Mercenary Future
Mercenary APTs, malicious software developers, and 0day brokers significantly lower the
barrier to entry for launching advanced hacking campaigns. Technical expertise and a small
army of highly skilled individuals are no longer required to perform such attacks. Now, all that
is needed, are resources: of which many nation-states have a lot. The previously technically

7/8

impossible is made available through 0day exploits worth millions of dollars on underground
markets. Mercenary APTs develop bespoke malware tooling, manage their own
infrastructure, perform their own reconnaissance, and execute all phases of the intrusion.
This is the effective outsourcing of many of the most nefarious parts of the playbook for
despotic regimes.
A mercenary APT’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often resemble highly
sophisticated state-sponsored campaigns, but the profiles and geography of their victims are
far too diverse to be aligned with one state’s interests. Therefore, these cybercriminals must
carefully choose their targets to avoid the risk of being exposed and having their operations
shut down: consequently, many go undetected for several years. Even notorious
adversaries, experienced in cyber-espionage, can benefit from adding a layer of obfuscation
to their campaigns. By using a mercenary group as a proxy, therefore, the real attacker can
better protect their identity and frustrate attempts at attribution by the cybersecurity
community.
Defending against these powerful and disaggregated threats, however, can lead to a sort of
“security nihilism”, wherein it seems that nothing can be done to prevent these sophisticated
attacks. We content that this conclusion, however, is incorrect. The majority of these attacks
rely on victims making simple mistakes, such as clicking on a link, opening a document, or
leaving devices unpatched. As such, by practising proper security awareness, using
password managers and multi-factor authentication, keeping devices and applications
updated, and investing in security software, attackers’ campaigns will be frustrated to the
point that they will eventually move on to softer targets.
