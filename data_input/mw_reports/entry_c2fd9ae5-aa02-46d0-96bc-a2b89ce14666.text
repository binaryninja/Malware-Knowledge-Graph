This report details a campaign conducted by a China-linked threat activity
group, RedEcho, targeting the Indian power sector. The activity was identified
through a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and
expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded Future Platform,
SecurityTrails, Spur, Farsight, and common open-source tools and techniques.
The report will be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic and
operational intelligence relating to Indian and Chinese activity in cyberspace.
Recorded Future notified the appropriate Indian government departments prior
to publication of the suspected intrusions to support incident response and
remediation investigations within the impacted organizations.

Executive Summary
Relations between India and China have deteriorated significantly following
border clashes in May 2020 that resulted in the first combat deaths in 45 years
between the world’s two most populous nations. As a result, on January 12,
2021, India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar announced that trust

between India and China was “profoundly disturbed.” While diplomacy and
economic factors have been effective in preventing a full-blown war, notable
most recently with the bilateral disengagement at the border, cyber operations
continue to provide countries with a potent asymmetric capability to conduct
espionage or pre-position within networks for potentially disruptive reasons.
Since early 2020, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group observed a large increase in
suspected targeted intrusion activity against Indian organizations from Chinese
state-sponsored groups. From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded Future’s midpoint
collection revealed a steep rise in the use of infrastructure tracked as
AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, which encompasses ShadowPad command and
control (C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India’s power sector. 10 distinct
Indian power sector organizations, including 4 of the 5 Regional Load Despatch
Centres (RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing
electricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted
campaign against India’s critical infrastructure. Other targets identified included
2 Indian seaports.
Using a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure detections, domain
analysis, and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined
that a subset of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers share some common
infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with several
previously reported Chinese state-sponsored groups, including APT41 and
Tonto Team.
Despite some overlaps with previous groups, Insikt Group does not currently
believe there is enough evidence to firmly attribute the activity in this particular
campaign to an existing public group and therefore continue to track it as a
closely related but distinct activity group, RedEcho.

Key Judgements
The targeting of Indian critical infrastructure offers limited economic
espionage opportunities; however, we assess they pose significant
concerns over potential pre-positioning of network access to support
Chinese strategic objectives.
Pre-positioning on energy assets may support several potential
outcomes, including geo-strategic signaling during heightened bilateral
tensions, supporting influence operations, or as a precursor to kinetic
escalation.
RedEcho has strong infrastructure and victimology overlaps with Chinese
groups APT41/Barium and Tonto Team, while ShadowPad is used by at
least 5 distinct Chinese groups.

2/3

The high concentration of IPs resolving to Indian critical infrastructure
entities communicating over several months with a distinct subset of
AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers used by RedEcho indicate a targeted
campaign, with little evidence of wider targeting in Recorded Future’s
network telemetry.
