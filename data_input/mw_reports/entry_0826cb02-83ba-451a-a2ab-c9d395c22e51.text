Brief History
These infection chains began from IOCs collected by Zain Gardezi over at FireEye. You can
read the report HERE. The report contained a lot of IOCs, but the one that I want to
highlight is the IP address 173.208.245.114. I was interested in this IP because the host
using it was acting as a shadow server, hosting numerous domains that were redirecting
victims to Sundown EK.
Some of the most recent domains resolving to that IP address include maddow.club and
sayvinatge.club. Using those two domains as my referers proved to be successful as my host
was redirected to RIG exploit kit numerous times. I don‚Äôt have time to go over each infection
chain, but they are all similar. So, one example should do just fine.

Infection Chain
The infection chain I‚Äôm using as my example is from the Third Run. The infection begins
when I visited sayvinatge.club. Below is the GET request for the domain and the web servers
response:

1/22

The server responds with a ‚Äú302 Found‚Äù and gives the new location of
freeonlinecoupons.ml/go.php.
My host then makes a GET request for the go.php hosted at freeonlinecoupons.ml:

Again, we see a web server respond with another ‚Äú302 Found‚Äù with the new location being
that of a RIG exploit kit landing page at temp.askthevendor.com:

The browser loads the landing page and it is visible to the user (it usually happens out of the
users view):

2/22

Below is an image of the traffic from the Third Run:

We then see the Flash exploit being sent to the host which is eventually followed by the
malware payload: ask33u6p.exe (Smoke Loader). The script responsible for downloading the
payload is o32.tmp, which is dropped and executed in %TEMP%.
Later on in the infection we see Smoke Loader generate GET requests for additional
malware: s927397.exe (aka 1D95.tmp.exe) which appears to be an updated version of
Smoke Loader and smoke927397.exe (aka 4CC4.tmp.exe) which turns out to be Neutrino
Bot. There is an excellent article written by Hasherezade and J√©r√¥me Segura about Neutrino
Bot on the MalwareBytes Lab blog which you can read HERE.
Here is an image of my %TEMP% folder after many hours of letting my computer site idle:

3/22

If Neutrino bot detects that it is in a VM it deletes itself. It it passes checks then it copies itself
to %APPDATA%:

The folder alFSVWJB is hidden from the my view

4/22

However, the folder and the malware are hidden from my view. That being said, I can see
from the running processes (gjhax_16.exe) and the location of the file that the malware
copied itself to %APPDATA% in a folder called alFSVWJB
(C:Users[Username]AppDataRoamingalFSVWJBgjhax_16.exe):

You can also verify that the malware copied itself to %APPDATA% by looking at HKCU Run
and HKLM Run:

5/22

The malware remains hidden by modifying the following registry keys:
HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionExplorerAdvancedHidden
HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionExplorerAdvancedShowSuperHidden

Here are more entries as well as a base64 encoded value containing C2 information:

6/22

You‚Äôll notice that the value in ‚Äúa‚Äù (HKCUSoftwarealFSVWJB) contains the base64 encoded
string ‚ÄúaHR0cDovL251dHN5c3RlbTEuYml0L25ld2ZpejIxL2xvZ291dC5waHA=‚Äù. This string
decodes to ‚Äúhxxp://nutsystem1.bit/newfiz21/logout.php‚Äù.
The malware also added itself into the firewall‚Äôs whitelist via the command:
cmd.exe " /a /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="alFSVWJB" dir=in
action=allow program=%APPDATA%alFSVWJBgjhax_16.exe"

An example of this can be seen in the process tree below:

Processes showing command

Following these events we see the Neutrino bot beacon out the word ‚Äúenter‚Äù to
nutsystem1.bit/newfiz21/logout.php and the response from the server is ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù (‚Äúenter‚Äù
and ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù are base64 encoded)

7/22

ZW50ZXI = enter and c3VjY2Vzcw = success

Following the response we see another POST request
to nutsystem1.bit/newfiz21/logout.php:

The malware collects information about the host via some base64 encoded data:
cmd&10bbd51x-660x-467x-9dax-04c078c4210x&WIN-U2ULJPT1QBB&Windows%207%20(64bit)&1&N%2FA&5.2&01.04.2017&12042016ao

More base64 encoded data is in the response:

8/22

The base64 encoded data in the response decodes to:

hxxp://178.159.36.43/161927400.exe#

This prompts my host to download additional malware from 178.159.36.43:

9/22

Host downloads additional files from locations retrieved by the C2

This is the part that threw me for a bit of a loop. You‚Äôll notice a lot of POST requests to
Omegle.com and its various subdomains. I had no idea what Omegle.com was but
apparently it‚Äôs a website that allows users to connect to various servers and talk to random
strangers. Looking at the POST requests we can see the following pattern:
1. front3.omegle.com/start?rcs=1&firstevents=1&spid=&randid=UMKDFYRE&lang=en
2. front3.omegle.com/events
3. front3.omegle.com/send
4. front3.omegle.com/disconnect
It repeats this pattern over and over again, each time switching between subdomains
‚Äúfront1.omegle.com‚Äù through ‚Äúfront15.omegle.com.‚Äù What is it doing exactly? Well, it is
connecting to the servers via /start?
rcs=1&firstevents=1&spid=&randid=UMKDFYRE&lang=en and then sends messages to the
strangers using POST /send. Once it is done spamming the message it disconnects from the
server via POST /disconnect and moves to the next one.
10/22

The message being spammed on Omegle.com servers is as follows:
hi
wassup? girl here with picturesz
i'm soo bored. just kik me at:
[random kik username]
this is my kik user-name, im gunna wait for ya ;)

And here is the message shown on Omegle.com:

Here is a TCP stream showing the messages being sent to Omegle.com:

msg = hey

11/22

msg = friendly girl here. i love dogs

üòâ

msg = want to be my friend on kik?

msg = LynrDowdle

12/22

msg = here is my kik User ,Name. im going to be on right now

üòâ

I‚Äôm also seeing traffic to Instagram:

Maybe the bot is simply trying to drive traffic to paying customers? If anyone knows for sure
you can contact me via Twitter. All the files should be available for download via the HybridAnalysis reports in the IOCs section.
