tr1adx Intelligence Bulletin (TIB) 00001: Bear Hunting Season: Tracking APT28
[December 28, 2016]
Summary
Our APT28 (a.k.a. Fancy Bear, Sofacy) friends in the Russian Federation have been busy once again. Not only
have they been busy staying in the spotlight with recent news coverage around the DNC breach and tracking of
Ukrainian Field Artillery Units, but also with registering plenty of domains at a pace akin to those mileage runs folks
do before year end to re-qualify for airline status.
Investigations we have conducted show recent campaigns focused on a plethora of targets in various countries
and/or regions, including:
Armenia
Turkey
Lithuania
Belarus
Malaysia
Middle East
Ukraine
Slovakia
Kazahstan
Spain
United Kingdom
Argentina
Japan
Hong Kong
India
Taiwan
Ghana
European Union Institutions
NATO Affiliated Targets
Targets include:
Military
Defense Industry
Government
Non Governmental Organizations (NGO's)
Advocacy Groups
Law Enforcement
Law Firms and Legal Services
Journalism / News Organizations
Particular individuals / persons of interest
Oil & Gas Industry

Analysis
TTP's associated with this Threat Actor allow us to track APT28's activities with a high/moderate degree of
confidence, and follow their trail of breadcrumbs. From an overall TTP perspective, not much has changed; APT28
is a huge fan of registering domain names that appear to be legitimate and/or associated with their targets. APT28
will then leverage spear phishing or other methods to entice their targets to visit web sites hosted on these domains
in an attempt to harvest credentials, or other desired information. Subsequently, the Threat Actor will generally
install Sofacy, Agent-X malware for persistence and command & control of the acquired targets.
While the majority of TTP's (tradecraft) related to APT28 have not changed, we did discover two separate
instances where registered domains were specifically tailored to target particular individuals / persons of interest,
down to the level of showing what seem to be copies of passport photographs of these individuals in what appears
to be an attempt to legitimize the infrastructure associated with the campaign. Furthermore, investigation of
configuration files associated with these campaigns concluded that the Threat Actor had already gathered valid
credentials of the user, which were hard coded into the mock application. It appears extortion may be an intended
effect of this particular piece of the campaign; as such we have made a conscious decision not to publicize any
Indicators of Compromise associated with the extortion elements.
