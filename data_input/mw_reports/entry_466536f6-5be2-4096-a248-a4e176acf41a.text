What the Pack(er)?

March 23, 2022

Lately, I broke one of the taboos of malware analysis: looking into the packer stub of a
couple of malware samples. Fortunately, I must say. Because I discovered something I was
really surprised by. But first, a little detour.
Historically, Emotet has been observed to assemble infected systems into three botnets
dubbed Epoch 1, Epoch 2, and Epoch 3. After the takedown and the later resurrection, there
seems to only be two botnets which have subsequently been dubbed Epoch 4 and Epoch 5.
The differences between the old and the new core of the botnets are significant on the
technical side – however, the old Epochs 1 through 3 shared the same core and so do the
recent Epoch 4 and Epoch 5. The only noticeable difference between Epochs 1 through 3
was the config which was embedded into the Emotet core before a sample was rolled out to
the victims. The same also applies to the more recent Epochs 4 and 5.
However, there is a significant difference in the operation carried out by the botnets between
what happened before the disruption and what was observed since the rebirth. In the past,
observations showed that Emotet bots used to drop whatever their operator’s customers paid
them for. Brad Duncan alone already observed Emotet dropping QakBot/QBot, Trickbot, and
Gootkit. Of these, the Trickbot group seemed to be their best and longest-running customer
based on the numerous observations of Trickbot being dropped by Emotet. But after the
resurrection, there were no longer observations of additional malware being dropped by
Emotet. Instead, starting in December 2021, researchers observed a CobaltStrike beacon
being dropped onto an infected machine without any evidence that there was another
malware involved. Emotet has since been reportedly and repeatedly seen to deploy
CobaltStrike beacons to infected machines, so this was definitely not a one-off drop and
drew the attention of our researchers.
With the context of this analysis being setup properly, we can finally come back to the actual
topic of this blog post: breaking taboos by analyzing packing stubs. Enjoy!

Poking (in) Packing Stubs
For the first period of time after the resurrection, the Emotet core seems to have used XOR
encryption to hide their bot from static analysis. It can easily be seen that the algorithms
appear to be (almost) identical between Epoch 4 (left) and Epoch 5 (right) – disregarding a
few compiler optimizations due to different key lengths:

At some point, the authors changed the encryption scheme to use RC4 instead of plain XOR.
Although the code applying the RC4 algorithm looks different thanks to a substantial amount
of superfluous API calls, there are obvious similarities between Epoch 4 on the left and
Epoch 5 on the right:

The surprising discovery we made during the week preceeding the publication of this post is
related to the CobaltStrike drops. Assuming from what was observed for Epochs 1 through 3,
thoughts were that some other party paid the Emotet operators to drop CobaltStrike as their
desired payload. Having a closer look at the samples reveals an interesting observation: all
of the CobaltStrike drops used packing stubs which looked extremely familiar. The drops

referred to in the following were received on March 11th, however, these specific packing
stubs were already observed earlier for Emotet drops. Unfortunately, we did not see the
connection until a couple of days ago. But have a look for yourself:

for Payloads
As it can be seen in both examples, Drop A used the packer which was observed in the early
days after the rebirth while Drop B used the same packer as the Emotet core itself at the
time of writing this post.

Conclusion or (Educated) Guessing
Prior to the rebirth, drops were not bound to the operation of Emotet – the botnet was known
to drop whatever their operator’s customers paid them for; but since the resurrection, this
seems to have shifted towards drops which are very tightly-bound to the Emotet core and
thus the operation as well. Considering that Trickbot was used to revive the Emotet botnet
back in november 2021 and the observation that Emotet since then only dropped
CobaltStrike beacons to infected machines, one thought may arise: have the Trickbot
operators perhaps invited their old friends from Emotet over to work for the Conti group as
well? It has long been said that the Emotet operators are closely related to the Trickbot group
because of their long-running partnership. The thought is also supported by information from
the Conti playbook leak in 2021 where it can be seen that Conti makes heavy use of
CobaltStrike as a reconnaissance tools before deploying their ransomware. AdvIntel also
suspected that Emotet arose as part of the Conti group. The now-discovered use of identical
packers for both the Emotet core and the CobaltStrike drops supports the claim in a
fascinating way.

6/7

Alternatively, or additionally, the resurrection of Emotet may have been the final step in
replacing Trickbot as the initial foothold of the Conti group in their victim’s networks by
putting their remaining Trickbot bots to a last use. It cannot be denied that Emotet was a
surprisingly efficient malware so the Conti operators may have gone for using both Emotet
and BazarLoader to access their victim’s networks: with the Trickbot developers focusing
solely on BazarLoader and the Emotet operators back into the business, this leaves the
Conti group with two independent and powerful tools to access infected machines.

Remarks
Of course, at the same time the author made the aforementioned discovery, researchers
observed another drop being delivered by Emotet: SystemBC. It remains to be seen whether
this was a one-time delivery in the sense of a test or if researcher will see this drop more
often in the future.
