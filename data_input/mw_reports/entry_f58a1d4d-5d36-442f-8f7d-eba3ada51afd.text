LockBit 2.0: Ransomware Attacks Surge After Successful Affiliate Recruitment

Malware September 9, 2021

By Megan Roddie 7 min read
After a brief slowdown in activity from the LockBit ransomware gang following increased
attention from law enforcement, LockBit is back with a new affiliate program, improved
payloads and a change in infrastructure. According to IBM X-Force, a major spike in data
leak activity on the gang’s new website indicates that their recruitment attempts have been
successful. IBM’s data shows that LockBit is nearly six times more active than other groups,
such as the Conti ransomware operators. This blog post delves into LockBit’s 2.0 version, its
recent activity and an analysis of the new payloads.
LockBit is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) gang that writes and distributes its malware
through affiliates. RaaS has become an increasingly popular business model for ransomware
operators in the past few years, helping gangs expand their reach without growing their core
team or their expenses. These groups are able to make a profit while turning over the actual
deployment of their ransomware payloads to affiliates, who also shoulder part of the risk of
being exposed by law enforcement.

Announcing LockBit 2.0
The LockBit gang was first found advertising their affiliate program in January 2020 on a
well-known, Russian-speaking forum known as XSS. This underground forum has been used
by many RaaS gangs in the past to advertise their malware and hunt for new affiliates. That
includes gangs like REvil/Sodinokibi, DarkSide, Netwalker and others. But with increased
attention from law enforcement, XSS banned all ransomware topics from their forum in early
2021.
With this avenue shut down, LockBit’s owners pivoted to using their own infrastructure for
advertising. At the end of June 2021, those behind LockBit posted a page on their leak site
(bigblog[.]at) announcing recruitment for their LockBit 2.0 affiliate program.

According to their post, the affiliate is responsible for gaining access to “the core server”,
likely referring to a domain controller, and then the rest will be carried out by the LockBit
payload.
The group mentions their payload does not operate in Russian-language speaking countries
and specifies that they will only work with experienced penetration testers. Additionally, the
group claims their ransomware is faster than any other ransomware families and includes a
table for comparing supposed encryption speeds against other prolific ransomware codes.
The affiliate also gets to decide the ransom amount and will receive the payment directly,
sending the LockBit gang’s cut of the profit after the ransom is paid.

To facilitate extortion if a victim refuses to pay for a decryption key, LockBit also includes
access to an information stealer they call StealBit, which allegedly exfiltrates files from victim
networks to the LockBit blog. This malware is also touted as a high-speed uploader, which is
supposed to reassure affiliates that their operation will be swift.

X-Force researchers were able to identify files submitted to VirusTotal in August 2021 that
may be samples of the StealBit malware, but analysis is still ongoing at the time of this
publication.

A Spike in Victims’ Data Exposure
Prior to the announcement of LockBit 2.0’s affiliate program, the last dark web leak from the
gang appears to have been published on December 30, 2020. Posting activity resumed
approximately seven months later on July 21, 2021, shortly after new recruitment attempts
began, with about 76 new posts published within a six-day period.

Looking at other ransomware families’ leak sites in the three-week period since LockBit’s
return (7/21/2021-8/11/2021), LockBit appears to be currently operating one of the most
active ransomware leak sites.

Victims by Industry, Geography
With regards to victims, IBM X-Force identified the below industries and geographies being
impacted by LockBit and its affiliates:

While a few regions and industries have multiple victims involved, IBM was unable to identify
any clear targeting patterns. Each LockBit affiliate likely has its own choices of targeting,
which may be targeted or opportunistic.
Given the timing of the new affiliate program being advertised and the spike in activity, IBM
X-Force suspects that LockBit was able to recruit affiliates who had already begun
compromising networks.

New Infrastructure
LockBit’s use of a data leak site first appeared in September 2020. Their leak sites and
support sites (where victims can purchase a decryptor) are offered at both surface and dark
web addresses. Along with the observed uptick in activity, IBM researchers discovered the
use of newly registered infrastructure for these sites.
LockBit’s primary blog that publishes victim data and advertises its affiliate program is
currently being hosted on the clear web at bigblog[.]at. Whois information for this domain
indicates that LockBit registered the domain on July 6, 2021. Pivoting off the unique
registrant email reveals that their new clear web decryptor site, decoding[.]at, was also
registered on the same date.
IBM X-Force was able to uncover the domain locksupp[.]at, which was leveraging the same
name servers as decoding[.]at. Whois and nameserver history indicates that this domain was
in use around June 6, 2021, but it appears it was suspended by June 29, 2021. It is not
currently reachable and its purpose is unknown at this time.

New Samples
X-Force identified over a dozen new submissions of LockBit samples to VirusTotal occurring
since the launch of the LockBit 2.0 affiliate program. Analysis was performed on several of
these samples to determine any changes in these new variants.
Much of LockBit’s functionality remains the same in version 2.0, with a similar encryption
routine. A hybrid AES/RSA encryption approach is still used. The two minor updates are the
renaming of the registry key in which the RSA public session key is stored and the creation
of a file used as a mutex while files are being encrypted. Additionally, the registry run key
used for persistence is now a GUID-type string instead of an alpha-numeric string.
On top of these minor changes, two major additions were discovered: the addition of a new
deployment technique and the physical printing of ransom notes.

Active Directory Deployment

8/13

One of the most significant changes identified during the analysis was the implementation of
a novel technique for deployment. The payload has the capability to automatically deploy
itself to Microsoft Active Directory clients via Group Policy Objects (GPO). When executed
on an Active Directory Domain Controller, LockBit 2.0 creates several GPOs to carry out the
infection process. The Windows Defender configuration is altered to avoid detection. It
refreshes network shares, stops certain services and kills processes. The LockBit executable
is then copied into the client desktop directories and executed. PowerShell is used to apply
the new GPOs to all domain-joined hosts in a specified organization unit (OU).

Ransom Note
The following is an example of the ransom note left behind after files are encrypted:

Another interesting addition to the extortion techniques is a new LockBit functionality to
repeatedly print the ransom note to any printers connected to the victim host.

A Growing Threat to Watch For
LockBit does not appear to be slowing down, with regular leaks being published daily since
the launch of their 2.0 affiliate program. It is likely that the ransomware payload will also
continue to evolve and expand its capabilities. This ransomware group and the many others
currently operating in the threat landscape present a major threat to organizations in all
industries and geographies, except those in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
countries where most malware operators avoid attacking local organizations.
Organizations should prioritize protecting their networks and data from this threat or risk
joining the growing list of victims of RaaS affiliates. The following are a few actions
companies can take that can help mitigate risks and minimize damage:
Establish and drill an incident response team. Whether in-house or as a retained
service, the formation of an incident response team and drilling the most relevant
attack scenarios can make a big difference in attack outcomes and costs.

9/13

Establish and maintain offline backups. Ensure you have files safely stored from
attacker accessibility with read-only access. Also, consider the use of offsite/cold
storage solutions. The availability of backup files is a significant differentiator for
organizations that can help them recover from a ransomware attack.
Implement a strategy to prevent unauthorized data theft, especially as it applies to
uploading large amounts of data to legitimate cloud storage platforms that attackers
can abuse. Consider blocking outbound traffic to unapproved cloud hosting services.
Employ user and entity behavior analytics to identify potential security incidents. When
triggered, assume a breach has taken place. Audit, monitor and quickly act on
suspected abuse related to privileged accounts and groups.
Deploy multifactor authentication on all remote access points into an enterprise
network — with particular care given to secure or disable remote desktop protocol
(RDP) access. Multiple ransomware attacks have been known to exploit weak RDP
access to gain initial entry into a targeted network.
Use penetration testing to identify weak points in enterprise networks and
vulnerabilities that should be prioritized for patching. In particular, we recommend
implementing mitigations for CVE-2019-19781, which multiple threat actors have used
to gain initial entry into enterprises in 2020 and 2021 — including for ransomware
attacks.
Consider prioritizing the immediate remediation, as applicable, of the following
frequently exploited software vulnerabilities:
CVE-2019-2725
CVE-2020-2021
CVE-2020-5902
CVE-2018-8453
VPN-related CVEs
CVE-2019-11510
CVE-2019-11539
CVE-2018-13379
CVE-2019-18935
CVE-2021-22893
RDP

10/13

Restrict port access on TCP port 3389
Apply multifactor authentication to remote access logins
Remediate RDP vulnerabilities such as Windows RDP CVE-2019-0708
(BlueKeep)
CVE-2020-3427
CVE-2020-0610
CVE-2020-0609
Segment networks according to the data they host.
Encrypt the data most likely to be stolen in an attack.
Consider adopting a zero trust approach and framework to better control what users
can access and potentially halt an attack in its tracks.
