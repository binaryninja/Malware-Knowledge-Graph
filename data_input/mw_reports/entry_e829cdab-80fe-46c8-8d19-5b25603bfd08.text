Potential Legacy Risk from Malware Targeting QNAP NAS
Devices
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-209a

Summary
This is a joint alert from the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
CISA and NCSC are investigating a strain of malware known as QSnatch, which attackers
used in late 2019 to target Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices manufactured by the
firm QNAP.
All QNAP NAS devices are potentially vulnerable to QSnatch malware if not updated with the
latest security fixes. The malware, documented in open-source reports, has infected
thousands of devices worldwide with a particularly high number of infections in North
America and Europe. Further, once a device has been infected, attackers can prevent
administrators from successfully running firmware updates.
This alert summarizes the findings of CISA and NCSC analysis and provides mitigation
advice.

Technical Details
Campaigns
CISA and NCSC have identified two campaigns of activity for QSnatch malware. The first
campaign likely began in early 2014 and continued until mid-2017, while the second started
in late 2018 and was still active in late 2019. The two campaigns are distinguished by the
initial payload used as well as some differences in capabilities. This alert focuses on the
second campaign as it is the most recent threat.
It is important to note that infrastructure used by the malicious cyber actors in both
campaigns is not currently active, but the threat remains to unpatched devices.
Although the identities and objectives of the malicious cyber actors using QSnatch are
currently unknown, the malware is relatively sophisticated, and the cyber actors demonstrate
an awareness of operational security.

Global distribution of infections
Analysis shows a significant number of infected devices. In mid-June 2020, there were
approximately 62,000 infected devices worldwide; of these, approximately 7,600 were in the
United States and 3,900 were in the United Kingdom. Figure 1 below shows the location of
these devices in broad geographic terms.

Delivery and exploitation
The infection vector has not been identified, but QSnatch appears to be injected into the
device firmware during the infection stage, with the malicious code subsequently run within
the device, compromising it. The attacker then uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA)—
to establish a command and control (C2) channel that periodically generates multiple domain
names for use in C2 communications—using the following HTTP GET request:
HTTP GET https://[generated-address]/qnap_firmware.xml?=t[timestamp] [1]

Malware functionalities
Analysis shows that QSnatch malware contains multiple functionalities, such as:
CGI password logger
This installs a fake version of the device admin login page, logging successful
authentications and passing them to the legitimate login page.
Credential scraper

2/5

SSH backdoor
This allows the cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on a device.
Exfiltration
When run, QSnatch steals a predetermined list of files, which includes system
configurations and log files. These are encrypted with the actor’s public key and
sent to their infrastructure over HTTPS.
Webshell functionality for remote access

Persistence
The malware appears to gain persistence by preventing updates from installing on the
infected QNAP device. The attacker modifies the system host’s file, redirecting core domain
names used by the NAS to local out-of-date versions so updates can never be installed.

Samples
The following tables provide hashes of related QSnatch samples found in open-source
malware repositories. File types fall into two buckets: (1) shell scripts (see table 1) and (2)
shell script compiler (SHC)-compiled executable and linking format (ELF) shell scripts (see
table 2). One notable point is that some samples intentionally patch the infected QNAP for
Samba remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2017-7494.

Mitigations
As stated above, once a device has been infected, attackers have been known to make it
impossible for administrators to successfully run the needed firmware updates. This makes it
extremely important for organizations to ensure their devices have not been previously
compromised. Organizations that are still running a vulnerable version should take the
following steps to ensure the device is not left vulnerable:
Scan the device with the latest version of Malware Remover, available in QNAP
App Center, to detect and remove QSnatch or other malware.
If the installation via App Center fails, manually install Malware Remover following
this QNAP tutorial, or contact QNAP Technical Support for further assistance.
Run a full factory reset on the device.
Update the firmware to the latest version.
The usual checks to ensure that the latest updates are installed still apply. To prevent
reinfection, this recommendation also applies to devices previously infected with
QSnatch but from which the malware has been removed.
To prevent QSnatch malware infections, CISA and NCSC strongly recommend that
organizations take the recommended measures in QNAP’s November 2019 advisory.[2]
4/5

CISA and NCSC also recommend organizations consider the following mitigations:
Verify that you purchased QNAP devices from reputable sources.
If sources are in question then, in accordance with the instructions above, scan
the device with the latest version of the Malware Remover and run a full
factory reset on the device prior to completing the firmware upgrade. For
additional supply chain recommendations, see CISA’s tip on Securing Network
Infrastructure Devices.
Block external connections when the device is intended to be used strictly for internal
storage.
