Analyzing Network Infrastructure as Composite Objects
domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects

Introduction
Network infrastructure is one of the primary observables associated with cyber intrusions.
From IP addresses serving as scanning or reconnaissance infrastructure through domains
functioning as command and control (C2) or exfiltration servers, network infrastructure
forms a prerequisite for adversary operations. Viewed through typical models such as the
Lockheed-Martin Cyber Killchain, (shown below) network infrastructure observables factor
into nearly every stage of the intrusion lifecycle as either a critical dependency or an
enabling factor.

Yet while commonly referred to and almost universally present, network infrastructure
observables—specifically domain names and IP addresses—are also frequently derided as
atomic, minimally enriched items for defensive purposes. This paper will show that such a
view is mistaken and misguided—but only if we expand our understanding of network
infrastructure observables and their characteristics.
A thorough examination of network observables shows differentiation between minimally
enriched indicators and composite objects which enable more in-depth understanding and
analysis. By adopting the latter view, a seemingly atomic object such as a domain name
yields a number of linked observations, which enable further analysis and pivoting. By
following this methodology, defenders can use a relatively small set of observations to build
a robust picture of adversary tendencies and unearth additional campaigns and adversary
observations.

Indicators and Atomic Objects

2/15

Information security operations live through the ingestion, analysis, and disposition of
technical observations. Frequently called “indicators of compromise” (IOCs), these items
are in theory composite objects consisting of observations, descriptions, and metadata. Yet
in practice, “IOC” refers to a debased, diminished version of the original concept. Rather
than containing built-in contextuality, IOCs instead are reduced to mere observables in
isolation: an IP address, a domain name, a hash value.
While (debased) IOCs still drive much of everyday network security operations, they are
increasingly derided by analysts and industry representatives. Examples include calls to
emphasize adversary behaviors over specific technical observations for defense, or
theoretical constructs such as the Pyramid of Pain representing the “staying power” of
different types of observations.

While these arguments are generally correct and insightful for improving the practice of
information security, such developments come with an implicit and often ignored cost. In the
rush to embrace behavior-based, tactics-techniques-procedures (TTP) focused defense,
the value of indicators and their nature may be left behind.
A more thorough understanding of just what exists within an indicator allows us to explore in
greater detail the nature and basis for that indicator’s existence. Just as an atom, while
representing the fundamental building block of matter, contains subatomic particles that
define its characteristics, the same is true for bare indicators. With further analysis and
enrichment, we can discover greater details and gain an improved understanding of these
observations.

Nature of Network Infrastructure
3/15

Network infrastructure observables are those artifacts related to intrusion events or
adversary activity linked to delivery, communication, control, and exfiltration among other
items. Although not exhaustive, examples of network infrastructure observables include
domain names, IP addresses, and SSL/TLS certificates. As shown below, these items are
interrelated as they pertain to different aspects of the same overall communication scheme:
an IP hosts a domain that uses an SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt traffic.

At first glance, these items appear to be unitary, atomic indicators. As such, they would
appear to require enrichment and context outside of themselves to have lasting, meaningful
value for understanding adversary behaviors and tendencies. However, further investigation
of these items indicates a more complex nature with multiple subcomponents and
characteristics that identify these items, under proper analysis, as composite objects.
As shown in the updated image, infrastructure observables contain a wealth of data when
properly analyzed and observed. Extending the comparison to atoms made above, each
type of network observable effectively “breaks down” into a mixture of subcomponents.
Understanding and analyzing these items, their relationships, and patterns of composition
yields insights into adversary behaviors which extends and deepens the value of a “bare”
network indicator.

Domain Names
A domain name is a natural language, human-readable item designed as a reference to a
machine-focused IP address hosting content online. While content or services can be
accessed simply through an IP address, domains facilitate the process and allow for a
certain degree of “branding” or uniqueness through their name.
The domain itself is not a unitary object though. Rather, the domain consists of several
components or identifying metadata that can be used to “fingerprint” or gain further insight
into the domain’s nature or creation. In addition to any hosting information related to the
domain and its use, covered below, the following items represent characteristics of a
domain that analysts and defenders can leverage:
Domain Registrar: In order to create and take ownership of a domain, an individual
or entity needs to work through a registrar to secure a domain through one of the
registries managing the desired Top Level Domain (TLD - e.g., “.com”). Registrars
differ widely in terms of pricing, client scrutiny, and other aspects. As a result of these
characteristics and infrastructure preferences, threat actors may prefer or primarily
leverage certain registrars over others for infrastructure creation.
Domain Registrant: Domains are created by a given registrant. While this
information was historically quite useful, as such information would include contact
email addresses and other information that could be used to fingerprint infrastructure
creation, the increasing adoption of privacy protection services and the impact of the
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have greatly restricted
such information at present. Nonetheless, commonality in privacy protection services
across registrations can still be used as a weak link to tie together various domains.

5/15

Name Server: Domain resolution to an IP address requires an authoritative name
server in order to translate requests. Identifying name servers associated with
registration—especially specific authoritative servers—can reveal patterns of
infrastructure creation and adversary tendencies.
Domain Naming Theme or Convention: In one of my previous posts, I described
how actual domain name selection may be used to infer adversary intent as well as
adversary tendencies. Threat actors must pick something for a domain name, whether
this is a randomly-generated string, an item matching a theme, or a name matching a
target or campaign. Identifying these themes or conventions can be a surprisingly
useful mechanism to differentiate domain registrations and identify commonalities for
an actor.
The totality of these above items defines a domain. Just as they are components that
represent the domain, they are also items that can be used to search for similarly-structured
or created infrastructure. For example, an adversary may consistently use the same
combination of name server, registrar, and registration privacy protection service that can
enable pivoting and identification of additional adversary infrastructure.
As seen in the DomainTools Iris Investigate screenshot below, these items can be readily
identified and used for pivoting purposes.

IP Addresses
IP addresses are the identifying schema for Internet Protocol (IP) traffic and are used to
designate specific machines or servers to receive traffic. While domain names are not
necessary for network communication, IP addresses are required for IP-based
communication. An active, communicating domain will always be paired with an IP address,
while an IP address need not have a related domain to ensure communication between
hosts.
While IP addresses are one of the most commonly seen indicators in CTI reporting, just like
domains IP addresses hide multiple subcomponents that identify aspects of adversary
tendencies and behaviors:
Hosting Provider: Adversaries need to find reasonably private, non-attributable
hosting for network infrastructure. Options include any of the major cloud service
providers from Amazon Web Services to DigitalOcean; smaller virtual private server
(VPS) providers; or utilizing services such as CloudFlare to mask true hosting from
monitoring parties.
Hosting Location: In addition to hosting providers, threat actors also have a degree
of choice over hosting location. Cloud, VPS, and other providers typically own
infrastructure located in various countries. Adversaries can leverage location
specificity for purposes ranging from avoiding potential geographic-based traffic
filtering to taking advantage of the legal system of the hosting country to maximize
privacy or make defender investigations more difficult.
Server Type: Infrastructure still needs a system on which to run, and the choice of
operating system (OS) and version can also be used to fingerprint adversary
tendencies. Threat actors can decide between various flavors of Linux to different
versions of Windows for the underlying OS. Identifying particular tendencies—
especially when related to exposed system services, described below—can reveal
patterns of activity that can be used to identify or disposition new infrastructure.
Server Services: To function as a command and control (C2) or other node, a server
must listen on some service. The most direct and basic would be HTTP or HTTPS, in
which case we as defenders can identify the web server type, version, and, in the
case of HTTPS, server SSL/TLS certificates (described further below). Identifying
non-standard or atypical services, especially for unique or custom C2 frameworks,
can further enable identification and tracking.
To illustrate the above concepts, the suspicious domain “adverting-cdn[.]com” is hosted on
a dedicated server at 213.252.246[.]23. Within DomainTools Iris Investigate, we can identify
the IP address, hosting provider, and hosting location:

7/15

Using an internet scanning and enumeration tool such as Shodan, we can further
investigate the server to identify services and fingerprint the server’s OS:

Based on the above, we can identify a suspicious-looking domain hosted using a specific
service in Lithuania, exposing HTTP and SSH as well as HTTP over TCP 8000, and
allowing us to fingerprint the server as a Debian Linux machine. Using this information, we
could work to identify further infrastructure through both domain and server characteristics.

SSL/TLS Certificates
Finally, adversaries (as well as most legitimate web services) frequently employ standard
encryption using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS)
protocols. While adversaries can certainly use custom encryption or encoding protocols for
traffic, the ubiquity of SSL/TLS-wrapped communications and the limited visibility into such
communications for most organizations make the publicly-available standard both very
effective and significantly cheap for threat actors to deploy.
8/15

As a form of public key cryptography, SSL/TLS encryption depends upon certificates for
functionality. Certificates can be tracked through various data points, as they typically
feature identifying information related to the certificate owner, such as organization or
location.
Certificates can take a variety of forms from self-signed, untrusted items to certificates
created through free and unvetted services (such as Let’s Encrypt) or sources which
perform some degree of vetting when issuing them. While resulting metadata will vary
depending on the issuer and the certificate, there is a rich history in using certificate
characteristics to track adversary behavior, such as legacy APT28 or Fancy Bear certificate
and infrastructure activity.
Looking at the suspicious domain european-who[.]com, we discover a free certificate
associated with cPanel services. As such, there is limited data to pivot off of although we
can note the limited certificate information and use of a free service to identify this as
potentially suspicious, while the certificate hash value provides a way to track the use of this
specific item.

Even though in this case we have limited information for direct pivoting, just identifying the
use of self-signed, built-in cPanel certificates can be used to differentiate and identify further
infrastructure discovered through domain- or IP-based analysis. Identifying another network
9/15

object with similar domain or IP characteristics that also deploys similar SSL/TLS certificate
creation tendencies can allow us to link infrastructure and begin understanding adversary
behaviors.

Composite Details and Pivoting
In addition to pivoting within different types of infrastructure characteristics, as shown in the
diagram below, understanding of adversary infrastructure tendencies enables pivoting
between items as well.

In this view, insight into domain creation can reveal infrastructure hosting tendencies, which
can be leveraged to identify additional domains. Or a persistent pattern in SSL/TLS
certificate creation yields additional domains which in turn map to additional infrastructure.
However, while the discovery of new indicators is enticing and potentially useful for defense,
this represents an intermediate objective as part of a larger process. Instead of merely
attempting to identify more IOCs, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysts should leverage
this work as a means to identify fundamental adversary tendencies which can be used to
continuously identify and disclose infrastructure over time. Indicators will certainly be
produced through this work, but they represent an output of a more fundamental process of
identifying and observing ground-truth adversary behaviors in creating network
infrastructure.

Example: Late 2020 Ryuk Activity
To see an example of the above, we can look at the recent episode of Ryuk ransomware
incidents across multiple hospital and health care provider systems in the United States,
linked to a group referred to as UNC1878 by information security company FireEye. While
utilizing malware and droppers such as BazarLoader and BazarBackdoor, Ryuk deployers
still required C2 infrastructure to control and further expand infections in victim

10/15

environments. Based on information released by FireEye and Kyle Ehmke from
ThreatConnect, and confirmed by multiple additional parties, the UNC1878 network
infrastructure activity encompassed several hundred domains created from summer 2020
through October 2020. (Please see the linked file for IOCs.)
While seemingly overwhelming, the above domains contained a number of commonalities:
1. Similar registration patterns used over time.
2. Preference for a limited number of hosting providers.
3. Consistency in SSL/TLS certificate characteristics.
For example UNC1878-linked domain “drive-boost[.]com” features the following
characteristics:

Breaking these observables down, we see the following:
Use of consistent naming “theme” reflecting IT-related concepts or items (e.g.,
“driver”).
11/15

Use of the Namecheap registrar.
Consistent use of WhoisGuard privacy protection service.
Consistent use of registrar-servers[.]com DNS server.

While the above items individually are quite common, taken together they allow us to begin
filtering likely related items. Looking at hosting ISP patterns, shown above in a DomainTools
Iris Investigate visualization, reveals additional characteristics—namely four distinct “waves”
or series of activity centered around the following providers:
Private Layer Inc., located in Switzerland.
Psychz Networks, located in the United States.
Frantech Solutions, located in the United States.
Combahton GmbH, located in Germany.

12/15

Now we have a better way of clustering known activity, and potentially identifying new,
similar items. But even further options exist within a subset of domains that feature an
existing SSL/TLS certificate. For example, looking at “driver-boosters[.]com” shows the
following certificate information:

In this case, we see a certificate pattern using a Locality Name of “Texas” and an
Organization Name of “lol” for a self-signed certificate. Diving into certificate information
yields over 100 items which, when looked at in conjunction with other items documented
above, allows for high confidence attribution to UNC1878 activity.
Through this process, we have identified a set of characteristics denoting UNC1878
infrastructure. This can be used both for post-incident attribution to determine what entity
may be responsible for a breach. Additionally, such methodologies can be used through
datasets such as DomainTools and search tools such as Iris Investigate to proactively and

13/15

preemptively identify infrastructure as it is created. In this fashion, CTI becomes more
attuned to adversary tendencies and characteristics while also enabling more direct,
proactive support to network defense operations through continuous identification of
adversary infrastructure.

Conclusion
While network infrastructure indicators and observables are typically viewed as atomic
objects, seeing these items as composites enables powerful analysis able to keep pace
with adversary evolution. By understanding the fundamental nature of items such as
domain names, IP addresses, and SSL/TLS certificates, analysts can begin understanding
fundamental adversary tendencies and tradecraft. When done well, such actions enable
defenders to not only accurately disposition new infrastructure as it is discovered, but also
to identify new infrastructure as it is created to boost defensive operations.

While this process can be quite powerful in identifying and tracking adversary operations,
we must also note limitations to this methodology. For example, adversaries may leverage
compromised, legitimate infrastructure for communications and similar activity in order to
hide their tracks and confuse analysis. This is an increasing trend for many threat actors,
which can throw off analytical techniques such as those described above. However, even in

14/15

these cases, possibilities exist such as identifying underlying server or software
commonalities which may be indicative of a vulnerability exploited to gain access to the
legitimate server. These commonalities can enable similar types of pivoting to what was
discussed previously with respect to adversary-owned-and-operated infrastructure.
By viewing indicators as not just isolated objects but as composites containing multiple
components that can be used to better understand the nature, purpose, and composition of
the indicator, CTI analysts can unlock a greater understanding of adversary operations.
Furthermore, while this article is limited to network observables, the same fundamental
concepts are equally applicable to host and file-based indicators as well. By further refining,
researching, and enriching indicators, CTI analysts can continuously push the envelope of
threat understanding and threat detection, enabling both a better understanding of past
events and potential identification of new threat vectors from known adversaries as they
emerge.
