UPDATE: This blog post was updated on August 12, 2021 at the request of a third party.
Executive summary
In late May, Air India reported a massive passenger data breach. The announcement was
preceded by data breaches in various airline companies, including Singapore Airlines and
Malaysia Airlines. According to the public source data, these airlines use services of the
same IT service provider. The media suggested the airline industry was facing "a coordinated
supply chain attack". Air India was the first carrier to reveal more details about its security
breach.
The data revealed by Air India suggested that the massive data breach that affected multiple
carriers was a result of the compromise of the airline's IT service provider. That
announcement prompted Group-IBThreat Intelligence analysts to look closer at the attack.
Using its external threat hunting tools, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team then discovered
and attributed another previously unknown cyberattack on Air India with moderate
confidence to the Chinese nation-state threat actor known as APT41. The campaign was
codenamed ColunmTK.
In this blog post you will find:

Previously unknown details about the ColunmTK campaign
Evidence of compromised workstations and exfiltration of 200 MB of data from Air
India's network
Descriptions of TTPs used during the ColunmTK campaign
Connections between APT41 and the infrastructure used during the ColunmTK
campaign

The potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that
might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in their networks are significant. To help companies
detect and hunt for ColunmTK, we have provided a full list of indicators of compromise
(IOCs) that we retrieved. MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE Shield, and recommendations are
available at the end of this blog post. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team informed CERT
India and Air India of its findings so that they can take the necessary steps to mitigate the
threat.
Background

2/15

On May 21, Air India, India's flag carrier, published an official statement on their website
about a data breach. The announcement revealed that the breach was caused by a February
incident at the airline's IT service provider, which is responsible for processing customers'
personally identifiable information (PII). However, that statement has since been corrected. It
came to light that the cyberattack on this IT service provider affected 4,500,000 data subjects
globally, including data related to Air India's customers.

3/15

Shortly after Air India's public announcement, the database allegedly related to their security
breach was put up for sale on an underground market at USD 3,000.

According to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system, the alleged database was
published on a fraudulent resource known for reselling data that has been published on
various data-leak websites. Because the database had never surfaced anywhere on the dark
web, nor in the public domain, Group-IB researchers considered it fake and decided to
instead look deeper and discovered that the post about Air India's alleged data had nothing
to do with what happened in reality. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team soon realized that in
this other attack on Air India they were dealing with a sophisticated nation-state threat actor,
rather than another financially motivated cybercriminal group.
Compromise of Air India's network
In mid-February 2021, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system detected infected
devices that were part of Air India's computer network. Starting from at least February 23,
2021, a device inside the company's network communicated with a server with the IP
address 185[.]118[.]166[.]66. According to Group-IB's Network Graph, this server has hosted
Cobalt Strike, a popular post-exploitation framework, since December 11, 2020 (we will come
back to it a little later).

Lifetime of a Cobalt Strike tag in Group-IB's Network Graph
The patient zero that started communicating with the C&C server was a device named
«SITASERVER4» with the local IP address 172[.]16[.]11[.]103 and managed by AirIndia.
After the attackers established persistence in the network and obtained passwords, they
began moving laterally. The threat actor collected information inside the local network,
including names of network resources and their addresses.
Below are examples of commands that were used for lateral movement:
The results of some commands:
The attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations
using hashdump and mimikatz. The attackers tried to escalate local privileges with the help
of BadPotato malware. BadPotatoNet4.exe was uploaded to one of the devices inside the
victim's network under the name SecurityHealthSystray.exe. According to our data, at least
20 devices from Air India's network were compromised during the lateral movement stage.
The attackers used DNS-txt requests to connect the bots to the C&C server. The following
domains were used for DNS tunneling.
ns2[.]colunm[.]tk;

5/15

ns1[.]colunm[.]tk.

The name of the campaign, ColunmTK, is derived from these initially discovered domains.
It was also found that the attackers extracted 233,390,032 bytes of data from the following
devices:
SITASERVER4
AILCCUALHSV001
AILDELCCPOSCE01
AILDELCCPDB01
WEBSERVER3
According to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution data, the compromised devices
were located in different subnets, which may indicate that the compromise affected various
segments of Air India's network. While the initial attack vector remains unknown, according
to Group-IB's records, the attack on Air India lasted for at least 2 months and 26 days. It took
the attackers 24 hours and 5 minutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the
airline's network.

ColunmTK Timeline
Connections with APT41
Group-IB researchers believe with moderate confidence that the ColunmTK campaign was
carried out by APT41, a prolific Chinese-speaking nation-state threat actor. APT41, also
known as WICKED SPIDER (PANDA), Winnti Umbrella, and BARIUM, is believed to have

6/15

been engaging in state-sponsored espionage in China's interests as well as committing
financially motivated cybercrimes. According to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution
system, the threat actor has been active since at least 2007.
APT41 is known for stealing digital certificates for its cyber espionage operations. India is a
frequent target of Chinese nation-state adversaries.
When analyzing the network infrastructure of the C&C-server involved in the cyberattack
against Air India, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system revealed that the threat
actor used a specific SSL certificate, which was detected on five hosts only.

Intelligence & Attribution system
Let's take a closer look at these five IP addresses.
One of them, 45[.]61[.]136[.]199, was attributed to APT41(aka Barium) by Microsoft in their
recent research.

It is worth looking at another IP address from the list: 104[.]224[.]169[.]214. This IP address
was used as an A record for two domains: server04[.]dns04[.]com and
service04[.]dns04[.]com. The IP address was also used to host the Cobalt Strike framework
and shared an SSL certificate, b3038101fd0e8b11c519f739f12c7e9b60234d3b, with
ColunmTK's IP address 185[.]118[.]166[.]66. When analyzing the dns04[.]com subdomains,
we found that these domains were parked at the IP address 127.0.0.1 on the same date:
April 15, 2021. According to Group-IB researchers, APT41 usually parks their domains for
some time at 127.0.0.1 after their campaigns are over.

Another interesting domain is service[.]dns22[.]ml. This domain shared the SSL certificate
b3038101fd0e8b11c519f739f12c7e9b60234d3b with ColunmTK's IP address and was
parked at 127.0.0.1 on January 15, 2021. Security researchers found that the IP address
104[.]224[.]169[.]214 was used as the IP address for a shellcode loader in APT41's earlier
campaigns, in which the domain service[.]dns22[.]ml was also used.
Group-IB researchers discovered a file named "Install.bat" (SHA17185bb6f1dddca0e6b5a07b357529e2397cdee44). The file was uploaded by the attackers to
some of the compromised devices inside Air India's network as part of the ColunmTK
campaign. The file is very similar to one used by APT41 in a different campaign described by
FireEye researchers.
In both cases, the files were used to establish persistence in the network. The files are very
similar in the way they launch a DLL file as a service and create keys in the registry.

Group-IB researchers believe with moderate confidence that the ColunmTK campaign
against Air India was carried out by the Chinese nation-state threat actor APT41.
