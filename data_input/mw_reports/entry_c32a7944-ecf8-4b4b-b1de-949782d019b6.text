Lyceum suicide drone 23.6.22

23.06.2022

Abstract
ClearSky discovered a new malware associated with the Iranian SiameseKitten (Lyceum) group with
medium-high confidence.
The file is downloaded from a domain registered on June 6th, and it communicates with a previously
unknown command and control server whose IP address is adjacent to that of the domain. This
indicates an attacker-controlled at least two IP’s on the same range.
The downloaded file is a reverse shell that impersonates an Adobe update. The group has previously
used this method1
The reverse shell is dropped by a parent file signed with a fake Microsoft certificate, along with a lure
PDF document and an executable designed to establish persistence.
There seems to be a shared use of fake Microsoft certificates by a variety of Iranian groups, as
Phosphorus was previously observed using the same method2.
Additionally, the lure PDF document relates to drone attacks conducted in Iran, resembling a similar
document previously employed by SiameseKitten3.

Reverse Shell File
The reverse shell file's details are as follows:

File Name: viewPDF[.]exe
File Type: Win32 EXE
MD5: 7b4c70526b499e4d7f3d77a47235a67c
SHA-1: 8dbc4d59ba9f5c9b6b49cc9fbdbf8eef8cbdf972
SHA-256: c41265cdf0425d5023db9b42ad58330c9f0e0d187eab7ce77ca09ccf1b1a9414

The file appears to be an Adobe PDF document, using the company's icon and listing it in its details.
An attempt was made by the attackers to avoid detection by registering the file as created on
29.06.2044

Following is the encrypted information relayed to the C&C server:

It looks like a reverse shell waiting for instructions from the attacker, downloaded after the parent file
is executed.
Parent File
The parent file’s details are the following:

File Name: irdrones1.exe, viewPDF.scr
File Type: Win32 EXE
MD5: 29b6b195cf0671901b75b7d2ac6814f6
SHA-1: 6745f60a8bf6a960d2617e6387f6748e03e13f7a
SHA-256: 8883bbd14017d0946aefd2c6fbc7b2c9b0b6b2439f96125bf4ae1c3d314a03c7
The file was initially submitted on June 6th, uploaded from the United Arab Emirates. Its creation date
is registered as 25.06.2020, but the certificate shows 08.06.2022 as the signing date. This also aligns
with common detection avoidance methods:

Its serial number cannot be verified, as it does not exist, indicating that it was faked to avoid detection.
Checking URLs related to the file shows that it was downloaded from the following domain:
hxxp[://]planet-informer[.]me/pdf/?id=1026&pid=316

The link is active, and the file is functional at the time of writing this report:

The website’s IP address is 89[.]39[.]149[.]19:

Once the file is downloaded, a C&C server with an adjacent IP address is contacted, 89[.]39[.]149[.]18
using port 6500:

Both addresses belong to the same AS, and the same registry:

As shown in the following screenshots, the PDF File (.pdf) lure document used in this attack
compares to the lure document used during a previously observed attack from March 2022:
