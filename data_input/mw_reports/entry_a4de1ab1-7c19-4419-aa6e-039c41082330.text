INTRODUCTION

1.1 Executive Summary

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Wireless technology has greatly transformed our world. Influenced by the proliferation of smartphones and
tablets, the use of wireless technology in industry has transformed work being performed and continues to
grow at a rapid pace. Wireless technology has great appeals to many manufacturers, for example, industrial
automation systems, which include process control, discrete manufacturing, and safety systems. Applying
wireless technologies in new or existing industrial systems for monitoring and controlling equipment and
processes eliminates costly cabling and enables configuration flexibility. In addition, using wireless
technologies can improve plant-floor operating conditions, performance, and efficiency in emerging smart
manufacturing practices.
Wireless technology has been used in industry for many years, for example, the licensed bands, which have
the advantage of interference-free operation in general. It has provided years of reliable communications
for monitoring and controlling processes, where using cables is either too costly or impractical. When
interference is encountered, there is always legal recourse. In recent years, license-free wireless
technologies based on the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio frequency (RF) bands are
proliferating and providing industry many options for solution choices, such as wireless networking for
mobile workers and wireless sensor networks for process optimization and asset management. However,
the explosive growth of such technologies would cause potential interference problems. In addition,
adoption and use of wireless technology has often been hampered by a perceived lack of reliability,
integrity, and security, especially when wireless communication is often corrupted or disrupted in harsh
industrial settings. So, which wireless technology is best for your application and what approach and
precautions should be taken to ensure reliable operation? Simply speaking, there is no one single solution
for wireless, since it depends on communication distance between devices, RF requirements, network
topology, communication protocol, data rate, network size, and amount of interference in the industrial
environment. Thus, understanding the capabilities and applications of wireless technologies will allow
users to realize the benefits of wireless, while avoiding the problems of misapplication in challenging
industrial environments, in which many potential physical obstructions and sources of interference existed.
Through interactions with industry, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) researchers
understood the need of an industrial wireless guideline document, which will help manufacturers, users,
and their technology suppliers to design, assess, select, and deploy secure, wireless systems that can perform
dependably in their factory settings and conditions. Thus, NIST organized a joint industrial wireless
workshop with IEEE on March 13, 2017[1]. The purpose of the workshop was to explore latest and future
wireless technologies for establishing best practice guidelines to help manufacturers and users make
confident decisions in selecting and applying appropriate wireless technologies for their plants or factories
based on their operating requirements and environments. During the discussion, key elements, such as
wireless technology categories and selection, spectrum selection and monitoring, radio frequency (RF)
concerns, tools, and methods for testing, and acceptance plan for deployment, etc., were intensely discussed
and considered to be included in the guidelines document. At the end of the workshop, a consensus was
reached for NIST to organize an ad-hoc working group with the aim to conduct monthly working group
meetings to develop a best-practice guidelines document to be published by NIST in September 2018. NIST
announced this effort in the Federal Register through “the formation of a technical working group (TWG)
to develop best practices guidelines in selecting and deploying industrial wireless solutions within industrial
environments, such as process control and discrete manufacturing. Guidelines will consider the entire
wireless ecosystem within factories with emphasis on wireless networks operating on the factory floor. This
includes factory/plant instrumentation, control systems, and back-haul networks. The guidelines will be

technology and vendor agnostic and will address the current needs of industry to have independent
guidelines based on user requirements and measurement science research. Volunteers from industry joined
the TWG. Through the dedicated work of the TWG members, this document “Guide to Industrial Wireless
Systems Deployments” is thus created for industry to use. This document is intended to be a practical guide
used by engineers and managers facilitating them to go through the process of defining the objectives of
their wireless systems and examining the environments where the wireless systems are to be deployed, then
helping them in selecting, designing, deploying, and monitoring the wireless systems using existing
technology in a factory. Sufficient background materials about wireless technologies are provided, so that
the users have a basic understanding of wireless systems being addressed. Thus, the document is aimed to
be a succinct, easy-to-use, reference guide, equipped with checklists throughout the lifecycle of wireless
technology from concept and design to deployment and monitoring.

1.2 Purpose and Scope
The purpose of the document is to provide best-practice guidelines for an integrated methodology that aims
to enable, assess, and assure the real-time performance of secure wireless systems in smart manufacturing
systems. These guidelines also aim to enable users, manufacturers, technology providers, and solution
providers to design, select, deploy, configure, and assess robust, safe, reliable, and secure integrated
wireless systems, with consideration of any co-existence and interference avoidance issues in smart
manufacturing systems. This document will only address existing wireless technologies used in industrial
environments. Advanced wireless technologies are outside the scope of the document. A revision of the
document may be warranted when new and relevant wireless standards and technologies are adopted and
used in industry.

1.3 Intended Audience
This document is intended to be used as a practical guide by control engineers, operational technology
professionals, information technology professionals, chief executives, security executives, factory floor
managers, and wireless system integrators interested in deploying wireless systems in industrial
environments.

1.4 Document Organization
The guidelines document is organized as follows:

INDUSTRIAL WIRELESS FUNDAMENTALS

2.1 Industrial Control Systems

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Industrial systems are those systems that employ machinery to accomplish a set of tasks to produce products
or provide a service. Industrial control system (ICS) is a general term that encompasses several types of
control systems and associated instrumentation used in industrial technology[2]. This includes supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), human-machine
interfaces (HMI), and other smaller control system configurations such as programmable logic controllers
(PLC) and microcontrollers often found in the industrial sectors. Industrial systems can be categorized into
different types of systems based on the speed of production or the characteristic of materials and flow.
Industrial systems may be categorized as flow-based, batch-based, or job-based systems. A flow-based
system, also called a continuous process, include systems such as oil refineries (Figure 1) and water
treatment. Job-based systems, also called discrete manufacturing systems, include the manufacture of
machines or products in discrete steps. An aircraft assembly line is an example of a discrete system. Batchsystem may be considered a hybrid of discrete and continuous processes. Food production is an example
of a batch process. Continuous, discrete, and batch manufacturing processes are quite different in their
physical properties, construction, and locality. Continuous processes are often referred to as plants while
discrete processes are referred to as factories. Herein, we use the terms plant and factory interchangeably.

Figure 2. Simplified Discrete Manufacturing Process
Continuous processes include oil refineries as shown in Figure 1, pipelines, chemical plants, water
purification, and waste water processes. Materials in continuous processes are typically liquid or gas and
undergo heating, cooling, compression, and extraction. Process variables include temperature, pressure,
flow, and container level. Actuation typically regards setting of a set-point, speed control of a machine, or
controlling flow of material through a valve.

Figure 3. Discrete manufacturing process
with robot workers, sensors, and actuators.

Figure 2 illustrates a simplified discrete manufacturing
process. Factories will often divide the operation into
zones and conduits as described in the industrial
automation cyber-security (IACS) standard publication
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
62443[3]. Discrete manufacturing operations are
divided into the factory floor, a factory data center, the
corporate business enterprise, and finally third-party
internet or cloud services. The factory floor is then subdivided into work-cells shown in Figure 3 where
specific tasks are performed.
In advanced
manufacturing operations, work-cells may have
reconfigurable purpose for a dynamic task schedule.
Within the factory, wireless may be used in place of

5

wires for applications such as input-output (IO) instrumentation, command and control actuation, personnel
safety, security and surveillance, asset and vehicle tracking, and back-haul connectivity to the factory data
center. By deploying wireless intelligently, factory engineers may better achieve their objectives.
Instrumentation within a discrete manufacturing process tends to include ON/OFF sensors such as limit
switches, counters, ON/OFF actuators, and communication links carrying command control information
for robotic workers. Process information is carried from the work-cells to a centralized data center for
additional control decisions and analytics.

2.2 Wireless Technology
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Industrial wireless networks (IWNs) are a key enabler of many aspects of advanced manufacturing. IWNs
promise lower installation costs compared with wired alternatives, increased operational flexibility,
improved factory visibility, and enhanced mobility. Wireless networks are not dissimilar to wired networks
with the key exception being the transmission medium. Wired networks typically operate over copper
wires, coaxial cable, or fiber optic cable depending on the network type. Wireless networks operate without
wires or cables using the electromagnetic propagation. As such, wireless networks operate within a shared
medium that is publicly accessible. A listing of wireless technologies is given in Table 1.

Home and Office

This includes standards-based communications system typically found in the
office environment but may be useful for the factory. Includes IEEE 802.11[4]
variants and Wi-Fi compliant devices. Bluetooth also falls into this category.

Instrumentation

Includes systems specifically designed for factory operation. IEEE 802.15.4[5]
standards such as International Society of Automation (ISA) 100.11a,
WirelessHART (IEC 62591:2016), IEC 62601, and ZigBee fall into this
category[6]. High-performance standards built on IEEE 802.11 include the
Wireless Networks for Industrial Automation - Factory Automation (WIA-FA)
IEC 62948[7]. Many exceptional proprietary options exist as well.

Wide Area Sensing

Some applications require the ability to transmit over long distances with minimal
power to conserve battery life for sensing and control over wide geographical
distances. Examples include LoRaWAN and Sigfox as well as modes of 4G and
5G cellular radio standards.

data links, optical (visible light), and land-mobile radio. This category includes
technologies supporting video and voice communication.

Tailored solutions

Includes technologies such as radiating coaxial cable and tropo-scatter solutions
that are designed for mission criteria that have unique requirements and require a
solution that cannot be met with off-the-shelf alternatives.

2.3 Wireless Networking Basics

RF energy will not penetrate easily into
conductive materials but will form
shallow eddies that reflect most of the
energy back into space. Non-conductive
materials will usually absorb RF energy
thereby causing attenuation.
Some
materials such as wood and dry-wall will
Figure 4. Spectral activity in the 2.4 GHz ISM Band
allow RF energy to penetrate through.
This effect is common within wood housing and offices which is why home routers work well. Liquids
including fog are significant absorbers as are leaves and trees. Absorption properties depend on the
frequency of transmission. In general, lower frequency RF waves penetrate walls and lose energy slower
than high frequency RF waves. To receive RF energy, an antenna is required to collect the energy and
convert that energy into electrical current which can then be processed electronically and converted into
usable data.
RF energy can be visualized using standard test equipment such as a spectrum analyzer. A spectrum
analyzer displays RF power versus frequency. Shown in Figure 4 is a capture of activity in the 2.4 GHz
industrial, scientific, and medical radio (ISM) band. In this capture, Wi-Fi activity exists in the standard
channels supporting file transfer, video, and voice communications. Activity from wireless sensor
instrumentation also exists producing narrowband frequency hopping transmissions. Since both
transmissions co-exist in the same RF band, these devices may interfere with each other. Other devices
such as cell phones with active 2.4 GHz
hot spots and microwave ovens could

environment may obstruct, attenuate, or

also result in diffraction even if a line-of-sight (LOS) path exists. Refer to the explanation of the First

2.3.1 Radio Frequency Communication
Radio frequency (RF) communication is used to describe any form of communication that uses
electromagnetic spectrum extending from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. Most communications occur between 300
MHz and 6 GHz. The term RF is used synonymously with the term “wireless” although they can have
subtle differences in meaning. In RF communication, oscillating electrical current is shaped per the
information being transmitted. It is then
converted into electric and magnetic
fields which propagate together as waves
in the surrounding medium which is
usually air or vacuum.

into useful information if the signal energy was high enough to overcome naturally and artificially occurring
noise and interference. Multi-path reflections may result in significant interference and information loss
even if signal power is high.
2.3.2 RF Considerations
The following terms and definitions will help the reader to better understand the vocabulary used in wireless
technology and have a stronger understanding of wireless networking considerations.
2.3.2.1 General Concepts and Definitions
Antenna – A device that converts electrical energy into propagating electromagnetic waves or the reverse.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Antenna Polarity – The orientation of the directionality of electromagnetic waves produced by an antenna.
Common polarities are vertical, horizontal, and circular. Receive antennas should be oriented such that its
polarity matches that of the transmitting antenna polarity.
Bandwidth – The amount of spectrum occupied by a signal. For example, a standard IEEE 802.11g
transmission will use a nominal 22 MHz of bandwidth. An IEEE 802.15.4 transmission on which ZigBee,
WirelessHART, and ISA100 Wireless are designed will use a nominal 5 MHz of bandwidth.
Carrier – A single frequency sinusoidal signal represented by a vertical line or spike in frequency.
Channel – A term used to identify a physical communications link and includes the characteristics of the
entire path of information flow from transmitter to receiver. A channel is defined by electrical and
electromagnetic characteristics of the transmission medium such as bandwidth and distortions.
Interference – RF power, typically in the RF band of interest, that disrupts communications by inhibiting
the ability of a receiver to decode a transmission. Sources of interference could include anything that
radiates electromagnetic (EM) energy such as machinery and undesirable radio devices.
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) – Ratio of signal power to naturally occurring emissions such as thermal
noise and cosmic background radiation. Maximizing SNR is the primary goal of wireless communications.
Signal-to-Noise-And-Interference Ratio (SNIR) – Ratio of signal power to the sum of naturally occurring
noise power and interference power. Minimizing the contribution of interference to SNIR is an important
goal of a wireless communications system.
Power Decibels – A logarithmic representation of a voltage or power relative to a reference. Power is
converted to decibels by the equation P  10 log10 p . The notation dBW and dBm represent power levels
relative to 1 Watt and 1 milliwatt, respectively. The notation dB denotes a ratio of two numbers and should
not be used to denote power.
Link Budget – Calculations that predict the probability that a transmission will be successfully detected
and decoded by the receiver. A link budget will account for transmission power, signal formatting, noise,
signal distortions, interference, receiver characteristics, and the link reliability requirements.
Link Margin – The difference in decibels (dB) between the ability of a receiver to successfully receive a
transmission and the expected minimum received power. A link margin of 10 dB indicates that a signal
could be attenuated by an additional factor of 10 before it can no longer be received. A link margin should
accommodate reasonable unexpected attenuations, distortions, and interference not directly addressed by
the link budget.
2.3.2.2 Transmitter Concepts and Definitions
Transmitter – The device responsibility for transmitting information wirelessly.

8

Transmit Power – the average amount of RF energy per unit power emitted by the transmit antenna. This
is typically specified in Watts, dBW, or dBm.
Bit Rate – The average or peak amount of data transmitted during an interval of time. This is represented
as bits per second (bps).
Duty Cycle – The percentage at which a transmitter is active.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Modulation – The method by which information is used to modify the behavior of an RF carrier. Different
modulations exist such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation
(PM). Digital modulations are discrete versions of the above modulations. Common modulations used in
industrial communications include binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying
(QPSK), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), among others. Wi-Fi uses a combination of BPSK,
QPSK, and QAM depending on channel quality.
Error Control Coding (ECC) – A method to increase reliability of a communications link by adding data
redundancy that can detect and correct errors produced by the channel. ECC increases the amount of
bandwidth requirements or decreasing the amount of useful information over a channel.
Frequency Hopping (FH) – A process by which the carrier frequency is changed during or between
transmissions accordingly to a pre-defined synchronized method. With FH, transmitter and receiver must
tune to the same frequency at precisely the same time. FH hopping adds a layer of complexity to a system
but also makes interception or disruption of the wireless system more difficult, thereby making the system
more reliable.
Spread Spectrum – A process of spreading RF energy beyond what is needed to transmit information for
the purpose of improved medium access, better interference immunity, or minimization of signal detection.
Payload – The information being transmitted. The size of the payload factors into transmission duration.
All communication systems have a limit to the size of a payload before fragmentation is required. Not all
communication systems support fragmentation. At the lowest layers of a communication system, the
payload includes all data encoding and framing.
2.3.2.3 Receiver Concepts
Receiver – The device responsible for decoding incoming transmissions in accordance with an established
protocol.
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) – A measurement of received signal power.
Received Signal Quality Indicator (RSQI) – A measurement of the quality of the received signal
Sensitivity – The minimum signal strength, SNR, or SNIR required by a receiver to decode an incoming
transmission.
Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) – RF energy that is adjacent to the channel containing a desired
signal.
Adjacent Channel Rejection (ACR) – The ability of the receiver to suppress ACI.
Dynamic Range – The difference between the maximum and minimum received signal power. A large
dynamic range is particularly helpful in accommodating strong ACI that leaks past RF filtering.
Selectivity – The ability of a device to decode a transmission on one frequency without interference from
transmissions on other frequencies.

2.3.2.4 Electromagnetic Interference
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is always present to some degree in a wireless network. EMI when in
the radio frequency spectrum creates a disturbance that disrupts intended communications. The disturbance
can degrade performance by introducing RF energy into the circuits of wireless devices. When the
disturbance is strong enough to overcome the intended signal, communication loss will result. Sources of
EMI include both man-made and natural sources. Natural radio sources typically will not interfere with
network operation as the devices or deployment locations are designed to accommodate some natural
interference. Man-made interference can include other competing radio devices that operate in the same
frequency band or nearby in frequency. Noise from rotating electrical motors can also occur and typically
affects radio bands below 400 MHz. Common interference sources include personal devices such as cellphones in which the Wi-Fi hotspot is enabled. It can also include non-communication devices such as
micro-wave ovens. EMI can also emanate from intentional radio jammers designed to disrupt
communications.
2.3.2.5 Human Wireless Exposure
Wireless emissions exposure is a recognized concern. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) conducts research on protecting workers from proven and possible EMF health risks due
to exposure to radio frequency and other types of emissions. The International Commission on NonIonizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) of the World Health Organization (WHO) also publishes guidance
on radio frequency radiation exposure limits. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) posted
OET BULLETIN 56 [8], “Questions and Answers about Biological Effects and Potential Hazards of
Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields” which was last updated in 1999. This bulletin, outlines maximum
permissible levels of exposure for occupational controlled exposure and uncontrolled exposure.
2.3.3 Networking Considerations
Most networking systems are built upon a layered architecture called the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)
model [9]. Functional layers within the OSI model serve a logical purpose to facilitate a communication
service and are shown in Table 2. In a wireless network, layers 1 and 2 of the protocol stack includes all
the framing, medium access, error correction coding, modulation, and transmission of a signal. Above
those layers are the layers used for logical addressing, connection establishment, and retransmission in case
of errors. Layer 2 is responsible for hardware level addressing and framing. The medium access control
(MAC) address is used by Layer 2. The network layer, Layer 3, is responsible for logical addressing,
routing, and traffic control. For protocols such as Wi-Fi, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are used in
Layer 3. IP addresses are then associated with MAC addresses.

Layers 5 and 6 are not always necessary and may be combined with higher layers. Layer 7, the Application
layer, serves as the interface to the functions of the system that use wireless communication service. It

10

includes an application programming interface (API) that allows programs to access the protocol stack. In
a wireless sensor, for example, all functional elements would be implemented to connect to a network,
transmit sensor readings, receive commands, manage reliability, and maintain connections. A
microcontroller or processor within the wireless sensor device would access the wireless network through
the Application Layer API.

A network logically consists of nodes and logical connections or edges between the nodes. Depending on
the design of the network, nodes can be organized into different topologies. A topology defines how nodes
within a network are arranged. Shown in Figure 6 are various network topologies including a peer-to-peer
(P2P) single hop, P2P multi-hop, star, and mesh topologies. A single-hop P2P topology is used for directed
communications between two nodes. A microwave link between two buildings or a link between a tank
farm and central office are examples of a single-hop topology. A multi-hop topology is an extension of
single-hop where distance between nodes is a concern and additional range is required.
More complex topologies include the star topology and the mesh topology. Star topologies also known as
“hub and spoke” are designed to have a central mediator such as an access point in a home/office wireless
network. Through the star topology, nodes can communicate together through the central node. The central
node in a star topology coordinates communication within the network. In mesh topologies, nodes within
the network can communicate directly with other nodes without the need for a central node. Star topology
networks typically have better delay determinism than mesh networks because the hopping is determined
before deployment. An example of a star topology industrial wireless network is ISA100.11a. Wi-Fi and
other IEEE 802.11 variants are also usually star topology networks by default.
A mesh network will have better reliability because data may be routed through alternate nodes in the
network, but it achieves this reliability at the expense of deterministic delay. Mesh networks can be
configured to have deterministic latency under normal operating circumstances. Examples of mesh
networks are WirelessHART and ZigBee. The ISA100.11a network can be configured to behave as a mesh,

(b) multi-hop

(c) star pattern

(d) mesh

11

but it’s default is the star topology to ensure reliability and latency determinism. A Wi-Fi network can also
be configured as a mesh network.
Other important considerations for the wireless network are now discussed. These considerations have
impacts on the selection, deployment, and maintenance of the network and should be considered carefully.
Addressing – How the network identifies nodes. An address is a unique identifier that the network uses to
establish connections and route information. The addressing scheme used by a network will limit the
number of devices that the wireless system can support.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Naming – A human-readable identifier for a node or device within a network. Addressing the network
may support identification that would be useful for a human
to identify a device within the network.
Network Throughput – The amount of useful information
that can traverse the network within a finite amount of time.
Throughput must be measured as useful information;
therefore, a specification of throughput should not include
network overhead such as packet headers and
acknowledgements. Throughput within a wireless network
will depend greatly on the conditions of the network and the
topology of the network. Single routing points such as what
is shown in Figure 7 can become stress points within a
network limiting throughput under changing RF conditions
and can also be a single point of failure as one node will be
the conduit for one section of the network.
Number of Devices – A wireless network will have a limit
in the number of devices that it can support. More devices
on the network will have an impact on the reporting rates
that are possible and may contribute to self-interference
depending on the type of network used.

Bottleneck and
point of failure

bottleneck at a single router node.

Reliability – In a wireless network, reliability is a measure of the probability that a logical data path
between a source and destination within a network, such as a sensor and a PLC, is available such that data
will be received by its intended recipient within specified time constraints. This should not be confused
with metrics associated with low-level packet transmissions within the network such as packet error rate.
Reliability within an industrial network is a measure of likelihood that information will be guaranteed to be
received by an intended consumer on-time. For example, a proximity sensor reading within a mesh network
could be delivered within a 100ms deadline to a PLC for feedback control with 99.999% success.
Reliability is one of the most important factors in a automation and control networks
Latency – In general, latency is the time that it takes for data to travel from its source to its destination.
For industrial sensing applications, this is more aptly defined as the time delay from when a measurement
is taken and delivered to its intended recipient. For industrial actuation and control, it is the time from when
a command is issued to when it is received by its intended recipient and action begins. Latency in an
industrial system includes the physical measurement and actuation process.
Encryption – A method used to encode data to prevent unauthorized access to the data. Encryption is
important to protecting intellectual property information that may be construed by observing data traversing
a factory network. While a wireless network utilizes the electromagnetic spectrum, which is an open natural
resource, this does not mean that data is not secure. Like wired networks, wireless networks can employ
12

strong encryption which defends against unauthorized data access. It is important then to verify that the
level of encryption that a candidate wireless network uses will meet the needs of the security risk level of
the factory.
Authentication – A method used to validate that a device or user is authorized to gain network access and
that the source of data is genuine. Authentication is an important aspect of factory security linked to process
availability and can be more important than encryption. Devices within a network should be authenticated.
Wireless networks should support device authentication. Management services supporting the network
should support user authentication. User passwords should be updated regularly and default passwords
should never be used.

Key management – The set of management tools, protocols, and procedures for updating keys for devices
in the field and those already deployed. Some systems require keys to be loaded by physically touching
the device whereas other systems can perform this task remotely through a service called over-the-air
rekeying (OTAR). When a device is deployed, it may be impractical and costly to locate the device and
send personnel to the device to load new keys. A wireless system that supports OTAR capabilities will
improve the maintainability of the system.
Over-the-air programming (OTAP) – A capability that allows a device or devices to be reconfigured or
reprogrammed once it is deployed. Like OTAR, new configuration parameters for devices such as a change
in reporting rate would be made easier with OTAP. Intelligent devices that can be reprogrammed with new
software may also use OTAP capabilities to make deployment of the software easier.
Over-the-air-rekeying (OTAR) – A capability in which data signal encryption "code" keys are updated
in secure information systems by conveying the keys through encrypted wireless communication channels.
Power Source – The source of electrical power. In some plants and factories, power is easily accessible,
and in some access to power is limited. The type of power greatly determines the capabilities of the wireless
system and devices. If a wired power source is available, it should be used instead of batteries as batteries
require periodic replacement. Batteries are useful as a backup to wired power sources especially for
mission-critical applications. Other sources of power include solar power and piezoelectric power from
vibrations. Solar power is a good way of powering wireless devices if ample light is available and dust in
the environment does not cover the solar cells over time.
Reboot/Reorganization Time – This is the amount of time that it takes to reboot all network devices that
have lost power and to re-establish the network. After power is re-established, it takes time for devices to
boot and for connections to be made. Some wireless systems will take seconds to reconnect a device to the
network. Other systems could take minutes per device which could lead to hours for all devices in a power
outage where key devices such as a router or gateway lose power. This concern exemplifies the need for
stable and reliable power sources. Under extreme situations, an RF interferer could cause the same type of
network condition if the interference is powerful enough and persists for a long time. Each wireless system
has strengths and weaknesses in this area, and systems should be carefully evaluated against mission
objectives before being deployed.
Intrinsic Safety – A protection technique for safe operation of electrical equipment in hazardous areas by
limiting the energy, electrical and thermal, available for ignition. Areas with dangerous concentrations of
flammable gases or dust are found in applications such as petrochemical refineries and mines. Wireless
devices may be labeled with an intrinsic safety rating. Intrinsic safety is defined by The National Fire
Protection Association (NFPA) 70E Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace[10].

2.4 Wireless Applicability and Technical Challenges

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Wireless has many advantage over wired installations, and it has many challenges. Applications of factory
wireless can include process monitoring, condition alarming, product and asset tracking, supervisory
control, and feedback control. Use of wireless will depend on expected cost savings over wired options
and the technical requirements of the application. Technical requirements can often be linked to the
mobility, latency, loss, and scale constraints. Table 3 lists the latency, loss, and scale requirements of
typical classes of industrial applications[11]. Note that while this table lists typical constraints, every
application is different. Constraints can vary and easily exceed the limits specified in the table. Users must
understand the requirements of their respective systems before embarking on any wireless enhancement.
Latency here refers to the time difference between when an event is sensed and when it is received by
another actor within the system. Loss is a measure of how well events are communicated on time within a
system. Packet error rate can be used to describe loss but should not be confused with loss since loss is an
end-to-end measure that includes more than the communication system. Scale is a count of the number of
nodes on the network. Networks have limitations on the number of supported nodes. It is also important
to acknowledge that more nodes can mean slower reporting rates which impact latency.

Since the electromagnetic spectrum otherwise known as the radio frequency (RF) spectrum is a publicly
accessible yet a limited natural resource, special consideration must be placed on the selection of the RF
operating band for any wireless deployment. These considerations include spectrum availability,
bandwidth, impacts on distance and propagation, sources of interference, and security concerns. A table of
wireless applicability is given in Table 8 in Appendix B. The reader is encouraged to consult this table for
guidance when selecting a technology for their application.

2.5 Electromagnetic Spectrum Governance

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

The electromagnetic spectrum (EM) is a limited
natural resource. Of the possible frequency bands
available for use, only a fraction of spectrum is
available for legal commercial use. Within the
United States, the electromagnetic spectrum is
regulated by the Federal Communications
Commission
(FCC)
and
the
National
Telecommunications
and
Information
Administration (NTIA). The FCC has authority
over non-federal communications while the NTIA
is concerned with federal communications. Use of
the electromagnetic spectrum will require
authorization in some form from either of the two
Figure 8. United States radio spectrum frequency
agencies. Radio frequency allocations [12] for the
allocations chart.
United States is shown in Figure 8. For most
industrial establishments, FCC authorization is
included in the system being procured. For federal industrial establishments, NTIA authorization is
required to operate in a licensed band.
2.5.1 Licensing
Use of the EM spectrum is divided into two categories, licensed and unlicensed spectrum. Licensed
spectrum requires FCC authorization for each specific use or device. Unlicensed spectrum such as the
industrial, scientific, and medical radio (ISM) band is deemed a public resource and includes the 902 to 928
MHz, 2.400 to 2.4835 GHz, and 5.725 to 5.875 GHz radio bands. Industrial wireless devices typically
operate over these unlicensed bands. While many wireless systems are designed to operate over the ISM
bands, the systems will be subjected to the interference from other devices using the bands. Licensed
spectrum has fewer wireless systems options, but it provides a better guarantee of available spectrum to
operate devices without interference from others wireless systems.
Coordination with bordering nations is required for licensed RF applications in proximity to those borders.
Furthermore, all devices operating within the United States including those purchased from a foreign source
must have an FCC identifier. An FCC ID is a unique identifier assigned to a device registered with the
United States Federal Communications Commission. For legal sale of wireless devices in the United States,
wireless device manufacturers must have the device evaluated by an independent laboratory to ensure it
conforms to FCC standards.
2.5.2 RF Spectrum Planning and Internal Governance
Use of licensed and unlicensed RF bands are regulated by the FCC; however, it is advisable that
organizations track and manage their use of the RF spectrum beyond what is required by the FCC. Tracking
of wireless devices and networks in terms of their spectral usage will help the organization plan for
deployments, manage growth, identify interference sources, and avoid network conflicts. Use of licensed
bands may help to avoid interference, but all RF bands have limited capacity resources, and, hence, planning
is important for its effective use. Having a method for internal governance within a factory enterprise is an
essential part of a factory spectrum planning and monitoring strategy. Internal governance should be
implemented as a governing board with managers and engineers that agree on the short-term and long-term
strategies for use of the EM spectrum within the proximity and confines of their operations. The internal
governance should account for the long-term vision of wireless deployments within the factory.

BUSINESS CASE FOR WIRELESS

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

One of the key enablers of factory automation is the availability of wireless radio frequency devices. Some
applications of radio frequency devices include process control, oil and gas refineries, pharmaceuticals,
food and beverage, autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) control, slotted microwave guides, pendants to
control cranes and machine tools, active and passive radio frequency identifier (RFID) for tracking parts,
tools and consumables, wireless barcode readers, remote sensing of critical process parameters, mobile
telephony, door openers, emergency communication, and general factory Wi-Fi for internet connectivity.
In addition, devices not directly associated with the manufacturing process such as microwave ovens and
mobile telephone hot spots must be included when designing a factory wireless system. As useful as
wireless communications is, it must be recognized that spectrum is limited and there must be judicious
choices about when it should be used, and when wired connections are preferable.
In general terms, wireless (as with any upgrade to a factory or enterprise system) should satisfy a
requirement related to quality, reliability, efficiency, safety, regulation, or environment as shown in Table
4. The requirements pertain to the business enterprise which in the case of a manufacturing operation means
the plant or factory. A wireless deployment should be designed to satisfy one of the key business concerns
listed.
Table 4. Purposes for initiating a wireless systems deployment
Functionality

Is wireless required to achieve an aspect of function within the factory operation?
For example, does the factory require a mobility to achieve a goal?

Reliability

Is reliability of the production line improved? The ability to manufacture
products, parts or assemblies which conform to the engineering definition, and
can demonstrate conformity.

Safety

Are people or equipment made safer? The ability of employees to perform their
jobs free from recognized hazards including falls, hazardous energy, confined
space, ergonomics, and hazardous materials, and being able to demonstrate
compliance with all safety regulations.

Efficiency

The ability to meet target costs and continue forever to reduce unit production
costs.

Quality

The ability to manufacture parts and assemblies which conform to the
engineering definition, and be able to demonstrate conformity.

Environment

Will the environment be better protected or accidents be avoided?

Regulation

WIRELESS LIFECYCLE

Selecting an industrial wireless network (IWN) for factory deployment requires careful attention to
planning and design as well as deployment strategies and monitoring. And IWN must meet the needs for
the functional operation of the plant or factory and satisfy the long term operational goals of the
organization.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Shown in Figure 9 is the generalized lifecycle of a wireless system deployment. Once a need for a
networking solution is identified and wireless is deemed a worthwhile solution to consider, several steps
should be undertaken from the time that the need is identified to the time in which a wireless system is
deployed. The following sections defined the process guidelines for a wireless systems deployment. It
should not be construed as a formal change management process that would replace an existing and wellestablished process within an organization. Change and configuration management are important
considerations for all organizations, and many resources exist to support that process; however, the topic
of change and configuration management is not within the scope of this document. These process
guidelines should be used to inform or enhance mature processes or help to establish a new process within
an organization. The process shown in Figure 9 should also be construed to include feedback between
phases. For example, if during the candidate selection phase, it is determined that key performance
indicators were omitted, then it would be necessary to refine the objectives to accommodate necessary
changes.

Figure 9. Lifecycle Components of Wireless Systems Deployment
When embarking on a wireless enhancement, and the organization deploying such a network is
inexperienced with wireless deployments, it may be prudent to begin with a small deployment or proof-ofconcept. This will allow the organization to learn about wireless while developing a process for wireless
deployments. If an immediate massive deployment is necessary for an inexperienced organization, a system
integrator who is experienced with large-scale wireless deployments will become vital to the success of the
system. An experienced system integrator should be expected to cooperate with factory engineers who
wish to implement the guidance provided within this document. A system integrator cannot replace the due
diligence of the factory engineers to oversee the project and select appropriate technologies for their
operation.

17

The first step in the process is the Identification of Need. Each entity will have a vision for why a factory
enhancement is necessary. It is here that the objectives and success criteria will be defined and that a
wireless system may be considered. The next step is the site survey in which the factory environment is
analyzed comprehensively to determine the requirements for candidate solutions. Once the survey has
taken place and data is readily available from the survey, candidate systems will be selected. Following
candidate selection, a solution will be developed and tested. Performance will be validated against the
original requirements, and a deployment plan will be devised. The end result is a deployed solution or
iteration that meets the technical requirements and effectively addresses the original business goals. It is
important to understand the steps of conducting the site survey, identifying candidates, designing a solution,
and deployment may be an iterative process. Iterative design is a proven and effective means to manage
risk.

4.1 Define Objectives
Before embarking on a wireless systems program within a factory, the business requirements, i.e., the
purpose of the factory enhancement, should be fully understood, documented, and shared among the
stakeholders within the organization. Defining objectives clearly and concisely enables support from within
the organization and a successful deployment.
Defining the objectives will include identifying the reason for beginning a factory enhancement. The
organization should first ask the question: What is the benefit of the factory improvement to the
organization? Section 3 provides a list of success criteria that may be used to drive the implementation of
a wireless system or any factory enhancement program. These criteria include reliability improvements,
improvements in safety for humans and machinery, a reduction in operating cost, product quality
improvements, environmental stewardship, and regulatory compliance. Objectives must be communicated
to management and stakeholders. Realistic technological expectations are defined for the wireless
deployment and communicated to stakeholders. Performance will be ascertained based on measurement
data not supposition.
Wireless technology will not serve all applications. For example, a safety integrated system demands
reliable communications between the safety controller and its sensors and actuators. Wireless is low risk
for applications such as to enable Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) deployments, factory monitoring,
supervisory control, and backup systems to wired. Wireless for safety should address quality of service
requirements for the use case. Wireless systems do not directly address the reliability and latency
requirements of feedback control applications with real-time constraints, but depending on the physical
system requirements, it is possible. Even with developments in wireless technology, a technical solution is
not always possible with respect to addressing security threats such as jamming and other forms of
interference. In such a case, optical wavelength communication may be better suited for such applications.
Therefore, when using wireless for feedback control and safety, a careful risk analysis is required. When
using wireless for safety monitoring, the ISA 84 WG8 technical report may be used as a deployment guide
[13]. A general reference for wireless applicability is given in Table 5. Since technologies can differ and
improve over time, this table should be used as a rule-of-thumb.
Success of the wireless deployment depends on the purpose of the system and measurable objectives.
Wireless may be one component of the overall factory enhancement. Referring to Table 4, the purpose of
the wireless deployment may be to improve reliability, reduce costs, or comply with a new regulation. It is
important that those goals be measurable. Measurement methods and metrics should be selected and agreed
upon by the stakeholders. Objectives should be documented and managed using the organization’s
established procedures.

18

As an example, a cost reduction program may be approached with an IIoT data collection system. After
sufficient data is collected, an optimization algorithm could be used to identify points of process
improvement such as process tuning, robot insertion, and work scheduling. Achievable cost saving targets
would then be agreed upon and the upgrade would commence. In this simple scenario, expected data
reliability and latency targets of the optimization algorithm should be ascertained prior to moving to the
selection of candidates, as those targets would impact selection criteria and performance assessment. If
exact figures are not available, simulation could be used to ascertain down-stream performance. An
educated evaluation using as much data available during the objectives definition phase will help to set
reasonable, measurable objectives while reducing associate risk of failure.

A checklist for Defining Objectives is included in Appendix A-1. These tasks are important to achieving
the objectives of the wireless deployment. Clearly enumerated objectives for the factory enhancement are
necessary to explain how the wireless network will serve to achieve those objectives.
Once objectives are defined and the role that wireless will take to support those objectives is defined,
measurement methodologies will need to be determined. At this point, it is not necessary to exactly define
how measurements will take place; however, it is possible to acknowledge that a measurement-based
performance assessment is needed and to begin thinking about how to accomplish the measuring.
The enterprise may have plans for future growth beyond the current enhancement. More wireless networks
may be needed to achieve future growth requirements of the enterprise. An iterative plan for growth is
commonly used to manage technical risk in some organizations, and future factory network enhancements
may be envisioned. For example, channels in the 5 GHz ISM band are particularly valuable as they support
channel bonding for high throughput applications; therefore, these channels require careful management.
It will be helpful to document those plans and establish a vision for the factory network that includes
wireless technology such that stages such as candidate selection account for that vision.
A security risk assessment is also necessary at the early stages of the program. A plan to implement security
will be an ongoing task for the factory if it hasn’t already been established. Many resources exist that will
explain how to implement a security program. These resources are discussed in Section 6. A security

In general, wireless is not recommended as the primary mode of communication for an SIS, but it could be used as
a backup to wired communication. It is recognized that some SIS designs could require wireless as the only practical
mode of communication in rare cases.

management plan will be an important part of implementing a security program within the factory enterprise
and establishing a secure wireless network.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Wireless networks require bandwidth of the electromagnetic spectrum. Wireless may or may not already
be in use within the factory enterprise; therefore, it will be necessary to conduct a preliminary spectral
occupancy survey of all wireless networks within the factory as well as all sources of interference to include
microwave ovens, employee-owned devices, and outside interference. It will be important to establish the
importance of a spectrum management plan if one is not already established. A spectrum management plan
will contain an inventory of all known wireless networks and sources of electromagnetic emissions. It will
also establish policies and procedures for monitoring the electromagnetic spectrum and taking actions when
events occur. Like the security management plan, the spectrum management plan will be an ongoing
activity that is essential to running a secure and stable wireless network.

4.2 Factory Survey
A factory survey is a critical part of a successful wireless deployment. With a detailed understanding of
the physical environment, RF propagation characteristics, and a full systems inventory will provide valuable
data to make the wireless deployment successful. A factory survey includes an assessment of the available
RF spectrum, and identification of sources of interference, human safety requirements, and an inventory of
factory models, components, interfaces, and requirements. An early RF characterization of the factory
environment may be helpful at this stage, but deferring the RF characterization study to the design stage
after a candidate solution is selected may be more practical and yield more useful information.
A factory survey checklist is provided in Appendix A-2. The list provides useful considerations in
conducting a comprehensive survey of the factory environment. Tailoring of the checklist is encouraged
and will depend on enterprise objectives and processes. Considerations covered in the checklist are
described in the following sections.
4.2.1 Applicable Physical Inventory
Take a comprehensive inventory of the factory components that are envisioned to come into direct or
indirect contact with the wireless network. Factory components could include the following:
physical factory layout – drawings and 2D/3D computer-aid design (CAD) models that depict the physical
environment;
measurement and control points – all process variables within the factory/plant process that may be of
interest to be monitored or controlled;
machines – all machinery to be included in a prognostic, health monitoring, and control program;
mobile robotic platforms – any machine that can be considered autonomous and controlled remotely;
materials – a list of all parts, products, and raw materials that must be tracked throughout the process;
maintenance tools – a list of all maintenance tools such as power tools that must be tracked;
supervisory and feedback control points – a list of all real-time processors used to supervise and control
the operation;
data collection systems – a list of all systems such as databases including interface specifications for each;
data transfer points – a list of all systems that require a broadband data connection for general data or file
transfer;

20

human-machine interfaces – a list of all human machine interface stations and mobile platform,
connectivity requirements, and interface specifications;
employee-owned mobile devices – all device types such as tablets and cell-phones that employees will be
allowed to have in accordance with factory policies; and
Power sources – a list of all cables and power sources that could be used to supply power to devices.

4.2.2 Operational Models
Collect any abstract models such as equations, statistics, pseudo code, process flow diagrams, software, and
data that are available to simulate the factory or otherwise predict factory behavior. Depending on risk of
deploying wireless, running simulations can be a useful tool in predicting data produced by the factory and
identifying sensitivity to network resilience issues. Operational models can be used to validate assumptions
and assure a better set of technical requirements to be levied on the wireless network.

21

4.2.3 Identify Process Variable Specifications
Table 6 lists several data points that may be helpful in constructing an effective wireless deployment.
Selecting a wireless network specifically for either sensing or control instrumentation will require
identifying candidates that can support the specification of signal information or data being communicated.
4.2.4 Identify Safety Issues
Wireless devices could have impacts on the safety within the environment they are used. Some factory
environments must meet Intrinsic Safety considerations to prevent fires or explosions. List all safety
requirements that will affect the selection criteria of wireless devices.

In the previous two sections, the
wireless system requirements were
defined and the site of intended
operation was surveyed. Using the
obtained information, the candidate
selection process is initiated where
various candidates are identified and
their capabilities to satisfy various
requirements are evaluated. At this step
of the selection process, two stages
should be envisioned: 1) Technical
Considerations and 2) Candidates
evaluation. The first stage includes
mapping factory requirements to
network candidate capabilities. The
second stage includes obtaining
information about various candidates,
evaluation and validation of the options
with information against network
requirements, ranking the suitability of
candidates, and finally choosing a
candidate.

devices. As candidate capabilities often drive requirements, identification of technical requirements can be
done in parallel with candidate identification; however, special caution should be taken to avoid candidates
that excessively influence the requirements gathering process. Shown in Appendix A-3 is a candidate
selection checklist. Initially, technical requirements should be enumerated and a prioritization or weighting
factor will need to be determined as not all requirements are equal in importance. Categories of technical
requirements are discussed in the following sections. They include the factory constraints, network
requirements, safety, security, regulatory compliance and internal approvals, and training.
4.3.1.1 Factory Requirements and Constraints
Factory requirements were discussed in Section 4.1 where enterprise objectives of deploying wireless
networking are defined clearly. The applications where wireless networking benefits are defined include
reliability, safety, efficiency, quality, environment and regulatory concerns. Moreover, the criteria for

22

measuring wireless networking performance and its ability to achieve the factory requirements should be
clearly defined. Where wireless is used for deterministic applications or other latency and reliability
sensitive applications, precise requirements for those applications to include reliability, latency, and scale
should be developed. Moreover, factory security considerations will influence the type of wireless
networks that will be considered and should be included in the list of technical considerations.
4.3.1.2 Network Considerations
The following concepts are presented as a guide in enumerating the technical requirements.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Functionality and Applications – Based on various required applications, the need of multiple wireless
networks is considered due to basic differences in the requirements. As an example, the latency and
reliability needs for control loops in discrete manufacturing may require a dedicated wireless network for
this type of applications where slow process monitoring has less reliability requirements and hence a
different type of wireless networks to be used.
RF Band – While comparing various candidate solutions, the operating RF band will be selected according
to performance, factory survey results, spectrum availability, regulatory concerns, and internal governance.
It is unreasonable to expect that an RF band will ever be “pristine” without any sources of interference, and
the selection of candidates should account for this fact. Requirements may need to account for noise and
interference immunity and other practical considerations.
Multi-speed Support – Like the previous point, different applications may work on the same wireless
network but with different speeds or response times. As an example, a wireless network may work for all
monitoring applications because of the same requirement on the network. The monitored processes may
have different rates of change that require different rates of monitoring data transmissions. In this case, the
multi-speed support in the candidate wireless network is needed.
Scalability – One of the factory requirements that may validate the need for deploying a wireless network
is the future growth of the factory or factory network and the need for more communications devices
throughout. This requirement is mapped into the scalability of the candidate networks. For each candidate,
the scalability aspects must be discussed including the capacity of the network, ease of network expansion,
and the ability to satisfy future growth.
Power Management – The power management requirements are obtained using factory knowledge
resulting from the factory site survey. A simple and important example is identification of power sources,
types, and locations across the factory. Battery-operated devices use low power for transmission and should
have a predictable maintenance schedule for battery replacement. For continuously powered nodes, cabling
requirements and structure should be studied and the existing power sources must be defined. Moreover,
the power-efficiency of the wireless network should be considered depending on data delivery cost. To
quantify power-efficiency, a power analysis of each candidate should be performed to include the number
of components, required performance levels, power management schemes, and battery life.
Reliability – Another topic to be considered based on the factory requirements of various applications is
the required reliability of the wireless network. That includes the plan of the network to transfer data in
situations when the wireless channels are poor. Also, the acceptable off-time of the wireless network has to
be defined. Reliability can be measured by the response of the wireless network to various effects. These
effects include the RF spectrum usage, the RF agility, the interference immunity, and system power
variations such as output power and receiver sensitivity. Moreover, reliability includes various requirements
on data delivery including acceptable latency and errors.

23

Simplicity – Simplicity can be considered in two perspectives. First, the simplicity of the wireless network
setup includes the ease of the design, development, and implementation of the wireless network. In this
perspective, the candidate wireless networks are considered from the viewpoint of components, tools, and
technologies. Programmable components are preferred to allow for more flexibility in designing,
implementing, and tuning the wireless network. Second, the simplicity of the wireless network used
includes the ease of device activation, network support, monitoring, and tuning of the wireless network.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Range – The expected maximum distance between nodes in the wireless networks should be defined.
Range is based on the link budget between any two nodes on a wireless network. Extending the effective
range of a network can be accomplished by adjusting power, using a directional antenna, or adding
additional nodes to a network to compensate and then deploying routing capabilities which may increase
complexity, cost, and power consumption.
Maintainability – During the lifetime of a wireless network, nodes will need both emergency and regular
maintenance. The ease of performing these tasks determines the level of maintainability of a candidate
wireless solution. It includes both hardware and software maintenance to include part replacement, software
upgrades, and reconfigurations. In the case of software maintainability, the user interface and the network
management software should be user-friendly.
Interoperability – Due to different applications and functionality, various communications protocols can
operate simultaneously; however, those protocols may be incompatible. For factory networks to
interoperate, their communications protocols must be compatible and easy to use or adapt. In a wireless
sensor network, sensors may report their process information which is transmitted to a gateway. That
information is not usable until it can be retrieved by another application such as a PLC program or
optimization application. For that to happen, the gateway needs to communicate the information in
language (i.e., a protocol) that can be understood. For an example, automation applications have
traditionally used Modbus for localized communications between nodes such as a sensing unit and PLC.
This allows users to extract the data. Modbus, while easy to implement and quite ubiquitous, lacks language
and context that other modern protocols provide.
4.3.1.3 Safety and Security
Although safety and security are part of the factory and network considerations, they have been discussed
in a separate subsection due to their importance in protecting data, personnel, and factory assets. Safety and
security are discussed in more details in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.
Generally, the levels of required security against malicious attacks for different applications are diverse.
Hence, for each candidate wireless network, the level of achieved security and types of security systems
must be considered. Also, if using multiple wireless networks, the approach of security in these networks
must be considered and whether to use multiple systems that will be managed separately. Security can be
divided into three basic categories which are integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
The use of wireless networks in safety applications is primarily motivated by cost, mobility, and ruggedness
considerations that wired solutions cannot accommodate. Wireless connections cannot be physically
damaged although it can be argued that interference is a form of physical interruption. On the other hand,
safety applications requirements can be very strict regarding latency, reliability, and robustness. As a result,
while considering candidate systems for safety applications, requirements for these systems should be
strictly enforced. The deployed network must always comply with regulatory concerns.
4.3.1.4 Approval Requirements
Determine if the candidates need specific regulatory or external approvals for operation. This includes
approvals from entities such as the FCC or other internal governance structure such as a spectrum

24

management group. Also, safety approvals should be considered, such as intrinsic safety ratings, for every
wireless node. Hence, a set of acceptable nodes can only be used at certain locations. All internal and
external regulatory approvals should be enumerated.
4.3.1.5 Training Requirements
Each candidate will have unique training needs. These training requirements should be identified based on
the experience of personnel using the technology. Moreover, the training details should be determined such
as how training will be conducted and how knowledge will be disseminated throughout the organization.
These training requirements should be defined to handle all installation, operation, and maintenance
activities.

4.3.2 Candidate Evaluation and Comparison
Once the requirements and available options are identified, the evaluation and comparison of the possible
candidates will help to select the appropriate solution. By enumerating the technical requirements
comprehensively, each candidate can be assessed impartially according to the requirements and assigned
weights. If it is helpful to do so, a scoring system that summates the weights of compliant requirements
can be adopted by the assessment team in selecting candidate solutions. In addition, where requirements
are validated through testing, additional weight for those requirements can be applied. This approach gives
advantage to solutions that have been independently tested.
4.3.2.1 Identify the Candidates
After establishing all the network requirements, the following step is to identify the potential candidates.
As mentioned previously, candidate identification can occur in parallel to the requirements gathering
process. The candidates are found through normal channels of internet searches, vendor consultation,
discussions with systems integrators, and datasheets. Industrial communications experts and consultants
are good sources for identifying candidates as their experience and knowledge of application scenarios and
deployment tuning can be helpful. Forums, conferences, and industry shows are good ways of identifying
candidates and capabilities.
4.3.2.2 Candidate Requirements Matrix
A candidate requirements matrix (CRM) such as the example given in Appendix A-4 is generated. The
CRM contains a list of requirements, weights and priorities, and a list of the identified candidates. By
enumerating the quantitative and qualitative requirements, it is then possible to capture requirements
compliance. List all the requirements atomically. A measurable specification for each atomic requirement
should be recorded in the table. A weighting factor is assigned for each requirement with a value between
0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates the most important or highest priority; whereas, a value less than 1 assigns
a lower level of importance. A requirement should not have a value of 0, as that indicates that it is not a
requirement.
4.3.2.3 Validate Requirements and Capabilities
At this point, all candidates are assessed for each requirement independently. Some requirements can be
satisfied through analysis of datasheets or performance reports from similar systems. Other requirements
will require verification by testing within the operating environment of the factory. Validation of a
requirement by analysis or by testing will be determined by the selection team. It is important in this
validation process to test various system capabilities included in Section 4.3.1.2 such as the integration with
existing industrial hardware and running applications, and the performance of the system with the existing
level of traffic over the RF spectrum and while the plant is in operation. It is also important to allow the
wireless system to run for a period of time based on the applications to make sure it works seamlessly.
Tools such as simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbeds are valuable resources to leverage for

25

assessing highly important or high-risk requirements. The results of each validation should be captured in
the CRM according to some pre-defined rubric such as the weight scoring system discussed previously.
4.3.2.4 Rank, Compare, and Choose
At this point, a completed CRM has been generated. Those candidates that do not meet the absolute
requirements are eliminated. Those candidates that remain will then be compared quantitatively by
recording the scores for each candidate. The candidate with the highest score will be selected. This process
is illustrated with the candidate scoring matrix in Appendix A-4.

Solution Design

At this stage of building the industrial wireless solution, the best
candidate has been selected and it is the time to specify the
network architecture, wireless system parameters, and wireless
node locations, and validate the capabilities of the solution design.
The steps of obtaining the systems design can be listed as
planning, analysis, design, simulation, and optimization.

Quality of Service

The planning phase includes the frequency planning and the
corresponding regulatory and internal approvals. Frequency
planning includes channel selection and management. An RF

hypothetical transmitter and receiver locations. Results of a QoS
study are helpful in selecting locations for network infrastructure
and conducting simulations when necessary. The network design phase includes the wireless network
architecture, topology selection, and node placement. Many network design aspects can be defined before
measurement and analysis but may need to be updated after an analysis of the QoS measurements are
available.
Simulation is a good tool for reducing risk associated with complex designs or scenarios involving wireless
supervisory or feedback control. Simulation can be useful in predicting performance of a wireless system
before a major deployment investment is made. Based on simulation results, final tuning of the design
parameters can be performed before deployment.
4.4.1 Frequency Planning and Approvals
During the candidate selection, the operating frequency band of the wireless solution is determined. First,
approvals for the use of a certain frequency band need to be obtained as explained in the following
subsection. Then, frequency planning should be performed including the study of channel utilization and
interference effects, and identification of coverage cells and access points.
During channel utilization, the initiated traffic from each physical point is evaluated based on the physical
process requirements. The bandwidth requirement for each connection is determined based on traffic over
this connection. It is advisable, if testing can be performed, to verify these calculations. The coverage level
and networking connectivity at a certain work space is determined based on total amount transferred data.
Depending on the technology used, the number of channels required to cover the work space is determined
following the general concept of frequency reuse in various coverage regions.
Using the spectrum survey to identify interference levels, the received signal quality can be estimated to
evaluate the requirements for achieving the calculated rate. Finally, the access points requirements are
defined to carry traffic between nodes in a coverage region and to carry traffic to other network locations.
Furthermore, various applications are considered during this phase including instrumentation, voice, video,

26

backhaul, and safety applications.
In most of the cases, different
technologies will be deployed for
different applications. However, the
frequency planning should be done
over all the wireless systems.

4.4.2 Regulatory Approvals
Some radio bands require FCC
licensing approval before use.
Licensed frequencies should be
strongly considered in applications
where safety is an issue such as
lifting with overhead cranes where
Figure 10. Example of a QoS Heat Map
exclusive use of frequencies
minimizes the probability of interference and hence a safer operation is achieved. When FCC licensing is
required, start the application process early to ensure timely approval, or to provide time to develop
alternative solutions if the license application is declined. For frequencies that are not licensed by the FCC,
it may be necessary for a manufacturing company to seek approval from an internal governance board to
ensure harmonious operations on those frequencies.
4.4.3 Quality of Service Analysis
Conducting a site survey will provide information about how RF transmissions will propagate through the
factory given hypothetical transmission points. RF transmissions propagate through the air and will lose
power with distance in accordance with a rate of loss. This rate of power loss is influenced by the amount
and type of materials present in the environment and the RF band of interest. Radio waves behave
differently at 900 MHz than they do at 2.4 GHz or 60 GHz.
Some materials such as steel will reflect RF transmissions creating reflections and a reverberation effect,
while other materials such as concrete absorb RF. Reverberation will spread the RF energy over time.
While total power is less diminished in a reverberant environment, the time spreading can cause significant
distortions and result in data loss and delay. In some cases, reflections can be used to the advantage of the
network if distortion is not severe. Most indoor factories fall into the absorptive category. In an absorptive
environment, RF transmissions are significantly diminished, but distortion due to time spreading is
measurably less.
By identifying potential access points, a coverage map, also called a “heat map,” as shown in Figure 10
may be produced that gives an indication of expected quality of service (QoS). A coverage map will provide
a graphical perspective about how RF energy permeates the factory environment if locations of wireless
infrastructure are known. An RF coverage map can be costly but helpful when attempting to predict through
simulation or link budgeting the quality of service for a candidate wireless technology. Each wireless
technology has different capabilities. Differences in type and grade of the device matters. A high-end and
more expensive wireless device may have a distance that is an order of magnitude better than a less capable
device; however, the performance difference may be reflected in the price. Therefore, a heat map provides
some perspective of performance, but it should not be used as the single indicator. Overly uniform heat
maps may be an indication of faulty measurements or that the simulation was too simplistic. Moreover, the
physical factory environment can be very dynamic and the RF characteristic will reflect those changes.
Prior to conducting an RF site survey which implies selection of a candidate has been conducted, it is
suggested to validate performance of a network during candidate selection using the physical equipment
rather than try to predict performance.

27

Alternatively, NIST performed a high-fidelity propagation analysis of three indoor factory facilities.
During this study, NIST measured power loss and delay spread of RF transmissions in three factories. The
results of the study were published in NIST Technical Note TN-1951[14]. By using technical information
provided in this study, it is possible to predict wireless network performance given transmit power, the
sensitivity of the receiving devices, and the nature of the communication channel, i.e., whether the channel
is considered line-of-sight (LOS) or non-line-of-sight (NLOS). Strong RF signals are not a definitive
indicator of high quality of service within a harsh industrial environment where multi-path reflections
dominate. Certainly, signal-to-noise ratio is an important factor, but reflections off factory walls and
equipment and the category of the wireless channel (i.e., LOS and NLOS) can dominate performance of
the wireless network[15]. If a QoS Survey is impractical, this report can serve as a benchmark for how
radio transmissions will behave in a factory environment.
4.4.4 Frequency Harmonization
Harmonization of the RF spectrum is an essential step in managing the performance and allocation of the
spectral resources within the factory. Depending on the size and nature of the factory operation,
management of the spectral resources can be critical to the availability of the wireless networks. The
following are practical consideration in harmonization of the RF spectrum within a factory.
FCC Licensing – Obtaining a license from the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
to obtain the exclusive rights to a specific frequency in a well-defined geographic area.
Channelization – Assigning a specific channel within a frequency band to a specific device or wireless
network, and allowing no other device to share that channel within the device’s operating distance. This is
applied where dependability and speed are paramount such as safety situations.
Multiplexing – Allowing multiple users to share a frequency using techniques such as time division, code
division, phase shifting, and others. This is usually applied where there are many users and performance is
less critical.
Proximity – Using low power devices at short distances between transmitter and receiver. This concept is
applied where close proximity is practical and the impact of interference is minimal.
Pairing – Coupling a specific transmitter and specific receiver using identity codes.
Matching – Similar to pairing, but using groups of transmitters and groups of receivers so that any receiver
in the group can work with any transmitter in the group.
Data Filtering – Applicable to handling the problem of “data flooding” when a passive Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) transceiver picks up tag data from different RFID usage domains. The filtering is
sometimes included as a part of the RFID application software.
4.4.5 Topology and Node Placement
Some wireless networks allow for the selection of a topology. For example, ISA100.11a allows for the
selection of mesh network and star topologies. Mesh and star both have strengths and weaknesses, for
example in reliability and latency. To select the best topology for a wireless network, various aspects are
considered such as the scalability, mobility, security, infrastructure, and the intended use of the wireless
nodes. A brittle topology can create squeeze points in the network, placing a burden on one or more nodes,
taxing battery life, and creating points of failure. The use of a certain topology can limit the number of
nodes and the coverage of a wireless network. Hence, the expected growth of the wireless network
determines the required number of access points and their coverage. Moreover, node mobility determines
the need for roaming within the plant and the required speed for this roaming. Changes in the physical

28

factory environment can occur, and where these changes can be anticipated, it is recommended to add
routing or hand-off points such that service is not interrupted.
The processing needed for various security aspects determines the need of high processing nodes within
each coverage area or that simple wireless nodes are enough to achieve the required security needs.
Moreover, the existing infrastructure availability may make it easier to use a star topology, for example.
Finally, amount of traffic generated or handled by a wireless node can also help in selecting a topology. As
an example, field nodes with low data rates are commonly connected in a star topology to aggregate data
before forwarding to the more congested parts of the network. Another example is back-haul nodes where
point-to-point high data rate links are commonly used.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

It is recommended that engineers consult vendor
documentation. Vendors and service providers will often
provide systems engineering guides that will help the designer
to optimize the reliability of their network by providing bestpractice guidance on node placement, the number of
gateways, and device configuration (e.g., routing or nonrouting).

Use vendor systems
engineering guides
when available.

4.4.6 Simulation
Simulation is a good tool for reducing risk associated with complex designs or scenarios involving wireless
supervisory or feedback control. Simulation allows for performance of the wireless system to be assessed
before a major deployment investment is made. The accuracy of the simulation will rely on the fidelity of
the model used. A high-fidelity model will produce more accurate results that match the real world;
however, such accurate simulations require detailed knowledge of the radio environment and network
behavior. Testing with actual equipment can be a more effective means of assessing performance; but
simulation can be used to identify risk of the fully deployed system and is better suited for optimization
than is trial-and-error network design. During network simulations, various networking performance
metrics should be considered. These network aspects have been discussed in Section 4.3.1.2 where the
system parameters are optimized to achieve the required performance levels. Furthermore, the node
placement and network structure including the need of relays and their placement are investigated during
these simulations.
For wireless systems involving feedback control or critical

requirements necessary for critical systems functions.
with real hardware.
Wireless networks are installed to achieve certain objectives
in the industrial environment. To tune the design parameters
and validate the ability of the wireless network to achieve
these objectives, cyber-physical systems simulations should be used to predict performance. Simulations
should include failure modes such as power loss to devices and infrastructure, RF interference, and changes
in the physical environment that will lead to increased attenuation, signal loss, or exacerbated multi-path.
Simulations that combine both a network and the physical model are often referred to as a co-simulation.
Many tools exist for conducting simulations; however, co-simulations require effort to combine the physical
simulator with the network simulator. When conducting a co-simulation, a model for the physical process
is needed which can be generally simplified to virtually represent the process rate, inputs, and outputs.
Moreover, the system dynamics and control algorithms are included to model the wireless network effects
on the control loops. Furthermore, the interfaces between the physical system and the wireless network
should be modeled including the difference in timing behaviors of both systems.

29

Simulation is a useful tool for verifying a network design or developing an optimal solution, but it should
be used with caution and is better validated through testing. When wireless is used for control of an
industrial system, testing should be an integral part of the design process.

necessary, cybersecurity event detection, and physical
environment monitoring. Using data from monitoring and
analysis, it is possible to make improvements to the network over time, extend the network, and tune the
system such that performance is improved. Updating and Optimization is a process of continuous
improvement. Continuous improvement will come from understanding the network and any considerations
such as antenna position, frequency allocations, interference, and loading that may degrade network
performance over time. Wireless networks operate very similar to wired networks with the main difference
being the nature of the wireless medium through which communication is conducted.
4.5.1 Deployment
During Deployment, the wireless network hardware and software are installed and tested to achieve the
designed performance levels. Proper antenna installation assures the delivery of wireless transmissions over
the network. While technological capabilities of existing products may lead to specific technical
requirements of the deployment, this section focuses on the general wireless networking aspects of
deployment. Moreover, training on operating and managing the wireless network is essential at this stage
to prevent any loss in performance due to human errors. The expected result of this phase is a fully
operational wireless network which implements the intended design.
4.5.1.1 Antenna Positioning and Orientation
One major consideration in a wireless deployment is the placement of the antennas for each device. Antenna
placement includes antenna positioning and orientation. In general, it is best to position the antennas of
each device with clear visibility to the other devices to which it will connect. This can be achieved by
placing antennas at high positions above machinery and other obstructions. One drawback to a higher
antenna position is that it may increase the cable distance between the antenna and the wireless device.
Increased cable distance will lead to increased transmit power loss and reduced receiver sensitivity.
Installation according to manufacturer instructions and specifications will usually lead to optimal

30

performance; however, it is important
for the installer to be aware of the
limitations on antenna cable
extensions.
Conversely, placing
antennas close to the ground will
introduce more power loss with
distance and should be avoided. It is
generally more advisable to incur
cable losses to achieve appropriate
antenna height than to position an
antenna close to the ground.

truly omni-directional. In fact, these
types of antennas radiate outward
with a toroidal pattern with a polarity that is parallel to the orientation of the antenna. Positioning such
antennas high up on a ceiling will degrade performance of the wireless network. Common flat “pancakestyle” Wi-Fi antennas are examples of sideways radiators. Although they appear to radiate downward, they
radiate outward from the edges. Positioning such antennas high up will result in poor network performance
unless the antenna pattern is designed to radiate downward and outward. Knowing the radiation pattern of
any antenna is an important aspect in positioning an antenna.
4.5.1.2 Antenna Characteristics
As mentioned in the previous section, a crucial aspect during the deployment phase of the wireless network
is the selection of antenna characteristics to match antenna placement and performance requirements.
Considerations include antenna type, radiation pattern, and the number of antennas also called antenna
diversity. The first major selection step is between omni-directional antennas and directional antennas.
Omni-directional antennas are selected when the node can be connected to various nodes in various
directions through the network operation. Conversely, directional antennas achieve better performance if
the direction of the transmissions is fixed. Directional antennas can be electronically or mechanically
steered. Electronic steering is not usually required for stationary deployments but is very useful for mobile
applications. Omni-directional antennas are most useful for mesh style networks; whereas, directional
antennas are more useful for microwave links and other long-haul connections. Directional antennas are
also useful for device deployment on the perimeter of a factory. Assuming a well-designed model, the
antenna will then be considered the most important contributor to establishing an effective link margin.
Therefore, selecting an antenna with the appropriate characteristics for the position of the deployment is
paramount for an effective operation.

31

4.5.1.3 Configuration Verification
Often the wireless network is deployed by a
team different than those who designed the
system. Therefore, a process for verifying
that the network was deployed according to
design intent is required. This would include
visual inspection of installed devices and
cables, as well as inspection of configuration
and provisioning of the network equipment.

4.5.1.4 Establish Line-of-Sight (LOS) Links
The existence of an unobstructed LOS
between wireless nodes improves the
performance significantly. This is primarily
a result of the LOS component of the
transmission as seen by the receiver

from objects in the factory. When a LOS
component is missing, path loss between
Figure 12. LOS links in a mesh network
transmitter and receiver will increase
significantly. The resulting multi-path reflection will distort the signal resulting in link reliability problems.
As a result, it is highly recommended to establish a LOS communication link between each transmitter and
receiver. For mesh networks, this is not usually possible or necessary; however, within a mesh network at
least one LOS link should exist for each transmitter and at least one LOS route should exist between each
transmitter and the centralized gateway devices if gateways exist. This is shown in Figure 12 where device
X communicates with a complete LOS route to the gateway through its LOS counterpart, device C. It may
be possible to communicate through nodes A and B effectively. One caveat to this general rule is that
device C should have the resources (i.e., bandwidth, power, and processing speed) to accommodate the
added load of the traffic from device X. It is important to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations
when establishing LOS connectivity and an effective network topology.
4.5.1.5 Black-box Test Methods
Factory operators, system integrators, and control systems designers are rarely experts in wireless
communications systems. Considerations such as electromagnetic propagation, antenna efficiency, path
loss exponents, packet error rates, and medium access are often foreign concepts to factory engineers. When
available, link quality metrics such as packet loss ratios are informative but can be difficult to understand
with complex mesh architectures and routing algorithms. The control system design will only need to know
the statistical distribution of latency and reliability of information through the network to design a controller
that is robust. Therefore, it is recommended that black-box tests be conducted for each installed device.
Black-box tests are those types of tests that do not require internal performance metrics from the wireless
device. Instead, black-box tests allow for performance evaluation using live process signals to measure
reliability and latency. It is possible to construct black-box test harnesses; however, having network devices
and infrastructure such as the PLC that support black-box tests makes evaluation much easier for the factory
engineer.
4.5.1.6 Personnel Training on Network Operation
The operating personnel of the wireless network need to be trained on setup, administrating, and monitoring
of the network. A certification process should be well defined to ensure the ability of personnel in

32

performing the required networking tasks. The use of network diagnostic tools is another major task to
deploy and maintain the network to be able to get the most out of the installed network.

4.5.1.7 Personnel Training on General Awareness of Wireless Networks
Wireless technology pervades everyday personal life. Employees operate cell phones and other personal
electronic devices. These devices can interfere with the operation of the factory network as the employees
may not be aware of the impacts of using their personal devices within the factory. To lessen the impact of
personal devices on the factory network, it is recommended that employees are trained with a general
knowledge of how wireless networks function and how personal devices can impact the performance of the
factory network. For example, employees may bring cell phones with Wi-Fi hotspots turned on which can
be disruptive. Another example could include proactive employees using personal walkie-talkies to be
more productive or safe and disrupt the operation of a factory network in the process. Finally, educating
employees about keeping microwave ovens clean can lessen EM leakage from the ovens and thereby lessen
the impact to the factory wireless network.
4.5.1.8 Bring Your Own Device Policy
Another important aspect when designing a wireless solution is building or updating the bring your own
device (BYOD) policy. This policy introduces the industrial environment regulations for using employees’
own devices. The focus here is about wireless devices because of the interference and security issues that
may be caused as a result of using these devices in the work environment.
Generally, certain work areas at which safety wireless signals are transmitted must have exclusive bands
usage for the safety applications that may lead, in some scenarios, to restrict the usage of personal devices
totally. A certain private wireless network may restrict device connection establishment to work nonpersonal devices. Moreover, certain types of wireless may be prohibited either due to their power level or
continuous data transmission that may cause unacceptable interference.
4.5.2 Monitoring and Analysis
The operational wireless network is continually
monitored to keep track of various parameters
related to the network performance. Network
monitoring includes continual monitoring of the
EM spectrum, the performance of the network,
the security state of the network and physical
factory process, and the physical environment
that impacts EM propagation.

4.5.2.1 Spectrum Monitoring
Spectrum monitoring is performed in various stages while building a wireless network. It is performed
initially within the site survey and later through the design stage where spectrum monitoring is performed
while testing the designed network. During network operation, continual spectrum monitoring is
recommended. A robust spectrum monitoring solution will include spectrum analytics, ability to correlate
the spectral activity to factory activities, trends and prediction of spectrum usage, spectrum anomaly
detection, geolocation of interference, and reporting. A spectrum monitoring solution will provide a
complete situational awareness picture of the RF bands used by the factory operation and the interference
patterns that could impact factory operation. In fact, it is possible that the spectrum monitoring solution be
integrated with factory automation features such as PLCs.

4.5.2.2 Network Monitoring
Network monitoring is important as it includes various nodes’ status, traffic patterns, routes, and statistics,
link health and errors, and network topology. A network monitoring solution is usually used to monitor and
analyze various network aspects. First, various nodes of the network are monitored to ensure that each one
is active and correctly connected to intended nodes in the network. Backup nodes also may be checked to
confirm availability for operating if needed. Various nodes are checked periodically through test messages
and data exchange between nodes. Network monitoring will support factory engineers in assessing the
location of bottlenecks, sources of data surges, hop patterns, and other considerations. It will also help
engineers to assess if wireless devices need to be replaced, repaired, or adjusted, especially if a change in
the environment has degraded performance. Many network monitoring tools exist in both open source and
commercially. It is recommended that the product used is selected based on customization requirements
and in-house knowledge of networking in general.
4.5.2.3 Security Monitoring
To monitor the network security status, statistics about the packet errors, failures, timeouts, and successes
are evaluated. Like spectrum monitoring and network monitoring, security monitoring is a consideration
that can be addressed through third-party products and solutions. Security monitoring will allow for the
detection of abnormal network events such as unauthorized access, rogue devices, and suspicious network
behavior that deviates from expected behavior. Security monitoring tools will provide deep-packet
inspection and traffic pattern anomaly detection. The security monitoring feature may come as an option
or feature of a network monitor or wireless product, or it might be a standalone feature such as wireless
sniffers. The list of security products in both the open source and commercial domain is vast. A security
monitoring product should be easy to use, support the protocols used within the factory, and integrate well
within existing factory networks and reporting tools. For wireless networks, security monitoring could be
built into the wireless devices or exist independent of the industrial operation. Wireless traffic sniffers exist
and must be configured with the authentication materials of the operational network to be useful.
4.5.2.4 Environment Monitoring
The surroundings of wireless nodes will have a large impact on their performance. Therefore, stacking or
moving of materials through the wireless links must be monitored. Metal as an example is highly reflective
and can change wireless link behavior. Different materials may have different effects on the performance
and hence monitoring is required to avoid scenarios where the planned wireless links change greatly
because of the surrounding environment. Any intended change in the environment or configuration of the
factory should undergo normal factory change management procedures. Change management procedures
should include the possible performance impact to wireless networks.
4.5.3 Updates and Optimization
In an operational system, various network settings may
need to be adjusted over time. Software and firmware
may need to be updated, or the network may need to be
extended. Continuous maintenance and optimization
includes
accommodating
network
extensions,
performing software and firmware updates, and making
antenna and power adjustments to wireless devices.

4.5.3.1 Network Extension
One of the major advantages of using wireless networks is the scalability of the network where new nodes
can be added to the network conveniently. Often in an industrial network, the infrastructural components
to the network are installed first and the devices themselves are later deployed. This is a common
deployment style for industrial wireless mesh networks such as ISA100 Wireless and WirelessHART. By

34

installing the infrastructure components first in such network types, the aggregator nodes can be placed to
maximum coverage over the facility. Devices can then be added to the network as needed by the
instrumentation, automation components, and data collection facilities.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

In industrial mesh networks, the number of nodes allowed to connect to an access point is limited. When
adding more nodes to a network, wireless resource allocation should be reviewed and revised accordingly
to accommodate additional traffic. Testing of the network performance after extension is then required to
verify the correct operation. However, adding a new node while the network is in operation must be done
without a negative impact to the operational network. In a well-planned network, maximum throughput and
network size are designed to accommodate new devices. In a time-division multiple access (TDMA) mesh
network, gateway placement, topology, and scheduling are all designed with growth in mind. Therefore,
when extending the network with new nodes, the device will only need to be physically installed with
appropriate antenna placement, provisioned, and then powered on.
Whenever possible, simulation is a tool that can be used to validate a new design that will be added to the
deployed system. Especially for feedback and supervisory control systems using wireless communication,
simulation could be an essential step in avoiding a potential problem. It is high recommended to use
simulation for wirelessly controlled system before any deployment.
When extending the network, all aspects of the wireless lifecycle can be repeated at a smaller scale including
testing for performance, assessing the increased interference, and monitoring for traffic patterns and
network topology. Afterwards, network parameter tuning and optimization can be performed on the new
devices and the overall network to accommodate the new devices.
4.5.3.2 Software and Firmware Updates
Various network devices need firmware updates to fix discovered bugs, patch security holes, make
performance enhancements, and add new features. Periodic checking for the availability of the updates is
recommended; however, automatic installation of updates is not recommended. Before applying any update
to software or firmware, the update must be validated through testing first before rolling out to the deployed
network. Steps involved with rolling out updates to software and firmware include the following:
•
•
•
•

Extensive testing of the update within a controlled environment
Configuration management of the existing system with roll-back capability
Deployment plan developed and approved according to internal governance policies
Authorization of the update through internal governance policies

An operational factory system is very different from a typical non-operational office system. Application
of software or firmware updates to the wireless network or any component with in the factory operation
could result in downtime. It is highly recommended that all updates are thoroughly researched and tested
before deployment.
4.5.3.3 Power Adjustments and Reporting Rate Tuning
Tuning the transmission power of wireless nodes allows for less interference and more control of nodes
associating with other network nodes. Increased transmit power is not necessarily an improvement.
Increasing transmit power can lead to better performance for one device on a network, but it can also lead
to shorter battery life. Increased transmit power may also lower performance of other devices on adjacent
wireless networks using the same RF band. A different approach to tuning transmit power is to develop a
link budget and maintaining a defined link margin to accommodate unexpected interference or a change in
the environment. Developing a link budget for each device is a common method for accomplishing this
task; however, many wireless systems will employ automatic power control which adjusts transmit power

35

to reach quality of service thresholds but without disadvantaging other devices or shortening battery life.
Power adjustments account for regulations that limit the radiated power from an antenna.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Report rate tuning is the process for setting the transmission rate for a given device. The reporting rate will
determine how often process variables that are monitored by a network device are transmitted. A high
reporting will result in more transmissions and more bandwidth and battery utilization. If the rate is set to
be too high, other wireless device transmissions may fail, and, if the reporting rate is set to be too low, the
assigned bandwidth will be wasted. Reporting rates should be set according to the process design
requirements. Later adjustments should be made in accordance with new process requirements or network
reliability requirements which are usually derived from process requirements. Rate adaptation is usually
accomplished through manual intervention; however, automatic reporting rates can be applied to adjust to
conditions within the factory and the wireless network.

WIRELESS FOR SAFETY

Wireless systems may be useful to enhancing the safety profile within a factory operation. These systems
can be used to prevent injury through improved communication and enhanced situational awareness within
the factory. Wireless safety systems are used in many applications including those designed to prevent
chemical handling mishaps, avoid heavy equipment accidents such as “struck-by, and back-over” incidents,
prevent falls through active position monitoring and safety interconnects, provide situational awareness
within confined spaces, and improve safety for non-employees.
Along with adaption of wireless sensor networks for industrial automation, there are more applications of
wireless technology created by users after they are more familiar and comfortable with the wireless
technology. Also because of the strong benefits of wireless applications that can save project execution
time and cost, more and more wireless has been used for secondary or backup systems for time-critical
application such as safety or control applications. Based on this movement, ISA-84 working group (WG)
8 developed a technical report on wireless for safety systems other than those of a safety integrated system
(SIS), i.e., those systems with a system integrity level (SIL) rating below ten. The technical report describes
the additional elements needed to be addressed when wireless technology is used in an Independent
Protection Layer (IPL). Refer to the ISA technical report TR84.00.08-2017 Guidance for Application of
Wireless Sensor Technology to Non-SIS Independent Protection Layers for more information[13].

INDUSTRIAL WIRELESS SECURITY

Industrial control systems (ICS) cybersecurity is a branch of general cybersecurity in which the systems
being protected have physical characteristics which if compromised can lead to down-time, injury or death,
and economic loss. Industrial control systems include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
systems, localized work-cells, enterprise control systems, and cloud-based factory collection systems.
Traditional information technology (IT) systems differ from operational technology (OT) systems primarily
in their cybersecurity priorities. In general, IT systems defend against data extractions. Encryption used to
provide confidentiality is of primary concern. In OT systems, confidentiality is no longer of paramount
concern. While eavesdropping can lead to reverse engineering of proprietary factory methods and design,
it is usually more important to keep the factory running. Therefore, technologies must assure that both
cybersecurity controls and cyber-attack do not limit or prevent the capability of the factory running with
high availability. Table 7 lists the priorities of IT and OT systems. It is important for IT professionals to
recognize that wireless security practices used in the office may not be available for factory deployments.
If they are available, they may not be desirable to maintain system availability. Securing the industrial
network can be summarized in the following considerations: Secure the physical environment; Secure the
end-points; Secure the controller; and Secure network transmissions/data. Industrial wireless networks

36

have the same consideration as wired networks with the addition of protecting the electromagnetic spectrum
allocated for the industrial wireless network operation.

The number of devices connecting to industrial networks is increasing at a rapid rate. It exposes systems to
security breaches and cyberattacks. As a result, security is paramount for industrial operations. Some
manufacturers think wireless will create new vulnerabilities in the network that may result in potential
threats. Just making the wireless network accessible through a password is not adequate. One key concern
is how to identity and eliminate rogue access points. Therefore, wireless intrusion detection systems and
intrusion prevention systems are in demand.
In addition, isolation of production devices on a separate network from corporate networks, internet traffic,
and phone and surveillance systems is necessary. In other words, one can employ an “island” approach to
networking that limits the movement of traffic and devices between islands. By properly segmenting a
network, it can limit movement between networks to appropriate devices and block the movement of
devices that are unnecessary or provide little value.

6.1 Practical Considerations
Plant operators should follow manufacturer guidance for security where it does not conflict with recognized
guidance and best-practices.
Ease of Implementation – Make securing wireless deployments easy to implement and maintain
Physical security – Physically protect wireless access points, gateways, modems, and devices
Default security – Auto-configure network devices to the highest security level by default
Updates – Securely update software, firmware, and data over-the-air or wire and disable automatic updates
Share and Report – Share security threat data, perform analytics, and continually learn about security
Trust – Form a network of digital trust and protect data and privacy as practical and possible.
Full life-cycle – Securely operate the network across the entire lifecycle from product development through
deployment
Passwords – Do not use default passwords once the system is installed; protect passwords; authenticate
users; enforce password change policies
Zones and Conduits – Separate industrial networks into zones and conduits and separate the industrial
network from the enterprise office network; apply policies to industrial networks separate from the
enterprise network (refer to IEC 62443[3])
Spectrum Monitoring – Use spectrum monitoring to gain awareness of normal versus abnormal wireless
activity

37

Network Monitoring – Monitor the industrial network continually and non-intrusively without
compromising factory operations

6.2 Security Assessments, Reporting, and Training
The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) was established to maintain
a database of security incidents, share mitigation methods, and provide training and tools for assessing risk
within an ICS. If a security incident does occur, it is recommended that the incident be reported to ICSCERT. The ICS-CERT home page may be found at https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/.

BEST PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS

7.1 Antenna Placement and the Fresnel Distance

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

When setting up antennas, if possible be certain to maintain a direct line-of-sight (LOS) path between each
transmitter and receiver that are intended to communicate together. Even in a mesh network in which multihop communications is intended, each hop should be designed to have LOS. Some devices are designed to
accommodate non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications; however, LOS is preferable to maximize
reliability and reduce delay from retransmissions. In addition, obstructions such as those shown in the tank
farm in Figure 13 should be kept well out of the LOS path to avoid diffractive effects. A good rule of
thumb to optimize performance in this case is to calculate the first Fresnel zone distance, F1, and assure that
objects do not come within that radius from the mid-point of the LOS path. The first Fresnel zone is
calculated as F1   d1d2 / (d1  d2 ) where the wavelength   c / f . Distances are in meters. The
constant, c , is the speed of light, which is 3 108 meters per second, and f is the transmit frequency in
Hz. In an indoor facility, obtaining the clearance is not always possible and will not usually become a root
cause of serious link degradation. It should also be noted that the Fresnel zone equation is a function of
distance and wavelength. Lower frequency bands will convert to larger wavelengths and, therefore, have
larger Fresnel clearances. This has implications for densely populated indoor facilities in that lower
frequency RF deployments will not always perform better than higher-frequency deployments due to
Fresnel clearance as it would in a less dense outdoor installation. Testing of devices before final deployment
will confirm that performance requirements will be met.

7.2 Obstructions and Path Redundancy
Shadowing occurs when an object causes an electromagnetic blockage like a shadow caused by visible
light. Both visible light and RF waves are forms of electromagnetic radiation in the form of waves or
photons. An RF shadow is therefore a deep attenuation of the electromagnetic energy in a specific region
caused when RF waves are blocked. For example, when a large object, such as a commercial jetliner, rolls
into an area and sufficiently blocks the direct path between transmitter and receiver, the link between the
two may be lost. In many circumstances, diffraction and multipath will serve to overcome a blockage of
the direct path with an increase in data loss or delay. Often the transmitted signal is attenuated beyond
signal recovery and another solution is required to maintain quality of service requirements.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

The solution depends entirely on the wireless network being deployed and the minimum requirements for
the applications using the wireless network. One option includes transmitting from a different location.
This is often possible using lightweight access points in IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.4 networks; however,
hand-off from one access point to the other can be too slow. Other options include a multi-hop solution as
shown in Figure 14. Using a multi-hop solution could require anticipating the blockage and planning for
an alternate fixed communication path or redundant path. Another solution would use a more active form
of a mesh network in which nodes within the network maintain constant awareness of link quality and act
accordingly. An IEEE 802.11 network that uses OSI layer 2 metrics can respond faster to changes in the
environment than one that uses layer 3 metrics; however every networking technology has different
capabilities. The key concept here is the use of transmission path redundancy to improve the resilience of
the network to changes in the environment. Use path redundancy to improve network reliability within an
environment where the RF characteristics can change. Most industrial environments fall into this category
to some degree. Many wireless systems support path diversity, and including ISA100 Wireless,
WirelessHART, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and proprietary solutions.

7.3 Difficult-To-Reach Locations

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Narrow corridors, tight spaces, areas occluded with machines, and applications low to the ground make
wireless connectivity difficult. Many industrial applications require connectivity with hard to reach areas.
Running cables is often not an option making wireless the only option. Examples include rows of machines
with overhead gantry systems in an automobile assembly factory as shown in Figure 15. In this scenario,
two rows of machines create a canyon effect. If a wireless device is stationed within the canyon,
connectivity to the device would be unreliable. One option would be to raise the antenna height of the
wireless device such that a LOS connection is possible; however, not all devices or antennas can be moved
or relocated. Another possible solution makes use of the multipath environment. Machines are often
enclosed in highly reflective metal boxes. Since RF signals reflect well off most flat metal surfaces,
antennas could be positioned to make use of the reflected energy.
In the figure, Antenna 1 uses the reflected energy off the adjacent machine to maintain connection with the
access point mounted on the wall. Antenna 2, must be positioned higher since the adjacent wall is made of
concrete which is not a good RF reflector. If the wall happened to be made of sheet metal, then it would
be possible to use multi-path in the same way as Antenna 1. An important consideration is how often the
layout of the factory changes. Frequent changes in the location of machines could make such an installation
more prone to quality of service fluctuations.

7.4 Non-Production Emitters such as Microwave Ovens

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

Many common devices such as microwave ovens, cell phone hotspots, automobile hotspots, video games,
baby monitors, personal Bluetooth devices, and others will emit RF energy. These devices can interfere
with factory wireless operations, and steps should be taken to mitigate impacts through technological,
educational, and policy enforcement. The microwave oven is discussed in this section. Microwave ovens
are an important source of RF interference. Because these devices generate electromagnetic waves within
the 2400 MHz ISM band where many industrial wireless networks operate, they can severely degrade the
performance of the networks by introducing RF interference. The amount of interference will depend on
the proximity of the ovens to the network devices. Industrial networks will often experience network
failures during scheduled lunch breaks when one or more microwave ovens are used for extended periods
of time. To reduce or eliminate the impacts of microwave ovens on an industrial wireless network, the
following steps should be followed. Some of these steps are illustrated in Figure 16.
Distance - Keep microwave ovens in a room far away from the industrial operation. The intensity of the
microwave oven interference will decrease with distance.
Oven Quality – Chose microwave ovens that are high quality and well shielded. A commercial rating does
not indicate quality or shielding capability. Testing microwave ovens for interference levels at
progressively increasing distance using a spectrum analyzer may be of benefit.
Containing Room – Place the ovens in a designated room such as a lunch room or adjacent room with a
metal door. If the room is near to the factory operation, it may be necessary to shield the room. Metal foil
can be applied to walls, doors, and windows to contain the interference but can be a costly investment.
Windows can be covered or shielded to prevent interference leakage.
Change RF Band – Move the factory wireless network to another band such as 900 MHz band or 5 GHz.
Microwave ovens impact the upper half of the 2.4 GHz ISM band more than the lower half[20]; therefore,
it may be possible to limit the operation of the industrial wireless network to channels at the lower end of
the 2.4 GHz band, for example, channels below 2.44 GHz.
Cleaning – Keeping microwave ovens clean can prevent EM leakage.

7.5 Confined Space Gas Sensing and Safety Applications
Confined spaces are present in many plants and factories. Tanks, large pipes, manholes, boilers, and
painting rooms are examples of confined spaces. Various communications scenarios may occur at confined
spaces including environment monitoring, voice communications, and human occupancy identifications.
Most of these are safety-related applications and hence reliable communications are required.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-4

One of the major safety applications in confined spaces is gas sensing and air quality monitoring. Generally,
confined spaces present a threat to safety from the accumulation of poisonous or combustible gases such as
oxygen, carbon monoxide, benzene, and hydrogen sulfide. Confined spaces have poor ventilation leading
to gas accumulation. It is also difficult to evacuate personnel when a dangerous situation does occur.
Wireless gas sensors are used for the detection of gases prior to entering a confined space and for continuous
monitoring to maintain continuous safety. While wireless sensors are a useful technology to help maintain
a safe working environment, it is important to understand the challenges of wireless when used in confined
spaces. Figure 17 shows an illustration of a gas sensing in confined spaces. In this scenario, a man is
welding in a confined space. The welding torch is producing carbon monoxide gas. The entry to the space
is small with an adjacent manhole and ladder. Evacuation from the space would be difficult if ventilation
fails and poisonous gases accumulate. In this and similar scenarios, the following actions would help to
maintain safety using a wireless sensor network.
RF Environment – Understand the materials of the confined space and how radio waves propagate within
it. Spaces with metal walls will reflect radio waves whereas concrete will absorb the RF waves.
Testing – Understand latency and reliability of each wireless solution with thorough testing before using a
wireless gas sensing application in a live scenario. Sensor applications should support black-box testing.
Antenna Placement – Place sensors and relay nodes to maximize LOS communication. Align antennas to
maximize receive power and polarization alignment.
Redundancy – Use multiple sensors within the confined space in case one fails.
Intrinsic Safety – Select wireless devices that meet applicable intrinsic safety standards.
Common Sense – Do not allow technology to override or replace common sense practices.

Within the aerospace industry some mechanics work in difficult conditions inside commercial aircraft
confined spaces such as fuel tanks and wing structure. To protect their safety, a two-way radio is assigned
to each employee and checked out through a registration process. A responsible attendant monitors all the
entrants at a command center by periodically sending communication signals and text messages to them. A
typical work effort in confined space involves handling sealants and chemicals thereby requiring constant
surveillance. Gas detectors may use multiple sensors looking for oxygen level and presence of hazardous
gases such as carbon monoxide. Other requirements may include lower explosive level detectors, and photo
ionization sensors engineered to detect volatile organic compounds. The safety devices continuously
monitor the air quality and transmit text and voice data. In addition, Bluetooth beacons communicate with
entrant radios to report the location of the workers within the factory. In emergency situations such as
building evacuation, the wireless safety system will inform the employees to leave their work areas.
