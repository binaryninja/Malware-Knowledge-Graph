I. Cutlet ATM Malware Background
This Cutlet malware became one of the most widely used malware targeting Automated Teller
Machines (ATMs). The ATM malware is available on the underground and leveraged by
multiple actors in numerous ATM jackpotting heists. The malware targets one ATM vendor
only, which is Diebold Nixdorf, formerly known as Wincor Nixdorf.
II. Method of Operation
The Cutlet malware is to be installed into individual ATMs, designed to make targeted
machines dispense bills automatically via emptying cash-carrying cassettes. Typically, the
ATM malware operation requires two individuals to be involved: one with the direct physical
access to the ATM device connected to its backend USB port via a controlled PC; another
one - remotely connected and able to release the key to dispense the cash to the first
individual. By and large, the Cutlet malware, written in Borland Delphi, demonstrates its
developer familiarity with the ATM-specific model proprietary API calls.
III. Threat Scope
Alongside with the infamous Tyupkin, Skimer, and Ripper ATM malware, the Cutlet ATM
malware is a formidable threat on the ATM malware landscape. The surfaced reports
generated a significant amount of attention to the malware from the industry(1)(2) and has
sparked interest within the cybercriminal underground.
IV. Cutlet ATM Malware Analysis (version 1.0 F)
A. "start cooking" and "CHECK HEAT" functions
Essentially, while heavily packed, the core Cutlet ATM malware is rather trivial and targets
only ATM manufacturer. The variant accepts the integer input from 1-9, which corresponds to
ATM cassette slot number from 1-9.

2/5

<cassette slot number (integer) x 50 "CUTLETS" of banknotes count 60>
The main malware functions work as follows:
"start cooking!" -> Dispense 50 "CUTLETS" of banknotes count 60
"CHECK HEAT" -> Dispense 1 "CUTLET"
"Reset" -> Reset the cash dispensing process
"Stop!" -> Terminates the cash "cooking" process
B. ATM's CSCWCNG API calls to dispense and transport cash
The malware operates leveraging the Nixdorf proprietary CSCWCNG.DLL API calls to
manipulate the machine as follows:
CscCngOpen -> Connect to the ATM cashout module called "CNG" and open the device
CscCngDispense -> Dispense cash function to tray
CscCngTransport -> Transport cash to the collection for pickup
V. Possible Mitigation
Monitoring, and reviewing any third-party applications that leverage the CSCWCNG API calls
might assist with mitigating exposure to the Cutlet malware once it is already installed. It
might be a good idea to whitelist only necessary applications to allow them to leverage these
API calls.
