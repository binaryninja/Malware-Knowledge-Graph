Recently, 360 Security Team found the new variant of GlobeImposter ransomware family is
actively spreading worldwide that has affected the great number of users. Moreover, the
attack is expected to be more serious in the future.
GlobeImposter can be seen as one of the most powerful ransomware in these years. It uses
a high-intensity algorithm for encryption. Once the files are encrypted, it is almost impossible
to decrypt the documents. Then the hacker will send the payment method to the victim via
email, and the victim is charged from 1 to 10 bitcoins.
Users should be aware of the severity of GlobeImposter ransomware attack due to not only
its high-intensity data encryption algorithm but also its large number of variants. There have
been more than 20 varieties of the family’s variants since June.

The new variant discovered this time is with the extension NACRO. Although it is similar to
the previous variants, the power of the attack is still not to be underestimated. If the
computer is infected, the victim will find they cannot open their files, and the format will be
tampered with seriously. After that, the attack will leave the contact form to the victim as
usual.
