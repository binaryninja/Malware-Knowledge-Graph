Did you ever think you would have a digital drug lord in the palm of your hand? No, we're not
talking about a game. We're talking about malware that aims to steal your banking
information. A new variant of the Abrebot malware has been nicknamed "Escobar" after its
package name.
With the package name of com.escobar.pablo, the malware includes a number of the same
features and code as another one named Aberebot. Researchers at Cyble, a security
research organization, found the malware by scouring a cybercrime-oriented forum. The
feature set includes remote view, phishing overlays, screen captures, text-message
captures, and even multi-factor authentication capture.

All of those features are used in tandem with an attempt to steal a user's banking
information. This malware even goes so far as to disguise itself as McAfee antivirus
software, and even uses the McAfee logo as its icon. Masquerading as security software is
nothing new—in fact, we recently reported on malware that was packaged directly inside of a
fully functioning 2-factor authentication app.

List Of Permissions That Escobar Malware Can Abuse
The full list of dangers of this particular malware is extensive. Not only can it do what was
outlined above. It can also bypass your screen lock and even send text messages to your
entire contact list. It also can record audio from the microphone, get your location, and
initiate phone calls. The malware even has the capability of checking the phone's access to
data, such as if you turned off mobile data and turn it back on again.

The absolute biggest threat though is that it can even read from the official Google
Authenticator app, without user interaction, by directly interfacing with it to capture any codes
that might be used during a login process.
How can you protect yourself from such a nasty piece of work? Well, so far the malware
does not look to have been included in any official distribution via the Play Store. So don't do
any side-loading of APKs that you don't trust, or don't side-load at all. Watch your mobile and
Wi-Fi data on your device and if there are any apps you don't recognize using extra data,
look into them.

If you have any legitimate malware detecting apps, pay attention to their notices. If you
believe you've been infected, unfortunately, the best way to eradicate is a factory reset. So,
run a backup of anything you deem important on your device (be careful not to include the
3/4

malware of course) and run your factory reset. The researchers even recommend removing
your SIM card because of the data interaction and capabilities of this app to re-activate your
mobile data connection without user interaction.

If you find fraudulent behavior on your banking or financial accounts you should immediately
contact the associated institution. You should also change your passwords on anything
associated. Additionally, while it is a best practice to not share passwords across accounts,
we know full well that people will do this anyway. If any passwords are shared with the
associated account it is best to change passwords on all of them.
