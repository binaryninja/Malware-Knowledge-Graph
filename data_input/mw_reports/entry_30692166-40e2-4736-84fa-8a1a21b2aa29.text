Introduction
Some time ago, a Kaspersky Lab customer in Latin America contacted us to say he had
visited China and suspected his machine was infected with an unknown, undetected
malware. While assisting the customer, we found a very interesting file in the system that is
completely unrelated to China and contained no Chinese coding traces. At first look, it
pretends to be a Java related application but after a quick analysis, it was obvious this was
something more than just a simple Java file. It was a targeted attack we are calling
“Machete”.

What is “Machete”?

1/8

“Machete” is a targeted attack campaign with Spanish speaking roots. We believe this
campaign started in 2010 and was renewed with an improved infrastructure in 2012. The
operation may be still “active”.
The malware is capable of the following cyber-espionage operations:
Logging keystrokes
Capturing audio from the computer’s microphone
Capturing screenshots
Capturing geolocation data
Taking photos from the computer’s web camera
Copying files to a remote server
Copying files to a special USB device if inserted
Hijjacking the clipboard and capturing information from the target machine

Targets of “Machete”

2/8

Most of the victims are located in, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Russia, Cuba, and
Spain, among others. In some cases, such as Russia, the target appears to be an embassy
from one of the countries of this list.
Targets include high-level profiles, including intelligence services, military, embassies and
government institutions.

How does “Machete” operate?

3/8

The malware is distributed via social engineering techniques, which includes spear-phishing
emails and infections via Web by a fake Blog website. We have found no evidence of of
exploits targeting zero-day vulnerabilities. Both the attackers and the victims appear to be
Spanish-speaking.
During this investigation, we also discovered many other the files installing this cyberespionage tool in what appears to be a dedicated a spear phishing campaign. These files
display a PowerPoint presentation that installs the malware on the target system once the file
is opened. These are the names of the PowerPoint attachments:
Hermosa XXX.pps.rar
Suntzu.rar
El arte de la guerra.rar
Hot brazilian XXX.rar
These files are in reality Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archives and have compilation dates
going back to 2008.
A consequence of the embedded Python code inside the executables is that these installers
include all the necessary Python libraries as well as the PowerPoint file shown to the victim
during the installation. The result is extremely large files, over 3MB.
Here are some screnshots of the mentioned files:

4/8

A technical relevant fact about this campaign is the use of Python embedded into Windows
executables of the malware. This is very unusual and does not have any advantage for the
attackers except ease of coding. There is no multi-platform support as the code is heavily
Windows-oriented (use of libraries). However, we discovered several clues that the attackers
prepared the infrastructure for Mac OS X and Unix victims as well. In addition to Windows
components, we also found a mobile (Android) component.
Both attackers and victims speak Spanish natively, as we see it consistently in the source
code of the client side and in the Python code.

Indicators of Compromise
Web infections
The following code snippets were found into the HTML of websites used to infect victims:

Domains
The following are domains found during the infection campaign. Any communication with
them must be considered extremely suspicious

Human part of “Machete”
Language
The first evidence is the language used, both for the victims and attackers, is Spanish.
The victims are all Spanish speaking according to the filenames of the stolen documents.
The language is also Spanish for the operators of the campaign, we can find all the server
side code written in this language: reportes, ingresar, peso, etc.

Conclusion
The “Machete” discovery shows there are many regional players in the world of targeted
attacks. Unfortunately, such attacks became a part of the cyber arsenal of many nations
located over the world. We can be sure there are other parallel targeted attacks running now
in Latin America and other regions.
Kaspersky Lab products detect malicious samples related to this targeted attack as TrojanSpy.Python.Ragua.
