Introduction
Fortinet has discovered a new botnet capable of stealing large amounts of user information,
as well as remotely manipulating compromised machines. The malware appears to be based
on an older botnet known as Grabbot, which was first discovered back in November of 2014.
This new variant improves on that existing functionality while adding several dangerous new
features. This blog aims to offer a quick insight into how Grabbot functions.

Replication
The bot can be found hosted on a number of compromised websites with a random filename.
We currently suspect that Grabbot may arrive on these hosts through Exploit Kits or other
malicious campaigns.
The bot may drop several files in the following paths:
●"%AppData%\{GUID}\{generated filename}.exe"
●"%AppData%\{GUID}\{generated filename}.bat"
●"%AppData%\{GUID}\{generated filename}"
Note that each generated filename is different, with the host machine’s System Volume
Information. Several mutexes are created in the same way. Each drop file also has its file
time information set to be the same as “cmd.exe” in Windows.
1/7

The malware creates the following registry entry to survive system reboots:
●HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
○{GUID} = "%AppData%\{GUID}\{generated filename}.exe"
During execution, the bot may inject the main payload into explorer.exe and delete the
original file.

Browser Targeting
The bot enters a sleep loop and will not perform the rest of its functionality unless one of the
following internet browsers is found in the active process list:
●Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe)
●Firefox (firefox.exe)
●Google Chrome (chrome.exe)
●Opera (opera.exe)
Anti-analysis measures
The bot also scans active processes for the presence of certain system analysis tools, such
as Wireshark or Process Explorer. If any is found, the bot may branch into a fake set of
behaviours instead of the actual payload.

C&C Connection
Before the bot attempts to contact the command and control (C&C) server, it first makes a
connection to www.microsoft.com to verify internet connectivity. If a connection can be
established, the bot will iterate through a list of possible C&C servers and contact each until
a response is received. The list of C&Cs observed in this sample are:
●http://de{REMOVED}is.site
●http://ge{REMOVED}et.site
●http://bi{REMOVED}ys.info
●http://on{REMOVED}nc.site
●http://de{REMOVED}is.info
●http://ss{REMOVED}rs.info
When a connection is established, the bot may attempt to download the following data files:
●/wordpress/ajax/d.dat
●/wordpress/ajax/e.dat
●/wordpress/ajax/f.dat
●/wordpress/ajax/out.dat
●/wordpress/ajax/g.dat

3/7

●/wordpress/ajax/h.dat
The files are saved on the disk with a generated filename. Notably, the file “out.dat” is
renamed to the executable file in the autorun registry. All communication between the bot
and the C&C are encrypted and done through HTTP. In any contact with a C&C, the bot will
try twice to establish connection before trying a different C&C.

C&C Commands
The botnet is capable of responding to the following commands:
Command

Function

user_execute

Executes a file on the host machine

bot_update

Updates the bot itself

conf_update

Updates the bot configuration

bot_uninstall

Removes the bot from the host machine

4/7

conf_update2

Updates the bot configuration

send_debug

Send system information and log data to C2

socks_bc

Establish SOCKS proxy

run_vnc

Creates VNC connection

install_bd1

Install Teamviewer backdoor

url_block_add

Blocks specific URLs from being accessed

url_block_rem

Removes URL blocking

grab_ftp

Retrieves FTP information from host

grab_cookies

Retrieves browser cookies from host

grab_sol

Retrieves local shared objects/flash cookies

grab_certs

Retrieves client certificates

grab_all

Retrieves data from all grab functions

del_cookies

Deletes browser cookies

grab_pop

Retrieves Outlook POP accounts

run_plugin_exe

Downloads and injects an executable into svchost.exe and runs it

run_plugin_dll

Downloads and injects a library into svchost.exe and runs it

Compared to the previous known version of Grabbot, there are several new commands
labeled “conf_update2”, “install_bd1”, “grab_pop”, “run_plugin_exe” and “run_plugin_dll”.

Sending Back Debug Information
5/7

The bot is able to extract current system information, including a list of active processes,
detected AV products, and a list of installed applications. The bot may send this information
to the C&C on command.

Banking Backdoor
The bot is also capable of tracking if specific sites, namely financial institutions and services,
are accessed, and may launch a proxy or remote access backdoor to steal information.
Some targeted sites from the list are as follows (in the format of *[URL]*;[backdoor cmd]
[arguments]):
●*paypal.com*;socks_bc 5.{REMOVED}.250:7777
●*hxxps://www1.royalbank.com/cgi-bin/rbaccess/*;run_vnc
●*hxxps://easyweb.td.com/*;run_vnc
●*hxxps://www1.bmo.com/onlinebanking/cgi-bin/netbnx/NBmain?product=5*;run_vnc

Crypto-Currency Wallet Stealing
The bot recursively scans the %AppData% directory looking for files with the name
“wallet.dat”, “electrum.dat” or “wallet”. If any match is found, the contents of the file are read
and encrypted, then stored into a temporary file for retrieval.

Conclusion
Grabbot was a relatively unknown bot in the past, but from our brief analysis of this new
variant it is apparent that Grabbot now has the potential to be very dangerous. Although we
are still investigating its current distribution method, Fortinet is able to detect this new variant
and we will keep you updated on any further changes.
