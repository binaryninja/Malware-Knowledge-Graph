Foreword
Crime and espionage form a dark underworld of cyberspace. Whereas crime is usually the first to seek out new
opportunities and methods, espionage usually follows in its wake, borrowing techniques and tradecraft. The
Shadows in the Cloud report illustrates the increasingly dangerous ecosystem of crime and espionage and its
embeddedness in the fabric of global cyberspace.
This ecosystem is the product of numerous factors. Attackers employ complex, adaptive attack techniques that
demonstrate high-level ingenuity and opportunism. They take advantage of the cracks and fissures that open up
in the fast-paced transformations of our technological world. Every new software program, social networking
site, cloud computing, or cheap hosting service that is launched into our everyday digital lives creates an
opportunity for this ecosystem to morph, adapt, and exploit.
It has also emerged because of poor security practices of users, from individuals to large organizations. We
take for granted that the information and communications revolution is a relatively new phenomenon, still
very much in the midst of unceasing epochal change. Public institutions have adopted these new technologies
faster than procedures and rules have been created to deal with the radical transparency and accompanying
vulnerabilities they introduce.
Today, data is transferred from laptops to USB sticks, over wireless networks at café hot spots, and stored across
cloud computing services whose servers are located in far-off political jurisdictions. These new modalities of
communicating de-concentrate and disperse the targets of exploitation, multiplying the points of exposure
and potential compromise. Paradoxically, documents and data are probably safer in a file cabinet, behind the
bureaucrat’s careful watch, than they are on the PC today.
The ecosystem of crime and espionage is also emerging because of opportunism on the part of actors. Cyber
espionage is the great equalizer. Countries no longer have to spend billions of dollars to build globe-spanning
satellites to pursue high-level intelligence gathering, when they can do so via the web. We have no evidence in
this report of the involvement of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) or any other government in the Shadow
network. But an important question to be entertained is whether the PRC will take action to shut the Shadow
network down. Doing so will help to address long-standing concerns that malware ecosystems are actively
cultivated, or at the very least tolerated, by governments like the PRC who stand to benefit from their exploits
though the black and grey markets for information and data.
Finally, the ecosystem is emerging because of a propitious policy environment — or rather the absence of
one — at a global level. Governments around the world are engaged in a rapid race to militarize cyber space,
to develop tools and methods to fight and win wars in this domain. This arms race creates an opportunity
structure ripe for crime and espionage to flourish. In the absence of norms, principles and rules of mutual
restraint at a global level, a vacuum exists for subterranean exploits to fill.
There is a real risk of a perfect storm in cyberspace erupting out of this vacuum that threatens to subvert
cyberspace itself, either through over-reaction, a spiraling arms race, the imposition of heavy-handed controls,
or through gradual irrelevance as people disconnect out of fear of insecurity.

There is, therefore, an urgent need for a global convention on cyberspace that builds robust mechanisms of
information sharing across borders and institutions, defines appropriate rules of the road for engagement in the
cyber domain, puts the onus on states to not tolerate or encourage mischievous networks whose activities
operate from within their jurisdictions, and protects and preserves this valuable global commons.
Until such a normative and policy shift occurs, the shadows in the cloud may grow into a dark, threatening storm.

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

IV

Executive Summary
Shadows in the Cloud documents a complex ecosystem of cyber espionage that systematically compromised
government, business, academic, and other computer network systems in India, the Offices of the Dalai Lama,
the United Nations, and several other countries. The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen
from politically sensitive targets and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents
from the Offices of the Dalai Lama and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing
sensitive information on citizens of numerous third-party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business
information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the
malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing
systems, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while
operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation
of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some
of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an
eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the
Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation
techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

Summary of Main Findings


Complex cyber espionage network - Documented evidence of a cyber espionage network that compromised government, business, and academic computer systems in India, the Office of the Dalai Lama, and the United Nations.
Numerous other institutions, including the Embassy of Pakistan in the United States, were also compromised. Some of
these institutions can be positively identified, while others cannot.



Theft of classified and sensitive documents - Recovery and analysis of exfiltrated data, including one document that
appears to be encrypted diplomatic correspondence, two documents marked “SECRET”, six as “RESTRICTED”, and
five as “CONFIDENTIAL”. These documents are identified as belonging to the Indian government. However, we do not
have direct evidence that they were stolen from Indian government computers and they may have been compromised
as a result of being copied onto personal computers. The recovered documents also include 1,500 letters sent from the
Dalai Lama’s office between January and November 2009. The profile of documents recovered suggests that the attackers targeted specific systems and profiles of users.



Evidence of collateral compromise - A portion of the recovered data included visa applications submitted to Indian
diplomatic missions in Afghanistan. This data was voluntarily provided to the Indian missions by nationals of 13 countries as part of the regular visa application process. In a context like Afghanistan, this finding points to the complex nature
of the information security challenge where risks to individuals (or operational security) can occur as a result of a data
compromise on secure systems operated by trusted partners.



Command-and-control infrastructure that leverages cloud-based social media services - Documentation of a complex and tiered command and control infrastructure, designed to maintain persistence. The infrastructure made use of
freely available social media systems that include Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs, blog.com and Yahoo!
Mail. This top layer directed compromised computers to accounts on free web hosting services, and as the free hosting
servers were disabled, to a stable core of command and control servers located in the PRC.



Links to Chinese hacking community - Evidence of links between the Shadow network and two individuals living in
Chengdu, PRC to the underground hacking community in the PRC.

Introduction - Building upon GhostNet

Research into computer network exploitation, cyber espionage, malware and botnets has expanded in recent
years from a relatively small cottage industry involving primarily technical experts to a major global phenomenon
which now includes academia, defence, intelligence, law enforcement, and the private sector. The rapid rise of
this industry is in part a recognition of the significant threat that these global criminal ecosystems represent to
critical infrastructure, government systems, personal privacy, commerce, and defense. Several high profile cases
and events, including the attacks on Google and other American companies in December 2009, underscore the
growing threat environment and suggest that these attacks are becoming the norm rather than an exception.
Policymakers are responding with legislation, institutional reforms and new initiatives, and an already sizable
market for cyber security services is mushrooming into a multi-billion dollar global industry.
This report aims to contribute to research and debate in this domain. Its release is strategic, coming roughly one
year after the publication of Tracking GhostNet (See Box 1, below).
Box 1. Tracking GhostNet: Lessons Learned
Tracking Ghostnet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network was the product of a ten-month investigation and
analysis focused on allegations of Chinese cyber espionage against the Tibetan community. The research entailed
field-based investigations in India, Europe and North America working directly with affected Tibetan organizations,
including the Private Office of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, and several Tibetan NGOs in Europe
and North America. The fieldwork generated extensive data that allowed us to examine Tibetan information security
practices, as well as capture evidence of malware that had penetrated Tibetan computer systems. We also engaged
in extensive data analysis and technical investigation of web-based interfaces to command and control servers that
were used by attackers to send instructions to, and receive data from compromised computers.
The report documented a wide ranging network of compromised computers, including at least 1,295 spread across
103 countries, 30 percent of which we identified and determined to be “high-value” targets, including ministries
of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news organizations, and a computer located at NATO
headquarters. Although there was circumstantial evidence pointing to elements within the People’s Republic of
China, our investigation concluded that there was not enough evidence to implicate the Chinese government itself
and attribution behind GhostNet remains a mystery.
The report’s aftermath was a learning experience. The data that had been collected during the GhostNet investigation
included sensitive information about compromised computers in over a hundred countries. Many of the victims
were understandably concerned about which of their computers were targeted and compromised, and came to us
for information. On our side, we felt unsure about the protocol around information sharing, and were in an awkward
position to be able to give information over to governments and affected parties directly without being entirely clear
about whom would be responsible and whether or not our interlocutors were appropriate authorities. The notification
problems around Ghostnet informed our approach to the Shadows in the Cloud investigation, including being more
conscious from the outset of documenting our notification procedures.

The title of the report ­— Shadows in the Cloud: An Investigation into Cyber Espionage 2.0 — is suggestive of
several threads that wind their way through the investigation. First, the malware networks we document and
analyze are to a large degree organized and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control
servers. Second, although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and
possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 1: BACKGROUND & CONTEXT

of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification. The 2.0 designation
also contains a double entendre: it refers to a generational shift we believe is unfolding in malware networks in
multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread
across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. The 2.0 reference is also meant to note how the Shadow investigation
is both a re-engagement with, but also a departure from, its predecessor: the Tracking GhostNet investigation.
This report is a continuation of Tracking GhostNet, but also represents a significantly new investigation yielding
different and more nuanced evidence and analysis of the evolving cybercrime and cyber espionage environment. As with GhostNet, we are interested in better understanding the evolving nature and complex ecosystem
of today’s malware networks and see this investigation as helping to build a knowledge base around cyber security research. In this respect, Shadows in the Cloud is very much a work-in-progress, insofar as we began this
investigation by picking up several threads that were left open-ended or unanswered in the original GhostNet
investigation, and expect to continue to examine threads that are left hanging in this report.
The aim of this present investigation is to further refine the methodologies used to investigate and analyze
malware networks through a fusion methodology, which combines network-based technical interrogation, data
analysis and visualization, and field-based contextual investigations (See Box 2, below). The combination of
methods from different disciplines is a critical and common feature of both the GhostNet and Shadow investigations and analyses. Network-based technical interrogation, open source data mining and analysis (using tools
such as Google), key informant interviews and field-based investigations on their own can accomplish a great
deal, but it is through their fusion that a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding can be achieved.
Box 2. Operationalizing the Fusion Methodology
Over the past decade we have been developing a fusion methodology for investigating the exercise of political
power in cyberspace. This approach combines quantitative, qualitative and technical data, and draws on
multidisciplinary analysis techniques to derive results. In our field investigations, we conduct research among
affected target audiences and employ techniques that include interviews, long-term in situ interaction with our
partners, and technical data collection involving system monitoring, network reconnaissance, and interrogation.
Data and in situ analysis from field investigations are then taken to the lab where they are analysed using a variety
of data fusion and visualization methods, based around the Palantir data fusion system. Leads developed on
the basis of in-field activities are pursued through technical investigations and the resulting data and analysis
outputs are shared with our in-field teams and partners for verification and for generating additional entry points
for follow-on field investigations. We then interpret results from these investigations through a variety of theoretical
lenses drawing from disciplines of political science, international relations, sociology, risk analysis, and criminology
(among others). We believe that through this mixed methods interdisciplinary approach we are able to develop a
richer understanding than would be possible from studies that focus solely on technical analysis or that primarily
consist of legal, policy or theoretical investigations.

The Shadow investigation began as a follow-up of unexplored paths discovered during the GhostNet investigation. It started in the offices of Tibetan organizations who suspected they were targets of cyber espionage, and
broadened to include a much wider list of victims. The investigation used a number of techniques, including
a DNS sinkhole we established by registering domains that had previously been used by the attackers targeting Tibetan institutions, such as a computer system at the offices of the Dalai Lama. This reinforces our view
that the combination of technical analysis and field investigation forms a fruitful starting point of inquiry that
ultimately leads to important insights into the attackers’ capabilities, the ability to investigate a much wider
domain of infected targets, and a contextual understanding of the attackers.

As was the case with GhostNet, dozens of high-level government networks, embassies, international organizations and others have been penetrated, and confidential, sensitive, and private documents stolen. The Shadows
report underscores the interconnected and complex challenges of cyber security. In particular, it points to the
possibility of a perfect storm that may result from a lack of international consensus, ill-developed and implemented security practices, a paucity of notification mechanisms, and the growing confluence of cyber crime,
traditional espionage, and the militarization of cyberspace.

1.2

About the Shadows in the Cloud Investigation:

Beyond GhostNet
The Tracking GhostNet report revealed a small piece of the underground cyber espionage world. After the
report was published, several of the command and control servers listed in the report and part of the network
went offline. However, targeted cyber attacks against Tibetan interests and various governments did not suddenly cease. The Shadowserver Foundation had also been looking into several similar cyber attacks both prior
to and after the GhostNet report was published. Approximately six months after the report’s publication, the
Shadowserver Foundation and the Information Warfare Monitor began a collaborative effort to further investigate new and related attacks, as well as any remaining parts of GhostNet.
Shadows in the Cloud thus departs from Tracking GhostNet in several ways. Research on cyber security is
rapidly developing, and several groups with widely differing skill sets and experience are working on related areas.
Information sharing, generally speaking, is immature and underdeveloped, often hampered by proprietary
concerns surrounding the commercial market for cyber security services. Progress on research in this area will
only stand to benefit from greater dialogue and information sharing among security researchers. Shadows in the
Cloud was thus undertaken jointly by the Information Warfare Monitor, which itself is a collaborative engagement between a public and private institution, and the Shadowserver Foundation, which is an all-volunteer
watchdog group of security professionals who gather, track and report on malware, botnet activity, and electronic fraud. The Information Warfare Monitor and the Shadowserver Foundation have several complementary
resources and data sets. Combining efforts in this way contributed to a much greater pool of knowledge and
expertise from which to draw strategic choices along each step of the investigation, and for overall analysis.
Lastly, the information sharing that went into Shadows in the Cloud extended to the Office of His Holiness the
Dalai Lama (OHHDL), the Tibetan Government in Exile (TGIE) and Tibetan non-governmental organizations.
Information sharing among victims of network intrusions and espionage is rare. The Tibetan organizations were
willing to provide access and share information with our investigation that proved to be invaluable.
Shadows in the Cloud is also distinct from Tracking GhostNet in terms of the type of data unearthed during the
course of the investigation. With GhostNet, while we were able to monitor the exfiltration of sensitive documents
from computers to which we had field access, we were unable to otherwise determine which documents were
stolen from victims that we had identified, and thus could only infer intentionality on the part of the attackers. In
Shadows, we were able to recover a significant volume of stolen documents, some of which are highly sensitive,
from a drop zone connected to one of the malware networks under observation. Although not unprecedented
among cyber security research, access to stolen documents such as those which are analysed here offers a
unique but partial insight into the type of information that can be leaked out of compromised computers. It may
even help answer some lingering questions about the intentionality and attribution of the attackers, although
that is not clear by any means. We pick up both of these threads in detail in our report below.

Research Framework

Although the research that we engage in is investigatory, it is not simply a report of the facts per se. Our aim is
to engage the cyber security research community by building upon prior research in a structured, focused manner
through a systematic research framework. Several overarching research questions structure the Shadow investigation and our analysis. We outline these here, and pick up on them throughout our report.

Observation and Characterization of the Ecosystem of Malware
One of the aims of cyber security research is to observe and characterize the evolving nature and complex
ecosystem of today’s malware, botnets, cyber espionage and cyber crime networks. This is not a simple task,
as the ecosystem of malware is very much like a complex adaptive system, only one that is dispersed across
multiple ecosystems, operated by clandestine actors with potential criminal and/or espionage motivations who
have shown a propensity to adapt their techniques to new software tools, social networking platforms and other
technologies. Crimeware networks, which to some extent are the oldest and most widespread malware networks, target generalized population sets in a mostly undiscriminating fashion. Alongside crimeware networks,
however, there are other networks that are more discriminating, often characterized by the use of custom-made
software attacks, and which seek to exploit and infiltrate not random pools of victims but rather deliberately
selected targets. Within each of these two major types of malware networks are likely many sub-types, including networks that specialize in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Confusing matters further is that
toolkits and techniques used in one instance are borrowed from another, making classification difficult and
increasingly questionable. Being able to map the ecosystem of malware, however, is critical for research, policy
and operational matters, and so is one of the primary aims of our research in Shadows in the Cloud (Adair 2010).

From Criminal Exploitation to Political Espionage?
Cyber crime is as old as cyberspace itself, and criminal networks, as alluded to above, are longstanding characteristics of the dark side of the Internet. What is more novel is the use of criminal exploitation kits, techniques
and networks for purposes of political espionage (Villeneuve 2010). Debates about whether or not governments
are actively involved in cyber espionage and computer network exploitation, either through agencies they
control directly or through some kind of privateering, now dominate the headlines and have become part of a
growing politicization of the cyber security arena. One of the aims of our research is to discern to what extent
we can impute motivations behind the attacks we document, to help understand whether in fact the networks
under our observation are part of a criminal network, a political espionage network, an industrial espionage
network, an opportunistic network, or some combination of these. Such questions, it should be pointed out, are
entirely distinct (though not unrelated) to the question of attribution (i.e., who is responsible?).
We hypothesize that political espionage networks may be deliberately exploiting criminal kits, techniques and
networks both to distance themselves from attribution and strategically cultivate a climate of uncertainty. To
answer these questions requires a high degree of nuance, as the information we have been able to obtain is
incomplete, and so a great deal of our analysis rests on inferences made on the basis of multiple data sources
and our fusion methodology (See Box 2, page 3).

Collateral Compromise
Organizations from around the world have moved swiftly to adopt new information and communication
technologies, and have become part of electronically linked communities in the commercial, government, and

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 1: BACKGROUND & CONTEXT

6

military sectors. They exchange information as a matter of routine, across social networking and cloud computing platforms, using flash drives and other portable devices, and thus become co-dependent on each others’
information and computer and network security practices. The vulnerabilities of one actor can quickly and
unintentionally compromise unwitting third parties, which in turn can become the basis for actionable intelligence against those third parties. We hypothesize that there is a high probability for collateral compromise
in any malware network because of this mutual dependence. A key consideration, of course, is how to discern
intended from unintended victims, a problem that is difficult to solve.

Actionable Intelligence around Exfiltrated Data
Related to collateral compromise is the issue of the strategic value of exfiltrated data. Access to this data can
offer important clues about the motivation and attribution of the attackers. It can also provide insight about
the strategic value of the type of data that can be accessed through malware networks. In the course of our
investigation, we assumed that we would get, at best, only a partial picture of the exfiltrated data, but even that
partial picture would provide some potentially meaningful information for those who acquire it. While each individual data point may be of little value, when combined with other data acquired through other means (e.g.,
open source searching) a very detailed operational picture can be assembled. We try to assess and evaluate the
exfiltrated data we were able to access with these issues in mind.

Attribution
Examining attribution is an arduous but important component of any cyber security investigation and has
become a major political issue at the highest levels around several recent cyber attacks. In order to characterise
the attackers, a variety of technical indicators as well as behavioural indicators need to be analysed (Parker et
al. 2004; Parker et al. 2003). These characteristics are interpreted in the context of the nature of the targets and
the objective of the attack. The nature and timing of the attack, the exploit, the malware, and the command and
control infrastructure, are just some of the components that go into determining attribution. Knowing the methods and behaviour of the attackers as well as the character of the tools the attackers use once inside the target’s
network, the data that the attackers exfiltrate and where that data goes, are also crucial parts of the overall assessment (Bejtlich 2010; Cloppert 2009; Mandiant 2010).
Moreover, historical information and ongoing intelligence collection are crucial when trying to understand the
scope of the threat (Deloitte & Touche LLP, 2010). It is difficult to assess attribution when examining an isolated
attack; it is the broader patterns, connections and contextual information that inform the process. However, it is
uncommon to have a complete data set covering all aspects of the attackers’ operations. Some may have access
to data regarding the attackers’ activities once inside a particular network. Others may have extensive collections of malware samples and historical data on command and control infrastructure. Others may have information on how the attackers use various exploits, or craft targeted spear phishing emails and other methods focused
on compromising particular targets. Others may have data retrieved from the attackers that indicate the identity
of those who have been compromised. And finally still others may have the necessary geopolitical knowledge to
interpret the attacks within a broader context.
Often, investigations do not have the luxury of such a full data set and must rely on incomplete information and
partial observations. Further complicating matters is that any of this information is often dependent on mistakes
made by the attackers, which typically lead to slices of an overall network instead of a comprehensive view.
Any questions concerning attribution must therefore always be set against a context of a complete consideration
of alternative explanations and qualified observations.

Investigative Techniques

Methodology

The core of the methodology employed in the Shadows in the Cloud investigation rests at the nexus of technical
interrogation, field investigation, data analysis, and geopolitical, contextual research (See Box 2, page 3). No one
method alone is capable of providing a comprehensive understanding of malware networks; it is through their
combination that a complete picture is derived. For example, a technical analysis of exploits and malware used
by attackers alone can provide a great deal of insight into capabilities and targets. The command and control
servers used by the malware can be enumerated, and can sometimes reveal additional information that can be
used to identify those who have been compromised and data that may have been exfiltrated from these targets.
However, the technical analysis of exploits and malware samples alone only provides one crucial data set.
Field research is a critical, although sometimes neglected, component of malware research. While much of the
emphasis in existing malware research is focused on technical analysis of malware samples, this purely technical approach is unlikely to yield a complete picture. For example, through field research we have found compromised computers checking in with command and control servers that we have not seen in malware samples
distributed by the attackers. There is some evidence to suggest that attackers may migrate compromised hosts
to new command and control servers and/or command compromised computers to install new malware that is
not publicly disseminated through spear phishing and other targeted malware attacks. The field research component can thus provide an equally important insight into the attackers’ capabilities once the target’s network
is compromised, as well as updated command and control locations. Moreover, it allows for the investigation
of the context surrounding the the target and why the victims may have been targeted in the first place. Finally,
the wider geopolitical considerations, derived from both field investigations and contextual research, place the
collection of information in a broader context that supplies details around issues such as the timing of the attacks, the nature of the exploitation, including the use of any social engineering techniques, and potentially the
identity and motivation of the attackers.
We present our methodology in the following sequence – field investigation first, followed by technical investigations. However, in practice the two are iterative processes. In some circumstances, field investigations begin
first, followed by technical investigations, while in other cases the opposite is true. In this case, a technicalbased investigative technique (sinkhole analysis) is probably the closest to an actual starting point, although
even that method was informed by prior knowledge derived from field and contextual research reaching back
to the Tracking GhostNet report. In almost all circumstances, geopolitical and contextual research informs both
the technical and field research components. In practice, therefore, fusion methodology is a holistic, non-linear
approach, but one that takes place in a very structured and focused fashion.

2.2

Field Investigation

Our objective is to ultimately understand the capabilities and motivations of those engaged in targeted malware
attacks. Field research provides critical insight into the methods and operations of the attackers. By analyzing
computers at locations that are routinely targeted by (similar) attackers, we aim to identify portions of command and control infrastructure that the attackers use for particular targets as well as document the type of
data that the attackers exfiltrate from the targets. However, our research aims to be more than just extracting
information from those who have been compromised.

The Tracking GhostNet investigation revealed significant compromises at Tibetan-exile and Indian targets. It
was also found that Indian government related entities, both in India proper and throughout the world, had
been thoroughly compromised. These included computers at Indian embassies in Belgium, Serbia, Germany,
Italy, Kuwait, the United States, Zimbabwe, and the High Commissions of India in Cyprus and the United
Kingdom. During the GhostNet investigation we had discovered evidence of multiple infections for which the
information available was incomplete, and to which we wanted to return for follow up. In particular, we found
one piece of malware uploading sensitive documents. Another report published soon after Tracking GhostNet,
entitled “The Gh0st in the Shell: Network Security in the Himalayas,” analysed the network traffic of Air Jaldi,
a community WiFi network in Dharamsala, India. It found that computers in Dharamsala were connecting with
two of the control servers documented in our report (Vallentin et al. 2009).
With the aim of focusing on both these wider pattern of compromises, and the hanging threads from the previous investigation, we worked with our existing approach, informed by the view that collecting data as close
to the intended target as possible was likely to yield actionable evidence of breaches that could be followed
through to their source, lead to wider pools of target sets, and yield information on the attackers.
In conducting the field research we were influenced by the Action Research (AR) literature (Lewin 1946; Curle
1947) that has evolved since the 1940s, as well as other field-based investigation and research techniques. The
AR field-based approach feeds into the fusion methodology that guides our overall investigatory process. It
employs ethical and participatory observations and structured focused interviews. We combined this grounded
research with technical interrogation, including network monitoring activities. As with GhostNet, we were
fortunate to have the cooperation of Tibetan organizations, and benefited tremendously from the willingness of
His Holiness the Dalai Lama and other Tibetans to share information with our investigators. As a result, for the
Shadow investigation we conducted primary field research in Dharamsala, India from August until December
2009. (Dharamsala is the location of the OHHDL as well as the TGIE).
The primary objectives of the field investigations were to research the wider patterns of compromised Indian
and Tibetan related targets, investigate the reports of targeted malware attacks that have emerged from the
Tibetan community, and raise information and computer security awareness within the Tibetan community
and assist in their security planning and implementation. Throughout the field investigation process, we also
investigated the broader social, political, military, and intelligence context. We conducted extensive on-site
interviews with officials in the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, the Office of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan NGOs.
These interviews allowed us to gain an understanding of the security practices and network infrastructure of
compromised locations. We also used network monitoring software during field investigations in order to collect
technical data from compromised computer systems and perform an initial analysis to confirm the existence
of malware and the transfer of information between compromised computers and command and control servers. The network monitoring tools allowed us to collect samples from compromised computers and identify
command and control servers used by the attackers. The network monitoring was undertaken with the explicit
consent of the Tibetan organizations.
While monitoring the network traffic of a local NGO, Common Ground, as part of an Internet security audit,
traffic from a local WiFi mesh network, TennorNet was also captured, revealing malicious activity. An anomaly
was detected when analyzing this traffic: computers in Dharamsala were beaconing or checking in with a command and control server (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43) located in Chongqing, PRC. The location of Chongqing
is contextually interesting as it has a high concentration of Triads — well known Asian-based organized criminal networks — who have significant connections to the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party
(Lam 2009). The Triads have extended their traditional criminal activities to include technology-enabled crime

such as “computer software piracy and credit card forgery and fraud” (Choo 2008).
An investigation revealed that the computer on TennorNet generating the malicious traffic belonged to Mr. Serta
Tsultrim, a Tibetan Member of Parliament, editor of of the weekly Tibetan language newspaper Tibet Express
and the director of the Khawa Karpo Tibet Culture Centre. Tsultrim is also the coordinator of the Association of
Tibetan Journalists (ATJ). We probed for his threat perception, and who he felt might be targeting him and why.
We sought to establish his perception of what documents and correspondence might be particularly sensitive.
Tsultrim was particularly concerned about this network being compromised.
Following the discovery of this compromise, we approached the OHHDL and formally requested permission
to audit network traffic to determine whether we could identify similar beacon packets associated with the
command and control server (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43). A representative of OHHDL agreed that we could
access the office network under an agreement similar to the initial GhostNet investigation. In consultation with
OHHDL staff, we focused our attention on the desktop machines that were most likely to be compromised, and
commenced a network tap of a number of workstations. Interestingly, it was one of these workstations that
was the origin of the GhostNet investigation, where we had observed sensitive documents being exfiltrated in
September 2008. Almost immediately we identified malicious traffic connecting with the command and control
server (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43).
Our next step was to refer to the management interface in the ICSA-certified Cyberoam firewall that the OHHDL
had installed in their network as part of their extensive upgrading of security procedures in the wake of the
GhostNet breach. We isolated all outbound traffic to the command and control server and identified any other
machines on the office Local Area Network that were currently, or had recently, been communicating with the
command and control server. From the Cyberoam interface we were able to identify one other machine that was
compromised. We proceeded to tap the traffic from this machine and began to see domain names associated
with the distributed social media command and control channels that we would later identify in the lab as part
of the command and control infrastructure. Similarly, the lab investigation was able to reconstruct the documents
that were exfiltrated from OHHDL machines and we were able to brief OHHDL on the extent of the breach.

2.3

Technical Investigative Activities

Our technical investigation was comprised of several interrelated components:
 DNS Sinkholing - Through registering expired domain names previously used in cyber espionage attacks as
command and control servers, we were are able to observe incoming connections from still-compromised
computers. This allowed us to collect information on the methods of the attackers as well as the nature of
the victims.
 Malware Analysis - We collected malware samples from a variety of attacks that allowed us to determine
the exploits the attackers used, the theme used to lure targets into executing the malware, as well as the
command and control servers used by the attackers. We also analysed additional malware found on servers
under the control of the attackers. Malware samples consisted primarily of the files with the PDF, DOC, PPT
and EXE file extensions.
 Command and Control Server Topography - We were able to map out the command and control infrastructure of the attackers by linking information from the sinkhole, the field investigations and the malware analysis. We collected the domain names, URL paths and IP addresses used by the attackers. This allowed us to find
links between our research and other command and control servers observed in other attacks in prior research.

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 2: METHODOLOGY & INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES

11

 Victim Identification - We were able to identify victims that the attackers had compromised by analyzing
sinkhole server connections, recovering documents that had been exfiltrated, and viewing control panels
used by the attackers to direct the compromised computers.
 Data Recovery - We were able to retrieve documents that had been sent to drop zones from victim systems
and stolen by the attackers.
We carried out this research carefully, guided by principles rooted in the computer security field (Burstein 2008;
Cooke et al. 2005; Stone-Gross et al. 2009; Smith and Toppel 2009). Our aim was to understand and document
the activities of the attackers as well as gather enough information to enable notification of those who had been
compromised. The principles that guided our field and technical investigations include the following:
 We collected network data in the field from computers that had been compromised by malware with the
consent of the owners of the computers.
 We monitored command and control infrastructure and recovered exfiltrated data in order to gather enough
information to understand the activities of the attackers and obtain enough information to enable notification of the victims before moving to notify the service providers and hosting companies to seek to have the
networks shut down.
 We worked with government authorities in multiple jurisdictions to notify those who had been compromised and to take down the attacker’s command and control infrastructure.
 We were careful to store and handle all of the data we collected in a secure manner.

Mapping the
Shadows in the Cloud

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 3: MAPPING THE SHADOWS IN THE CLOUD

13

In order for us to begin to map the Shadows in the Cloud, it was important for us to have clear starting points.
The first and easiest starting point that we identified was to look back at what was related to and still operational from the previous Tracking GhostNet report. We focused primarily on the domains described in GhostNet
and set out to see what we could learn from them in their current state. The second was to continue collecting
and analyzing information on attacks gleaned from field research and reports that were shared with us by thirdparties. Each of these starting points branched off from one another and crossed paths in various ways, revealing at least two distinct cyber espionage networks.
We previously mentioned that a large portion of the domain names mentioned in Tracking GhostNet went offline
following the initial report. As a result, several of the domain names described in it were abandoned. The domains ultimately expired and were available for re-registration. This gave us the opportunity to take over these
domains and monitor any connections that might come to them. Doing this allowed us to see connections from
victims that were still infected, and learn more about how the command and control server was configured. The
Shadowserver Foundation has utilized this technique for a long time (Higgins 2008).
The investigation was broadened further when field research by the Information Warfare Monitor crossed paths
with research being done by the Shadowserver Foundation. The field research revealed that a computer system
in the OHHDL had been compromised by at least two different types of malware associated with targeted
malware intrusions. Based on our understanding of the malware, the domains and on-going research, we assess
that this compromise also involved at least two different cyber espionage groups and potentially even a third
one. Analysis of several malware components and their associated command and control servers ultimately led
to the discovery of an accessible drop zone for documents being siphoned off compromised systems.
The attackers’ command and control infrastructure is a critical component of maintaining persistent access to
compromised computers. Through this infrastructure, the attackers issue commands to the compromised machines as well as exfiltrate data to drop zones or to the command and control servers themselves. By carefully
examining the relationships between command and control servers we were able to map out the extent of one
such network and link it with other similar malware networks.
This report focuses on only one of these networks, one that we have named the Shadow network. This is a
complex network that leveraged social networking websites, webmail providers, free hosting providers and
services from some of the largest companies on the Internet as disposable command and control locations.
The first layer of control used blogs, newsgroups, and social networking services to maintain persistent control
as these system are unlikely to be detected as malicious. As compromised computers accessed these services,
they received another command and control location, often located on free web hosting providers. The command and control servers on the free hosting services are often disabled over time – most likely due to reports
of malicious activity. When the command and control servers on free web hosting services were disabled, the
compromised systems would receive commands from the social networking layer and then beacon (i.e., attempt
a connection) to a more stable inner core of dedicated systems located in the PRC. Unlike the command and
control servers on free web hosting services, these dedicated servers hosted in the PRC have proven to be quite
stable over time.

3.1

Analysis of Data while in the Field

During the field investigation we collected samples of network traffic from computers at the OHHDL and other
Tibetan-related locations. Inspection of network traffic from these computers revealed that at least three of them
were compromised and were communicating with the same set of command and control servers. The traffic
analysis revealed that these systems were all connecting to the domain jdusnemsaz.com. At the time it resolved
to the IP address 119.84.4.43, which is assigned to China Telecom in the province of Chongqing, PRC. The commands sent by the command and control server were identical to malware we found at the Tibetan NGO Drewla
and the OHHDL during our GhostNet investigation a year earlier, although were not part of the network that
was described in that initial report.
There is a similarity between the commands sent by the command and control server jdusnemsaz.com and
a previously identified control server, lookbytheway.net. In both cases, the network traffic captured from the
compromised computers revealed that the malware was exfiltrating sensitive documents.

Further analysis of the network traffic also revealed that at least one of the systems was infected with additional
malware not associated with the aforementioned command and control servers. The system was attempting
DNS resolutions of multiple hostnames. Two of the hostnames resolved to IP addresses but were not available
when the system attempted to communicate to them. The other hostname did not resolve at all.
The failed DNS resolution was for www.assam2008.net, which is a domain that has been used by a different
group of attackers in the past in conjunction with the Enfal trojan, and suggests a limited connection between
the current malware under investigation and malware used in previous attacks on other targets. This domain
name was available for registration and was added to our ongoing sinkhole project.
While recording network traffic in the field, we observed the attackers removing two senstive documents from
the OHHDL (see fig. 1, page 15). The data was compressed using CAB, split into 100kb chunks when necessary, encoded with base64, and then uploaded to a command and control server. In this case, data was being
uploaded to c2etejs.com, which is hosted on the same IP address (119.84.4.43) as jdusnemsaz.com.
We reconstructed the documents that were exfiltrated from the OHHDL: “letters - current.doc” and “letters - master
2009.doc (see fig. 2, page 15).” The documents contained over 1,500 letters sent from the Dalai Lama’s office
between January and November 2009. While many of the letters are perfunctory — responses to various invitations
and interview requests — they allow the attackers to collect information on anyone contacting the Dalai Lama’s
office. Moreover, there are some communications contained within these documents that could be considered sensitive, such as communications between the OHHDL and Offices of Tibet around the world. Some communications
contain generic information of the Dalai Lama’s travelling details including schedule of appearances – but very
little that could not be established through open sources and publicly available information on the internet.

Technical Investigation

During the technical investigation we examined the data collected from the field, third-party sources, and from
our DNS sinkhole project in order to determine the attack vectors used to exploit and compromise the victims.
While we were unable to determine how any one individual computer came to be compromised, we documented a variety of exploits used by the attackers. We mapped out the broader command and control infrastructure
by discovering new pieces of malware located on servers that we identified, and catalogued any new servers
that these instances of malware were configured with. We also looked at domains that were co-hosted on the
same servers we had already identified, and used searches to identify Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu
Blogs, blog.com, and Yahoo! Mail accounts that were misused by the attackers to update compromised computers with new command and control locations. We also discovered a panel or listing of compromised computers.
During our investigation into one of the servers we made a significant discovery: we were able to recover data
that was being exfiltrated by the attackers from compromised computers. These documents were only available
on the command and control server for a short time after being uploaded by the compromised systems, as the
attackers frequently removed them at irregular time intervals.

3.2.1 Attack Vectors / Malware
Victims of cyber espionage are often specifically targeted by the attacker and not by happenstance. While it is
possible for a cyber criminal to mass-distribute malware across the Internet with specific intent to compromise
a select set of individuals or organizations, it is not likely to be the most effective tool for the intended job. The
differences in approaches, based on an analysis of tools and kits, can therefore provide some insight into the
branching of cyber espionage from cyber crime, or at least help distinguish more “connected” attackers from
“less connected” ones. The varying levels of sophistication in tools, research and delivery set these actors apart,
can make them more or less effective, and establish their level of connection within the underground community. A very sophisticated attacker, for example, will likely be part of a network in the criminal underground
that has access to the latest exploits and kits that generate files with exploits to install their malicious payload.
These kits and files are not readily available to the average cyber criminal. A slightly less sophisticated attacker
might have access to the same kits and exploits once the vulnerability has been publicly disclosed, but prior to
there being a security patch issued for them. While from time to time various methods of generating malicious
PDFs and other document types will appear on websites like the Metasploit (www.metasploit.com) and milw0rm (www.milw0rm.com), the vast majority of these exploits and kits are not available publicly.
The ability to successfully compromise a target relies on more than just code designed to exploit vulnerabilities
in software – it requires “exploiting the human element” as well (Nolan and Levesque 2005). The digital traces
individuals leave behind on the Internet can be used to manipulate trust, and are used by attackers to encourage
targets to execute malicious code on their systems. The first phase of a targeted attack usually involves an
“information acquisition phase,” in which information on potential targets is compiled from a variety of public
sources, including social and professional networking sites, conference proceedings, academic papers and project
information, in order to generate a profile of the target (Smith and Toppel 2009).
Targeted malware attacks often leverage publicly available information to make their social engineering attempts
more plausible. Individuals are much more likely to become victims of targeted attacks if malware is sent to
them from what appears to be an acquaintance or a colleague (Jagatic et al. 2007). Targeted malware attacks
are, in many cases, personalised at the individual or organizational level. Moreover, an attacker may leverage
the credentials of a previously compromised acquaintance to add increased levels of legitimacy to the attack. As
a result, the attackers are able to convince the target into executing malicious code on their own computer, thus

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 3: MAPPING THE SHADOWS IN THE CLOUD

17

resulting in the attackers gaining full control.
Typically, a user receives an email, possibly appearing to be from someone that they know who is a real person
within his or her organization, with some text — sometimes specific, sometimes generic — that urges the user
to open an attachment (or visit a web site), usually a PDF or Microsoft Office document (e.g., DOC, PPT, XLS
and others). These attacks may be spoofed or even come from the real email account of someone else who
has fallen victim to a similar attack, in what can be called a man-in-the-mailbox attack (Markoff and Barboza
2010). If the user opens the attachment with a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader or Microsoft Office (other
types of software are also being exploited) and no other mitigations are in place, their computer will likely be
compromised (F-Secure 2010). A clean version of the document is typically embedded in the malicious file and
is opened upon successful exploitation, so as not to arouse suspicion of the recipient. What is done next is then
only limited to the imagination and abilities of the attacker.
In a recent report, Symantec’s Message Labs revealed that the bulk of the targeted email attacks that they
have studied originates from the PRC (28.2%), Romania (21.1%) and the United States (13.8%). Leveraging
business-related information or popular topics in the news, the attackers largely target those with a “a high or
medium ranking seniority” within an organization. The most freguently targeted individuals include defence
policy experts, diplomatic missions, and human rights activists and researchers (Symantec 2010). The antivirus
detection for these documents is usually relatively low, and if the exploit is a 0day — an exploit for which there
is no fix from the vendor available — the chances of compromise are very good.
In the attacks documented in this report, the user’s computer checks in with a command and control server
after it is compromised. Our attackers used free services from various providers to instruct infected systems to
beacon to new command and control servers that were setup and fully managed by them. This check-in or beaconing activity is conducted using an HTTP connection and blends in with normal web traffic. When beaconing
the compromised computer sends some information, usually its IP address and operating system information,
and receives a command which it then executes. At this point the attacker has full control of the user’s system.
The attacker can steal documents, email and send other data, or force the compromised computer to download
additional malware and possibly use the infected computer as a mechanism to exploit the victim’s contacts
or other computers on the target network. In our examination of the network, it appeared systems were most
frequently instructed to upload documents and download additional executables.

3.2.2 Malicious Documents and Command and Controls
While we only have limited insight into the motivations and methods of the attackers, we believe they infected
victims primarily via email using social engineering techniques to convince their victims to open malicious file
attachments, as described above. The people behind the Shadow attacks used a variety of exploits and filetypes
to compromise their victims. We observed the group using PDF, PPT, and DOC file formats to exploit Adobe
Acrobat and Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Word 2003 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2003. The themes of their attacks
appear to involve topics that would likely be of interest to the Indian and Tibetan communities. This can be
observed through the file names of the malicious exploit files, as well as looking at the clean or non-malicious
files they then open after exploitation.
We were able to obtain dozens of exploit files that were used by the attackers when targeting their victims.
The Microsoft Word 2003 and PowerPoint 2003 files were mostly older exploits, which have been circulating in
the underground hacker community for some time. The PDF files, on the other hand, took advantage of much
more recent exploits at the time of their use. We observed them using PDF files that exploited CVEs 2009-0927,

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 3: MAPPING THE SHADOWS IN THE CLOUD

18

2009-2990, and 2009-4324 within a few weeks or months of the vulnerability being first patched. Our research
did not reveal them using exploits that were 0day at the time, but we only have limited insight into their attacks
and may have easily not been privy to information from such attacks at the time. It is also worth noting that the
exploits they used in their attacks are not generated from freely available tools or publicly posted exploit code.
Our attacks appear to have some level of access to PPT, DOC, and PDF exploit generation kits that allow them
to create exploit files on the fly that install their malware.
Table 2 below is a sampling of each of the malicious document file formats that we observed and analyzed that
were used by these attackers in targeted attacks.

3.2.3 Malicious Binaries found on Command and Controls
During our investigation we were able to acquire twenty-seven malicious binaries used by the attackers. While
many of them contain functionality similar to the malicious payload of the document types enumerated above
as well as common command and control server locations there were several binaries whose functionality differed significantly.
We discovered that two of the binaries were using Yahoo! Mail accounts as an element of command and control. More specifically, in addition to checking in with the Yahoo! Mail accounts, new malicious binaries were
pushed to the compromised computers from the email account.

binary hosted on sites.google.com/site/wwwfox99/.
This malware sample connected to a command and control server and downloaded additional components
(docBack.gif, nscthttp.gif, top.gif, tor.gif) that allowed it to connect to the Tor anonymity network. The reason
behind the attackers integration of Tor into their malware remains unclear.

Tor (www.torproject.org) is an anonymity system that defends users from traffic analysis attacks in which
attackers attempt to monitor users’ online behaviour. Tor is used by journalists, human rights advocates, and
those in locations that are subject to Internet censorship. It is also used by law enforcement and many others
who require anonymity.
In 2007, a computer security researcher, Dan Egerstad collected data and email login credentials for a variety of
embassies around the world by monitoring the traffic exiting from Tor exit nodes, an anonymous communications
network. He was able to obtain user names and passwords for a variety of email accounts, and recovered data associated with the Dalai Lama’s office as well as India’s Defence Research and Development Organization (Zetter 2007a).
Tor does not automatically encrypt everything that a user does online. Unless the end-point of a connection
is encrypted, the data passing through an exit node in the Tor network will be in plain text. Since anyone can
operate a Tor exit node, it is possible for a malicious user to intercept the plain text communications passing
through it. However, Egerstad believes that the entities whose credentials and data he was able to collect were not
using Tor themselves. Rather, he concluded that attackers may have been using the Tor network as a mechanism
to exfiltrate data:
The embassy employees were likely not using Tor nor even knew what Tor was. Instead, we suspected
that the traffic he sniffed belonged to someone who had hacked the accounts and was eavesdropping on
them via the Tor network. As the hacked data passed through Egerstad’s Tor exit nodes, he was able to
read it as well (Zetter 2007b).

On one of the command and control severs, we also discovered that the attackers were using Enfal, a well
known Trojan. The malware connected to www.indexnews.org and requested the following file paths: /cgi-bin/

significance of use of Enfal in section 3.3.1 below.

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 3: MAPPING THE SHADOWS IN THE CLOUD

21

The attackers’ command and control infrastructure consists of three interrelated components. The first
component consists of intermediaries that simply contain links, which can be updated, to command and control
servers. During our investigation we found that such intermediaries included Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot,
Baidu Blogs, and blog.com. The attackers also used Yahoo! Mail accounts as a command and control component
in order to send new malicious binaries to compromised computers. On at least one occasion the attackers also
used Google Pages to host malware. To be clear, the attackers were misusing these systems, not exploiting any
vulnerability in these platforms. In total, we found three Twitter accounts, five Yahoo! Mail accounts, twelve
Google Groups, eight Blogspot blogs, nine Baidu blogs, one Google Sites and sixteen blogs on blog.com that were
being used as part of the attacker’s infrastructure. The attackers simply created accounts on these services and
used them as a mechanism to update compromised computers with new command and control server information. Even a vigilant network administrator looking for rogue connections exiting the network may overlook
such connections as they are routine and generally considered to be safe web sites. The use of social networking platforms, blogs and other services offered by trusted companies allows the attackers to maintain control
of compromised computers even if direct connections to the command and control servers are blocked at the
firewall level. The compromised computers can simply be updated through these unblocked intermediaries to
point to a new, as yet unknown, control server.
Such techniques are not new per se, and nothing in and of itself was invented by the Shadow attackers that had
not been done before (See Box 3). Rather, the attackers are learning from the experiences of others and adapting
the techniques to meet their needs. By using these kind of intermediaries and platforms, the attackers are able
to conceal their activities and maintain a resilient command and control infrastructure. In the Shadow case, the
attackers did not rely on only one social networking, cloud computing or Web 2.0 service, but rather used a
variety of such services in combination with one another.
Box 3: Social Network Sites as Control Channels for Malware Networks
The use of social networking sites as elements of command and control for malware networks is not novel. The attackers
leverage the normal operation of these systems in order to maintain control over compromised system. In 2009,
researchers found that Twitter, Jaiku, Tumblr, Google Groups, Google AppEngine and Facebook had all been used as the
command and control structure for malware. In August 2009, Arbor Networks’ Jose Nazario found that Twitter was being
used as a command and control component for a malware network. In this case, the malware was an information stealer
focused on extracting banking credentials from compromised computers located mostly in Brazil. Twitter was not the only
channel being used by the attackers. They also used accounts on Jaiku and Tumblr (Nazario 2009a). Furthermore, Arbor
Networks found another instance of malware that used the Google AppEngine to deliver malicious URLs to compromised
computers (Nazario 2009b). The Unmask Parasites blog found that obfuscated scripts embedded in compromised web
sites used the Twitter API to obscure their activities. While the method was clever, the code was unreliable and appeared
to have been abandoned by the attackers (Unmask Parasites 2009). Symantec found that Google Groups were being
used as command and control for another instance of malware. In this case, a private Google group was used by the
attackers to send commands to compromised computers which then uploaded their responses to the same Group
(Symantec 2009a) Symantec also found an instance of malware that used Facebook status messages as a mechanism
of command and control. (Symantec 2009b). The use of these social networking and Web 2.0 tools allows the attackers
to leverage the normal operation of these tools to obscure the command and control functions of malware.

One platform leveraged by the attackers in particularly interesting ways was the webmail service provided by
Yahoo!. We discovered five Yahoo! Mail accounts being used by the attackers as a component of command and
control. Once a computer was compromised, the malware connected to the Yahoo! Mail accounts using Yahoo’s
API and created a unique folder in the Inbox of the mail account, into which an email was inserted containing
the computer’s name, operating system and IP address. The attacker would then send an email to the account
containing a command or a command along with additional malware as an attachment. The next time that a

compromised computer checks in with the email account, it then downloads and executes the malicious attachment. Upon execution, the compromised computer placed an acknowledgement mail in the Yahoo! Mail Inbox.
The email addresses used by the attackers were:






zhengwai@yahoo.com
wwwfoxperter@yahoo.com
swwwfox@yahoo.in
ctliliwoy5@yahoo.com
sonamtenphel@yahoo.com

The attackers used these Yahoo! Mail accounts as command and control in conjunction with traditional mechanisms, such as HTTP connections to web servers. Therefore, even if the traditional web-based command and
control channels were shut down the attacker could retain control using the Yahoo! Mail mechanism.
Moreover, the web-based component of command and control was also resilient. We found that command and
control servers were being operated on free hosting sites and on free domain providers such co.tv and net.ru.
We found command and control servers on the following free web hosting providers:

As some of the free hosting accounts became unavailable, the attacker’s modified blog posts on the intermediaries to point to new command and control servers, most often to servers that appear to be the core of the
network. The core command and control servers reside on domain names that appear to be registered by the
attackers themselves and on dedicated servers. These control servers are:

All of these domain names are hosted in the PRC.
The first group of domain names (c2etejs.com, erneex.com, idefesvn.com, jdusnemsaz.com, peose.com) were
all hosted on the same IP address ­— 119.84.4.43 — but moved to another IP address ­— 210.51.7.155 — which
is associated with the more well known domain names indexindian.com and tibetcommunication.com. The
domains indexnews.org and lookbytheway.net are on 61.188.87.27, microsoftnews.net is on 61.188.87.79, and
intoplink.com is on 60.160.182.113. The domains indexindian.com, indexnews.org and lookbytheway.net are
well known malware domain names associated with more than one instance of malware.

3.3.1 Malware Connections: Enfal
One of our objectives in this report was to explore the broader ecosystem of malware. While analysis of individual
attacks may yield interesting data, a broader understanding of connections between malware networks allows us
to better understand the methods, targets and capabilities of the attackers. Based on the malware tools and
command and control infrastructure collected as part of the Shadows in the Cloud investigation we were able to
draw connections between the Shadow network and at least two other, possibly affiliated, malware networks.
When grouping malware networks together we interpret relationships between the command and control
infrastructures, characteristics of the malware, attack vectors and exploits used, and any identifying information
left behind by the attackers. This allows us to track the activities of similar yet distinct groups of attackers over
time. More importantly, this historical perspective allows us to apply a granular level of analysis when investigating attacks, rather than simply grouping attackers and malware together by the country of origin. When
grouping malware we focus on:
 IP address relationships - the historical relationship between command and control domains that resolve to
same IP addresses over time.

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 3: MAPPING THE SHADOWS IN THE CLOUD

24

 Malware connection relationships - malware found on one command and control server that connects to a
different command and control server.
 Malware file path relationships - the presence of distinctive file paths on multiple command and control
servers.
There are limitations to this approach. For example, multiple attackers could operate on a common infrastructure, perhaps supplied by a group that specialises in malicious hosting or selling registered domain names to
be used as command and control servers. Different groups of attackers could use the same, or very similar,
malware. However, when the malware is not publicly available or for sale, its use remains limited.
During the Shadow investigation we found the Enfal trojan among the instances of malware used by the attackers. The Enfal trojan is not widely available and appears to be in use by affiliated malware networks that
sometimes share a common command and control infrastructure.
In fact, domain names that have been used as Enfal command and control servers by separate, but possibly
affiliated, attackers — assam2008.net, msnxy.net, sysroots.net, womanld.com, womannana.com, lookbyturns.
com, macfeeresponse.com and macfeeresponse.org — have now been incorporated into our sinkhole project.
This allows us to observe compromised computers that are still checking in with the command and control
servers as well as the file paths being requested. In some cases, we can obtain the names of documents located on the compromised computers. These domain names are associated with Enfal and can also be linked
to the active command and control servers in the Shadow network through common command and control
server IP addresses.
Another group of attackers that also used the Enfal trojan were documented in 2008 by Maarten Van
Horenbeeck. He published information concerning his investigation into the targeted malware attacks which
included the use of the Enfal Trojan dating back to 2007. Van Horenbeeck systematically documented a series
of targeted attacks and clearly articulated the methodology of the attackers, one of which is now commonplace.
The attackers leverage social engineering tactics to entice the target into clicking on a malicious link or email
attachment. The malware then exploits a vulnerability in the user’s client side software, such as a browser,
Microsoft Word, Adobe Reader and so on, and begins communicating with a command and control server. Enfal
is recognisable due to the consistent filenames the malware requests from the command and control server,
most notably “/cgi-bin/owpq4.cgi”. Van Horenbeeck identified domain names used by Enfal, *.bluewinnt.
com and *.ggsddup.com, which are still in use today (Van Horenbeeck 2008a; Van Horenbeeck 2008b; Van
Horenbeeck 2007).
While we were unable to find any instances of common command and control infrastructure between the Enfal
network that Van Horenbeeck documented, the methods and tools of these attackers and the Shadow network
are very similar. The common use of the Enfal Trojan suggests that the attackers may be exchanging tools and
techniques. The profile of the victims from two separate Enfal-based networks in our DNS sinkhole suggest
that the attackers have an interest in compromising similar sets of targets. Finally, the failed DNS resolution for
www.assam2008.net found on a computer at the OHHDL also compromised by the Shadow network indicates a
possibly closer connection, or that they at least have both common tools and target sets.

Compromised Victims: The Evidence

Mistakes on the part of the attackers allowed us to view the attackers’ list of victims at four command and
control locations. In addition, we were able to recover exfiltrated data from two locations. This provided us with
a snapshot of the computers that have been compromised by the attacks. Thus, this is not a complete list of all
those compromised by this attacker. Rather, it is simply those checking in with or uploading data to the portions
of the network that we were able to view. Moreover, there was considerable overlap between different methods
of command and control, with individual computers checking in at multiple locations. Therefore, we do not
have consistent data across all compromised computers. There are two categories of victims: those for whom
we only have technical identifying information, such as IP addresses; and those from whom we have recovered
exfiltrated data but for whom we do not have IP addresses. In cases where we do not have IP addresses, the
identity of the victim is determined from the contextual information found within the exfiltrated data itself.
We obtained information on victims from:
 a web-based interface that lists cursory information on compromised computers located on one command
and control server;
 text files in web-accessible directories on three command and control servers that list detailed information
on compromised computers;
 information obtained from email accounts used for command and control of compromised computers
 information obtained from one command and control server from which we retrieved exfiltrated documents
(but not necessarily technical identifying information);
 information obtained from our DNS sinkhole.
The primary method of identification used in this section is based upon the IP address of the compromised
computer. We looked up the associated IP address in all five Regional Internet Registries (RiR) in order to identify the country and network to which the IP address is assigned. We then performed a reverse Domain Name
System (DNS) look-up on each IP address. DNS is the system that translates domain names into IP addresses;
reverse DNS is a system that translates an IP address into a domain name. This can potentially provide additional information about the entity that has been assigned a particular IP address. If we discovered a domain
name, we then looked up its registration in WHOIS, which is a public database of all domain name registrations
and provides information about who registered the domain name.
It was possible to identify the geographic location of the compromised computer at the country level as well as
the network to which the IP address was assigned. However, in most cases there was little information in the
RiRs pertaining to the exact identity of the compromised entity. Where possible, we note the entity identified by
data obtained from the RiRs.
The following list of compromised computers was generated by parsing information from unique victims, not
solely IP addresses. The attackers assign the compromised computer a name based on the host name of the computer, which allows us to identify unique victims rather than relying only on IP addresses. In fact, several of the
unique victims have multiple IP addresses associated with them, sometimes spanning multiple countries. Here we
have generated a geographic breakdown based on the first IP addresses recorded for each compromised computer.

Figure 4:
Locations of Compromised Computers in the Shadow Network

While there is considerable geographic diversity, there is a high concentration of compromised computers
located in India. However, we were only able to identify two of the compromised entities:
 Embassy of India, United States
 Embassy of Pakistan, United States

4.1.1 Sinkhole
A DNS sinkhole server is a system that is designed to take requests from a botnet or infected systems and record
the incoming information. The sinkhole server is not under the control of the malware authors and can be used
to gain an understanding of a botnet’s operation. There are a few different techiques that are used to sinkhole
botnet traffic. The easiest method is to simply register an expired domain that was previously used to control
victim systems. Being able to do this generally indicates the botnet operator has lost control of the domain, forgotten to renew it, or that the botnet has been abandoned. Another method focuses on reverse-engineering the
malware to determine if it has “fail over” command and control servers or special methods to compute future
domains. This may require that a domain name generation algorithm be discovered and that one must register
the domain names before the attacker does (Stone-Gross et al. 2009).
During the GhostNet investigation we found that a computer at the OHHDL was compromised by both the
GhostNet and what we are now calling the Shadow network. We had a list of serveral domains that were
expiring that we had linked to attacks against OHHDL. We were able to register several of these domain names
in order to gather information about the network’s command and control infrastructure, communication methods,

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 4: TARGETS & EFFECTS

28

and victim systems. We were able to register and monitor four of the domain names mentioned in Tracking
GhostNet. In addition, we were able to register several others which we linked to the Shadow network along
with one, www.assam2008.net, which we believe to be yet another separate, but possibly affiliated, network.

We were able to observe the file paths associated with malware that were requested by compromised computers. In total, we found that during this period 6,902 unique IPs requested paths associated with the malware
that used these hosts as command and control servers. However, counting the number of infected hosts purely
by IP addresses is problematic. In fact, botnets are generally much smaller than the total sum of unique IP
addresses would suggest (Stone-Gross et al. 2009; Rajab et al. 2007). This network, which is focused on stealing
documents from specific targets, is expected to be small in size.

Victim Analysis on the Basis of
Recovered Documents

In total we recovered data from 44 compromised computers. The documents recovered from the OHHDL were
reconstructed from captured network traffic, while the remainder were retrieved from an open directory on
one command and control server. Only seven of the remaining 43 compromised computers (not counting the
OHHDL computer) for which we were able to recover exfiltrated data also checked in with the same control
server. Therefore we can only identify the IP addresses of these seven computers. Five of these seven computers
have IP addresses that are assigned to India, while the remaining two are assigned to Thailand and the PRC. As
noted below, the Chinese IP address represents the attacks on IP addresses along with two test (junk) text files
that appear to have been used for testing the malware.
We determined the country and entity from which the documents were exfiltrated based on the content of the
documents themselves in cases where we did not obtain an IP address. In addition, we assigned two country
codes to the compromised computers: one country code indicates the physical (IP) country in which the computer is located, and the second country code indicates the country of ownership. Thus a compromised computer at a foreign embassy would be assigned a country code based on its geographical region, and a second
based on the home country to which the foreign mission belongs.
Based on geographic location, the vast majority are in India.

4.3.1 Targets
Diplomatic Missions and Government Entities
Diplomatic missions and government entities exchange sensitive information, which sometimes finds its
way onto unclassified systems. During our investigation, we recovered documents that are extremely sensitive from a national security perspective as well as documents that contain sensitive information that could
be exploited by an adversary for intelligence purposes. We recovered one document that appears to be an
encrypted diplomatic correspondence, two documents classified as “SECRET”, six as “RESTRICTED”, and five
as “CONFIDENTIAL”. These documents contain sensitive information taken from a member of the National
Security Council Secretariat concerning secret assessments of India’s security situation in the states of Assam,
Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura, as well as concerning the Naxalites and Maoists. In addition, they contain
confidential information taken from Indian embassies regarding India’s international relations with and assessments of activities in West Africa, Russia/Commonwealth of Independent States and the Middle East, as well as
visa applications, passport office circulars and diplomatic correspondence. The attackers also exfiltrated detailed

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 4: TARGETS & EFFECTS

33

personal information regarding a member of the Directorate General of Military Intelligence. These compromises
and the character of the data exfiltrated extends to non-governmental targets as well. Some of the academics
and journalists that were compromised were interested in and regularly reporting on sensitive topics such as
Jammu and Kashmir.
National Security and Defence
During our investigations we suspected that a variety of military computers had been compromised as well as
the computers of defence-oriented academics and journals. While none of the information obtained was classified, the documents we recovered reveal information regarding sensitive topics. Although there is public information available on these miltary projects, it indicates that the attackers managed to compromise the right set
of individuals that may have knowledge of these systems that is not publicly known. We recovered documents
and presentations relating to the following projects:
 Pechora Missile System - an anti-aircraft surface-to-air missile system.
 Iron Dome Missile System - a mobile missile defence system (Ratzlav-Katz 2010).
 Project Shakti - an artillery combat command and control system (Frontier India 2009).
We also found that documents relating to network centricity (SP’s Land Forces 2008) and network-centric
warfare had been exfiltrated, along with documents detailing plans for intelligence fusion and technologies for
monitoring and analysing network data (Defence Research and Development Organisation 2009).
Academics/Journalists focused on the PRC
During our investigations we found that a variety of academic targets had been compromised, including those at
the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) as well as journalists at India Strategic defence magazine
and FORCE magazine. The exfiltrated papers included those discussing the containment of the PRC, Chinese
military exports, and Chinese foreign policy on Taiwan and Sino-Indian relations. More specifically, there were
documents that focused on ethnicity, religion and politics in Central Asia, and the links between armed groups
and the PRC. Although the academic papers exfiltrated by the attackers are publicly available, the content of the
material indicates that the attackers managed to compromise those with a keen interest in the PRC.

4.3.2 Affected Institutions
During our investigations we found that a variety of personal information belonging to individuals had been
compromised. This included various lists of contacts along with their personal details that could be used by the
attackers. It also included information about travel, including air and rail tickets, receipts, invoices and other
billing information. In addition we found personal banking information, scans of identification documents,
job (and other) applications, legal documents and information about ongoing court cases. The attackers also
exfiltrated personal email communications. All of this information can be leveraged for future attacks, especially
attacks against those within the compromised individual’s social network.
 National Security Council Secretariat, India
The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) of India is comprised of the Joint Intelligence Committee
and is a component of the National Security Council established in 1998 along with a Strategic Policy
Group and an Advisory Board. The National Security Council is headed by the Prime Minister of India and
is responsible for strategic planning in the area of national security (Subrahmanyam 2010; Indian Embassy
1998). We assess that a computer at the NSCS was compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the
attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, fourteen documents, including two documents marked “SECRET,” were exfiltrated. In addition to documents containing the personal and financial

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 4: TARGETS & EFFECTS

34

information of what appears to be the compromised individual, the exfiltrated documents focus on India’s
security situation in the states of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura as well as the Naxalites, Maoists,
and what is referred to as “left wing extremism.”
 Diplomatic Missions, India
India maintains numerous diplomatic missions abroad that provide consular services relating to passports
and visas as well as faciltaing trade, commerce and engaging in diplomatic relations (Indian government
2010). We assess that computers at the Embassy of India, Kabul, the Embassy of India, Moscow, the
Consulate General of India, Dubai, and the High Commission of India in Abuja, Nigeria were compromised
based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers,
99 documents, including what appears to be one encrypted diplomatic correspondence as well as five documents marked “RESTRICTED” and four documents marked “CONFIDENTIAL,” were exfiltrated. In addition
to documents containing personal, financial, and travel information on embassy and diplomatic staff, the
exfiltrated documents included numerous visa applications, passport office circulars, and country assessments and reports. Confidential visa applications from citizens of Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, the PRC,
Croatia, Denmark, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Philippines, Senegal, Switzerland, Uganda,
and the United Kingdom were among the exfiltrated documents.
 Military Engineer Services, India
The Military Engineer Services (MES) is a government construction agency that provides services to the
Indian Army, Navy and Air Force. In addition, the MES services the government sector and civil works projects.
We assess that computers at the MES-Bengdubi, MES-Kolkata, MES(AF)-Bangalore, and MES-Jalandhar were
compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored
the attackers, 78 documents were exfiltrated. While these documents included manuals and forms that would
not be considered sensitive, they also included documents that contained private information on personnel,
and documents and presentations concerning the financing and scheduling of specific engineering projects.
 Military Personnel, India
We assess that computers linked with the 21 Mountain Artillery Brigade in the state of Assam, the Air Force
Station, Race Course, New Delhi and the Air Force Station, Darjipura Vadodara, Gujarat were compromised
based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers,
sixteen documents were exfiltrated. One document contained personal information on Saikorian alumni of
the Sainik School, Korukonda, which prepares students for entry into the National Defence Academy. One
document is a detailed briefing on a live fire exercise while others pertain to surface-to-air missile systems
and moving target indicators.
 Military Educational Institutions, India
We assess that computers at the Army Institute of Technology in Pune, Maharashtra and the Military College
of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering in Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh were compromised based on
the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, twentyone documents, including one marked “RESTRICTED”, were exfiltrated. There are documents and presentations detailing the finances of one of the institutions as well as personal and private information on students
and their travel. There is also a document that describes “Project Shakti,” the Indian Army’s command and
control system for artillery (India Defence 2007).
 Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, India
We assess that computers at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) were compromised based
on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, 187
documents were exfiltrated. While many of the documents were published papers from a variety of academic
sources, there were internal documents, such as an overview of the IDSA research agenda, minutes of

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 4: TARGETS & EFFECTS

35

meetings for the Journal of Defence Studies, budgets and information on a variety of speakers, visitors, and
conference participants.
 Defence-oriented publications, India
We assess that computers at the India Strategic defence magazine and FORCE magazine were compromised
based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers,
58 documents were exfiltrated. While these documents include publicly accessible articles and previous
drafts of those articles, there is also private information regarding the contact details of subscribers and conference participants. The documents also include interviews, documents, and PowerPoint presentations from
conferences that detail national security topics, such as network data and monitoring for national security,
and responses to combat cyber threats.
 Corporations, India
We assess that computers at YKK India Private Limited, DLF Limited, and TATA were compromised based
on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, five
documents were exfiltrated. These documents include rules overseeing busiiness travel, a presentation on
roadmap and financial status, and an annual plan for a business partnership.
 Maritime, India
We assess that computers at the National Maritime Foundation and the Gujarat Chemical Port Terminal
Company Limited were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period
in which we monitored the attackers, 53 documents were exfiltrated. These documents include a summary
of a seminar as well as numerous documents relating to specific shipping schedules, financial matters and
personal medical information.
 United Nations
The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) is based in
Thailand and facilitates development in the Asia-Pacific region. We assess that a computer at UNESCAP has
been compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. In addition to information concerning a variety of conferences and presentations, there were also internal Mission Report documents regarding
travel and events in the region.

PART 5:
Tackling Cyber Espionage

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 5: TACKLING CYBER ESPIONAGE

37

5.1 Attribution and Cyber Crime / Cyber Espionage
During this investigation we collected malware samples used by the attackers, which were primarily PDFs that
exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. In addition, we collected malware used by the attackers after successfully compromising a targeted system as well as network traffic captured from the OHHDL.
We were able to map out the command and control infrastructure of the attackers and in several cases view
data that allowed us to identify targets that had been compromised and recover exfiltrated documents. We did
not have access to data regarding specific attacks on any of the targets we have identified. In other words, we
cannot definitely tell how any one individual target was compromised. And, more importantly, we do not have
data regarding the behaviour of the attackers once inside the target’s network.
However, we do have two key pieces of information: the first is an email address used in a document in the
attackers’ possession that provided steps on how the attackers could use Yahoo! Mail as a command and control
server; the second is the IP addresses used by the attackers to send emails from Yahoo! Mail accounts used as
command and control servers.
Email addresses used by the attackers have proven to provide critical clues in past investigations. Following the
release of the GhostNet investigation, The Dark Visitor — a blog that researches Chinese hacking activities —
investigated one of the email addresses we published that was used to register the domain names the attackers
utilized as command and control servers. While these were not GhostNet domain names, one of them is the
same as one used by the attackers in this investigation: lookbytheway.net (Henderson 2009a).
The email address used to register lookbytheway.net is losttemp33@hotmail.com. The Dark Visitor found
forum posts made by losttemp33@hotmail.com, who also used the alias “lost33.” Further searching revealed “an
individual who was associated with Xfocus, Isbase,” two popular Chinese hacking forums, and “seems to have
studied under Glacier” (Henderson 2009b). Glacier is known as “Godfather of the Chinese Trojan” (Henderson
2007a), and an association with him indicates lost33’s connections to the hacking underground in the PRC. Using
information found on lost33’s blog, The Dark Visitor was able to find another blog used by lost33, now operating
under the alias “damnfootman”, and had a text chat conversation with him on the Chinese instant messenger
service QQ, where the individual admitted to being the owner of the email address losttemp33@hotmail.com.
From this information, The Dark Visitor was able to determine this individual has connections to the forums of
Xfocus and Isbase (the Green Army), NSfocus and Eviloctal, as well as connections to the hackers Glacier and
Sunwear. He was born on July 24, 1982, lives in Chengdu, Sichuan, and attended the University of Electronic
Science and Technology of China, which is also located in Chengdu.
Our investigation also indicated strong links to Chengdu, Sichuan. The attacker used Yahoo! Mail accounts as command and control servers, from which the attacker sent emails containing new malware to the already compromised
targets. All of the IP addresses the attacker used when sending these emails are located in Chengdu, Sichuan.
We were able to retrieve a document from the attackers that indicated the steps neccessary to use Yahoo! Mail
accounts as command and control servers. There was also an account used by the attackers in this document
for testing purposes. Searches for this email address returned several advertisements for apartment rentals in
Chengdu, Sichuan.

The infrastructure of this particular network is tied to individuals in Chengdu, Sichuan. At least one of these individuals has ties to the underground hacking community in the PRC and to the University of Electronic Science
and Technology of China in Chengdu. Interestingly, when the Honker Union of China, one of the largest hacking groups in the PRC, was re-established in 2005, its new leader was a student at the University of Electronic
Science and Technology in Chengdu. Chengdu is also the location of one of the People’s Liberation Army
(PLA)’s technical reconnaissance bureaus tasked with signals intelligence collection. While it would be disingenuous to ignore these correlations entirely, they are loose at best and certainly do not meet the requirements
of determining motivation and attribution. However, the links between the command and control infrastructure
and individuals in the PRC provide a variety of scenarios that point toward attribution.

5.1.2 Patriotic Hacking
The PRC has a vibrant hacker community that has been tied to targeted attacks in the past, and has been linked
through informal channels to elements of the Chinese state, although the nature and extent of the connections
remains unclear. One common theme regarding attribution relating to attacks emerging from the PRC concerns
variations of a privateering model, in which the state authorizes private persons to perform attacks against
enemies of the state. This model emerged because studies have shown that there is no direct government control over the loosely connected groups of hackers in the PRC (Henderson 2007b). Even within the privateering
approach there is much dispute regarding the exact relationship. The degrees of the reported relationship vary
between “authorize” to “tacit consent” to “tolerate” (Henderson 2007b).
However, this ambiguous relationship does not mean that there is no connection between the activities of
Chinese hackers and the state. The PRC’s intelligence collection is based on the gathering of bits of information
across a broad range of sources:
China relies on a broad informal network of students, tourists, teachers, and foreign workers inside of
host nations to collect small bits of information to form a composite picture of the environment. Rather
than set a targeted goal for collection, they instead rely on sheer weight of information to form a clear
understanding of the situation. (Henderson 2007b)

As a result, information that is independently obtained by the Chinese hacker community is likely to find its
way to elements within the Chinese state. However, the Chinese state is not monolithic. It is a complex entity
that includes cooperation and competition amoung a variety of entities, including the Communist Party, the PLA
and the Government of China. In addition, within each of those entities there are factions and rivalries. Further
complicating matters is that there are reported relationships between the edges of the government and networks
of organized crime in the PRC, as in many other countries (Bakken 2005; Keith and Lin 2005). These complex
relationships further complicate our understanding of the connections between the Chinese hacker community
and the Chinese state.
While the PLA is developing computer network operations (CNO), as are the armed forces of a wide variety of
countries, its relationship with the hacker community appears to be minimal, as a recent study reports:
Little evidence exists in open sources to establish firm ties between the PLA and China’s hacker community,
however, research did uncover limited cases of apparent collaboration between more elite individual
hackers and the PRC’s civilian security services. The caveat to this is that amplifying details are extremely
limited and these relationships are difficult to corroborate. (Northrop Grumman 2009)

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 5: TACKLING CYBER ESPIONAGE

39

Moreover, the same study found that there is nothing that “suggests that the PLA or state security bureaus intend
to use hacktivist attacks as a component of a CNO campaign” (Northrop Grumman 2009). In addition, there are
a variety of factors, such as the lack of command and control, precision targeting and the inability to maintain
surprise and deception, that argue against the use of non-state hackers as part of the PLA’s CNO strategy.
In fact, the relations between the hacker community and the state is more likely to be a concern of the Ministry
of Public Security (Northrop Grumman 2009; Henderson 2007b). Interestingly, the Ministry of Public Security
has focused primarily on internal security matters, which links with the emphasis on the Tibet-related targets
documented in this report. (the PRC views Tibet as an internal problem.)

5.2.2 Cyber Crime
The activity of cyber criminals in the PRC parallels the activities of cyber criminals around the globe. The
Chinese hacker community has been known to engage in criminal activities, primarily motivated by profit.
Acting independently of state direction, they are involved in the buying and selling of malware, theft of intellectual
property, theft of gaming credentials, fraud, blackmail, music and video piracy, and pornography (Henderson
2007b). This activity is complex and further obfuscated by the move of Eastern European-based criminal
networks into Chinese cyberspace (Vass 2007). Researchers have identified several core components of the
cyber crime ecosystem in the PRC:
 Malware Authors – motivated by profit and/or stature within the blackhat community, malware authors leverage their technical skills to create and distribute exploits (including 0day vulnerabilities) as well as trojan
horse programs. Their services are often advertised on discussion forums.
 Website Masters/Crackers – by maintaining malicious websites, exploiting vulnerable websites and providing hosting for the command and control capabilities of trojans, the website masters/crackers provide the
infrastructure for cybercrime in the PRC
 “Envelopes” Stealers – focus on acquiring username and password pairs, known as envelopes, through the
use of malware kits, which are then sold. They operate and maintain networks of infected computers but
purchase services from malware authors and website masters/crackers to compensate for their general lack
of technical skill.
 Virtual Asset Stealers/Sellers – by exploiting their knowledge of the underground economy, virtual asset
stealers/sellers purchase compromised credentials from envelopes stealers and sell virtual assets to online
games players, QQ users and others who drive the demand for stolen virtual goods (Choo 2008; Thibodeau
2010; Zhuge et al. 2009).
In additional to politically sensitive information, we did find that personal information, including banking
information, was exfiltrated by the attackers. It is possible that in addition to exploiting the politically sensitive
information the attacks may have also had an interest in exploiting the financial data that was stolen although
we have no direct knowledge of such events occurring.

5.2.3 Overall Assessment
Attribution concerning cyber espionage networks is a complex task, given the inherently obscure modus
operandi of the agents or groups under investigation. Cyber criminals aim to mask their identities, and
the networks investigated in this report are dispersed across multiple platforms and national jurisdictions.
Complicating matters further is the politicization of attribution questions, particularly concerning Chinese inten-

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 5: TACKLING CYBER ESPIONAGE

40

tions around information warfare. Clearly this investigation and our analysis tracks back directly to the PRC,
and to known entities within the criminal underground of the PRC. There is also an obvious correlation to be
drawn between the victims, the nature of the documents stolen, and the strategic interests of the Chinese state.
But correlations do not equal causation. It is certainly possible that the attackers were directed in some manner
— either by sub-contract or privateering — by agents of the Chinese state, but we have no evidence to prove
that assertion. It is also possible that the agents behind the Shadow network are operating for motives other
than political espionage, as our investigation and analysis only uncovered a slice of what is undoubtedly
a larger set of networks. Even more remote, but still at least within the realm of possibility, is the false flag
scenario, that another government altogether is masking a political espionage operation to appear as if it is
coming from within the PRC.
Drawing these different scenarios and alternative explanations together, the most plausible explanation, and the
one supported by the evidence, is that the Shadow network is based out of the PRC by one or more individuals
with strong connections to the Chinese criminal underground. Given the often murky relationships that can exist
between this underground and elements of the state, the information collected by the Shadow network may end
up in the possession of some entity of the Chinese government.

5.3 Notification
Investigations of malware activity, such as that undertaken as part of the Shadow and GhostNet investigations,
can yield information about the network infrastructure of the attackers, information about those who have been
compromised, and confidential or private documents or other data that may have been exfiltrated without prior
knowledge. Access to this information on all levels raises a number of practical, ethical and legal issues, many
of which are unclear given the embryonic nature of the field of inquiry as a whole.
Throughout this investigation, we have been conscious of these issues and have attempted to meet a professional standard in terms of planning and documenting our steps taken in the process of notification. This
entailed research into existing practices and principles, and engagement with the law enforcement, intelligence
and security communities in a number of countries. We were also conscious of the need to comply with the domestic laws in whose context this investigation was undertaken — namely those of India, the United States and
Canada — as well as principles governing all academic research at the University of Toronto, where the Citizen
Lab is located.
Notification itself can be broken down into several categories, each of which entails complicating factors.
First, there is notification that is required to takedown the command and control infrastructure, typically to the
hosting and service provider companies through which the malware networks operate and on which they are
hosted. Complicating matters, these services can be located in numerous national jurisdictions and subject to a
variety of privacy laws and norms. Second, there are issues around notification of victims, such as governments,
businesses, NGOs and individuals. This type of notification is perhaps the most challenging on ethical, practical
and legal grounds. Notification of governments, for example, can be a very sensitive matter, especially if classified documents are involved or information is retrieved that is relevant to national security concerns. The same
holds true of notification to individuals or businesses. At what point should a researcher notify a victim? Who
within the organization, whether it is a government, a business or an NGO, is the appropriate point of contact
for the notification? What if the notification jeopardizes a third party’s security, or leads to some kind of retaliation or retribution? Should researchers notify law enforcement and intelligence agencies in their own countries
before reaching out to foreign governments?

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 5: TACKLING CYBER ESPIONAGE

41

Existing practices in this area are underdeveloped and largely informal. In part, this reflects the fact that global
cyber security is still an embryonic field. But it also speaks to the very real problem of competitive power
politics at the highest levels of national security, which tend to restrict information sharing in sensitive areas
around cyber crime and espionage. Generally speaking, information sharing among law enforcement and intelligence agencies across borders is tentative at best, with the exception of that which occurs among close allies
with deeply entrenched and long-standing links. Outside of those security communities, notification of services
and governments tends to be restricted to specialist technical communities, telecommunications operators, and
network administrators, if it occurs at all. Consequently, notification of the types referred to above can be ad
hoc and inconsistent, largely contingent on the informal connections among professional communities.
All of these issues were grappled with in the aftermath of the Tracking GhostNet report, and throughout the
course of the Shadow investigation. Our experiences in the aftermath of GhostNet, where notification was left
incomplete, prompted a more deliberate and self-conscious approach with the Shadow investigation. We were
also fortunate to have within our collaboration the experiences of the Shadowserver Foundation, whose counsel
on notification helped in making decisions about timing and contacts.
By the end of November 2009, we were confident in our access to the basic command and control infrastructure
and identification of some of the key documents at hand. Upon the realization that some information about
individual Canadians was compromised, we notified Canadian authorities in December 2009 about the investigation, the compromise of Canadian-related information, and requested assistance on outreach with one of the
victims, namely the Indian government. At the same time, we independently explored whom we might contact
in the Indian government, including making inquiries with Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs. By February
2010, we were able to find on our own what we thought was an appropriate contact in the Indian government, and
gave a detailed notification to the National Technology Research Organization. Our notification for takedown of
the command and control infrastructure came later in the investigation, after we had collected and analyzed all
of the information related to this report, but prior to its release.
Our experiences illustrate the intricate, nuanced and often confusing landscape of global cyber security notification practices. The notification process will continue after the publication of this report.

PART 6:
Conclusions

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 6: CONCLUSIONS

43

Shadows in the Cloud points to a disturbing complex ecosystem of malware. Although malware networks,
cyber crime and espionage have been around for years, the evidence presented here shows how these networks
can be aggressively adaptive systems, multipying and regenerating across multiple vectors and platforms, and
exploting the vulnerabilties within the latest Web 2.0 technologies to expand their reach and impact. Although
there is rich detail to what is uncovered in the Shadow investigation, so much of the origins, architecture and
aims of these networks ultimately remain a mystery and await further investigation and analysis. However, even
with the partial insights and fleeting glimpses acquired here, we can draw some conclusions and implications
for further research, policy and operations.
First, the research here shows, as with Tracking GhostNet, how even a relatively small research sample — in
this case Tibetan organizations — can expand, upon investigation and analysis, into an astonishingly large pool
of victims. The connections drawn out here beg the question of what would emerge if the research began with a
different group, from a different region of the world, with a different target set of compromised actors? Clearly,
an area of methodological advantage for both the Tracking GhostNet and the Shadows in the Cloud investigations was to have access in the field to compromised computers and be able to work outwards in a structured
and systematic fashion, using a combination of technical investigations and data analysis. An area of further
research is to extend such efforts to other locations in other regions of the world. Such investigations may reveal
other malware networks, or entirely new and unanticipated modes of crime and espionage.
Second, Shadows in the Cloud underscores the extent to which the global networked society into which we
have evolved socially, politically, economically, and militarily carries with it an underground ecoystem that is
equally networked, though far less visible to those whom it compromises. Governments, organizations and
other actors around the world have been quick to adopt computerized public and administration systems,
including state security actors. Their investments into these technologies have developed at a much faster rate
than the appropriate security policies and practices (Deibert and Rohozinski 2010).
Although the Government of India was the most victimized according to what we uncovered in Shadows in the
Cloud — and that certainly should yield a major consideration of public policy and security for that country —
observations about India in this respect need to be qualified in at least two ways. First, Shadows in the Cloud
reports only on observations and existing evidence, which by definition remain partial. There could be other
countries victimized, involving these very same malware networks attackers, but of which we are unaware
because of our limited samples. Second, and most importantly, there are numerous other countries and international organizations that are targeted here, perhaps not to the same extent, but targeted and infiltrated nonetheless. We can only infer what type of data was exfiltrated from these other actors that is of strategic value.
Overall, however, the key point to draw is that networked societies can be compromised through networks in
which they are invariably linked and mutually dependent.
Third, and related, Shadows in the Cloud demonstrates clearly the potential for collateral compromise, one
of the key hypotheses informing our research framework. This investigation indicates that data leakage from
malware networks can compromise unwitting third parties who are not initially targeted by the attackers. Data
contained on compromised machines can also contain valuable information on third parties that while on
its own may not be significant, but when pieced together with other information can provide actionable and
operational intelligence. The policy and operational implications of collateral compromise are serious and wideranging, and reinforce that security is only as strong as the weakest link in a chain. In today’s networked world,
such chains are complex, overlapping and dispersed across numerous technological platforms crossing multiple

JR03-2010 Shadows in the Cloud - PART 6: CONCLUSIONS

44

national jurisdictions. Paying attention to domestic cyber security is therefore only a partial solution to a much
wider problem. Today, no country or organization is a secure island in the global sea of information.
Fourth, another implication raised by Shadows in the Cloud is for criminal networks to be repurposed for political
espionage as part of an evolution in signals intelligence. Although our conclusions are necessarily circumscribed
by our lack of complete information in this respect, we may be seeing a blurring of the lines in malware genotypes among crimeware and more politically-motivated attacks. Part of that blurring may be deliberate on the
part of actors wishing to obscure attribution, but part of it may also be a newly emerging and largely organic
market for espionage products that was either contained or nonexistent in the past, and which now supplements the market for industrial espionage. This market may present opportunities for actors that, in turn, produce a refinement in their approach or methodology. Criminal actors may troll for targets widely as a first cut,
triaging among the available sources of information to zero-in on those that yield commercial value on both the
industrial and political espionage markets. Such a development would pose major policy and operational issues,
and accelerate existing trends down the road of cyber privateering.
Finally, a major implication of the findings of Shadows in the Cloud relates to the evolution towards cloud
computing, social networking and peer-to-peer networking technologies that characterize much of the global
networked society today. These new modes of information storage and communication carry with them many
conveniences and so now are fully integrated into personal life, business, government and social organization.
But as shown in the Shadow investigation, these new platforms are also being used as vectors of malware
propagation and command and control (Office of Privacy Commissioner of Canada 2010).
It is often said that dark clouds carry with them silver linings, but in this case the clouds contain within them
a dark hidden core. As we document above, blog hosting sites, social networking forums and mail groups were
turned into support structures and command and control systems for a malignant enterprise. The very same
characteristics of those social networking and cloud platforms which make them so attractive to the legitimate
user — reliability, distribution, redundancy and so forth — were what attracted our attackers to them in setting
up their network. Clouds provide criminals and espionage networks with convenient cover, tiered defences,
redundancy, cheap hosting and conveniently distributed command and control architectures. They also provide
a stealthy and very powerful mode of infiltrating targets who have become accustomed to clicking on links and
opening PDFs and other documents as naturally as opening an office door. What is required now is a much
greater reflection on what it will take, in terms of personal computing, corporate responsibility and government
policy, to acculturate a greater sensibility around cloud security.
