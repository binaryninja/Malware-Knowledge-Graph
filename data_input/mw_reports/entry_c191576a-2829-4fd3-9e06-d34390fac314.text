NetTraveler Spear­Phishing Email Targets Diplomat of Uzbekistan
posted by: Vicky Ray and Robert Falcone on January 21, 2016 8:45 AM
filed in: Malware, Threat Prevention, Unit 42
tagged: AutoFocus, NetTraveler, spearphishing, Trojan, Ufa, Ufe, Uzbekistan, WildFire
Unit 42 recently identified a targeted attack against an individual working for the Foreign Ministry of Uzbekistan in China. A spear­
phishing email was sent to a diplomat of the Embassy of Uzbekistan who is likely based in Beijing, China. In this report, we’ll review
how the actors attempted to exploit CVE­2012­0158 to install the NetTraveler Trojan.
On December 12, 2015, a spear­phishing email was sent to a diplomat of the Embassy of Uzbekistan. The body and subject of the
email suggests that the email was spoofed to look like it was sent by the Russian Foreign Ministry and the attachment may contain an
official annual report on CHS (Council of Heads of Member States), who form the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization).
Filename: “2015.12.11_сроки СГГ 2015 в Уфе.doc.doc” (translated to: “2015.12.11_sroki CHS in 2015 Ufe.doc.doc”)
Body: “С уважением, ДАТС МИД России” (translated to: “Yours faithfully, ACSD Russian Foreign Ministry”)
It is interesting to note the reference of Ufa in the file name, as the city of Ufa in Russia hosted the SCO BRICS Summit on July 9 and
10, 2015. SCO and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) are intergovernmental international organizations focused on
issues of regional security and economic cooperation.

Figure 2 Email containing the malicious attachment
The malicious attachment “2015.12.11_сроки СГГ 2015 в Уфе.doc.doc” is a malicious document created by the MNKit toolkit and
exploits CVE­2012­0158.
Upon successful exploitation, the attachment will install the trojan known as NetTraveler using a DLL side­loading attack technique.
The NetTraveler trojan has been known to be used in targeted cyber espionage attacks for more than a decade by nation state threat
actors and continues to be used to target its victims and exfiltrate data.
The DLL side­loading attack technique has been gaining adoption within the cyber espionage realm by threat actors to bypass
traditional security systems. Unit 42 also published a blog last year discussing an unrelated attack where the DLL side­loading
technique was used.
Figure 3 illustrates the exploitation and the infection flow of the malware.

Figure 3 Overview of the infection flow
The document “2015.12.11_сроки СГГ 2015 в Уфе.doc.doc” exploits CVE­2012­0158 to drop a decoy file “~$.doc” and the actual
payload “DW20.exe”. The decoy is a blank document with the meta data stripped.
The payload (DW20.exe) is a self­extracting (SFX) RAR archive that contains the following files:
RasTls.exe
rastls.dll
Sycmentec.config

Figure 4 The payload(DW20.exe) is a SFX RAR archive
The SFX RAR uses the following configuration to launch the embedded executable, which is a legitimate application created by
Symantec that will side load the rastls.dll DLL:
Setup=RasTls.exe
TempMode
Silent=1
Overwrite=1
The figure below shows that the config file, ‘Sycmentec.config’ is encrypted.
The ‘Sycmentec.config’ file can be decrypted using a single byte XOR algorithm using ‘0x77’ as a key.

Figure 5 Encrypted ‘Sycmentec.config’file
The ‘rastls.dll’ DLL will load and decrypt this file. The decrypted data starts with shellcode that is responsible for loading an embedded
DLL and executing it.
Figure 6 shows the decrypted ‘Sycmentec.config’file containing an embedded DLL.

Table 1 Attributes of the embedded DLL (NetTraveler)
The first execution of this NetTraveler Trojan starts off with an installation process. Like previous versions, this NetTraveler sample
writes its configuration to a file, in this case the configuration is written to a file named “config.dat”.

Figure 7 NetTraveler writes the configuration to ‘config.dat’ file
During execution, NetTraveler creates a mutex of ‘YOYWOW!657’, as shown in Figure 8 below to avoid running multiple instances of
its code.

Figure 8 Mutex created for this NetTraveler payload
The code then enumerates the ‘netsvcs’ services, which are services that run within the process space of svchost.exe, specifically
ignoring services named ‘6to4’ and ‘Ias’ as these services have been used by other malware families.
When it finds another netsvcs service with a name not matching these two names, it will delete the file associated with the service and
copy the ‘rastls.dll’ file to that folder using ‘<service name>ve.dll’ as the filename as shown in Figure 9 below.

Figure 10 Renamed ‘rastls.dll’ DLL
The malware will then change the binary path of the service to point to this new filename and copies the “Sycmentec.config” file to the
same folder and the ‘config.dat’ file to the following location:
c:\windows\system\CERTAPL.DLL
The NetTraveler payload relies on the ‘rastls.dll’ file to obtain its C2 server. At first glance, the NetTraveler payload appears as if it will
use the following URL for its C2 server:
http://192.168.3[.]201/downloader2013/asp/downloader.asp
However, the NetTraveler payload reads the last ‘0xb0’ bytes from the rastls.dll file and uses it to create the “config.dat” file that is later
saved to “CERTAPL.DLL”. This technique hides the true C2 server from researchers that do not have access to both the rastls.dll and
Sycmentec.config files.

Figure 11 Code snippet showing NetTraveler obtaining its configuration from rastls.dll.
The configuration file is structured as an “.ini” file as the Trojan uses GetPrivateProfileStringA to parse the contents. The configuration
file has the following contents:
1 [OOOOOO]
2 U00P=r^?<80>}H>?<88><89><8A>B<8B><85>|<86><87><89><91><8B><90><92><88>N<84><91><90>S<94><96><9B><
3 K00P=XLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghiv
4 P00D=5
5 F00G=True
6 MM1=0
7 MM6=1
Unit 42 analyzed the sample and found the following configuration fields that could appear in the CERTAPL.DLL configuration file and a
brief description of each field:
1 U00P = C2 URL
2 K00P = Key for DES
3 P00D = Sleep interval in minutes
4 F00G = Boolean to determine if sample should use proxy to communicate with C2 server
5 MM1 = 0 or 1 if proxy is configured or not.
6 MM3 = Port for configured proxy
7 MM4 = Username for configured proxy
8 MM5 = Password for configured proxy
9 MM6 = 1 if Trojan is installed correctly
The “U00P” and “K00P” values are decrypted using a simple algorithm that subtracts the index and then subtracts ten from each
character, which is depicted in the following:
1 def subtraction_algo(ct):
2
out = ""
3
i=0
4
for e in ct:
5
out += chr(ord(e)-i-10)
6
i += 1
7
return out

These two fields decrypt to the following, the U00P value being the C2 URL and the K00P value being the basis for an encryption key
for the DES algorithm:
U00P: http://www.voennovosti.com/optdet/index.asp (decrypted)
K00P: NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM (decrypted)
The C2 server will respond to requests issued by the Trojan with commands to carry out activities on the compromised system. We
analyzed the code within NetTraveler that handles commands issued by the C2 server and found four available commands that are
listed in Table 2.
Command
Description
<Unique System ID>:UNINSTALL
Deletes
%APPDATA%\cert2013.dat and
%STARTUP%\consent.lnk and
exits the process. This attempts to
uninstall the Trojan, but will not
work as the filenames are not
used by this version of NetTraveler
<Unique System ID>:RUN_REBOOT Reboots the system
<Unique System
Downloads a file to
ID>:RUN_STARTUP
%TEMP%\Temp.bmp and copies it
to the startup folder
<Unique System ID>:RUN_DIRECT Download a file to
%TEMP%\tmp.bmp and execute it
Table 2 Commands available within NetTraveler and a description of their functionality

INFRASTRUCTURE
At the time of analysis, the domain voennovosti[.]com was resolving to IP ‘98.126.38[.]107’, which is hosted by Krypt Technologies. A
report published by Kaspersky Labs in 2011 on NetTraveler also mentions the C2 servers were being hosted by Krypt Technolgies.
This web hosting service provider continues to be the hosting provider of choice for the threat actors behind NetTraveler.

Figure 12 DNS query for voennovosti[.]com resolves to ‘98.126.38.107’

CONCLUSION
NetTraveler has been used to target diplomats, embassies and government institutions for over a decade, and remains the tool of
choice by the adversaries behind these cyber espionage campaigns. The use of NetTraveler for such a long period of time shows its
effectiveness and success by the adversaries in targeting their victims with impunity.

As seen in this case, the threat actors continue to evolve and employ new techniques within their modus operandi, like ‘DLL side­
loading’ to install malware. It is likely that the use of ‘DLL side loading’ attack technique will increase due to it’s effectiveness to bypass
traditional security systems.
It is essential to raise awareness on such attacks to better protect organizations from adversaries who maybe backed by nation states.
WildFire correctly classifies NetTraveler as malicious. AutoFocus tags are created to identify NetTraveler samples and respective IOCs
are added to Palo Alto Networks Threat Prevention.
