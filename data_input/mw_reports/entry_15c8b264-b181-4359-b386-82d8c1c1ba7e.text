A couple of tidbits
Before we formally introduce you to the 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR),
let us get some clarifications out of the way first to reduce potential ambiguity around terms,
labels, and figures that you will find throughout this study.

VERIS resources

Industry labels

The terms “threat actions,” “threat actors,” “varieties,” and “vectors”
will be referenced a lot. These are part of the Vocabulary for Event
Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS), a framework designed to
allow for a consistent, unequivocal collection of security incident
details. Here are some select definitions followed by links with
more information on the framework and on the enumerations.

We align with the North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS) standard to categorize the victim organizations
in our corpus. The standard uses 2 to 6 digit codes to classify
businesses and organizations. Our analysis is typically done at
the 2-digit level and we will specify NAICS codes along with an
industry label. For example, a chart with a label of Financial (52)
is not indicative of 52 as a value. 52 is the NAICS code for the
Finance and Insurance sector. The overall label of “Financial” is
used for brevity within the figures. Detailed information on the
codes and classification system is available here:

Threat actor:
Who is behind the event? This could be the external “bad guy”
that launches a phishing campaign, or an employee who leaves
sensitive documents in their seat back pocket.
Threat action:
What tactics (actions) were used to affect an asset? VERIS uses
seven primary categories of threat actions: Malware, Hacking,
Social, Misuse, Physical, Error, and Environmental. Examples at a
high level are hacking a server, installing malware, and influencing
human behavior.
Variety:
More specific enumerations of higher level categories - e.g.,
classifying the external “bad guy” as an organized criminal group,
or recording a hacking action as SQL injection or brute force.

Incident vs. breaches
We talk a lot about incidents and breaches and we use the
following definitions:
Incident:
A security event that compromises the integrity, confidentiality
or availability of an information asset.
Breach:
An incident that results in the confirmed disclosure—not just
potential exposure—of data to an unauthorized party.

This year we’re putting it in the bar charts. The black dot is the
value, but the slope gives you an idea of where the real value could
be between. In this sample figure we’ve added a few red bars to
highlight it, but in 19 bars out of 20 (95%),1 the real number will
be between the two red lines on the bar chart. Notice that as the
sample size (n) goes down, the bars get farther apart. If the lower
bound of the range on the top bar overlaps with the higher bound of
the bar beneath it, they are treated as statistically similar and thus
statements that x is more than y will not be proclaimed.

Introduction
“The wound is the place where the light enters you.”
— Rumi
Welcome! Pull up a chair with the 2019 Verizon
Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR).
The statements you will read in the pages that follow
are data-driven, either by the incident corpus that
is the foundation of this publication, or by non-incident
data sets contributed by several security vendors.
This report is built upon analysis of 41,686 security
incidents, of which 2,013 were confirmed data
breaches. We will take a look at how results are
changing (or not) over the years as well as digging
into the overall threat landscape and the actors,
actions, and assets that are present in breaches.
Windows into the most common pairs of threat
actions and affected assets also are provided.
This affords the reader with yet another means to
analyze breaches and to find commonalities above
and beyond the incident classification patterns that
you may already be acquainted with.
Fear not, however. The nine incident classification
patterns are still around, and we continue to focus on
how they correlate to industry. In addition to the nine
primary patterns, we have created a subset of data to
pull out financially-motivated social engineering (FMSE)
attacks that do not have a goal of malware installation.
Instead, they are more focused on credential theft and
duping people into transferring money into adversarycontrolled accounts. In addition to comparing industry
threat profiles to each other, individual industry
sections are once again front and center.
Joining forces with the ever-growing incident/breach
corpus, several areas of research using non-incident
data sets such as malware blocks, results of phishing
training, and vulnerability scanning are also utilized.
Leveraging, and sometimes combining, disparate data
sources (like honeypots and internet scan research)
allows for additional data-driven context.

If you didn’t expect a Stan Lee reference in this report, then you are certainly a first-time reader. Welcome to the party pal!

It is our charge to present information on the common
tactics used by attackers against organizations in
your industry. The purpose of this study is not to
rub salt in the wounds of information security, but to
contribute to the “light” that raises awareness and
provides the ability to learn from the past. Use it as
another arrow in your quiver to win hearts, minds, and
security budget. We often hear that this is “required
reading” and strive to deliver actionable information in
a manner that does not cause drowsiness, fatigue,
or any other adverse side effects.
We continue to be encouraged and energized by
the coordinated data sharing by our 73 data sources,
66 of which are organizations external to Verizon.
This community of data contributors represents an
international group of public and private entities willing
to support this annual publication. We again thank
them for their support, time, and, of course, DATA.
We all have wounds, none of us knows everything,
let’s learn from each other.
Excelsior!

Results and analysis
year the trend continues. There are some subsets
of data that are removed from the general corpus,
notably over 50,000 botnet related breaches. These
would have been attributed to external groups and,
had they been included, would have further increased
the gap between the External and Internal threat.

The results found in this and subsequent sections
within the report are based on a data set collected
from a variety of sources such as publicly-disclosed
security incidents, cases provided by the Verizon
Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC)
investigators, and by our external collaborators. The
year-to-year data set(s) will have new sources of
incident and breach data as we strive to locate and
engage with organizations that are willing to share
information to improve the diversity and coverage
of real-world events. This is a convenience sample,
and changes in contributors, both additions and
those who were not able to participate this year, will
influence the data set. Moreover, potential changes
in their areas of focus can stir the pot o’ breaches
when we trend over time. All of this means we are not
always researching and analyzing the same fish in
the same barrel. Still other potential factors that may
affect these results are changes in how we subset
data and large-scale events that can sometimes
influence metrics for a given year. These are all
taken into consideration, and acknowledged where
necessary, within the text to provide appropriate
context to the reader.

once again provided. A deeper dive into the overall
results for this year’s data set with an old-school
focus on threat action categories follows. Within
the threat action results, relevant non-incident data
is included to add more awareness regarding the
tactics that are in the adversaries’ arsenal.

Threat actor is the terminology used to describe
who was pulling the strings of the breach (or if an
error, tripping on them). Actors are broken out into
three high-level categories of External, Internal, and
Partner. External actors have long been the primary
culprits behind confirmed data breaches and this

Financial gain is still the most common motive behind
data breaches where a motive is known or applicable
(errors are not categorized with any motive). This
continued positioning of personal or financial gain at
the top is not unexpected. In addition to the botnet
breaches that were filtered out, there are other
scalable breach types that allow for opportunistic
criminals to attack and compromise numerous
victims. Breaches with a strategic advantage as the
end goal are well-represented, with one-quarter of
the breaches associated with espionage. The ebb
and flow of the financial and espionage motives are
indicative of changes in the data contributions and
the multi-victim sprees.

This year there was a continued reduction in

environments and card skimming operations.
Similar percentage changes in organized criminal
groups and state-affiliated operations are shown in
Figure 8 above. Another notable finding (since we
are already walking down memory lane) is the bump
in Activists, who were somewhat of a one-hit wonder
in the 2012 DBIR with regard to confirmed data
breaches. We also don’t see much of Cashier (which
also encompasses food servers and bank tellers)
anymore. System administrators are creeping up
and while the rogue admin planting logic bombs and
other mayhem makes for a good story, the presence
of insiders is most often in the form of errors. These
are either by misconfiguring servers to allow for
unwanted access or publishing data to a server that
should not have been accessible by all site viewers.
Please, close those buckets!

Figures 9 and 10 show changes in threat actions and
affected assets from 2013 to 2018. No, we don’t have
some odd affinity for seven-year time frames (as far
as you know). Prior years were heavily influenced by
payment card breaches featuring automated attacks
on POS devices with default credentials, so 2013
was a better representative starting point. The rise in
social engineering is evident in both charts, with the
action category Social and the related human asset
both increasing.

of action varieties associated with security incidents,
but it is still very rare for DoS to feature in a confirmed
data breach. Similarly, Loss, which is short for Lost or
misplaced assets, incidents are not labeled as a data
breach if the asset lost is a laptop or phone, as there
is no feasible way to determine if data was accessed.
We allow ourselves to infer data disclosure if the asset
involved was printed documents.

Threat action varieties
When we delve a bit deeper and examine threat actions
at the variety level, the proverbial question of “What are
the bad guys doing?” starts to become clearer. Figure 11

Note these are incident years, not DBIR years. All of the 2018 will be represented in this year’s data, but a 2012 breach not discovered until 2013 would be part of the 2014 DBIR.

Switching over to breaches in Figure 12, phishing and
the hacking action variety of use of stolen credentials
are prominent fixtures. The next group of three
involves the installation and subsequent use of backdoor or Command and Control (C2) malware. These
tactics have historically been common facets of data
breaches and based on our data, there is still much
success to be had there.

Hacking
A quick glance at the figures below uncovers two
prominent hacking variety and vector combinations.
The more obvious scenario is using a backdoor or
C2 via the backdoor or C2 channel, and the less
obvious, but more interesting, use of stolen
credentials. Utilizing valid credentials to pop web
applications is not exactly avant garde.
The reason it becomes noteworthy is that 60%
of the time, the compromised web application vector
was the front-end to cloud based email servers.

Even though stolen credentials are not directly
associated with patch currency, it is still a necessary
and noble undertaking. At most, six percent of
breaches in our data set this year involved exploiting
vulnerabilities. Remember that time your network
was scanned for vulnerabilities and there were zero
findings? You slept soundly that night only to be
jolted from your drowsy utopia by your alarm radio
blaring “I Got You Babe.” Vulnerability scanning always
yields findings (even benign informational ones) and
it is up to the administrators to determine which are
accepted, and which are addressed.

11

Figure 15 shows the patching behavior of hundreds
of organizations from multiple vulnerability scanning
contributors. Based on scan history, we determine
that organizations will typically have a big push to
remediate findings after they are initially discovered
and after that there is a steady increase in percentage
of findings fixed until it levels out. Not unlike the
amount of romance and mutual regard that occurs
while dating vs. once married. You get the idea.
The area under the curve (AUC) is how protected
you are while you are actively patching. Quick
remediation will result in a higher AUC. The
percentage completed-on-time (COT) is the amount
of vulnerabilities patched at a pre-determined
cut-off time; we used 90 days. Your COT metric
could be different, and it would make sense to have
different COTs for Internet-facing devices or browser
vulnerabilities, and certainly for vulnerabilities with
active exploitation in the wild.
It is important to acknowledge that there will always
be findings. The key is to prioritize the important
ones and have a plan for the remaining actionable
vulnerabilities; and to be able to defend acceptance of
unaddressed findings.

Findings fixed

Malware can be leveraged in numerous ways to
establish or advance attacks. Command and Control
(C2) and backdoors are found in both security
incidents and breaches. Ransomware is still a major
issue for organizations and is not forced to rely on
data theft in order to be lucrative.

We were at a hipster coffee shop and it was packed
with people talking about cryptomining malware as
the next big thing. The numbers in this year’s
data set do not support the hype, however, as this
malware functionality does not even appear in the
top 10 varieties. In previous versions of VERIS,

cryptominers were lumped in with click-fraud, but
they received their own stand-alone enumeration
this year. Combining both the new and legacy
enumerations for this year, the total was 39—more
than zero, but still far fewer than the almost 500

Figure 19. Malware types and delivery methods

Figure 18 displays that when the method of malware
installation was known, email was the most common
point of entry. This finding is supported in Figure 19,
which presents data received from millions of
malware detonations, and illustrates that the median
company received over 90% of their detected
malware by email. Direct install is indicative of a
device that is already compromised and the malware
is installed after access is established. It is possible
for malware to be introduced via email, and once the
foothold is gained, additional malware is downloaded,
encoded to bypass detection and installed directly. Like
most enumerations, these are not mutually exclusive.

Phishing

Pretexting

Bribery

Extortion

Forgery
Social
While hacking and malicious code may be the words
that resonate most with people when the term “data
breach” is used, there are other threat action categories that have been around much longer and are still
ubiquitous. Social engineering, along with Misuse,
Error, and Physical, do not rely on the existence of
“cyberstuff” and are definitely worth discussing. We
will talk about these “OGs” now, beginning with the
manipulation of human behavior.
There is some cause for hope in regard to phishing,
as click rates from the combined results of multiple
security awareness vendors are going down. As you
can see in Figure 21, click rates are at 3%.

Research points to users being significantly
more susceptible to social attacks they
receive on mobile devices. This is the case for
email-based spear phishing, spoofing attacks
that attempt to mimic legitimate webpages, as
well as attacks via social media.
7, 8, 9

The reasons for this stem from the design
of mobile and how users interact with these
devices. In hardware terms, mobile devices
have relatively limited screen sizes that restrict
what can be accessed and viewed clearly.
Most smartphones also limit the ability to
view multiple pages side-by-side, and navigating pages and apps necessitates toggling
between them—all of which make it tedious
for users to check the veracity of emails and
requests while on mobile.
Mobile OS and apps also restrict the
availability of information often necessary
for verifying whether an email or webpage is
fraudulent. For instance, many mobile browsers
limit users’ ability to assess the quality of a
website’s SSL certificate. Likewise, many
mobile email apps also limit what aspects of
the email header are visible and whether the
email-source information is even accessible.

Mobile software also enhances the prominence
of GUI elements that foster action—accept,
reply, send, like, and such­—which make it easier
for users to respond to a request. Thus, on the
one hand, the hardware and software on mobile
devices restrict the quality of information that
is available, while on the other they make it
easier for users to make snap decisions.
The final nail is driven in by how people use
mobile devices. Users often interact with
their mobile devices while walking, talking,
driving, and doing all manner of other activities
that interfere with their ability to pay careful
attention to incoming information. While
already cognitively constrained, on screen
notifications that allow users to respond to
incoming requests, often without even having
to navigate back to the application from which
the request emanates, further enhance the
likelihood of reactively responding to requests.
Thus, the confluence of design and how
users interact with mobile devices make it
easier for users to make snap, often
uninformed decisions—which significantly
increases their susceptibility to social
attacks on mobile devices.

Clicked

With regard to the event chain for these attacks, if the
device on which the communication was read and/or
interacted with does not have malicious code installed
as part of the phish, it may not be recorded as an
affected asset. For example, if a user is tricked into
visiting a phony site and he/she then enters credentials,
the human asset is recorded as well as the asset that
the credentials are used to access. To that end, those
moments when the users thoughts are adrift provide
an excellent opportunity for criminals to phish via SMS
or emails to mobile devices. This is supported by the
18% of clicks from the sanctioned phishing data that
were attributed to mobile. Below is a window into
mobile devices and how the way humans use them can
contribute to successful phishing attacks provided by
researcher Arun Vishwanath, Chief Technologist, Avant
Research Group, LLC.

Misuse
Misuse is the malicious or inappropriate use of
existing privileges. Often it cannot be further defined
beyond that point in this document due to a lack
of granularity provided; this fact is reflected in the
more generic label of Privilege abuse as the

top variety in Figure 22. The motives are
predominantly financial in nature, but employees
taking sensitive data on the way out to provide
themselves with an illegal advantage in their next
endeavor are also common.

Affected assets

As we see in Figure 24, the top two error varieties
are consistent with prior publications, with
Misconfiguration increasing at the expense of Loss
and Disposal Errors. Sending data to the incorrect
recipients (either via email or by mailed documents)
is still an issue. Similarly, exposing data on a public
website (publishing error) or misconfiguring an asset
to allow for unwanted guests also remain prevalent.

Workstations, web applications, and surprisingly,
mail servers are in the top group of assets affected
in data breaches. There is a great deal to be
learned about how threat actions associate with
assets within the event chains of breaches. We
get down to business in Table 1 to pull out some of
the more interesting stories the 2019 DBIR data
has to tell us.

Table 1
Top action and asset variety combinations within breaches, (n= 2,013)

The table above does exclude assets where a
particular variety was not known. In the majority of
phishing breaches, we are not privy to the exact
role of the influenced user and thus, Person Unknown would have been present. We can deduce
that phishing of Those Who Cannot Be Named
leads to malware installed on desktops or tricking
users into providing their credentials.
Most often, those compromised credentials were to
cloud-based mail servers. There was an uptick
in actors seeking these credentials to compromise a
user’s email account. It turns out there are
several ways to leverage this newly found access.
Actors can launch large phishing campaigns from

the account, or if the account owner has a certain
degree of clout, send more targeted and elaborate
emails to employees who are authorized to pay
bogus invoices.
There were also numerous cases where an
organization’s email accounts were compromised
and the adversary inserted themselves into
conversations that centered around payments. At
this point, the actors are appropriately positioned
to add forwarding rules in order to shut out the
real account owner from the conversation. Then
they simply inform the other recipients that
they need to wire money to a different account on
this occasion because…reasons.

Another trend in this year’s data set is a marked shift
away from going after payment cards via ATM/gas
pump skimming or Point of Sale systems and towards
e-commerce applications. The 83 breaches with
the association of web application and the action of
type capture application data is one indicator of this
change. Figure 26 below illustrates how breaches
with compromised payment cards are becoming
increasingly about web servers – additional details
can be found in the Retail industry section.

Compromised data
Figure 27 details the varieties of data that were
disclosed as a result of the data breaches
that occurred this year. Personal information is
once again prevalent. Credentials and Internal
are statistically even, and are often both found in
the same breach. The previously mentioned
credential theft leading to the access of corporate
email is a very common example.

discovered much more quickly because it is relatively
obvious when someone has broken the glass out of
your car door and taken your computer.

As we have mentioned in previous reports, when
breaches are successful, the time to compromise
is typically quite short. Obviously, we have no way
of knowing how many resources were expended
in activities such as intelligence gathering and
other preparations. However, the time from the
attacker’s first action in an event chain to the initial
compromise of an asset is typically measured in
minutes. Conversely, the time to discovery is more
likely to be months. Discovery time is very dependent
on the type of attack in question. With payment card
compromises, for instance, discovery is usually based
upon the fraudulent use of the stolen data (typically
weeks or months), while a stolen laptop will usually be

Finally, it goes without saying that not being
compromised in the first place is the most desirable
scenario in which to find oneself. Therefore, a focus
on understanding what data types you possess
that are likely to be targeted, along with the correct
application of controls to make that data more difficult
(even with an initial device compromise) to access and
exfiltrate is vital. Unfortunately, we do not have a lot
of data around time to exfiltration, but improvements
within your own organization in relation to both that
metric along with time to discovery can result in the
prevention of a high-impact confirmed data breach.

Unbroken chains
While it is our belief that this section can be of interest and benefit to our readers, there are a couple
of caveats that should be made clear from the beginning. First of all, we have only recently updated
the VERIS schema to allow for collection of event chain data. Secondly, not all incident and breach
records offer enough details to attempt to map out the path traveled by the threat actor.
We collect an action, actor, asset, and attribute at each step. However, each may be “Unknown” or
omitted completely if it did not occur in that particular step of the attack. To create a single path from
these factors, we begin by placing the actor at the first step at the beginning of the path. It’s followed
by the action and then attribute present in the step. For the remaining steps it proceeds from action
to attribute to action of the next step, simply skipping over any omitted.

This calls for the old Billy Baroo.
Last year we pointed out how a golfer navigating a golf
course is a lot like an adversary attacking your network.
The course creator builds sand traps and water
hazards along the way to make life difficult. Additional
steps, such as the length of grass in the rough and
even the pin placement on the green can raise the
stroke average for a given hole. In our world, you’ve put
defenses and mitigations in place to deter, detect, and
defend. And just like on the golf course, the attackers
reach into their bag, pull out their iron, in the form of
a threat action, and do everything they can to land on
the attribute they want in the soft grass of the fairway.

11

absolutely have to? Just place your ball right there on
the green and tap it in for a birdie or a double eagle,
as the case may be. And while your normal genteel
golfer will abide (to a greater or lesser degree) by the
course rules on the off chance that there is a Marshall
watching and start on hole 1, threat actors will invariably take the shotgun start approach. They will begin
their round on the hole they are shooting for, whether
it’s confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

“My golf security is so delicate, so
tenuously wired together with silent
inward prayers, exhortations and unstable
visualizations, that the sheer pressure
of an additional pair of eyes crumbles the
whole rickety structure into rubble.”
—John Updike, with the sympathy of some CISOs.

The first thing to know is that unlike a golfer who
graciously paces all the way back to the tees to take
his or her first shot, your attackers won’t be anywhere
near as courteous. In Figure 29 we see that attack
paths are much more likely to be short than long. And
why not, if you’re not following the rules (and which
attackers do?) why hit from the tees unless you

to point a few things out.

We are not saying hackers have early 90’s John Daly mullets. We don’t have data to support that. We just imagine that they do, and that this is why they all wear hoodies in clip art.

First, starting with Confidentiality, take a look at just
how many short paths result from Misuse and Error,
and to a lesser extent from Physical actions. On the
other hand, we can see Hacking actions bounding
back and forth between attributes for several steps.
In Integrity we see an especially long chain beginning
with Hacking and going to and fro between that and

12

Malware as it compromises the Confidentiality and
Integrity of the target.
Obviously, there’s a lot going on in Figure 30. An
easier way of looking at it is what actions start
(Figure 31), continue (Figure 32), and end (Figure 33)
incidents.

There’s a lot going on in this figure. Take your time and explore it. For example, notice the differences between short and long attacks.

22

We see that the while Hacking
is a little farther ahead, the
first action in an incident could
be almost anything. The most
interesting part is that Malware
is at the end of the chart, even
behind Physical, which requires
the attacker to be, well, physically
present during the attack.
Malware is usually not the
driver you use to get off the tee;
remember that most is delivered
via social or hacking actions.
Hacking

Moving on to Figure 32, Malware
makes its grand entrance. It
may not be the opening shot, but
it is the trusty 7-iron (or 3 wood,
pick your analogy according to
your skills), that is your go-to club
for those middle action shots.
Interestingly, there are almost
no Misuse and Physical middle
actions and no Error in our data
set. That’s primarily because
these are short attack paths
and to be in the middle you have
to have at least three events in
the chain.

And finally, we get a chance
to see where attacks end in
Figure 33. The most significant
part is how Social is now at the
bottom. While social attacks
are significant for starting and
continuing attacks as seen in
Figures 31, they’re rarely the
three-foot putt followed by
the tip of the visor to the
sunburned gallery.

At this point, you may be wondering if your sand traps
are sandy enough. Figure 34 comes from breach
simulation data. It shows that in testing, defenders fail
to stop short paths substantially more often than long
paths. So, just in case you were looking on your systems
and thinking “it’s the other guys that let the attackers
start on the putting green,” short attacks work.

Attack Paths and Mitigations
Our friends at the Center for Internet Security
contributed some thoughts on mitigating
attack paths:
Much of security has been founded on catalogues of controls, vague vendor promises,
laborious legislation, and tomes of things to
do to keep your organization safe. Within this
sea of options, we also have to justify our
budgets, staff, and meet the business needs
of the organization. Leveraging an attack path
model is not only an important step towards
formalizing our understanding of attacks, but
also a means to understanding our defense.
Previously, when looking at attack summary
data we were presented with a snapshot of an
attacker’s process which requires us to infer

the preceding and proceeding events. Whether we realize it or not, such interpretations
impact how we plan our defenses. Defending
against malware takes a different approach if
the malware is dropped via social engineering,
a drive-by download, or brought in by an
insider via a USB device.
In addition, while being faced with what seems
like an endless list of potential attacks, limiting
ourselves to snapshots also hinders our ability
to find commonalities between these attacks.
Such commonalities may be key dependencies
in an attacker’s process which represent
opportunities for us to disrupt. The more
we can understand the sequence of events
happening in an attack, the more we as a
community can make it harder for adversaries
to reuse the same process.

24

Incident classification
patterns and subsets
Beginning with the 2014 report, we have utilized
nine basic patterns to categorize security incidents
and data breaches that share several similar
characteristics. This was done in an effort to
communicate that the majority of incidents/breaches,
even targeted, sophisticated attacks, generally
share enough commonalities to categorize them, and
study how often each pattern is found in a particular
industry’s data set. When we first identified the

patterns six years ago we reported that 92 percent
of the incidents in our corpus going back 10 years
could be categorized into one of the nine patterns.
Fast-forwarding to today with over 375,000 incidents
and over 17,000 data breaches, the numbers reveal
that 98.5% of security incidents and 88% of data
breaches continue to find a home within one of the
original nine patterns. So, it would appear that, as with
humans, the “I can change” mantra is false here as well.

The patterns will be referenced more in the
industry sections, but to get acquainted or rekindle
a relationship, they are defined below:

Crimeware:
All instances involving malware that did not fit into a
more specific pattern. The majority of incidents that
comprise this pattern are opportunistic in nature and
are financially motivated.
Notable findings: Command and control (C2) is
the most common functionality (47%) in incidents,
followed by Ransomware (28%).
Cyber-Espionage:
Incidents in this pattern include unauthorized
network or system access linked to state-affiliated
actors and/or exhibiting the motive of espionage.
Notable findings: Threat actors attributed to stateaffiliated groups or nation-states combine to make up
96% of breaches, with former employees, competitors,
and organized criminal groups representing the rest.
Phishing was present in 78% of Cyber-Espionage
incidents and the installation and use of backdoors
and/or C2 malware was found in over 87% of incidents.
Breaches involving internal actors are categorized in
the Insider and Privilege Misuse pattern.
Denial of Service:
Any attack intended to compromise the availability
of networks and systems. This includes both network
and application attacks designed to overwhelm
systems, resulting in performance degradation or
interruption of service.
Notable findings: This pattern is based on the specific
hacking action variety of DoS. The victims in our data
set are large organizations over 99 percent of the time.
Insider and Privilege Misuse:
All incidents tagged with the action category
of Misuse—any unapproved or malicious use of
organizational resources—fall within this pattern.
Notable findings: This is mainly insider misuse, but
former and collusive employees as well as partners
are present in the data set.

Miscellaneous Errors:
Incidents in which unintentional actions directly
compromised a security attribute of an asset.
Notable findings: Misdelivery of sensitive data,
publishing data to unintended audiences, and
misconfigured servers account for 85% of this pattern.
Payment Card Skimmers:
All incidents in which a skimming device was
physically implanted (tampering) on an asset that
reads magnetic stripe data from a payment card.
Notable findings: Physical tampering of ATMs and
gas pumps has decreased from last year. This may
be attributable to EMV and disruption of card-present
fraud capabilities.
Point of Sale Intrusions:
Remote attacks against the environments where
card-present retail transactions are conducted. POS
terminals and POS controllers are the targeted assets.
Physical tampering of PIN entry device (PED) pads or
swapping out devices is covered in the Payment Card
Skimmers section.
Notable findings: The Accommodation industry is still
the most common victim within this pattern, although
breaches were less common this year.
Physical Theft and Loss:
Any incident where an information asset went missing,
whether through misplacement or malice.
Notable findings: The top two assets found in Physical
Theft and Loss breaches are paper documents,
and laptops. When recorded, the most common
location of theft was at the victim work area, or from
employee-owned vehicles.
Web Application Attacks:
Any incident in which a web application was the
vector of attack. This includes exploits of code-level
vulnerabilities in the application as well as thwarting
authentication mechanisms.
Notable findings: Over one-half of breaches in this
pattern are associated with unauthorized access of
cloud-based email servers.

26

Everything Else:
Any incident or breach that was not categorized into
one of the nine aforementioned patterns.
Notable findings: Of the 241 breaches that fell into
the Everything Else pattern, 28% are part of the
Financially-Motivated Social Engineering attacks
subset discussed later in this section.

Patterns within patterns
There are two subsets of incidents that will be called
out when looking at industry breakouts. The increase
in mail server (and email account) compromise and
the significant dollar losses from social attacks leading
to fraudulent payments provided an opportunity to
create a Financially-Motivated Social Engineering
(FMSE) subset that Includes incidents and breaches
that would fall into Web Application Attacks or
Everything Else. These incidents are included in the
main corpus, but we will look at them independently
as well. The incidents that comprise the botnet
subset, are not part of the main data set, due
to the sheer volume. These incidents could fall into
Crimeware if modeled from the perspective of
the malware recipient, or Web applications if the
botnet steals credentials from one victim and is used
against another organizations’ application. Our
data is from the latter, organizations whose systems
are logged on via stolen user credentials.

Financially-Motivated Social Engineering Subset:
Financially motivated incidents that resulted in either
a data breach or fraudulent transaction that featured
a Social action but did not involve malware installation
or employee misuse. Financial pretexting and phishing
attacks (e.g., Business Email Compromise, W-2
phishing) are included in this subset.
Notable findings: 370 incidents, 248 of which are
confirmed data breaches, populate this subset. The
incidents are split almost evenly between parent
patterns of Everything Else and Web applications.
The breaches are closer to a 3:1 Web Application to
Everything Else ratio.

Analysis shows 6x fewer Human Resources personnel
being impacted in breaches this year. This finding, as
correlated with the W-2 scams, almost disappearing
from our dataset. While this may be due to improved
awareness within organizations, our data doesn’t offer
any definitive answers as to what has caused the drop.
Botnet Subset:
Comprised of over 50,000 instances of customers as
victims of banking Trojans or other credential-stealing
malware. These are generally low on details and
analyzed separately to avoid eclipsing the rest of the
main analysis data set.
Notable findings: 84% of the victims were in Finance
and Insurance (52), 10% in Information (51), and 5% in
Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (54).
180 countries and territories are represented in these
breaches. Botnets are truly a low-effort attack that
knows no boundaries and brings attackers either direct
revenue through financial account compromise or
infrastructure to work from.
Secondary Subset:
Comprised of 6,527 incidents of web applications
used for secondary attacks such as DDoS sources or
malware hosting. These are legitimate incidents, but
low on details and analyzed separately from the main
analysis data set.
Notable findings: Many times, these are light on
specifics, but we do know that 39% of the time they
involved a malware action, with 70% of those
being DDoS, and 30% exploiting a vulnerability and
downloading additional malware. Attackers need
infrastructure too and just like with the botnet subset,
when an attacker takes over your web application,
your infrastructure just got converted to multi-tenant.

27

Data breaches: extended version
There’s definitely a feeling in InfoSec that the attackers
are outpacing us. They’ve got all the creds, the
vulns, and the shells, not to mention the possibility
of huge monetary incentives. We, on the other hand,
have a four-year project just to replace the servers
on end-of-life operating systems. However, when
contemplating this unfair advantage it’s sometimes
easy for us to overlook the bigger picture. While it is
true that attacks typically happen quickly (hours or
less) when they are well aimed, and it also is true that
when our organizations are successfully breached
it often takes us months or more to learn of it, there
is still room for optimism. In the paths section we
examined the route that attackers take to get from
point A to point B. In this section we take a look at
those events that take place prior to the attack, and
those required after the attack has ended in order for
the attacker to realize their profit.

“Give me a place to stand and a lever long
enough and I will move the world.”
—Archimedes

Like all good stories, attackers need somewhere to
begin, and whether this starting point is with a list of
vulnerable servers, phished emails, or stolen credentials, if the proverbial lever is long enough they will
breach your perimeter. Therefore, it is wise to do all
that you can to reduce the number of starting points
that they are provided. After all, vulns can usually
be patched and creds can be better protected with
multi-factor authentication. Having said that, we do
realize that even the best security departments can
only do so much. Sixty-two percent of breaches not
involving an Error, Misuse, or Physical action (in other
words, wounds that weren’t self-inflicted) involved
the use of stolen creds, brute force, or phishing.
And all that malware doesn’t write itself. Admittedly,
there’s not a lot you can do about the development,
preparation, targeting, distribution, and other
shenanigans that take place on the part of the bad
guy before the breach. However, what goes down
after the breach is another story altogether.

Save some large organizations that have gone after dark markets or bullet-proof hosting

Just ask the axis
Let’s look at what’s being stolen. In Figure 37
we illustrate the analysis of the amount lost to
attackers in two types of breaches: business email
compromises and computer data breaches. This
loss impact data comes courtesy of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint
Center (FBI IC3) who have offered some helpful
hints in the breakout at the end of this section.
When looking at the visualized distribution, the first
thing to notice is the spike at zero. Not all incidents
and breaches result in a loss. The second piece of
good news is that the median loss for a business email
compromise is approximately the same as the average
cost of a used car. The bad news is that the dollar
axis isn’t linear. There are about as many breaches
resulting in the loss of between zero and the median
as there are between the median and $100 million. We
are no longer talking about used-car money at this
point, unless you happen to be Jay Leno.
As mentioned above, there’s a great deal that has to
occur even after the breach takes place to make it
worth the criminal’s while. For example, business email
compromises normally involve the fraudulent transfer
of funds into an attacker-owned bank account.

On this front, we have more glad tidings to impart.
When the IC3 Recovery Asset Team acts upon
BECs, and works with the destination bank, half of
all US-based business email compromises had 99%
of the money recovered or frozen; and only 9% had
nothing recovered. Let that sink in. BECs do not pay
out as well as it initially appears, and just because
the attacker won the first round doesn’t mean you
shouldn’t keep fighting.
On the other hand, BECs are still advantageous for
the criminal element because they provide a quick
way to cash out. Many other types of data breaches
require a little more work on the adversaries’ part to
convert stolen data into accessible wealth. A common
solution is to sell what you stole, whether PII, email
addresses, creds, credit card numbers, or access to
resources you have compromised. Figure 38 provides
information about the numerous things for sale in
the darker corners of the Internet (which surprisingly
enough, resemble a 1990s video game message
board). In the center we see a large blue cluster.
This is comprised primarily of credit card related
posts—the buying and selling of credit cards, to make
money, to take money, and to cash out gains. It also
includes smaller nodes related to the attacks involved
in actually stealing the cards. There’s an even smaller
cluster in the upper right which is related to credential
theft. These may grant access to more lucrative
things such as bank accounts, but many times are for
consumer services including video games, streaming
video, etc., that attackers use directly.

The alternative to posting this data for sale on the
dark web is using the data to steal identities and
committing direct fraud themselves. Herein lies the
appeal of stealing tax and health-related information.
Filing fraudulent tax returns or insurance claims is
a relatively straightforward way to put cash in one’s
pocket. The problem is that tax returns and insurance claims don’t pay out in unmarked bills or wire
transfers to South America. This requires another
step in the post-breach to-do list: money laundering.
Normally money laundering is an expensive and
risky task. If, for example, the money has to go
through three separate set of hands on its way to
its final destination, each person needs to take their
respective cut. If the third person in the succession
says they did not receive it, but the first person
insists they sent it, who does the actor believe?
“There is no honor among thieves,” etc.
This is in large part why attackers often favor
cryptocurrency, as is it can be laundered
and transferred for relatively low cost and presents
negligible risk. However, a distinct drawback is
that this type of currency is a bit limited with regard
to what one can purchase with it. Thus, at some
point it has to be exchanged. For these and other
reasons, research into increasing both the risk
and cost associated with cryptocurrency laundering
and/or exchange for illicit purposes has a good
deal of potential as a means of increasing breach
overhead and thereby decreasing the relative
profit associated with such crimes.

About the IC3
The Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet
Crime Complaint Center (IC3) provides the
public with a trustworthy and convenient reporting mechanism to submit information concerning
suspected internet-facilitated criminal activity.
The IC3 defines the Business Email
Compromise (BEC) as a sophisticated scam
targeting both business and individuals performing wire transfer payments.

The Recovery Asset Team (RAT) is an IC3
initiative to assist in the identification
and freezing of fraudulent funds related to
BEC incidents.
Regardless of dollar loss, victims are
encouraged and often directed by law enforcement to file a complaint online at www.ic3.gov.
The IC3 RAT may be able to assist in the
recovery efforts.

Table 2
Number of security incidents by victim industry and organization size

The data set for this report totals over 100,000
incidents, 101,168 to be exact. After we removed the
subsets that were detailed in the prior section, and
applied minimum complexity filters, the data set used
for core analysis is established. Table 2 is the representation of that data set broken out by industry and

organization size, when known. Our annual statement
on what not to do with this breakout will now follow.
Do not utilize this to judge one industry over another –
so a security staffer from a construction organization
waving this in the face of their peer from the financial
sector and trash-talking is a big no-no.

Our community of contributors, disclosure
requirements, and the population sizes for the
industries all play a major part in the numbers
above. The actual threat landscapes for organizations
are better depicted in Figure 39. This shows what
types of attack patterns are more common to
your industry, along with breakouts for threat action
categories and affected assets. We will explore
deeper into the breach jungle, machete in hand, in
the individual industry sections.

As we break down industries we see, for example,
in Figure 40 how FMSE incidents disproportionately
affect Professional Services, Healthcare and Finance,
with more point of sale-centric industries appear
towards the bottom of the list. However, it’s clear
that FMSE incidents affect all industries and so all
organizations need to be trained and prepared to
prevent them.
Phishing
Figure 41 ranks the click rates per industry for
sanctioned security awareness training exercises. This
data was provided by several vendors in this space,
and merged together for analysis. While we realize
we were relatively strict earlier about curtailing trash
talk on the above Table, feel free to use this for some
good-natured banter on an as-needed basis. Just be
sure to keep it at an appropriate level. “Not looking
so hot anymore for someone who works outside,
Construction” is approximately the correct amount of
snark (trust us, we are experts). On a positive note, all
industries are clocking in with percentages that are
less than the overall percentage in this study 2 years
ago. So, this calls for much rejoicing.

Denial of Service

What’s your vector, Victor?

Over time DDoS attacks have been getting much
more tightly clumped with regard to size (similar to
Manufacturing in Figure 42). However, as other
industries illustrate, that is not always the case. Some
industries, Information for instance, experience
attacks across a much wider range. Another important
takeaway is that the median DDoS doesn’t change
much from industry to industry. The difference
between the biggest and smallest industry median is
800Mbps and 400Kpps.

Figure 43 takes a look at the median percentage of
malware vectors and file types per industry; in
other words, it helps you know where to look for the
malware that’s coming in to your organization and
what it will most likely look like. First of all, the majority
of initial malware is delivered by email. Secondary
infections are downloaded by the initial malware, or
directly installed and, as such, are more difficult
for network tools to spot. Secondly, though it varies
a bit by industry, Office documents and Windows
applications are the most common vehicles for the
malware along with “Other” (archives, PDFs, DLLs,
links, and Flash/iOS/Apple/Linux/Android apps).

How can we be of service?
The Accommodation industry prides itself on
hospitality, and over the years it has been far too
hospitable to criminals. Financially motivated actors
are bringing home the bacon by compromising the
Point of Sale (POS) environments and collecting
customers’ payment card data. Table 3 lists the 10
most common combinations of threat action varieties
and assets. These are pairings that are found in the
same breach, but not necessarily the same event or
step in the breach.
As stated above, some of these combinations are
indicative of a specific action taken against a specific
asset (e.g., RAM Scraping malware infecting a

POS Terminal). Others show that some actions are
conducted earlier or later in event chains that feature
a particular asset – you don’t phish a laptop, but
you may phish a human and install malware on his/her
laptop in the next step. In brief, the game has
not changed for this industry. POS Controllers are
compromised and malware specifically designed
to capture payment card data in memory is installed
and extended to connected POS Terminals. While
these POS intrusions are often a small business issue,
large hotel and restaurant chains can learn from
this data and if they use a franchise business model,
disseminate this knowledge to their franchisees.
The RAM scrapers may be the specialty of the
house, but malware does not spontaneously appear
on systems. When the infection vector is known,
it is typically a direct installation after the actors
use stolen, guessable, or default credentials to gain
access into the POS environment.
A cause for optimism?
While attacks against POS environments make up the
vast majority of incidents against Accommodation and
Food Service organizations, the number has decreased
from 307 in last year’s report to 40 in this report.
Sounds pretty dope so far, but we do not use number
of breaches as a solid indicator of “better”
or “worse” as there are not only changes in our
contributors, but also changes in the types of events
our contributors may focus on year over year. Even
with such a drastic change, it isn’t unprecedented.
Figure 44 shows the volatility of breach counts of this
ilk. POS breaches are often conducted by organized
criminal groups looking to breach numerous targets
and there have been sprees of hundreds of victims
associated with the same hacking group. Back in 2011,
default credentials were used with great success
evidenced by over 400 breaches, and recent sprees
have been associated with POS vendors suffering
breaches leading to subsequent breaches
of their customer base.

Figure 44. POS intrusions in Accommodation
breaches over time

The absence of a large spree in this year’s data set
is reflected in the drop, but (and it seems like there is
always a “but”) after our window for data closed and
during this writing there has already been a publicly
disclosed POS vendor breach affecting multiple food
service victims. So, let this be the first ever sneak
peek into the 2020 DBIR – POS attacks are not quite
an endangered species.

Accommodation data breach victims are informed
of their plight the majority of the time via Common
Point of Purchase alerts as shown in Figure 45. In
fact, 100 percent of POS intrusions in this industry
were discovered via external methods. This is a
clear indicator that while there is work to be done
on preventative controls around POS compromise,
there is equal room for improvement in detecting
compromise. Being a realist and understanding that
many of these victims are “mom and pop” operations
asking for sophisticated file integrity software or
DLP is not a feasible plan of action for many of these
organizations. Working with POS vendors to ensure
that someone knows when the environment is
accessed via existing remote access methods is a
start. A pragmatic process to inform the business
owners that legitimate work is being done by the
partner would certainly be another simple step up
from the current state of affairs.

Things to consider:
No vacancy
The numbers from annual breach totals
are influenced by smaller food service
businesses caught up in what we have
described as POS smash-and-grabs.
Whether leveraging default credentials
or stolen credentials, organized criminal
groups often go after numerous little
fish – but not always. Several international hotel chains and restaurants have
also been hit. While the initial intrusion
method may not have been as easy as
scanning the Internet and issuing a default password, there are some lessons
to be learned. Static authentication is
circumvented using valid credentials
and what follows is installation of RAM
scraping malware and adminware such
as psexec or PowerShell to facilitate
the spread of malware across multiple
terminals in multiple locations.

Cover your assets
The data shows year-over-year that
there is a malware problem affecting
POS controllers and terminals. Implement
anti-malware defenses across these
environments and validate (and re–validate) the breadth of implementation and
currency of controls. Focus on detective
controls as well, the external correlation
of fraudulent usage of payment cards
should not be the sole means of finding
out that malware has been introduced
into your POS environment. Restrict
remote access to POS servers and
balance the business needs of interconnectivity between POS systems among
your locations with defending against
the potential spread of malware from
the initial location compromised.
Sleep with one eye open
Since you can’t build a perfectly secure
system, security operations helps
monitor for those weird logins in the
middle of the night. If you can justify it
in your budget, a security operations
team is a must. Even if you can’t
afford an in-house team, contracting it
as a service or requiring it to be a part
of your POS or IT contracts will
cover you and allow you to benefit from
economies of scale.
Chips and Dip
When a chip-enabled card is dipped in a
properly configured EMV-enabled POS
terminal, the static, reusable magnetic
strip information (PAN) is not exposed
or stored. This is a good thing and along
with contactless payment methods,
disrupts the old way of stealing things
for the bad guys. The attacks against
EMV technology are more theoretical
and/or not conducive to real-world use.
We know that cyber-criminals are a
crafty bunch and nothing is bulletproof,
but continue to embrace and implement
new technologies that raise the bar to
protect against payment card fraud.

Figure 46. Patterns within Education breaches (n=99)

It’s in the syllabus
Anticipating the top pattern for Education each year
is a bit like playing the “which shell is it under?” game.
You know it’s (most likely) under one of three shells,
but when you finally point to one, the data proves you
wrong with a deft statistical sleight of hand. There
were three patterns in a statistical dead heat and like
the Netherlands’ women speed skaters in the 3000m,
it was a dominant podium sweep. Miscellaneous
Errors (35%) had a strong showing, because (spoiler
alert) people still have their moments. Most of these
errors are of the typical misdelivery and publishing
error types that we have all come to know and love.

Web Application Attacks accounted for roughly one
quarter of breaches in the Education vertical.
This is mostly due to the frequent compromise of
cloud-based mail services via phishing links to
phony login pages. So, if you use such a service
24/7/...365 you might want to consider tightening
up your password security and implement a second
authentication factor and then turning off IMAP.

39

Everything Else, as previously stated, is more or
less the pattern equivalent of a “lost and found” bin.
It contains numerous incident types we frequently
encounter but that do not provide enough granularity
for us to place in one of the other patterns. For example, there are compromised mail servers, but it was
undetermined if stolen web credentials were the point
of entry. About half or more of these breaches could
be attributed to social engineering attacks via phishing.

There was a smattering of state-affiliated or cyberespionage cases in this year’s data set, a reduction
from the 2017 report as shown in Figure 49. This
finding should not convince our readers that attacks
seeking research findings and other espionage-related
goals have gone the way of Home Economics in this
vertical, but is instead more related to the number and

Things to consider:
Clean out your lockers
Many of the breaches that are represented in this industry are a result of
poor security hygiene and a lack of
attention to detail. Clean up human
error to the best extent possible – then
establish a baseline level of security
around internet-facing assets like web
servers. And in 2019, 2FA on those
servers is baseline security.
Varsity or JV?
Universities that partner with private
Silicon Valley companies, run policy
institutes or research centers are
probably more likely to be a target
of cyber-espionage than secondary
school districts. Understand what
data you have and the type of
adversary who historically seeks it.
Your institution of learning may not be
researching bleeding-edge tech, but
you have PII on students and faculty at
the very least.
Security conformity
There are threats that (no matter how
individualized one may feel) everyone
still has to contend with. Phishing and
general email security, Ransomware,
and DoS are all potential issues
that should be threat modeled and
addressed. These topics may not
seem new, but we still have not
learned our lesson.

Financial and
Insurance
Denial of Service and use of stolen credentials
on banking applications remain common.
Compromised email accounts become evident
once those attacked are filtered. ATM Skimming
continues to decline.

Filters are not just for social media photos
We use filters in data analysis to focus on particular
industries or threat actors and to pull out interesting
topics to discuss. We also exclude certain subsets of
data in order to reduce skew and avoid overlooking other
trends and findings. This is not to say that we ignore
or deny their existence, but rather we analyze them

independently in other sections of this study. In this
industry, we acknowledge, but filter, customer
credential theft via banking Trojan botnets. Their
numbers in this year’s data set show that they are
not inconsequential matters, over 40,000 breaches
associated with botnets were separately analyzed
for the financial sector. We discuss both of these
scenarios in more depth in the Results and Analysis
section, but there is not much to say that has not
already been said on the subjects. Below is what’s left
and we will start with the common pairings of action
and asset varieties.
Keep in mind that breaches are often more than
one event, and sometimes more than one of the
combinations above are found in the same breach.
I’d rather be phishing
When we look at the two pairings that share mail
servers as an affected asset in Table 4, we can see
a story developing. Adversaries are utilizing social
engineering tactics on users and tricking them into
providing their web-based email credentials. That is
followed by the use of those stolen creds to access
the mail account. There are also breaches where the
method of mail server compromise was not known,
but the account was known to have been used to
send phishing emails to colleagues. So, while the
specific action of phishing is directed at a human (as,
by definition, social attacks are), it often precedes or
follows a mail server compromise. And there is no law
that states that phishing cannot both precede and
follow the access into the mail account (there are laws
against phishing, however). Phishing is also a great way
to deliver malicious payloads.

Physical attacks against ATMs have seen a decline

that the progress made in the implementation of EMV
chips in debit cards, influenced by the liability shift
to ATM owners, is one reason for this decline. ATM
jackpotting is certainly an interesting way to make a
buck, but is not a widespread phenomenon. Figure 50

While payment card breaches are declining, personal

(Miscellaneous Errors), Web Applications and
Privilege Misuse are behind over 85 percent.

Things to consider:
Do your part
2FA everything. Use strong
authentication on your customerfacing applications, any remote
access, and any cloud-based email.
Contrarians will be quick to point out
examples of second authentication
factors being compromised,
but that does not excuse a lack of
implementation.
Squish the phish
There is little that financial
organizations can do to ensure that
their customers are running up-todate malware defenses or make them
“phish-proof,” but spreading a little
security awareness their way can’t hurt.
And speaking of security awareness,
leverage it to keep employees on their
toes when interacting with emails.
Inside job
There were 45 confirmed breaches
associated with misuse of privileges.
The details were light on most of
these but tried and true controls are
still relevant. Monitor and log access
to sensitive financial data (which we
think you are already), and make it
quite clear to staff that it is being
done and just how good you are at
recognizing fraudulent transactions.
In other words, “Misuse doesn’t pay.”

The doctor can’t see you now
(that you work for them)
Most people do not enjoy going to the hospital, but
once it becomes unavoidable we all need to believe
fervently that the good women and men who are
providing us care are just this side of perfect. Spoiler
alert: they are not. Healthcare is not only fast paced
and stressful, it is also a heavily-regulated industry.
Those who work in this vertical need to do things
right, do things fast, and remain in compliance with
legislation such as HIPAA and HITECH (in the US).
That in itself is a pretty tall order, but when one
combines that with the fact that the most common
threat actors in this industry are internal to the
organization, it can paint a rather challenging picture.

With internal actors, the main problem is that they
have already been granted access to your systems
in order to do their jobs. One of the top pairings in
Table 5 between actions and assets for Healthcare
was privilege abuse (by internal actors) against
databases. Effectively monitoring and flagging
unusual and/or inappropriate access to data that is
not necessary for valid business use or required
for patient care is a matter of real concern for this
vertical. Across all industries, internal actor breaches
have been more difficult to detect, more often taking
years to detect than do those breaches involving
external actors.
Mailing it in
The Healthcare industry has a multifaceted problem
with mail, in both electronic and printed form. The
industry is not immune to the same illnesses we see
in other verticals such as the very common scenario
of phishing emails sent to dupe users into clicking and
entering their email credentials on a phony site. The
freshly stolen login information is then used to access
the user’s cloud-based mail account, and any patient
data that is chilling in the Inbox, or Sent Items, or other
folder for that matter is considered compromised – and
its disclosure time.
Misdelivery, sending data to the wrong recipient, is
another common threat action variety that plagues
the Healthcare industry. It is the most common error
type that leads to data breaches as shown in Figure 51.
As seen in Table 5 on the next page, documents are
a commonly compromised asset. This could be due
to errors in mailing paperwork to the patient’s home
address or by issuance of discharge papers or other
medical records to the wrong recipient.
Ransomware “breaches”
Most ransomware incidents are not defined as
breaches in this study due to their lack of the
required confirmation of data loss. Unfortunately
for them, Healthcare organizations are required to
disclose ransomware attacks as though they

45

were confirmed breaches due to U.S. regulatory
requirements. This compulsory action will influence the
number of ransomware incidents associated with the
Healthcare sector. Acknowledging the bias, this is the
second straight year that ransomware incidents were
over 70 percent of all malware outbreaks in this vertical.

Things to consider:
Easy access
Know where your major data stores are,
limit necessary access, and track all
access attempts. Start with monitoring
the users who have a lot of access that
might not be necessary to perform their
jobs, and make a goal of finding any
unnecessary lookups.

Misdelivery

Publishing error

Snitches don’t get stitches
Work on improving phishing reporting to
more quickly respond to early clickers
and prevent late clickers. Think about
reward-based motivation if you can—you
catch more flies with honey. And you can
catch phish with flies. Coincidence?

Disposal error

Loss

Perfectly imperfect
Know which processes deliver, publish
or dispose of personal or medical
information and ensure they include
checks so that one mistake doesn’t
equate to one breach.

The Information industry is a veritable pantechnicon
(look it up) that is chock-full of organizations that
have to do with the creation, transmission and
storing of information. One might think that with so
wide an array of victims, the attacks would be all
over the place, but, in fact, it is our duty to inform
you that much of what we saw in this category
for the 2019 report mirrors last year’s results. As
was the case in 2018, most of the incidents in this
industry consists of DoS attacks (63%). In fact, it
is perhaps fitting that this industry covers both TV
and motion pictures, since it is in many ways a rerun
of last year’s programming when viewed from an
incident point of view.

Faulty towers

It’s not only Charlotte’s Web (apps) you can read about

No one is perfect, but when you are a system administrator you are often provided with a better stage on which
to showcase that imperfection. Figure 52 illustrates how
errors are put in the spotlight. Our data indicates that
misconfiguration (45%) and publishing errors (24%) are
common miscues that allowed data disclosure to occur.
When looking at the relationship between actions and
assets in Table 6, 36% (24 of 67) of error-related breaches involved misconfigurations on databases, often cloud
storage – not good. Obviously, those buckets of data
are meant to store lots of information and if your bucket
has a (figurative) hole in it, then it may run completely
dry before you make it back home from the well and
notice. Often these servers are brought online in haste
and configured to be open to the public, while storing
non-public data. Publishing errors on web applications
offer a similar exposure of data to a much wider than
intended audience. Just for cmd shift and giggles, we
will mention that programming errors were committed
on web servers and a couple of databases.

Even if your IT department doesn’t make big mistakes
like the poor unfortunate souls above, there is no need
to worry. You still have more excellent chances to get
your data stolen. Criminals do love a tempting freshly
baked (or half-baked) web application to attack. The illicit
use (and reuse) of stolen creds is a common hacking
action against web applications regardless of industry.
The malware action variety of capture app data is more
commonly associated with e-retailers, the application
data being captured is the user inputting payment
information. While not as common, any internet portals
or membership sites that sell content as opposed to a
physical product would fall into the Information sector.
And payment cards used to purchase content are just as
good to steal as ones used to buy shoes online.

48

I spy with my little eye, something phished
The third pattern in Information breaches we
highlight is Cyber-Espionage. An eye opening
36 percent of external attackers were of the stateaffiliated variety, statistically even with organized
crime. As we have pointed out many times in the
past, most Cyber-Espionage attacks begin with a
successful phishing campaign and that goes some

way to explain why 84 percent of social attacks in
this industry featured phishing emails.
Sir Francis Bacon once famously stated “knowledge
is power.” Perhaps a better definition for 2019 would
be “to gain and to control information is power.”
Therefore, we should probably not be shocked
that the organizations that own and distribute that
information are the target of such attacks.

Things to consider:
Asset assistance
Whether intentional web attacks or erroneous
actions, both databases and web application
servers are oft-compromised assets,
especially for this industry. Many will complain
about”‘checklist security” but a standard
protocol regarding bringing up cloud servers
and publishing sensitive data on websites – if
implemented and followed – would go a long
way to mitigate human error/carelessness.
Scrubbing packets
While breaches were at the forefront of this
section, DDoS protection is an essential control
for Information entities given the percentage

of Denial of Service incidents. Guard against
non-malicious interruptions with continuous
monitoring and capacity planning for traffic
spikes.
It bears repeating
Knowledge is power, and the increase in
state-affiliated attacks is a data point we will
keep an eye on. It could very well be a spike
and not indicative of a trend, but Information
organizations have desirable data and these
motivations would not be likely to disappear in
a year. Understand that these attacks are often
“phishy” in nature and start with a compromised
workstation and escalate from there.

Manufacturing

increase in financially motivated breaches in the
past couple of years, but espionage is still a

Ethan Hunt have finally routed their respective
nemeses for good? Are we free to buy the world
a Coke and teach it to sing in perfect harmony?
Probably not. A more likely explanation is that some
of our partners who typically provide data around
cyber-espionage were either unable to participate
this year or simply happened to work other types of
investigations. This may have contributed to a bias
on those results, meaning the real percentage of
cyber-espionage cases was higher in the wild. If the
relative percentage of one type of case goes down,
the result is an apparent upswing in the other.

For the second year in a row, financially motivated
attacks outnumber cyber-espionage as the main
reason for breaches in Manufacturing, and this year
by a more significant percentage (40% difference).
If this were in most any other vertical, it would not
be worth mentioning as money is the reason for the
vast majority of attacks. However, Manufacturing
has experienced a higher level of espionage-related
breaches than other verticals in the past few years.

Secrets and truths
The Cyber-Espionage pattern, while not as prominent
as in past reports, is still an attack type that we
recommend the Manufacturing industry defend
against. The typical utilization of phishing attacks to
convince users to install remote access tools that
establish footholds and begin the journey towards
stealing important competitive information from
victims remains the same.
In keeping with the aforementioned rise in financially
motivated attacks, the primary perpetrator when
known is organized crime. With regard to data variety,
there is a group of four data types that feature
prominently in this industry. Credentials (49%) and
Internal data (41%), stem from the webmail attacks – if
a more specific data type is not known, Internal is
used for compromised organizational emails. Secrets
(36%) drop from previous heights commensurate to
the reduction in espionage as a motive. The fourth
amigo is Personal information (25%), a data type
that includes employee’s W-2 information and other
nuggets that can be used for identity theft.

Things to consider:
Multiple factors work better
than one
It is a good idea to deploy multiple
factor authentication throughout all
systems that support it, and discourage
password reuse. These actions
will definitely help mitigate the impact
of stolen credentials across the
organization.
Recycling also applies for security
Regardless of motivation, a large
number of breaches in this sector
started with phishing or pretexting
attacks. Providing employees with
frequent security training opportunities
can help reduce the likelihood they will
be reeled in by one of those attacks.
Workers must use safety
equipment at all times
Unless inconvenient to do so – due to
the prevalence of malware usage in the
espionage breaches, it is advisable to
deploy and keep up-to-date solutions
that can help detect and stop those
threats.

Wide range of services, narrower range of threats
Professional Services is a broad category even by

include law offices, advertising agencies, and
engineering and design firms, to name only a few.
Starting with a focus on the data lost in the 157
Professional Services breaches, Figure 56 gives us

in these cases.

We see an overall increase in Personal data and
Credentials breached. A lot of this comes from
breaches now compromising multiple data types at
the same time. Often, credentials are the key that
opens the door for other actions. Figure 57 shows
that most of the time, it’s on the way to compromise
Internal and/or Personal data. This is indicative of
gaining access to a user’s inbox via webmail login
using stolen credentials.

Sometimes you just have to ask

for Professional Services. Financial staff were the
most likely to be compromised in incidents involving
fraudulent transactions, but it should be noted that
executives were compromised in 20 percent of the
incidentsand are 6x more likely to be the asset
compromised in Professional Services breaches than
the median industry. You have to hand it to the attackers.
At some point one must have thought “why don’t we
skip all the hard hacking and just, you know, ask for
the money?”

Paths of the unrighteous
To wrap up, Figure 59 illustrates the single
step Misuse and Error breaches, but also
shows us the Social and Hacking breaches
that take slightly longer to develop. All of it
provides excellent immediate teaching moments for any organization.

Things to consider:
One is the loneliest number
We don’t like saying it any more than you like
hearing it, but static credentials are the keys.
Password managers and two-factor authentication are the spool pins in the lock. Don’t forget to
audit where all your doors are. It doesn’t help to
put XO-9s on most of your entrances if you’ve
got one in the back rocking a screen door.
Social butterflies
You know a great way to capture credentials?

A social attack. At least we know where it’s
coming from. Monitor email for links and
executables (including macro-enabled Office
docs). Give your team a way to report potential
phishing or pretexting.
To err is human
Set your staff up for success. Monitor what
processes access personal data and add in
redundant controls so that a single mistake
doesn’t result in a breach.

Public
Administration
Cyber-Espionage is rampant in the Public sector, with
State-affiliated actors accounting for 79 percent of all
breaches involving external actors. Privilege Misuse and
Error by insiders account for 30 percent of breaches.

The most common pairings of threat actions and
assets in Table 7 tells a story that is as easy to follow
as “See Spot Send Malicious Attachments and Gain a
Foothold.” We have a gang of five threat actions found
in breaches that had a human asset and a workstation
as affected assets. We are seeing the familiar phish >
backdoor/C2 > use of the newly acquired channel into
the network. Admittedly we do not have as much data
as to what is happening beyond the deception and
initial device compromise. The inclusion of keylogging
malware is a good indicator that additional credential
theft and reuse is a likely next step.

Given the sheer number of incidents in this sector, you
would think that the government incident responders
must either be cape and tights wearing super heroes,
or so stressed they’re barely hanging on by their
fingernails. And while that may yet be the case, keep
in mind that we do have very good visibility into this
industry, in part due to regulatory requirements that
members (at least in the United States) must report
their incidents to one of our data sharing partners (the
US-CERT). Arguably more interesting is the fact that
with similar breach numbers from last year’s report,
the makeup of the breaches has seen some change.

Since we have established a bit of a problem with
malicious emails, we wanted to dig more into the
security awareness training data provided to us this
year. Figure 61 shows how quickly employees in this
sector are clicking or reporting on phishing emails.
Early on in the training similar percentages of users
are clicking and reporting, but reporting drops off
after the first hour, where clicking is more active.
Not optimal, but since this was sanctioned and not
actually malicious, nothing was done after the initial
reporting other than an “atta boy.” Having documented,
understood, and tested incident response plans to
the real thing will allow the containment process to
begin during that first hour to limit the effectiveness
and impact through quick identification. This should
also limit the opportunity for the users who are not
KonMari-ing their inboxes to interact with the malicious
message days later.

The wheels of government discover slowly
When there is enough detail to derive breach timeline
metrics, the data shows that breaches in the Public
sector are taking months and years to be discovered.
Public breaches are over 2.5 times more likely to be
undiscovered for years. Espionage-related breaches
typically do take longer to discover due to the lack of
external fraud detection, but we did not have timeline
data for those breaches. Privilege Misuse is the
most common pattern within breaches that went
undiscovered for months or more.

Understand the human factor
Not just from a phishing target standpoint.
Errors in the forms of misdelivery and
erroneous publishing of data rear their
risky heads again. Insider misuse is also
still a concern, so ensure efforts are
taken to routinely assess user privileges.
Limit the amount of damage an employee
acting inappropriately or maliciously can
do with existing privileges.
Lookin’ out my backdoor
While not as obvious as cartwheeling
giants, validate there are controls
in place to look for suspicious egress
traffic that could be indicative of
backdoor or C2 malware installation.

Not such a POS anymore
Let’s jump in our DBIR time machine and travel all the
way back to four years ago. It was the second year
that we featured the incident classification patterns
and the top pattern for Retail was POS Intrusion, along
with remote compromise of point of sale environments,
with all of the malware and payment card exfiltration
that comes with it. Coming back to the present year’s
data set in Figure 63, the times they are a-changing.

The above shift certainly supports the reduction
in POS breaches, and to a lesser extent, Payment
Card Skimming. Pay at the pump terminals at gas
stations would fall into the retail industry as well. We
are cautiously optimistic that EMV has diminished
the value proposition of card-present fraud for the
cyber-criminals in our midst. Alas, it will still not
make criminal elements eschew money and move to
self-sustaining communes to lead simpler lives.

Essentially, Web application attacks have punched the
time clock and relieved POS Intrusion of their duties.
This is not just a retail-specific phenomenon – Figure
64 comes courtesy of our friends at the National
Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) and
their tracking of card-present versus card-not-present
fraud independent of victim industry.

One door closes, kick in another one
Attacks against e-commerce web applications continue
their renaissance. This is shown in Figure 64 on the left
as well as Figure 26 back in the Results and Analysis
section. To find out more about what tactics are used
in attacks against payment applications we will go
back to pairings of threat actions and affected assets.

Card-present

50%

The general modus operandi can be gleaned from
Table 8 below. Attacker compromises a web application
and installs code into the payment application that
will capture customer payment card details as they
complete their purchases. Some breaches had details
that specified a form-grabber which would be
categorized under Spyware/Keylogger as it is another
method of user input capture. Other times limited
information was provided other than a statement

similar to “malicious code that harvested payment
card data.” The more general functionality of
capture app data was used in those instances.
In reality there is likely little to no difference between
the two pairings. We are also a little short on
information on how the web application was
compromised. If a specific method like RFI is noted,
we collect it. Often it may be a general notation
that a web vuln was exploited, hence the Exploit Vuln
variety (new to the latest version of VERIS!). Looking
at what we do know and channeling our inner William
of Ockham, this general chain of events is likely: scan

Things to consider:
Integrity is integral
The web application compromises are no
longer attacks against data at rest. Code is
being injected to capture customer data
as they enter it into web forms. Widespread
implementation of file integrity software may
not be a feasible undertaking. Adding this
to your malware defenses on payment sites
should be considered. This is, of course,
in addition to patching OS, and payment
application code.

for specific web application vulnerabilities > exploit
and gain access > drop malware > harvest payment
card data > profit. We have seen webshell backdoors
involved in between the initial hack and introduction
of malware in prior breaches. While that action was
not recorded in significant numbers in this data set,
it is an additional breadcrumb to look for in detection
efforts. In brief, vulnerable internet-facing e-commerce
applications provide an avenue for efficient, automated, and scalable attacks. And there are criminal
groups that specialize in these types of attacks that
feast on low-hanging fruit.

Brick and Mort(ar)y
Continue to embrace technologies that make it
harder for criminals to turn your POS terminals
into machines of unspeakable doom. EMV, mobile
wallets – any method that utilizes a one-time transaction code as opposed to PAN is a good thing.
Not just PCI
Payment cards are not the only data variety that
would be useful to the criminally-minded community.
Rewards programs that can be leveraged for the
“points” or for the personal information of your
customer base are also potential targets.

Wrap up
So, this concludes our 12th installment of this annual report. If the DBIR were a bottle of
decent Scotch whiskey it would cost you around 100 bucks, instead of being free like this
document. Likewise, the decisions you might make after finishing them would probably
differ wildly as well. Nevertheless, we hope you gain a certain degree of enjoyment and
enlightenment from both.

On behalf of the team that labored to produce this document, we sincerely thank you,
our readers, for your continued support and encouragement of this effort. We believe it
to be of value to Information Security professionals and to industry at large, and we are
grateful for the opportunity to bring it before you once again. As always, a tremendous
thank you to our contributors who give of their time, effort, insight, and most importantly,
their data. The task of creating this document is in no way trivial and we simply could
not do it without their generosity of resources. We look forward to bringing you our 14th
report (we are taking the high-rise hotel concept of enumeration here) next year, and in
the meantime, may your security budgets be large and your attack surface small. Until
then, feel free to reflect on the more noteworthy publicly disclosed security events in
2018 from the VTRAC before jumping into the Appendices.

We do not assert that your decisions would differ wildly as we do not have sufficient data to support that statement. It is, admittedly, a surmise on our part but internal research remains ongoing.

Year in review

January

February

March

April

On the second day of the
year, the Verizon Threat
Research Advisory Center
(VTRAC) began to learn that
researchers had discovered
“Meltdown” and “Spectre,”
new information disclosure
vulnerabilities in most
modern microprocessors.
The vulnerabilities lie in
foundational CPU architectures. Patching continued
through 2018. We collected
no reports of successful
Meltdown or Spectre attacks
in 2018. The first week of
the month included the first
report of malware attacks
targeting the 2018 Winter
Olympics in Pyeongchang,
Republic of Korea. Investigative journalists reported
India’s national ID database,
“Aadhaar,” suffered a data
breach affecting more than
1.2 billion Indian citizens.
We began collecting reports
of targeted attacks on Latin
American banks. Attackers
used disk wiping malware,
probably to eliminate
evidence of their actions
and minimize the scale
of the banks’ losses. On
January 26th, we collected
the first report of GandCrab
ransomware.

The first “zero-day” in Adobe
Flash kicked off February
after APT37 embedded
an exploit in Excel spreadsheets. The Punjab National
Bank reported fraudulent
transfers of ₹11,600 crore
(USD 1.77 billion dollars).
The Russian Central Bank
reported “unsanctioned
operations” caused the loss
of ₽339 million (€4.8 million).
“Olympic Destroyer” malware
disrupted the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang
Olympics but did not result
in their cancellation. GitHub
was hit with a new type
of reflection denial of service
attack leveraging misconfigured memcached
servers. GitHub and other
organizations endured
1.35-terabit-per-second junk
traffic storms.

Intelligence for attacks on
the Pyeongchang Olympics
continued after the February
25th closing ceremonies.
Operations Gold Dragon,
HaoBao and Honeybee
began as early as July 2017.
In March, we collected
intelligence on a full
spectrum of APT-grade
threat actors including
APT28, menuPass (APT10),
Patchwork, MuddyWater,
OilRig, Lazarus and Cobalt.
US-CERT published 15 files
with intelligence on Russian
actors attacking critical
infrastructure in the USA.
Malaysia’s Central Bank
foiled an attack that involved
falsified SWIFT wire-transfer
requests. The Drupal
project patched a remote
code execution vulnerability
reminiscent of the 2014
vulnerability that led to
“Drupalgeddon.”

Attacks on “smart install”
software in Cisco IOS
switches by Russian threat
actors were probably the
most noteworthy InfoSec
risk development in April.
The VTRAC collected
updated intelligence on the
“Energetic Bear” Russian
actor. A supply-chain attack
on Latitude Technologies
forced four natural-gas
pipeline operators to
temporarily shut down
computer communications
with their customers.
Latitude supplies Electronic
Data Interchange (EDI)
services to the Energy and
Oil verticals. March’s Drupal
vulnerability did indeed
attract cybercriminals. A
variant of the Mirai IoT
botnet began scanning for
vulnerable Drupal servers
and the subsequent
compromises to install
cryptomining software
became known as
Drupalgeddon2. The
cyber-heist of US$150,000
in Ethereum from
MyEtherWallet paled in
significance to the BGP
hijacking of the Internet’s
infrastructure to do it.

Intelligence about the
“Double Kill” zero-day
vulnerability in Internet

the end of April. In May, the
VTRAC collected intelligence
of a malicious PDF document with two more zero-day
vulnerabilities, one each in
Adobe PDF Reader and in
Windows. Microsoft and
Adobe patched all three
on May’s Patch Tuesday.
A surge in GandCrab
ransomware infections were
the focus of several of the
best intelligence collections
in May. New intelligence
collections documented
the Cobalt threat actor’s
phishing campaign was
targeting the financial
sector. Multiple sources
reported VPNFilter malware
had infected routers and
network-attached storage
(NAS) appliances. Control
the router—control the traffic
passing through it.

Multiple sources released
updated intelligence on
North Korean threat actors
engaged in cyber-conflict
and cybercrime operations.
Adobe patched a new
zero-day vulnerability in
Flash. Like February’s, Flash
zero-day, it was being used
in malicious Excel files but
the targets were in the
Middle East. Two Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce
subsidiaries – BMO (Bank
of Montreal) and Simplii
Financial suffered a leak
of about 90,000 customer
records. They learned of the
breach when threat actors
demanded US$750,000 for
the return of the records.
The Lazarus threat actor
stole roughly KR ₩35 billion
(around $31 million) in
cryptocurrency from the
South Korea-based
exchange Bithumb. DanaBot,
a new banking Trojan was
discovered targeting
Commonwealth Bank in
Australia.

The first major Magecart
attack in 2018 was
Ticketmaster’s UK branch.
Hackers compromised
Inbenta, a third-party
functionality supplier. From
Inbenta they placed digital
skimmers on several
Ticketmaster websites.
The Ticketmaster attack
was part of a campaign
targeting third-party
providers to perform
widespread compromises of
card data. July’s Magecart
collections included
indicators of compromise of
over 800 victim websites.
A malicious Mobile Device
Management platform was
used in highly targeted
attacks on 13 iPhones and
some Android and Windows
platforms. Russia’s PIR Bank
lost ₽58 million ($920,000)
after the MoneyTaker actor
compromised an outdated,
unsupported Cisco router at
a branch office and used it to
pivot into the bank’s network.

The second Boundary
Gateway Protocol (BGP)
hijacking to steal
cryptocurrency in 2018
redirected legitimate traffic
from an Amazon DNS server.
The malicious DNS server
redirected users of
MyEtherWallet to a spoofed
site that harvested their
credentials. Users of the
service lost Ethereum worth
about $152,000. Cosmos
Bank in Pune, India, was the
victim of US$13.4 million of
fraudulent SWIFT and ATM
transfers. The US Dept.
of Justice announced the
arrests of three managers
from the FIN7 (Anunak,
Carbanak, Carbon Spider)
threat actor. Intelligence
indicated a new vulnerability
in Apache Struts, CVE-201811776, was following the
course set by March 2017’s
CVE-2017-9805, the
Jakarta multi-parser Struts
vulnerability. The 2017
vulnerability led to the
Equifax data breach. A
detailed code reuse
examination of malware
linked to North Korea linked
most malware attacks to
the Lazarus Group. APT37
was linked to a small portion
but was assessed to be
more skilled and reserved for
attacks with national
strategic objectives.

establishments in the USA.
The Magecart threat actors
executed a scaled supply

7000+ e-commerce sites.
Detailed reports in August
and October indicated the
Cobalt threat actor had
reorganized into a group with
journeymen and apprentice
members and a second
group of masters reserved
for more sophisticated
campaigns.

Intelligence based on
examination of Magecart
malware indicated there
are at least six independent
threat actors conducting
Magecart attacks. The initial
Magecart successes in late
2016 and high-profile attacks
beginning with Ticketmaster
UK/Inbenta in June led to a
bandwagon effect. Other
threat actors copied and
improved upon the TTP of
early Magecart threat
actor(s). The SamSam
ransomware attack came to
a standstill after two Iranian
hackers were indicted for
US$6 million extortion.
Cisco released an advisory
due to “active exploitation”
of a vulnerability in Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliance
Software (ASA) and Cisco
Firepower Threat Defense
Software that could allow
an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of

Activity Alert AA18-284A,
“Publicly Available Tools

Worldwide,” on five tools
threat actors had been using
for their “Living off the Land”
tactics. Marriott announced
a 2014-18 breach had
exposed the records of up
to 500 million customers
in its Starwood hotels
reservation system.

VTRAC collections in
December began with
“Operation Poison Needles.”
An unidentified actor
exploited the third Adobe
Flash zero-day vulnerability
to attack Polyclinic of the
Presidential Administration
of Russia. “Operation
Sharpshooter” was a global
campaign targeting nuclear,
defense, energy and
financial companies. Oil and
gas services contractor
Saipem suffered an attack
that employed a new variant
of Shamoon disk-wiping
malware. December’s
Patch Tuesday fixed
CVE-2018-8611, the latest
Windows zero-day being
exploited by the FruityArmor
APT threat actor. Partly in
reaction to the 77 percent
plunge in Bitcoin, cybercriminals did not abandon
cryptomining altogether,
instead, SamSam and
GandCrab ransomware
were being used to attack
corporations, government
agencies, universities and
other large organizations.
Criminals targeted larger
purses: organizations likely
to pay ransom in lieu of
days of lost business and
productivity recovering from
backups, re-imaging or other
BCP/DR measures. At the
end of 2018 the VTRAC was

Appendix A:
Transnational hacker debriefs
Insights into their target selection
and tactics, techniques and procedures
– Michael D’Ambrosio, Deputy Assistant Director, United States Secret Service

Over the past fifteen years, the United States Secret Service has successfully
identified, located, and arrested numerous high-value cybercriminals. These
individuals were responsible for some of the most significant and widely publicized
data breaches of public and private industry networks. Over this period, the Secret
Service’s Cyber Division has cultivated mutually beneficial partnerships with law
enforcement agencies around the globe, which has extended the reach of the
Secret Service’s investigative efforts far beyond its traditional limits. This network
of collaborative partners has enabled the Secret Service to successfully extradite
criminal suspects located overseas and have them face prosecution in the United
States. The Secret Service continues to forge new international partnerships in
furtherance of its mission to pursue and apprehend cybercriminals regardless of
their geography.
As part of its mandate to combat financially motivated cybercrime, the Secret Service
combines its investigative efforts with educational outreach programs. These are
aimed at strengthening the ability of private and public sector entities to protect
themselves against a range of cybercrimes. The Secret Service conducts in-depth
analyses of the activities, tools, and methodologies used by the cybercriminals during
the commission of their crimes to better assess the evolving threats that cybercriminals pose to financial institutions and other potential targets. The Secret Service then
shares the results of these reviews with its network of public and private partners
through its outreach programs.
The Secret Service’s Cyber Division has learned that the most prescient information
about cybercrime trends often comes from the cybercriminals themselves. The
Secret Service conducts extensive debriefings of arrested cybercriminals and uses
their first-hand knowledge to understand more fully the spectrum of variables they
used to identify and select a particular target for intrusion and exploitation. The
Secret Service has recently completed such debriefings with a handful of highly
skilled cybercriminals who were responsible for some of the most significant network
intrusions in history, and has found that the ways in which these individuals select
their targets and perpetrate their crimes share certain common features.

66

Cybercriminals prey upon human error, IT security complacency, and technical
deficiencies present in computer networks all over the world. Individually, each of
these tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) discussed below are not always
initially successful and may seem easily mitigated; it is when multiple TTPs are
utilized in concert that cybercriminals are able to gain and maintain access to a
computer network, no matter their motives. Once they are inside a network their
process is almost always the same: establish continued access, escalate or obtain
administrator privileges, move slowly and quietly to map the entire network, look
for open ports, locate the “crown jewels,” and exfiltrate the data undetected for as
long as possible.
The selection of a target is a continual process. Cybercriminals do their research.
Almost always during these interviews, the hackers referred to gathering valuable
intelligence from the same cybersecurity blogs, online IT security publications, and
vulnerability reports that network administrators should be monitoring. They know
that once a vulnerability is revealed, they still have a limited amount of time to try to
exploit that vulnerability at a potential victim organization. Every time a vulnerability
is disclosed or a system update or patch is released, a hacker sees an opportunity.
They research the disclosure or update notes to learn if they can exploit the vulnerability and where, searching for their best opportunity to monetize the vulnerability.
Hackers also communicate vulnerability information and exploit techniques on
hacking forums. Once a target is selected, the hacker conducts thorough research
into the victim organization and their network(s), often using free and commercially
available Internet scanning tools that reveal extremely useful information about the
victim company’s network.
Webserver and/or webpage hacking has been a highly successful primary attack
vector, as there are various potential avenues for exploitation. These include the
main website of an institution or a less protected linked website, which in turn can
provide access to the main network. The added use of Structured Query Language
(SQL) database injections of malicious code has been a very effective attack vector
because these types of intrusion techniques can be deployed at any access point
of a website. There are additional webserver attack vectors such as overlooked or
forgotten IP addresses, possibly from development or beta-testing and external
webservers or data servers that share the same or common domain. Unmanaged
servers that still utilize Unicode can be exploited via encoding the URL with certain
characters to bypass application filters.
Other traditional and effective attack vectors should not be overlooked. These include
spear phishing for login credentials or malware delivery and “Man in the Middle”
attacks through poorly secured routers or web gateways. Botnets are a relatively
inexpensive tool that have been used to degrade or brute force attack networks in
connection with parallel tactics. A very skilled hacker admitted to the Secret Service
that he ended up paying a collusive employee (insider threat) when all of his other
hacking attempts to access a foreign bank’s network were unsuccessful.

67

Once inside a network, cybercriminals continue to do their research and
reconnaissance. Hackers often examine a webserver’s default error pages because
those pages expose a lot of the target network’s system information. Cybercriminals
take all of network information they can collect and utilize virtual machines (VMs)
to build a mock system to emulate the network of the victim company. This is done
both for testing their methods of exploitation and for better understanding the types
of network defenses present within the system.
The exploits used by cybercriminals inside a target network depend on the installed
network defenses. Undoubtedly, the hacker will try to install a web shell to ensure
access into the system. Another sustainment method is the use of cross-site scripting
(XSS) for session hijacking (cookie stealing) of a valid user through malicious
code injections into a user’s JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash, or other code bank. The use
of malware delivered to the valid user via spear phishing is a key component of
this process.
In addition, hackers utilize directory transversal attacks (directory climbing, backtracking, etc.) on web servers to attempt to reach otherwise restricted directories,
such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) private keys and password files. Hackers can even
execute commands on the server by accessing such directories. After administrator
privileges are obtained, it is common for the prized data to be exfiltrated by tunneling
via a remote access protocol. Cybercriminals will also scan for open ports and
attempt to install software of their choosing on non-standard ports for a variety
of malicious uses. If the targeted network has the potential to provide valuable
data continuously, diligent hackers will continuously clean up their “tracks” within
the exploited network to obfuscate their presence indefinitely. Another prominent
hacker described having persistent access into a company’s networks for 10 years
using multiple “backdoors” (web shells) and continually cleaning up his “work” to go
undetected. In reality, many of the hackers we debriefed often stated that they could
see traces of other hackers in the targeted network which sometimes made it harder
to hide their hacking exploits.
These are just some of the tactics, techniques and procedures the Secret Service
has observed used by criminal groups to exploit victim networks. The threat is real
and the adversary is constantly evolving, driven by diverse and varying motivations.
Their success is more often dependent on how well network administrators can
adapt their defenses to potential vulnerabilities as they are revealed.
The Secret Service will continue to pursue, arrest, and prosecute cybercriminals no
matter where they are and we will continue to provide valuable attack methodology
analysis from our investigations to better improve the cybersecurity efforts of our
partners in law enforcement, academia, and the public and private sectors alike.

Appendix B:
Methodology
One of the things readers value most about this report is the level of rigor and
integrity we employ when collecting, analyzing, and presenting data. Knowing our
readership cares about such things and consumes this information with a keen eye
helps keep us honest. Detailing our methods is an important part of that honesty.
Our overall methodology remains intact and largely unchanged from previous years.
All incidents included in this report were individually reviewed and converted
(if necessary) into the VERIS framework to create a common, anonymous aggregate
data set. If you are unfamiliar with the VERIS framework, it is short for Vocabulary
for Event Recording and Incident Sharing, it is free to use, and links to VERIS
resources are at the beginning of this report.
The collection method and conversion techniques differed between contributors. In
general, three basic methods (expounded below) were used to accomplish this:
1. Direct recording of paid external forensic investigations and related intelligence
operations conducted by Verizon using the VERIS Webapp.
2. Direct recording by partners using VERIS.
3. Converting partners existing schema into VERIS.
All contributors received instruction to omit any information that might identify
organizations or individuals involved.
Reviewed spreadsheets and VERIS Webapp JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) are
ingested by an automated workflow that converts the incidents and breaches within
into the VERIS JSON format as necessary, adds missing enumerations, and then
validates the record against business logic and the VERIS schema. The automated
workflow subsets the data and analyzes the results. Based on the results of this
exploratory analysis, the validation logs from the workflow, and discussions with the
partners providing the data, the data is cleaned and re-analyzed. This process runs
nightly for roughly three months as data is collected and analyzed.
Incident eligibility
For a potential entry to be eligible for the incident/breach corpus, a couple of
requirements must be met. The entry must be a confirmed security incident, defined
as a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. In addition to meeting the baseline
definition of “security incident” the entry is assessed for quality. We create a subset
of incidents (more on subsets later) that pass our quality filter. The details of what is
a “quality” incident are:

69

•	
The incident must have at least seven enumerations (e.g., threat actor variety,
threat action category, variety of integrity loss, et al.) across 34 fields OR
be a DDoS attack. Exceptions are given to confirmed data breaches with less
than seven enumerations.
•	
The incident must have at least one known VERIS threat action category
(hacking, malware, etc.)
In addition to having the level of detail necessary to pass the quality filter, the incident
must be within the timeframe of analysis, (November 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018
for this report). The 2018 caseload is the primary analytical focus of the report, but
the entire range of data is referenced throughout, notably in trending graphs. We
also exclude incidents and breaches affecting individuals that cannot be tied to an
organizational attribute loss. If your friend’s personal laptop was hit with CryptoLocker
it would not be included in this report.
Lastly, for something to be eligible for inclusion into the DBIR, we have to know about
it, which brings us to sample bias.
Acknowledgement of sample bias
We would like to reiterate that we make no claim that the findings of this report are
representative of all data breaches in all organizations at all times. Even though
the combined records from all our contributors more closely reflect reality than any
of them in isolation, it is still a sample. And although we believe many of the findings
presented in this report to be appropriate for generalization (and our confidence
in this grows as we gather more data and compare it to that of others), bias
undoubtedly exists. Unfortunately, we cannot measure exactly how much bias exists
(i.e., in order to give a precise margin of error). We have no way of knowing what
proportion of all data breaches are represented because we have no way of knowing
the total number of data breaches across all organizations in 2018. Many breaches
go unreported (though our sample does contain many of those). Many more are as
yet unknown by the victim (and thereby unknown to us).
While we believe many of the findings presented in this report to be appropriate,
generalization, bias, and methodological flaws undoubtedly exist. However, with 73
contributing organizations this year, we’re aggregating across the different collection
methods, priorities, and goals of our partners. We hope this aggregation will help
minimize the influence of any individual shortcomings in each of the samples, and the
whole of this research will be greater than the sum of its parts.
Statistical analysis
We strive for statistical correctness in the DBIR. In this year’s data sample, the confidence
interval is at least +/- 2% for breaches and +/- 0.5% for incidents. Smaller samples of
the data (such as breaches within the Espionage pattern) will be even wider as the size
is smaller. We have tried to treat every statement within the DBIR as a hypothesis based
on exploratory analysis and ensure that each statement is accurate at a given confidence
level (normally 95%). We’ve tried to express this confidence in the conditional probability
bar charts explained in the “tidbits” that precede the Table of Contents.
18

19

19

Bayes method, 95% confidence level.
If you wonder why we treat them as hypotheses rather than findings, to confirm or deny our hypothesis would requires a second, unique data set we had not inspected ahead of time.

70

Our data is non-exclusively multinomial meaning a single feature, such as “Action,”
can have multiple values (i.e., “social,” “malware,” and “hacking”). This means that
percentages do not necessarily add up to 100 percent. For example, if there are 5
botnet breaches, the sample size is 5. However, since each botnet used phishing,
installed keyloggers, and used stolen credentials, there would be 5 social actions, 5
hacking actions, and 5 malware actions, adding up to 300 percent. This is normal,
expected, and handled correctly in our analysis and tooling.
Another important point is that, when looking at the findings, “unknown” is equivalent
to “unmeasured.” Which is to say that if a record (or collection of records) contain elements that have been marked as “unknown” (whether it is something as basic as the
number of records involved in the incident, or as complex as what specific capabilities
a piece of malware contained) it means that we cannot make statements about that
particular element as it stands in the record—we cannot measure where we have too
little information. Because they are “unmeasured,” they are not counted in sample
sizes. The enumeration “Other” is, however, counted as it means the value was known
but not part of VERIS. Finally, “Not Applicable” (normally “NA”) may be counted or not
counted depending on the hypothesis.
Data Subsets
We already mentioned the subset of incidents that passed our quality requirements,
but as part of our analysis there are other instances where we define subsets of
data. These subsets consist of legitimate incidents that would eclipse smaller trends
if left in. These are removed and analyzed separately (as called out in the relevant
sections). This year we have two subsets of legitimate incidents that are not analyzed
as part of the overall corpus:
1. 	
We separately analyzed a subset of web servers that were identified as secondary
targets (such as taking over a website to spread malware).
2. We separately analyze botnet-related incidents.
Both subsets were separately analyzed last year as well.
Finally, we create some subsets to help further our analysis. In particular, a single
subset is used for all analysis within the DBIR unless otherwise stated. It includes only
quality incidents as described above and the aforementioned two subsets.
Non-incident data
Since 2015, the DBIR includes data that requires the analysis that did not fit into our
usual categories of “incident” or “breach.” Examples of non-incident data include
malware, patching, phishing, DDoS, and other types of data. The sample sizes for
non-incident data tend to be much larger than the incident data, but from fewer
sources. We make every effort to normalize the data, (for example reporting on the
median organization rather than the average of all data). We also attempt to combine
multiple contributors with similar data to conduct the analysis wherever possible.
Once analysis is complete, we try to discuss our findings with the relevant contributor
or contributors so as to validate it against their knowledge of the data.

Appendix C:
Watching the watchers
Last year in the “Feeling vulnerable?” appendix, we discussed the services or
weaknesses attackers look for in spray and pray internet scans, and how those aren’t
necessarily the same things they look for in targeted attacks. In this section, we again
examine what services are open to the internet and the adversary activity against
them. At the risk of stating the obvious, what the attacker looks for tells you a great
deal about what is of value to them.
Any port in a storm
Ports that offer at least some value to, and at the same time require the least amount
of investment from the attacker garner a lot of attention. An economist might call
the amount invested by the actor per attack the marginal cost. The very best attacks
from the criminal’s point of view would cost almost nothing per target. We will refer to
these as zero-marginal-cost attacks.

Port rank in DDoS attacks
Figure 65. Comparison of ports in DDoS and honeypot attacks

72

Figure 65 illustrates the ports that are in the top 50 for both honeypot activity
and DDoS attacks (with “1” in the upper right being the most common and the rest
decreasing from that point). We can consider how often attackers look for a given port
as an indicator for how valuable they are to the attacker. Ports below the red line, such
as cLDAP (389), DNS (53), and NTP (123) are more valuable due to their DDoS amplification potential. The ports above the red line are more valuable for their non-DDoS
malevolence including SSH (22), telnet (23), HTTP (8080), NetBIOS (445), and others.
Portémon Go
Probably the most effective way to judge perceived value for the attacker for a given
port in zero-marginal-cost attacks is to examine their ranking in honeypot scans vs
their general population ranking on the Internet. There are a myriad of organizations
that scan the internet regularly, and there are a few of those who are gracious
enough to contribute to the DBIR. As a result, we can share this data in Figure 66.

Figure 66 lists the top 10 ports by ratio of honeypot activity to internet prevelance.
Some of these, for example, Telnet, NetBIOS, and SQL Server – legacy services with
known weaknesses that are old enough to vote – may not be as common as dirt, but
they still exist and when an attacker finds them you can almost hear the intro to Pink
Floyd’s “Money” floating in the ether. If your organization has any of these services
exposed to the internet, it’s probably a good idea to go and take care of that now.
We’ll wait here. Take your time. This report changes once a year, but those ports are
being hammered daily.
20

Dime a dozen
The above section begs the question, “If those ports are what attackers frequently
search for but rarely find, which open ports are plentiful but rarely sought?” We are
glad you asked. For the most part they are unassigned or ephemeral ports. Of more
interest are the ports that appear in vulnerability scans, but do not show up in honeypots. Figure 67 gives us some insight into that area. The main takeaway is that there
are a lot of ports far down on the list from a honeypot perspective (the big cluster in
the lower left of the figure) that get reported often in vulnerability scans. Those are
the vulnerabilities that may be useful for attackers but either only for niche attacks or
internal pivoting, or are of absolutely no interest whatsoever to the attacker.

20

For example, if a port was the top ranked port in honeypot scans and the 15th most common on the internet, its ratio would be 15x.

Take action
There may only be seven seas, but there are 65,535 ports. While not all are found in
the figures above, a great many are. So now what? We suggest you take a look to
ascertain if you are vulnerable to any zero-marginal-cost attacks (easily identified by
their honeypot to internet scan ratio). If so, you are operating below a critical security
threshold and you need to take action to get above it. Are you running a honeypot
yourself? If not, why is that port open? Finally, take a cue from the Unbroken Chains
section and be smart about what else you mitigate. Understand the paths attackers
are most likely to take in order to exploit those services.
