Abstract—This paper encompasses the review of the malware
Wifatch that was discovered in 2014, how it has impacted
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, how it has changed the typical
perception of malware having a malicious nature, and what has
been revealed in its role in security.

setting up honeypots in efforts to collect samples of this
embedded device targeted malware. Generally, home routers
are often used by cyber criminals to perform acts such as
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Unsuspecting
users would not have noticed the difference as it tends to go
unnoticed as how other infections are [6].

Keywords—Malware; Linux; Symantec; Internet of Things;

I. INTRODUCTION
According to Fisher (2018), the composition of the word
“malware” originates from the combination of “malicious”, and
“software”. It is used to depict the nature of software that is
created with ill intentions such as intrusion of permission on a
computer to steal personal information through the usage of a
backdoor. Software that behaves in such a way that it wasn’t
intended to could also be classified as a malware [1]. They
exist in forms such as rootkits, spyware, Trojans, adwares,
viruses, and worms – all of which are used to complete tasks
such as stealing data that are protected, deleting, or even
adding software without the user’s approval, or
acknowledgement [2].
In a modernized world, the need for a globalized devices,
and network of machines that are capable of interacting with
one another is the basis of Internet of Things – which is also
known as Internet of Everything. In simpler terms, IoT is
defined as devices that are linked to the Internet, and are
equipped with sensors, and actuators [3] [4].
By infiltrating a vulnerable Telnet authentication, Wifatch
uses a backdoor through routers at home to communicate with
a Command & Control (C&C) server. What makes it unique is
that although it is classified as a malware, it acts a guard
against other forms of infection without any malicious intent to
its host – hence, it is categorized as a white – hat Trojan [5].

II. THE DISCOVERY
In 2014, an unusual activity was detected on a home router
by an independent security researcher in which the process
was not part of the original device’s software. Upon further
investigation, an intricate, and sophisticated code - designed in
Perl - was discovered that had caused the router to
involuntarily connect to other infected network of peer – to –
peer devices. This was further investigated by Symantec by

Unlike other malwares, this particular subject is dubbed as
the “vigilante” of its kind. This is due to the fact that it serves
one purpose – to protect the devices that it infects. By
identifying weak, or unchanged passwords through hacking
Telnet, and other protocols. It would then disable Telnet after
scanning for known malwares in the device to avoid further
infections. Although there is potential in misusing the
backdoor created by Wifatch, it was never put into use for
anything of sorts – which leads to experts believing that it was
part of the “IoT vigilantes” effort in securing devices that were
at risk [7].

III. IMPACT ON IOT
It has been reported that there were speculations whereby
Wifatch was created in attempts to fend against surveillance by
governmental agencies – for instance, National Security
Agency (NSA). A comment left in the piece of code quoted
from Richard Stallman in this malware hints on defending
constitutional rights of the people. Knowing the nature of how
home routers could be used as a medium to spread updates
without acknowledgement from the user – this malware will
urge the device’s owner to make use of stronger passwords,
aside from updating the current firmware as such ignorance
could lead to future mishaps. In order to “prevent” certain
devices such as the CCTV (of which Wifatch is unable to
“protect” against other malwares), it was designed to reboot the
system after a certain period of time - taking advantage of the
fact that malwares in embedded systems are not as persistent,
and that a reinstallation must take place for them to take effect.
Although it is concerning, the researchers have found that the
commands that were passed through the backdoor were
cryptographically signed. In other words, this indicates that
only the original author would be able to control what it does.
In turn, this cuts the chances of the said malware of being
manipulated by malicious hijackers. Interestingly enough, the
Internet is claimed to be at a safer state – all thanks to Wifatch
[8][9].

IV. THE GOOD AND THE BAD
Known for its “good” intentions”, Symantec’s Mario
Ballano made a point that it could be manipulated to inflict
detrimental damage at any given time through its general –
purpose back doors. It is still regarded as a malware since it
infects the device without the user’s consent. Relying on a
malware to “guard” one’s system would not exactly be a wise
choice, and thus it is still placed under careful watch [10].
The positives gained from Wifatch’s release:
 For educational purposes, and to encourage learning.
This is supported by the fact that the Perl code was not
obscure, and that the creator was not concerned of
having it being inspected, nor shared. The source code
was only compressed, and minified. Released version of
it did not contain the private key, selected parts of the
C&C, and infection code to prevent misuse [7].
 To promote better understanding in the need to heighten
security measures.
If in the wrong hands, the botnets are able to carry out
DDoS attacks through the infected routers. Hence, it
raises the issue in the importance of addressing default
security configurations before it is taken advantage of.
 Increasing security in general.
 Counteracting against illegal mining of Bitcoin.
 Saving bandwidth by cancelling out other malware
scans.
 Reduces interruption of service, reboots, and overheat
of device.
 Saving credentials from being stolen.
It is noted that the creation, and spread of the malware is
originally caused by the neglect of the user themselves:

With over a year spent on ways to reliably shut down the
Telnet’s port, implementing malware detection, and functions
for disinfecting the system, on top of the technicalities within
bootstrapping a botnet – everything within Wifatch’s
functionalities was a challenge.
Wifatch was never meant to be kept a secret, and upon
agreement of free licensing under General Public License – it
was made public. The creator firmly stated that although the
created malware holds no ill intentions – users should not use
this as a form of comfort, and safety. The known issues, and
security holes must be dealt immediately. It does not utilize
0day exploits, nor elaborate backdoors to infiltrate a system,
and its target only comprises of unprotected devices.
Users are open to experiment with the codes available on
almost an x86 or AMD64 Linux Kernel by loading them on
the same directory with a stable network access in order to
connect to the P2P network with the option of obtaining the
extension modules, and upgrading the bot. It will create a
database directory upon finding a suitable mountpoint. Users
must keep in mind that there is no warranty for self
experimentation. Not only that, users are encouraged to
volunteer to help as more reliable machines are needed in
order to serve as a backend database for malware signatures.
Generally, this botnet requires a full network access to enable
it to scan vulnerable devices. It is reachable via UDP, and TCP
with the range 32769 – 65534. Infections are carried out from
a centralized point, and only a single keypress is needed if
anything goes sour.
When asked if the same creator was behind Carna botnet,
it was declined. Inspiration was derived from the collected
data of the said botnet. The team remains anonymous, though
goes by the name “The White Team”.
VI. INFECTION STATISTICS

 Leaving default security configurations, and passwords.
 Lack of concern, and awareness among users.
 Poor habit, and encouragement by Internet Service
Providers (ISP) to retain original credentials for easier
maintenance.
 Insecure Telnet protocol.

V. BACKGROUND
Inspired by Carna botnet, the idea of Wifatch was to
challenge the idea of not being able to create something of
similar sorts whereby it challenges the existing security level
of embedded devices. It is considered to be “virtually
nonexistent”, and thus giving rise for the need to “protect”
these vulnerable users. As Carna botnet before it, it was
crucial to act against the vulnerability that existed.

secure the device is to begin with. A protected hardware
would not have contracted the malware in the first place. An
invasion of privacy is still what it is even if it is doing no
harm. In the end, there is little that could be done if not for the
mindset of the users themselves to initiate the change.

Figure 2: Infected Countries Breakdown [6]

Figure 1 depicts the three major architectures that were
found to be infected with this malware. ARM architecture is
most prevalent as it is the most used firmware partnered with
complimenting cores known to be used by multiple successful
companies such as Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and even
Samsung Electronics. This is makes up the majority of mobile
devices, and embedded systems. MiPS is known to be used in
gaming consoles, supercomputers, and even in automobiles.
Certain embedded systems utilize SH4 in cellular phones, LCD
TVs, and NAS. Whilst not included in the chart – it is reported
that X86, and PowerPC holds a miniscule percentage of 0.132
of total infection percentage [6].
Based on figure 2, the countries affected are listed down
accordingly. However, it is to be noted that the percentage
breakdown may not be as depicted as the malware is removed
upon resetting the said infected device. It may also become
infected after time if the router’s firmware is not up to date, or
is still using its default password [6].

VII. CONCLUSION
While the creation is meant for good use, the users should
never grow too comfortable in relying on a white – hat
malware to take care of a security issue when it could have
been issued with as simple as changing the default credentials
of a router. As quoted by Harrington (n.d.), “Violating systems
as a path to remediation is not the right way to go” [11].

not this malware holds more potential in harming, or
protecting one’s device. The debate lies in the nature of how
