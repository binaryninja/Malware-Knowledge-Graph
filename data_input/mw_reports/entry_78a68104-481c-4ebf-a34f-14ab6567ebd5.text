A new Chinese MBRLocker called DexLocker has been discovered that asks for 30 Yuan to
get access to a computer. First discovered by security researcher JAMESWT, this
ransomware will modify the master boot record of the victim's computer so that it shows a
ransom note before Windows starts.
Unfortunately, I was not able to get this sample to run, so I have no first hand analysis of this
ransomware. The AnyRun video posted by JAMESWT, though, shows that once you install
the ransomware, it immediately reboots the computer and the victim is greeted with an ascii
skull and a message to send 30 yaun to the 2055965068 qq address in order to get access to
their computer again.

Microsoft's Windows Defender Security Team saw Jame's tweet and tweeted that they have
labeled the MBRLocker as Ransom:DOS/Dexcrypt.A and that it can be detected by Windows
Defender.

ICYMI: New #ransomware writes code to the Master Boot Record (MBR) and immediately
restarts computer to show a note that asks for 30 yuan as ransom. Windows Defender AV
detects and blocks this ransomware as Ransom:Win32/Dexcrypt and its MBR-writing code as
Ransom:DOS/Dexcrypt.A. https://t.co/wpD0wJeSIu

According to kangxiaopao, you can enter the ssssss password to gain access. If this password
does not work and it does only replace the MBR, it can be fixed by booting up into the
Windows Recovery Console and restoring the Master Boot Record using the following
commands:
bootrec /RebuildBcd
bootrec /fixMbr
bootrec /fixboot

Once you enter these commands, you can reboot and get access again to Windows again.

Very interesting - especially the tiny amount asked for in the
ransom note.
Why so little? the obvious answer is that many people wouldn't
quibble, or try to fix the situation themselves, if they could just
make it go away for less than $5.
Perhaps, though, it's that you get more than you bargained for,
with your $5 payment - or maybe, you get less than you need.. Smoke and mirrors?
