Organization's Attacks

Pat Bear (APT-C-37): Continued to expose attacks on an
armed organization
I. Overview
Since October 2015, the Pat Bear Organization (APT-C-37) has launched an organized,
planned, and targeted long-term uninterrupted attack against an armed organization. Its
attack platform is Windows and Android. Up to now, 360 Beaconlab has captured 32
Android platform attack samples, 13 Windows platform attack samples, and 7 C&C domain
names.
Due to its own political and religious issues, an armed organization has become the target
of many hackers and countries. In March 2017, an armed group, the Amaq Media Channel,
issued a warning message reminding visitors that the site has been infiltrated, and anyone
who visits the site will be asked to download a virus file that pretends to be a Flash installer.
From the news, we determined that an armed organization is the target of the action, and
its load delivery method includes at least a puddle attack.
Through analysis, we found that a major C&C used by the racquet bear organization is
located in a certain country in the Middle East, and the C&C used by the golden rat
organization [1] of the same period belongs to the same network segment. Further analysis
and comparison, the two organizations have strong correlation, and both contain their own
unique RAT.
Since the target of the patted bear organization is aimed at an armed organization that
supports dual-platform attacks, there has been only one unique animal in the Middle East
with a soldier certificate in history, combining some other characteristics of the organization
and 360 pairs of APT. The organization's naming rules, we named the organization a role
name in the DOTA game - pat the bear.

Second, the load delivery
The way of patted bear tissue load delivery is mainly puddle attack.
Puddle attack
Al Swarm News Agency website (see Figure 2.1) is a media website belonging to an armed
organization. For the same reason, it has also suffered various attacks from all over the
world. It has changed several domain names and the website has been offline. In addition
to the puddle attack on the Amaq media website mentioned above, we found that Al Swarm
News Agency was also used by the organization for puddle attacks.

The puddle attack mode is to replace the normal APP of the Al Swarm station with a
malicious APP inserted into the RAT. The RAT specific download link and the link
corresponding file MD5 are shown in Table 1.

website, we also found that some other historical puddle attacks used by the organization
are shown in Table 2, including the specific download links and links for Android and

Third, the way of induction
The patted bear organization mainly uses the following two induction methods in this
operation:
Camouflage with normal APP function
In order to be better evasive, in addition to camouflage the file icon, the RAT is also inserted
into the normal APP, such as an app called "‫"زوﺟﺎت اﻟﺮﺳﻮل‬, which displays the normal
interface after running. However, when the specified broadcast is received, espionage
occurs in the background.

Fourth, RAT attack sample analysis
Up to now, the bat shooting organization has used several different RATs for Android and
Windows.
Android
There are three RATs used in the Android side. Two of them (DroidJack and SpyNote) are
more frequently used commercial RATs. They have been spread on multiple hacking forums
5/15

and have been detected and exposed by many security companies. And we think that it was
developed specifically for this attack, we are named SSLove, which only appeared in the
event and has been updated in several versions.
DroidJack
Droidjack is an extremely popular RAT with its own official website, powerful and convenient
management tools. The organization uses Droidjack in addition to direct use; it will also be
inserted into the normal APP to hide, interestingly, SSLove will also be inserted into the app,
which means that the app will have two RATs at the same time.

Figure 4.1 Droidjack management tool interface diagram
SpyNote
SpyNote is similar to Droidjack. Although the Snap Bear organization uses SpyNote, the RAT
has been used for a limited number of times in this attack.

6/15

Figure 4.2 SpyNote management tool interface diagram
SSLove
This is a RAT that was not previously exposed. According to the special character
"runmylove" contained in the RAT, combined with it is the first RAT found to use SqlServer
to implement instruction interaction, we named SSLove. The latest version of SSLove has
features such as stealing text messages, contacts, WhatsApp and Telegram data, and
uploading files using FTP.
The organization uses SSLove in the same way as the Droidjack, one of which is used
directly, in which the Al Swarm website mentioned above is used by the camouflage APP
used by the bear organization for puddle attacks; the other is the insertion. Hide it in the
normal app.

Windows
There are three RATs used on the Windows side, all of which have been popular in the
Middle East for several years. Two of them (njRAT and H-worm) have been exposed multiple
times, but they are still active.
NjRAT
NjRAT[2], also known as Bladeabindi, can control the registry, processes, files, etc. of the
controlled terminal through the control terminal, and can also record the keyboard of the
controlled terminal. At the same time, njRAT uses a plug-in mechanism to extend the
functionality of njRAT through different plug-ins.
The organization is mostly not directly used when using njRAT, but is sub-encapsulated on
the basis of njRAT, using C# to add a shell to njRAT, and a lot of confusion about the shell
code. The role of the shell is to load njRAT in memory to prevent njRAT from being detected
by anti-virus software. This is the case when the Amaq website mentioned above is used by
the organization to masquerade as an Adobe Flash Player.

H-Worm
H-Worm is a VBS (Visual Basic Script) based RAT. For information on the RAT, refer to
FireEye's previous detailed report "Now You See Me - H-worm by Houdini" [3]. The attack
used the H-Worm version after the confusion, and after the confusion was removed, we
found that the list of instructions did not change.

Fkn0wned
Fkn0wned is a RAT written in VB.NET. This attack uses an earlier version. It only receives the
"DOWNLOAD" command. The DDoS function code does not work. The RAT is actually a
downloader.

V. Distribution of the attacked area
Up to now, 360 Campfire Lab found that there were 11 countries affected by the attack on
the bear organization attack. Through inquiry, it can be known that there are some armed
organizations in these countries. Obviously, the cause of this distribution is caused by
several targeted puddle attacks used by the organization.

Sixth, traceability and relevance
360 bonfire laboratory through the analysis of the bat bat attack activity, combined with the
previous analysis of the gold rat organization, we found that the two organizations removed
the attack target and their respective exclusive RAT, the two have very Strong relevance.
They are all familiar with Arabic and have been working on Android and Windows
platforms for several years. They are good at puddle attacks.
A variety of RATs are used, most of which are used by both parties.
Both organizations used C&C on the same network segment for two time periods.

Seven, summary
With the geopolitical conflicts and other issues, the parties tried to take the lead through
network intelligence and cyberattack activities, further causing the cyberspace conflict to
intensify. The racquet bear organization is another spy intelligence activity organization
based on this. Without the peace factor, the attack cannot be stopped. Recent reports claim
that an armed group in a certain country in the Middle East has been attacked and declared
dead. This may mean that the attack on the racquet bear organization will change, and
finally hope that peace will last long!
