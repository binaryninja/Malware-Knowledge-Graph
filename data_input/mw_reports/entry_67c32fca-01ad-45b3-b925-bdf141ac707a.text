OPERATION HANGOVER |Executive Summary

Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure
This report details a sophisticated cyberattack infrastructure that appears to originate from India,
conducted by private threat actors with no evidence of state-sponsorship. It has likely been in
operation for over three years, primarily as a platform for surveillance against targets of national
security interest that are mostly based in Pakistan and possibly in the United States. It is also
used for industrial espionage against the Norwegian telecom corporation Telenor and other civilian corporations. Evidence points to professional project management and outsourcing of key
tasks, including some by freelance programmers.
On March 17, 2013 a Norwegian newspaper reported that the country’s telecommunications giant
Telenor had filed a criminal police case for an unlawful computer intrusion. Spear phishing
emails targeting upper management appeared to be the source of the infection
Through extensive analysis, security analysts at Norman Shark in conjunction with our partners,
quickly uncovered a previously unknown and sophisticated infrastructure for targeted attacks.

HangOver Report Executive Summary 4/25/2013

Cyberattack Objectives
The primary purpose of this long-running, global command-and-control network appears to be surveillance against national security interests. Privatesector industrial espionage in fields as diverse as natural resources, telecommunications, law, food & restaurants, and manufacturing is likely a secondary purpose of this network.
Target Selection
Based on analysis of IP addresses collected from criminal data stores discovered during the investigation, it appears that potential victims have been targeted in over a dozen countries, most heavily represented by Pakistan, Iran, and the
United States. Targets include government, military, and civilian organizations
Highly-Targeted Social Engineering Tactics
Spear phishing to carefully-selected target individuals was the primary attack
vector identified in the investigation. The attackers went to great lengths to
make the social engineering aspects of the attack appear as credible and applicable as possible.
In many cases, decoy files and websites were used, specifically geared to the
particular sensibilities of regional targets including cultural and religious subject matter. Victims would click on what appeared to be an interesting document, and begin the long-running infection cycle.
Exploit Tools and Techniques
Despite all of the recent media attention on so-called “zero-day” exploits encompassing brand new, never-before-seen attack methods, Operation Hangover
appears to have relied exclusively upon well-known, previously identified vulnerabilities in Java, Word documents, and web browsers.
Favored methods include documents infected with malicious code, along with
direction to malicious websites with names deliberately similar to legitimate
government, entertainment, security related, and commercial sites. Often the
user would be presented with a legitimate document or software download they
were expecting to see, along with an unseen malicious download.
Infrastructure Development
Operation Hangover utilizes a very extensive and sophisticated command-andcontrol infrastructure, likely developed over many months or years by numerous developers. Our investigation revealed evidence of professional project
management practices used to design frameworks, modules, and subcomponents. Individual malware authors were assigned certain tasks, and components were “outsourced” to what appear to be freelance programmers.
Attribution of Responsibility
In recent months, much focus has been on China – including both statesponsored and individual actors – but Operation Hangover contains notable
hallmarks of originating exclusively in India. We base this attribution with a
very high degree of confidence on our extensive analysis of IP addresses, website domain registrations, and text-based identifiers contained within the malicious code itself. All indications point to private syndicates of threat actors
following their own motivations, with no direct evidence of state-sponsorship
by the Indian government or by any other nation.
