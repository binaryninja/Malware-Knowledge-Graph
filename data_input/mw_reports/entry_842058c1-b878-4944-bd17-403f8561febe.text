Mondelez International and Zurich American Insurance reached a settlement late last week
in their multi-year legal battle over the food company’s $100 million claim regarding damage
from the NotPetya cyberattack in 2017.
The insurer had initially refused to cover the damage to Mondelez, which in court documents
attested it lost more than 1,700 servers and 24,000 laptops to the malware. Details of the
final settlement have not been disclosed.
NotPetya was a destructive attack which masqueraded as ransomware, and reportedly
caused more than $10 billion in global damages. While it encrypted its victims’ machines and
left a demand for a ransom payment, it was not actually designed to be decrypted.
The malware used an exploit which allowed the virus to spread automatically through trusted
networks. It had first been introduced into a popular Ukrainian accounting company’s
software but quickly spread beyond Ukraine to hit numerous other countries and companies,
including Mondelez and Merck.
Mondelez, the multinational corporation behind Oreos, Ritz crackers, and dozens of other
snack food brands, did not respond to The Record for comment. A spokesperson for Zurich
Insurance said they could only provide a short statement in response: “The parties have
1/4

mutually resolved the matter.”
The case between the two was complex because Mondelez had not taken out an explicit
cyber insurance policy but a property policy that it argued covered cyberattacks.
Zurich claimed in response that the damage caused by NotPetya was excluded from this
policy on the grounds it was a “hostile or warlike action” conducted by a “government or
sovereign power.”
The settlement will “fuel growth for the cyber insurance market,” according to Billy Gouveia,
the chief executive of incident response business Surefire Cyber.
“As cyber risk remains a top concern for businesses, it is important for organizations to
prepare and protect themselves on all fronts,” he told The Record, referencing a range of
preparations from incident response planning through to insurance.
Craig Dunn, the head of Cyber M&A Insurance EMEA for Aon, told The Record he didn’t
think the settlement was “much of a surprise.”
“In short, the policy was not a cyberinsurance policy — it was a property policy that provided
some cover for cyber events — and Zurich was in a bit of hot water while Mondelez felt like
they were in a fairly strong position.”
Dunn, who previously led Hiscox Europe’s cyberinsurance business, explained that NotPetya
left the whole market feeling the war exclusions included in most policies were not fit for
purpose. Lloyds of London recently led an effort to revamp these exclusions and find some
kind of solution that balanced the needs of the customers and the insurance market.
The exercise involved different insurers and brokers who ultimately came up with four
different exclusions that can be used to reject claims for state-based attacks in different
ways.
“Despite the negative press that Lloyds of London got for some of the exclusions they’ve
come up with, the vast majority of insurers are adopting variants where the intention is to
only exclude nation state attacks that form part of an armed conflict or impact the underlying
functioning of a state. In short, the intention is generally not to exclude something like North
Korea hacking Sony back in 2014,” said Dunn.
While one of the exclusions would not cover incidents like the Sony hack, Dunn said “most
insurers realize this does not meet their clients’ needs and are happy to provide cover for
events that impact individual companies. This important detail was missed by previous
reporting.”

Act of War?

The settlement follows earlier this year a New Jersey court ruling in favor of Merck, which
had sued its insurer, Ace American, for refusing to cover the damages it suffered because of
NotPetya.
In that case, the court dismissed Ace Americans’ defense that the attack was an “Act of War”
and therefore excluded by the insurance contract. Merck’s lawyers successfully argued that
“Acts of War” as defined in the contract referred exclusively to “official state actions,” which
the NotPetya attack did not count as.
The United States and United Kingdom have attributed the NotPetya malware to the Russian
Federation, with the National Cyber Security Centre finding the Russian military was “almost
certainly responsible” — the highest confidence rating the intelligence agency gives. The
Kremlin has repeatedly denied it orchestrated the attack.
NotPetya highlighted the risks that a catastrophic cyberattack could pose for the insurance
industry, which could find itself without the capital to support claims.
“There are a lot of concerns about aggregation of risk. Unlike in property insurance where
insurers can diversify risk by simply ensuring they don’t insure too many homes or
businesses in one geographical region – the same cannot be said of cyber,” explained Dunn.
Part of the problem is a lack of diversity within the technology sector, with so many
businesses using Windows and relying on cloud services provided by a limited number of
vendors, Dunn said, “meaning risk can’t be diversified based on geographical location, so
insurers must be careful not to take on too much risk.”
The four different exclusions which Lloyds had come up with included the concept of an
impact state, where the only losses excluded will be those that are incurred within a war
zone or within the state where the critical national infrastructure has been severely damaged.
“Losses suffered in other countries, where critical national infrastructure (CNI) remains
operational and where no state of war exists, would be covered,” explained Dunn.
“For instance, if a company operating both inside and outside of Ukraine is attacked today by
the Russians and they happened to have this version of the war exclusion in their cyber
insurance policy, then any losses incurred as a result of their IT infrastructure being taken out
inside of Ukraine, which is in a state of war and as such is an ‘impacted state,’ would be
excluded,” he said. “However, if their operations in the U.S. or U.K. are also impacted, any
losses stemming from this would be covered, since the U.S. and U.K. are outside of the war
zone and have not suffered attacks against their CNI.”
