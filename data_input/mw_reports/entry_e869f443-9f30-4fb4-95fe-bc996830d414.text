Cybereason vs. REvil Ransomware: The Kaseya
Chronicles
cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-revil-ransomware-the-kaseya-chronicles

As a spate of ransomware attacks continue to dominate the headlines in recent months, the
infamous REvil ransomware gang has upped the ante significantly with a wide ranging
operation that is suspected to have impacted thousands of small-to-midsize businesses
through the compromise of a leading IT services provider.
Reports indicate that the REvil gang’s supply chain attack exploited the Kaseya VSA remote
management service to propagate the ransomware to multiple targets by way of Managed
Service Providers who use the software to service clients across the globe.
REvil is the same threat actor who hit meatpacking giant JBS with a ransomware attack at
the beginning of June, shutting down a good portion of the company’s production capabilities
and threatened to create supply chain disruptions and sharp cost of goods increases.
Back in April of 2019, the Cybereason Nocturnus team first encountered and analyzed the
REvil ransomware (aka Sodinokibi, Sodin), a notoriously aggressive and highly evasive
threat that takes many measures to maintain obfuscation and prevent detection by security
tools.

Cybereason Detects and Blocks REvil Ransomware

The Cybereason Defense Platform has consistently proven to detect and block REvil
ransomware. Cybereason customers have been protected from this threat since it emerged
in 2019, as are the customers of our Managed Services Provider partners in the wake of the
Kaseya supply chain compromise:

Over time, REvil has become the largest ransomware cartel operating in operation to date.
Subsequent attacks attributed to the REvil gang include a March 2021 attack against
Taiwanese multinational electronics corporation Acer where the assailants demanded a
record breaking $50 million ransom.
In April, the REvil gang attempted to extort Apple following an attack against one of the tech
giant’s business partners with a $50 million ransom demand with the additional threats to
increase the ransom demand to $100 million and release exfiltrated data from the target
should the payment not be made promptly.
Much like the DarkSide ransomware gang that struck Colonial Pipeline in early May, the
REvil gang follows the double extortion trend, where the threat actors first exfiltrates
sensitive information stored on a victim’s systems before launching the encryption routine.
After the ransomware encrypts the target’s data and issues the ransom demand for payment
in exchange for the decryption key, the threat actors make the additional threat of publishing
the exfiltrated data online should the target refuse to make the ransom payment.
This means the target is still faced with the prospect of having to pay the ransom regardless
of whether or not they employed data backups as a precautionary measure, and
underscores the need to take a prevention-first security posture.

REvil’s Kaseya Attack
At the time of publication of this report, the exact chain of events that enabled at least 1000
businesses to be infected by the REvil ransomware is not entirely clear. According to
Huntress’s investigation, one possibility is the exploitation of the web interface of Kaseya’s
VSA Servers (software used by Kaseya customers to monitor and manage their
infrastructure), which enabled authentication bypass and remote code execution.
In addition, The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) has revealed that it had
alerted Kaseya on a number of zero-day vulnerabilities in the VSA software (CVE-202130116) which are used in the ransomware attacks.

The Flow of the Alleged Supply-Chain Attack

Full attack tree as shown in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Once the attackers gain access to the targeted environment, the Kaseya Agent Monitor
(agentmon.exe) is used to write a base 64 decoded file named “agent.crt” (The ransomware
dropper) to the path “c:\kworking\”.

After it writes the encoded payload to disk, agentmon.exe executes the following command
line which contains the following commands:

Ping is executed a random number of times (in each instance we observed the -n
parameter is different). This may function as a sleep timer before the next instructions
are executed:

PowerShell command is executed to disable Windows built-in security and Antivirus
settings on the machine:

“CertUtil.exe” is copied to “C:\Windows\cert.exe”. CertUtil.exe is an admin command
line tool intended by Microsoft to be used for manipulating certification authority (CA)
data and components. CertUtil.exe is popular as a LoLBin (living off the land binaries)
and is often used by attackers. The name change is probably used as an attempt to
evade detection rules for the process. In addition a random number is echoed to the
end of “cert.exe”, probably to change the hash of the file.

Cert.exe (renamed CertUtil.exe) is used to decode the previously dropped “agent.crt” file to
“agent.exe”, which is then executed:

The Ransomware Dropper (agent.exe)
The ransomware dropper (agent.exe) is signed with the certificate “PB03 TRANSPORT
LTD.” The Certificate appears to have only been used by REvil malware that was deployed
during this attack:

To add a layer of stealth, the attackers used a technique called DLL Side-Loading. Agent.exe
drops an outdated version that is vulnerable to DLL Side-Loading of “msmpeng.exe” - the
Windows Defender executable.
The dropper then writes the ransomware payload to disk as the model “mpsvc.dll” to make
“msmpeng.exe” load and execute it:

The Ransomware Payload (mpsvc.dll)
Similar to the agent.exe dropper binary, the ransomware payload DLL is also signed with the
same certificate. Analysis of the DLL binary showed that it is the REVIL ransomware. Once
the execution is passed to the module, it executes the command “netsh advfirewall firewall
set rule group=”Network Discovery” new enable=Yes”, which changes the firewall settings to
allow local windows systems to be discovered. Then, it starts to encrypt the files on the
system, eventually dropping the following ransom note:

CYBEREASON DETECTION AND PREVENTION
Ransomware attacks are on the rise. A recently released report by Cybereason, titled
Ransomware: The True Cost to Business, detailed how malicious actors are fine-tuning their
ransomware campaign tactics, and how both the frequency and severity of successful
ransomware attacks have tremendous impact on victim organizations and their ability to
conduct business.
The full REvil attack involving Kesaya is presented in the Cybereason Defense Platform
process tree as an automatically generated Malop™ for a complete view of the attack
narrative:

Ransomware Prevention Capabilities are Key
The best ransomware defense for organizations is to focus on preventing a ransomware
infection in the first place. Organizations need visibility into the more subtle Indicators of
Behavior (IOBs) that allow detection and prevention of a ransomware attack at the earliest
stages.
Cybereason delivers industry leading ransomware protection via multi-layered prevention,
detection and response, including:
Anti Ransomware Prevention and Deception: Cybereason uses a combination of
behavioral detections and proprietary deception techniques surface the most complex
ransomware threats and end the attack before any critical data can be encrypted.
Intelligence-Based Antivirus: Cybereason blocks known ransomware variants
leveraging an ever-growing pool of threat intelligence based on previously detected
attacks.
NGAV: Cybereason NGAV is powered by machine learning and recognizes malicious
components in code to block unknown ransomware variants prior to execution.
Fileless Ransomware Protection: Cybereason disrupts attacks utilizing fileless and
MBR-based ransomware that traditional antivirus tools miss.
Endpoint Controls: Cybereason hardens endpoints against attacks by managing
security policies, maintaining device controls, implementing personal firewalls and
enforcing whole-disk encryption across a range of device types, both fixed and mobile.
