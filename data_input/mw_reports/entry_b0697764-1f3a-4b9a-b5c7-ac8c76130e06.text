Summary
Immediate Actions WWS Facilities Can Take Now to Protect Against Malicious Cyber
Activity
• Do not click on suspicious links.
• If you use RDP, secure and monitor it.
• Use strong passwords.
• Use multi-factor authentication.
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common
Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework, version 9. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all
referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
This joint advisory is the result of analytic efforts between the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), and the National Security Agency (NSA) to highlight ongoing malicious cyber
activity—by both known and unknown actors—targeting the information technology (IT) and
operational technology (OT) networks, systems, and devices of U.S. Water and Wastewater
Systems (WWS) Sector facilities. This activity—which includes attempts to compromise
system integrity via unauthorized access—threatens the ability of WWS facilities to provide
clean, potable water to, and effectively manage the wastewater of, their communities.
Note: although cyber threats across critical infrastructure sectors are increasing, this
advisory does not intend to indicate greater targeting of the WWS Sector versus others.
To secure WWS facilities—including Department of Defense (DoD) water treatment facilities
in the United States and abroad—against the TTPs listed below, CISA, FBI, EPA, and NSA
strongly urge organizations to implement the measures described in the Recommended
Mitigations section of this advisory.

Technical Details
Threat Overview
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

1/8

WWS facilities may be vulnerable to the following common tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors to compromise IT and OT networks, systems, and
devices.
Spearphishing personnel to deliver malicious payloads, including ransomware [T1566].
Spearphishing is one of the most prevalent techniques used for initial access to
IT networks. Personnel and their potential lack of cyber awareness are a
vulnerability within an organization. Personnel may open malicious attachments
or links to execute malicious payloads contained in emails from threat actors that
have successfully bypassed email filtering controls.
When organizations integrate IT with OT systems, attackers can gain access—
either purposefully or inadvertently—to OT assets after the IT network has been
compromised through spearphishing and other techniques.
Exploitation of internet-connected services and applications that enable remote
access to WWS networks [T1210].
For example, threat actors can exploit a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
that is insecurely connected to the internet to infect a network with
ransomware. If the RDP is used for process control equipment, the attacker
could also compromise WWS operations. Note: the increased use of remote
operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic has likely increased the
prevalence of weaknesses associated with remote access.
Exploitation of unsupported or outdated operating systems and software.
Threat actors likely seek to take advantage of perceived weaknesses among
organizations that either do not have—or choose not to prioritize—resources for
IT/OT infrastructure modernization. WWS facilities tend to allocate resources to
physical infrastructure in need of replacement or repair (e.g., pipes) rather than
IT/OT infrastructure.
The fact that WWS facilities are inconsistently resourced municipal systems—not
all of which have the resources to employ consistently high cybersecurity
standards—may contribute to the use of unsupported or outdated operating
systems and software.
Exploitation of control system devices with vulnerable firmware versions.
WWS systems commonly use outdated control system devices or firmware
versions, which expose WWS networks to publicly accessible and remotely
executable vulnerabilities. Successful compromise of these devices may lead to
loss of system control, denial of service, or loss of sensitive data [T0827].
WWS Sector Cyber Intrusions
Cyber intrusions targeting U.S. WWS facilities highlight vulnerabilities associated with the
following threats:
Insider threats, from current or former employees who maintain improperly active
credentials
2/8

Ransomware attacks
WWS Sector cyber intrusions from 2019 to early 2021 include:
In August 2021, malicious cyber actors used Ghost variant ransomware against a
California-based WWS facility. The ransomware variant had been in the system for
about a month and was discovered when three supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) servers displayed a ransomware message.
In July 2021, cyber actors used remote access to introduce ZuCaNo ransomware onto
a Maine-based WWS facility’s wastewater SCADA computer. The treatment system
was run manually until the SCADA computer was restored using local control and more
frequent operator rounds.
In March 2021, cyber actors used an unknown ransomware variant against a Nevadabased WWS facility. The ransomware affected the victim’s SCADA system and backup
systems. The SCADA system provides visibility and monitoring but is not a full
industrial control system (ICS).
In September 2020, personnel at a New Jersey-based WWS facility discovered
potential Makop ransomware had compromised files within their system.
In March 2019, a former employee at Kansas-based WWS facility unsuccessfully
attempted to threaten drinking water safety by using his user credentials, which had not
been revoked at the time of his resignation, to remotely access a facility computer.

Mitigations
The FBI, CISA, EPA, and NSA recommend WWS facilities—including DoD water treatment
facilities in the United States and abroad—use a risk-informed analysis to determine the
applicability of a range of technical and non-technical mitigations to prevent, detect, and
respond to cyber threats.
WWS Monitoring
Personnel responsible for monitoring WWS should check for the following suspicious
activities and indicators, which may be indicative of threat actor activity:
Inability of WWS facility personnel to access SCADA system controls at any time,
either entirely or in part;
Unfamiliar data windows or system alerts appearing on SCADA system controls and
facility data screens that could indicate a ransomware attack;
Detection by SCADA system controls, or by water treatment personnel, of abnormal
operating parameters—such as unusually high chemical addition rates—used in the
safe and proper treatment of drinking water;
Access of SCADA systems by unauthorized individuals or groups, e.g., former
employees and current employees not authorized/assigned to operate SCADA systems
and controls.

3/8

Access of SCADA systems at unusual times, which may indicate that a legitimate
user’s credentials have been compromised
Unexplained SCADA system restarts.
Unchanging parameter values that normally fluctuate.
Remote Access Mitigations
Note: The increased use of remote operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic increases the
necessity for asset owner-operators to assess the risk associated with enhanced remote
access to ensure it falls within acceptable levels.
Require multi-factor authentication for all remote access to the OT network, including
from the IT network and external networks.
Utilize blocklisting and allowlisting to limit remote access to users with a verified
business and/or operational need.
Ensure that all remote access technologies have logging enabled and regularly audit
these logs to identify instances of unauthorized access.
Utilize manual start and stop features in place of always activated unattended access
to reduce the time remote access services are running.
Audit networks for systems using remote access services.
Close unneeded network ports associated with remote access services (e.g.,
RDP – Transmission Control Protocol [TCP] Port 3389).
When configuring access control for a host, utilize custom settings to limit the access a
remote party can attempt to acquire.
Network Mitigations
Implement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and OT networks to
limit the ability of malicious cyber actors to pivot to the OT network after compromising
the IT network.
Implement demilitarized zones (DMZs), firewalls, jump servers, and one-way
communication diodes to prevent unregulated communication between the IT and
OT networks.
Develop/update network maps to ensure a full accounting of all equipment that is
connected to the network.
Remove any equipment from networks that is not required to conduct operations
to reduce the attack surface malicious actors can exploit.
Planning and Operational Mitigations

4/8

Ensure the organization’s emergency response plan considers the full range of
potential impacts that cyberattacks pose to operations, including loss or manipulation of
view, loss or manipulation of control, and threats to safety.
The plan should also consider third parties with legitimate need for OT network
access, including engineers and vendors.
Review, test, and update the emergency response plan on an annual basis to
ensure accuracy.
Exercise the ability to fail over to alternate control systems, including manual operation
while assuming degraded electronic communications.
Allow employees to gain decision-making experience via tabletop exercises that
incorporate loss of visibility and control scenarios. Utilize resources such as the
Environment Protection Agency’s (EPA) Cybersecurity Incident Action Checklist as well
as the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information
Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.
Safety System Mitigations
Install independent cyber-physical safety systems. These are systems that physically
prevent dangerous conditions from occurring if the control system is compromised by a
threat actor.
Examples of cyber-physical safety system controls include:
Size of the chemical feed pump
Gearing on valves
Pressure switches, etc.
These types of controls benefit WWS Sector facilities—especially smaller
facilities with limited cybersecurity capability—because they enable facility staff to
assess systems from a worst-case scenario and determine protective solutions.
Enabling cyber-physical safety systems allows operators to take physical steps to
limit the damage, for example, by preventing cyber actors, who have gained
control of a sodium hydroxide pump, from raising the pH to dangerous levels.

Additional Mitigations
Foster an organizational culture of cyber readiness. See the CISA Cyber Essentials
along with the items listed in the Resources section below for guidance.
Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT
network assets. Use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which OT network
assets and zones should participate in the patch management program. Consider
using a centralized patch management system.
Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets
using up-to-date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine
how OT network assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.

5/8

Implement regular data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks.
Regularly test backups.
Ensure backups are not connected to the network to prevent the potential spread
of ransomware to the backups.
When possible, enable OT device authentication, utilize the encrypted version of OT
protocols, and encrypt all wireless communications to ensure the confidentiality and
authenticity of process control data in transit.
Employ user account management to:
Remove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible.
Implement account lockout policies to reduce risk from brute-force attacks.
Monitor the creation of administrator-level accounts by third-party vendors with
robust and privileged account management policies and procedures.
Implement a user account policy that includes set durations for deactivation and
removal of accounts after employees leave the organization or after accounts
reach a defined period of inactivity.
Implement data execution prevention controls, such as application allowlisting and
software restriction policies that prevent programs from executing from common
ransomware locations, such as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers.
Train users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and
social engineering attempts. Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual
activity.
