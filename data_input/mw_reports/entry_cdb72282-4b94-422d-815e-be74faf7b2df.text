A new multi-platform backdoor malware named 'SysJoker' has emerged in the wild,
targeting Windows, Linux, and macOS with the ability to evade detection on all three
operating systems.
The discovery of the new malware comes from researchers at Intezer who first saw signs of
its activity in December 2021 after investigating an attack on a Linux-based web server.
The first uploads of the malware sample on VirusTotal occurred in H2 2021, which also
aligns with the C2 domain registration times.
The security analysts have now published a detailed technical report on SysJoker, which
they shared with Bleeping Computer before publication.

The malware is written in C++, and while each variant is tailored for the targeted operating
system, they are all undetected on VirusTotal, an online malware scanning site that uses 57
different antivirus detection engines.
On Windows, SysJoker employs a first-stage dropper in the form of a DLL, which uses
PowerShell commands to do the following:
fetch the SysJoker ZIP from a GitHub repository,
unzip it on "C:\ProgramData\RecoverySystem\”,
execute the payload.
The malware then sleeps for up to two minutes before creating a new directory and copies
itself as an Intel Graphics Common User Interface Service ("igfxCUIService.exe”).

"Next, SysJoker will gather information about the machine using Living off the Land (LOtL)
commands. SysJoker uses different temporary text files to log the results of the
commands,” explains Intezer’s report.
"These text files are deleted immediately, stored in a JSON object and then encoded and
written to a file named "microsoft_Windows.dll”.”
After gathering system and network data, the malware will create persistence by adding a
new registry key
(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run). Random
sleep times are interposed between all functions leading to this point.

The next step for the malware is to reach out to the actor-controlled C2 server, and for this,
it uses a hardcoded Google Drive link.

The link hosts a "domain.txt” file that the actors regularly update to provide available servers
to live beacons. This list constantly changes to avoid detection and blocking.
The system information collected in the first stages of the infection is sent as the first
handshake to the C2. The C2 replies with a unique token that serves as the identifier of the
infected endpoint.
From there, the C2 may instruct the backdoor to install additional malware, run commands
on the infected device, or command the backdoor to remove itself from the device. Those
last two instructions haven't been implemented yet, though.

While the Linux and macOS variants do not have a first-stage dropper in the form of a DLL,
they ultimately perform the same malicious behavior on the infected device.

Detection and prevention
Intezer has provided full indicators of compromise (IOCs) in their report that admins can use
to detect the presence of SysJoker on an infected device.
Below, we have outlined some of the IOCs for each operating system.
On Windows, the malware files are located under the "C:\ProgramData\RecoverySystem"
folder, at C:\ProgramData\SystemData\igfxCUIService.exe,
and C:\ProgramData\SystemData\microsoft_Windows.dll. For persistence, the malware
creates an Autorun "Run" value of "igfxCUIService" that launches the igfxCUIService.exe
malware executable.
On Linux, the files and directories are created under "/.Library/” while persistence is
established by creating the following cron job: @reboot
(/.Library/SystemServices/updateSystem).
On macOS, the files are created on "/Library/” and persistence is achieved via
LaunchAgent under the path: /Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.update.plist.

If you found that you have been compromised by SysJoker, follow these three steps:
1. Kill all processes related to the malware and manually delete the files and the relevant
persistence mechanism.
2. Run a memory scanner to ensure that all malicious files have been uprooted from the
infected system.
3. Investigate the potential entry points, check firewall configurations, and update all
software tools to the latest available version.
