Immortal information stealer
zscaler.com/blogs/research/immortal-information-stealer

Recently, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team came across new information-stealer malware
called Immortal, which is written in .NET and designed to steal sensitive information from an
infected machine. The Immortal stealer is sold on the dark web with different build-based
subscriptions. This blog provides an analysis of the data Immortal steals from browsers, the
files it steals (and the applications it steals from), and what it does with the stolen data.
Immortal starts its infection by creating a directory with a random name in a temp folder.
Next, it creates a password.log file in "\%Temp%\{Random_DirName}\password.log”.

Immortal writes the malware name, author’s name, and telegram address of the author in a
password.log file.

Browser info stealing
1/10

Immortal steals data from 24 browsers. It steals stored credentials, cookies, credit card
data, and autofill data from the targeted browsers.
When the user saves a username and password in the targeted browser, it stores the data
in a “Login Data” file in an SQLite database format, and the browser-stored cookie
information in the “Cookies” file. It also stores autofill data, credit card data, and other web
information in the “Web Data” file. Below are the file paths for those files:
“\%AppData%\Local\{Browser}\User Data\Default\Login Data”
“\%AppData%\Local\{Browser}\User Data\Default\Web Data”
“\%AppData%\Local\{Browser}\User Data\Default\Cookies”
List of targeted browsers:

Autofill data
The autofill feature of a browser allows the user to store commonly entered information in
web forms. This information might include username, email, password, address, and credit
card information. So, when the user opens a web page, it will automatically fill in the
information already saved by the browser. The autofill information is stored in the “Web
Data” file.
Immortal fetches autofill data from the “Web Data” file and stores it in the {Autofill}_CC.txt
file.
Path: “\%AppData%\{Random_DirName}\Autofill\{Browsername_Autofill.txt}”. The format is
shown below.

The malware stores all the stolen data in the directory “\%Temp%\{Random_DirName}\”.
After that, it compresses all the files in a ZIP archive and saves the compressed file in
\%Temp%\{Random_filename}.zip. Further, it sends {Random_filename}.zip to its
command-and-control server as shown below. It also deletes the “\%Temp%\
{Random_DirName}\” before sending the ZIP file.
