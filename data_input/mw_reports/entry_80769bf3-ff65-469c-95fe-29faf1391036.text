INTRODUCTION

1.1

Purpose and Scope

This report provides an overview and summary analysis of on-site assessments conducted by
the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) in Fiscal Year
2014.
ICS-CERT is a component of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration
Center (NCCIC), a division with the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of
Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C).
ICS-CERT’s mission is to reduce risk to the Nation’s critical infrastructure by
strengthening control systems security and resilience through public-private partnerships.
As a core part of its mission, ICS-CERT offers a range of cybersecurity assessment products
and services at no cost to critical infrastructure owners and operators. Through a comprehensive
voluntary public-private partnership, ICS-CERT works with critical infrastructure owners and
operators, industrial control systems vendors, integrators, Sector-Specific Agencies, other
Federal departments and agencies, State, Local, Tribal, Territorial (SLTT) governments,
international partners, and others to assess various aspects of critical infrastructure pertinent to
the control systems risk environment. Cybersecurity assessments help DHS and public and
private sector stakeholders to understand ICS risks and implement policies, standards, and
actions to mitigate that risk. This report contains the following core elements:
•

An overview of ICS-CERT’s Assessment Program, including a description of the assessment
products and services ICS-CERT provides.

•

Quantitative and qualitative summaries of assessment types, geographic location, and critical
infrastructure sectors assessed in FY 2014.

•

Assessment findings for FY 2014, including common ICS vulnerabilities and cybersecurity
weaknesses.

•

Guidance to assist critical infrastructure owners and operators in reducing cyber risk and
enhancing industrial control systems security.

•

Information for stakeholders interested in requesting an assessment and learning more about
ICS-CERT and its programs.

Background

DHS established the Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) in 2003 to help secure the
Nation’s critical infrastructure against cybersecurity threats to industrial control systems. In
2012, ICS-CERT replaced the CSSP as part of a functional realignment of CS&C. ICS-CERT
works through voluntary partnerships with a broad range of government, private-sector, and
other stakeholders to provide a range of products, services, and capabilities that improve national
capacity to detect, analyze, and mitigate cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities to industrial
control systems and to better respond to cybersecurity incidents.
The United States depends on critical infrastructure (CI) 1 to support national defense, public
health and safety, economic vitality, and overarching societal well-being. Disruptions or
significant damage to CI could result in potentially catastrophic and cascading consequences to
the Nation.
Although CI sectors differ greatly, many share a common characteristic: a dependence on
ICS for process automation and safety. Common ICS examples include Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), and Process Control
Systems (PCS). These systems control, monitor, and manage vital functions that support critical
infrastructure, such as subway systems, dams, water treatment facilities, energy pipelines,
chemical manufacturing plants, nuclear power plants, electric power generators, and
telecommunications networks.
Traditionally, most control systems were purpose-built, stand-alone systems. Over time,
however, the convergence of physical and cyber business processes and systems led to the
integration of control systems networks with corporate enterprise networks as well as wireless,
mobile, and cloud-based applications that support remote access and other capabilities. While
improving efficiency and functionality, this integration also creates the potential for malicious
cyber exploitation of what were traditionally stand-alone proprietary systems.
A successful cyber-attack on a control system could result in significant physical damage,
loss of life, and cascading effects that could disrupt or destroy critical infrastructure at a local,
regional, and even national level. In addition, significant cyberattacks could also undermine
public confidence in the safety, security, and reliability of critical infrastructure.

1

Critical infrastructure is defined as “… systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or
destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety,
or any combination of those matters.” Presidential Policy Directive-21: Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience identifies 16 critical
infrastructure sectors: https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/presidential-policy-directive-critical-infrastructure-security-andresil

1.3

ICS-CERT’s Assessment Program

The first step in protecting industrial control systems from harm is to understand the
cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and overarching cyber risk that critical infrastructure
stakeholders face. DHS formally developed its control systems assessment program in 2009 to
help CI asset owners and operators identify potential weaknesses in their ICS networks and to
provide guidance for hardening those systems against cyber threats. ICS-CERT works with CI
partners to review, verify, and provide recommendations for enhancing the protective and
detective controls, policies, and procedural elements of their cybersecurity framework. ICSCERT offers cybersecurity assessments of industrial control systems for companies, entities, and
asset owner-operators across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors.
ICS-CERT assessments help critical infrastructure owners and operators do the following:
•

Identify potential weaknesses or gaps within their ICS network.

•

Understand cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.

•

Establish a baseline security posture.

•

Pursue risk mitigation options, as appropriate.

Requesting a Cybersecurity Assessment
ICS-CERT assessments are available at no cost to critical infrastructure asset owners and operators.
Following completion of DAR and NAVV assessments, ICS-CERT compiles an in-depth report for
the asset owner, including analysis of key discoveries and practical mitigation options for enhancing
ICS cyber security.
Information shared with ICS-CERT can be protected by DHS as Protected Critical Infrastructure
Information (PCII).
To schedule an assessment, please contact ICS-CERT at icsassessments@hq.dhs.gov.

ICS-CERT ONSITE ASSESSMENTS: OVERVIEW

ICS-CERT offers both self-assessment and facilitated onsite assessment products and
services at no cost to CI owners and operators. ICS-CERT provides three primary assessment
services:
•

Cybersecurity Evaluation using the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET®).

•

Design Architecture Review (DAR).

•

Network Architecture Validation and Verification (NAVV).

ICS-CERT performs onsite assessments at the request of critical infrastructure asset owners
and other entities. ICS-CERT tailors service offerings to the needs, size, and sophistication of
asset owners. The types of organizations for which ICS-CERT conducts assessments vary
greatly, ranging from small entities that have never completed an evaluation and review of their
control system operations (from a cybersecurity perspective) to larger entities subject to strong
regulation. ICS-CERT aligns its service offerings to asset owner requirements (e.g., level of
detail and depth of evaluation the asset owner requests) as well as factors such as the risk profile
of the organization, the current threat landscape, and known adversarial activity against specific
entities or sectors.

2.1

ICS-CERT Assessment Types

ICS-CERT uses the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Recommended Security
Controls for Federal Information Systems (NIST 800-53) as a structured method to group and
analyze vulnerabilities discovered during assessments. The NIST 800-53 control family
mappings provide a consistent and repeatable methodology for collecting and correlating data to
analyze and trend key discoveries at a holistic level. Data collected during these assessments is
used for reporting and trending, and helps ICS-CERT to continually refine its assessment
services. Appendix A, “NIST 800-53 Security Control Family Descriptions” lists NIST 800-53
control categories.
NIST Special Publication 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, 2
implements an industrial control systems overlay to NIST 800-53, tailoring security guidance to
the unique operational and system characteristics of industrial control systems. While NIST 80082 applies generally to all critical infrastructure sector control systems, ICS-CERT can work
with sector stakeholders to provide additional tailoring to unique aspects of the individual
sectors, as necessary.

2

Special publication 800-82, Revision 2 (Draft) Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security is a document revision out
for public comment at the time of this report, however, the guidance is being actively utilized and evaluated by the ICS-CERT
Site Assessment team.

2.2

Cyber Security Evaluation Tool Assessments

ICS-CERT developed and maintains CSET, a software tool used to conduct cybersecurity
assessments. DHS developed CSET to provide a snapshot of an organization’s cybersecurity
posture. CSET maps evaluation outputs to cybersecurity standards and best practices 3. In FY
2014, ICS-CERT conducted 48 facilitated CSET assessments in partnership with various critical
infrastructure stakeholders, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. FY 2014 CSET Assessments by State.
Using CSET software, ICS-CERT provides on-site facilitated cybersecurity assessments as
the introductory assessment within ICS-CERT’s portfolio, but they are not a prerequisite for
more in-depth assessments. CSET assessments typically take one day to complete (per control
system architecture). While CSET is also available to asset owners as a downloadable selfassessment tool that can be used without the assistance of ICS-CERT, the onsite facilitated
assessment provides a learning opportunity for asset owners to understand how to most
effectively use the tool on a repeatable and continuous basis.
Figure 2 shows the high-level process that CSET assessments follow. The asset owner works
with the ICS-CERT assessment team to conduct a discovery-oriented evaluation of the entity’s
underlying control processes, procedures, policies, methodologies, and protective and detective
security controls. These compose the cybersecurity foundation for ensuring the availability and
integrity of the control process.
3

For example, NIST 800 SP82, NIST 800 SP53, Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and the Critical Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee.

2.3

Design Architecture Review

A Design Architecture Review (DAR) entails a deep-dive assessment and analysis of the
operational process, focusing on the underlying ICS network architecture, integration of
Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) teams, vendor support,
monitoring, cyber security controls, and a review of all internal and external connections utilized
within the control systems environment. The DAR focuses heavily on three key areas:
•

ICS Network Architecture.

•

Asset Inventory.

•

Protective and Detective Security controls.

This type of assessment generally takes two days to complete (per control system
architecture). ICS-CERT can conduct DARs independently of or in conjunction with CSET
assessments. A DAR includes a comprehensive evaluation and discovery process, focusing on
defense-in-depth strategies associated with an asset owner’s specific control systems network. A
DAR provides the asset owner with a thorough evaluation of system interdependencies,
vulnerabilities, and mitigation options. It examines information related to key ICS external
connections and includes an in-depth review of control systems design documents, drawings, and
architectures.

DAR and NAVV Evaluation Benchmarks
ICS-CERT uses the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Recommended Security
Controls for Federal Information Systems (NIST 800-53) as a structured method to group and analyze
vulnerabilities found during DAR and NAVV assessments.
The NIST 800-53 control family mappings provide a consistent and repeatable methodology for
collecting and correlating data to analyze and trend key discoveries at a holistic level. Data collected
during these assessments is used for reporting and trending, and helps ICS-CERT to continually refine
its assessment services.

2.4

Network Architecture Validation and Verification

The Network Architecture Validation and Verification (NAVV) assessment entails the
analysis of network traffic (passively captured) occurring within the ICS network. Using a
combination of both open-source and commercially available tools, ICS-CERT is able to
strategically visualize and present the network traffic and device-to-device communications
occurring within various ICS network segments.
The tools ICS-CERT utilizes also include relevant threat data and indicators, for which
collected network traffic can be reviewed and verified. NAVV assessments enable asset owners
to do the following:
• Verify the accuracy of ICS network diagrams.
• Identify potentially rogue/misconfigured devices or malicious data communications.
• Analyze data flows to ensure that boundary protection devices work as designed.
• Identify opportunities or areas to improve zoning and perimeter protections.
• Baseline the ICS network (including a protocol hierarchy and organization of network
traffic).
• Gain practical knowledge of how to passively monitor and verify the communications
occurring within their ICS networks.
The NAVV provides organizations with an accurate and comprehensive view of network
communication occurring within the ICS network infrastructure, in addition to those
communications sourced from or destined to ICS network segments. ICS-CERT typically
provides NAVV reviews as an extension to DARs, although this service is also offered
independently. In FY 2014, ICS-CERT conducted 56 DAR and NAVV assessments, as shown in
Figure 3.

Figure 3. FY 2014 DAR and NAVV Assessments by State.

FY 2014 ASSESSMENT PROGRAM ACTIVITY & FINDINGS

At the request of its partners, ICS-CERT performed a total of 104 assessments in FY 2014, as
shown in Figure 4. ICS-CERT’s stakeholders drive the demand for cybersecurity assessments.

Figure 4. FY 2014 Total Assessments by State.
ICS-CERT’s partners participate in ICS cybersecurity assessments on a voluntary basis, and
stakeholder requests—along with factors such as sector risk profile, specific threat information,
the dependence of specific critical infrastructure sectors on control systems, etc.—focus ICSCERT’s assessment activity. For example, in FY14, ICS-CERT and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Office of Energy Infrastructure Security (OEIS) 4 introduced a
new technical assessment service offering. This offering provided select Energy Sector asset
owners and operators with proactive and customized cyber security assessment services based
upon their specific interest and areas of focus. As part of that engagement, various Energy Sector
entities requested multiple assessment services, resulting in a comparatively high number of
assessments conducted for that sector in 2014. The number of assessments in any given sector
will fluctuate from year to year, based on the current threat landscape and other factors. Figure 5,
on the next page, provides a percentage breakout of FY 2014 DAR and NAVV assessments by
critical infrastructure sector.

FERC OEIS is non-regulatory and its mission does not include compliance or enforcement actions.

Figure 5. Number of FY 2014 DAR and NAVV Assessments Conducted by CI Sector.
DAR and NAVV assessments form the basis for identifying common vulnerabilities as they
offer the most comprehensive evaluation of an organization’s cybersecurity posture. In addition,
ICS-CERT does not collect or retain data from CSET assessments (asset owners alone retain this
data). DAR and NAVV assessments use NIST 800-53 security control families (see Appendix A,
“NIST 800-53 Security Control Family Descriptions”) as the evaluation benchmark. Table 1 lists
the top-level NIST 800-53 Security Control Families; each control family also contains subcategories. 5

In FY 2014, ICS-CERT conducted 56 DAR and NAVV assessments (35 DARs and 21
NAVVs) in multiple critical infrastructure sectors. While ICS-CERT’s assessments identified
weaknesses across all control families, Table 2 shows that six vulnerabilities were most
prevalent, representing approximately 28% of the total vulnerabilities discovered across assessed
critical infrastructure sectors. Figure 6 shows the distribution of discovered vulnerabilities,
mapped to sub-categories within NIST 800-53 Security Control Families.

Figure 6. Identified Weaknesses by Security Control Family Sub-Category
ICS-CERT assessments most frequently found Boundary Protection, Information Flow
Enforcement, and Remote Access vulnerabilities. Table 2, below, summarizes the six most
common vulnerabilities by Security Control Family, sub-category weakness, and potential risk.
Section 4 describes recommended mitigation activities and best practices for each of these
common vulnerabilities.

Risk

Boundary
Protection

• Without adequate boundary protections for the ICS network, it becomes very difficult
to detect potentially malicious or nefarious activity. In addition, the lack of boundary
protection provides various vectors for interfacing with devices and systems which
directly support the control process.
• The scope of threats and general risk to control systems operations increases
significantly without logical separation of the ICS network from a traditional
enterprise network (or from untrusted systems like the internet).

Information
Flow
Enforcement

• Without a comprehensive understanding and visibility of network traffic both within
the ICS network and traffic sourced and/or destined to/from the ICS network,
potential nefarious or malicious communications will likely go unnoticed, until an
incident occurs.
• Adversaries establish unauthorized or malicious data communications through the
use of available ports, services, and communications channels (conduits). It is critical
for asset owners to consider detection and monitoring capabilities for activity
occurring within the ICS network in addition to enforcing robust user authentication
protocols, strong password protection on ICS devices, and oversight for restricting
the usage of non-dedicated mobile devices for interfacing with the ICS (e.g., laptops
utilized on corporate or internet-accessible network segments).

Remote
Access

• Remote access is a common attack vector for interfacing with control systems. Weak
remote access security controls introduce many avenues for interfacing with critical
components and control system devices – possibly undetected by an organization.
• Attack vectors can include internet facing devices, third party vendors or contractors
whom have a direct connection to the ICS, weak virtual private network (VPN)
configurations, the use of personal computing devices, and the exploitation of
vulnerable Operating System services and configurations.

Access Control
(AC)

Least
Privilege

• An attacker or malicious insider can leverage user and computer accounts in trusted
domains (or network segments) to potentially interface with the ICS.
• Assigning elevated or enhanced privileges to personnel (above and beyond what they
may require for their daily job functions) introduces many risks, and provides a
means for either intentional (malicious insider/outsider) or unintentional (accidental)
consequences.
• Personnel utilizing elevated privileges and administrative accounts for daily job
functions increases risk, which could ultimately impact operations. Common
vulnerabilities associated with allowing unnecessary privileges include the
installation of unapproved or untested software, the successful execution of malware
or a malicious application on a critical asset, disabling security features and controls
(A/V, host-based firewall), or modifying application permissions or configuration
settings.

Physical and
Environmental
Protection (PE)

Physical
Access
Control

• Direct physical access to control system equipment (by either an outsider or a
malicious insider) can allow an attacker easier access to ICS assets allowing direct
manipulation (via a human-machine interface (HMI) station), reprogramming, or
tampering with field controller equipment.

Security

Isolation

• Flat network architectures minimize the complexity required for successful
exploitation or unauthorized access to the ICS.
• Without appropriate boundary protections, multiple layers of authentication, and
security controls, adversaries could utilize accounts and systems within the corporate
(or trusted third-party) environments as a vector for downstream access to control
system components.
• In addition, flat architectures do not provide an inherent means to readily monitor and
detect nefarious activity between systems and devices.

Recommended Mitigation Strategies and Best Practices

As the threat landscape evolves, and actors continue to develop new tools and techniques to
find and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, it is imperative that ICS users implement a secure and
robust architecture to support the availability and integrity of process automation and operations.
The cyber security risks that organizations face decrease significantly with a strong ICS
architectural framework that includes both protective and detective cybersecurity controls,
implemented at multiple layers. Similarly, a robust architecture improves the organization’s
capability to adequately detect and defend against potential threats and exploits. The common
vulnerabilities identified in Section 3 represent significant weaknesses that asset owners should
understand and know how to mitigate. To assist critical infrastructure owners and operators, ICSCERT offers the mitigation strategies and best practices described below.

3.2

Systems and Communications Protection

Without a comprehensive asset inventory of the devices and systems that directly support the
OT environment, it can be difficult to establish a cyber-boundary and enforce protective and
detective measures. To establish a sound defensive boundary and ensure the proper scope of
security controls required to support operations, asset owners should conduct, document, and
maintain a thorough asset inventory. The inventory should include the following:
•

All ICS components, including all software and hardware

•

Networking and communications system components

•

Dependent systems and applications utilized in support of the process automation. These
include, for example, domain controllers, backup servers, logging and auditing platforms,
and alerting mechanisms.

To comprehensively incorporate cybersecurity within the OT architecture, asset owners
should establish zones of protection around ICS systems. This requires a thorough understanding
of network communications and system dependencies, based upon the operational requirements
associated with the automated process. Understanding the nature of communication flows—
including operational ingress/egress points—and protocol hierarchy helps define the logical
boundary. It is also imperative to fully understand and define the range of ports and services
required for the systems within the ICS environment, as these delineations are necessary for
enforcing proper zoning. Without completing this analysis and understanding the required
intercommunications at the design onset, existing security and segmentation controls (for
example, firewalls, virtual local area networks [VLAN], and access-control lists) can quickly
become ineffective, particularly if network paths must be continually opened and modified
between devices and network segments.
Applying Control Systems Specific Standards
NIST Special Publication 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, implements an
industrial control systems overlay to NIST 800-53, tailoring security guidance to the unique operational
and system characteristics of industrial control systems.
While NIST 800-82 applies generally to control systems in all critical infrastructure sectors, ICSCERT can work with sector stakeholders to provide additional tailoring to the unique aspects of
individual sectors, as necessary.

14

Once asset owners identify and verify the scope of required communication flows, the design
of the infrastructure should support both virtual and logical separation of the ICS network, on
physically separate devices from the enterprise/corporate network. Communications to and from
the ICS network, and communications sourced from and/or destined to an untrusted network
(e.g., the enterprise network), should traverse an intermediary demilitarized zone (DMZ) or
perimeter network. The organization should create a defined perimeter, with specific ingress and
egress points for data flows and “choke points” for enforcing monitoring and protective controls
for data flows traversing from one zone to another. For additional information pertaining to
designing ICS architectures, reference NIST 800-82 (Section 5 – Network Architecture). 6
Proper segmentation must also include any safety and protective systems if they are
accessible via a cyber-mechanism or network-based conduit. These systems are the last line of
defense for an industrial process and should be further isolated from the cyber communication
channels that govern the ICS (or other systems) using best practice boundary protections and
isolation.
Perhaps most importantly, people are a key foundational element for enforcing, managing,
monitoring, tuning, responding, and continually adapting and validating cyber security controls
and practices employed throughout the enterprise. The design for automated control systems is
highly dependent on the ability of people to architect, tune, monitor, and continually enhance
protective and detective cyber security controls. Without this foundational element, even the
most robust control systems architectures will not provide the necessary protections on a
continual basis.

3.3

Access Control—Information Flow Enforcement

Understanding the communication flows occurring within the ICS network—and conversely
those sourced from or destined to the ICS network—is an essential precursor to building a
powerful detection and monitoring platform for verifying network traffic and ensuring the
integrity and availability of the control process.
If devices do not have an operational need to establish a communications channel, the
architecture should support the capability to deny and prevent devices and systems from
communicating via a direct or indirect channel. In addition, asset owners should maintain the
capability to log and record traffic for systems attempting to establish a communications channel,
even if explicitly denied. Asset owners should also baseline intra-network traffic in accordance
with the operational nature of the control process. Common examples include the following:
•

Verifying and monitoring device-to-device communications.

•

Establishing security controls and enhancing visibility into the commands transmitted
between devices (e.g., reads, writes, function codes, acknowledge responses, and exception
messages).

•

Isolating and enhancing security controls pertaining to devices that can illicit write
commands or make modifications to downstream devices.

•

Verifying and monitoring for communication requests sourced from field devices attempting
to “back-channel” into the core of the control network.

3.4

Access Control—Remote Access

The nature of distributed operations, coupled with an observed reduction in the personnel
directly responsible for maintaining and monitoring process automation, presents a challenge for
real-time monitoring, response, and investigative actions, an important part of control system
operations. As asset owners and operators move away from maintaining personnel physically
located within a control center to a more distributed model for maintaining and operating ICS
architectures, this can create challenges. If not architected properly, remote access can elevate
risk and become a catalyst for potential unauthorized access or nefarious activity.
Remote access should not sacrifice security for the sake of convenience. An insecure
implementation and use of remote access capabilities can completely invalidate even the best
security architecture. Control systems and their supporting systems must never be directly
accessible through untrusted networks such as the internet; they should be protected and
sequestered from untrusted (external) networks and systems.
When designing a network architecture that supports remote access, asset owners should
consider detective and protective controls and include them as part of the underlying
infrastructure. The design should provide an inherent means to do the following:
•

Monitor and verify the scope of remote access communications and connectivity

•

Monitor communication flows occurring via the remote access channel

•

Log authentications (both successful and unsuccessful)

•

Enforce protective and detective measures pertaining to failed connectivity attempts or
nefarious traffic patterns

•

Restrict the scope of remote access sessions to only those personnel assigned a responsibility
for supporting the ICS and process operations

•

Disable split-tunneling when connected via a remote session (effectively routing all traffic
through the VPN or remote access gateway)

•

Enforce connectivity from only authorized origination systems

•

Implement application layer firewalls, application whitelisting, and endpoint policy
enforcement for origination systems.

The architecture supporting remote access should not only account for access required by the
organization’s internal engineers and operators, but also third-party contractors or vendors, who
may be required to remotely assist the organization.
Asset owners should implement multiple defense layers for accessing control system
networks from a remote location. Generally, most organizations require their personnel to utilize
a VPN technology using encryption to interface with corporate systems and applications when
accessing from a remote location. For control systems, the capability to directly interface with
supporting systems and components should not be permissible directly from systems housed on
the corporate or enterprise network. Rather, asset owners should only allow access through an
intermediate system or “jump box” resident within a dedicated Control Systems DMZ.

16

Access to the intermediate system should require a second layer of authentication, which is
unique and different from that used to remotely access the corporate environment or corporate
systems via VPN. In addition, personnel accessing the control systems network from remote
locations should authenticate using an appropriately strong mechanism (multi-factor
authentication) from a validated and secured company issued and controlled device (e.g., desktop
or laptop PC).
The intermediate system—or “jump box” within the Control Systems DMZ—provides a
centralized means to monitor, restrict, and govern remote access into the control systems
environment. This system also provides a capability to adequately limit the boundary of the
control system perimeter. Rather than virtually extending the boundary to the initiating remote
system, the boundary is now logically restricted to the intermediate system, where the necessary
scope of applications and protective and detective security controls can be deployed.
For third party vendors or contractors, the organization must ensure that remote connectivity
is subject to the same scope of security controls enforced for organizational personnel
connectivity via a remote avenue. To the degree possible, security policy should limit the use of
persistent VPN tunnels, and the organization should have the capability to directly control and
authorize specific vendors or contractors to initiate remote sessions. Asset owners should
monitor the duration of remote sessions and disable that function once service support is no
longer required or is complete.
Once the architecture is implemented, verification of all remote access methods should be
continuously enforced, to ensure adherence to the organization’s defined policy and their
supporting security controls. Asset owners should also test and verify the capability to readily
bypass remote access controls. As a practical example, the usage of dial-up modems is still a
common vector for remotely interfacing with various field device and systems. Modems are
typically overlooked, and are sometimes not considered when performing audits and assessments
of supporting components utilized as part of the control system infrastructure. If unsecured and
unmonitored, modems can provide a backdoor for directly interfacing with ICS components,
most likely undetected by the organization. Security controls for consideration include restricting
dial-in capabilities (limiting use to emergency “dial-out”), limiting dial-back capabilities to predefined phone numbers, or enforcing a PIN or passphrase for initial authentication. Asset owners
should also review the use of more recent technologies such as wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,
based on their potential to tie into enabled devices that result in bridging of networks. This may
enable attackers to use these secondary communications pathways to connect to ICS devices,
thus bypassing security controls.

3.5

Access Control—Least Privilege

Asset owners should assign roles and permissions to users of the various systems and
applications in the automation process based upon the concept of least privilege. Least privilege
is the practice of limiting access to the minimal level that allows for normal operations. Quite
often, users are granted permissions beyond what is necessary based upon a person’s assigned
role or responsibility.
Before assigning users’ specific permissions, an organization must formally define the roles
and responsibilities required to support operational needs. Once user roles and responsibilities
are defined, asset owners should review the technologies in place to ensure that the necessary
mappings and restrictions can be enforced, tracked, audited, and verified. Whether this occurs

17

locally at the application level or centrally within an access-control technology (Active
Directory, Identity Access Management platform), the organization must document and verify
how it will apply and manage permissions within the scope of its infrastructure and platforms.
The organization can then map and assign users and operator permissions, based upon their
operational need. Organizations should not allow the unnecessary use of elevated and
administrative permissions for daily job functions, and personnel should utilize an account with
minimal permissions assigned for normalized operations. If there is a need for use of a privileged
account for daily job functions, the organization should harden that system and consider
additional defense-in-depth measures to isolate and protect the system.
Logging and monitoring should track user activity and have the capability to provide a record
(including timestamp) of user activity occurring on a system or within an application. Asset
owners should log, audit, and review changes made by users, including changes pertaining to
user mappings, roles, and privilege assignments. Additional logging and security controls should
be enforced for users and groups that provide and assign an administrative or root-level context
within a system or application. Specific to industrial control systems, least privilege and
monitoring should include the following:
•

Roles, mappings, and privilege assignments of responsibility within SCADA or HMI
applications.

•

An audit record of personnel attempting to use an elevated or administrative account to
perform daily job functions (even for those personnel who do not require administrative
access, but are attempting to elevate privileges).

•

When monitoring and controlling an ICS process, it may not always be feasible to enforce an
automated lock for display terminals or display boards for idle sessions. For these conditions,
ensure that display terminals within areas of a facility where various personnel may have
access present a “read-only” or “view-only” capability, and that a standard user or someone
with unapproved access could not interface with a terminal and make unauthorized changes
or modifications to the process. Asset owners should also enforce appropriate physical
security controls for these areas (e.g., key card access on the doors to the control center).

•

Monitoring for specific changes to roles assigned to users and/or groups.

•

Monitoring of personnel or permissions assigned to groups, especially those that provide an
administrative or privileged context within a control system application.

•

Changes assigned to various areas of responsibility and privilege mappings.

•

Monitoring of access attempts, for personnel who are attempting to access a resource or
program function for which they are specifically denied or not assigned privileges.

•

If the organization uses domain services—for example, Active Directory—in support of the
ICS applications and systems, this domain should be separate and isolated from the domain
services utilized in support of the enterprise or corporate environment. The accounts and
services provided by the ICS domain should exist solely to support the ICS and automation
process. It should not have a direct trust relationship with any other domains or third party
entities.

Physical and Environmental Protection

Many asset owners rely upon physical security controls to safeguard and protect key systems
utilized in support of the process and automation. If adversaries can exploit a weakness in
physical security, this could lead to risks correlating to both cyber and physical consequences,
including the following:
• Physical theft or damage to hardware and data.
• Unauthorized changes to configuration settings and processes within the control and
automation environment.
• Disconnection of physical data links or interference of wireless (telemetry) data paths.
• Interception or manipulation (spoofing) of data, which could lead to system unavailability
and impact the integrity of the control process.
• The practice of operating with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in “program” mode
for the convenience of engineering and maintenance elevates risks associated with an
unauthorized user modifying the controller’s operating logic, which could compromise the
integrity of the automated process.
As many control system environments are widely distributed over a large geographic area,
remote sites and locations may not always be physically manned by personnel at all times. It is
especially important to enforce both physical and cyber security controls, including monitoring
for these environments. If a physical breach were to occur, this could provide a vector for an
outsider to gain upstream access back into the core of the control systems infrastructure.
Common examples of physical controls to include are as follows:
• A detailed inventory of all hardware and software components utilized in support of
operations, including detailed information pertaining to device/model type, serial number,
and firmware version.
• Physical access control measures for governing and restricting access to the facility,
including areas within a facility (e.g., gates, buildings, doors, and rooms).
- If utilizing keys, ensure that the physical control of keys is audited and maintained,
especially for personnel no longer supporting the organization, or who no longer have a
need to access various parts of the facilities.
- Ensure that physical keys are marked with “DO NOT COPY” or “DO NOT
DUPLICATE.”
• Enforce intrusion detection alarms and alerts for all ingress/egress areas within a facility—
including those at the perimeter and within various buildings and rooms (e.g., doors,
windows, cabinets, racks, and card readers). Special attention should be given to alternate
methods that can be utilized for circumventing traditional security controls for unauthorized
physical access to a facility.
• If utilizing cameras for physical monitoring of a facility or site, ensure the following:
- Default credentials and settings for the cameras are changed and modified.
- The cameras are resident on a secured and controlled VLAN or network segment, which
cannot be directly accessed by unauthorized personnel or systems within the
organization.

19

•

•

− The cameras cannot be used as a vector to gain unauthorized access or provide a
“back channel” into the enterprise or control systems network infrastructure.
- The cameras cannot be remotely accessed or viewed without authentication and logging
of the connectivity attempts (both successful and unsuccessful).
- The cameras provide adequate and clear coverage for the areas they monitor.
For systems that centrally manage physical access controls (for example, an access control
system that utilizes badge readers), ensure the following:
- Restrict physical and virtual access (including enforcing role-based access control) for
the centralized application that governs physical access control.
− This should also include the workstations and systems that are initiating connectivity
to manage and administer the physical access control system.
- Systems housing the centralized application or backend database do not have the
capability to establish an outbound session or communications channel to untrusted
resources or networks (like the internet).
- Testing of access control functionality, especially if communications from the centralized
application to the card or badge readers is lost. Asset owners should understand whether
the system operates based on the last configuration or “denies” access until
communications have been re-established.
If possible, place PLCs in “run” mode when in operation and remove and secure the key.

CONCLUSION

The protection of the Nation’s critical infrastructure is essential for ensuring public
confidence and safeguarding the Nation’s safety, prosperity, and well-being. As the threat
landscape continues to evolve, control systems and their underlying architecture must be secured
to withstand cyber-attacks. It is important that organizations conduct both risk and vulnerability
assessments for the systems that drive the automation and processes that support our Nation’s
critical infrastructure.
The high-level discoveries and mitigation recommendations outlined within this document
should not be used as an all-inclusive focus of an assessment; rather, these areas should be
carefully reviewed and encompassed within the scope of an organization’s overall cyber security
framework, design, and review. Addressing the best practices and recommendations in this
report can greatly improve a CI asset owner’s overall security posture and heighten awareness of
potential threats or cyber-attacks targeting their specific operations.
