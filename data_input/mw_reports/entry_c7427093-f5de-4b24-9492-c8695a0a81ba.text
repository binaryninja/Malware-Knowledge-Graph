Late last year, a wave of cyber-attacks hit several critical sectors in Ukraine. Widely discussed
in the media, the attacks took advantage of known BlackEnergy Trojans as well as several
new modules.
BlackEnergy is a Trojan that was created by a hacker known as Cr4sh. In 2007, he reportedly
stopped working on it and sold the source code for an estimated $700. The source code
appears to have been picked by one or more threat actors and was used to conduct DDoS
attacks against Georgia in 2008. These unknown actors continued launching DDoS attacks
over the next few years. Around 2014, a specific user group of BlackEnergy attackers came to

our attention when they began deploying SCADA-related plugins to victims in the ICS and
energy sectors around the world. This indicated a unique skillset, well above the average
DDoS botnet master.
For simplicity, we’re calling them the BlackEnergy APT group.
One of the prefered targets of the BlackEnergy APT has always been Ukraine. Since the
middle of 2015, one of the preferred attack vectors for BlackEnergy in Ukraine has been
Excel documents with macros that drop the Trojan to disk if the user chooses to run the
script in the document.
A few days ago, we discovered a new document that appears to be part of the ongoing
BlackEnergy APT group attacks against Ukraine. Unlike previous Office files used in previous
attacks, this is not an Excel workbook, but a Microsoft Word document. The lure used a
document mentioning the Ukraine “Right Sector” party and appears to have been used
against a television channel.

Introduction
At the end of the last year, a wave of attacks hit several critical sectors in Ukraine. Widely
discussed in the media and by our colleagues from ESET, iSIGHT Partners and other
companies, the attacks took advantage of both known BlackEnergy Trojans as well as several
new modules. A very good analysis and overview of the BlackEnergy attacks in Ukraine
throughout 2014 and 2015 was published by the Ukrainian security firm Cys Centrum (the
text is only available in Russian for now, but can be read via Google Translate).
In the past, we have written about BlackEnergy, focusing on their destructive payloads,
Siemens equipment exploitation and router attack plugins. You can read blogs published by
my GReAT colleagues Kurt Baumgartner and Maria Garnaeva here and here. We also
published about the BlackEnergy DDoS attacks.
Since mid-2015, one of the preferred attack vectors for BlackEnergy in Ukraine has been
Excel documents with macros which drop the trojan to disk if the user chooses to run the
script in the document.
For the historians out there, Office documents with macros were a huge problem in the early
2000s, when Word and Excel supported Autorun macros. That meant that a virus or trojan
could run upon the loading of the document and automatically infect a system. Microsoft
later disabled this feature and current Office versions need the user to specifically enable the
Macros in the document to run them. To get past this inconvenience, modern day attackers
commonly rely on social engineering, asking the user to enable the macros in order to view
“enhanced content”.

Few days ago, we came by a new document that appears to be part of the ongoing attacks
BlackEnergy against Ukraine. Unlike previous Office files used in the recent attacks, this is
not an Excel workbook, but a Microsoft Word document:
“$RR143TB.doc” (md5: e15b36c2e394d599a8ab352159089dd2)
This document was uploaded to a multiscanner service from Ukraine on Jan 20 2016, with
relatively low detection. It has a creation_datetime and last_saved field of 2015-07-27
10:21:00. This means the document may have been created and used earlier, but was only
recently noticed by the victim.
Upon opening the document, the user is presented with a dialog recommending the enabling
of macros to view the document.

Interestingly, the document lure mentions “Pravii Sektor” (the Right Sector), a nationalist
party in Ukraine. The party was formed in November 2013 and has since played an active
role in the country’s political scene.
To extract the macros from the document without using Word, or running them, we can use a
publicly available tool such as oledump by Didier Stevens. Here’s a brief cut and paste:

3/7

As we can see, the macro builds a string in memory that contains a file that is created and
written as “vba_macro.exe”.
The file is then promptly executed using the Shell command.
The vba_macro.exe payload (md5: ac2d7f21c826ce0c449481f79138aebd) is a typical
BlackEnergy dropper. It drops the final payload as
“%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT”, which is a DLL file. It then proceeds to run it,
using rundll32:
rundll32.exe “%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT”,#1

4/7

To ensure execution on every system startup, the dropper creates a LNK file into the system
startup folder, which executes the same command as above on every system boot.
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\{D0B53124-E232-49FC9EA9-75FA32C7C6C3}.lnk
The final payload (FONTCACHE.DAT, md5: 3fa9130c9ec44e36e52142f3688313ff) is a
minimalistic BlackEnergy (v3) trojan that proceeds to connect to its hardcoded C&C server,
5.149.254.114, on Port 80. The server was previously mentioned by our colleagues from ESET
in their analysis earlier this month. The server is currently offline, or limits the connections
by IP address. If the server is online, the malware issues as HTTP POST request to it, sending
basic victim info and requesting commands.

The request is BASE64 encoded. Some of the fields contain:
b_id=BRBRB-…
b_gen=301018stb
b_ver=2.3
os_v=2600
os_type=0
The b_id contains a build id and an unique machine identifier and is computed from system
information, which makes it unique per victim. This allows the attackers to distinguish
between different infected machines in the same network. The field b_gen seems to refer to
the victim ID, which in this case is 301018stb. STB could refer to the Ukrainian TV station
“STB”, http://www.stb.ua/ru/. This TV station has been publicly mentioned as a victim of
the BlackEnergy Wiper attacks in October 2015.

Conclusions
BlackEnergy is a highly dynamic threat actor and the current attacks in Ukraine indicate that
destructive actions are on their main agenda, in addition to compromising industrial control
installations and espionage activities.

5/7

Our targeting analysis indicates the following sectors have been actively targeted in recent
years. If your organization falls into these categories, then you should take BlackEnergy into
account when designing your defences:
ICS, Energy, government and media in Ukraine
ICS/SCADA companies worldwide
Energy companies worldwide
The earliest signs of destructive payloads with BlackEnergy go back as far as June 2014.
However, the old versions were crude and full of bugs. In the recent attacks, the developers
appear to have gotten rid of the unsigned driver which they relied upon to wipe disks at low
level and replaced it with more high level wiping capabilities that focus on file extensions as
opposed on disks. This is no less destructive than the disk payloads, of course, and has the
advantage of not requiring administrative privileges as well as working without problems on
modern 64-bit systems.
Interestingly, the use of Word documents (instead of Excel) was also mentioned by ICSCERT, in their alert 14-281-01B.

It is particularly important to remember that all types of Office documents can contain
macros, not just Excel files. This also includes Word, as shown here and alerted by ICS-CERT
and PowerPoint, as previously mentioned by Cys Centrum.
In terms of the use of Word documents with macros in APT attacks, we recently observed the
Turla group relying on Word documents with macros to drop malicious payloads (Kaspersky
Private report available). This leads us to believe that many of these attacks are successful
and their popularity will increase.
We will continue to monitor the BlackEnergy attacks in Ukraine and update our readers with
more data when available.
