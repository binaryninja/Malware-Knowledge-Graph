Cyberattacks Targeting Ukraine and HermeticWiper Protections

Stories
The latest cybersecurity trends, best practices,
security vulnerabilities, and more

By Taylor Mullins · February 28, 2022
Trellix is monitoring the ongoing cyberattacks targeting the Ukraine and any threat activity
targeting entities outside of the Ukraine. Trellix is continuing to add protections to our
products via the Global Threat Intelligence (GTI) feed and content updates as new malware
variants and behavior indicators are discovered. The Trellix Advanced Programs Group
(APG) is also monitoring the threat actors currently targeting the Ukraine and the threat
tools being observed in those attacks, monitoring for usage of these tools in your
environment can be a proactive step in detecting compromise of your infrastructure.
Analysis from the Trellix Advanced Threat Research (ATR) team into the activity of wipers
being deployed within the Ukraine leads them to believe that there is a likely a connection
between Whispergate, and the newly identified HermeticWiper.

Recommended Steps to Prevent Initial Access

Organizations should look to review the Initial Access Tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) associated with Russian nation state activity to proactively protect their environment
from infiltration.
Phishing/Spearphishing attacks utilizing shortened URLs of malicious domains.
Monitor for brute force activity to identify valid account credentials and Microsoft 365
Accounts.
Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, without exception.
Exploiting Public Facing Systems – CISA maintains a full list of CVEs that are known
to be exploited: CISA: KNOWN EXPLOITED VULNERABILITIES CATALOG
Disabling all ports and protocols that are not essential, especially anything related to
remote services.
unt and block open-source tools not related to business activities that have been seen
in prior attacks – UltraVNC, AdvancedRun, wget, and Impacket
Trellix Protections for the HermeticWiper Malware

Trellix is currently monitoring the latest wiper malware dubbed "HermeticWiper" that has
been observed in attacks against the Ukraine. Trellix Global Threat Intelligence (GTI) is
currently protecting against all known indicators associated with "HermeticWiper" and
MVISION Insights will note detections in your environment as well.

MVISION Insights will provide the current threat intelligence and known indicators for
HermeticWiper. MVISION Insights will alert to detections and process traces that have been
observed and systems that require additional attention to prevent widespread infection.
MVISION Insights will also include Hunting Rules for threat hunting and further intelligence
gathering of the threat activity and adversary behind the campaign.

MVISION EDR is currently monitoring for the activity associated with HermeticWiper and
will note the MITRE techniques and any suspicious indicators related to the adversarial
activity. Detecting and preventing HermeticWiper from spreading throughout your
environment is critical due to the destructive nature of the malware, once the
HermeticWiper has infected a system it will remove the System Drivers and Windows files
leaving the system inoperable.
