Turbo Twist: Two 64-bit
Derusbi Strains Converge
by Threatgeek • May 2, 2016 • 4 min read • original

To follow up on the March report on the discovery of a 64-bit Linux
variant of Derusbi used in the Turbo campaign, this post covers our
analysis of two unique Windows variants of the Derusbi PGV_PVID
malware. Derusbi has been widely covered and associated with
numerous Chinese cyber espionage actors, including the group known
as C0d0s0 Team (aka Sunshop Group) and its watering-hole attacks
using Forbes[.]com in 2014.
What made these two variants of interest is that, as of April 28, 2016,
there are zero (0) antivirus detections of these variants at VirusTotal.
On April 29, our team also scanned these variants with two different
local antivirus tools running the latest virus signatures and the APT
malware was still undetected. Based on compile times in the variants
analyzed, it appears that this variant has been around since at least
2013.
Some of the strings in these variants have also been observed in
variants of the Bergard APT malware. The Derusbi variants were
identified and named by Proofpoint earlier this year.

Our Yara hunting rule that detected these two Derusbi PGV_PVID
variants with zero antivirus detections also detected two other
variants that are detected by AVs as “Derusbi”. One of the Derusbi
PGV_PVID samples that we analyzed shares its command-and-control
server with a Rekaf sample identified by Proofpoint, furthering the
connection between these families that they established in their
post.
Interestingly, at least one of the domains used here is currently
registered with the China-based domain broker we identified in the
Turbo campaign report. After doing some pivots involving the IP
addresses observed in our analysis, we have a trove of very interesting
domains, all listed at the bottom of this report. These domains include
ones that might purport to represent prominent U.S. defense
contractors, media outlets, etc. It has to be noted that we have not
identified malware or a campaign that uses these domains, but in our
observation, the purpose of registering these domains would be to
launch a targeted campaign against the named organization or others
that trust them, such as partners and customers. These techniques
were widely observed in 2015, in events involving U.S. OPM, Anthem
Healthcare, etc.
These domain pivots have also shown us further connections between
these PGV_PVID, Rekaf and Bergard variants of Derusbi. The specific
indicators are provided later in this post, but the relationship is
illustrated with these tables. The dates on these records is worth
noting, since it could potentially indicate campaign periods.

In this vein, there's a clear preponderance of popular online
services and technologies – variants of Google, Office 365,
Virtualbox and VMtools feature in this domain set. It has to be
noted that these are technologies that are very popular across a
broad set of enterprises and offer a very broad set of
opportunities.

Malware Analysis
All four variants perform an HTTP request that is almost identical,
with the exception of the Command & Control server and a small
variant in one of the “Referrer” values. Even a 16-digit value in the URL
and Cookie was the same. This beacon format and 16-digit value was
also observed in the PGV_PVID variants analyzed earlier this year by
Proofpoint.
Three of the samples contained the following string of interest:
“payload_service_x64.dll”.
These PGV_PVID variants were observed encoding some of its
configuration, APIs and other strings with a single-byte XOR key.
Some of the keys used are: 0x90, 0xEB and 0x57.

It was also interesting to see how these samples were trying to
disguise themselves during entrenchment as valid services in the
system to try to confuse incident responders, computer forensics
investigators and network administrators. The following screenshots
show the Microsoft service management console with the legit and
malicious service (malicious service highlighted):
