Can You See It Now? An Emerging LockBit Campaign

February 28, 2023

FortiGuard Labs has observed a new LockBit ransomware campaign during last December and
January using a combination of techniques effective against AV and EDR solutions. LockBit has
been one of the more dangerous ransomware, active since 2019. It was part of several
successful attacks against a large variety of industries, including critical infrastructure.
This blog post discusses the infection chain and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of
this campaign.

Overview
Descriptions of the attack refer to the stages outlined in Figure 1 below. The attack starts with a
.img container (1) and a social engineering technique of displaying a single file once it’s mounted
while hiding the rest of its files from the user. It can also cause malware analysts to miss the
payloads while examining the samples manually.

The user is then prompted to open the single visible shortcut (2) file.

In some of the cases that we’ve observed, a python script is executed (2.1) using the official
Python embed package. The only purpose of the script is to run the subsequent BAT scripts.
Some variants used a known UAC bypass method abusing the legitimate fodhelper.exe (3.1).
This enables the attacker’s BAT file to run in a new elevated process without the user’s approval.
Figure 3: UAC bypass implementation.
The BAT script (4) does several things:
1.

Changes the password of the logged-in user.

2.

Copies its files to C:\ProgramData.

3. Ensures that after the system reboots, it logs in without user interaction (using SysInternals
Autologon).
4.

Tries to -

a.

Set the next reboot to be in Safe Mode using bcdedit.exe.

b.

Register a new service that will run its VBS script (4.1) using sc.exe.

c.

Sets the service to run also in Safe-Mode using reg.exe.

5. If it fails, it sets in the registry a BAT file (4.2) to be run on logon as another UI shell by
Winlogon.
6.

Reboots the machine.

Figure 4: Persistence of the BAT file (4.2).
The ransomware executable resides within a password-protected archive. The script that runs
after boot executes another BAT script (4.3) to extract the ransomware payload. It uses the 7-zip
archiver and then runs it with a ‘-pass’ argument that is needed for the malicious executable to
unpack itself.

The final payload is LockBit. Analysts from TrendMicro have published an analysis of the
ransomware.
Targeting focuses on Spanish-speaking victims – all samples target Mexican or Spanish firms,
mainly in the consulting and law sectors.

Evasive Tradecraft
The detection rate of the samples in VirusTotal was a minimal single digit, with some completely
undetected, suggesting the campaign’s methods are effective in defense evasion.
Figure 6: Detection in VirusTotal of one of the .img files.
Delivery through a .img container bypasses the Mark of The Web (MOTW) protection
mechanism. Multi-stage scripts that extract a password-protected ransomware executable, which
is unpacked only when run with a unique password, allow evading traditional signature-based
detection.
The malware authors have shown a creative and wide-ranging usage of signed, legitimate
executables: the mounting of .img files by Windows Explorer, python execution by a signed
interpreter, the extraction of encrypted archives by 7-zip, and automatic log-in using Sysinternals’
Autologon. This allows for minimal reliance on custom code, trimming development costs, and
staying under the radar of EDRs.

Summary
This campaign’s highly evasive nature demonstrates that attackers continue to leverage
increasingly obscure methodologies to avoid detection. This unique combination of executables
wasn’t seen in previous LockBit attacks.
These payloads may be related to the LockBit builder leak in late 2022. Hence, a definitive
attribution to the original group behind LockBit, or its affiliates, may be difficult. Other
cybercriminals would want to associate themselves with the deterrence already afforded by past
acts of LockBit.
