Fahrplan
This talk will take an in-depth look at the technical capabilities and vulnerabilities used by
Pegasus. We will focus on Pegasus’s features and the exploit chain Pegasus used called
Trident. Attendees will learn about Pegasus’s use of 0-days, obfuscation, encryption, function
hooking, and its ability to go unnoticed. We will present our detailed technical analysis that
covers each payload stage of Pegasus including its exploit chain and the various 0-day
vulnerabilities that the toolkit was using to jailbreak a device. After this talk attendees will
have learned all of the technical details about Pegasus and Trident and how the
vulnerabilities we found were patched.
