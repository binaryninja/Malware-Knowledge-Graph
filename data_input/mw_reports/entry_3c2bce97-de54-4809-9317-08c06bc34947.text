Uncategorized attacks happen frequently, with new threat groups and malware continually
coming to light. Novel and known threat groups alike are changing their C2 domains, file
hashes and other threat infrastructure, allowing them to avoid detection through traditional
signature and rule-based techniques. Zero-day exploitation has also become increasingly
apparent – a recent Mandiant report revealed that the number of identified zero-days in 2021
had dramatically increased from 2020 (80 vs 32). More specifically, the number of zero-days
exploited by ransomware groups was, and continues to be, on an upward trend [1]. This
trend appears to have continued into 2022. Given the unknown nature of these attacks, it is
challenging to defend against them using traditional signature and rule-based approaches.
Only those anomaly-based solutions functioning via deviations from normal behavior in a
network, will effectively detect these threats.
It is particularly important that businesses can quickly identify threats like ransomware before
the end-goal of encryption is reached. As the variety of ransomware strains increases, so do
the number which are uncategorized. Whilst zero-days have recently been explored in
another Darktrace blog, this blog looks at an example of a sophisticated novel ransomware
attack that took place during Summer 2021 which Darktrace DETECT/Network detected
ahead of it being categorized or found on popular OSINT. This occurred within the network of
an East African financial organization.

Figure 1- Timeline of (then-uncategorized) Blackbyte ransom attack
On the 6th of July 2021, multiple user accounts were brute-forced on an external-facing VPN
server via NTLM. Notably this included attempted logins with the generic account
‘Administrator’. Darktrace alerted to this initial bruteforcing activity, however as similar
attempts had been made against the server before, it was not treated as a high-priority
threat.
Following successful bruteforcing on the VPN, the malicious actor created a new user
account which was then added to an administrative group on an Active Directory server. This
new user account was subsequently used in an RDP session to an internal Domain
Controller. Cyber AI Analyst picked up on the unusual nature of these administrative
connections in comparison to normal activity for these devices and alerted on it (Figure 2).

DCE-RPC, and SMB connections were seen from the VPN server to the domain controller
using the newly created account. Note: this screenshot is from DETECT/Network v.5
Less than 20 minutes later, significant reconnaissance began on the domain controller with
the new credential. This involved SMB enumeration with various file shares accessed
including sensitive files such as the Security Account Manager (samr). This was followed by
a two-day period of downtime where the threat actor laid low.
On the 8th of July, suspicious network behavior resumed – the default Administrator
credential seen previously was also used on a second internal domain controller.
Connections to a rare external IP were made by this device a few hours later. OSINT at the
time suggested these connections may have been related to the use of penetration testing
tools, in particular the tool Process Hacker [2].
Over the next two days reconnaissance and lateral movement activities occurred on a wider
scale, originating from multiple network devices. A wide variety of techniques were used
during this period:
·
Exploitation of legitimate administrative services such as PsExec for remote command
execution.
·

Taking advantage of legacy protocols still in use on the network like SMB version 1.

·

Bruteforcing login attempts via Kerberos.

·
The use of other penetration testing tools including Metasploit and Nmap. These were
intended to probe for vulnerabilities.
On the 10th of July, ransomware was deployed. File encryption occurred, with the extension
‘.blackbyte’ being appended to multiple files. At the time there were no OSINT references to
this file extension or ransomware type, therefore any signature-based solution would have
struggled to detect it. It is now apparent that BlackByte ransomware had only appeared a few

weeks earlier and, since then, the Ransomware-as-a-Service group has been attacking
businesses and critical infrastructure worldwide [3]. A year later they still pose an active
threat.
The use of living-off-the-land techniques, popular penetration testing tools, and a novel strain
of ransomware meant the attackers were able to move through the environment without
giving away their presence through known malware-signatures. Although a traditional
security solution would identify some of these actions, it would struggle to link these separate
activities. The lack of attribution, however, had no bearing on Darktrace’s ability to detect the
unusual behavior with its anomaly-based methods.
While this customer had RESPOND enabled at the time of this attack, its manual
configuration meant that it was unable to act on the devices engaging in encryption.
Nevertheless, a wide range of high-scoring Darktrace DETECT/Network models breached
which were easily visible within the customer’s threat tray. This included multiple Enhanced
Monitoring models that would have led to Proactive Threat Notifications (PTN) being alerted
had the customer subscribed to the service. Whilst the attack was not prevented in this case,
Darktrace analysts were able to give support to the customer via Ask the Expert (ATE),
providing in-depth analysis of the compromise including a list of likely compromised devices
and credentials. This helped the customer to work on post-compromise recovery effectively
and ensured the ransomware had reduced impact within their environment.

Schlussfolgerung
While traditional security solutions may be able to deal well with ransomware that uses
known signatures, AI is needed to spot new or unknown types of attack – a reliance on
signatures will lead to these types of attack being missed.
Remediation can also be far more difficult if a victim doesn’t know how to identify the
compromised devices or credentials because there are no known IOCs. Darktrace model
breaches will highlight suspicious activity in each part of the cyber kill chain, whether
involving a known IOC or not, helping the customer to efficiently identify areas of
compromise and effectively remediate (Figure 3).

As long as threat actors continue to develop new methods of attack, the ability to detect
uncategorized threats is required. As demonstrated above, Darktrace’s anomaly-based
approach lends itself perfectly to detecting these novel or uncategorized threats.
