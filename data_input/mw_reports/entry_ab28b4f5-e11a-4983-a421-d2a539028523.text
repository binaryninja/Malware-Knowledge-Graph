In our recently published Security Navigator report we highlight the fact that ransomware
operations involving data encryption have been increasingly coupled with extortion tactics
from threat actors to further pressure victim organizations into paying ransoms. This is what
we term cyber-extortion (Cy-X). This trend is key when looking at the current threat
landscape. Indeed, most of the currently active ransomware operations perform doubleextortion (or even triple-extortion), for instance threatening to leak stolen information on the
Dark Web or to sell it to the highest bidder if the ransom is not paid or launching DDoS
attacks against the same victim.
Extortion in itself has thus arisen to a point where encryption is not always necessary: it is
equally lucrative to hack and leak an organization. This shift in cybercrime operations
partially results from the overall improvement by organizations of their backup strategies in
order to better prevent ransomware attacks, leading some threat actors to now only perform
this type of operations. This is for instance the case of groups such as Karakurt,
RansomHouse or Silent Ransom…

Double extortion is all the more problematic as leaked information can facilitate further
compromises from other threat groups. These leaks feed the ongoing data trade within
underground marketplaces and cybercriminal forums.
Until the fundamental systemic factors that enable this form of crimes are addressed, we
should expect to see criminals continuing to adapt and test new pressure tactics to rush
victims into paying exorbitant ransoms. We continue to see Cy-X groups come and go,
primarily because of how lucrative these extortion operations appear to be, along with their
apparent ease of execution and supposed anonymity. Even if law enforcement agencies
sometimes succeed in identifying and arresting members of these clusters, this often leads
to groups disbanding, rebranding and updating their tactics to further avoid detection.
This leads us nicely to a new ransomware group known as PLAY, which leverages double
extortion through its own leak site.
We first notified customers of the threat presented by PLAY in a CERT ‘World Watch’
advisory published in early September 2022
(https://portal.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/worldwatch/570462 for registered users).
“Trend Micro researchers detailed in a recent report a new ransomware, which adds
the .play extension after encrypting files and drops a ransom note containing only the
word "PLAY" along with an email address to contact the group. The first reports of this
ransomware's activity date from June 2022, when a victim asked for help in the
Bleeping Computer forums. In July, Trend Micro researchers investigated a large
number of attacks in quick succession in the Latin American region targeting
government entities.
For initial access, the threat actor has been known to use compromised valid accounts
or exploit unpatched Fortinet SSL VPN vulnerabilities. The ransomware group uses
living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) as part of its attacks, such as WinSCP for data
exfiltration and Task Manager for LSASS dumping. They use double extortion
techniques, compressing the victim's files with WinRAR and uploading it to file sharing
sites. The ransomware is then distributed via GPO and run using scheduled tasks,
PsExec or wmic….”

The threat cluster behind PLAY is yet to be extensively covered by security researchers.
Trend Micro was the first vendor to publicly document this threat actor in a report[1] published
in September 2022, where they provided analysis following investigations into attacks carried
out in July. Based on their analysis they believed that PLAY was the successor of Hive, a
notorious ransomware active since 2021. It also shares some overlaps with Nokoyawa, yet
another ransomware operation. However, there is nothing concrete that allows us to assess
with high confidence whether PLAY is definitely a successor of one of these two ransomware
families.

In early September, security researcher Chuong Dong also published a technical analysis of
the ransomware being used by PLAY, focusing mostly on its anti-analysis and encryption
features. In his blog post[2] he states that PLAY is heavily obfuscated with a lot of unique
tricks that have not been used by any other ransomware.
One of the first victim was the French ITS Group, who disclosed the breach via their website:

Since November 2022, our CERT started investigating a surge in PLAY compromises.
Recently our friends at CrowdStrike reported the exploit dubbed OWASSRF while
investigating Play ransomware attacks, where compromised Microsoft Exchange servers
were used to infiltrate the victims' networks. OWASSRF is a chaining of CVE-2022-41080
and CVE-2022-41082. PLAY has also been reported to exploit ‘ProxyNotShell’ (CVE-202241040), but CrowdStrike found that the flaw abused by a newly discovered exploit is likely
CVE-2022-41080, a security flaw that allows remote privilege escalation on Exchange
[1]
servers which Microsoft tagged as critical but not exploited in the wild when patching it last
November.
We searched for these three vulnerabilities in a significantly sized sample of our
Vulnerability Scanning clients and only found occurrences at 2.5% of the clients we
examined. Only CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 were found together at the same
client, and we found that occurence only once.
This of course does not reduce the significance of these vulnerabilities, which are clearly
being exploited in the wild, but it is encouraging to see that they are apparently being
successfully fixed by most of our client base.
In a recent, common practice amongst other Cy-X groups, PLAY ransomware recently
published a website, accessible only through Tor, where the group is disclosing details about
victims and leaking stolen data if the victim doesn't pay the ransom. The ransom note left by

PLAY used to be very blunt and specific to the victim with only an email address to contact
the threat group. Usually though, ransomware operators take the time to explain to the victim
how to acquire the requested cryptocurrency and threaten retaliation if they contact recovery
companies or law enforcement. This guidance is nevertheless being provided by PLAY in the
FAQ section of this newly published data leak site. The group behind PLAY are also following
a recent trend among ransomware operators whereby they apply additional pressure on
victims during negotiations by initially obfuscating the victim's name on the leak site, thus
giving them an opportunity to pay in order to prevent their full name from being released
publicly.
The ‘added’ date on the leak below is deceiving, because PLAY actually carried out this
compromise before the launch of their site. The compromise likely dated back to September.

Unsurprisingly, our Computer Incident Responses Teams (CSIRT) has encountered this
threat group in three different cases in the last month.
We held a call with one infected customer at 09h00 the morning after their systems were
encrypted in November. Investigations commenced immediately and by 12h20 our team was
processing evidence.
5/9

The customer in question is not a large business. The initial point of entry appeared to be
VPN access using legitimate credentials, and the ransomware deployment and encryption
had taken place over the course of just one day. On some machines malware was deployed
and triggered manually via RDP, on others it was via PSExec. Almost the entire environment
was encrypted. Onsite backups were either encrypted or destroyed. Fortunately for this
victim, a set off reliable off-site backups allowed us to recover most of the data and systems.
Unfortunately for this victim, several hundred gigabytes of data were published on the PLAY
data leak site.
Our CSIRT worked over a period of 8 days to assist and proceed to identify, track and
contain the compromise. A malware sample that proved to be PLAY was discovered early
on, and forwarded to our CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) to identify the strain
and capabilities of the code, using the sandbox described below.
Our experience across these cases leads us to suspect that we are dealing with a separate
PLAY affiliate, perhaps specializing in Europe. The IoC and TTPs identified in all three cases
overlap considerably, and in two other cases in France we’re aware of (but didn’t work on
directly) we believe the sample of the remote access tool ‘systemBC’ recovered was
identical. Yet none of the intelligence we collected from the three cases we’ve worked on so
far overlaps with intelligence we’ve received from third parties working on cases elsewhere.
Some of this infrastructure is still active and located in Europe, so some IoCs can be share
only once French or European law enforcement have been involved properly. Some are
nevertheless provided at the end of this report.
The first step for our Reverse Engineers was to determine the malware family, easily
obtainable with the .play encrypted extension.
The suspicious executable found on the system was detonated in our proprietary ‘P2A’
Sandbox to discover the attributes and behaviors of the file. We confirmed the family thanks
to a custom ‘YARA’ rule stemming from our World Watch advisory and automatically
embedded in P2A. This rule can be used to search for PLAY files elsewhere in ‘live’
environments. As a reminder, YARA is an open-source tool designed to help malware
researchers identify and classify malware samples. It makes it possible to create descriptions
(or rules) for malware families based on textual and/or binary patterns.

Our SaaS file analysis sandbox, P2A, can be used to easily confirm whether suspicious files
belong to one malware family. Fortunately, our sandbox allows for any analysis to be shared
publicly, so you can view this output directly here:
p2a.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/analysis/111551/publicshared/HMD8BYOHA7AEXAYL
The YARA rule we created then triggered an alert on VirusTotal’s ‘LiveHunt’ service
(https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001315437-Livehunt#h_b063a6e6-6de54aea-ab55-9d8ea46fbeb0). Livehunt allows you to hook into the stream of files analyzed by
VirusTotal and get notified whenever one of them matches a certain rule written in the YARA
language. By applying YARA rules to the files analyzed by VirusTotal we are able to get a
constant flow of malware samples of this family, including ones not detected by antivirus
engines. The match against our rule from LiveHunt confirmed our initial assessment that we
were dealing with PLAY.

Manual reverse engineering of the sample started on November 22nd. The process proved to
be challenging and required a full two-days of effort from an experienced engineer, who was
able to confirm that the obfuscation techniques observed those described in the analysis by
Chuong Dong we mentioned above:

https://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2022/09/03/PLAYRansomware/
Samples of the malware incorporate an obfuscation technique known as "Return Oriented
Programming" (ROP) and garbage code insertion to make analysis more difficult. Other
techniques used by PLAY ransomware include string obfuscation and import hashing using
the xxhash32 algorithm. It is highly likely that these obfuscation techniques have been
recently added to the malware but the code itself remains the same.
Following on from the three cases our CSIRT is engaged in, our Threat Intelligence teams
will soon publish an update of our World Watch advisory outlining PLAY’s recent activity.
Furthermore, our CERT has also now made publicly available a subset of the PLAY
ransomware IoCs contained in our Datalake Threat Intelligence database[3] (available as a
SaaS service named Managed Threat Intelligence-detect). As with our P2A sandbox, we are
able to share outputs from our database directly with our community, and made these IoCs
available for you here (updated once per day only):
datalake.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/api/v2/mrti/public/export-html/

8/9

These IoCs are used automatically by our Managed Threat Detection services. You can add
them also in your security detection solutions (SIEM, NDR, EDR, etc.), in order to alert your
SOC team. Orange Cyberdefense can orchestrate for you the automatic feeding of such
network-related IOCs in your security protection equipments (i.e. in various NGFW) using our
"Managed Threat Intelligence - protect" service.
