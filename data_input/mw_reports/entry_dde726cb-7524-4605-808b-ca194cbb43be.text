We look into how threat actors are exploiting Apache Hadoop YARN, a part of the Hadoop framework that is
responsible for executing tasks on the cluster. This analysis covers the payloads deployed, the tactics used in
the attacks, and basic recommendations for strengthening cloud security.

The misconfiguration and resulting exposure of cloud services is one of the most prevalent risks in the Linux
threat landscape. We previously analyzed incidents related to this security concern, such as an exposed
Docker API being abused by threat actors in the wild and exposed Redis instances that threat actors actively
search.
This blog post will focus on another piece of the puzzle: Apache Hadoop YARN, a part of the Hadoop
framework that is responsible for executing tasks on the cluster.
It should be noted that the exposure of these cloud services is not because they are inherently unsecure, but
only because of misconfiguration. Nevertheless, this is an alarming security risk as it allows remote code
execution (RCE) on the cluster. Unfortunately, threat actors have been actively exploiting these services for
years.

Figure 1. Example of malicious request on an exposed YARN service
To examine this risk, we experimented with exposing such services in the wild. We then learned that it didn’t
take too long for threat actors to find the exposed service and deploy various malicious payloads. In the
following section, we will discuss the malware families targeting exposed YARN services.

Payloads deployed in the attacks: Kinsing and other cryptojacking malware
As cryptojacking malware is known to be one of the dominant and common payloads for Linux environments, it
is no surprise that they were deployed in the YARN service as well. In this case, the payload belongs to a wellknown malware family — Kinsing (detected as Trojan.Linux.KINSING.AB and Trojan.SH.KINSING.G).
At the onset of the attack, the threat actors send commands to the exposed service via an HTTP POST
request. As an unintended response, the YARN then creates a launch script that incorporates the attackers’
commands.

Figure 2. Example of

executing script produced by YARN
Once the Hadoop container script is executed, it downloads a remote script that deploys Kinsing malware.

Figure 3. Example of a Kinsing family identifier
It also deploys a Go-compiled binary with spreading capability. This binary communicates with the remote
command-and-control (C&C) server, providing a backdoor to the infected system as well as deploying the
known Kinsing cryptojacking process called kdevtmpfsi.
Notably, Kinsing is not the only cryptojacking malware found there. The cryptocurrency mining arena remains a
battlefield for resources. We found a competitor cryptojacking malware in Hadoop YARN as well. This
competing malware then proceeds to eradicate Kinsing from the system.

What are the tactics used in these attacks?
Threat actors aiming to exploit these misconfigured cloud services commonly employ several tactics.
First, threat actors disable the system’s protection. As security solutions for cloud services become more
popular in enterprises, threat actors adapt by searching for and attempting to uninstall protection software. This
functionality is common in cryptojacking malware.

Figure 5. Example of cloud security tools and services removal
Threat actors also gather credentials. With the ever-increasing variety of platforms that require authentication
for access, the need for access tokens and so-called secrets — sensitive information such as credentials used
to access systems — also grow. It’s not uncommon for users who have a hard time keeping track of them to
save these on the machines where they are used. Sadly, this is done without any additional protection. Threat
actors are aware of this, and those who successfully access the systems actively seek these unshielded
credentials.
And of course, they don’t stop with harvesting: they also use these credentials to gain entry into other systems
— even non-cloud ones — to infect them. We have similarly observed this behavior in a previous research
paper on TeamTNT. With this, it can be deduced that threat actors try to infiltrate as many systems as possible
to maximize their gains.

It should be emphasized that if the private key that the threat actors used for accessing another system was
protected by the owner with at least a passphrase encrypting for the key, the infection of the target system will
be unsuccessful. This highlights the importance of employing such security precautions.
Finally, as we shared in our previous research on the Linux threat landscape, we found out that it is quite
common for threats to spread from one infected device to another. To do this, threat actors are using port
scanning tools such as masscan to identify exposed and vulnerable services. Once these services are
identified, the threat actors try to deploy their payload.

Other malware variants and environments
The list of payloads would be incomplete without mentioning the infamous Mirai botnet. A threat that is
commonly seen in internet of things (IoT) environments, it later evolved and also targeted other platforms such
as Hadoop YARN infected containers.

4/11

Figure 8. Example of open

directory of Mirai builds for different architectures
Since the Hadoop YARN service can also run on Windows, threats that were crafted for this platform can also
be found in the cluster.

Strengthening cloud service security
As reliance on online systems continues to grow, cloud services are becoming a vital part of enterprises. Cloud
security should not be taken for granted. Here are some recommendations:
Deliberately configure cloud service. Users can maximize the built-in security settings afforded by
these platforms.
Employ the principle of least privilege. Here, users will only be granted the minimum amount of access
required for their task.
Adhere to the shared responsibility model. Users, and not just cloud service providers, are responsible
for keeping these platforms secure.

5/11

Don’t store credentials in plaintext; consider using secret vaults. These store secrets in encrypted
form. They can also be used to alter secrets from one place and reflect that modification to multiple
applications without the need for a code change.
Cloud security solutions, such as Trend Micro Cloud One™, help enterprises secure cloud services. The
platform includes:
Workload Security: runtime protection for workloads
Container Security: automated container image and registry scanning
File Storage Security: security for cloud file and object storage services
Network Security: cloud network layer IPS security
Application Security: security for serverless functions, APIs, and applications
Conformity: real-time protection for cloud infrastructure — secure, optimize, comply
