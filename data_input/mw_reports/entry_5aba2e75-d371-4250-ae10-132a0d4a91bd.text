Background

Recently, ANTIY Labs detected an APT attack targeting some government agency in
China. The Shellcode for communication is conducted depending on Beacon mode which
is generated on the basis of automatic attack detection platform-Cobalt Strike. This kind of
attack pattern disguising as non-malicious real file in the host of its target, it sending a
network heartbeat package every 60 seconds, and it also send data information via the
Cookie field, all these features of this attack pattern are designed to evade the detection of
security software and the interception of firewall on the targeted host. Considering the
relationship between this attack and Cobalt Strike platform, we name it as APT-TOCS
(TOCS refers to Threat on Cobalt Strike.) for now.
The core step of APT-TOCS is downloading the script functionalities of Shellcode, which
downloads a field of data into memory for operation by calling powershell.exe.The
decrypted data is a field of executable Shellcode that is generated by Cobalt Strike (An
automatic attack testing platform). After loading the script of Shellcode, the Analysis Group
of ANTIY did a series of correlation analysis, then we found a PE program that maybe act
as a guiding executable file in similar attacks. The loaded Shellcode script can be used to
call command line to add a certain field of encrypted date into memory and run it. The
decrypted date turns out to be executable Shellcode which is generated by Cobalt Strike.
The related script can be loaded via the guiding PE program or vulnerability. This kind of
attack pattern has several features which including running in memory, no hard disk writing
2/17

operations, communicating via Beacon, multi-beacon communication is acceptable, and
several Beacons can work simultaneously. Such attack can be launched without the
support of vector file, in fact it depends on network projection and laterally move in the
internal network as required conducting an attack. So, it will bring great difficulties to the
forensic work. It is important to note that, all the Sandboxes we know are disabling to fight
against this kind of attack.
It seems that the attack capability of APT-TOCS is close to that of APT-level. However, it
relied on automatic attack testing platform instead of abilities of the attack team.

2.1

Analysis on incident sample
Leading files and sample downloading

APT-TOCS used “powershell.exe” to execute Shellcode scripts to realize remote control on
targeted system. The analysts of Antiy thought that the attacker might know several remote
injection methods of script downloading privilege, such as directly making the scrip be
executed on the host by using security vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, we found the following
binary leading attack files (hereinafter referred to as Sample A) were used in similar attacks
before:

The functionality code of the scripts embedded in this PE sample is completely the same
with the one of Shellcode script Antiy has acquired, while the encryption data of them
differs from each other. This PE sample was firstly uploaded to Virustotal on May 2, 2015:

3/17

Figure 1 Downloading encryption data using powershell.exe embedded in PE files
The PE sample used WinExec to operate embedded malware:

Figure 2 Using function WinExec to call powershell.exe to download leading data
Therefore, we can see that the “leading file” can be regarded as the leading part of attack.
However, the execution and control still can be made depending on system and application
vulnerabilities without this leading file.
According to above information, we cannot make sure this leading sample has relationship
with this APT incident.

2.2

Key mechanism

The core part of APT-TOCS relies on the encrypted data scripts (hereinafter referred to as
Sample B) downloaded by PowerShell. Figure 1 consists of various derivation relationships
and major module functionalities:

2.3

Analysis on the major sample (Sample B) of APT-TOCS

The content (Here omitted the content of base64.) of Sample B is as follows:

Figure 4 Content of Sample B
The functionality of this part of script is: decrypting the encrypted content of base64,
decompressing with Gzip, resulting in module 1 and using PowerShell to download and
execute.

2.4

Analysis on script 1

The content of script 1 is as follows:

5/17

Figure 5 Content of script 1
The functionality of this part is: decrypting data with base64 encryption and getting module
1, then writing to process powershell.exe, and executing and operating.

2.5

Analysis on module 1

The functionality of this module is as follows: calling the function of wininet module,
connecting the network, downloading operations of module 2; and executing by
downloading to the memory.

Figure 6 shows that using request of HTTP GET to get file:http://146.0.43.107/hfYn.

2.6

Analysis on module 2

Module 2 established and listed system process rundll32.exe:

Figure 7 Establishing and listing process rundll32.exe
Data that has been written into module 3:

Figure 8 Data that has been written into module 3
Though the data of module 3 started with “MZ”, it does not belong to PE files. Instead, it is
the Shellcode with backdoor functionality.

2.7

Analysis on module 3

The module might connect the following 2 addresses with port 80:
146.0.***.*** (Romania)
dc.******69.info (146.0.***.***) (Romania)
Sending request data and receiving return data.

Figure 10 Sending request data
The decryption to above IP, domains and accessing addresses is “XOR 0x69”.
Judging from the module strings and the system functions, the module belongs to backdoor
program that can send GET request to designated addresses and heartbeat packages by
using Cookie fields with 60 seconds’ interval. The heartbeat package data includes: check
code, process ID, system version, IP address, computer name, account, whether it is 64 bit
process. Then it transmits by making use of both RSA and BASE64 encryption.

8/17

Figure 11 The original data of heartbeat package
As the process ID and check code are different, the transmitted heartbeat package data are
different each time. The check code is calculated through using process ID and the
millisecond process during system startup. The algorithm is as follows:

The encrypted heartbeat package used Cookie field to transmit:

The authentication analysis on the technology
sources of this attack
The leading PE files, Sample_A and Sample B, associated by analysts of Antiy CERT used
the exactly same method of PowerShell. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that
Sample_A has no positive connection with this attack due to the high standardization of
relevant scripts. We still consider it as a series of attack incidents based on other
comprehensive analysis. The attacker might exploit the following ways to control the target
host, such as social engineering e-mails, file bundling, exploiting system and application
vulneratbilities, lateral movement of intranet and so on.
We found “Beacon” strings when analyzing “Module 1”. According to existed experience,
9/17

we doubted that Shellcode is closely related with automatic attack testing platform Cobalt
Strike. Therefore, our analysts carried out comparison analysis on Beacon generated by
Cobalt Strike, and authenticated the relationships between them.
Cobalt Strike is the GUI framework penetration tool based on metasploit. The business
version of it integrates the following characteristics: service scan, automatic overflow, multimode port espionage, various Trojan generation, phishing attack, site clone, target
information obtaining, automatic browser attack and so on.

3.1

Comparison of Module 1

We compared module 1 and the payload generated by using Beacon, and found only the
following different data: the Head data, request file name and IP address.

Figure 14 Comparison of Module 1
The left is sample module 1, while the right is the module generated by Beacon. We can
lead to the conclusion from the comparison: module 1 is generated by Beacon.
The screenshot of data package in request is as follows:

3.2

Comparison of disassembling commands of module 2

Our analysts compared sample module 2 and relevant files of Beacon, and found that the
disassembling commands between them are exactly the same with exception of
functionality code, including XOR encryption at the entry, downloading system DLL,
obtaining function address, function calling modes and so on. The following lists three
points.

Comparison analysis on module 3 data package

The following figure is the GET request comparison of the module generated by sample
module 3 and Beacon. Here we can see both of them use Cookie to transmit information
that has been encrypted, and send requests actively every 60 seconds. The data package
is heartbeat.

Characteristics of Cobalt Strike

Using Cobalt Strike attack can execute various operations in the targeted systems, such as
downloading and uploading files, executing designated programs, injecting keyboard
recorder, executing commands via PowerShell, importing PowerShell script, executing
commands via CMD, accessing system passwords and so on.
Cobalt Strike has the following characteristics:
Penetrating sandbox
Avoiding whitelist mechanism and cloud detection
Intranet penetration
Persistent attacks
Attacking various platforms

Conclusion

With an automated test platform Cobalt Strike, the attack penetration can penetrate firewall,
the approach the attackers used to control targeted host is covert and undetectable; what’s
12/17

more, it can attack various platforms, such as Windows, Linux, Mac etc.; it’s formidable
adversary to Trusted Computing, Cloud Detection, Sandbox Detection and so on.
According to the traces in the past, we believe that the threat has been active for 5 years;
unfortunately, there isn’t any powerful detection production and methods to defeat the
malicious attack till now.
The reason why the CERT Analysis Team of ANTIY classified APT-TOCS into APT
incidents is that it’s a kind of targeted attack (one of the features of APT attack), it has antidetection functions and also it can conceal itself. Compared with APT incidents in the past,
the APT attack in this case doesn’t cost too much, and the attackers aren’t responsible for
coding. With the application of commercial attack platform, the attackers saved the cost of
an attack, also the vulnerability built joint function provided by relevant attack platform
make the attackers easy to do injection. As a result, nations and organizations which
without its own elite hacker groups and abundant capital can also launch some kind of APT
attack via the attack pattern mentioned in this case. Meanwhile, it’s more difficult for us to
tracing when facing such modeled attack.
One of the leaders in Information Security area-Bruce Schiner said, “when big events on
information security happened, people tend to treat it as an example of cyber warfare. It’s
ridiculous. From my point of view, what’s happening and going to happen is: more and
more tactics in physical warfare are applied to cyber warfare. It’s important to note that,
attack capabilities can be widely distributed if attackers take full advantages of certain
technology, especially computer technology can make attack more powerful and
automated.” Obviously, highly automated commercial platform realized a high speed of
spread of this attack capability (exceeded our anticipation).
We have to remind all relevant parties that we are confronting with the risk of large scale
diffusion of network armaments which is led by the low cost of the attack capability. The
commercial penetration attack detecting platform has two sides, on one hand, it can check
the network environment of systems effectively, on the other hand, for nations,
organizations and industries which has limited budget, it costs too much. Given the
situation, all related parties should conduct more communication with each other,
additionally, there is no doubt that both offensive party and defensive party are supported
by superpowers, these superpowers should prevent the attack technique from widely
distributing.
The incident mentioned there has no difference with other cases we detected in the past, it
shows that, on the way to realize national informatizaion, we must fight against serious
security challenges as we confronting now; it’s also a good opportunity for our Chinese
people and enterprises to demonstrate our faith and the efforts we made to conquer the
challenge.
