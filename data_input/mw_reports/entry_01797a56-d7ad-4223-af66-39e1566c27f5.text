Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

Introduction
The Andromeda botnet is a well-known botnet that surfaced around 2011 and has
delivered well-known backdoor variants like Gamarue. In past revivals, the botnet has
been distributed through malicious emails containing attachments or links to
compromised websites hosting exploit kit content. What makes this botnet successful
is its highly configurable and modular design that can fit any malicious intent, like
distributing Zeus or, more recently, distributing a Lethic bot.
Earlier this year, the Andromeda botnet was seen using macro-based malware, which
is yet again an old trick. What makes this interesting is how the dated botnet and
macro malware trick are used together. Indeed, the past few months seem to be quite
busy for the Andromeda botnet and its recent activity indicates
intent in
the United States.

Threat Details
Infection Chain

Figure 1. Andromeda to GamaPoS infection chain

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

Stage 1: Botnet Entry
Andromeda is delivered to the desktop either through spammed emails or
exploit kit content:
1. Emails with macro-enabled
Word® documents are usually within
the context of invoice, payment, or sometimes an

Figure 2. W2KM_DLOADR.WJP, with a fake invoice, leading to a download of Andromeda

Similar to the recently distributed macro malware, the attached document
instructs the end user to download and enable its content. This allows the
macro malware to execute, thus completing the initial infection of Andromeda.

Figure 3. Document body, with macro routine

There are a total of nine domains used in this campaign, which is found to be
hosted in one IP address 80[dot]242[dot]123[dot]144.The domains are listed

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

2. Aside from spammed emails, compromised web sites leading to exploit-kit
enabled websites were observed as well. During this time, the Rig Exploit Kit
was utilized and SWF_EXPLOYT.YYJX was delivered to endpoints. The final
payload are usually Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) packaged
executables that bundle TROJ_YASIBU.SS or TSPY_SEKUR.YL . These lead
affected endpoints to download Andromeda binaries hosted on the IP
address 80[dot]242[dot]123[dot]144, similar to the spam email and macroenabled Word document combination.
Based on Trend Micro Smart Protection Network
, the macro-enabled
Word document was the most successful entry vector in the United States. The
main IP address 80[dot]242[dot]123[dot]144 has been active since the first
week of May 2015, as shown below:

Figure 4. Activity for the main IP address hosting Andromeda

There are nine domains that are used in this IP address. Correlating this back to
the initial entry point, the domain andropaul.com had the most number of
lookups and was used by most macro-enabled Word documents

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

Figure 5. Domain usage distribution

Globally, the United States (85%) is the top traffic source for the main IP
address 80[dot]242[dot]123[dot]144, followed by Canada (2%):

Figure 6. Global distribution of Andromeda-related traffic

We can say that this campaign has brought more bots under the control of the
Andromeda botnet than other campaigns.

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

Stage 2: Secondary Infection and Ensuring Control
The main purpose of spreading Andromeda is to cast a wide net and gain
control of endpoints, effectively making them bots or zombies. These bots can
now be controlled via a control panel to perform different commands such as
downloading and executing files, performing remote shell, or even uninstalling
itself from a system.
Upon entry, Andromeda introduces the following files to the system:





A copy of PsExec, a legitimate administrative tool in the Sysinternals
Suite
A copy of 32-bit or 64-bit mimikatz, a tool to recover clear text
passwords from LSASS
Several secondary downloaders, coded in .NET framework
And finally, GamaPoS , which is also coded in .NET
The combination of mimikatz and PsExec on the affected host furthers
the control over the endpoint. The endpoint acts as a launch pad for
deeper exploration in the network as the mimikatz tool can be used to
dump credentials and PsExec can enable lateral movement for the threat
actor. On certain instances, GamaPoS is installed.

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

GamaPoS

a .NET Scraper

When loading, GamaPoS evaluates a list of URLs to see which command-and-control
(C&C) server or control panel is up and running. There are usually a few hard-coded
URLs.

Figure 7. Initial start-up, selecting a control panel

The communication is done in HTTPS and, once a good panel has been selected, it
continues execution. GamaPoS only needs one panel to execute. It evaluates the list
from top to bottom.

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

Figure 8. GamaPoS monitoring processes

There are no process exemptions and GamaPoS goes through all processes and
dumps Track 2 data. Using the MAC address as the file name, unique card number
values are then stored in a text file in the folder being used by the malware (in this
case, %UserAppdata%\Intel Wired Network Adapter).

Figure 9. Main data management and exfiltration of GamaPoS

Finally, it attempts to upload the collected data via the C&C server that has been
chosen during initial execution.
While the evaluated example does not do Luhn validation, GamaPoS manually filters
the data by evaluating the first few numbers:



4 (length=12) Visa
56 to 59 (length=14) Maestro and other ATM/debit cards

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection




6011 (length=12) Discover Card
65 (length=14) Discover

Other Observed Movements
In the process of classifying indicators related to GamaPoS , we came across a
Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) package (SHA1:
ELVIK
OOO

Figure 10.

The name seems to represent Общество с ограниченной
ответственностью "ЭлВик", or Limited Liability Company "Elvik". While we
are not able to verify the validity of this digital certificate, we have seen
similarly signed binaries dropped after executing documents that contain
exploits for CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-1761
that these documents had found their way to some banks. These files were
distributed in Europe and Asia, which is not surprising as operators of
Andromeda had move and dropped financial malware on European targets
beforehand.
For example, we have seen a file (SHA1:
ad4dff33228e15baddeb407a4863e6445fdf120f) of the same construction
downloaded from the following URLs:

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

http://pos-softwareupdate[dot]com/<redacted>/pcicompliance.exe
http://pos-softwareupdate[dot]com/microsupdate/microsupdate.exe
It should be noted that the URLs intend to hide in plain sight:




The first URL refers to the targeted establishment. It was redacted at
the request of our customer. It is noticeable that the downloaded file
has a name of pcicompliance.exe so as to fool the end user to
download a file that would assist in complying with the Payment Card
Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or PCI compliance.
The other URL microsupdate.exe is made to look like an update for
the point-of-sale platform Oracle® MICROS®.

The certificate used and the reference to a possible PoS target links to
this particular event to Andromeda. The tactics may be different from
previously described uses of Andromeda and GamaPoS but are still
worth noting.

Victimology
Since GamaPoS is being distributed via spammed messages, we l up the threat in
scans done to HouseCall, HouseCall for Facebook, and
product users.
However, looking at the macro-enabled Word documents and Andromeda, the targets
for GamaPoS are clearly businesses. We have seen files and URLs accessed on
endpoints running WorryBusiness Security Services (for small-to-medium sized
businesses) and
(medium to large businesses).
Indicators of GamaPoS have been found in the various establishments, as follows:










Pet care
Theatre
Furniture wholesale
Home health care
Online market stores
Consumer electronics company
Records storage facility
Employment agency and professional services
Credit union



Restaurant
Software developer for insurance
Software developer for telecoms
Industrial supply distributor

Figure 11. Distribution of GamaPoS victims

Owing to the fact that the files hosted on the initial distribution of Andromeda held
two utilities of note (PsExec and mimikatz) that can be used for further penetration,

Conclusion
The use of an old botnet as a shotgun method to cast a wide net for targets has its
merits. Using spam and exploit kits to establish a large corpus of bots enables
operators of the botnet to re-sell interested interesting targets to other threat actors.
The entry points used in this campaign highlights the need for:



An effective spam filter that can evaluate attachments. We have discussed this
briefly in a blog post addressing macro malware.
The need for patching to avoid known vulnerabilities from exploits and exploit
kits

Trend Micro | GamaPOS: The Andromeda Botnet Connection

Another interesting move here was the deployment of PsExec and mimikatz two
tools that are widely used in targeted attacks. Trend Micro is monitoring the activity
of this ongoing campaign. Indicators that were used as reference in this blog are listed
below.
To enhance your security posture on your point-of-sale systems, please read
Defending against PoS RAM Scrapers: Current Strategies and Next-Gen
Technologies. Note that this threat combines a classic botnet with a PoS RAM scraper
and thus require a more sophisticated form of defense. The Trend Micro Custom
Defense strategy detects and responds to these kinds of campaigns to protect
organizations under attack.
