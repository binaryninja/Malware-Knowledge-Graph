We discovered a phishing campaign that has compromised at least four South Korean websites – including a
business page ranked as one of the most visited sites in the country – by injecting fake login forms to steal
user credentials. While we’ve previously seen cybercriminals inject a malicious JavaScript code in the
websites to load browser exploits or ﬁnancial information skimmers, using the watering hole technique for a
phishing campaign is unusual. The campaign, which we labeled “Soula” (detected by Trend Micro as
Trojan.HTML.PHISH.TIAOOHDW), collects information via a spoofed login screen of one of the country’s
leading search engines that pops up over the original webpage. It sends the logged credentials to the
attackers’ server even without accurate data conﬁrmation, leading us to think that the cybercriminals are at
research and information-gathering stage.

Figure 1. Soula’s attack chain.
We traced the initial JavaScript injection done on the compromised websites on March 14. The injected script
proﬁles the website’s visitors and loads the phishing forms on top of the main pages. It scans the HTTP
referer header string and checks if it contains keywords related to popular search engines and social media
sites to authenticate that the visitor is real. Since the HTTP referer identiﬁes the address webpage of the
source to the requested page, this check makes it easier to identify the visitor as a real user if the request
comes from one, as well as ﬁlter out bot crawlers or threat engine scanners.
The script then scans for the HTTP User-Agent header for strings such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, iOS and
Android to identify the device used by the user as desktop or mobile, which allows it to deliver the respective
phishing forms to the victim. Mobile users will see the fake login form pop-up only after clicking any button
on the compromised websites. To mask the malicious routine, it only enables the pop-up to appear after the
sixth time the victim visits the websites, setting a cookie to count the number of visits. The cookie is also set
to expire after two hours since the last pop-up.

If the device has none of the strings listed, Soula assumes that the user is visiting the website using a desktop
computer. Users will see the fake login form directly on top of the compromised webpage, asking the user to
input their username and password before they can continue visiting the site. The user information is directly
sent to the attackers’ servers. To prevent attack suspicions from the website, the phishing script sets a browser
cookie to the devices that received the phishing forms that enables the fake login to expire 12 hours after the
initial interaction.
We noted that the comments were set in Simpliﬁed Chinese, and used Cloudﬂare to protect their domains and
hide their real IP addresses. We contacted Cloudﬂare after identifying this attack, but while they immediately
removed the malicious domain from their service, the campaign did not stop. In fact, the campaign further
enhanced its detection evasion features. The attackers added obfuscation to the JavaScript code injected into
the compromised websites and moved the scripts and phishing page to a compromised web server to avoid
detection and prevent removal of their domain. The websites are no longer compromised at the time of
publishing.

Considering that one of the compromised websites are among the country’s top 300 most-visited sites, and
that the search engine hosts a variety of services for its South Korean customers as a trusted site, Soula is a
signiﬁcant threat to both enterprises and users as it exposes user credentials on a number of platforms.
Further, the content string it searches for and connects to may indicate cybercriminals’ possible plans to
develop this to a bigger campaign that could affect more people worldwide.
While this technique can be more difﬁcult to trace compared to socially engineered phishing attacks, endpoint
users can still protect themselves by enabling a multi-layered defense system that allows detection, scanning
and blocking of malicious URLs and pop-ups. Users should also enable additional authentication measures
such as 2FA whenever possible. Security administrators are advised to download updates as soon as patches
are available from legitimate vendors, and enable Content Security Policy to prevent unauthorized access and
use of exploits for remotely injected scripts.
