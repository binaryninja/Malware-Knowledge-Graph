4 Chinese APT Groups Identified Targeting Mail Server of
Afghan Telecommunications Firm Roshan

Insikt Group
Insikt Group has detected separate intrusion activity targeting a mail server of Roshan, one
of Afghanistan’s largest telecommunications providers, linked to 4 distinct Chinese statesponsored threat activity groups. This includes activity we attribute to the Chinese statesponsored groups RedFoxtrot and Calypso APT, as well as 2 additional clusters using the
Winnti and PlugX backdoors that we have been unable to link to established groups at this
time. Notably, data exfiltration activity for these intrusions, particularly the Calypso APT
activity and the unknown threat actor using the Winnti malware, spiked throughout August
and September 2021, coinciding with major geopolitical events such as the withdrawal of US
troops and a resurgence in Taliban control. This focus on intelligence gathering targeting one
of Afghanistan’s largest telecommunications providers is likely in part driven by the Chinese
Communist Party’s (CCP) purported desire to expand influence within Afghanistan under
renewed Taliban rule. The telecommunications firm offers a hugely valuable platform for
strategic intelligence collection, be it for monitoring of downstream targets, bulk collection of
communication data, as well as the ability to track and monitor individual targets. Moreover,
the Chinese government considers the telecommunications sector to be of strategic
significance in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.

Timeline of Activity
Insikt Group tracks and regularly reports on a range of Chinese state-sponsored threat
activity groups, exemplified by our recent RedFoxtrot reporting in June 2021. One of the
methods used to track these groups combines adversary infrastructure detection methods
and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) data. Through our tracking of malicious
infrastructure associated with known Chinese state-sponsored actors, we identified multiple
concurrent intrusions targeting Roshan over the past year linked to 4 separate activity
groups:
The earliest identified activity targeting Roshan is linked to the suspected Chinese
state-sponsored group Calypso APT, and has been ongoing from at least July 2020 to
September 2021, and was first reported by Insikt Group in August last year.
More recently, the same Roshan server was identified communicating with RedFoxtrot
PlugX command and control infrastructure from at least March to May 2021. During this
time, RedFoxtrot was also identified targeting a second Afghan telecommunications
organization.

Two more clusters were also engaged in the targeting of the same Roshan mail server.
These are referred to as the Winnti and PlugX clusters respectively and are outlined
further in the sections below. Both of these clusters appear unrelated to each other or
the Calypso APT and RedFoxtrot activity, but we have been unable to link them to a
tracked activity group at this time.

reporting (Source: Recorded Future)
The targeting of the same organization by activity groups under the same state sponsorship
is not unusual, particularly for Chinese adversaries. Many of these groups have separate
intelligence requirements and, due to the scale of the Chinese intelligence apparatus, are
often not coordinated in their targeting and collection. In this case, as visible in Figure 1,
there has been an increase in data exfiltration events associated with the Calypso APT and
Winnti intrusions in August and September 2021. This is indicative of both historical strategic
collection targeting Afghanistan as well as a further concentration of activity in line with major
geopolitical events.
Afghanistan is strategically important to China for several reasons, particularly in the wake of
the US withdrawal. For one, the PRC likely seeks to increase its influence within Afghanistan
to prevent regional instability and extremism from spreading into the bordering Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region of the PRC, as well as to other Central Asian countries. These
issues raise national security concerns and a need to protect PRC interests in the region,
including major Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments. The US withdrawal also presents
the PRC with opportunities for major new BRI-linked and extractive industry projects within
Afghanistan.

Technical Analysis

As shown in Figure 2, the compromised Roshan server has been identified communicating
with a range of adversary C2 infrastructure, particularly associated with the PlugX malware
family commonly used by Chinese state-sponsored groups. The section below contains a
breakdown of the intrusion activity by group.

RedFoxtrot
In June 2021, Insikt Group reported on RedFoxtrot activity targeting government, defense,
and telecommunications organizations across South and Central Asia since at least 2014.
We linked this activity group to Unit 69010 of the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support
Force (PLASSF) Network System Department (NSD) located in Ürümqi, Xinjiang, through lax
operational security employed by a suspected RedFoxtrot operator. The group uses an array
of bespoke malware variants commonly associated with Chinese groups, such as IceFog,

2/4

QUICKHEAL, and RoyalRoad, as well as other more widely available tools often used by
China-linked threat actors, including Poison Ivy, PlugX, and PCShare.
In follow-up analyses in July and September 2021, we identified RedFoxtrot abandoning
large amounts of operational infrastructure following public disclosure and reported on
several newly identified victims across government and defense sectors in India and
Pakistan. RedFoxtrot activity targeting Roshan ceased before our public reporting on the
group in June 2021 and was linked to the following PlugX command and control
infrastructure:

Calypso APT
In March 2021, Insikt Group reported on the Calypso APT conducting a mass exploitation
campaign targeting Microsoft Exchange servers using the ProxyLogon exploit chain (CVE2021-26855, CVE-2021-27065), alongside several other Chinese state-sponsored groups.
One of the PlugX C2 domains highlighted in this activity, www.membrig[.]com, remains active
and is linked to ongoing intrusion activity targeting Roshan.

Unknown Winnti Cluster
The Winnti backdoor has historically been used by several Chinese state-sponsored groups,
including APT41/Barium, APT17, and most recently a group tracked by Insikt Group as TAG22. The Winnti backdoor is commonly associated with activity linked to multiple groups of
loosely connected private contractors operating on behalf of China’s Ministry of State
Security (MSS). In September 2020, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged 5 Chinese
nationals linked to APT41, which had access to Winnti malware, with conducting widespread
intrusion operations targeting over 100 victims globally.

In relation to the Roshan targeting, we identified a high level of data exfiltration activity from
the targeted Roshan server and the Winnti C2 45.76.144[.]44, from at least August 17 to
September 12, 2021. We have been unable to link this Winnti C2 infrastructure with a known
group, but it is very likely separate from the RedFoxtrot and Calypso APT activity highlighted
above.

Unknown PlugX Cluster
Finally, the same Roshan mail server was also identified communicating with an additional
PlugX C2 server from April to August 2021. This PlugX C2, 45.86.162[.]135, is linked to the
Australia-based PS hosting reseller Crowncloud.

Outlook
Several Chinese state-sponsored groups remain highly active across Central Asia, often
operating in an uncoordinated manner, likely due to differing tasking and chains of command.
Like other geopolitical flashpoints such as India and the South China Sea, Afghanistan is
likely to remain a prime target for Chinese government intelligence collection following the
US’s withdrawal and the Taliban’s takeover. Always a prime target of cyberespionage activity,
telecommunications organizations are at particularly high risk within these regions due to the
intelligence value of the data they hold. Additionally, the Chinese government considers it a
strategic priority to influence the telecommunications sectors of countries participating in the
Belt and Road Initiative, giving it increasing leverage in the debate over global internet
governance.
