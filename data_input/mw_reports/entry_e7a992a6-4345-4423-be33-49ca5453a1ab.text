Practical Attacks against Mobile Device
Management (MDM)
Daniel Brodie, Sr. Security Researcher, Lacoon Mobile Security

Introduction
Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions are perceived to be the ultimate solution for mobile
security in the enterprise. According to Gartner Inc’s October 2012 report: “Over the next five years,
65% of enterprises will adopt a mobile device management (MDM) solution for their corporate liable
users”.
But do MDM solutions really provide the security that corporations are looking for?
In this whitepaper, we show how spyphones - surveillance tools surreptitiously planted on a user’s
handheld device – are able to circumvent common MDM security offerings, such as secure containers.

A Short Primer to MDMs and Secure Containers
Mobile Device Management (MDM)
As their names imply, MDMs are mobile policy and configuration management tools. With the rise of
consumer-owned and –enabled mobile devices in the enterprise (aka BYOD), organizations have
recognized the challenge of establishing and enforcing a standard policy to help them manage the influx
of these devices. MDM addresses these needs by providing management across four different layers:






Software management. Manages mobile applications, content and operating systems,
including:
 Provisioning and configuration
 Updates, patches and fixes
 Authorized software monitoring
 Backup/restore procedures
Network service management. Gains network-device information such as location, usage and
cellular/ WiFi, in order to support:
 Provisioning
 Billing
 Help desk/ support
Hardware management. Manages the physical device components, including:
 Provisioning
 Inventory
 Activation/ Deactivation



 Performance
Security management. Enforcement of security policies, including:
 Remote wipe
 Remote lock
 Secure configuration enforcement
 Encryption

Secure Containers
Secure containers separate between business and personal data on the mobile and prevent business
critical data from leaking out to unauthorized individuals. This is done by encrypting the data on the
phone and providing additional data security features, such as copy-paste DLP. A common scenario for
secure containers is to enable companies to perform a “remote-wipe” only on an ex-employee’s
business data, rather than removing all mobile data. Thus relieving the anguish (and possibly, also the
legal ramifications) of deleting the employee’s personal photographs as well.
Popular MDM tools offered with the additional layer of a secure container include: MobileIron,
AirWatch, FiberLink, Zenprise and Good Technologies.
How do secure containers work?
The secure container runs in the mobile’s OS supplied sandbox, where the separation between business
and personal data is implemented through encryption. All business data in the container is encrypted.
In addition, all communications with enterprise assets such as the Exchange Server and cloud-based
corporate apps, are performed under SSL encryption.
In particular, for iOS, Apple provides additional APIs for MDM solutions which are unavailable to regular
iOS apps. These may be used to retrieve information and manage policies. However, the MDM solutions
are still restricted in their enforcement capabilities.

The Mobile Threatscape
Looking at the mobile threat landscape, there are two separate categories of malicious mobile
applications:
1. Mass Mobile Malicious Apps. These are consumer-oriented malicious applications with the
obvious financial motivation. Examples of such malicious apps include apps that monetize on
premium text, dialers, SMS spammers, and mobile banking trojans.
These types of applications are not considered too sophisticated. Typically, the malware
developer places the malicious tool on Google Play – or other third party application market – in
hopes of reaching as many downloads as possible. Further, as a consumer-focused mass
malware, a device infected with one of these apps does not have much impact on an
organization.

2. Targeted Mobile Attacks, aka Spyphones. These are mobile surveillance software installed on
particular individuals. Once installed, spyphones are privy to all data on the mobile, as well as to
all communication passed on the device.
As opposed to the mass malware apps, spyphones are installed on a per-device basis.
Accordingly, attackers invest heavily in discovering, creating and developing new techniques to
install and hide spyphones on the user’s device.
This type of malicious software is used to target the organization, with the goal of cyberespionage. As such, the impact of such an attack on the organization is extremely high – from
gaining access to corporate emails and exfiltrating memos discussing the company’s roadmap,
to recordings of confidential phone calls and board meetings.
Spyphones are not used only against high-end targets. Private individuals have been known too
to be victims of spyphones - for example, in the case of cheating spouses.

Spyphone Capabilities
Most spyphones provide, at a minimum, the following capabilities which may prove to be costly to the
business:





Eavesdropping and surround recording. Examples: listening in real time on customer calls and
recordings of board meetings.
Extracting call and text logs. Examples: text messages which contain board meetings follow-ups
and voice memos.
Tracking location. Examples: tracking the location of executives at key accounts meetings.
Snooping on corporate emails and application data. Examples: retrieving corporate emails
regarding upcoming M&A activity.

The Range of Spyphones
Lacoon’s Mobile Threat Intelligence (MoTI) arm identified more than 50 families of spyphones. These
spyphones run the gamut from dedicated high-end groups targeting specific nations and corporations,
to low-end software targeting the private consumers.
Publicized examples of spyphones from the high-end of the spectrum include:

At the lower end of the spectrum are spyphones which most commonly portray themselves as
promoting parental controls and spouse monitoring. The operators of these spyphones follow a SaaS
business model where the exfiltrated data is stored and managed as a dedicated cloud service. Similarly
to a well-run business, the operators of these tools promise professional world-wide support. Their GUI
is simple and user-friendly to enable all users – from the tech-savvy to the technologically impaired – to
run their service.
The difference between the military and non-military grade spyphones? The device infection vectors
and accordingly, their cost. Current estimates hold nation-targeted spyphones at $350K1. In the
meanwhile, the commoners-targeted spyphones follow a monthly low licensing model– sometimes as
low as $4.99.
The amazing part is that the end-result is essentially the same on the targeted devices. So for just a bit
more than the price of a Starbucks latte, an attacker can purchase a spyphone with nearly identical
capabilities to that of a top-end spyphone.

Spyphones in the Wild
To paint a better picture of how common spyphones are in the wild, Lacoon Mobile Security partnered
with global cellular network providers to sample 250,000 subscribers. Sampling was performed on two
separate occasions. The first was conducted during March 2012 and the second in late October 2012.
It is important to note that these samplings were done on a statistically diverse group of cellular
network users and that there was nothing to suggest a higher usage of spyphones than the usual.
This type of monitoring provided real-time insights on the infection rates of the different devices. In
addition, it allowed the content inspection of the communications to the C&C servers and the analysis of
the data that the attackers gathered from users’ mobile devices.
Survey Findings
 Infection Rates.
The first sampling showed that 1 of 3000 devices had a spyphone installed.
In the second sampling, 1 in 1000 devices were infected with a spyphone.
 Spyphone distribution by OS:
In the first sampling – with 48 compromised devices- an overwhelming 74% of infected devices
were iOS-enabled.
The second sampling showed that 52% of 175 compromised devices were attributed to iOS
devices.

Myth-Busting the Security of Secure Containers
Secure containers may rely on different defense mechanisms to protect the corporate data:





Detection of JailBreaking (iOS) and Root (Android) devices.
Prevention of the installation of applications from third-party markets in order to protect
against malware.
Encryption of data
The built-in Mobile OS Sandbox component

However, these measures can be easily bypassed:

There’s a huge Internet community involved in JailBreaking/ Rooting efforts. A quick Google2
search will retrieve not only hacker-oriented details, but also step-by-step guidelines3 for the
layman on JailBreaking the device.
The JailBreaking/Rooting detection mechanisms are quite restricted. Usually, checks are
performed only against the features which signify a JailBroken/Rooted device. For example, it



will check whether Cydia – an iOS app which allows the downloading of third party applications
– is installed, or SU – the tool used by Android to allow privileged operations. More importantly,
there are no detection mechanisms for exploitation. So even if the secure container recognizes a
JailBroken/Rooted device, there are no techniques to detect the actual privilege escalation.
Android, for example, attempts to prevent malicious app installation. However, these
measures are placed with mass malware in mind. Furthermore, third party application
restrictions should protect against malware. As a security mechanism, this has previously been
proved to be defeated4.

Behind the Scenes: Bypassing the Secure Container
In the following sections we present proof of concepts for bypassing the secure container – both for
Android, and for iOS-based devices.
Android-based devices
A spyphone targeting Android-based devices can work in the following manner:
1. As demonstrated in BlackHat Vegas 2012, the attacker creates a “two-stage” application which
bypasses the market’s malicious app identification measures (e.g. Bouncer). By using the “twostage”, the attacker can publish a seemingly innocent application. Once the victim installs the
app, the app refers to the malicious code which is then downloaded.
2. The app exploits a mobile OS vulnerability which allows for privilege escalation. For example, the
recent vulnerability in the Exynos5 chipset in the drivers used by the camera and multimedia
devices.
3. The spyphone creates a hidden ‘suid’ binary and uses it for privileged operations, such as
reading the mobile logs (discussed in the next step). The file is placed in an execute-only
directory (i.e. --x--x--x), which allows it to remain hidden from most root detectors.
4. The spyphone listens to events in the ‘adb’ logs. These logs, and their corresponding access
permissions, differ between Android versions. For versions 2.3 or less, it’s possible to simply use
the logging permissions. For Android version 4.0 and higher, root permissions are required in
order to view the logs.
5. The spyphone waits for a log event that signifies that the user is reading an email:

6. The spyphone dumps the heap using /proc/<pid>/maps and /mem. Accordingly, it can find the
email structure, extract it and send it home.

iOS-based devices
A spyphone targeting iOS-based devices generally needs to first Jailbreak the device, and then installs
the container-bypassing software.
1. The attacker installs a signed application on the targeted device, through the Enterprise/
Developer certificate.
2. The attacker uses a Jailbreak exploit in order to inject code into the secure container. We use
the standard DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES technique to insert our libraries into the shared memory.
In this manner, our (signed) dylib will be loaded into memory when the secure container
executes.
3. The attacker removes any trace of the Jailbreak.
4. The spyphone places hooks into the secure container using standard Objective-C hooking
mechanisms.
5. The spyphone is alerted when an email is read and pulls the email from the UI elements of the
app.
6. Finally, the spyphone sends every email loaded to the spyphone’s C&C server

Conclusions
The underlying notion of the secure container is that they depend on the integrity of the host system.
This encourages us to deliberate the added value of the secure container:



If the host system is uncompromised, what is the added value?
If the host system is compromised, what is the added value?

Since the security of these secure containers is dependent on the integrity of the host system, it is
enough for the attacker to target the host system.
In fact, we have been through this movie before. Desktop applications which have attempted to secure
themselves, were targeted through the underlying OS. Although mobile OSes attempt to circumvent

Lacoon Security LTD | 1 Bezalel St., Ramat Gan 5252101, Israel | +972-3-3730358| info@lacoonsecurity.com | www.lacoonsecurity.com

similar attacks by blocking off the OS to attackers and users alike, common and ever increasing
JailBreaking/Rooting methods are rendering this safety mechanism irrelevant to targeted attacks.
In a similar fashion, the lessons learnt from the desktop equivalent may be applied here. If today the
security industry understands that controls on devices themselves are not sufficient anymore to the
real-world, we can expect the same in the mobile world.
It is important to recognize that infection is inevitable. As demonstrated throughout this whitepaper,
MDMs cannot provide absolute security. They are certainly a beneficial tool in order to separate
between business and personal data. As such, MDMs should be used – but as part of a baseline for a
multi-layered approach. To quote from RSA’s Security for Business Innovation Council report, “Realizing
the Mobile Enterprise”, “Mitigating the effects of malware on corporate data, rather than trying to keep
malware off a device entirely, may be a better strategy”. This approach requires thinking outside of the
box and the industry is now starting to wake up to this challenge and looking at the network level for
threat mitigation. For example, solutions can look at different network parameters and aberrant
behavior to signify an infected device. Parameters may be traffic to well-known C&C servers, heuristic
behavioral analysis which signify abnormal behavior, sequences of events and data intrusion detection.
