‘Operation Oceansalt’ Attacks South Korea,
U.S., and Canada With Source Code From
Chinese Hacker Group
Introduction
McAfee® Advanced Threat Research and Anti-Malware Operations teams have discovered
another unknown data reconnaissance implant targeting Korean-speaking users. We
have named this threat Operation Oceansalt based on its similarity to the earlier malware
Seasalt, which is related to earlier Chinese hacking operations. Oceansalt reuses a portion
of code from the Seasalt implant (circa 2010) that is linked to the Chinese hacking group
Comment Crew. Oceansalt appears to have been part of an operation targeting South
Korea, United States, and Canada in a well-focused attack. A variation of this malware has
been distributed from two compromised sites in South Korea. (They are currently offline.)
Oceansalt appears to be the first stage of an advanced persistent threat. The malware can
send system data to a control server and execute commands on infected machines, but
we do not yet know its ultimate purpose. The Advanced Threat Research team has not
previously described this implant in any of our analyses.
Comment Crew or Another Actor?
The actions of Comment Crew, also known as APT1,
were exposed in 2013 in a ground-breaking report on
Chinese cyber espionage against the United States. This
report detailed the inner workings of Comment Crew
and its cyber offensive capabilities. The consequences
of releasing this public report forced the group to either
make changes to their techniques or cease their activity
altogether. Until this analysis, we had observed no

new activity related to Comment Crew since they were
exposed, but now we find portions of their implant code
appearing in new operations targeting South Korea.
As we investigated this code overlap, we found no
evidence that the source code from Comment Crew
was ever made public, nor did we find it being sold in
underground markets we examined. Has Comment
Crew returned? We think it is unlikely. Due to the lack of
indications that this is a new Comment Crew campaign, it

raises the question of who is responsible. Based on our
research, we offer a few potential scenarios that could
explain the existence of Comment Crew’s code in the
current actor’s malware targeting South Koreans.
■■

■■

■■

This is a code-sharing arrangement between two
actors
An actor has privately gained access to the source
code from someone involved in the original Comment
Crew operations
This is a “false flag” operation using Comment Crew’s
code to make it appear that China and North Korea
have collaborated on this cyberattack

Does the Actor Speak Korean?
The contents of the malicious documents were written in
Korean and contained subjects specifically relating to the
finances of projects in South Korea. These documents
appear to be unique, not found on open-source
channels. We were not able to determine the source of
these documents, suggesting they were created by the
actor.
The metadata in the malicious Microsoft Office
documents used in the attacks contains a Koreanlanguage code page. This data indicates the document
contained the Korean-language pack, most likely to
ensure the victims could read it. We also see a consistent
author, which is typical of the techniques of previous
campaigns we have analyzed that involved malicious
documents targeting South Koreans.

The Advanced Threat Research team concludes that we
have found a new implant family created by an actor
targeting Korean-speaking users and using components
from Comment Crew’s source code. Furthermore it is
likely that the actor has a good working knowledge of the
Korean language.

Targets
During our research we discovered the initial attack
vector was spear phishing, with two malicious Koreanlanguage Microsoft Excel documents acting as
downloaders of this implant. According to our document
analysis, the targets likely had knowledge of South
Korean public infrastructure projects and related
financials—a clear indication that the actor focused
initially on infrastructure.
A second round of malicious documents, this time in
Microsoft Word, carried the same metadata and author
as the Excel documents. The content was related to the
financials of the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund. The

‘Operation Oceansalt’ Attacks South Korea, U.S., and Canada With Source Code From Chinese Hacker Group

REPORT

malicious activity first appeared on May 31, 2018, in
South Korea. Further telemetry indicates organizations
outside of Korea have fallen victim to this attack; as of
August 14, the attack had reached multiple industries in
Canada and the United States.

Further, the code overlaps with that from a previously
reported advanced state-sponsored group. The overlap
suggests a close collaboration between members of
a state-sponsored group and the current actors in
conducting cyber operations.

The date of the attack’s first appearance in North
America is unknown. We did not find Office documents
affecting targets in Canada and the United States, but
our telemetry indicates the threat has also affected
systems in North America. It is possible the attack
on North American companies is part of a separate
campaign from the one targeting Koreans, especially
because we discovered only a handful of malicious
documents and they distributed only one variant of the
implant out of several we found. Based on our telemetry,
the team learned these organizations were in the
investment, banking, and agriculture industries.

Campaign Analysis

Objectives and Impact
Our research suggests the targets were those who
would read documents related to South Korea’s public
construction expenses, Inter-Korean Cooperation fund,
or other global financial data. One possible motive for
the campaign is financial theft. These attacks might
be a precursor to a much larger attack that could be
devastating given the control the attackers have over
their infected victims. The impact of these operations
could be huge: Oceansalt gives the attackers full control
of any system they manage to compromise and the
network it is connected to. A bank’s network would be
an especially lucrative target.

The campaign to target and compromise victims across
the world began in Korea and expanded globally in
stages. The distribution URLs for the implants were fairly
consistent for the malicious documents; it appears the
actor hacked a number of South Korean websites to
host the implant code.

Wave One: South Korean higher education
The first wave of attacks began with a malicious
document created May 18, with a last saved date of May
28. The author of this Korean-language document was
Lion, whom we will continue to see throughout later
documents.

Figure 2. Metadata from a first-wave malicious document.

‘Operation Oceansalt’ Attacks South Korea, U.S., and Canada With Source Code From Chinese Hacker Group

REPORT

In the first wave the malicious Excel file contains a list of
Korean names, physical addresses, and email addresses.
Many of the names belong to those involved in higher
education in South Korea or who attend various
institutes. However, the list is random and looks like a
copy of a database of personal information from a South
Korean government authority.
This document contains macro code to download the
implant from www.[redacted].kr/admin/data/member/1/
log.php and execute it as V3UI.exe, the name of a
security product in South Korea.

hxxp://[redacted].kr/admin/data/member/1/log.php
Figure 3. The download URL for the second wave of attacks, against
public infrastructure.

This Excel document was created May 31 by the author
Lion, a day before the implant was compiled and hosted
on the distribution site. The documents appear to be
related to South Korean public infrastructure projects
and their expenses. Based on our analysis of the
documents, it is clear that this attack is targeted toward
South Korean individuals in this field.

Wave Two: South Korean public infrastructure
The Advanced Threat Research team discovered that the
implant was hosted at a legitimate site in South Korea
belonging to a music teachers organization that has
no relationship to the malicious document. The actor
hosted a PHP page that triggered the download of the
implant from a malicious VBA script embedded in two
Excel documents, which contained Visual Basic macros
to communicate, download, and install an implant on
the victim’s system once the document was opened and
viewed. The documents were submitted to us by a South
Korean organization during the first wave of attacks.

Wave Three: Inter-Korean Cooperation
The third wave included a Word document with
the same type of macro code as the Excel files. The
document contained fake information related to the
financials of the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund. The
document was created at the same time as the attacks
on South Korean public infrastructure officials. Lion
authored both Excel and Word documents. This Word
document used a different South Korean compromised
website to distribute the implant. In this wave, an
additional Excel document appeared with telephone
numbers and contact information connected to the
content of the Word document.

Wave Four: Targets outside of South Korea

Wave Five: South Korea and United States

We identified a small number of targets outside of
South Korea, as the attacks expanding their scope. We
have yet to identify the malicious documents involved
in delivering this implant to the victims. Because Waves
One and Two contained different distribution servers
for the implant, we expect this wave had its own as well.
According to McAfee telemetry data between August 10
and 14, these North American targets fall within several
industries:

The Oceansalt implant was not limited to just one
sample. We discovered additional variants using
different control servers. As we continued to investigate,
we found more samples, though obfuscated to
avoid detection. The samples were all identical to
the initial Oceansalt implant. The fifth-wave samples
were compiled between June 13 and July 17 and were
submitted to us by organizations in South Korea and the
United States.

Control Server
The campaign employed multiple control servers. We
observed the following IP addresses in implants dating
from June to July.

■■

211.104.160.196

■■

27.102.112.179

■■

158.69.131.78

Our telemetry shows this campaign is operational in
several countries. Address 211.104.160.196 indicates
infections in Costa Rica, the United States, and the
Philippines. Address 158.69.131.78 reveals additional
infections in the United States and Canada.
These machines resided in numerous countries
from August 18–21. Because this operation involves
multifunction implants, these machines are likely to be
part of a larger covert listener network. The Advanced
Threat Research team has observed this kind of
targeting in similar operations that compromise victims
as control server relays.

Implant Origins
Our initial investigation into earlier similar samples led
us to a variant—bf4f5b4ff7ed9c7275496c07f9836028,
compiled in 2010. Oceansalt uses portions of code from
this sample; their overall similarity is 21%. The reused
code is unique, is not considered a common library or
common code, and serves reconnaissance and control.

13

The misclassified sample used a Comment
Crew domain. Further investigation revealed
the misclassified sample is 99% like Seasalt
(5e0df5b28a349d46ac8cc7d9e5e61a96), a Comment
Crew implant reported to have been used in their
operations around 2010. Thus the Oceansalt actor is
reusing portions of code from Seasalt to form a new
implant. Based on the overall techniques, Oceansalt is
unlikely to signal a rebirth of Comment Crew, raising the
question of how the actor obtained the Seasalt code.
Was it provided to this or another actor, or was it leaked
and discovered by this actor? We have been unable to
find any evidence in underground or public forums that
suggest the source code of Seasalt has been leaked or
made available.
We discovered another batch of samples compiled
on July 16–17 that are obfuscated and essentially the
same implant, with minor changes such as the control
servers. Some of the samples are missing reverse-shell
functionality, indicating that this actor has access to
Seasalt source code and can compile implants from
the original source. This could demonstrate is a level of
collaboration between two nation-states on their cyber
offensive programs.

Code Similarities with Seasalt
Oceansalt contains the following strings that are part of
Seasalt:

Both implants have a high degree of similarity in code
sharing and functions. A few of their commonalities
follow.

Command handler and index table similarities
The command handler for both implants uses similar
semantics and command codes to execute the same
functionalities. Even the mechanism for calculating the
command code is similar. Seasalt code is represented on
the left and Oceansalt appears on the right:

Command and capability similarities
Both implants execute their capabilities in the same
way, which indicates they were both developed from
the same code base. The response codes used by
both implants to indicate the success or failure of the
commands executed on the endpoint are also an exact
match. Some of these similarities:

Drive reconnaissance capability: Similar code
signatures. Both implants use the same codes to

Code Differences from Seasalt
There are a few differences between the two implants
in implementation; these demonstrate that Oceansalt
is not simply a recompilation of Seasalt source code.
However, these differences also provide evidence that
Oceansalt is an evolution of Seasalt.
■■

■■

■■

Encoding: The Oceansalt implant uses an encoding
and decoding mechanism before any data is sent to
the control server. The Seasalt implant does not use
this encoding and sends unencrypted data to the
control server.
Control server address: Oceansalt uses a hardcoded
control server address to establish communication.
Seasalt parses the control address from its binary by
decoding data.
Persistence: Oceansalt has no persistence
mechanisms to ensure continued infection over
endpoint reboots. Seasalt, on the other hand, copies
itself to C:\DOCUMEN~1\<userid>\java.exe and creates
a registry entry to ensure infection after reboot:
−− HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\currentVersion\
Run | sysinfo

Based on the executable header information, Seasalt
was compiled on March 30, 2010. Oceansalt was
compiled on June 1, 2018. Highlighting the compilation
timestamps is important because, as our preceding
analysis demonstrates, the samples have a high degree
of code sharing:

18

■■

Multiple code matches and similarities

■■

Multiple functional similarities

■■

Identical command capabilities

■■

Same command and response codes issued by and
sent to the control server

The code used to create the reverse shell in Oceansalt
is an exact match with that of Comment Crew’s Seasalt
implant. The mechanism for creating the reverse shell
(pipe-based inter-process communication for standard
I/O handles) is also seen in Comment Crew implants
such as WebC2-CSON and WebC2-GREENCAT.
These matches lead us to believe that Oceansalt is
based on Seasalt, because it reuses much of the code
base developed 10 years ago. Seasalt’s public disclosure
in the Comment Crew report does not seem to have
discouraged Oceansalt’s developer.

Some of the partially obfuscated Oceansalt implants
are missing the reverse-shell capability. All other
capabilities (code signatures, response codes, etc.)
and command codes are similar. (Command codes are
either the same or off by 1.) Modifying capabilities in
this fashion is possible only with access to the source
code of Seasalt.

to their victims, without scrubbing the debug strings
The Oceansalt implant
531dee019792a089a4589c2cce3dac95 (compiled June
1) contains a few key features that indicate compilation
from the source code of Seasalt:
−− Does not contain the reverse-shell capability
−− Does not contain the drive recon capability
−− Loads API SHGetFileInfoA() dynamically without
statically importing it. This also suggests that
Seasalt’s source code was modified before
compilation.

Oceansalt Capabilities
Oceansalt is 76KB, a minimal on-disk footprint that is
harder to detect than larger malware. The implant has a
variety of capabilities for capturing data from the victim’s
machine using a structured command system. From
our research we have determined that this implant is a
first-stage component. Further stages are downloaded
through its commands. Oceansalt also supports
commands enabling the attacker to take various actions
on the victim’s system.

Initial reconnaissance
Oceansalt starts by trying to connect to its control server
at 158.69.131.78:8080. Once connected, the implant
sends the following information about the endpoint:
■■

IP address

■■

Computer name

■■

File path of the implant

All data sent to the control server is encoded with a NOT
operation on each byte.

Conclusion
Based on our analysis, the McAfee Advanced Threat
Research team has named this global threat Operation
Oceansalt. This operation has focused on targets in
South Korea and other countries with new malware that
has roots in Comment Crew activity from 2010.
Our research shows that Comment Crew’s malware in
part lives on in different forms employed by another
advanced persistent threat group operating primarily
against South Korea. This research represents how
threat actors including nation-states might collaborate
on their campaigns. McAfee continues to monitor the
threat landscape in Asia and around the world to track
the evolution of known groups and changes to their
techniques.

Persistence
Oceansalt has no persistence capabilities to remain on
the endpoint after the system reboots
This lack suggests other components in the infection
chain may ensure persistence and carry out other
malicious activities
