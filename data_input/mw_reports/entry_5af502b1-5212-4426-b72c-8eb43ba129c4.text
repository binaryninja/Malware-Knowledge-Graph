The SolarWinds Orion backdoor, known as SUNBURST or Solorigate, has been analyzed by
numerous experts from Microsoft, FireEye and several anti-virus vendors. However, we have
noticed that many of the published reports are either lacking or incorrect in how they
describe the steps involved when a client gets targeted by the threat actors. We have
therefore decided to publish this writeup, which is based on the analysis we did of the
SolarWinds backdoor when creating our SunburstDomainDecoder tool.
UPDATE March 1, 2021
Fixed errors in the Stage 2 beacon structure and added a CyberChef recipe link.
avsvmcloud.com DNS queries are not DGA related
The DNS communication between the backdoored SolarWinds Orion clients and the
authoritative name server for avsvmcloud.com is not caused by a Domain Generation
Algorithm (DGA), it's actually a fully functional two-way communication C2 channel. The
clients encode information, such as the internal AD domain and installed security
applications into the DNS queries and the DNS responses from the name server are used to
instruct the clients to continue beaconing, stop beaconing or to target a client by proceeding
to what we call Stage 2 operation. Thus, the authoritative name server for avsvmcloud.com
was actually the C2 server for Stage 1 and 2 operation of the SolarWinds backdoor.

Command: Continue Beaconing
The default response from the name server is the "Continue Beaconing" command, which
indicates that the threat actors have not yet decided if the SolarWinds client is of interest for
further activity. Receiving a DNS A record in any of the following net ranges instructs the
SolarWinds backdoor to continue beaconing:
8.18.144.0/23
71.152.53.0/24
87.238.80.0/21
199.201.117.0/24
In "Stage 1" operation the SUNBURST client starts out in the "New" mode where it exfiltrates
the internal AD domain name. The AD domain data is often split into multiple DNS queries to
reduce the length of each DNS query. The client later proceeds to the "Append" mode when
the full AD domain has been exfiltrated. In "Append" mode the client transmits a list of
installed or running security applications to the DNS C2 server, as we have described in our
Extracting Security Products from SUNBURST DNS Beacons blog post. The client remains
in Append mode until it gets either terminated or targeted.
Note: It is also possible to reset a client back to the "New" mode with a so-called "Ipx"
command, but that is out of scope for this blog post.
Command: Stop Beaconing
The stop beaconing command terminates the DNS beaconing, so that the client no longer
retrieves any commands from the C2 server. The C2 communication is stopped after
receiving a DNS DNS A or AAAA record in any of the following ranges:
20.140.0.0/15
96.31.172.0/24
2/7

131.228.12.0/22
144.86.226.0/24
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
224.0.0.0/3

Command: Target Client
A SUNBURST client that has been "targeted" will change a flag called rec.dnssec in the
source code from false to true. We call this flag the "Stage 2" flag, which must be set in order
for the client to accept a CNAME record and proceed to Stage 3. Symantec refer to the
Stage 2 flag as "a bit flag representing whether the previous DNS response successfully
contained partial or full instructions to start the secondary HTTP communication channel".
A DNS A record in any of the following three IP ranges can be used to set the "Stage 2" flag:
18.130.0.0/16
99.79.0.0/16
184.72.0.0/15
The state of the Stage 2 flag is actually signaled in the avsvmcloud.com DNS queries, which
is how we managed to identify the AD domains of 23 targeted organizations just by analyzing
SUNBURST DNS queries.
Stage 2 DNS Request Structure
The structure of the SUNBURST DNS queries in Stage 1 is pretty well described by Prevasio
and Symantec, so we will not cover those in this blog post. Instead we will focus specifically
on the structure of the DNS queries transmitted in Stage 2 operation, where the clients
request a CNAME record from the name server.
As we have explained previously the exfiltrated data gets base32 encoded, using the custom
alphabet "ph2eifo3n5utg1j8d94qrvbmk0sal76c", in order to ensure that only valid domain
name characters are used in the DNS beacons.
The structure of the Stage 2 request, before it gets base32 encoded and appended as an
avsvmcloud.com subdomain, looks like this:
Field

Size

Description

3/7

XOR Key

8 bits

A value between 0x01 and 0x7F used to XOR encrypt the rest of
the data.

GUID

64 bits

Client ID encrypted using 16 bit rotating XOR with the last 15 bits
of Timestamp and the Stage 2 flag.

Packet Type

4 bits

A value of 0x1, could in theory be 0x2 but that's very unlikely.

Timestamp

19 bits

Number of 30 minute periods since start of 2010 (UTC).

Stage 2 Flag

1 bit

A flag set to "1" in Stage 2 operation, otherwise "0".

The base32 encoding not only uses a custom alphabet, it also employs a reversed
endianess and byte order compared to "normal" implementations. We have created a
CyberChef recipe that performs this custom base32 decoding, so that the structure can be
verified more easily. A list with 45 different Stage 2 avsvmcloud.com subdomains can be
found in our Finding Targeted SUNBURST Victims with pDNS blog post. Feel free to replace
the input to our CyberChef recipe with any of those subdomains.
Sleep Timers
The DNS responses from the name server not only controls how the SolarWinds backdoor
should transition between the various stages, it also controls for how long the backdoor
should wait before sending the next DNS beacon.
The delay is assigned by AND-ing the last octet of the received IP address with bitmask
0x54. The result from the AND operation is then used to select a sleep interval in the table
below, within which the client picks a random number of minutes to sleep.
AND Result

Name

Sleep Interval

0x00

1 hour

30-120 minutes
4/7

0x04

4 hours

240-300 minutes

0x10

8 hours

480-600 minutes

0x14

1 day

1440-1560 minutes

0x40

3 days

4320-5760 minutes

0x44

1 week

10020-10140 minutes

0x50

2 weeks

20100-20220 minutes

0x54

1 month

43140-43260 minutes

An exception to the table above is clients that have entered Stage 2, which will only wait one
to three minutes before requesting a CNAME.
Example DNS C2 for a Non-Targeted Client
Below is an example of DNS queries and responses from a SUNBURST client that wasn't
targeted by the threat actors. These particular queries and responses come from a post on
SolarWinds' community forum.

Query: if9prvp9o36mhihw2hrs260g12eu1 ⇒ AD domain "omeros.local"
Response: 8.18.145.139 ⇒ sleep 1h, then Continue
2020-07-04 01:08 UTC
Query: hnhb3v1b37dvv09icg0edp0 ⇒ Carbon Black is running

Note: Queried domain names in this list are subdomains of appsync-api.eu-west1.avsvmcloud.com.
Example DNS C2 for a Targeted Client

5/7

Disclaimer: We have very few DNS queries and responses for targeted victims, hence the
transactions below are improvised based on data from VriesHd, Joe Słowik and FireEye.
Please view these transactions as an example of what the communication might look like for
a targeted victim rather than what actually happened to this particular target.
2020-06-11 04:00 UTC
Query: r8stkst71ebqgj66ervisu10bdohu0gt ⇒ AD domain, part 1 "central.pima.g"
Response: 8.18.144.1 ⇒ Sleep 1h, then Continue
2020-06-11 05:00 UTC
Query: ulfmcf44qd58t9e82w ⇒ AD domain, part 2 "ov"
Response: 8.18.144.2 ⇒ Sleep 1h, then Continue
2020-06-11 06:00 UTC

Note: Queried domains in this list are subdomains of appsync-api.us-west2.avsvmcloud.com.
Conclusions
We hope this blog post clears up any misunderstandings regarding the targeting process of
the SolarWinds backdoor and highlights the significance of the Stage 2 flag.
