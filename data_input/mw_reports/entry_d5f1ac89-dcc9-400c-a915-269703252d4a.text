At least 60 devices and internet routers were compromised in Alaska
ANCHORAGE – An Estonian national pleaded guilty today in the District of Alaska to two
counts of computer fraud and abuse.
According to court documents, Pavel Tsurkan, 33, operated a criminal proxy botnet by
remotely accessing and compromising more than 1,000 computer devices and internet
routers worldwide, including at least 60 victims in Alaska. He used the victims’ devices to
build and operate an Internet of Things (IoT)-based botnet dubbed the “Russian2015” using
the domain Russian2015.ru. He modified the operation of each compromised internet router
so it could be used as a proxy to transmit third-party internet traffic without the owners’
knowledge or consent. He then sold access to global cybercriminals who channeled their
traffic through the victims’ home routers, using the victims’ devices to engage in spam
campaigns and other criminal activity. The Alaska victims experienced significant data
overages even when there were no home computers connected to the victims’ home
networks. The data overages resulted in hundreds to thousands of dollars per victim.

“Today’s cybercriminals rely on increasingly sophisticated techniques to hijack computers
and personal electronic devices for their criminal activities. Botnets like the ‘Russian2015’
are a dangerous threat to all Americans and today’s guilty plea demonstrates we can and will
hold accountable foreign cybercriminals and their enablers,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Bryan
Wilson, District of Alaska. “Our success in disrupting this botnet was the result of a strong
partnership between private industry experts and law enforcement.”
Tsurkan is scheduled to be sentenced on November 10, 2021 and faces a maximum penalty
of 10 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after
considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The FBI’s Anchorage Field Office is investigating the case with support from GCI and Palo
Alto Networks Unit 42. The FBI’s New Haven, Connecticut, Field Office provided assistance
during the investigation.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Alexander and Trial Attorney Alden Pelker of the Criminal
Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case.
