COVID Omicron Variant Lure Used to Distribute RedLine
Stealer

January 10, 2022

Just like the previous year, 2021 ended with COVID and 2022 started with the same. The
only difference is that the world is now dealing with the new Omicron variant rather than the
Delta variant, which emerged in April 2021. While reportedly less lethal than its predecessor,
the Omicron variant has a much higher transmission rate, and as a result, daily counts of
new Omicron patients have become a global concern. This has renewed heightened concern
about the pandemic, and as we have all sadly learned, threat actors don’t shy away from
using misery and fear to their advantage.
FortiGuard Labs recently came across a curiously named file, “Omicron Stats.exe”, which
turned out to be a variant of Redline Stealer malware. This blog will look at the Redline
Stealer malware, including what’s new in this variant, its core functions, how it communicates
with its C2 server, and how organizations can protect themselves.

RedLine Stealer
Before talking specifics on this new RedLine Stealer variant, let’s review what we know about
RedLine Stealer in general.
The first reports of RedLine Stealer go back to at least March of 2020 and it quickly became
one of the more popular infostealers sold in underground digital markets. The Information
harvested by RedLine Stealer is sold on the dark net marketplace for as low as 10 US dollars
per set of user credentials. The malware emerged just as the world began to deal with
increased numbers of COVID patients and the growing fear and uncertainty that can cause
people to lower their guard, which may have prompted its developers to use COVID as its
lure.
According to the CIA, open source intelligence, or OSINT, is intelligence “drawn from publicly
available material,” although it can include sources only available to specialists or
subscribers. Based on the global OSINT information collected and analyzed by FortiGuard
Labs, the current Redline Stealer includes the following functionalities.
Normally, these are the victims whose systems have been infected with any of the abovementioned stealers, due to which victim have unknowingly had their account passwords and
full browser details recorded, and then sent to marketplace operators. Generally, in such
cases, each user profile includes login credentials for accounts on online payment portals, ebanking services, file-sharing or social networking platforms. As such, it attempts to collect
the following information from browsers installed on the compromised machine, including all
Chromium-based browsers and all browsers based on Gecko (i.e. Mozilla):
1. Stored system information:
1. Login and passwords
2. Cookies
3. Auto-Fill Forms
4. Browser User Agent Details
5. Credit Card information
6. Browser history
2. Installed FTP clients
3. Installed IM clients
4. It also engages in highly configurable information collection based on file path and file
extension, including searching in subfolders.
5. It sets up a blacklist of countries where Redline Stealer will not function
2/9

6. It also collects the following machine information
1. IP
2. Country
3. City
4. Current user name
5. Hardware ID
6. Keyboard layouts
7. Screenshot
8. Screen resolution
9. Operating system
10. UAC settings
11. User-Agent
12. Information about PC components such as video cards and processors
13. Installed antivirus solution
14. Data/Files from common folders such as desktop/downloads, etc.
The current variant continues to perform all these functions. However, this new version
includes additional changes and improvements, which are detailed below:

Infection vector for the RedLine Stealer variant (Omicron Stats.exe)
While we have not been able to identify the infection vector for this particular variant, we
believe that it is being distributed via email. Past RedLine Stealer variants are known to have
been distributed in COVID-themed emails to lure victims. The file name of this current
variant, “Omicron Stats.exe,” was used just as the Omicron variant was becoming a global
concern, following the pattern of previous variants. And given that this malware is embedded
in a document designed to be opened by a victim, we have concluded that email is the
infection vector for this variant as well.

Victimology
Based on the information collected by FortiGuard Labs, potential victims of this RedLine
Stealer variant are spread across 12 countries. This indicates that this is a broad-brush
attack and that the threat actors did not target specific organizations or individuals.

Functionality
Once Omicron Stats.exe is executed, it unpacks resources encrypted with triple DES using
ciphermode ECB and padding mode PKCS7. Unpacked resources are then injected into
vbc.exe. It copies itself to C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\chromedrlvers.exe and
creates the following scheduled task for persistence:
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn "Nania" /tr
"'C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\chromedrlvers.exe'" /f

The malware then attempts to exfiltrate the following system information from Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI):
Graphics card name
BIOS manufacturer, identification code, serial number, release date and version
Disk drive manufacturer, model, total heads and signature
Processor (CPU) information like unique ID, processor ID, manufacturer, name, max
clock speed and motherboard information
The malware also decrypts strings with base64 and xor key "Margented." The decrypted
strings are "freelancer.com" and 207[.]32.217.89. It then accesses a Command and Control
(C2) server (207[.]32[.]217[.]89:14588). It uses a unique header ,"Authorization:
ns1=d8cc092a9e22f3fc55d63aad32150529" to verify itself, and the decrypted ID
“freelancer.com” to prevent connections from other malware or researchers.

The malware searches for the following strings on the compromised machine to locate
relevant folders for data exfiltration:
wallet.dat (information related to cryptocurrency)
wallet (information related to cryptocurrency)
Login Data
Web Data
Cookies
Opera GX Stable
Opera GX

The malware also looks for the following files for data exfiltration:
\Telegram Desktop\tdata folder, which Telegram stores images and conversations.
%appdata%\discord\Local Storage\leveldb, which stores Discord channel and channelspecific information that a user has joined, for the following files:
.log and .db files
Files that match the following regular expression: [A-Za-z\d]{24}\.[\w-]{6}\.[\w-]{27}
[A-Z] is a regular expression used to search for files with names using any upper case
alphabet from A-Z
[a-z] is a regular expression used to search for files with names using any lower case
alphabets from a-z
\d is a regular expression used to search for any digits

4/9

{24} is a regular expression used to match the previous tokens exactly 24 times
\. Is a regular expression used to find “.” (\ is an escape)
\w is a regular expression used to find any word characters that include underscore
Tokens.txt (used for Discord access)

The malware also looks for and attempts to steal the following stored browser data:
Login Data
Web Data
Browser User Agent Details
Cookies
Extension Cookies
Autofill
Credit Card information
The malware also attempts to collect the following system information:
Processors
Graphics cards
Total of RAM
Installed programs
Running processes
Installed languages
Username
Installed Windows version
Serial number
The RedLine Stealer variants steals stored credentials for the following VPN applications:
NordVPN
OpenVPN
ProtonVPN

C2 Infrastructure
This variant uses 207[.]32.217.89 as its C2 server through port 14588. This IP is owned by
1gservers. Over the course of the few weeks after this variant was released, we noticed one
IP address in particular communicating with this C2 server. Some telemetry data is shown
below.

This 149[.]154.167.91 IP address is located in Great Britain and is part of the Telegram
Messenger Network. It seems that the C2 server may be controlled by the Redline operators
through an abused Telegram messaging service. This conclusion is not a huge leap as the
malware author(s) offer both dedicated purchasing and support lines through their respective
Telegram groups.

Conclusion
RedLine Stealer takes advantage of the ongoing COVID crisis and is expected to continue
that trend. While it is not designed to have a catastrophic effect on the compromised
machine, the information that it steals can be used for malicious actions by the same
cybercriminal or sold to another threat actor for future activities. Stay outside of the red zone
by exercising basic security practices, detailed below:
