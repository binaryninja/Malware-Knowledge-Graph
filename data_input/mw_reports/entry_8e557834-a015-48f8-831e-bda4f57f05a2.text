Fighting cyberweapons built by private businesses

A world where private sector companies manufacture and sell cyberweapons is more
dangerous for consumers, businesses of all sizes and governments. We take this threat
seriously and have disrupted the use of certain cyberweapons manufactured and sold by a
group we call Sourgum. The weapons disabled were being used in precision attacks
targeting more than 100 victims around the world including politicians, human rights activists,
journalists, academics, embassy workers and political dissidents. To limit these attacks, we
focused on two actions. First, we built protections into our products against the unique
malware Sourgum created, and we shared those protections with the security community.
Second, we issued a software update that will protect Windows customers from exploits
Sourgum was using to help deliver its malware. We’ve undertaken this work in close
collaboration with the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School.
We believe Sourgum is an Israel-based private sector offensive actor or PSOA. Citizen Lab
has identified the group as a company called Candiru. Sourgum generally sells
cyberweapons that enable its customers, often government agencies around the world, to
hack into their targets’ computers, phones, network infrastructure and internet-connected
devices. These agencies then choose who to target and run the actual operations
themselves.
We initially started this work after receiving a tip from Citizen Lab about malware used by
Sourgum. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Security
Response Center (MSRC) spent weeks examining the malware, documenting how it works
1/2

and building protections that can detect and neutralize it. We named the malware
DevilsTongue. We’ve built protections against DevilsTongue into our security products, and
we’ve shared these protections with others in the security community so they can protect
their customers. Technical information for customers and the security community is available
here.
By examining how Sourgum’s customers were delivering DevilsTongue to victim computers,
we saw they were doing so through a chain of exploits that impacted popular browsers and
our Windows operating system. Earlier this week, we released updates that, when installed,
protect Windows customers from two key Sourgum exploits.
These attacks have largely targeted consumer accounts, indicating Sourgum’s customers
were pursuing particular individuals. The protections we issued this week will prevent
Sourgum’s tools from working on computers that are already infected and prevent new
infections on updated computers and those running Microsoft Defender Antivirus as well as
those using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
This is part of broader legal, technical and advocacy work we’re undertaking to address the
dangers caused when PSOAs build and sell weapons. As we’ve previously said, these
companies increase the risk that weapons fall into the wrong hands and threaten human
rights. That’s why, for example, we filed an amicus brief in a legal case brought by WhatsApp
against another PSOA called NSO Group.
As we increase our work to identify PSOAs and disrupt the capabilities of their weapons, we
will continue to identify them using the names given to trees and shrubs, as we’ve done with
Sourgum. This is similar to how we use elements of the periodic table to name nation-state
actor groups we have identified.
We’re grateful to Citizen Lab for sharing the malware that sparked this work and for its offer
to work with potential victims of these attacks.
