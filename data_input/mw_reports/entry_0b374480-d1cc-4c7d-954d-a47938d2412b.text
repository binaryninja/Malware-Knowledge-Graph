Seems Phishy: Back to School Lures Target University Students and Staff

2/10

September 05, 2019 Michael Walsh and the Proofpoint Threat Insight Team

Overview
Every school year, Proofpoint researchers observe a seasonal uptick in college-themed
phishing, especially between June and October, as students prepare for school and near the
beginning of the fall term. A typical university phishing campaign is medium volume
(thousands or tens of thousands of messages per day). Campaigns are typically not
geographically targeted, but rather tied to specific universities with phishing templates
developed for library and student management portals. While many of the examples here are
from schools in the United States, we regularly observe campaigns affecting hundreds of
universities worldwide.
Threat actors distribute messages that contain links or HTML attachments that direct victims
to cloned university login portals. These portals incorporate stolen branding, accurate street
addresses, and other social engineering techniques to manipulate users into disclosing login
credentials.
The fraudulent webpages range in complexity and accuracy compared to the original, but
many are indistinguishable from their genuine counterparts. We included several examples
of these fake login pages below:

Delivery
The emails that lead recipients to these phishing portals frequently contain either: (1) HTML
attachments with URLs that link to the fraudulent login page, or (2) embedded URLs that link
directly to the spoofed portal. The malicious attachments often have generic file names
including “new_attached.html”, “ fafsa_2018.pdf”, or “new_rule.html”, some of which, like the
Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) PDF example, will resonate particularly
with students.
After entering their login credentials into the fraudulent login page, victims are often
redirected to the genuine university login portal, at which point it simply appears that the
login attempt failed. The stolen credentials are then sent to an external site controlled by the
attacker, saved in a text file on the same server to be retrieved later, or emailed to inboxes
that are controlled by the phisher.

Silent Librarian
TA407, also known as Silent Librarian, is another notable threat for students. The group was
indicted by the FBI for its spear phishing campaigns that impersonate university library
administration in order to phish for students' login credentials. Ultimately, the group uses
these credentials to steal and resell intellectual property, journal subscription credentials, and
more.
TA407 primarily targets universities and higher education institutions within the US with lowvolume (hundreds or thousands of messages), highly personalized campaigns. These
campaigns utilize well-crafted social engineering mechanisms including:
Stolen branding
Fake email signatures/credentials/addresses
Personalized email bodies/portal clones
Themed subject lines (e.g., “Renewal of loaned items”, “Renew your loaned items”, and
“Renewal of materials”)
Since the beginning of 2019, Proofpoint researchers observed several TA407 campaigns
distributing phishing campaigns with clones of university library login pages. Although TA407
has made minor variations to its social engineering techniques and infrastructure, their
strategies have been rather consistent. Many of these campaigns use the same lures with
minor variations in phrasing.
A typical message contains a brief message that warns the student about overdue library
materials or outdated library login credentials. The following figures are message bodies
excerpted from recent Silent Librarian campaigns:

The URLs in these messages link to cloned university login portals that use stolen branding
and lookalike domains to manipulate recipients into disclosing their login credentials. After
submitting credentials, victims are often redirected to the actual university library login page,
leaving no indication that their information had just been phished.
The group is also known for leveraging local events and alerts to add legitimacy to their lures
and time attacks to periods during which security and IT staffing may be minimal as shown in
Figure 8.

Conclusion
Phishing is one of the most prevalent types of threats that Proofpoint observes. Collectively,
phishing campaigns account for millions of messages per year. Threat actors use stolen
branding and other social engineering mechanisms to manipulate victims into disclosing
personal data or login credentials. Phished credentials often serve as the foundation for
business email compromise, which is difficult to detect because affected accounts are
legitimate.
TA407/Silent Librarian has proved to be a notable threat in the phishing landscape, using low
volume, highly targeted, socially engineered campaigns to steal students’ login credentials.
These campaigns affect hundreds of universities in the US.
Significantly, recent Proofpoint research revealed that the education sector is particularly
vulnerable to attacks on cloud services with the highest success rates for unauthorized login
attempts of any industry. This demonstrates the value of stolen credentials to threat actors
and the broad attack surface inherent in university environments.
As a recommendation to mitigate these risks, we advise universities to:

9/10

Implement comprehensive antivirus/anti-phishing services
Instruct students on how to recognize malicious emails
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) in university email systems, client devices,
and application portals
Advise their students and faculty on how to:
Recognize malicious emails that often rely on similar social engineering
techniques
Avoid emails that contain typical indications of malicious intent:
Spelling mistakes
Grammatical issues
Unsolicited requests for information
Suspicious links that may spoof reputable domains
Report suspected malicious emails to the university IT department
Avoid interacting with suspicious messages, especially ones that request
personal information or prompt the student to log in to a university service
Be aware of potential phishing attacks when threat actors, including TA407, are
most active:
September-November (Beginning of school year)
January-February (return from winter break)
April-June (conclusion of the school year)
