Executive Summary
Redline Stealer, which is currently being distributed, has changed the C2 communication
method and the way of delivering the collected information from the previous Redline Stealer,
but the overall execution flow is the same.
Redline Stealer has hard-coded encoded data such as C2 Server IP and Unique ID, and the
XOR Key required to decode this data. When Redline is executed, the value is extracted first.
After that, the information is collected and leaked by referring to the configuration data received

from the C2 server, and the collected information is composed of Environment Details and
Credential Details. The collected information includes system information, browser credentials,
crypto wallet information, FTP information, Telegram and Discord information, etc.
After collecting and leaking information, Redline Stealer also has the ability to download
executable files and perform additional malicious actions.

Introduction of Redline Stealer
Since its release in February 2020, Redline Stealer has been delivered through various
channels. Redline Stealer is mostly distributed through Phishing Emails or malicious software
disguised as installation files such as Telegram, Discord, and cracked software. However,
recently, Phishing Link that downloads Chrome Extension containing Redline Stealer by
abusing is utilized, or Python Script that runs Redline Stealer through FTP is being distributed.

Redline Stealer Execution Flow
1. The attachment in phishing mail contains cracked software with Redline Stealer.
2. When the cracked software is executed, Redline Stealer is also executed in the
background.
3. Encoded data such as C2 Server IP and Unique ID are decoded along with the XOR key
and used for C2 communication.
4. After finishing the decoding process, Redline Stealer requests configuration data from the
C2 Server.
Entity2: a structure that stores configuration data.
5. The C2 Server transmits configuration data to the infected PC.
6. Information is collected from the infected PC referring to stored configuration data.
Entity7: a structure that stores collected results. (Environment Details + Entity1)
Entity1: a structure that stores Credential Details.
7. The information is leaked twice.
Environment Details including infected PC information
Credential Details including crypto wallet, accounts, and user data information
8. Collected information is converted into XML format and transmitted to the C2 Server through
SOAP Message.

Redline Stealer Execution Flow

Configuration of C2 Communication
Redline Stealer with WCF
The framework Redline Stealer uses for C2 communication is WCF(Windows Communication
Foundation). WCF is a system that allows endpoints to exchange messages and communicate
across multiple computers connected to the network.

13/29

At least one endpoint must be configured to use WCF. When configuring the endpoint, three
elements are required: Address, Binding,and Contract. ‘Address’ is the address providing the
service, ‘Binding’ is the information related to the communication protocol used to access the
service, and ‘Contract’ defines the service interface. The WCF Client can call the service
defined as Service Contract, and when a specific method is called, a method of the same name
implemented in the server is called. [ServiceContract] keyword, a service interface, is used to
define the contract, [DataContract] keyword is used to define a data structure to be transmitted,
and [OperationContract] keyword is used to define the function of the service.

WCF Communication

14/29

The previous Redline Stealer used BasicHTTPBinding() for communication. However, from
Redline Stealer v22 updated in August 2020, the communication protocol was changed to
NetTcpBinding(). NetTcpBinding() has a performance advantage compared to
BasicHTTPBinding() because SOAP messages are binary encoded and delivered.
Redline Stealer collects information by specifying a Service Contract named Entity and defines
24 Operation Contracts and 17 Data Contracts. When a method defined as Operation Contract
is called from an infected PC to the C2 Server, a method of the same name implemented on the
C2 Server is called. At this time, ‘Entity7 result’ is delivered to the C2 Server.

WCF Service Call/Response
Decoding C2 Server and Unique ID

15/29

In Redline Stealer, the encoded C2 Server address and Unique ID are hard-coded. Therefore,
when the malware is executed, they are decoded and used for C2 communication.

17/29

Redline Stealer has a Service Contract named Entity, 17 Data Contracts that define the
structure to store information, and 24 Operation Contracts that define the functionality of the
service. Among them, the description of the Data Contract storing information is shown in the
table below.
(*Functional descriptions for each Operation Contract are described in Appendix.)

Data Contract List
Try to connect
After configuring the endpoint, Redline Stealer tries to connect with the C2 Server and receives
the response. Redline Stealer periodically checks whether it maintains a connection with the C2
Server during execution.

Configuration Data Request/Receive
Request configuration data

18/29

The Redline Stealer requests configuration data that specifies what information to collect, and
includes the paths and keywords required to collect browser and local file information, and the
name of crypto wallets to be explored.
Response configuration data
The configuration data is stored in Entity2 and used to collect information to be leaked. The
configuration data consists of Flag indicating whether each item is collected and Setting
indicating paths and keywords for collecting files.

Collected information
19/29

Way to collect and store information
The information collected from the infected PC is stored in Entity7. Entity7 includes
Environment Details and Entity1, and Entity1 separately stores Credential Details information.
Each item in Entity1 uses the structure of Entity3~Entity5, Entity8~Entity12, and Entity14 to
store related information. At this time, Entity1 may or may not be used depending on Redline
Stealer’s information leakage mode.

A structure of Entity7
Way to leak information
Redline Stealer defines two ways to leak information.

20/29

(Default)
The “Send Log by Parts” is a method of collecting information from the infected PC and then
partially leaking it. That is, the collected ‘Environment Details’ are first leaked to the C2 Server
by putting it in Entity7. In this case, each item of Entity1 is stored empty. After that, ‘Credential
Details’ are collected, but not stored in Entity1 and immediately leaked after being collected by
the item.

Send Log by Parts Flow
This method stores all the collected information in Entity7 and leaks it. First, ‘Environment
Details’ are collected and stored in Entity7. Credential Details are then collected and stored in
Entity1. If Environment Details and Entity1 are filled in Entity7, it is leaked to the C2 Server.
21/29

Send Log by Full-Flow
The biggest difference between the two methods is whether Entity1 is used or not. Environment
Details and Entity1 collected from the infected PC are stored in Entity7, while Entity1 stores
Credential Details. In the “Send Log by Full” method, Entity1 is used to leak information at once,
but in the “Send Log by Parts” method, Entity1 is not used and each item of Credential Details
is leaked as soon as it is collected.
What method Redline Stealer uses can be checked through the “Version” value among hardcoded data. If the version is 1, “Send Log by Parts” method is used, and in other cases, “Send
Log by Full” method is used. In the case of the sample, since the version is set to 1, the “Send

22/29

Log by Parts” method can be seen, which partially leaks the collected information to be used.
Therefore, among the collected information, Credential Details is collected for each item and
then leaked immediately.
Collect Environment Details
Device information of the infected PC is collected and stored in Entity7.
Entity7 includes hardware information, Unique ID, machine name, OS information, available
languages, monitor information, IPv4, the malware file location, Redline Stealer infection
history, and monitor screenshots where each item of Credential Details (Entity1) excluding
monitor screenshots is stored empty.
Leak Environment Details
Environment Details stored in Entity7 result prepares to access service via Id6() method.
Thereafter, the collected information is leaked by calling the defined [OperationContract] Id4()
method. Upon receiving the leaked information, the C2 Server sends a response to the infected
PC, which is stored and delivered in Entity13. The response type can be divided into
Unknown(Entity13.Id1), Success(Entity13.Id2), RepeatPart(Entity13.Id3),
NotFound(Entity13.Id4)

23/29

Preparing to leak information

(Left) / Leaked information after accessing service (Right)
Collect & Leak Credential Details
‘Credential Details’ are leaked whenever one item is collected. The information leakage process
is the same as ‘Environment Details’ leakage process, but there is a difference in the
information delivered to the C2 Server. Each item of Credential Details is leaked by calling the

24/29

matched [OperationContract] Id#() method. When the C2 Server receives information, it sends
a response to the infected PC, which is the same type of response it receives when
Environment Details is leaked.

25/29

Result: Collected Information
Targets collected by Redline Stealer are largely divided into infection device information,
installation information, crypto wallet information, account information, User Data information,
and local file information. In the case of crypto wallet information, in addition to the crypto wallet
list specified in configuration data, the installed Browser Extension Wallet list is checked to
collect related information. The table summarizing the collected information by type is as
follows.

Summarizing of collected information by type

Conclusion
Redline Stealer is one of the most popular infostealers along with Vidar, Raccoon, and
Ficker.
Logs stolen through Redline Stealer are the most traded logs on DDW Forums.
26/29

Redline Stealer has been updating versions until recently, and continuous analysis is
needed in that the structure of Redline Stealer is gradually changing according to major
updates.
