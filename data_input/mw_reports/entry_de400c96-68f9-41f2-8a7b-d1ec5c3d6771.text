Introduction
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks were on the rise in 2018, ranging from a high
volume of Mirai attacks to more sophisticated botnets targeting enterprises. An example of
these attacks is the one targeting GitHub in February 2018, forcing the website to go offline
for approximately 10 minutes.
In researching the current DDoS ecosystem we find threat actors from different regions
displaying different motivations. Chinese threat actors in particular have predominantly
deployed DDoS attacks in their cyber campaigns, and China has emerged as having one of
the highest rates of DDoS attacks.
In this blog we will discuss the current state of a well-known Chinese threat actor group
known as ChinaZ, notorious for targeting Windows and Linux systems with DDoS botnets
since November 2014.
We will explain how we first came across ChinaZ, along with the various methods employed
to discover more of the group‚Äôs servers. Additionally, we will analyze the types of files
hosted on the servers and conclude with a technical analysis highlighting potential
connections that could relate various Chinese actors in the current DDoS landscape such
as Nitol, MrBlack and some minor relations to Iron Tiger APT. These relationships will be
discussed in the technical analysis section.

Initial ChinaZ Discovery via Honeypot Hit

2/35

In the last few months we have observed a higher volume of attacks from Billgates, a DDoS
botnet attributed to ChinaZ, a well-known Chinese threat actor notorious for deploying a
series of botnets primarily targeting Linux systems.

ChinaZ was fairly active in 2018 based on previous hits that were encountered in our
honeypots. An example of an attack vector via SSH/Telnet bruteforce employed by ChinaZ
can be seen in the following session log from one of our honeypots:

The downloader bash script seems to be fairly simple in logic by changing directories from
/root to /tmp once it detected that the dropped implant could not be executed after several
attempts changing its file permissions.
Once we accessed where the script was trying to download its corresponding files we found
that there were files being hosted in a Chinese Http File Server (HFS) panel. The following
is a screenshot of this panel:
3/35

We discovered the server was online for less than 24 hours, and that all of the files were
uploaded on that same day. We decided to observe this and other servers and conduct a
tracking investigation with the intention to collect all of the information we could about the
botnet infrastructure.
Observing ChinaZ
ChinaZ is known to use Chinese Http File Server (HFS) instances, and unlike other major
DDoS botnets such as Mirai, ChinaZ operates mostly on Windows Servers. In this particular
HFS server we see various hosted files. The two Linux prefixed files are both regular
Billgates builds. We can confirm this based on code reused from other samples:

4/35

https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/5442438f-fe2e-478a-bbbe-0ee6dde39df7
Since BillGates is a well-known botnet and there are plenty of well-written technical analysis
articles about the botnet and its relations to ChinaZ, we have decided to not cover its
technical analysis for the sake of simplicity. These builds are default BillGates instances.
Both of these instances share the same CNC domain which is the following:

Among the hosted files in the HFS server we can also find a PE executable labeled as
BX.exe, which is a Gh0st RAT variant.
Furthermore, this Gh0st RAT instance decodes the same CNC address:

5/35

Since both BillGates and the Gh0st RAT instances found in the initially discovered HFS
panel shared the same CNC, we can associate both implants to be components of a single
botnet targeting both Linux and Windows systems. This same scenario was presented by
Avast researchers as the Chinese Chicken DDoS botnets by exposing a series of multiplatform Chinese DDoS tools.
After one day threat actors behind this botnet updated the HFS panel by uploading two
ChinaZ.DDoSClient samples compiled for x86 and x86_64 systems accordingly.

6/35

The following is a code reuse analysis of these new samples:

https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/6a088a5e-4630-427b-b8de-806e633a1ccc
DDoSClient malware is a DDoS client known to be leveraged by ChinaZ. As an interesting
fact about the progression of this threat actor group, at some point in time the source code
of this client was hosted in GitHub, although DDosClient was originally code of ChinaZ.
MalwareMustDie exposed this source code and the actor‚Äôs identity. The actor behind this
client was a student hired by ChinaZ.
Furthermore, we can find a compressed archive labeled as ‚ÄòBlack Wolf Linux Blasting V4.0‚Äô
in Chinese among the different binaries hosted in the HFS server. Inside this RAR file we
encounter the following files:

7/35

Most interestingly, the contents of this compressed file appear to be a Chinese DDoS tool:

8/35

9/35

The tool enables users to edit which files will be used on deployment, and other related
configurations such as the time out. We observed this specific DDoS tool advertised in a
range of Chinese forums:

If we analyze one of the scripts inside the zip file and compare it with our initial honeypot hit
log, we can assume that the attack was deployed using this tool:

10/35

We are not sure whether this Chinese DDoS tool was distributed by ChinaZ, or if the group
purchased this tool in order to use it in its campaigns.
The server was online for one more day before it went offline. This behavior suggests that
actors behind this botnet may have migrated to a different CNC server, they were
performing some internal management, or that it was merely part of the way they operate
since we have seen this same behavior tracking their other servers.

Hunting for Additional ChinaZ Servers

11/35

We decided to look up the specific CNC domain name seen in the BillGates and Gh0st RAT
instances found in the initial HFS server, to see if this domain had multiple resolutions in
order to find more potential servers linked to this botnet. When we searched the domain on
RiskIQ we found the following:

All of the shown IPs in the previous screenshot denote a server that would resolve to ‚Äúak74.top‚Äù, the CNC address seen in the first HFS server. Based on these resolutions we were
able to find other panels like the following:

12/35

We instantly recognize the same pattern in terms of the naming convention as well as the
types of files that were hosted in this HFS server. In contrast with the previous HFS server,
this server is only hosting Windows binaries and a zip file.
The 7z compressed file contained the following files:

These files appear to be composing a Port Scanner tool written in python that could also be
used to deploy DDoS attacks.

13/35

In the screenshot above we can observe an executable responsible for the main TCP/SYN
flood, and the script used to deploy DDoS attacks.
We also used Shodan to hunt for more operative ChinaZ HFS servers. We did this by
filtering Shodan‚Äôs query for the appropriate service and country.

14/35

Leveraging Shodan we were able to find many other ChinaZ linked servers, in which we
collected additional relevant samples. After we discovered several ChinaZ servers and we
collected their correspondent hosted files, we found interesting correlations and
relationships which we will discuss in the next section.

Technical Analysis
Throughout the investigation we found several interesting facts among the artifacts we
collected and analyzed. The following is a brief summary of our findings:
Gh0st RAT Clients:

15/35

The Gh0st RAT clients we discovered among several HFS servers all appear to be modified
instances of Gh0st RAT that share notable characteristics. These Gh0st RAT variants are
found hosted in different HFS servers with the names BX.exe or shadow.exe.
We can observe similarities in different functions from the open-source version hosted in
GitHub. The following is a brief comparison of both files‚Äô WinMain function:

Regarding this Gh0st RAT variant, if we take a closer look we observe that it has similarities
with the Gh0st RAT instance deployed on Operation PZCHAO by Iron Tiger APT, an APT
group with also alleged Chinese origin. The RC4 key used to decrypt the CNC is the same
as the one used in the PZCHAO campaign, ‚ÄúMother360‚Äù.

16/35

Based on a Bitdefender blog post about operation PZCHAO, this same cryptographic key
was not only used to decode the malware‚Äôs CNC addresses but also was the key used to
decrypt traffic between the client and the CNC.
We also see code similarities from both Gh0st RAT variants apart from the used RC4
function. The following code similarity comparisons are portions of the main function:

Although these two Gh0st RATs may share common code, it is important to understand how
to interpret these similarities. ChinaZ has been known to employ DDoS botnets in its
campaigns as previously mentioned. Usually APT groups do not rely on DDoS attacks.
These similarities may not necessarily correlate ChinaZ and Iron Tiger APT, but instead it
may be evidence of the existence of a common Gh0st RAT variant shared within the
Chinese community, by having the possibility to have ‚ÄòMother360‚Äô as one of the default
17/35

hard-coded keys. The reason for this interpretation is based on the fact that APT groups are
rarely involved with DDoS operations since the mere thought of correlating these two
models does not seem practical and the probability unlikely.
Infected Compressed Files with Nitol Artifacts:
Among some of the HFS panels found, we observed that some of the panels were hosting
DDoS tools.
Inside these compressed files we can see that they contain varying components. However,
among all of the files found in these compressed files, the most notable file was a DLL
labelled as lpk.dll that appeared in every hosted compressed archive that we found. This
DLL has been known to be hijacked in the past by Nitol, a Chinese DDoS botnet targeting
Windows systems that propagated infected trusted software by exploiting the Windows
Module Loading process. This was achieved by placing a malicious lpk.dll within the file
system meant to take precedence against the genuine lpk.dll on load-time since this DLL is
known to be loaded in every process by being a component of Microsoft Language Pack.

18/35

We can confirm this lpk.dll instance is the Nitol DLL from code reuse:

19/35

https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/da7374a4-1574-4986-aeda-c0ce567e4a4d
This finding may lead to different interpretations. One may directly link Nitol to ChinaZ and
argue that they are hosting infected compressed archives as a way to spread and
compromise systems. However, it is known that the Nitol botnet was seized by Microsoft in
2012, although there are reports that document Nitol activity from 2016 onwards.
Therefore, we can interpret this finding from a different standpoint, and raise the possibility
that actors behind this botnet are operating on infected physical Windows systems, and
consequently deploying malware infected with previous malware belonging to older
campaigns, therefore indirectly linking Nitol and ChinaZ.
In addition, as a fact supporting this theory was that after analysis, this specific DLL failed to
connect to its correspondent CNC, but at some point in the infection chain a parite file
infector was also dropped from both, the Nitol DLL implants as well as from the hosted
windows Gh0st RATs.

20/35

https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/47f52891-e2a3-4a9c-96b6-8184ce1c2e87
It is known that in 2010 there was a strong infection wave of Chinese servers that are still
operative deploying infected malware. This may be why we can find parite drops from files
hosted in these servers:

21/35

I'm pretty sure that it came from the worm wave in 2010. A lot of chinese server are
still infected. They build some malware (like gh0st) on pwned RDP/SMB servers and
the builded malware is "file infected" by ramnit
You can also found some Virut/Parite infection

üôÇ

‚Äî Benk√∏w mo ûu∆éq (@benkow_) February 8, 2018
It should be noted how minimal effort is shown from the actors to maintain a clean
development environment for their newer malware campaigns, if the theory explained
above is indeed true.
Further Connections between ChinaZ and Nitol:
MrBlack is an IoT botnet also known to have Windows variants. As documented by
MalwareMustDie, MrBlack is the simplified version of AES.DDoS, an ELF DDoS tool with
Chinese origin that was on circulation before ChinaZ was ever established. Therefore, there
are not direct correlations between MrBlack and ChinaZ.
However, we spotted MrBlack samples being hosted along with known ChinaZ malware. In
addition, if we analyze the results on string reuse of MrBlack samples, often we can see a
high volume of strings reused from ChinaZ malware.
Below is a code reuse analysis of the different files found in the following HFS server:

22/35

The following is the code reuse analysis of one of the hosted linux files, both of them being
ChinaZ.DdosClient:

https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/ab5e016c-288b-433e-aae4-a0120e55509b
The following is a code reuse analysis of the hosted windows binary demonstrating that the
file is a Win32/MrBlack instance:

23/35

https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/9ebd8c3d-2995-4bee-b5a7-6a8ae97854eb
We can see that this instance of MrBlack shares 10 genes with ServStart, a trojan
associated with the Nitol family. After analysis of these 10 genes we observed that this
instance of MrBlack shares the exact SYN flood function as in the ServStart instance.

24/35

We can observe that there are slight variations present throughout the code.

Most of the function is identical, specifically the main flood loop:

25/35

To reinforce this connection between MrBlack and ServStart, we discovered the following
panel:

26/35

In this panel we found two instances of Linux/MrBlack along with seven instances of a
variant of ServStart. We have identified the MrBlack instances based on code reuse:

https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/59ee92b0-3641-4ae0-a04e-7a4e0d21f5ce

27/35

Regarding the ServStart variants, we can see that they share a substantial amount of code
with respect to previous ServStart variants:

https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/5fa8efdc-49e7-41e9-bc69-173c23246fb1
It is important to note that these newer ServStart variants have a recent compilation time
stamp, and it was only submitted to VirusTotal one week ago from today:

28/35

We found several nearly identical functions reused from previous variants of ServStart. The
following is an example of one of these common functions.

29/35

Within the common code we found exact code fragments like the one below:

30/35

On the other hand, we found common code, although there are noticeable differences
between the new and old ServStart versions. An example of this is shown in the screenshot
below:

31/35

The relationships described above validate the previous linkage between Nitol and ChinaZ,
which could insinuate that these two threat actor groups may be related or may have
collaborated together. So far we have gathered the following links between them:
These two groups share the same goals in their campaigns with an emphasis on the
deployment of DDoS botnets.
Both groups have alleged Chinese origins.
A range of ChinaZ‚Äôs Windows clients have been infected by old Nitol artifacts.
These two families share relevant code with one another such as DDoS flood
implementations.
New ServStart variants have been spotted being hosted alongside with MrBlack Linux
instances.

Conclusion
We have covered how we have tracked ChinaZ and collected some up to date information
about this threat actor group. We have found potential connections that could relate various
Chinese actors in the current DDoS landscape.

32/35

ChinaZ is hosting instances of Linux and Windows builds of MrBlack, and Windows
versions have shown code reuse connections with old ServStart variants. Furthermore, we
have spotted newer versions of ServStart being hosted along with MrBlack Linux instances.
Therefore there may be a relationship between MrBlack and ServStart actors, indicating a
potential relationship between ChinaZ and Nitol families.
In addition, ChinaZ Windows components have been seen infected with Nitol components,
suggesting that these actors may have been operating in servers already infected with Nitol.
This enforces the hypothesis that there may be deeper relationships between these two
threat groups. ChinaZ has always been a relatively active threat actor group that is slowly
evolving in sophistication even though it is not making many changes to its overall
infrastructure from early stages. To reflect the most relevant relationships discussed in this
blog we have decided to present them with the following diagram:
