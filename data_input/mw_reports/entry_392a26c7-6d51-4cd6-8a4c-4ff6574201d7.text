Vawtrak and UrlZone Banking Trojans Target Japan

2/10

February 05, 2016 Proofpoint Staff
Overview
In January and February 2016, Proofpoint researchers observed threat actors spreading banking
Trojans in Japan and other countries that had not recently experienced high volumes of this family of
malware. These countries certainly have not been targeted previously in the same way as the UK,
United States, and others. Instead, it appears that the new campaigns in Japan (and Spain) are
continuations of the trend first observed with Shifu in October 2015. The key takeaways are:
The UrlZone banking Trojan is spreading via email spam and targeting Japanese and Spanish
banks
The Vawtrak Trojan is spreading using Angler Exploit Kit and targeting Japanese banks
Both Trojans are using the same dynamic injects system that allows them to manipulate a
financial institution’s website content (likely sharing resources or renting from the same third
party)
The injects system appears to be written by a Russian author
UrlZone Banking Trojan Campaigns
On January 21st of this year, Proofpoint researchers observed a large spam campaign consisting of
tens of thousands of emails targeting Japanese email accounts. Other researchers have also
observed an uptick in UrlZone activity in Japan but there are additional details behind this emerging
threat that are worth pointing out.
Emails with the subject “copy 3” from multiple Gmail accounts contained a zipped executables and
an empty email body. Proofpoint observation of actors such as those spreading Dridex over the past
year shows increasing use of very simple lure techniques like this throughout 2015. The simplicity
and lack of apparent ruse does not appear to hinder this technique: it is simple to create, requires no
imagination on the part of the actor, needs no localization, and may be sufficient to entice the user to
click.

The attachment utilized in this campaign is Andromeda. Andromeda is multi-purpose bot, but in this
case it is primarily used to download UrlZone. However, as is often the case in malware
ecosystems, Andromeda was also observed loading a plethora of additional malware.
UrlZone: a man-in-the-browser banking Trojan that has been around for several years
Pushdo Downloader: aside from adding the infected computer to a spam botnet, the loader
also downloaded a Neutrino Bot
Neutrino Bot: a multi-purpose bot capable of stealing passwords, DDoS, loading additional
payloads, etc. In this instance, it downloaded Pony for additional stealing.
Pony: primarily used for loading additional malware and stealing passwords and Bitcoin
wallets. This instance was used for its stealing capabilities.
It is also worth mentioning that Proofpoint observed a related large related Cryptowall campaign on
January 27, 2016. The Cryptowall downloaded the same Neutrino Bot that was present in the
UrlZone campaign. Also, on December 11, 2015, we observed an email campaign delivering the
same Andromeda botnet found in the UrlZone campaign, but in the December campaign,
Andromeda only downloaded Pushdo. The observations suggest that these campaigns are likely
connected by shared affiliates and/or spamming partners.

Vawtrak Banking Trojan Campaigns
While our colleagues at Sophos and Trend previously wrote about Vawtrak targeting Japan in 2014
and earlier, there are so far no documented campaigns of the updated Vawtrak Trojan targeting
Japan in 2015 or 2016. On February 2, 2016, however, we observed Angler EK delivering Vawtrak
ID 28 to Japanese users.

Dynamic Injects Shared by Vawtrak and UrlZone
After extracting the injects code from both Trojans we observed that there is an overlap in the
targeted banks. Both banking Trojans are using the same dynamic injects system that allows them
to manipulate a financial institution’s website content. This means that the two banking Trojans use
the same JavaScript code for stealing login credentials, PINs, one-time-passwords, etc. This could
also mean that the responsible actors are sharing resources or renting from the same third party.
Additionally, the injects JavaScript code appears to be written by a Russian developer, as observed
by code comments such as “Startuem nash interval na proverku statusa”, which translates to “Begin
our interval for checking the status”.

Conclusion
As others have noted, the emergence of banking Trojans in Japan and Spain presents some
particular challenges. While organizations in other countries like the UK and the United States have
been targets for massive Dridex, Dyre, Vawtrak (and other banking Trojans) campaigns and
businesses there have implemented a number of protections, countries with less experience
combatting these threats may find themselves vulnerable to considerable losses. Unfortunately, as
threat actors saturate targets in many geographies, it's only a matter of time until new geographies
begin experiencing the same sorts of volumes and persistence that characterize recent campaigns
with Dridex and other malware.
