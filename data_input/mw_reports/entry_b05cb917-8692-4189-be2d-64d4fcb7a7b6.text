Introduction
Last month, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported on EXOTIC LILY using file
transfer services like TransferNow, TransferXL, WeTransfer, or OneDrive to distribute
malware (link). Threat researchers like @k3dg3 occasionally report malware samples from
this activity. Based on @k3dg3's recent tweet, I searched through VirusTotal and found a
handful of active TransferXL URLs delivering ISO files for Bumblebee malware.
Today's diary reviews an infection generated from this activity on Wednesday 2022-05-18.

Shown above: Flow chart for infection discussed in this diary.
TransferXL URLs
TransferXL is a legitimate file sharing service. However, like other services with a cost-free
tier, TransferXL has been abused by criminals as a way to distribute malicious files.
However, with TransferXL, we have the benefit of seeing an email address used to share the
malicious file. The image below shows a malicious TransferXL URL recently submitted to
VirusTotal. Viewed in a web browser, it sends a malicious file. The associated email address
is jhurris@wolsleyindustrialgroup.com.

1/7

Shown above: Malicious TransferXL URL delivering malware.
The downloaded zip archive contains an ISO disk image. When double-clicked, this file is
mounted as a DVD drive. The ISO file contains a visible Windows shortcut and a hidden
malware DLL for Bumblebee. Double-clicking the Windows shortcut will run the hidden
malware DLL on a vulnerable Windows host.

2/7

Shown above: Downloaded ISO file mounted as a disk image containing Windows shortcut
and hidden malware DLL.
Traffic from an infection
After downloading malware from the malicious TransferXL URL, the infected host generated
Bumblebee C2 traffic to 194.135.33[.]144 over TCP port 443.

3/7

Shown above: Initial infection activity with Bumblebee C2 traffic filtered in Wireshark.
Approximately 15 minutes after the Bumblebee C2 traffic first appeared, the infected
Windows host generated HTTPS traffic to ec2-3-144-143-232-us-east2.compute.amazonaws[.]com on 3.144.143[.]242 over TCP port 443. The infected
host sent approximately 5.5 MB of data out and received approximately 4.0 MB of data back
from that server.

4/7

Shown above: Encrypted (HTTPS) traffic to an amazonAWS server.
Approximately 14 minutes after HTTPS traffic to the amazonAWS server, HTTPS Cobalt
Strike traffic appeared on 23.106.215[.]123 over TCP port 443 using xenilik[.]com as the
domain. It lasted approximately 3 minutes.

5/7

Shown above: Traffic from the infection showing Cobalt Strike activity.
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
TransferXL URLs associated with the above email returning zip archives containing
malicious ISO files.

Final words
As the Google TAG blog post notes, EXOTIC LILY is using this method to push Bumblebee
malware, and Bumblebee leads to further malware like Cobalt Strike. And Cobalt Strike has
been documented by different sources as leading to ransomware.
Today's diary reviewed a Bumblebee malware infection associated with EXOTIC LILY that
led to Cobalt Strike activity.
Pcap and malware samples associated with this infection are available here.
