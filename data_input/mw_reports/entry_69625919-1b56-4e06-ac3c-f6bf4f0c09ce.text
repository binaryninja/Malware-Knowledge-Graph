Links between ATMZOW JS-sniffer and Hancitor

Victor Okorokov
Group-IB lead Threat Intelligence analyst
The hacker group ATMZOW and its JavaScript-sniffer became known in 2020, thanks to the
Malwarebytes researchers, when the group installed a JS sniffer on a website that was
collecting donations for victims of the Australia bushfires.
However, based on a specific obfuscation technique used by the group, we can track its
activities back to 2015 as "Magento Guruincsite malware". Moreover, one of the first domain
names, used by the group, was created in 2016.
According to Group-IB Threat Intelligence data, ATMZOW has successfully infected at least
483 websites belonging to the domain zones of Italy, Germany, France, UK, Australia,

1/10

India, Brazil etc. since the beginning of 2019.

Group-IB specialists collected information about ATMZOW’s recent activity and found ties
with a phishing campaign targeting clients of a US bank based on the same JS obfuscation
technique and a connection between the domain names used for the JS sniffer and the
phishing domains on account of the same email address used. Further analysis showed that
the same phishing kit was used during the activity of Prometheus TDS, when an unknown
adversary used phishing pages as a final redirect when distributing Hancitor malware. With
moderate confidence, we can conclude that both the ATMZOW JS sniffer campaign and
related phishing attacks could have been conducted by the Hancitor group.
ATMZOW: recent activity
In May 2022 Group-IB specialists discovered that ATMZOW started using Google Tag
Manager (GTM) to deliver malicious payloads. Google Tag Manager is a tag management
system that allows website owners to quickly and easily update various code snippets known
as tags on websites and mobile apps.
The hackers created a Google Tag Manager link with ID GTM-WNV8QFR and started using
legitimate GTM code to inject JS sniffers. Injection starts with a common GTM snippet.

This GTM script contains a specific tag ("vtp_html") with the next stage injector.

Executing the script loaded by Google Tag Manager appends the injector to the DOM of the
infected website.

Figure 3: The attacker’s injector
The injector checks if the current user's address in the address bar contains a "checkout"
substring. If it does, the injector loads the final payload from
https://designestylelab[.]com/css/. The script loaded from
https://designestylelab[.]com/css/ is a sample of the ATMZOW JS sniffer, but it contains
an additional layer of obfuscation.

If we remove the junk symbols from the long string in this sample, we obtain a Base64encoded string. After decoding, we obtain an ATMZOW sample with its common obfuscation.

After decrypting the strings used in this sample, we obtain a clean script of the ATMZOW JS
sniffer.

Phishing campaign
In January 2022 Group-IB specialists detected several phishing pages targeting clients of a
US-based bank. The pages used IDN domain names. A noteworthy fact about the pages is
that they have a JavaScript script, which was presumably obfuscated by the same tool as
used by ATMZOW for the group’s samples of JS sniffers.

Since then we have detected only 7 unique domains used for phishing pages with a similar
obfuscated JS:

xn--kynavigatos-ky-pwc6541jna[.]com
navlgator-kcy[.]com

xn--key-vigatrs-key-wuc9688j1wa[.]com
xn--keyvigatrs-key-7oc4531jsva[.]com
Connection between the JS-sniffer and the phishing campaign
When we detected the same obfuscation technique on a phishing website for the first time,
we hypothesized that the method was not unique to ATMZOW, but that other hackers could
be using the same obfuscator. However, further analysis of the group's recent activity
showed additional evidence that attacks involving the JS sniffer and the phishing campaign
were conducted by the same group.
When ATMZOW started using Google Tag Manager as the initial stage of their infections,
they used a website with the domain name designestylelab[.]com as the storage location
for their payloads. With a patented technology named Group-IB Graph, we discovered that
this domain was created using the email address anne5lindt@winocs.com. The same email
address was used to create two more IDN domains for phishing pages targeting clients of
the same bank as the pages with the ATMZOW-like obfuscation, which we first detected in
January 2022:
kẹy-ņạvigatorkey.com (xn--ky-vigatorkey-kjc9383i4ka[.]com)
key-ņạvigatọrskey.com (xn--key-vigatrskey-8oc4531jsva[.]com)

In addition, one of these domains created with the email address anne5lindt@winocs.com
(xn--ky-vigatorkey-kjc9383i4ka[.]com) was tagged as a phishing page with ATMZOW-like
obfuscated JS script. It was detected on January 27, 2022.
Based on the same JS obfuscation technique and the connection between the domain
names used for the JS sniffer and the phishing domains (the same email address), we can
conclude with a high degree of reliability that both campaigns were conducted by the same
threat group.
Connection between the phishing campaign and Hancitor malware
While analyzing Prometheus TDS, Group-IB Threat Intelligence specialists detected several
cases when phishing pages targeting clients of the same bank were used as a final redirect
after downloading the malicious payload distributed by Prometheus TDS. In all cases, the

8/10

malicious payload was Microsoft Office documents with a macro that dropped Hancitor
malware.
For example, a common method of distribution via Prometheus TDS was the use of Google
Docs with a link to the compromised website with Prometheus.Backdoor installed. In this
case, the Prometheus.Backdoor link was hXXp://www.swingsidebilbao[.]com/wpcontent/plugins/contact-form-7/includes/block-editor/carl.php. If a user clicked on the link,
they would receive a malicious Office document "0210_4367220121562.doc" (SHA1:
be3effcb9069ac6d66256c8246fde33e55980403) and then would be redirected to the
phishing website hXXps://xn--keynvigatorkeyyp8g[.]com/ktt/cmd/logon0210_4367220121562.doc. If the user opened the malicious
document and enabled macros then, the document would drop the Hancitor DLL (SHA1:
17693bca881ec9bc9851fcb022a664704c048b9d).
As we can see, in this case the hackers used IDN domains again to spoof a real banking
website. Moreover, if we compare unique URLs generated while analyzing phishing pages
from both campaigns, it is clear that both phishing pages were created using the same kit,
with slight modifications.
Based on the information we collected, we can therefore conclude with a high degree of
reliability that both clusters of phishing pages are part of a long-running phishing campaign
conducted by one cybercriminal group.
