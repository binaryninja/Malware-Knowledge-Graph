Research of this malware family began when I found a malicious task starting powershell
code directly from a registry key within our user base. I wasn’t expecting the surprise I’d
arrived at when I began tracking its origins. Living in a smaller country, Czech Republic, it is
a rare sight to see someone exclusively targeting the local Czech/Slovak audience. The
threat actor seems to have been creating malware since 2015 and appears to be from
Slovakia. The bad actor’s repertoire contains a few RATs , some packers for
cryptominers and, almost obligatorily, ransomware , and I have named the malware
family Certishell . This person’s malware is spread with illegal copies of songs and
movies and with alleged cracks and keygens of games and common tools ( GTA SA ,
Mafia , Avast , Microsoft Office ) that were hosted on one of the most popular
Czech and Slovak file-sharing services uloz.to .

The Ceritshell family can be split into three different parts.
1. RAT with a C&C server sivpici.php5[.]sk (Czech/Slovak slang for “you are
fucked up”), which has AutoIT, C++ and Go versions.
2. Miner downloaded from hacked websites and started with the script que.vbs from
the task.
3. Miner or ransomware downloaded from hacked websites and launched from a
powershell command hidden in registry keys. The command from the registry key is
started with the task from the picture above.

The map above shows the risk ratio of users around who were at risk of encountering one
of the malware families

Sivpici.php5.sk (2015-2018)

The oldest part of the family is a simple RAT with sivpici.php5[.]sk as the C&C server.
It places all the needed files in the folder .win inside of the user folder.
The malware installer comes disguised as one of the following:
2/26

Cracked software, such as FixmyPC ,
Fraud apps, like SteamCDKeys that share Steam keys,
Music CD unpackers with names like Extractor.exe or Heslo.exe (Heslo means
password in Czech/Slovak) that come with a password protected archive with music
files.
The malicious executable downloads an executable named UnRAR.exe and a malicious
archive that contains a simple RAT written in C++, AutoIT or Go.

Installer
Every executable installing this malware family contains a script similar to the one in the
following picture optionally with curl.exe . This script usually shows the password to
archive or start another application. The malicious part downloads a legitimate RAR
extractor UnRAR.exe and a malicious archive that can be password protected and
unpacks it into the %UserProfile%\.win\ folder. In the end it registers one of the
unpacked files as a service, starts it and allows one of the binaries in the firewall.

I found six different methods used to pack the script into executable binary:

3/26

1. Bat2exe
2. Quick Batch File Compiler
3. Compiled AutoIT version

4. Compiled AutoIT version with obfuscated script

5. Compiled AutoIT version with obfuscated script and packed with PELock
6. Compiled AutoIT version with obfuscated script packed with VMProtect

RAT
There are three main variants of this RAT. All of them use the same C&C
sivpici.php5[.]sk and similar communication protocol. The most advanced is a
compiled AutoIT script. This script comes in 10 different main versions. The second one is
written in C++ and we found only one main version and the last one is written in Go also
with one main version.
The first time it is run, it generates a random alphanumeric string that works as an
identificator for the C&C. This identificator is saved into file gen.gen for next start. The
communication uses the HTTP protocol. Infected machines send the following back the
C&C:
= ComputerName,
os = content of SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows
NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductName ,
uniq = generated identifier, saved in \.win\gen.gen
pc

with the GET method to start.php .
After a random period of time, the malware starts asking for commands using the GET
method with the parameter uniq . The response is a number that has fixed meanings
throughout all the versions. Commands “1” – “7” are implemented as follows:
1. The RAT downloads a URL from /urlg.php using uniq , from this URL it
downloads a file, packed.rar , then the RAT starts run.bat from the installation
phase to UnRaR the package to the \.win\Lambda folder and restart the RAT. This
allows the RAT to update itself and also download any other file necessary.
2. Create a screenshot and send it with the POST method to the up.php .
3. Send all file names from all drives to up.php .
4. DDoS attack to a chosen IP through UDP / HTTP / PING .
5. Get a list of all installed apps from
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

saves it to /.win/installed.txt and send them to up.php .
6. Get a list of all running processes, save it to /.win/processes.txt and send them
to up.php .
7. Collect log from keylogger, save it to \.win\log.txt and send it to up.php .
The RAT in the form of compiled AutoIT script has the name Winhost.exe .

There is a comparison of different versions (versioning by the author of the RAT) in the
following table.

1–7

Keylogger is separate executable ( ~\.win\1.exe )

Comparission of different version of AutoIT RAT
The keylogger in versions eight and nine is copied from the official AutoIT documentation
(with a few small changes)
https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/libfunctions/_WinAPI_SetWindowsHookEx.htm

Version 9 adds coloring of keys, mouse movements and clipboard in the keylogger.
The C++ RAT is named dwms.exe . It uses LibCURL to communicate with the C&C. The
communication protocol is the same. The uniq identifier is saved in the fr.fr file
instead of gen.gen for the AutoIT version, it also starts communication by accessing
connect.php instead of start.php .
I’ve managed to find a debugging version that only has the first command implemented and
returns only “Command 2” and “Command 3” to the standard output for the second and
third command. After every command it answers the C&C by sending uniq and verzia
(“version” in English) with GET method to online.php .
The “production” version is labeled as version A. The code is divided into two functions:
LLLoad downloads the URL address of the C&C server from the pastebin and tests

it by downloading /exists.txt .

7/26

RRRun that contains the first two commands as described above. It also uses
/connect/ path for register.php ,

load.php , online.php and

verzia.php .

To download newer versions it uses curl called from the command line.

Another difference is that screenshots taken are sent via FTP to a different domain:
freetips.php5[.]sk/public_html/SHOT.bmp

with the username sivpici and password A1B2C3D4 .
The RAT written in Go only has the first command implemented, but it downloads
/cnct/ad.txt and it opens URLs contained on victims computer, thus we speculate it
could also work as adware.

IECache, bitly, pastebin (2016-2018)
The installation of this coinminer is similar to the RAT in the previous section. Installations
use the same folder and the scripts have the same name. It usually comes as an unpacker
of illegal copies of music and movies downloaded from uloz.to . It uses powershell to
download and execute scripts from a bit.ly shortened address. The final stage is coinminer
IECache.exe , which is usually XMRig.

Heslo.txt.exe, Crack.exe…

8/26

There is a huge variety of programs that download bit.ly-shortened Czech and Slovak sites
and execute them. These programs include: GTA SA crack, Mafia, Microsoft Office, Sims,
Lego Star Wars, and unpackers for music and movies. These programs usually print a
message to the victim and run a malicious script in a hidden window.
The unpackers use UnRAR to unpack the archive and show the victim the password of that
archive.

Unpacker of a music album written in Python and packed with Pyinstaller. It tries to use
UnRAR.exe to unpack the music, if unsuccessful, it shows password “1234”.
The cracks on the other hand just show an error message.

Result of Patcher for Counter-Strike Global Offensive. After downloading and installing the
malware from Sourceforge it shows an error from the picture above.
All the installation files execute the following command with some bitly shortened site:

There are VBA scripts calling it, basic programs possibly written in C, .Net, AutoIT scripts,
Golang programs, Rust programs, Redlang programs, different packers of python and
batches, some of them use UPX, MPRESS, VMprotect and PELock.

Downloaded script
There are at least two new scripts created by the script from the site hidden behind the
bit.ly shortened URL, que.vbs and run.bat .
The script also creates one of two services named Winmgr and Winservice that start
que.vbs . Que.vbs only starts run.bat which downloads whats.txt contains a script
downloading and starting coinminer IECache.exe .

que.vbs hash:

Content of run.bat
In this case the pastebin contains two lines (the second line is splitted for better readability)

content of pastebin

The miner
The miner is saved as IECache.exe or ctfmon.exe .
The first miner (from June, 2018) is just XMRig that includes all command line options
inside the binary.

12/26

Most of the miners of this type I found are packed with VMProtect or
Themida/Winlicense .
The more interesting one (from Jun-Jul 2018) is a compiled AutoIT script packed with
VMProtect . Here again, we see that author speaks Slovak:

13/26

This script contains the XMRig as (in some cases LZMA compressed) Base64 encoded
string inside a variable. The miner is decoded and started in memory.

ODBASUJ64A is “decode base64” and ODLZMUJA is “LZMA decompress”.

In some versions, the script checks user activity and it starts different miners with different
options to maximize profit with lower risk of being caught.

_PUSTITAM is executes an binary in memory
Newer samples (Since August, 2018) use sRDI or XOR encryption in memory and injection
to a suspended process to hide from antivirus software.

Interesting files
Sourceforge and Github
Some of the samples used Sourceforge and Github to download malicious content, instead
of small, possibly hacked websites.

It downloaded content from a repository WEB of user W33v3ly on Github and from user
Dieworld on Sourceforge. On Github, the attacker once made a mistake and pushed
Systemcall.exe and TestDLL.bin to the wrong repository.

15/26

Systemcall.exe hash:
e9d96c6de650ada54b3788187132f525094ff7266b87c98d3dd1398c2d5c41a

TestDLL.bin hash:
1d2eda5525725f919cb4ef4412272f059abf4b6f25de5dc3b0fca4ce6ef5dd8e

The Systemcall.exe is a PE file without “MZ” in the beginning and Test.dll contains
some random bytes before the PE file. The dll contains XMRig encrypted with TEA and the
Systemcall.exe uses sRDI to load and run the Test.dll.

16/26

Steam Giver
This small application written in .Net shows some hacked Steam accounts.

17/26

The malicious part downloads and installs the following scripts and downloads UnRAR and
begin.rar

18/26

Install.vbs creates a task named WinD2 that starts inv.vbs upon every PC startup.
Inv.vbs starts runner.bat , which starts %temp%/Microsoft/NisSrve.exe that is

unpacked from begin.rar with UnRAR.exe .
Free bet tips
Betters are also targeted. We found a malicious file with the following readme file:

19/26

The binary included only starts a cmd with the script as an argument.

All from registry keys since 2018
After 2018, I observed an updated version of the malware family. There is no need for any
script file if you can have a command as a scheduled task and save enough data into
registry keys.
The infection vector is the same as in the previous case. The victim downloads and runs an
executable that downloads a powershell script from a hacked website whose URL is
shortened with bit.ly. This time the script is different, it creates the following task:

This task reads the value of the registry key Shell placed in HKLM\Software\a and
executes its content. The script also creates the Registry key.
Let’s focus on the value of the registry key Shell . In the following picture you will find the
value I found on an infected machine.

20/26

After decoding and decompression we get an obfuscated script:

21/26

Under two layers of string formatting and replacing we get another compressed base64
encoded script:

22/26

Inside the base64 string is malicious code that tests the connection and executes code
directly from the internet.

23/26

In total, I found about 40 different values of the Shell key in the wild that contain similar
code with different URLs and they are obfuscated in the same way or less.

24/26

Some of the pastebins were alive. For example, one of them contains the following scripts
that sends information about graphic cards to the C&C server, which can decide what to
install on an infected computer. I have not found any C&C server alive.

Ransomware
Another final stage that runs from the registry keys is ransomware Athos.exe. At first it
checks some tactics from https://blog.sevagas.com/IMG/pdf/BypassAVDynamics.pdf to
check if it runs in the sandbox. On the sixth start it injects ransomware into another process
that gets the id and encryption key from the web page googleprovider[.]ru . Then it
encrypts all the files with AES-CFB and shows the following message saved on imgur
( https://i.imgur[.]com/cKkSBSI.jpg ).

Translation: Your files are encrypted. If you want them back, you need your ID that you can

25/26

find in Athos_ID.txt on the desktop. Keep your ID secure, if you lose it, your files can’t be
recovered!!! You can recover your files with the help of the website www.g…
We also found AutoIT ransomware King Ouroboros translated to Slovak. The malware was
edited to use Windows users’ GUID as encryption key and to download additional content
from a different server than the original King Ouroboros.

Conclusion
Most of the methods described in this article are not new, in some cases I was able to find
their source. The most interesting method is hiding the powershell script to the registry
keys.
As I found out, the author is a Slovak speaker, this corresponds with the fact that the
infected files were published only on Uloz.to, therefore the victims are only from the Czech
Republic and Slovakia.
The variation of the final payload is huge. I found three different RATs, a few different
packers of coinminers and ransomware that were created by the author and many more
that were “available” on the internet. The initial installer, which function was to call only one
command, was also created with a huge variety of tools, some of them quite obscure.
To protect against this type of threat, it is enough to download software only from
trustworthy sources and use security software, like Avast Antivirus, which will act as a
safety net in case you should come across a threat.
