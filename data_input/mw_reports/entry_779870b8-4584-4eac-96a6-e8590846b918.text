Cybercrime tactics and techniques: Attack on home base

Attack on
home base
The coronavirus pandemic has left the world looking very different at the end of
the quarter than it did at the beginning. For starters, millions of workers are out
of the office and working from their homes. This change in scenery, combined
with safe social distancing efforts that help prevent the spread of COVID-19, has
created a crisis for many, but an opportunity for some.
Employees are accessing company resources through VPNs, utilizing cloudbased services, and spending countless hours chatting on communication tools,
all while connecting through personal networks and machines. In response,
cybercriminals have been deploying campaigns to trick users into installing
malware that steals login information for these sites, as well as provide remote
control of the endpoint to the attacker.
This special, COVID-19 themed CTNT report for January 2020 to March 2020
looks at the most prominently spread malware families taking advantage of this
crisis, as well as other cybercriminal efforts we observed. We will give you a look
into what the campaigns that spread these threats look like and the capabilities
of the malware, along with information about card skimmers and APT attacks,
wrapping up with some tips on staying safe.

Distributed
malware
Threats like Emotet and Trickbot are still a
big concern for businesses all over the world,
however, the threats we are going to cover in
this section are specifically using COVID-19
themed campaigns to spread. In fact, many of
the families we have seen being installed by
these campaigns have had very little success
prior to the last few months. These changes
represent a shift by cybercriminals to focus on
a new target, your home base.

The threats we are going to cover in this
section are specifically using COVID-19
themed campaigns to spread.

Other
efforts
Phishing emails and scary maps are not the only criminal operation we have seen
taking advantage of the current state of the world. In fact, home shoppers are at a
greater risk than ever with an increase in credit card skimmers found on webstore
checkout pages. In addition, government sponsored actors are trying to blend
their attacks in with the flood of coronavirus themed scams.

Card skimmers:
Panic buying, hoarding, and a drastic change in how we purchase goods—from
in-store to delivery and pickup—has resulted in rushed deployments of online
order forms, price manipulation, counterfeit goods and, of course, online scams.
Cybercriminals focused on stealing financial data from users have increased the
compromise of online order forms and installation of card skimming code on
these web pages. We have seen a 26 percent increase in this kind of attack from
February to March 2020.

companies whose customers have become victims of this method of attack on the
Malwarebytes Labs blog: “Online credit card skimming increased by 26 percent
in March.”

State sponsored attacks:
Using COVID-19 as bait to trick users is not solely
a trick of the commercial cybercriminal; in fact,
numerous state-sponsored groups have used this
theme in phishing attacks against relevant targets.
From late January on, several cybercriminal and
state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT)
groups have been using coronavirus-based phishing
as their infection vector to gain a foothold on victim
machines and launch malware attacks. Just like the
spread of coronavirus itself, China was first hit by APT
groups and as the virus spread worldwide, so did the
attacks.
Their method of spreading threats with emails
varies depending on the group—some use template
injections, others use RTF exploits, and the majority
use malicious macro scripts, like the modus operandi
of non-state-funded attackers.
To read more about state-sponsored actors using
COVID-19 as bait, check out the Malwarebytes Labs
blog and a recent white paper we released: “APTs
and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats
use the coronavirus as a lure.”

Protecting
home base
The threat landscape of the last few months has been very different from the one
we saw at the end of 2019. Attacks in the COVID-19 era are focused on stealing
your information and using remote employees as doorways into more valuable
networks. This means that we need to make sure to spread valuable security
knowledge to protect people while they are working at home base.

Gain security through knowledge by:
1. Running security software on any system which is not only connected to your home network
but is also used regularly. With this current flood of attacks, the malware families being
deployed will change quickly to avoid detection and be difficult to defeat without updated
security tools that monitor system applications and behavior.
2. Using a virtual private network or VPN. This will not keep you protected from malware;
however, it will help to keep your online activities from your browser or connection revealing
personal information or tracing your behavior. This creates an additional measure of layered
protection when you shop online.
3. Using trusted sources for information, shopping, or applications. The spread of
misinformation allows many of the attacks mentioned in this report to flourish. So, relying on
certain trusted vendors, websites, and news sources is the best approach.
4. Avoiding repeated entries of credit card numbers into applications. Use something like
PayPal, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, or Google Pay, which can offer greater security of your
financial information and reduce the chance that your card information will be spread online.
5. Changing online service passwords on a separate, trusted computer, then thoroughly
cleaning the suspected system with an anti-malware application if there are identified active
infections or suspected system or data compromise.

Cybercrime tactics and techniques: Attack on home base

19

Conclusion
Themed phishing campaigns usually don’t last too long. In fact, once enough
information about their existence has been distributed, the attacks will become
less effective and we’ll see a return to regular attacks, like those pretending to be
from a bank or shipping company. What is likely going to last is the capability of
organizations to have their employees working remotely to cut down on overhead
or as an alternative to working in an office. This reality also means that attackers
who attempt to infiltrate organizations via their remote workers will continue to
develop their tactics and techniques long into the future.
