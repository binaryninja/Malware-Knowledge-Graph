Operation ShadowHammer is a new and highly targeted supply chain attack discovered by
Kaspersky Lab. The attack leveraged ASUS Live Update software to distribute malicious
code. Live Update is a utility which commonly comes pre-installed on most ASUS computers
and is used to update system drivers and BIOS/UEFI code.

As the details of this supply chain attack are still unfolding our ReversingLabs researchers
looked into what is currently publicly available. Using our Titanium Platform we’ve been able
to make a few connections which lead us to, what we believe is, the first iteration of this
malware code.
We started from the infected installation package that was published by Kaspersky Lab. Its
content is the main installation file called Setup.exe and two additional MSI installation
packages that contain all the software components that get installed on the system.

The main executable file, Setup.exe, carries the malicious payload. Because of this, we
decided to take a look at how we could pivot around Setup.exe and find additional samples

to analyze. Using our RHA1 functional similarity algorithm we’ve been able to do just that
and find 10 additional samples worth taking a closer look at.

From this point, the investigation is carried forward by TitaniumCore, our advanced file
decomposition engine. TitaniumCore has been able to extract embedded resources from all
of the RHA1 detected installation packages. The installation packages which have 58
extracted files are particularly interesting as they contain one variant of the ShadowHammer
attack.

This extracted executable is a Visual Studio C++ application that has been compiled with
debug symbol information enabled. These symbols unveil a bit more about the attacker and
the attack timeline.

PDB debugging information found within the extracted executable file

Based on the specifics of the file path, we were able to conclude that this is the original code
the adversaries developed specifically to carry out this attack. Since PDB paths are indexed
by our advanced search capabilities, finding all the other samples that share this path,
requires only a simple one keyword search.

Within this batch of samples, we looked at the oldest one, which has the following debugging
information.

The timestamp information within aligns perfectly with the attack timeline described by
Kaspersky Lab.
The details of the attack are still being investigated by our own team and the teams of
security researchers around the world. Our hope is that this short threat hunting blog will help
those looking for more details as they put the pieces of this puzzle back together.
