How to Respond to Emotet Infection (FAQ)
Emotet

Email
Since October 2019, there has been a growing number of Emotet infection cases in Japan.
JPCERT/CC issued a security alert as follows:
Alert Regarding Emotet Malware Infection
https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2019/at190044.html
The purpose of this entry is to provide instructions on how to check if you are infected with
Emotet and what you can do in case of infection (based on the information available as of
December 2019). If you are not familiar with the detailed investigation methods described
here, it is recommended that you consult with security vendors who can assist you.

We have been informed of emails impersonating someone. What can we do?
When suspicious email impersonating someone with an attachment is received, it is possible
that either of the following events has occurred:
A) The device that uses the sender’s account is infected with Emotet, and information about
emails and contact list have been stolen.
B) Partners and users (with whom you have exchanged emails) have been infected with
Emotet, and their contact list has been stolen. (The recipients of the malicious email have not
been infected with Emotet, but the email address has been added to the lists of recipients.)
If the email referring to an actual message body (Figure 1) is received, the device that uses
the sender’s email account is likely to be infected (case A).

In case of an email as in Figure 2, it is assumed that the email is auto-generated to disguise
itself as a reply to a thread. Both A) and B) can apply to this case, and it is unclear whether
the device that uses the email account is infected or not.

What can we do to check whether we are infected with Emotet or not?
(Updated on 6 February, 2020)

3/18

JPCERT/CC released a tool “EmoCheck” to check whether a device is infected with Emotet.
See below for instruction.
1. Check Emotet infection with EmoCheck
1-1.Download EmoCheck

Please download EmoCheck from the following website and copy it to the device that is
suspected of being infected. Please choose emocheck_x86.exe or emocheck_x64.exe
depending on the device. (If you are not sure which to use, choose emocheck_x86.exe.)
JPCERTCC/EmoCheck - GitHub
https://github.com/JPCERTCC/EmoCheck/releases
1-2.Execute EmoCheck

Execute the tool using the Command Prompt or PowerShell.
(Note: If you execute the program by double-clicking, it will be blocked by Windows Defender
Smart Screen as it does not have a Code Signing Certificate. We are now working to rectify
the issue in the next release.)
If you see the message “[!!] Detected” as follows, your device is infected with Emotet.

The result is also exported in .txt file in the folder where EmoCheck was executed.

If you see the message “No detection.”, your device is not infected with Emotet.

1-3. How to deal with the infection

If an infection has been found in your environment, you can deactivate the malware by either
of the following ways:
On Explorer, open the “image path” folder which is shown in the EmoCheck result and delete
the executable file in the folder.

6/18

Figure 8: Image path that stores Emotet (example)
Launch Task Manager, and in the “details” tab, choose the process ID which corresponds to
the process shown in the EmoCheck result. Click “End Process”.

If you are not able to confirm Emotet infection with EmoCheck, please follow the below
instruction to confirm.
1. Confirm with the impersonated person
7/18

Check whether the person opened the suspicious attachment and saw the messages in the
sample screenshots (See Reference “The screenshots of the attached Word file”). If they
have seen one of the messages, check whether the macro is enabled on their device. If the
macro is enabled, it is possible that the device is infected with malware.
2. Perform the scan with anti-virus software

Perform device scan with the latest anti-virus signatures.
*Emotet has many variants, and even the latest signatures may not be able to detect
infection for a few days. No detection does not necessarily mean no infection. It is
recommended to update the signatures and conduct the scan regularly.
3. Check auto-start settings

Emotet has several methods for maintaining persistence such as setting auto-start registry
keys, save the payload into Startup folder, etc.
Check the following settings and confirm that suspicious file or setting does not exist.
[Typical Windows OS auto-start settings]
Auto-start registry [*1]
Task Scheduler
Service
Startup folder
(*1)

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

[Folders that Emotet is likely to be located]
Folders under C:\Users(username)\AppData\Local\
C:\ProgramData\
C:\Windows\system32\
C:\
C:\Windows
C:\Windows\Syswow64
*If there is a suspicious executable file under C:\ProgramData\ that is registered in the Task
Scheduler, it is likely that the device is also infected with Trickbot.

4. Check email server log

Check the following points in your email server logs:
High volume of impersonating emails whose HeaderFrom and EnvelopFrom do not
match
Unusual increase in the volume of outbound emails
High volume of emails with a Word file attachment
5. Check network traffic log

If you record/monitor outbound communication, check proxy and firewall logs for any
suspicious access to multiple ports (C&C server) from a single device.
[Example of ports that Emotet uses]

9/18

20/TCP, 22/TCP, 80/TCP, 443/TCP, 446/TCP, 447/TCP, 449/TCP,465/TCP, 7080/TCP,
8080/TCP, 8090/TCP etc.

What can we do when we find Emotet infection?
1. Isolate the infected device, preserve evidence and investigate affected area

Preserve evidence of the infected device
Check the emails stored in the device and email addresses in the contact list (These
may have been leaked)
2. Change password of email accounts etc. used in the infected device

Email accounts used in Outlook and Thunderbird
Credentials stored in Web browsers
3. Investigate all devices in the network to which the infected device was connected

Check other devices in the network as the malware is capable of spreading infection by
lateral movement
The following TTPs have been confirmed for lateral movement:
Leverage SMB vulnerability (EternalBlue)
Log on to Windows network
Use Administrative share
Register services
4. Monitor network traffic log

10/18

Make sure that the infected device is isolated and check whether there is any other
infected device
5. Check other malware infection

Check whether the infected device is also infected with other types of malware as
Emotet is capable of infecting the device with other types of malware. If this happens,
further investigation and response is required.
Some victims in Japan have also been infected with banking trojans such as
Ursnif and Trickbot
Victims overseas were also found infected with targeted ransomware
6. Alert stakeholders who may also be affected (whose email addresses have been stolen by the attacker)

Emails and email addresses in the contact list in the case A
Issue a press release if a wide range of stakeholders may be affected.
7. Initialise the infected device

How can we stop emails being sent from stolen accounts?
If emails and email addresses are stolen as a result of Emotet infection, impersonating
emails with a malicious attachment will be sent continuously. Information of the stolen email
addresses (message body and contact lists) are collected in the attack infrastructure, and
this is used to distribute malware-attached emails. There is no way to stop emails from being
sent.
It is likely that the recipients will continue to receive malware-attached emails repeatedly or
impersonating emails will be sent to the stolen contacts. Please beware not to open
suspicious email attachments. It is also recommended to perform the scan with the latest
anti-virus signatures and make sure that your OS and software are running with the latest
security updates.

What impact is expected if a device is infected with Emotet?
Emotet infection leads to exfiltration of emails and email addresses. Credentials stored in
Web browsers can be harvested. It is also possible that the infection spreads to other
devices in the network and that devices are at the risk of being infected with other types of
malware such as banking trojans and ransomware.

What can we do to prevent Emotet infection?
Please refer to JPCERT/CC’s security alert for details.
