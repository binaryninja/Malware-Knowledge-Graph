Threat Thursday: NetWire RAT is Coming Down the Line

The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

NetWire is a publicly available, multi-platform Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that is designed
to target victims on Windows®, MacOS®, and Linux®. This threat has been distributed in
phishing campaigns via weaponized Microsoft® documents, PDFs containing download
links, and archive files containing payloads. It has also been seen for sale on the dark net,
typically ranging in price from $40 to $140 USD.
The goal of NetWire is to perform surveillance or take control of the infected system. Once
the RAT has compromised a machine, the attacker can execute a variety of remote actions
from its command and control (C2) server.
The malware’s surveillance abilities include logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and
stealing passwords, as well as accessing web cameras and microphones.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
NetWire was first discovered in the wild in 2012, and it has been used since then by
financially motivated cyber-criminals, as well as advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.
Typically, the infection vector used to distribute this malware is via phishing campaigns
where victims are lured into clicking on malicious Microsoft® Office files that contain
embedded macros, which then launch a payload. The malware has also been seen
spreading via malicious URLs in PDF files, as well as through malicious attachments in
emails.
The variant analyzed in this report was a binary created to target Windows machines. The
file would arrive as a Win32 executable that is UPX-packed to help impede analysis.
The malware also uses an anti-analysis technique to avoid execution in a sandbox. The
“GetCursorPos” function is called twice, as seen below, and the cursor positions are
compared. The malware will not run until there is a difference in the mouse cursor positions.

Figure 1: Anti-sandbox technique
These are not the only tricks NetWire uses to hide its activity. When executed, the malicious
binary creates a child process, and its code is then overwritten into this process. Because
this is where the malicious activity spawns from, this makes analysis more difficult.
The parent process drops the child process into the “User/AppData/Roaming/Install”
directory and exits itself. This is shown in the image below, with the filename “Host.exe.”

NetWire creates a registry key and adds it to the auto-run group to achieve persistence.
This will ensure that the malicious file will run automatically when the victim’s machine is
booted up.

By analyzing the strings in memory, we can see some of the functionality carried out by
NetWire, and the information that it is attempting to gather.
It tries to gather user login data from web browsers such as Google Chrome™ and Brave®
Browser.

The malware also scans the directories of Microsoft® Outlook® profiles on the victim’s
machine to gather credentials. It also collects and logs both keystrokes and mouse
movements.
The keystrokes are of particular interest to the attacker as a potential source of sensitive
information that can be used for malicious activity or financial gain. This could include data
such as login details for online banking sites, credit card information, corporate network

access credentials, or crypto wallets. This harvested information can often fetch a hefty
price on underground forums and the dark web.
NetWire creates a log file on the victim’s machine in the
“User/Analyst/AppData/Roaming/Logs” directory, where it stores all captured data. As
shown below, the log file is named using the format DAY-MONTH-YEAR, matching the date
the victim’s machine was infected.

The data contained within the log file is encrypted using an RC4 cryptographic algorithm,
the same algorithm the malware uses to encrypt strings and DLLs. NetWire also uses this
obfuscation technique to hide registry keys, APIs, DLL names, and other strings.
Figure 6 shows the contents of the encrypted log file. The file grows larger the longer the
malware remains on the machine, as it gathers more data.

The malware also creates a mutex called “OqvAvPni” on the target machine. This is used
by the malware author to avoid reinfection of the same host.

NetWire will attempt to create a TCP connection with a remote C2 server. In the sample
used in this analysis, there were continuous attempts to create a connection over port 3382
with the IP Address 192[.]169[.].69[.]25.
From the strings in memory, we can see the DNS of the C2 server that this variant is
attempting to reach is “love82[.]duckdns[.]org”.

If this connection is successful, the attacker can transfer captured data or perform further
malicious actions, such as downloading and executing additional malicious payloads.
In the instance shown below, the connection is unsuccessful as the RST flag is being
returned. A TCP segment is sent with a RST flag when a connection request is received on
the destination port, but no process is listening at that port. This likely means that the C2
server shown is no longer online and active.
