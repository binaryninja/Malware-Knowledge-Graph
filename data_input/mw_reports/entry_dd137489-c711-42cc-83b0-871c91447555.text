Swallowing the Snake's Tail:
Tracking Turla Infrastructure
By Insikt Group®

CTA-2020-0312

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Recorded Future’s Insikt Group® has developed new detection methods for Turla
malware and infrastructure as part of an in-depth investigation into recent Turla
activities. Data sources included the Recorded Future® Platform, ReversingLabs,
VirusTotal, Shodan, BinaryEdge, and various OSINT tools. The target audience for this
research includes security practitioners, network defenders, and threat intelligence
professionals who are interested in Russian nation-state computer network operations
activity.

Executive Summary
Turla, also known as Snake, Waterbug, and Venomous Bear, is a wellestablished, sophisticated, and strategically focused cyberespionage
group that has for over a decade been linked to operations against
research, diplomatic, and military organizations worldwide, with
an ongoing focus against entities within North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) nations in particular.
While many nation-state threat actor groups are becoming more
reliant on open source and commodity software for operations,
Turla continues to develop its own unique, advanced malware and
tools and adopts new methods of attack and obfuscation. It uses
these TTPs alongside older techniques and generic, open source
tools. For these reasons, Insikt Group assesses that Turla Group
will remain an active, advanced threat for years to come that will
continue to surprise with unique operational concepts.
However, the group’s consistent patterns and use of stable and
periodically updated versions of unique malware for lengthy
campaigns may allow defenders to proactively track and identify
Turla’s infrastructure and activities. This research examines the
history of Turla’s operations and provides our methodology for
identifying infrastructure currently being used by Turla, focusing
on several Turla-associated malware types. Details on two of them
— the composite Mosquito backdoor and the hijacked Iranian
TwoFace ASPX web shell — are provided in this report.
Recorded Future has provided a detailed report to our clients with
further research and detections for additional Turla-related malware
families, which is available in the Recorded Future platform.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Key Judgments
• Turla Group can be tracked based on unique features of their
malware and C2 communication. Additionally, Turla’s use of
open source tools when avoiding detection and confusing
attribution attempts also allows researchers to quickly analyze
and build detections, as the source code is readily available
for analysis and testing.
• In June 2019, Turla Group was found to have infiltrated the
computer network operations infrastructure of APT34, an
Iranian threat group. This amounted to the effective takeover
of the computer network operations of a nation-state group
by state actors from another country — an unprecedented
action. Insikt Group assesses that Turla Group’s use of APT34
infrastructure was primarily opportunistic in nature and was
not coordinated between Iranian and Russian organizations.
• Recorded Future assesses with high confidence that TwoFace
is the Iranian APT34 ASPX shell Turla was scanning for to pivot
to additional hosts, as documented in the NSA/NCSC report.
We assess that any live TwoFace shells as of late January 2020
could also be potential operational assets of the Turla Group.
• In 2019, Turla began relying heavily on PowerShell scripts for
malware installation. Previously, it had also heavily targeted
Microsoft vulnerabilities as well as email servers. Turla
also often uses compromised WordPress websites as the
foundation of its C2 infrastructure.
• Among the malware that we researched, Turla mainly uses
HTTP/S for their command and control (C2) communication.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Background
Turla has been attributed to operations targeting the Pentagon
as early as 2008 and has continued targeting NATO nations to the
present day. Primary targets of Turla include publishing and media
companies, universities/academia, and government organizations,
often specifically targeting scientific and energy research, remote
and local diplomatic affairs, and military data. Turla actively targets
European and CIS countries, historically focusing on ministries
of foreign affairs or defense, as well as similar government
organizations and affiliated research institutions.
Turla is known for its use of watering hole attacks (compromising
websites to target visitors) and spearphishing campaigns to precisely
attack specific entities of interest. Turla has also used inventive, outof-the box techniques, including using satellites to exfiltrate data
from remote areas in North Africa and the Middle East. The group
is known for the use of both unaltered and customized versions of
open source software such as Meterpreter and Mimikatz, as well as
bespoke malware such as Gazer, IcedCoffee, Carbon, and Mosquito.
Turla operators have also commandeered third-party infrastructure
or used false flags in order to further their purposes. In many cases,
this group has used compromised websites (typically WordPress
sites) as both an infection vector and as operational infrastructure
for C2 communications.
In June 2019, Turla was identified by researchers at Symantec as
having infiltrated the computer network operations infrastructure
of APT34, an Iranian threat group, collecting and exfiltrating Iranian
operational information, and simultaneously gaining access to
active victims of the Iranians.
Turla’s hijacking of Iranian APT34 operations in part consisted of
scanning for and discovering their web shells using existing APT34
victim networks to scan for a specific web shell on IP addresses
across at least 35 different countries. Once identified, Turla used
these shells to gain an initial foothold into victims of interest and
then deployed further tools.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

TwoFace, first observed in 2015, is the primary APT34 web shell, and
Recorded Future assesses with high confidence that TwoFace is the
shell Turla was scanning for to pivot to additional hosts. We assess
that any live TwoFace shells as of late January 2020 could also be
potential operational assets of the Turla Group.
Turla also directly accessed C2 panels of the APT34 Poison Frog tool
from their own infrastructure and used this access to task victims
with downloading Turla tools.

Threat Analysis
To date, Turla Group’s hijacking of Iranian computer network
operations resources has been unique among known threat actors;
this action amounted to the effective takeover of the computer
network operations of a nation-state group by state actors from
another country.
Although it is possible that the Iranian and Russian organizations
were cooperating in some manner, the evidence available to Insikt
Group does not support this theory. For example, while Turla had
significant insight into APT34 tools and operations, they were
required to scan for Iranian web shells in order to find where
these tools were deployed. We assess that Turla’s interposition into
Iranian operations was likely an uncoordinated, and thus hostile,
act.
While Insikt Group assesses that Turla Group’s use of APT34
infrastructure was primarily opportunistic in nature, an added
benefit for the operators was likely the deception of incident
responders who would potentially identify the tools as Iranian in
origin. Turla has reused malware from other threat actors prior to
their use of Iranian tools, including the use of Chinese-attributed
Quarian malware in 2012. In that instance, Kaspersky researchers
assessed that Turla actors downloaded, then uninstalled, the
Quarian malware in an attempt to divert and deceive incident
responders post-discovery.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Outside of their bold Iranian venture, Turla has concurrently
conducted other operational and development activities. In 2019,
Turla started heavily using PowerShell scripts, likely in an effort to
avoid discovery of malicious files on disk. Over the course of the
year, they have increased their use of PowerShell scripts, using
PowerSploit and PowerShell Empire, as well as developing their
own Powershell backdoor, PowerStallion.
While Turla most often targets Microsoft Windows operating systems,
they have also purposely exploited email servers. The LightNeuron
backdoor is specifically designed to function on Microsoft Exchange
mail servers, and the Outlook backdoor is designed to operate on
Exchange and The Bat! (popular in Eastern Europe) email servers.
Compromising mail servers provides Turla control of email traffic
on a target network, including the ability to not only monitor email,
but create, send, and even block email.
Turla relies on compromised WordPress sites as C2s. They also have
regularly used WordPress-focused URL names for payload delivery
since 2014 and possibly earlier. This tendency enables the profiling
of their C2s and payload URLs to discover new Turla infrastructure.
Turla operations have been associated with a variety of custom
malware. Insikt Group performed deeper analysis on several of
these malware types in an effort to create scanning rules to detect
live Turla-associated infrastructure active from December 2019 to
January 2020.

Turla Advanced Detection Analysis
The focus of our analysis was the development of identification
methods for Turla, focusing on several Turla-associated malware
types. Details of our analysis of both the composite Mosquito
backdoor and the hijacked Iranian TwoFace web shell are provided
in this report.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Mosquito Controller Detection
In January 2018, ESET reported on a newer backdoor named
Mosquito that they observed Turla using during intrusion analysis.
There were multiple components to the Mosquito delivery and
installation, such as:
• Use of a trojanized Adobe installer
• Use of Metasploit shellcode to download a legitimate copy of
the Adobe Flash installer and a copy of Meterpreter in order
to enable the download and installation of the
Mosquito installer
• Installer with encrypted payload
• Launcher which executes the primary backdoor, “Commander”
Mosquito is a Win32 remote access trojan (RAT). The malware
includes three primary components: an installer, launcher, and
the backdoor component sometimes called CommanderDLL.
The Mosquito malware has been dropped after the initial use of
Metasploit shellcode and installation of Meterpreter to gain control
of the victim. It has the following capabilities:
• Download file
• Create process
• Delete file
• Upload file
• Execute shell commands
• Execute PowerShell commands
• Add C2 server
• Delete C2 server
Commander is the main component of the Mosquito backdoor.
In this research, we focused our analysis primarily on the C2
communication of Commander. For details on the other aspects
of the Mosquito package, a thorough analysis was conducted by
researchers at ESET.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2020-0312 | 6

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

ESET’s analysis of the communication from Commander to its C2
shows that communication to and from the controller is sent via
HTTP or HTTPS. On the client side, data can be sent as a parameter
in the GET request, as a cookie, or as the parameter and payload
of a POST (as shown in the image below). On the controller side,
responses and commands are sent as an HTTP payload.

Beacon from the Mosquito "Commander" backdoor with encrypted data sent in the POST parameter and payload.

As shown above, the data sent to the controller is not in clear text. It
is first protected with an encryption routine that uses a Blum Blum
Shub pseudo-random number generator to create a stream of bytes
that are used to XOR encode the cleartext data. The resulting data
is then Base64 encoded.
To encrypt or decrypt, a key and modulus are required by the
encryption process. As ESET reported, and as Insikt Group observed
during its analysis, the modulus of "0x7DFDC101" is hardcoded.
The key is not hardcoded and is randomly generated at each
exchange between the client and controller so the key is different
for each transmission. This randomized key is sent as a part of
the C2 communication and can be easily extracted. Insikt Group
analysts have reversed this pseudo-random number generator
implementation and have created a decoder script in Python that
can be found in our GitHub repository.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Mirroring analysis from ESET, Insikt Group found there is header
information prepended to the data being sent. The header, when
decrypted, consists of the following fields:
Fields

Further analysis of the Commander backdoor shows that the
response expected from the controller is an HTTP/S packet in which
the payload is Base64 encoded and then encrypted in the same way
as the C2 beacon packet. If the response is successfully decoded,
the first byte is checked, and if it is equal to 28, then the remaining
bytes of data are parsed. If the first byte is equal to 0x27, then
nothing else is done with the C2 response.

Commander Passive Scans
Using open source tools like urlscan.io, as well as proprietary
scanning methodologies developed by Insikt Group, the passive
scans look for evidence of compromised hosts beaconing back to
the controller. The queries search for the static aspects of the GET or
POST resource string "/scripts/m/query.php?id=" as demonstrated
in the link below:
• https://urlscan.io/search/#%22%2Fscripts%2Fm%2Fquery.

Examples of recent results from this query with urlscan.io include:
• 204.193.62.62/scripts/m/query.

• 204.193.62.62/scripts/m/query.php?id=eQV0AKBGOorB/

• 77.232.99.77/scripts/m/query.
php?id=eQV0AKBGOorB%2FsB6ZkIU0e%2BKQ...
The URLs above match the typical Mosquito URL pattern
perfectly. Using our Python decoder script mentioned above,
we can attempt to decode the encrypted portion of the URL,
“eQV0AKBGOorB%2FsB6ZkIU0e%2BKQO…” The results of our script
are shown below.

Decrypted urlscan.io Commander URL string.

After running the decode script, we can determine that the beginning
of the header is decoded correctly since we are able to extract the
ID, string values, and MAC address of the compromised device. For
both IPs, the data section cannot be decoded, but this is expected,
considering that the ID is 0x87, which indicates that this was a HTTP
POST and the actual data we would want to decode is in the HTTP
payload and not in the parameter. Based on this analysis, we assess
with medium confidence that these IPs are Mosquito Controllers.
TwoFace Web Shell Detection
The TwoFace web shell was first discovered and analyzed by the
Palo Alto Unit42 research team and later attributed to the group
they associate as OilRig, which is commonly associated with APT34.
As stated earlier, Turla scanned for the presence of the TwoFace
ASPX web shells, and then attempted to access and download Snake
or other malware. We believe that many of these web shells may
now be operational assets of Turla and no longer in the control of
APT34.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2020-0312 | 10

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The TwoFace web shell is actually two shells: an initial loader shell,
and a second, fully functional web shell that gives the operator
much more control of the website. Both components were written
in C# and designed to function on web servers supporting ASP.NET,
using Active Server Page Extended (ASPX) files to operate. TwoFace
is a remote access trojan with the following capabilities:
• Execute program
• Execute shell command
• Upload file
• Modify file
• Delete file
• Download file
• Timestomping (modification of file timestamps)
Accessing the web shell is done through a control panel
similar to the image below. The threat actors would then have to
authenticate in order to perform additional actions. However, even
without authentication, the presence of this specific .aspx file is
determination enough of the presence of the TwoFace web shell.

Outlook
Turla Group is a sophisticated threat actor, and despite many
nation-state groups becoming more reliant on open source and
commodity software for operations, Turla has continued to develop
its own unique, advanced malware. The Reductor RAT, a new strain
of malware for Turla first observed in late 2019, is an example of
such an innovation. Insikt Group expects to see continued use of
Reductor RAT in 2020.
While still using effective older techniques like virtual file systems
with Gazer and the Outlook backdoor, Turla has consistently
adopted newer methods like Reductor’s alteration of browser
pseudo-number generation, and continually developed new tools,
such as their recent .NET and PowerShell backdoors.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2020-0312 | 13

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

As mentioned earlier, this does not mean Turla does not use any
generic tools; Turla has used open source tools regularly, including
Mimikatz and Metasploit as delivery mechanisms for the Mosquito
backdoor.
Turla Group is assessed by Insikt Group to be a well-funded,
advanced nation-state group that has been active and improving its
tools and practices for many years. Although we expect its targeting
and practices to shift over time, Insikt Group assesses that Turla
Group will remain an active, advanced threat for years to come that
will continue to surprise with unique operational concepts. However,
the group’s consistent patterns and use of stable and periodically
updated versions of unique malware for lengthy campaigns may
allow proactive tracking and identification of its infrastructure and
activities in the future.
