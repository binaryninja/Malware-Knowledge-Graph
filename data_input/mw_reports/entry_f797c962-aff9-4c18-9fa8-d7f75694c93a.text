Scattered Canary
The Evolution and Inner Workings of a West African
Cybercriminal Startup Turned BEC Enterprise

© 2019 Agari Data, Inc.

BEC has continued to grow, taking the number one spot for greatest financial losses from
Internet crime. In a recent report, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported
that more than 20,000 businesses lost nearly $1.3 billion to BEC attacks in 2018. Globally, BEC
attacks have cost more than $13 billion in losses over the past five years.
But with the West African gang we’ve named Scattered Canary, we have a deeper look at how
business email compromise is connected to the rest of the cybercrime. With over ten years of
visibility into Scattered Canary’s operations, we have deep insight into how the group grew
from a single cybercriminal working Craigslist scams into an entire organization that consists of
dozens of criminals, each with specific tasks.
When the first member of Scattered Canary, who, for the purposes of this report, we call
Alpha, began his operations, he was a lone wolf—working mostly Craigslist scams as he learned
the tricks of the trade from a mentor. However, within a few years, he had honed his craft
enough to expand into romance scams, where he met his first “employee,” Beta. Once they
had secured enough mules via their romance scams to launder their stolen money, they shifted
from targeting individuals to targeting enterprises, and the group’s BEC operation was born.
Since its inception, at least 35 different actors have joined Scattered Canary in its fraudulent
schemes. The group has turned to a scalable model through which they can run multiple types
of scams at the same time. And with multiple tools designed to help them expand their operations
and stay hidden from law enforcement, it is no wonder that they are seeing massive success.
While BEC remains a favorite due to its ease and success, a look into Scattered Canary’s
operations demonstrates that these groups are not one-trick ponies. At any given time,
Scattered Canary is involved in a number of different types of scams simultaneously—including
romance scams, tax fraud, social security fraud, employment scams, and more. And this is only
one organization, out of the hundreds currently residing in West Africa and around the world.
With this much involvement between members, and so much connection between crime type,
we must look at the bigger picture to truly understand the enormity of the cybercrime problem.
If Scattered Canary can be seen as a microcosm for the rapidly evolving organizations behind
today’s most pernicious email scams, this report demonstrates that a much more holistic
approach—one based on threat actor identity rather than type of fraudulent activity—is
required to detect email fraud and protect organizations.

Fraud as a Growth Industry
In today’s rapidly-evolving cybercrime economy, business email compromise (BEC) has
emerged as a growth industry all its own. According to the most recent Internet Crime Report
from the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), “revenues” for this advanced form of
email fraud nearly doubled in 2018—to $1.3 billion. In all, more than $13.5 billion has been lost to
BEC scams since 2013. But investigation into the criminals behind BEC shows that $13.5 billion
is likely just the tip of the iceberg. Since 2015, BEC complaints have doubled year after year
and currently account for 45% of all reported complaints to IC3.

Agility: Essential for Rapid Diversification
One common misconception is that crime rings operate within set verticals—that BEC groups
only run BEC scams, groups focused on romance scams only run romance scams, and so forth.
But like entrepreneurs in any industry, cybercriminal organizations work to achieve growth by
developing and validating scalable business models across a diversified set of revenue streams.
Throughout our research into Scattered Canary, we can see how the main threat actors
encountered periods where opportunities for diversification presented themselves, and they
boldly and rapidly pushed forward into new terrain.
Due to their agile working practices, they have been able to bring in extra skilled “staff” at a
moment’s notice, typically by flaunting their wealth to display the trappings of their success.
Trust encourages a nepotistic approach to candidate selection, and many relationships are
formed while still in the Nigerian education system where talent is easily spotted, and where
recruitment can flourish naturally.

This investigation by the Agari Cyber Intelligence Division (ACID)
into the cybercriminal group we’ve named Scattered Canary offers
unprecedented visibility into eleven years of fraud and criminal
activities, and the growth of a 419 startup into a fully operational
BEC business. From our research, we have discovered that BEC
actors are playing very active roles in many other forms of criminal
activities—a fact that showcases just how much of an impact these
groups can create.

Through extensive active defense engagements and research over the last six months, we
have been able to build a detailed picture of not just the tactics and techniques currently
used by Scattered Canary, but also historically how they have adopted these over a period of
many years. While this criminal organization’s activities now center around BEC, and extend
to romance scams, credit card fraud, check fraud, fake job listings, credential harvesting, tax
schemes, and more, these actors came from much humbler beginnings, starting with basic
Craigslist scams in 2008.
Given the wide range of its activities, the extended ecosystem of individual actors with which
it collaborates, and the persistent optimism present in its range of email addresses, we have
dubbed this organization “Scattered Canary.” Over the course of active engagement with
operatives of this group, an ever-growing global footprint has emerged, eclipsing that of even
London Blue—the UK-based threat group we uncovered in December 2018.
Scale aside, we are resolute in our conclusion that BEC can no longer be seen in isolation and
thus unrelated to other email deployed criminal enterprises. Instead, we must view it as part of
a larger ecosystem of cybercrime, with BEC as its current apex. Infrastructure, and actors, are
common across the entire cybercrime industry, and knowing this will help to generate further
discussion about ways to curtail and shut down these maturing operations.

Catching Sight of Scattered Canary

2019 INTEL

As we have discovered, the same groups that reap billions in BEC schemes each year are also
partly to blame for the $360 million lost to romance scams, the $1 billion hijacked in real estate
transactions, and millions more pilfered through W-2 scams, payroll diversions, and other
types of fraud. This suite of email-based attack vectors is operated concurrently by modernday cybergangs including Scattered Canary, and represent the apex of years of both massive
growth and massive success.

5

This isn’t the first time our CFO has been targeted by a nefarious executive impersonator. The
criminal gang London Blue appeared on our radar in exactly the same way. So why have two
unrelated cybergangs made what seems like a high-risk decision to attack a firm focused on
stopping advanced email threats?
The answer is multifaceted. In many cases, they have not deemed it necessary to their tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to be aware of the industries of their targets. In order to
carry out the high volume of attacks that these larger gangs perpetrate, they strip the process
back to its most basic components, as any smart business would. The “essentials” comprise of
the name and email address of a CFO (or comparable financial executive) and the name and
email address of the CEO for the same organization. Once they have secured this information,
their reconnaissance need not go any further, as these details are fed into their existing
infrastructure, and any replies will be subject to non-industry specific social engineering.
Another reason cybercriminals are lax about their targets is likely due to their geographic
location. Many feel that they have a home team advantage living in Nigeria, where they are
free to pay off law enforcement to look the other way. Despite the introduction of the Nigerian
Cybercrime Act 2015, which carries a fine of up to 10 million naira for unlawfully accessing
a computer system or perpetuating fraud by using electronic messages, cybercrime in the
country has continued to expand. Criminals can often secure millions in profit through BEC and
other tactics, and are both willing and able to give local law enforcement enough to keep them
quiet. By doing so, they ensure that their operations can continue while they are protected
from persecution.

An Attack on Agari
On November 29, 2018, Scattered Canary sent an attack email to Agari CFO Raymond
Lim, enquiring as to his availability to send out a domestic wire transfer. This display name
deception attempt was quarantined by Agari Advanced Threat Protection™, and we then
actively engaged with the attacker in an attempt to establish his true intentions. What followed
was a series of engagements that resulted in our team gaining deep insight into this group—
including its scattershot origins, how its actors fit together, and how it achieved its remarkable
growth trajectory.

the group impersonated a senior executive at Agari in an email

AGARI | SCATTERED CANARY: THE EVOLUTION OF A WEST AFRICAN CYBERCRIMINAL STARTUP

After this initial engagement, we continued interacting with Scattered Canary for nearly
two more months. Over the course of this engagement, we coerced the group to send us
eight different mule accounts used to receive illicit funds from BEC victims and passed
this information to law enforcement and financial partners. Using a combination of active
engagement and other tactics, we were able to gain significant insight into Scattered Canary’s
history, methods, and primary actors. What follows is an overview of what we discovered
during our investigation.

2019 INTEL

As is common with nearly all our active engagements that request a bank payment, the
request was caveated with a requirement for a confirmation receipt to be sent upon
completion. This document is an essential part of the operational paperwork, as it allows
individual actors to prove to the Scattered Canary executive team that a successful payment
has been obtained. It also allows them to counter any argument by the mule account gobetween—especially if they are a third-party mule account broker—that no payment has been
received, when in actual fact it has. Working as an opportunistic criminal, alongside other
opportunistic criminals, does not come without its challenges.

BEC mastermind. Craigslist scammer. The romance victim recruited as
a money mule. In our research into Scattered Canary’s growth and
evolution, we were able to map out dozens of relationships, an entire
infrastructure, thousands of email discussion threads, hundreds of
romance and fraud victims, dozens of scam kits, and other evidence
that helps connect the dots between a wide universe of threat
actors and actions associated with this West African fraud ring.
In this and groups like them, hierarchical structures center on a few senior members who direct
operations while outsourcing specific duties to an open web of freelance agents.
In distributed networks that in some ways resemble the recombinant structure of terrorist cells,
honor among these thieves runs deep. Symbiotic relationships are built, fostered, and rewarded.
News of betrayal and bad “business practices” travels fast and can have a detrimental effect on
an actor’s ability to work with other fraudsters, and ultimately continue their business.

2017–Present

In this report, we examine many of Scattered Canary’s activities, approaches, and connections,
which we believe encompass only a small subset of what may be a larger organization with a
more expansive circle of influence. Some of the overlapping connections to be discussed in this
report are depicted here.

Who Is Scattered Canary?
A Flock of Fraudsters Comes into Focus

10

Over the last eleven years, Scattered Canary’s central figure, “Alpha,” transitioned from
individual contributor running Craigslist scams and check fraud to CEO of an organization
focused on business email compromise. Today, he directs operations and leverages outside
expertise on an ad-hoc basis to test and refine new approaches to email fraud in pursuit of
evermore remunerative scams. Based on intelligence gathered from Scattered Canary, we have
been able to reconstruct the group’s transformation through the years—as well as dozens of
tactics used in its scams. This is the story of how a 419 start-up grew into a BEC powerhouse.

2008–2010: Starting Small
Based on historical research into Scattered Canary’s operations, the group started with a single
individual, who we call Alpha in this report. Alpha started out in the trenches of Craigslist
scams with his mentor, Omega, who would expose Alpha to things like check fraud and
romance scams. Alpha’s early role was fairly simple: engage with individuals, who he chose
based on the goods they were selling, and then provide personal shipping addresses back
to Omega. At the time, Craigslist was a training ground for West African scamming. New
players to the cybercrime scene could use the platform to hone their social engineering skills
before moving on to other types of fraud, such as romance scams. Two other groups we have
previously reported on—London Blue and Scarlet Widow—also cut their teeth on Craigslist
scams before evolving into other crimes.

Example Craigslist Scam Interaction

AGARI | SCATTERED CANARY: THE EVOLUTION OF A WEST AFRICAN CYBERCRIMINAL STARTUP

2019 INTEL

The basic premise of a Craigslist check fraud has become a criminal classic, and it starts
with the target listing a good or service on the platform. The scam starts when the scammer
reaches out to the potential victim, often asking for the face value of the product, then offering
more money in exchange for the victim sending a portion of that money to someone else. For
several years, this is where Alpha would hone his scamming tradecraft, setting the stage for his
BEC enterprise only seven years later.

13

In the early days, Alpha was completing most of the grunt work when it came to dealing with
people. In the fifteen month stint of Craigslist fraud, Alpha exchanged over 1,900 emails with
victims or scammers related to Craigslist and provided more than 100 addresses to Omega,
who was responsible for sending fake checks to victims. Alpha aimed high with each check—
typically between $2,000-$4,000.
How effective was this team? With Alpha averaging around eight victims per month in
Craigslist scams, the group made an average amount of $24,000 per month, which was split
amongst them. Omega and Alpha were obviously two willing participants in the fraud, but
there are some pieces of the puzzle that are missing. Who was receiving the packages of
money? Who picked up money face-to-face? Who was depositing the cash or sending it to
Nigeria? Based on our visibility, we believe that Omega handled most of these interactions.
Meanwhile, Alpha began to diversify his portfolio by dabbling into other types of crime. His first
move was into romance scams.

AGARI | SCATTERED CANARY: THE EVOLUTION OF A WEST AFRICAN CYBERCRIMINAL STARTUP

In the years of Craigslist scams, Alpha learned about targeting individuals and how these
419 scams worked. With Omega as a mentor, Alpha learned how to use different scripts and
formats to operate fraud at scale and how to convince victims to complete tasks on his behalf,
oftentimes coercing them into cashing checks.

2019 INTEL

Once the fraudster confirms the sale, they inform the seller that they wish to send a check
(which is counterfeit) and that the check will be made out for an amount greater than the
price of the item—with the stated request to have the seller forward the remaining balance
to another person. This person is commonly purported to be performing some function that
appears to be related to the purchase, oftentimes a shipping company that will pick up the
item on their behalf. The shipping company is, of course, fictitious, and the bank account
provided for forwarding or wiring is controlled by the fraudster. Quite often, the item in
question will just be left with the original owner once the criminal receives his money. But on
rare occasions, the third-party accomplice will actually pick up the item or items in-person,
while at the same time collecting the balance of the check in cash.

14

But why would someone invest the time and effort into pretending to be someone else just
to break their hearts? As with all scams, actors have one goal in mind: money. By pretending
to be a fake lover, romance scammers are able to fool victims into giving them access to their
bank accounts and retirement accounts or into purchasing prepaid debit cards to send to the
fraudsters. Once a romance victim has been milked out of all the money possible, they are
generally then converted into mules for when the scammer needs something physically moved
from one place to another, or when he needs fraudulent funds moved between accounts.
Romance scammers typically assign small tasks to their victims, such as opening a bank
account, wiring money from one account to another, or sending a few fake checks in the mail.
In order to maximize their investment, some scammers ask their victims to open new loan
accounts or credit lines for their “significant other,” only to get nothing back in return. In more
extreme cases of romance scams, victims have even been asked to bring suitcases of drugs
across country borders, thinking it was a chemical or solvent for their lover.
Alpha quickly learned the value of a romance mule. By using other people to do his dirty work,
he could engage with fewer clients and decrease his risk of being caught, all while seeing
increased profit margins. And as Scattered Canary grew over time, romance scam victims
would end up being a primary source for mule accounts.
The story of one Scattered Canary’s romance victim exemplifies the lengths to which these
groups use and reuse their victims until there is literally nothing left to exploit.
By March 2016, one of Scattered Canary’s members had built enough trust with a romance
victim—who we’ll call Jane—that she became a frequent source of new mule accounts for
the group. Since she had been converted to a mule at this point, it’s safe to assume that
Scattered Canary had already stolen as much money from her as they could. Over the next
eighteen months, Jane opened five mule accounts and bought twenty prepaid cards that were,
unbeknownst to her, used by the group to facilitate other scams.
After the new accounts were opened, Jane sent her fictitious online boyfriend the account
credentials, using passwords like weare4ever and 2hearts1love. Over time, these passwords
became things like 2muchmystery and iam2wornout as Jane grew tired of the mysterious
relationship with her online lover. Unfortunately and sadly, Jane passed away in September 2017.
Even after her death, though, Scattered Canary continued to victimize her. In October 2017, a
member of the group attempted to take out an auto loan using Jane’s personal information,
providing more evidence that these groups are only interested in one thing—money.

2019 INTEL

Using the social engineering knowledge he gained from working Craigslist scams, Alpha began
engaging in romance scams where he communicated with several victims through social
media, text messages, and Google Voice. Over this period, victims sent selfies, photos with
friends, love messages, and sweet nothings sharing that they’d been thinking about Alpha. In
order to maintain the fraudulent persona, Alpha even sent flowers to two victims—once in 2012
and again in 2014.

2010–2014: Branching Out

15

As Scattered Canary’s business expanded, mostly through romance scams, Alpha saw the
value of larger targets and met with the person who eventually became his co-conspirator
and who we refer to as Beta. Once these two men joined forces, they would pivot away from
targeting individuals to focus on enterprises. By all accounts, late 2015 was the beginning of
BEC for Scattered Canary.
In mid-2015, Scattered Canary started moving away from “long con” social engineering attacks
and toward more scalable—and ultimately more profitable—attack vectors. The first type of
attack they pivoted to was credential phishing. Between July 2015 and February 2016, Scattered
Canary’s primary focus seemed to be mass harvesting general credentials using a Google Docs
phishing page. In the first few months of their credential phishing ventures, Scattered Canary’s
sights were mostly set on Asian targets—Malaysia and Japan, in particular. In November 2015,
the group started to focus on North American users, mostly in the United States.
This activity ceased in February 2016, likely because the men who made up Scattered Canary
began to focus on honing their BEC skills. However, more than a year later in March 2017, they
returned to the credential phishing game. This time, though, the group’s focus had clearly
shifted away from individual users and toward corporate victims.
Instead of using fake Google Docs phishing pages to collect personal email login credentials,
Scattered Canary began using phishing pages of commonly used business applications to
compromise enterprise credentials. Key pages included ones that impersonated Adobe,
DocuSign, and OneDrive. For over eighteen months from March 2017 until November 2018,
Scattered Canary’s frequent enterprise-focused credential phishing campaigns almost exclusively
targeted businesses in the United States and Canada. In total, Scattered Canary received more
than 3,000 account credentials as a result of their phishing attacks.

2015–2017: Pivoting to Enterprises

2019 INTEL

While losses related to romance scams are typically tracked on their own, romance and BEC
scams are very close cousins when it comes to fraud. In almost every case investigated by our
team, when banking details of a phishing email included a person’s name, that person was an
unwitting participant of the BEC game. Over the years, we have had the honor of speaking
with several victims. In many cases, the victims simply believed that they were in a legitimate
online relationship and were unaware of the fraud they were committing. The devastating
piece is that many of these victims spent years entangled in the scheme—in one case over nine
years—before being notified by external parties or law enforcement.

First BEC Email Observed from Scattered Canary in November 2015

2019 INTEL

After a few months, the group settled on a tactic that they felt worked for them: directly
spoofing target company domains and requesting a payment via wire transfer to a supposed
vendor. Scattered Canary used this tactic of impersonating target domains until September
2016, when they switched to using obscure webmail accounts or email accounts linked to
domains registered by the group themselves.

AGARI | SCATTERED CANARY: THE EVOLUTION OF A WEST AFRICAN CYBERCRIMINAL STARTUP

Aside from credential phishing, Scattered Canary’s biggest evolution from individual targets
to corporate users came in November 2015, when the group, like so many other West African
cybercriminal groups, broke into the BEC space. In the early days of their BEC campaigns,
Scattered Canary tested multiple different methods of crafting deceptive emails, including
using different templates and impersonation tactics.

total, 19 individuals joined the group in different capacities during this three-year period. Most
of these new associates contributed to the group’s scams by providing a constantly fresh feed
of new mule accounts to Alpha. Others came onboard to help facilitate other types of scams
or build a more robust scamming infrastructure.

Beta’s primary role at the time, and what he continues
to focus on today, has been to act as the “mule
herder” for the group. In other words, Beta’s job is
to identify and recruit individuals who are then used
to receive the stolen proceeds of BEC attacks. Since
2015, Beta has relayed more than 150 mule accounts
to Alpha—more than any other Scattered Canary
group member by far. Over the years, Alpha has also
relied on Beta to assist in other types of scams, most
often handling the distribution of fake checks as part
of mystery shopper scams. By all accounts, this is
shockingly similar to how Omega used Alpha in the
first few years of Scattered Canary’s existence.

BETA

2019 INTEL

Until this point, Scattered Canary was made up of
only Alpha working as an individual contributor on
every scam, with a few tangential associates helping
out from time to time. However, as he became more
successful and transitioned into BEC, he looked to
expand his numbers and the first new “employee”
joined the group in October 2015—Beta.

19

Similar to how the group pivoted from individual victims to business targets during the
previous three-year period, Scattered Canary again set their sights on a new type of target
in 2017—government agencies. Using personal information obtained from various sources,
Scattered Canary started perpetrating fraud against US federal and state government
agencies. Notable targets include the ones listed here, among dozens of others.

2019 INTEL

By 2017, Scattered Canary had business-critical tools and tactics in place and started to define
functional roles across an ever-expanding array of revenue streams. Some group members
were responsible for managing BEC campaigns, some for forging checks and money orders,
and still others for harvesting stolen credit card numbers for use in various cons. Like any
rapidly-growing company, Scattered Canary took infrastructure into consideration and quickly
added Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers to help them scale and coordinate operations.
Meanwhile, the organization continued to market-test new approaches to defrauding a
growing universe of victims.

In addition to the scams above, Scattered Canary also used this technique to submit at least 48
credit card applications at four US-based financial institutions, resulting in the approval of at
least $65,000 in fraudulent credit.

Some cybercrime groups, including Scattered Canary, have exploited this feature by creating
numerous “dot variant” accounts on a single website that then directs communications for all
of those accounts to a single Gmail account. This allows scammers to scale their operations
more effectively by removing the need to create and monitor a different email account for
every account they create on a website.

AGARI | SCATTERED CANARY: THE EVOLUTION OF A WEST AFRICAN CYBERCRIMINAL STARTUP

Much of the fraudulent activity targeting government agencies has involved the use of a
technique that takes advantage of a “feature” within Gmail accounts. Unlike most online
services, Google does not recognize periods in email addresses. Instead, the email address
badscammer007@gmail.com and bad.scammer.007@gmail.com are both interpreted as the
same address and route email sent to each of those addresses to the same account.

Over the five-month span that Scattered Canary focused on collecting gift cards in their BEC
attacks, the group received at least 132 gift cards from victims, which netted them around
two bitcoin once they were traded on Paxful. Based on the price range of bitcoin during this
period, this translates to around $12,000 to $14,000 in profits. Interestingly, Scattered Canary
abandoned gift cards as a BEC cash out method in November 2018, at the same time the price
of bitcoin crashed.

Example of a Scattered Canary BEC Email Asking for Gift Cards

AGARI | SCATTERED CANARY: THE EVOLUTION OF A WEST AFRICAN CYBERCRIMINAL STARTUP

Like other scammers involved in gift card BEC scams, Scattered Canary laundered the gift
cards they received from victims through a peer-to-peer online cryptocurrency exchange
called Paxful. In our previous report on the Nigerian cybercriminal group Scarlet Widow, we
detailed the process by which stolen gift cards are converted into cash through a multi-step
laundering process using Paxful and other online cryptocurrency marketplaces.

2019 INTEL

While Scattered Canary’s targeting of government institutions demonstrates a notable
evolution in their attacks, the group’s primary focus over the past few years has been
continuing to improve their BEC phishing campaigns. In July 2018, following a trend we have
observed across the entire BEC threat landscape, Scattered Canary changed their preferred
cash out mechanism from wire transfers to gift cards. For five months, the group’s primary
focus was to persuade employees to purchase Apple iTunes and Amazon gift cards based on a
supposed request from their CEO.

Example of a Scattered Canary Payroll Diversion BEC Email

One of the reasons payroll diversion attacks have become a preferred BEC tactic for Scattered
Canary—as well as quickly emerging trend we’ve seen across the entire BEC threat landscape—
is because of the ability to use easily accessible prepaid debit cards to receive payroll direct
deposits. These prepaid debit cards come with a corresponding bank account, and they’re
much easier to set up. Rather than requiring a money mule to physically visit a bank branch to
open an account, the mule can simply register for a prepaid card online with a less stringent
application process and have a new card mailed directly to them. Combined with the fact
that most prepaid cards do not require credit checks, it is easy to see why this has become a
popular method for scammers.

After Scattered Canary moved on from gift card scams, they transitioned to another type of
BEC attack: payroll diversion scams. In these types of scams, rather than socially engineering
a finance employee to wire money to a “vendor” account, the scammer targets employees in
a company’s human resources department to persuade them to change the direct deposit
account associated with a high-level executive’s payroll information.

Overall, Scattered Canary’s membership has nearly
doubled over the past two years, adding another
15 actors to help scale the group’s operations.
While half of these new recruits came on board
to harvest new BEC mule accounts, the other half
were involved in other scams during this time, such
as mystery shopper scams and tax return fraud. In
total, 35 actors have been tied to Scattered Canary’s
operations since the group emerged in 2008.

ZETA

2019 INTEL

This tactic, along with the introduction of a fairly
new threat actor we’ve named Zeta, has allowed
Scattered Canary to scale their payroll diversion
schemes very quickly. Since late 2017, Zeta
contributed the most prepaid card accounts to
the group and has fed Alpha with more than 140
prepaid card numbers in the last eighteen months
alone. Because of Scattered Canary’s focus and
success on this type of BEC scam, Zeta has quickly
become one of the most impactful associates in
the group today.

Leads, Leads, Leads
In order to succeed in their BEC attacks, Scattered Canary first needed to find targets.
To do this, Scattered Canary, like other BEC criminal groups we’ve researched, uses online
commercial lead generation services—the same ones legitimate sales and marketing teams use
all over the world. Like any startup, though, Scattered Canary wanted to pinch pennies and
save money.
One of the ways they did this was to use the Gmail dot variant account technique discussed
earlier to sign up for a seven-day free trial period with a service like Lead411. The group would
then use the service to retrieve as many target leads as possible in the one-week timeframe.
Once the free trial ended, the group would let it lapse and then sign up for it again using
the same email address—but with periods in different places in the registered email address.
Scattered Canary did this a total of twenty times over a three-year period in order to maintain
access to this lead generation service without paying a monthly subscription.
Once the group had a list of leads, often for the Chief Financial Officer or other top executive,
and corresponding information for the CEO, they could then begin sending their malicious emails.

BEC “Formats”
When it comes to engaging targets, Scattered Canary frequently maximized efficiencies
through the use of scripts, or as some members of the group call them, “formats.” These
formats are templated text documents that can contain several layers of phishing messages
to send to potential victims. During our research into Scattered Canary, we identified a format
containing 26 different message templates that could be used to target organizations in a
variety of BEC scams, including direct deposit and W-2 fraud.

2019 INTEL

A core component of a business email compromise attack is
the email itself, which is the starting point for all successful BEC
scams. Just as with romance scams, actors make use of scripts
and templates they can copy-and-paste without having to create
something on their own. In the case of Scattered Canary, these
formats can be forwarded as a one-off task to group operatives to
send to targets, or they can be shared as a collection in phishing kits.
The components of a successful BEC attack include the following.

Scattered Canary CEO Format for Sending BEC Emails
26

By using social engineering, Alpha was able to convince organizations to send funds to
romance victims. Once victims received the money, romance mule handlers would instruct
them to wire the money elsewhere, eventually making its way back to the actors. If more
accounts were needed, the mule handler would simply ask the victims to open another
account for them, which is something Beta did with his victims.

VPNs for (Hidden) VIPs
While some actors do not hide the fact that they are operating from Nigeria, others have tried
to mask their true locations. Scattered Canary maintained subscriptions for several pieces
of software to communicate with potential BEC, check fraud, and romance scam victims
while remaining somewhat anonymous. To accomplish this, the group made use of VPN
infrastructure and applications in order to make their traffic appear more legitimate.

VOIP-Based Burner Phones
Over an eight year period, Scattered Canary leveraged several methods for texting back
and forth with victims. Three of the services the group used to engage with victims via SMS
were TextMe, Google Voice, and Hushed. While TextMe and Google Voice allow for unlimited
messaging, Hushed allows users to set up multiple phone numbers for voice and messaging
from the city or country of their choice—a useful tactic for engaging with romance scam victims
who believed that the person they were communicating with was located in a specific place.
Furthermore, the service allows users to switch to a new number whenever they wished. During
our analysis, we were able to identify ten Hushed phone numbers that Scattered Canary used to
engage with victims, as well as other threat actors and cybercrime groups. Of the ten Hushed
phone numbers we identified, four were based in the United Kingdom. The remaining six were
based in the United States, with two in Alabama, and one each in Hawaii, Illinois, Connecticut,
and Arkansas.
It is important to note that while Scattered Canary used Google Voice in romance scams
spanning four years, the same phone number was used in a host of other schemes as well.
Starting in late 2017, for instance, the actor listed it as a call-back number in fraudulent
applications for Hurricane Harvey disaster recovery assistance, home mortgage assistance,
online loan applications, staffing agency services, and more. The point remains—few scams
exist without a connection to one or more others run by the same criminal organization.

2019 INTEL

The next piece of the BEC puzzle Scattered Canary needed to solve was how to facilitate wire
transfers from victims without exposing the group’s own accounts. Beta specializes in romance
scams and was the first Scattered Canary member to start providing these bank account and
routing numbers to Alpha.

Bank Accounts to Transfer Funds

With BEC overlapping with dozens of other types of scams—ranging from credit card and check
fraud to romance scams to W-2 and payroll diversion schemes—approaching BEC as a singular
problem will not lead to success. Instead, it will only result in a frustrating game of digital
whack-a-mole, with no real success in finding and persecuting the actors responsible for it.
If Scattered Canary can be seen as a microcosm for the rapidly evolving organizations behind
today’s most pernicious email scams, this report demonstrates that a much more holistic
approach—one based on threat actor identity rather than type of fraudulent activity—is
required to detect email fraud and protect organizations.
This fight is not just about business email compromise. It is about all types of fraud, no matter
the form it takes today—or tomorrow.

2019 INTEL

When BEC first exploded in 2015, little was known about its origins or how it may relate to
other types of fraud. In order to effectively defeat BEC and the threat actors behind it, it is
critically important that we step back and look at the bigger picture—regardless of how big
that picture may be.
