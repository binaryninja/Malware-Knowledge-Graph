In a nutshell
Backdoor.OSX.Mokes.a is the most recently discovered OS X variant of a crossplatform backdoor which is able to operate on all major operating systems
(Windows,Linux,OS X). Please see also our analysis on the Windows and Linux
variants.
This malware family is able to steal various types of data from the victim’s machine
(Screenshots, Audio-/Video-Captures, Office-Documents, Keystrokes)
The backdoor is also able to execute arbitrary commands on the victim’s computer
To communicate it’s using strong AES-256-CBC encryption

Background
Back in January this year we found a new family of cross-platform backdoors for desktop
environments. After the discovery of the binaries for Linux and Windows systems, we have
now finally come across the OS X version of Mokes.A. It is written in C++ using Qt, a crossplatform application framework, and is statically linked to OpenSSL. This leads to a filesize of
approx. 14MB. Let’s have a look into this very fresh sample.

“Unpacked” Backdoor.OSX.Mokes.a
2/10

Its filename was “unpacked” when we got our hands on it, but we’re assuming that in-thewild it comes packed, just like its Linux variant.

Startup
When executed for the first time, the malware copies itself to the first available of the
following locations, in this order:
$HOME/Library/App Store/storeuserd
$HOME/Library/com.apple.spotlight/SpotlightHelper
$HOME/Library/Dock/com.apple.dock.cache
$HOME/Library/Skype/SkypeHelper
$HOME/Library/Dropbox/DropboxCache
$HOME/Library/Google/Chrome/nacld
$HOME/Library/Firefox/Profiles/profiled
Corresponding to that location, it creates a plist-file to achieve persistence on the system:

After that it’s time to establish a first connection with its C&C server using HTTP on TCP port
80:

3/10

The User-Agent string is hardcoded in the binary and the server replies to this “heartbeat”
request with “text/html” content of 208 bytes in length. Then the binary establishes an
encrypted connection on TCP port 443 using the AES-256-CBC algorithm.

Backdoor functionality
Its next task is to setup the backdoor features:

Capturing Audio

4/10

Monitoring Removable Storage

Capturing Screen (every 30 sec.)

Scanning the file system for Office documents (xls, xlsx, doc, docx)

The attacker controlling the C&C server is also able to define own file filters to enhance the
monitoring of the file system as well as executing arbitrary commands on the system.

5/10

Just like on other platforms, the malware creates several temporary files containing the
collected data if the C&C server is not available.
$TMPDIR/ss0-DDMMyy-HHmmss-nnn.sst (Screenshots)
$TMPDIR/aa0-DDMMyy-HHmmss-nnn.aat (Audiocaptures)
$TMPDIR/kk0-DDMMyy-HHmmss-nnn.kkt (Keylogs)
$TMPDIR/dd0-DDMMyy-HHmmss-nnn.ddt (Arbitrary Data)
DDMMyy = date: 070916 = 2016-09-07
HHmmss = time: 154411 = 15:44:11
nnn = milliseconds
If the environment variable $TMPDIR is not defined, “/tmp/” is used as the location
(http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qdir.html#tempPath).
