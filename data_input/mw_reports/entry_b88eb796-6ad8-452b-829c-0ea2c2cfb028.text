The notorious Raccoon Stealer, which was earlier distributed under the Malware-as-aService (MaaS) model, comes back to the cyber threat arena as a new version 2.0 enriched
with more advanced capabilities. Raccoon Stealer malware was previously reported to have
been replaced with Dridex Trojan by the RIG exploit kit as part of an ongoing campaign that
resulted in the temporary suspension of the malware operations in March 2022.
Cybersecurity researchers have recently unveiled a new malware family observed in the
wild, which shares similarities with Raccoon Stealer 2.0. The novel malware named
RecordBreaker is currently active in the information stealer market and hacker forums,
enabling threat actors to take advantage of upgraded password-stealing functionality and
enhanced malware capabilities.

Raccoon Stealer Malware Analysis
Starting from June 2022, the beta version of the Raccoon Stealer has been actively tested
within the hackers’ community, with Raccoon 2.0 already being offered for sale to a limited
number of threat actors at a price of $275 per month.
The latest Raccoon Stealer version, aka RecordBreaker, is coded from scratch leveraging
C/C++, with a brand-new back-end and capabilities to grab users’ credentials and sensitive
data.
According to the in-depth inquiry by Sekoia, Raccoon Stealer 2.0 is capable of stealing
system fingerprints, browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, web browser extensions,
individual files located on all disks, etc. Also, the new strain can take screenshots and grab
2/3

installed app lists. Although malware operators state that all the stolen details are encrypted,
Sekoia researchers haven’t observed this type of functionality.
Notably, the novel Raccoon version transfers data each time it collects a new piece of
information. Although it significantly increases the risk of detection, such behavior ensures
maximum effectiveness while flying under the radar.
