FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. Microsoft's Services And Reputation

16.

Microsoft® is a provider of the Windows® operating system and the Internet Explorer®

web browser, and a variety of other softAvare and services, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft
PowerPoint, and cloud-based services offered in connection therewith. Microsoft has invested

substantial resources in developing high-quality products and services. Due to the high quality

and effectiveness of Microsoft's products and services and the expenditure of significant resources
by Microsoft to market those products and services, Microsoft has generated substantial goodwill

with its customers, establishing a strong brand and developing the Microsoft name and the names
of its products and services into strong and famous world-wide symbols that are well-recognized

within its channels of trade. Microsoft has registered trademarks representing the quality of its
products and services and its brand, including Microsoft, Windows, and Internet Explorer. Copies
of the trademark registrations for the Microsoft, Windows, and Internet Explorer trademarks are
attached as Appendix C to this Complaint.
B. Barium

17.

Barium is highly sophisticated, well-resourced, organized, and patient. Barium specializes

in targeting high value organizations holding sensitive data, by gathering extensive information
about their employees through publicly available information and social media, using that

information to fashion phishing attacks intended to trick those employees into compromising their
computers and networks, compromising legitimate enterprise software provider's products not
protectedby antivirussoftware, and disguising its activitiesusingthe namesofMicrosoftand other
legitimate companies.

C. Barium's Tools

18.

Althoughthe Barium Defendants have relied on differentand distinct infrastructures in an

effort to evade detection, Bariumused the same e-mail address (hostay88@gmail.com) to register
malicious domains used in connection with at least two toolsets that Barium has employed to

compromise victim computers. As shown in Figure 1, below, Barium registered the domains
nott3ed.com and operatingbox.com using this e-mail address, and Barium also linked the same

e-mail address to a Microsoft account (johnxl9@hotmail.com) that was used to create malicious
profiles on the Microsoft Forums website TechNet to configure the "Barlaiy" malware on victim
computers (the Barlaiy malware is described in Part D.l, below).

D. Barium's Method Of Compromising And Stealing Information From Victims

19.

The Barium Defendants have employed at least two methods of compromising victim

computers. The first method, described in Part D.l, below, involves the "Barlaiy" and "PlugXL"

malware, which the Barium Defendants propagate using phishing techniques. The second method,
described in Part D.2, below, involves the "ShadowPad" malware, which the Barium Defendants

have distributed via a third-party software provider's compromised update.
1. Barium Method 1; "Barlaiv** And "PlugXL" Malware

a.

20.

Barium Defendants Deliver ^^Barlaiy" And 'TlugXL" Malware
Using Phishing Attacks

After selecting a victim organization. Barium will identify individuals employed by that

organization and attempt to ascertain their personal or work e-mail addresses. To enhance the
effectiveness of phishing attacks into the organization, Barium will collect additional background

informationfrom social media sites. Employing a technique known as "spear phishing," Barium
has heavily targeted individuals within Human Resources or Business Developmentdepartments
of the targeted organizations in order to compromise the computers of such individuals.
21.

In a typical spear phishing attack. Barium sends the targeted individual an e-mail

specifically crafted to induce that individual to take some action that will lead to the compromise
of their computer. Using the information gathered from its reconnaissance on social media sites,

Barium packages the phishing e-mail in a way that gives the e-mail credibility to the target user,
often by making the e-mail appear as if it were sent from an organization known to and trusted by
the victim or concerning a topic of interest to the victim. Barium uses the lure of a resume or

documents relatedto a currentknownprojectthat the target may be developing.
22.

Figure 2 depicts an example of such a spear phishing e-mail directed to a potential victim

who is a customer and user of Microsoft's Hotmail e-mail service:

23.

In the phishing e-mails sent to victims by the Barium Defendants (often specifically

tailored to the victim), there are file attachments or links that lead to malicious executable code.
Compressed file archives such as "7z," "ACE" and "RAR" file attachments are used to hide the
malicious code, which fhistrate automated e-mail malware detection. For instance, in the above

example phishing e-mail, a malicious archive entitled "project documents.7z" can be seen.
Because compressed file archives are not inherently malicious, these specific archives are able to
avoid network detection and deliver further malicious files, which are then used to deliver

malware. For example, Barium's archives may include one or more of the following:

24.

•

Windows Shortcut (.Ink) file with hidden payloads;

•

Windows Compiled HTML Help files (.chm);

•

Microsoft PowerPoint document with executable macro code;

•

Microsoft Word document with executable macro code; and/or

•

Microsoft Word document containing exploit code.

When the victim clicks on one of these links or opens the files, it causes the malware to be

installed on the victim's Windows-based computer.

25.

Operation Of "Barlaiy" and "PlugXL" Malware

Barium Defendants install the malicious "Win32/Barlaiy" malware and the malicious

"Win32/PlugX.L" malware on victim computers using the means described above.

Both

Win32/Barlaiy & Win32/PlugX.L are remote access "trojans," which allow Barium to gather a
victim's information, control a victim's device, install additional malware, and exfiltrate
information fi-om a victim's device.

26.

Barium Defendants install the malicious credential stealing and injection tool known as

"Win32/RibDoor.A!dha." This form of malicious executable software may be wrapped within a

custom dropper software known as "RbDoor," which requires a command-line password to
execute the included malware, allowing the Barium Defendants to evade antivirus software and
other threat-prevention tools utilized by Microsoft and its customers.
27.

In order to transmit stolen information to Barium and execute additional instructions, each

ofthese forms of malware needs to identify and communicate with external servers on the Internet

from which the malware receives instructions and configuration files. These external servers with
which the malware communicates are called Command and Control ("C&C") servers.
28.

Barium Defendants go to great lengths to conceal the identity and location of their C&C

servers through the following means.

The Barium Defendants configure their malware to

communicate with fake website "profile" pages that the Defendants have already set up on social
media websites, blog websites and forums, and publicly posted documents on other legitimate
websites (although the specific profiles, posts, and documents published by Defendants are fake
and malicious).

29.

Once installed on victims' computers, the malware is designed to reach out to these fake

website profiles and documents and search for particular text strings (pre-defined textual
"anchors"), such as comments or random alphanumeric text, that can be decoded and read by the

malware to obtain configuration files and the IP addresses and ports of other C&C servers. Once
the malware decodes the text strings, it is able to connect to C&C servers from which it obtains
additional instructions and to which it sends stolen information.

- 11 -

COMPLAINT

Case 1:17-cv-01224-TSE-MSN Document 1 Filed 10/26/17 Page 12 of 33 PageID# 12

30.

Barium uses this mechanism to conceal the IP addresses of C&C servers and evade

detection, as the general websites that are being reached out to are legitimate blog sites and social
media sites which many users use for business or other legitimate purposes (although Defendants'
specific accounts and profiles on those websites are fake and malicious). This technique also
enables the Barium Defendants to quickly and easily change the C&C servers, in an attempt to

evade efforts by antivirus vendors and the cybersecurity community, as the malware is not limited
to a particular set of C&C domains that are "hard coded" into the malware. In particular, the

Barium Defendants create fake profiles and postings for this purpose on both Microsoft-branded

websites as well as those of other well-known technology companies. The specific file paths of
these fake and malicious profiles include the URLs set forth on Appendix A of the Complaint.
31.

The table in Figure 3, below, is a sample list of such websites showing examples of the

format of the encoded malware configuration files:'

When the malware locates that text, it knows to read and decode the text between the braces in

order to generate the IP address and port name of the C&C server that the malware ultimately

Barium Method 2: ''ShadowPad" Malware

a.

Barium Defendants Use Third-Party Software Updates To
Deliver "ShadowPad" Malware To Windows Users And

Compromise Victim Computers

35.

In addition to using phishing tactics, Barium has also devised the following sophisticated

scheme to target Microsoft customers. Barium compromised a legitimate company, NetSarang
Inc. ("NetSarang"), headquartered in South Korea with a United States subsidiary. NetSarang

provides enterprise level products that streamline data transfer over complex networks, including
products designed to operate on the Microsoft Windows platform.
36.

The NetSarang products for Windows contain a type of file called a Dynamic Link Library

(DLL) file, named "nssock2.dll." Barium was able to compromise NetSarang's products by
modifying this legitimate DLL file and injecting two different bodies of malicious code into the

file, each heavily encrypted with advanced algorithms in order to conceal their purpose. The
addition of malicious code causes a change to the file size—the original file size of the legitimate
DLL file was 114896 bytes, but the modified, malicious DLL file, including extra malicious code,
is 180432 bytes. Figure 5 depicts these file changes made by Barium:

37.

The Barium Defendants inserted the modified, malicious file into the NetSarang build

environment, where NetSarang creates the final versions of the software that are ultimately
delivered by NetSarang to Microsoft's customers. By signing the malicious DLL files with
NetSarang's private certificate. Barium included the modified, malicious DLL file in routine

software updates for NetSarang products distributed to Windows users that would appear to be a
legitimate file from NetSarang.
38.

Once the DLL file was included in the build, any enterprise using the affected NetSarang

products and receiving updates would receive the Barium malicious file through the software
update process. Barium injected the malicious file in five NetSarang products. Typically, a build
environment is in a highly secured, controlled area with limited access.

39.

The Barium Defendants' ability to accomplish this demonstrates their technical and

operational sophistication. While not detected at the time, Microsoft's antivirus and security
products now detect this Barium malicious file and flag the file as "Win32/ShadowPad.A". This
particular Barium-modified malicious file is referred to as "ShadowPad" malware throughout.
b.

40.

Operation of "ShadowPad" Malware

This ShadowPad malware utilizes a two-stage method to do harm. ShadowPad Stage 1

malware utilizes the capability of the Microsoft programing language C-H- runtime to invoke
automatically, meaning the malware will initialize without requiring any action by the victim. This
method makes the ShadowPad Stage 1 malware less noticeable and difficult for any antivirus
software to detect. ShadowPad Stage 1 malware runs continuously after its initial execution and

attempts to access a Windows registry path that is unique to each victim in order to give the
infected device a persistent identifier.

41.

ShadowPad Stage 1 malware identifies and communicates with C&C servers utilizing a

complex custom algorithm. The malware leverages a Domain Generation Algorithm ("DGA") to
generate a unique Internet domain, based on month and year of the date set on the victim machine.

The infected computer reaches out for instructions to theseC&C domains. Thiscapability enables
ShadowPad Stage 1 malwareto generate a new C&C domain every month. Microsofthas reverse
- 16 -

COMPLAINT

Case 1:17-cv-01224-TSE-MSN Document 1 Filed 10/26/17 Page 17 of 33 PageID# 17

engineered the DGA and generated the C&C domains leveraged by ShadowPad Stage 1 malware.
These C&C domains include those listed in Appendix B of the Complaint.

42.

ShadowPad leverages domain registrar QHoster to register these Stage 1 C&C domains.

Typically, in order to register a domain name, the registrant must provide identifying and contact
information, including the registrant's full name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number,
administrative contact details, and technical contact details. This information is often referred to
as "WHOIS" data.

43.

WHOIS data is managed by the registrar with which a domain is registered and, by default,

is publicly available in order to enable the identification and to provide contact information for the
domain owner. However, registrars may also offer a service called "Privacy Protection." This
service enables a registrant to remove from public view the WHOIS data used to register the

domain and replaces it with generic information, typically for a proxy entity. All ofthe ShadowPad

Stage 1 malware domains are registered using the Privacy Protection service that is provided by
QHoster. Figure 6 shows the difference between the normal WHOIS data for a domain and the

Privacy Protection WHOIS data for a domain, as marketed by QHoster.^ In the normal WHOIS
data, the real address and e-mail address for the owner of the domain "jsmithprod.com" can be

seen. However, in the privacy protected WHOIS information, only generic information is listed
for that domain, including a general mailing address and random e-mail address. The Privacy
Protection service is not inherently malicious in nature, but the pattern of utilizing the service is
consistent with C&C domains leveraged by the ShadowPad malware.

44.

ShadowPad Stage 1 malware does not communicate to the C&C server directly. Instead,

ShadowPad Stage 1 malware sends information and receives C&C instructions via the Domain

Name System ("DNS") protocol. The DNS protocol is a set of processes and servers that tell a
computer attempting to visit a particular Internet domain how to resolve a request for that particular
domain and where to find the servers on the Internet for content associated with that domain.

45.

ShadowPad Stage 1 malware first attempts to perform a customized domain lookup for a

given C&C domain. It does so by doing a "lookup" ofthe C&C domain using public DNS servers
with the following IP addresses: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4,4.2.2.1, and 4.2.2.2. Ifthe Domain Name lookup

for the C&C domain fails, then the ShadowPadStage 1 malware performs a Domain Name lookup
using the DNS lookup facilities that are present locally on the victim device. Barium may be using

the public DNS servers for the first lookup attempt in an effort to avoid either local logging or
whitelisting, but if the public DNS servers are not available. Barium's malware will default back
to the local DNS servers in order to communicate with the C&C domain.

46.

ShadowPad Stage 1 malware collects the User Name, Machine Name (or "Hostname"),

and Domain Name of the victim device, and this information is first encrypted using a custom

-18-

COMPLAINT

Case 1:17-cv-01224-TSE-MSN Document 1 Filed 10/26/17 Page 19 of 33 PageID# 19

algorithm and then communicated to the C&C infrastructure viathe DNS TXT record.^
47.

ShadowPad Stage 1 malware explicitly uses DNS TXT records to communicate

information from the victim's computer to Barium and to deliver instructions to the victim's
computer. The initial information transmitted over this DNS protocol channel contains key

properties of the victim's computer, allowing the Barium Defendants to understand the victim's
system and the domain that the victim has joined. This domain information, for example, reflects
which companies' computers are infected and are now Barium victims.

48.

Below, at Figure 7, is an example of the encrypted information sent in the DNS TXT

record. In particular, a portion of an Internet domain called a "sub-domain" is stored in the DNS

TXT record, and that sub-domain is encoded with the encrypted User Name, Machine Name (or
"Hostname"), and Domain Name of the victim device. The C&C domain is the last portion of the
website address at the end of the domain path ("foryzedensrcd.com" indicated in black text in

Figure 7, below). The sub-domain, in which data is encrypted and stored in a DNS TXT record,

is the portion of the domain at the beginning of the domain path (the text highlighted in blue in
Figure 7, below).

^A "DNSTXT" record works as follows. Typically, the DNS protocol contains information in various forms of
records associated with a given Internet domain. For example, a DNS "A" record lists the IP address of the server
containing the content associated with the domain, and an "MX" record reflects information about an e-mail server
on the domain. A "DNS TXT" record is a type of record associated with a domain in which free-form, human
readable text informationmay be stored describingsome attribute of the domain. DNS TXT records can be used to
record and deliver information about a domain.

particular, in this example, custom data unique to the malware is captured followed by the name
of the machine ("ANDREA_XX"), the victim's usemame ("Administrator"), and the company's

domain ("ROOD").

This information is collected to identify which companies have been

infiltrated by Barium and further analyzed in order for the Defendants to prioritize their Stage 2
malware attacks.

ShadowPad Stage 1 malware awaits for a correct DNS response: a custom encrypted

response in a TXT record. A correct DNS response contains a decryptionkey for the ShadowPad

Stage 2 malware and modules associated with the ShadowPad Stage 2 malware. The decryption

-20-

COMPLAINT

Case 1:17-cv-01224-TSE-MSN Document 1 Filed 10/26/17 Page 21 of 33 PageID# 21

key in the DNS response would be utilized to activate ShadowPad Stage 2 malware. If the DNS

response is incorrect, then the ShadowPad Stage 1 attempts to reconnect after 8 hours.
51.

ShadowPad Stage 2 is modular, allowing Barium to customize the functionality of the

malware. These modules are encrypted and stored in the Windows registry. Configuration
modules (Config modules) contain backup C&C domains used to communicate with the Barium
Defendants (for example, notped.com. described in Part D.2, above), and these backup C&C
domains can be changed as needed. Config modules enable Barium to be more agile in changing
their infrastructure, as has been observed in previous Barium incidents. Thus far, the ShadowPad
Stage 2 modules identified are "DNS," "Install," "Online," and "Plugins" modules, and analysis
of these modules has identified the functionalities associated with them. ShadowPad Stage 2

modules can only be installed on the victim's computer if the ShadowPad Stage 1 malware is

successfully installed. Consequently, disrupting the Stage 1 infirastructure would halt further
infection of additional victims.

E. Barium Defendants Steal Intellectual Property And Personal Information From
Compromised Victim Computers

52.

Once the Barium Defendants have access to a victim computer through the malware

described above, they monitor the victim's activity and ultimately search for and steal sensitive
documents (for example, exfiltration of intellectual property regarding technology has been seen),
and personal information fi"om the victim's network.
53.

In the process ofinfecting and taking over control of its victim's computers. Barium causes

damage to those computers and the Microsoft Windows operating system licensed by Microsoft
to those computing device users. Barlaiy and ShadowPad are unique to the Barium Defendants.

54.

Barium uses a dropper to deploy ShadowPad malware, which eventually downloads other

modules. The following system registry hives are used by the ShadowPad malware:

55.

•

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\90368428\Data

•

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\90368428\Data

Additionally, Barlaiy malware makes changes to the system registry, also setting up and

- 21 -

COMPLAINT

Case 1:17-cv-01224-TSE-MSN Document 1 Filed 10/26/17 Page 22 of 33 PageID# 22

using registry paths that use Microsoft trademarked names, including the following:

56.

•

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

•

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Soflware\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

The installation of the Barium malware on a computing device essentially converts that

computing device into a tool that Barium then uses to attack the computing device's owner and

the network to which the computing device is connected. The Barium backdoors are composed of
several pieces with different functions, and the attacker can deploy a large set of tools to perform
tasks including key logging, e-mail address and file harvesting, information gathering about the
local computing devices, and remote communication with C&C servers.
F. Barium Has Attacked Many Microsoft Customers In Virginia, The United
States, And Around The World

57.

Barium has targeted Microsoft customers both in Virginia, the United States, and around

the world. Figure 9a, below, shows detections of encounters with the Barium actors and their

infrastructure, including infected computers located in Virginia, and Figure 9b, below, shows
detections of encounters throughout the United States. Each detection indicates an instance at
which one of Microsoft's Barium-specific signatures has been triggered. VeriSign, Inc., with

headquarters in Reston, Virginia, maintains the registry for domains used by Barium in connection
with their malware infrastructure.

Figure 10, below, shows the location of our detections of Barium encounters worldwide.

Barium frequently targets global and regional gaming industries. The NetSarang tools that Barium
modified with malicious code are very popular among gamers in Southeast Asia. As a result, many
gaming computers in Southeast Asia were exposed to infection.

G. Harm To Microsoft And Microsoft Customers

59.

Microsoft supports customers who have been victims of Barium. Mitigating Barium

intrusions on customer networks is often extremely expensive. In typical cases where Microsoft's

Global Incident Response and Recovery team supports an intrusion response related to Barium,
average costs can range from 250,000 to approximately 1.3 million dollars per incident, or more.

This does not include the cost of new architecture, intrusion prevention devices, network security
changesto prevent future intrusions, or the damage caused by having sensitive informationstolen.
-24-

COMPLAINT

Case 1:17-cv-01224-TSE-MSN Document 1 Filed 10/26/17 Page 25 of 33 PageID# 25

60.

Barium irreparably harms Microsoft by damaging its reputation, brands, and customer

goodwill. Microsoft is the providerof the Windows operating systemand the TechNet service, as
well as a variety of other software and services. Microsoft is the owner of the "Microsoft,"

"Windows," and "Internet Explorer" trademarks at Appendix C to the Complaint. Microsofthas
invested substantial resources in developing high-quality products and services. Due to the high
quality and effectiveness of Microsoft's products and services and the expenditure of significant
resources by Microsoft to market those products and services, Microsoft has generated substantial
goodwill with its customers, has established a strong brand, and has developed the Microsoft name

and the names of its products and services into strong and famous world-wide symbols that are
well-recognized within its channels oftrade. Microsoft has registered trademarks representing the

quality of its products and services and its brand, including the trademarks listed above.
61.

The activities of the Barium Defendants injure Microsoft and its reputation, brand, and

goodwill. Users subject to the negative effects of the Barium Defendants' malicious applications
and actions incorrectly believe that Microsoft is the source of vulnerabilities and resultant
problems. Software updating, also known as supply chain attacks, significantly threaten the

Microsoft ecosystem. Advice to customers to patch systems has been strongly advocated and
communicated by Microsoft. The use of the supply chain attack vector, through software updates
(discussed above in paragraphs 20-21), introduces a significant issue that appears to contradict
Microsoft's guidance and therefore irreparably injures Microsoft and its reputation, brand, and
goodwill.
