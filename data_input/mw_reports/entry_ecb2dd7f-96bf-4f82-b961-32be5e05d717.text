ESET research reveals notorious crime group also conducting espionage campaigns for the
past five years
The Buhtrap group is well known for its targeting of financial institutions and businesses in
Russia. However, since late 2015, we have witnessed an interesting change in its traditional
targets. From a pure criminal group perpetrating cybercrime for financial gain, its toolset has
been expanded with malware used to conduct espionage in Eastern Europe and Central
Asia.
Throughout our tracking, we’ve seen this group deploy its main backdoor as well as other
tools against various victims, but June 2019 was the first time we saw the Buhtrap group
use a zero-day exploit as part of a campaign. In that case, we observed Buhtrap using a
local privilege escalation exploit, CVE-2019-1132, against one of its victims.
The exploit abuses a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft Windows,
specifically a NULL pointer dereference in the win32k.sys component. Once the exploit was
discovered and analyzed, it was reported to the Microsoft Security Response Center, who
promptly fixed the vulnerability and released a patch.
This blog post covers the evolution of Buhtrap from a financial crime to an espionage
mindset.

History
The timeline in Figure 1 highlights some of the most important developments in Buhtrap
activity.

It is always difficult to attribute a campaign to a particular actor when their tools’ source
code is freely available on the web. However, as the shift in targets occurred before the
source code leak, we assess with high confidence that the same people behind the first
Buhtrap malware attacks against businesses and banks are also involved in targeting
governmental institutions.

Although new tools have been added to their arsenal and updates applied to older ones, the
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in the different Buhtrap campaigns have
not changed dramatically over all these years. They still make extensive use of NSIS
installers as droppers and these are mainly delivered through malicious documents. Also,
several of their tools are signed with valid code-signing certificates and abuse a known,
legitimate application to side-load their malicious payloads.
The documents employed to deliver the malicious payloads often come with benign decoy
documents to avoid raising suspicions if the victim opens them. The analysis of these decoy
documents provides clues about who the targets might be. When Buhtrap was targeting
businesses, the decoy documents would typically be contracts or invoices. Figure 2 is a
typical example of a generic invoice the group used in a campaign in 2014.

When the group’s focus shifted to banks, the decoy documents were related to banking
system regulations or advisories from FinCERT, an organization created by the Russian
government to provide help and guidance to its financial institutions (such as the example in
Figure 3).

Hence, when we first saw decoy documents related to government operations, we
immediately started to track these new campaigns. One of the first malicious samples
showing such a change was noticed in December 2015. It downloaded an NSIS installer
whose role was to install the main Buhtrap backdoor, but the decoy document – seen in
Figure 4 – was intriguing.

The URL in the text is revealing. It is very similar to the State Migration Service of Ukraine
website, dmsu.gov.ua. The text, in Ukrainian, asks employees to provide their contact
information, especially their email addresses. It also tries to convince them to click on the
malicious domain included in the text.
This was the first of many malicious samples we encountered being used by the Buhtrap
group to target government institutions . Another, more recent decoy document that we
believe was also distributed by the Buhtrap group is seen in Figure 5 – a document which
would appeal to a very different set of people, but still government-related.

Analysis of the targeted campaigns leading to zero-day usage
The tools used in the espionage campaigns were very similar to those used against
businesses and financial institutions. One of the first malicious samples we analyzed that
targeted governmental organizations was a sample with SHA-1 hash
2F2640720CCE2F83CA2F0633330F13651384DD6A. This NSIS installer downloads the
regular package containing the Buhtrap backdoor and displays the decoy document shown
in Figure 4.
Since then, we’ve seen several different campaigns against governmental organizations
coming from this group. In these, they were routinely using vulnerabilities to elevate their
privileges in order to install their malware. We’ve seen them exploit old vulnerabilities such
as CVE-2015-2387. However, they were always known vulnerabilities. The zero-day they
used recently was part of the same pattern: using it so that they could run their malware
with the highest privileges.
Throughout the years, packages with different functionalities appeared. Recently, we found
two new packages that are worth describing as they deviate from the typical toolset.

Legacy backdoor with a twist –
E0F3557EA9F2BA4F7074CAA0D0CF3B187C4472FF
This document contains a malicious macro that, when enabled, drops an NSIS installer
whose task is to prepare installation of the main backdoor. However, this NSIS installer is
very different from the earlier versions used by this group. It is much simpler and is only
used to set the persistence and launch two malicious modules embedded within it.
The first module, called “grabber” by its author, is a standalone password stealer. It tries to
harvest passwords from mail clients, browsers, etc., and sends them to a C&C server. This
module was also detected as part of the campaign using the zero-day. This module uses
standard Windows APIs to communicate with its C&C server.

The second module is something that we have come to expect from Buhtrap operators: an
NSIS installer containing a legitimate application that will be abused to side-load the
Buhtrap main backdoor. The legitimate application that is abused in this case is AVZ, a free
anti-virus scanner.

Meterpreter and DNS tunneling –
C17C335B7DDB5C8979444EC36AB668AE8E4E0A72
This document contains a malicious macro that, when enabled, drops an NSIS installer
whose task is to prepare installation of the main backdoor. Part of the installation process is
to set up firewall rules to allow the malicious component to communicate with the C&C
server. Next is a command example the NSIS installer uses to set up these rules:
cmd.exe /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\”Realtek HD Audio Update Utility\”
dir=in action=allow program=\”<path>\RtlUpd.exe\” enable=yes profile=any
However, the final payload is something that we have never seen associated with Buhtrap.
Encrypted in its body are two payloads. The first one is a very small shellcode downloader,
while the second one is Metasploit’s Meterpreter. Meterpreter is a reverse shell that grants

its operators full access to the compromised system.
The Meterpreter reverse shell actually uses DNS tunnelling to communicate with its C&C
server by using a module similar to what is described here. Detecting DNS tunnelling can
be difficult for defenders, since all malicious traffic is done via the DNS protocol, as opposed
to the more regular TCP protocol. Below is a snippet of the initial communication of this
malicious module.
7812.reg0.4621.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
7812.reg0.5173.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
7812.reg0.5204.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
7812.reg0.5267.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
7812.reg0.5314.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
7812.reg0.5361.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
[…]
The C&C server domain name in this example is impersonating Microsoft. In fact, the
attackers registered different domain names for these campaigns, most of them abusing
Microsoft brands in one way or another.

Conclusion
While we do not know why this group has suddenly shifted targets, it is a good example of
the increasingly blurred lines between pure espionage groups and those primarily involved
in crimeware activities. In this case, it is unclear if one or several members of this group
decided to change focus and for what reasons, but it is definitely something that we are
likely to see more of going forward.
