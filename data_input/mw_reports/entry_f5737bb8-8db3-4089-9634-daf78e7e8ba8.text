Threatening U.S. Election Officials
fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/iranian-cyber-actors-responsible-for-website-threatening-us-election-officials

The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) possess highly
credible information indicating Iranian cyber actors almost certainly were responsible for the
creation of a website called Enemies of the People, which contained death threats aimed at
U.S. election officials in mid-December 2020.
The FBI has identified multiple domains, to include the main site, enemiesofthepeople.org,
that contained personal information and photographs for a number of U.S. officials and
individuals from private sector entities involved with the 2020 election. The FBI has
confirmed the main site is currently inactive.
In addition, threatening emails were sent to the officials from the following email addresses:
enemiesofthepeople@tutanota.com
6e.nemiesOfThepeople.e9@protonmail.com
3e.nemiesOfThePeopl.e3@protonmail.com
3e.nemiesOfThePeopl.e3@gmail.com
The post-election creation of the Enemies of the People website demonstrates an ongoing
Iranian intent to create divisions and mistrust in the United States and undermine public
confidence in the U.S. electoral process. As referenced in Joint Cybersecurity
Advisories AA20-296B and AA20-304A, and FBI FLASH Message ME-000138-TT, the FBI
and CISA have previously warned that Iranian cyber actors were likely intent on influencing
and interfering with the 2020 U.S. elections.
The FBI and CISA urge the public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they
consume and to seek out reliable and verified information.
The FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious
cyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. The FBI
also investigates federal election crimes and violent crimes, including threats of violence
against U.S. election or other public officials. CISA is responsible for protecting the nationâ€™s
critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats.
The FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the security, integrity, and
resiliency of the U.S. electoral process. The FBI will continue to aggressively investigate
credible threats made against U.S. election officials through any media, including websites
and telephonic or electronic communications.
