Our past article has presented a bug in malware “TSCookie”, which is reportedly used by
BlackTech attack group. This article is to update the features of the malware.
Even after we published the blog article in October 2018, the adversary had continued using
the malware as it was. Just in May 2019, we confirmed that the malware had its bug fixed
and was used in some attack cases.

Details of the fix
The malware copies its configuration to the memory. In the previous version, the data size to
be copied was incorrectly set, which resulted in the configuration not displayed properly (see
the article for more details). In the updated version, the data size is set to 0x1000 instead of
0x8D4.

This update enables TSCookie to decode the configuration correctly. Fig 2 is the comparison
of decoded configuration. This update has also fixed the issue where the malware fails to
reconnect to a C&C server for a few days.

In closing
As we pointed out before, it is likely that adversaries also follow publications and blogs from
security vendors, etc. We assume that the adversary recognised the bug on our blog and
fixed the issue accordingly. If we see any updates on the malware, we will introduce them
here.
Hash values of the samples described in the article are listed in Appendix A, along with C&C
servers in Appendix B. Please make sure that none of your devices is accessing these hosts.
Thank you for reading.
