PROMETHIUM extends global reach with StrongPity3 APT
blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/promethium-extends-with-strongpity3.html

By Warren Mercer, Paul Rascagneres and Vitor Ventura.

News summary
The threat actor behind StrongPity is not deterred despite being exposed multiple
times over the past four years.
They continue to expand their victimology and attack seemingly non related
countries.
This kind of continuous improvement suggests there is a possibility that this is an
exported solution for other actors to use.

Executive summary
The PROMETHIUM threat actor — active since 2012 — has been exposed multiple times
over the past several years.. However, this has not deterred this actor from continuing
and expanding their activities. By matching indicators such as code similarity, command
and control (C2) paths, toolkit structure and malicious behavior, Cisco Talos identified
around 30 new C2 domains. We assess that PROMETHIUM activity corresponds to five
peaks of activity when clustered by the creation date month and year.

What's new?
Talos telemetry shows that PROMETHIUM is expanding its reach and attempts to infect
new targets across several countries. The samples related to StrongPity3 targeted victims
in Colombia, India, Canada and Vietnam. The group has at least four new trojanized

setup files we observed: Firefox (a browser), VPNpro (a VPN client), DriverPack (a pack
of drivers) and 5kPlayer (a media player).

How did it work?
Talos could not pinpoint the initial attack vector, however, the use of trojanized
installation files to well-known applications is consistent with the previously documented
campaigns. This leads us to believe that just like in the past, the initial vector may be
either a watering hole attack or in-path request interception like mentioned in a
CitizenLab report from 2018.
The trojanized setup will install the malware and the legitimate application, which is a
good way to disguise its activities. In some cases, it will reconfigure Windows Defender
before dropping the malware to prevent detection.

So what?
This group mainly focuses on espionage, and these latest campaigns continue down the
same path. The malware will exfiltrate any Microsoft Office file it encounters on the
system. Previous research even linked PROMETHIUM to state-sponsored threats. The
fact that the group does not refrain from launching new campaigns even after being
exposed shows their resolve to accomplish their mission.
PROMETHIUM has been resilient over the years. Its campaigns have been exposed
several times, but that was not enough to make the actors behind it to make them stop.

2019-2020 Campaigns
Potential infection vectors
Despite the numbers of samples and the quantity of C2 servers, Cisco Talos did not
identify the infection vectors. We have no evidence that the websites of the real
applications were compromised to host the malicious installer. The infection vector does
not seem to be related to a supply-chain attack, either.
Based on the previous research from CitizenLab and the artifacts from the new
campaigns, we estimate that the infection vector could be the same as in 2018. When the
targeted users tried to download a legitimate application on the official website, the ISP
performs an HTTP redirect. For more information about the methodology used in the
past, we recommend reading the paper from CitizenLab.

New victimology
The report from CitizenLab highlights the intervention of service providers during the
initial attack vector implying state support. It also refers to the change from FinSpy, a
well-known malware developed by a lawful interception company, to StrongPity2. At the
time, they concluded that most of the victims were in Turkey and Syria.

Our research indicates that the victims are now in many different regions of the world.

Countries affected by StrongPity
The many different versions of the malware, coupled with the fact that the domains are
hardcoded indicates that a tool such as a Builder is used to generate the binaries. We can
conclude that the PROMETHIUM threat actor is interested in new countries or the
malicious framework developed by this threat actor is exported in more countries than
previously thought.

Trojanized Firefox Installer
One interesting detail, which is aligned with CitizenLab's claim that Turkish people were
the most targeted, is the Turkish language version of the Firefox Installer.

C2 infrastructure
Talos has identified at least three different campaigns since July 2019. We clustered the
campaigns based on the domain creation date.

Domain clusters
The fact we clustered these into different campaigns does not mean that they have been
conducted sequentially. In fact, our analysis of each domain showed that these are
overlapping campaigns — some of them going back to 2018.

Domain activity timeline
Some of these domains may already be sinkholed, thus posing no threat. However, the
fact that the number of hits is still high shows that the infection vectors are still active. It
is interesting to note that this threat actor uses HTTPS on the C2. They always use selfsigned certificates.

Main differences between StrongPity2 and StrongPity3
StrongPity3 is the evolution of StrongPity2, with a few differences. The latter does not use
libcurl anymore and now uses winhttp to perform all requests to C2. The usage of the
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry key has a persistence
mechanism that has been replaced by the creation of a service. This service changes its
name from package to package. The service executable's only job is to launch the C2
contact module upon service startup. The remaining malware flow is the same on both
versions.
The dropped files are now stored in a folder located in C:\DOCUME~1\
<USER>~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\ always following the same pattern similar to the
following: 4CA-B25C11-A27BC. The C2 path pattern has also changed, we have identified
the following paths: ini.php, info.php and parse_ini_file.php, which are no longer
random nor animal named based.

Malware
Trojanized applications
We found four different trojaned binaries in use since July 2019. The 5kplayer, driver
pack and Firefox trojanized software use a service to achieve persistence. The VPNpro
trojanized application uses an AutoRun registry key, as mentioned in the publication
released before July 2019.

Anti-virus checks on Firefox trojanized installer
Before writing the toolkit into the hard drive, the fake Firefox installer executes a
PowerShell command that will add the directories used by the malware to the Windows
Defender exclusions list and prevent sample submission at the same time. After that, it
will check if ESET or BitDefender antivirus are installed before dropping the malware. If
they are installed, nothing will be dropped.
We'll now break down the 5kplayer trojanized installer. The setup deploys three files
which are part of the toolset: rmaserv.exe, winprint32.exe and mssqldbserv.xml.

Execution flow
As the execution flow shows, the setup will only execute rmaserv.exe. The remaining
modules are executed by rmaserv.exe when this executable will be executed as a service.

The malicious service: rmaserv.exe
This binary has two main features. If it is executed with the "help" parameter, it will
install a service to execute itself as a service. This parameter is used by the trojanized
installer. Here is the code to perform this task:

rmaserv.exe entry function
This follows the design pattern described in the Microsoft Windows documentation,
which can be found here. This has a notable side effect: if rmaserv.exe is executed isolated
on a sandbox (so without the parameter), the service is not created. Consequently, the
execution won't do anything and the dynamic analysis will be skewed.
The second main feature is the service. This service has two features. First, it will launch
the winprint32.exe executable (C2 contact module) and then it will wait for an event. This
event is the mechanism used by the C2 contact module to alert the service executable to
perform the cleaning of all components.

C2 contact module: winprint32.exe
Regularly, the service checks if a user is logged, by checking if Explorer is running. Once
explorer.exe is running, the service configures the environment and executes the C2
contact module: winprint32.exe.
This module is responsible for launching the document search module, contact the C2
and exfiltrate the collected documents. It will create a mutex with the name
"YeucqCcpgapiZISEdRSNiL". Afterward, it will launch two processes:
C:\DOCUME~1\<USER>~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\4CA-B25C11A27BC\mssqldbserv.xml
C:\DOCUME~1\<USER>~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\4CA-B25C11-A27BC\wintasks.xml

Mutex creation
Then, it will start an infinite loop. The first step inside the loop is to contact the C2 over
HTTPS. On the first contact, it will send an identification of the victim based on the hard
disk volume serial number.

Contact C2 loop
After a 6,050- milliseconds delay, it will search
for "sft" files (the encoded archive containing the
documents to be exfiltrated), which will then be
exfiltrated to the C2.
Afterward, it will sleep for another 6,050
milliseconds before restarting. This module can
be executed independently of the rest of the
toolkit. Talos didn't identify any kind of anti-sandboxing mechanisms on it, either.

Document search module: Mssqldbserv.xml
This module has been described before in the article here. The purpose of this tool is to
parse the hard drive for files with a specific extension and create an archive with these
files. Finally, the archive is encoded before being sent to the C2.

mssqldbserv.xml main function
However, there are some interesting details we decided to share. Clearly, this was not
originally designed to be executed in the background. The first instructions in the main
function hide the console window from the user. Afterward, the module will delete old
"sft" files assuming they were already exfiltrated. After a pause of 6,500 milliseconds, it
will start its search for the targeted files.

SFT file creation routine
Using the working directory as a base path, which in this sample case is C:\DOCUME~1\
<USER>~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\4CA-B25C11-A27BC\, each selected file will be
compressed into the file kr.zp. The kr.zp data is then read and encoded using the same
unusual encoded scheme.
byte = byte XOR (byte >> 4)

If the file is larger than 2048*53 bytes (~ 106kb) it is split into chunks and saved into the
sft files according to the naming convention below.
gui_app0_[VolumeSerialNumber]_[MonthDayHourMinuteSecondMilliseconds]_[Counter].sft

Since this module does not have a loop, it will only be executed at the communications
module startup, which means that it is only executed once per service start.

Mysterious Wintask.xml
Our initial analysis in a sandbox showed that the C2 contact module attempts to execute
this file, searching for it in the same path as the document search module, which we
further corroborated with manual analysis. However, we couldn't obtain this file. All files
in the toolkit are dropped by the trojanized software and it's clear that the C2 contact
module expects this file to exist (the specific name changes form dropper to dropper).
None of the trojanized software we analyzed dropped this file, manual analysis showed
that there were no checks to decide whether to drop it. One possibility is that these are
remains of old code that was abandoned in the meantime.

Conclusion
The PROMETHIUM threat actor is dedicated and resilient, exposing them hasn't
refrained them from moving forward with their agenda. After first being documented,
they changed their toolkit but not their techniques or procedures. Since then, their toolkit
has been the same, with just enough updates to keep their activities as efficient as
possible. During this period, the victimology has expanded behind their initial focus in
Europe and Middle East to a global operation targeting organizations on most continents.
These characteristics can be interpreted as signs that this threat actor could in fact be part
of an enterprise service for hire operation. We believe this has hallmarks a professionally
packaged solution due to the similarity of each piece of malware being extremely similar
but used across different targets with minor changes.
Additionally, as explained by Citizen Lab, we saw in the past a lawful Interception tool
was used instead of StrongPity. This usage could corroborate our theory.
