CactusPete (also known as Karma Panda or Tonto Team) is an APT group that has been
publicly known since at least 2013. Some of the group’s activities have been previously
described in public by multiple sources. We have been investigating and privately
reporting on this group’s activity for years as well. Historically, their activity has been
focused on military, diplomatic and infrastructure targets in Asia and Eastern Europe.
This is also true of the group’s latest activities.
A new CactusPete campaign, spotted at the end of February 2020 by Kaspersky, shows
that the group’s favored types of target remain the same. The victims of the new variant of
the Bisonal backdoor, according to our telemetry, were from financial and military sectors
located in Eastern Europe. Our research started from only one sample, but by using the
Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine (KTAE) we found 300+ almost identical samples.
All of them appeared between March 2019 and April 2020. This underlines the speed of
CactusPete’s development – more than 20 samples per month. The target location forced
the group to use a hardcoded Cyrillic codepage during string manipulations. This is
important, for example, during remote shell functionality, to correctly handle the Cyrillic
output from executed commands.
The method of malware distribution for the new campaign remains unknown, but
previous campaigns indicate that it’s their usual way of distributing malware. The
attackers’ preferred way to deliver malware is spear-phishing messages with “magic”
attachments. The attachments never contain zero-day exploits, but they do include
recently discovered and patched vulnerabilities, or any other crafty approaches that might
help them deliver the payload. Running these attachments leads to infection.
Once the malware starts it tries to reach a hardcoded C2. The communication takes place
using the unmodified HTTP-based protocol, the request and response body are RC4encrypted, and the encryption key is also hardcoded into the sample. As the result of the
RC4 encryption may contain binary data, the malware additionally encodes it in BASE64,
to match the HTTP specification.

The handshake consists of several steps: initial request, victim network details and a more
detailed victim information request. This is the complete list of victim specific
information that is sent to the C2 during the handshake steps:
Hostname, IP and MAC address;
Windows version;
Time set on infected host;

Flags that indicates if the malware was executed on VMware environment;
Proxy usage flag;
System default CodePage Identifier;
After the handshake has been completed, the backdoor waits for a command, periodically
pinging the C2 server. The response body from the C2 ping might hold the command and
parameters (optionally). The updated Bisonal backdoor version maintains functionality
similar to past backdoors built from the same codebase:
Execute a remote shell;
Silently start a program on a victim host;
Retrieve a list of processes from the victim host;
Terminate any process;
Upload/Download/Delete files to/from victim host;
Retrieve a list of available drives from the victim host;
Retrieve a filelist of a specified folder from the victim host;
This is what it looks like in code.

This set of remote commands helps the attackers study the victim environment for lateral
movement and deeper access to the target organization. The group continues to push
various custom Mimikatz variants and keyloggers for credential harvesting purposes,
along with privilege escalation malware.

What are they looking for?
Since the malware contains mostly information gathering functionality, most likely they
hack into organizations to gain access to the victims’ sensitive data. If we recall that
CactusPete targets military, diplomatic and infrastructure organizations, the information
could be very sensitive indeed.
We would suggest the following countermeasures to prevent such threats:
Network monitoring, including unusual behavior detection;

CactusPete activity
CactusPete is a Chinese-speaking cyber-espionage APT group that uses medium-level
technical capabilities, and the people behind it have upped their game. They appear to
have received support and have access to more complex code like ShadowPad, which
CactusPete deployed in 2020. The group’s activity has been recorded since at least 2013,
although Korean public resources mark an even earlier date – 2009. Historically,
CactusPete targets organizations within a limited range of countries – South Korea,
Japan, the US and Taiwan. Last year’s campaigns show that the group has shifted towards
other Asian and Eastern European organizations.
Here’s an overview of CactusPete activity in recent years, based on Kaspersky research
results:
May 2018: a new wave of targeted attacks abusing CVE-2018-8174 (this exploit has
been associated with the DarkHotel APT group, as described on Securelist), with
diplomatic, defense, manufacturing, military and government targets in Asia and
Eastern Europe;
December 2018 and early 2019: Bisonal backdoor modification with a set of spying
payloads in a campaign targeting organizations within mining, defense, government
and technology research targets in Eastern Europe and Asia;
September and October 2019: a DoubleT backdoor campaign, targeting militaryrelated and unknown victims;
March 2019 to April 2020: Bisonal backdoor modification in a campaign targeting
organizations in financial and military institutions in Eastern Europe;
December 2019 to April 2020: a modified DoubleT backdoor campaign, targeting
telecom and governmental organizations and other victims in Asia and Eastern
Europe;
Late 2019 and 2020: CactusPete started to deploy ShadowPad malware with victims
including government organizations, energy, mining, and defense bodies and
telcoms located in Asia and Eastern Europe;
Known alternative names for this APT group:
CactusPete, Karma Panda, Tonto Team
Known alternative names for the different payloads used:
Bisonal, Curious Korlia, DoubleT, DOUBLEPIPE, CALMTHORNE

We call CatusPete an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, but the Bisonal code we
analyzed is not that advanced. Yet, interestingly, the CactusPete APT group has had
success without advanced techniques, using plain code without complicated obfuscation
and spear-phishing messages with “magic” attachments as the preferred method of
distribution. Of course, the group does continuously modify the payload code, studies the
suggested victim in order to craft a trustworthy phishing email, sends it to an existing
email address in the targeted company and makes use of new vulnerabilities and other
methods to inconspicuously deliver the payload once an attachment has been opened.
The infection occurs, not because of advanced technologies used during the attack, but
because of those who view the phishing emails and open the attachments. Companies
need to conduct spear-phishing awareness training for employees in order to improve
their computer security knowledge.
