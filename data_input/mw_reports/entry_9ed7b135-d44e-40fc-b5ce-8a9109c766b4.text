EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Nisos operators investigated links between the Coldriver group (aka SEABORGIUM) and the Russian
Government. The Coldriver Group, also known as Callisto and SEABORGIUM, is a Russia-based
espionage threat actor group known to attack government organizations, think tanks, and journalists in
Europe and the Caucasus regions through spearphishing and hack-and-leak campaigns.
Nisos investigated PII selectors associated with domains used in recent Coldriver Group activity in order
to identify further selectors and identify links between the Russian Government and the Coldriver
Group. Investigators traced a selector back to an individual named Andrey Korinets.
Andrey Stanislavovich Korinets (Коринец Андрей Станиславович), through a company email
address, it@ugs[.]center, is linked to LLC UHTAGAZSERVICE (ООО УХТАГАЗСЕРВИС), a Russian
company that contracts with Russian governmental entities.
Korinets is currently employed by Trustlink, an SEO exchange that has been operating in the internet
marketing and SEO industry since 2008, while still residing in Syktyvkar. The email address used by his
VK account was used as the contact email address for an ezine published by the hacker underground in
Syktyvkar.1 He is currently employed by Trustlink[.]ru.
This organization is an “exchange of trusted links and unique articles,” used for sharing links between
web site owners and advertisers and is built on top of the SEOPult[.]pro marketing platform. It is
possible that the Coldriver group is using Trustlink infrastructure or the SEOPult platform to build out
their phishing infrastructure. 23
Two email addresses, cp.regname@googlemail[.]com and vladimirdj90@gmail[.]com, attributed to
Korinets, provided reviews for Syktyvkar-based Lavina Private Security Company (Лавина Частное
Охранное Предприятие).
While researchers identified no indication of Korinets’ employment with Lavina, the company hires
former Russian military and intelligence personnel to address clients’ physical and technical security as
well as security alarm response.
Researchers also identified two individuals, Andrey Georgievich Yushkov (Юшков Андрей
Георгиевич) and Alexey Valerievich Doguzhiev (Догужиев Алексей Валерьевич) through email
addresses andrey_usk@mail[.]ru and vladimirdj90@gmail[.]com respectively that appear to be shared
with Andrey Korinets.
The email it@ugs[.]center is linked to ООО УХТАГАЗСЕРВИС (LLC UHTAGAZSERVICE), a Komi,
Ukhta-based company that conducts business spanning from construction to natural resources

infrastructure, according to Russian corporate data and the company website.4 5 LLC UHTAGAZSERVICE,
INN 1102073810, has had seven government contracts totaling more than 100 million Rubles, one of
which was with the government administration SE “Sosnogorsk”, according to the same Russian
corporate record.6 Efforts to identify a connection between Andrey and LLC UHTAGAZSERVICE other
than the it@ugs[.]center email provided no results.
Efforts to definitively determine whether the actors are a network of individuals or an individual
provided inconclusive results.

Andrey Stanislavovich Korinets
Researchers identified a possible legal name for Andrey Korinets and potential name spelling variants;
Коринец Андрей Станиславович (Korinets Andrey Stanislavovich) and Корипец Андрей
Станиславович (Koripets Andrey Stanislavovich). Based on shared selector data, we judge Korinets
and Koripets are the same person.
