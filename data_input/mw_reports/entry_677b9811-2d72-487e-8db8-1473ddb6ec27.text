Abstract
The 2000 Maroochy Shire cyber event is the second in a series of control system cyber
events analyzed to determine the effectiveness of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53
controls on industrial control systems. The event has been documented in Court
proceedings, a Maroochy Water Services presentation, and other documentation available
in the public domain. The event was an intentional, targeted attack by a knowledgeable
person on an industrial control system. The case study examines the event from a cyber
security perspective. It provides the timelines and cyber issues, examines the NIST
SP800-53 controls that were violated or not met, and posits the potential mitigation that
would have occurred if the NIST SP800-53 controls had been followed. The intent of
this analysis is not to criticize any actions taken, but to look forward as to how lessons
learned from this case can be of help to prevent future incidents.

Attack Overview
Vitek Boden, a man in his late 40s, worked for Hunter Watertech, an Australian firm that
installed SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) radio-controlled sewage
equipment for the Maroochy Shire Council in Queensland, Australia. Boden applied for
a job with the Maroochy Shire Council, apparently after he walked away from a “strained
relationship” with Hunter Watertech. The Council decided not to hire him.
Consequently, Boden decided to get even with both the Council and his former employer.
He packed his car with stolen radio equipment attached to a (possibly stolen) computer.
He drove around the area on at least 46 occasions from February 28 to April 23, 2000,
issuing radio commands to the sewage equipment he (probably) helped install. Boden
caused 800,000 liters of raw sewage to spill out into local parks, rivers and even the
grounds of a Hyatt Regency hotel. "Marine life died, the creek water turned black and
the stench was unbearable for residents," said a representative of the Australian
Environmental Protection Agency. 2 Boden coincidentally got caught when a policeman
pulled him over for a traffic violation after one of his attacks. A judge sentenced him to
two years in jail and ordered him to reimburse the Council for cleanup. Boden's attack
became the first widely known example of someone maliciously breaking into a control
system. There are a few other reports of this attack. Slay and Miller, “Lessons Learned
From the Maroochy Water Breach” 3 refer to a non-public analytic report by the civil

Introduction
This case study analyzes the event to determine how the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 controls might have prevented
or mitigated the event. The intent of this analysis is not to criticize any actions taken, but
to look forward as to how lessons learned from this case can be of help to prevent future
incidents.
The Maroochy Shire attack has been documented in the Crown criminal case 5 . The
offences occurred between 9 February 2000 and 23 April 2000 when Vitek Boden
accessed computers controlling the Maroochy Shire Council’s sewerage system and
altered electronic data in the sewerage pumping stations causing malfunctions in their
operations.

NIST Special Publication 800-53 and Related Documents
NIST has established an Industrial Control System (ICS) Security Project 6 to improve the
security of public and private sector ICS. NIST SP 800-53 revision 2, December 2007,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, provides
implementing guidance and detail in the context of two mandatory Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS) that apply to all federal information and information
systems, including ICSs. FIPS 200 requires that federal agencies implement minimum
security controls for their organizational information systems based on the FIPS 199
security categorization of those systems. Private sector and other organizations may
consider the use of these standards and guidelines as appropriate. NIST is working with
all stakeholders and other interested parties to develop convergent guidance on the
application of these security requirements to ICS.
Revision 2 of SP 800-53 incorporates guidance on appropriate safeguards and
countermeasures for federal ICS, that is also potentially applicable and useful for the
private sector. NIST’s Computer Security Division (Information Technology
Laboratory) and Intelligent Systems Division (Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory),
in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security and organizations within the
federal government that own, operate, and maintain industrial control systems, developed
the necessary ICS augmentations and interpretations for the security controls, control
enhancements, and supplemental guidance in SP 800-53. The ICS augmentations and
interpretations will facilitate the employment of appropriate safeguards and

countermeasures for these specialized information systems that are part of the critical
infrastructure of the United States.
In developing the ICS augmentations and interpretations, the original set of controls,
enhancements, and supplemental guidance contained in Appendix F in SP 800-53 were
not changed. ICS Supplemental Guidance provides additional guidance on how to apply
a control in ICS environments. ICS Enhancements are enhancement augmentations to
the controls that are required for some ICS. ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance
provides guidance on how to apply an enhancement in ICS environments.
FIPS Publication 199 provides standards for categorizing information and information
systems based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events occur
which jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to
accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities,
maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Categorization of an
information system must take into consideration potential impacts to other organizations
and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security
Presidential Directives, potential national-level impacts.
The security controls specified in SP 800-53 are organized into classes and families for
ease of use in the control selection and specification process. There are three general
classes of security controls (i.e., management, operational, and technical) and seventeen
security control families. 7 Each family contains security controls related to the security
functionality of the family. A two-character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify
each control family. Table 1 summarizes the classes and families in the security control
catalog and the associated family identifiers. A list of the minimum security controls, or
security control baselines, for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information
systems, as determined by applying the criteria in FIPS 199 have been published
separately: LOW-impact baseline at sp800-53-rev2-annex1.pdf; MODERATE-impact
baseline at sp800-53-rev2-annex2.pdf; and HIGH-impact baseline at sp800-53-rev2annex3.pdf. These are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex1.pdf, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex2.pdf, and http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex3.pdf, respectively.

7

The seventeen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are closely aligned with the seventeen
security-related areas in FIPS 200 specifying the minimum security requirements for protecting federal information and
information systems. Families are assigned to their respective classes based on the dominant characteristics of the
controls in that family. Many security controls, however, can be logically associated with more than one class. For
example, CP-1, the policy and procedures control from the Contingency Planning family, is listed as an operational
control but also has characteristics that are consistent with security management as well.

Maroochy Shire Site Description
Maroochy Shire, a rural area of great natural beauty and a tourist destination, is located
about 100 kilometers north of the Queensland State Capital of Brisbane. It has an area of
approximately 1,157 square kilometers with a population of approximately 120,000.
Maroochy Shire has 880 kilometers of gravity sewers treating an average of 35 million
liters/day. Maroochy Water Services Sewerage SCADA System consists of 142 Sewage
Pumping Stations with two Monitoring Computers utilizing three Radio Frequencies.
Hunter Watertech Pty Ltd installed the “PDS Compact 500” computer device at each
pumping station capable of receiving instructions from a central control center,
transmitting alarm signals and other data to the central computer and providing messages
to stop and start the pumps at the pumping station. Communications between pumping
stations and between a pumping station and the central computer were by means of a
dedicated analog two-way radio system operating through repeater stations. Each
repeater station transmitted on a different frequency.

The Attack
The offences occurred between February 9, 2000 and April 23, 2000. Vitek Boden
accessed computers controlling the Maroochy Shire Council’s sewerage system, altering
electronic data in particular sewerage pumping stations causing malfunctions in their
operations. Vitek Boden had been employed by Hunter Watertech as its site supervisor
on the Maroochy SCADA project for about two years until resigning in December 1999.
At about the time of his resignation he approached the Council seeking employment. He
was told to enquire again at a later date. He made another approach to the Council for
employment in January 2000 and was told that he would not be employed. The sewerage
system then experienced a series of faults:




Pumps were not running when they should have been
Alarms were not reporting to the central computer
A loss of communication between the central computer and various pumping
stations.

An employee of Hunter Watertech, Mr. Yager, was appointed to look into the problem.
He began monitoring and recording all signals, messages and traffic on the radio
network. As a result of his investigations he concluded that many of the problems being
experienced with the system resulted from human intervention rather than equipment
failure. Other technical experts shared his opinion. Further, the evidence revealed that
the problems associated with the attack ceased when Vitek Boden was arrested. On an
occasion during Mr. Yager’s investigations, he ascertained that pumping station 14
seemed to be the source of the messages corrupting the system. He physically checked
the pumping station and ascertained that it was working properly and bore no signs of
having been physically tampered with. He concluded that the source of the false
messages was a PDS Compact 500 computer with an address of 14 and he changed the
identification number of pumping station 14 to 3 so that any legitimate messages from
that station could be identified as coming from station 3. Conversely, any messages
coming from a station identifying itself as 14 would be known to be bogus.
On March 16, 2000, when malfunctions occurred in the system, Mr. Yager
communicated over the network with a bogus pump station 14 that was sending messages
to corrupt the system. He was temporarily successful in altering his program to exclude
the bogus messages but then had his computer shut out of the network for a short period.
The intruder was now using PDS identification number 1 to send messages. Further
problems then occurred as a result of a person gaining remote computer access to the
system and altering data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected
pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.
The central computer was unable to exercise proper control and, at great inconvenience
and expense, technicians had to be mobilized throughout the system to correct faults at
affected pumping stations. On one occasion, a pumping station overflowed causing raw
sewerage to escape.
On April 23, 2000, an intruder, by means of electronic messages, disabled alarms at four
pumping stations using the identification of pumping station 4. The intrusions began just
after 7:30 pm and concluded just after 9:00 pm. By this time Vitek Boden had fallen
under suspicion and was under surveillance. Police officers located a vehicle driven by
him. When Boden’s vehicle was pulled over and searched at around 10:00 pm, a PDS
Compact 500 computer, later identified in evidence as the property of Hunter Watertech,
was found, as was a laptop computer.
On examination it was found that the software to enable the laptop to communicate with
the PDS system through the PDS computer had been re-installed in the laptop on
February 29, 2000. The PDS Compact computer had been programmed to identify itself
as pump station 4 – the identification used by the intruder in accessing the Council
sewerage system earlier that night. The software program installed in the laptop was one

developed by Hunter Watertech for its use in changing configurations in the PDS
computers. There was evidence that this program was required to enable a computer to
access the Council’s sewerage system and had no other practical use. The unchallenged
evidence of Sergeant. Kingsley, a police computer expert, was that the program had been
used at least 31 times between April 7 and April 19 and that it was last used at 9:31 pm
on April 23, 2000. Also found in the car was a two-way radio set to the frequencies of
the repeater stations and the leads necessary to connect the PDS computer, the laptop and
the radio.
Mr. Yager and others gave evidence that the conduct of the person responsible for the
unauthorized interventions in the computer system displayed a detailed familiarity with
the system, beyond that which was likely to be held even by Council technical staff.
Technical experts other than Mr. Yager also gave evidence that the computer
malfunctions, the subject of the charges, were the result of human intervention. When
apprehended by police Boden asserted in a taped conversation that all the items in the
vehicle were his own. He said he had been up to Rainbow Beach and that he used the
computer for study, personal correspondence and work in his family business. He later
sent a letter to the police requesting the immediate return of his property. Examination of
the laptop found in the car revealed start up and shut down times (on and after February
28, 2000) consistent with the time of the attacks which Mr. Yager had uncovered and
which he had logged.
The existence of other problems in the system showed that the malfunctions were the
result of human intervention. Once it was demonstrated that the malfunctions resulted
from human intervention, the existence of other problems became of limited significance.
Mr. Yager was adamant that the malfunctions in the system could only have been caused
by unauthorized human intervention.
Boden sought to establish that some of the electronic messages that gave rise to the
charges could have been caused by system malfunction or by error on the part of Council
employees. One of his arguments in this regard showed three sets of identical messages
on the same day from addresses 000, 099 and 004. The Crown contended that only the
message emanating from address 004 was initiated by Boden. Boden pointed to the other
messages as evidence that defective messages of the nature of those relied on by the
Crown may have been caused other than by human intervention.
Another witness, Mr. Lewer–an engineer specializing in computer engineering who, for a
time, was Hunter Watertech’s project engineer on the installation of the computerized
sewerage system– said that all three messages were generated by the PDS configuration
program used on the PDS Compact computers. Mr. Lewer’s opinion was that the
messages, other than the ones from address 004, were generated by persons attempting to
rectify the result of the alleged unauthorized intervention. He also gave evidence that
that 000 and 099 messages were not causing damage to the computer system. Mr. Yager
gave evidence some days later than Mr. Lewer and thus had more opportunity to consider
the possible explanations for the 000 and 099 messages. His evidence was that these
messages occurred over several days and resulted from the actions of maintenance staff

who were either employees of Hunter Watertech or Council employees under direction of
the former. He ruled out the possibility of mechanical error. He said that the 004
messages were definitely generated by a person different from the one who generated the
other messages.

Evidence
The counts on which Boden was found guilty related to acts of cyber penetration which
commenced on or about February 28, 2000.
• The laptop taken by the police from Boden’s vehicle had been reloaded with most
of its software operating programs on February 28, 2000
• PDS software file had been installed or re-installed on the laptop on February 29
at 3:46 pm. This is the software used to run or access the computers in the
sewerage system.
o Run at least 31 times prior to April 19
o Last run on April 23
• Two-way radio was of the type used in the Council’s communication system.
o Tuned into the frequencies of the repeater stations
o Serial numbers on the radio matched delivery docket provided by the
supplier of the radios to Hunter Watertech.
• PDS Compact 500
o Address set to 004
o Serial number identified it as a device which should have been in the
possession of Hunter Watertech.

Attack Summary
•

Vitek Boden was an insider who was never an employee of the organization he
attacked.
o He was an employee of a contractor that supplied IT/control system
technology to the Maroochy Shire Council.

7/23/2008 4:15 PM

o With his knowledge he was the “ultimate insider”.
• The service contract was deficient or inadequate concerning Watertech’s
responsibilities
o Management, technical and operational cyber security controls required
o Personnel security controls that applied to its employees such as
background investigations and protection from disgruntled employees
• A number of anomalous events occurred before recognition that the incidents
were intentional.
o As a skillful adversary, Boden was able to disguise his actions.
o Extensive digital forensics were required to determine that a deliberate
attack was underway
• There were no existing cyber security policies or procedures.
• There were no cyber security defenses.

Observations
As reported by Slay & Miller, Robert Stringfellow was the civil engineer in charge of the
water supply and sewage systems at Maroochy Water Services during the time of the
breach and has presented his analysis in closed forums. Stringfellow observed:
• At first it was easier to blame installation errors for the problems.
• Upon reinstalling all the software and checking the system, pump station
settings kept changing beyond the ability of the system to do this automatically
• Conclusion: an external malicious entity was using wireless equipment to access
the SCADA system.
Stringfellow's analysis of the incident made several important points:
• It is very difficult to protect against insider attacks.
• Radio communications commonly used in SCADA systems are generally insecure
or are improperly configured.
• SCADA devices and software should be secured to the extent possible using
physical and logical controls
• It is often that case that security controls are not implemented or are not used
properly
• SCADA systems must record all device accesses and commands, especially those
involving connections to or from remote sites; this requires fairly sophisticated
logging mechanisms.
Stringfellow also recommended the use of anti-virus and firewall protection along with
appropriate use of encryption. He emphasized a need for upgrade-able SCADA systems
(from a security perspective), proper staff training, and security auditing and control.

Applying SP 800-53 Controls
This case revolves around a disgruntled insider who was never an employee of the
organization he attacked. Some of the issues raised by analysis of this case are just being
addressed by cyber security practitioners 8 years later. Some are unresolved with no
solution in sight. .

All of Boden’s malicious activities are addressed by SP 800-53 controls, as detailed
below. Several pervasive prophylactic measures covered by SP 800-53 controls
immediately come to mind. These measures, not related to an specific malicious activity
are discussed first. Table 2 lists problems uncovered by the investigation into the attack
and the corresponding SP 800-53 control that could have prevented or mitigated it.

Policy and Procedures
Every organization should have cyber security policy and procedures. There are many
discretionary and judgmental activates that require guidance. Common sense isn’t
sufficient; dos and don’ts need to be written down.
Neither organization had cyber security policies or procedures in place. For example:
AC-18 Wireless Access Restrictions (i) establishes usage restrictions and implementation
guidance for wireless technologies; and (ii) authorizes, monitors, controls wireless access
to the information system.. Such policy would have addressed the two-way radio that
was used by Boden.
The first control in every control family addresses policy and procedure. With minor
variations, the control begins: “The organization develops, disseminates, and
periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal, documented, incident response policy that
addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination
among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures
to facilitate ….” Although enumerated for each control family, the family policy can be
included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Family
control procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a
particular information system, when required.

Personnel Security
Since Boden was never a Maroochy Council employee, direct hiring controls by the
Maroochy Council were technically not applicable. However, is it prudent for to have a
key personnel clause to protect the client from unilateral changes in key personnel by the
contractor. In general, the contract should extend applicable Personnel Security controls
to contractor employees. Determining which controls to apply to on-site contractor

personnel may not be easy since it depends on the role played by the individual. The
Personnel Security family (PS) contains the following controls:
PS-1

Personnel Security Policy and
Procedures

PS-5 Personnel Transfer

PS-2

Position Categorization

PS-6 Access Agreements

PS-3

Personnel Screening

PS-7 Third-Party Personnel Security

PS-4

Personnel Termination

PS-8 Personnel Sanctions

PS-7 identifies the need for contractual obligations on the subcontractor concerning
personnel security. Controls PS-3 and 4 should certainly be considered. In practice
many positions may be occupied by employees or contractors. The contractual
obligations should support equal treatment for direct employees and contractor
employees.

System and Services Acquisition
Hunter Watertech supplied hardware, software, and services to the Maroochy Shire
Council. The cyber security responsibilities of the contractor organization (e.g., Hunter
Watertech) and the contractor’s employees (e.g., Boden) should be included in the
contract between the organizations. Almost all of the controls applicable to direct
employees are also applicable to contractor employees, but the exact details may vary.
Many of these controls also obligate the contractor organization concerning record
keeping and other support services. Applicable security controls are in the System and
Services Acquisition family (SA) are listed below. There is no indication that any of
these controls were included in the contract between Hunter Watertech and Maroochy
Shire Council. All the controls are important; we believe that SA-4 and 11 might have
helped directly in in this case.

Awareness and Training
Personnel were not trained in preventing, recognizing, or responding to cyber-related
incidents. Security awareness and training inform personnel of the information security
risks associated with their activities and their responsibilities in complying with
organizational policies and procedures designed to reduce these risks. The Awareness
and Training family (AT) contains the following controls:
AT-1

Security Awareness and
Training Policy and Procedures

AT4

Security Training Records

AT-2

Security Awareness

AT-5 Contacts with Security Groups
and Associations

AT-3

Security Training

Every control except AT-5 could have helped in this case. NIST SP 800-50, Building an
Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, provides additional
information.

Audit
The Maroochy communications and control components lacked sufficient audit capability
to support fault determination or forensic analysis. Audit is concerned with collecting
information that is significant and relevant to the security of the information system.
Audit supports other control families such as incident response, access control, and flaw
remediation. The Audit and Accountability family (AU) contains the following controls:
AU-1

Contingency Planning
The analysis indicates that there were no plans to deal with an emergency or system
disruption. Effective contingency planning, execution, and testing are essential to
mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability. The Contingency Planning family
(CP) contains the following controls:

CP-10

Information System Recovery
and Reconstitution

CP-2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 apply to this case. NIST SP 800-34 provides guidance on
contingency planning.

Incident Response
Response to the sewerage discharge was ad hoc. Considerable time elapsed during
troubleshooting before malicious intent was considered. An incident response capability
is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating
the weaknesses that were exploited, restoring computing services, and apprehending
malefactors. Because performing incident response effectively is a complex undertaking,
establishing a successful incident response capability requires substantial planning and
resources. Establishing clear procedures for assessing the current and potential business
impact of incidents is critical, as is implementing effective methods of collecting,
analyzing, and reporting data. Building relationships and establishing suitable means of
communication with other internal groups (e.g., human resources, legal) and with
external groups (e.g., other incident response teams, law enforcement) are also vital. The
Incident Response family (IR) contains the following controls:
IR-1

Incident Response Policy and
Procedures

IR-5

Incident Monitoring

IR-2

Incident Response Training

IR-6

Incident Reporting

IR-3

Incident Response Testing and

IR-4

Incident Handling

All of these controls are applicable to the Maroochy system. NIST SP 800-61 provides
guidance on incident handling and reporting. NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on
malware incident handling and prevention.

Information Protection
Cryptography is employed as a protective mechanism for many objectives. A second line
of defense that was widely deployed only in 2006 was encryption protection of
information in stolen and lost devices.

7/23/2008 4:15 PM

The US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a policy memorandum in June
2006 8 , recommending safeguards for all federal government agencies. Safeguards
relevant to this case are:
 Encrypt all data on mobile computers/devices which carry agency data unless the
data is determined to be non-sensitive, in writing, by the Deputy Secretary or an
individual he/she may designate in writing.
 Allow remote access only with two-factor authentication where one of the factors
is provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access.
While this OMB policy was issued in response to loss or theft of devices containing
Personal Identification Information (PII), its phrasing encompasses protection of all
sensitive data and information. The specific intent of this policy is to compensate for the
protections offered by the physical security controls when information is removed from,
or accessed from outside of the agency location and when information is physically
transported outside of the agency’s secured, physical perimeter (this includes information
transported on removable media on portable/mobile devices such as laptop computers

The OMB policy is more explicit. This policy would have addressed the laptop and twoway radio that were in Boden's possession when he was arrested. However, since Boden
had reloaded the software and no data disclosure was involved, the practical impact is
little to none.

Malicious Activities
Table 3 lists Boden’s malicious activities and the corresponding SP 800-53 control that
could have prevented or mitigated it.

Access Control
Access Control is the process of granting or denying specific requests for obtaining and
using information and related information processing services. This is one of the
fundamental controls on any IT system. Most access controls are based on the identity of
the person, process, or device involved. Therefore, Identification and Authentication are
intimately tied with access control. Access controls need to be applied appropriate to the
communications environment.
Access controls are the first line of defense against error and omissions and malicious
attacks from insiders and outsiders. The Access Control family (AC) contains the
following controls:
AC-1

Multiple access controls would have alleviated or prevented the attack, including: AC-2
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT “The organization manages information system accounts,
including establishing, activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing
accounts…”; AC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT “The information system enforces assigned
authorizations for controlling access to the system in accordance with applicable policy.”;
AC-17 REMOTE ACCESS “The organization documents, monitors, and controls all methods of
remote access (e.g., dial-up, Internet) to the information system including remote access
for privileged functions….”; AC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS RESTRICTIONS “The organization: (i)
establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for wireless technologies; and
(ii) documents, monitors, and controls wireless access to the information system.” With
the enhancement “The organization uses authentication and encryption to protect wireless

access to the information system.”; and AC-20 USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS “the
organization restricts the use of personally owned information systems.”

Identification and Authentication
Identification is the process of determining the identity of a user, process, or device, and
authentication is the process of verifying the putative or claimed identity, often as a
prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system. The Identification
and Authentication family (IA) contains controls that would prevent unauthorized access
to the control system:
IA-1

IA-2

IA-5

IA-3

IA-2 USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION “The information system uniquely identifies

and authenticates users (or processes acting on behalf of users) … through the use of
passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some
combination therein….”; and IA-3 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION “The
information system identifies and authenticates specific devices before establishing a
connection, [using] either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC)
or Transmission Control Program/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addresses) or an
organizational authentication solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication
Protocol (EAP) or a Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS)
authentication)” are the primary controls. IA-4 and IA-5 provide management for the
parameters used.

Portable Device Protection
Part of defense-in-depth is recognizing that when some protections fail, there should be
more controls to help protect the organization. Theft of portable electronic equipment
occurs, often for the value of the equipment rather than the information stored. Boden’s
attack was an exception to this generality.
The control specified in MP-2, Media Access, is deceptively simple: “The organization
restricts access to information system media to authorized individuals.” Supplemental
guidance elaborates: “Information system media includes both digital media (e.g.,
diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact
disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control
also applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with
information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants,
cellular telephones). An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media
and associated information contained on that media requiring restricted access.

Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring restricted access,
individuals authorized to access the media, and the specific measures taken to restrict
access.”

System Monitoring
Another part of defense-in-depth is determining that something is going wrong. The
cause may be an intruder, often masquerading as an authorized user, or a malfunction. SI4 INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES “The organization employs tools
and techniques to monitor events on the information system, detect attacks, and provide
identification of unauthorized use of the system” provides a context for alerting personnel
of a suspected anomaly. If applied regularly and systematically, the type of forensics
performed by Hunter Watertech and the police might have detected the attack earlier.

Conclusions
The 2000 Maroochy Shire cyber event is important because it provides a public record of
an intentional, targeted attack by a knowledgeable person on an industrial control system.
The attack by an insider who is not an employee demonstrates several critical physical,
administrative, and supply chain vulnerabilities of industrial control systems. The key
issue is the treatment of vulnerabilities coming from suppliers or others outside the
organization. Contractor and sub-contractor personnel are often overlooked as a potential
attack source. The technical issues demonstrate the difficulty in identifying a control
system cyber attack and retaking control of a “hijacked” system. Once alerted to this
type of attack, ICS owners and operators may have adequate controls to protect their
assets. However, a determined, knowledgeable adversary such as Vitek Boden could
potentially defeat these controls.
