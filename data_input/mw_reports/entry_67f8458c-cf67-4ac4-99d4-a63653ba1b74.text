October 19, 2021

Cybersecurity Awareness Month may be in full swing, but that doesn’t mean that
cybercriminals have been taking a break. In fact, the opposite is true – October has seen
threats like ZLoader and HoneyGain have continued to evolve. Meanwhile, STRRAT has
wreaked havoc by enabling bad actors to steal credentials and install additional malware.
In today’s Threat Spotlight blog, we break these threats down for you and walk through
which Cisco Secure products can help protect your network. If you want to learn more about
these threats, register for our on-demand webinar today!

Threat Name: STRRAT
Threat Type: RAT
Delivery and Exfiltration:

1/10

STRRAT Attack Chain
Description: STRRAT is a Java-based Remote Access Tool (RAT) that does not require a
pre-installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It is mainly distributed through malicious
spam (malspam) campaigns. The malware installs RDPWrap, steals credentials, logs
keystrokes, and remotely controls Windows systems. It also contains a ransomware module.
STRRAT Spotlight: STRRAT campaigns utilize malspam as a means of initial access. If a
victim opens a weaponized email attachment and enables macros within the document on a
vulnerable Windows host, the macro code downloads a zip archive containing a JRE, an
encrypted and obfuscated .jar file, and a script to run STRRAT using the JRE from the zip
archive. The RAT focuses on stealing passwords via keylogging, as well as stored web
browser and email client credentials. It supports the following browsers and email clients:
Firefox
Internet Explorer
Chrome
Foxmail
Outlook
Thunderbird
STRRAT also installs RDPWrap, an open source tool that enables Remote Desktop support
on Windows. What’s more, STRRAT contains a ransomware module. Features and
commands it supports are similar to other RATs, including the ability to download and
execute additional malware.

Threat Name: ZLoader (Terdot or Zbot)
Threat Type: Loader
Delivery and Exfiltration: The ZLoader attack utilizes three methods of infection.

ZLoader Attack Chain no. 1

ZLoader Attack Chain no. 2

4/10

ZLoader Attack Chain no. 3
Description: ZLoader (also known as Terdot and Zbot) is a banking trojan that was first
observed in 2016. It is still under active development and many versions have appeared
since December 2019. It acts as a backdoor to infected systems and has the ability to
download additional malware. It also implements web injection to steal cookies, passwords,
and sensitive information. ZLoader targets users of financial institutions and has been used
to deliver ransomware from Egregor and Ryuk families.
ZLoader Spotlight: Recent Zloader campaigns used multiple initial attack vectors. Among
these are the Malsmoke malvertising campaign, phishing campaigns with malspam, and a
malvertising campaign abusing advertisements published through Google Adwords. A recent
evolution of the infection chain includes dynamic agent creation to download malicious
payloads from a remote server. The malware can disable Windows Defender and relies on
system binaries and scripts (living-off-the-land, or LOLBAS) in order to evade detection.
ZLoader leverages process injection to contact its command and control server using a
Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). Once it identifies a responding domain, optional
modules and a possible update to ZLoader is downloaded.

Threat Name: HoneyGain
Threat Type: Potentially Unwanted Application
Delivery and Exfiltration:

7/10

HoneyGain Attack Chain
Description: HoneyGain is a is legitimate software that can be used to proxy clients’
connections for money. However, due to increased popularity, malicious actors started to
distribute Trojanized versions of this software bundled with malicious payload. This packed
malware contains a complete set of monetization methods, including a Trojanized version of

8/10

the HoneyGain proxyware client, an XMRig miner, and an information stealer. The campaign
continues to evolve, with the recent deployment of Nanowire client, another proxyware
application with similar functionality.
HoneyGain Spotlight: A variety of different malware families are being distributed under the
guise of legitimate installers for applications like HoneyGain. These trojanized installers
enable adversaries to distribute threats such as RATs, information stealers, and other
malware to victims who believe they are installing legitimate applications. Associated
malware was also observed leveraging victims’ CPU resources to mine cryptocurrency, while
also monetizing their network bandwidth using proxyware applications. One of the most
common techniques observed is the use of legitimate installers as decoy programs included
alongside other malicious components. In these attacks, threat actors are distributing
malicious executables posing as installers for legitimate proxyware applications like
HoneyGain. When executed, they will typically install the legitimate application while silently
installing malware.
