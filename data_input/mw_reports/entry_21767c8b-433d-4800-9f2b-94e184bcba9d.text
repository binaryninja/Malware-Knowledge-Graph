Several US government agencies shared a warning on 22 September 2020 with respect to
foreign entities using disinformation to sow confusion and discord around the US 2020
election. While evaluating this alert, Thomas Rid highlighted two key passages:

and:

1/4

The central thesis of the document and the two highlighted passages above is that
underlying election integrity may be unaltered and safe, but communications about such
activity may be modified, obscured, or perverted for malicious purposes. As argued earlier
here, many types of critical infrastructure attacks need not produce a substantial disruptive
event – they only need to create a perception of unreliability or frailty to achieve significant
impacts. As outlined above, the US government is clearly adopting this perspective and
incorporating it into their risk framework for likely impacts to the 2020 elections.
Under this scenario, a likely attack could take the following route:
1. Anticipate a highly-contested, close election (which is almost certainly likely in the US).
2. Disrupt or interdict legitimate media communication surrounding election results as
they are reported.
3. Leverage this disruption to push a variety of false or misleading narratives to sow doubt
and confusion.
4. Once “regular” avenues of reporting are restored, sufficient doubt exists that election
results are called into question by a noticeable portion of the population.
This may seem far-fetched, but as Mr. Rid pointed out in his book Active Measures, such a
scenario has in fact already manifested – in Ukraine’s 2014 Presidential elections. In this
scenario, election authorities were repeatedly disrupted, with attackers ultimately interdicting
official election result announcements – which were subsequently amplified by Russian state
media.
In this specific case, Ukrainain defenders (as they have proven multiple times over the past
decade) were up to the task in defending networks and rapidly restoring operations. But the
direction of this attack – disrupting not only election operations, but election communications
– highlighted fault lines that exist not only in Ukraine but in every modern democracy.
Essentially, disrupting the actual machinery of modern elections – with its various systems,
physical safeguards, and other checks – is quite hard. This is especially the case for a
country as large and diverse as the United States, where there are essentially 50 separate
authorities running national elections.
Instead of trying to either take the difficult route of modifying results or impacting individual
precincts and districts piecemeal, a shortcut exists which CyberBerkut realized in 2014:
target the transmission of results, rather than the results themselves. In hotly contested

elections – such as Ukraine’s 2014 election or the US’s 2020 Presidential election –
audiences will eagerly demand results on election night, logistics and practicalities be
damned.
In the case of federal entities such as the US, the combination of distributed election
authorities, tightly contested races, and the contingencies put into place due to COVID-19, a
very unique situation emerges. The following criteria likely hold for US elections in 2020:
Ballots will be cast in a variety of formats depending on jurisdiction due to the impact of
COVID-19, almost certainly resulting in a substantial increase in mail-in and absentee
ballots.
Current law in nearly all jurisdictions prohibits counting mail-in and similar ballots
before the actual federal election day.
Assuming the contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden (along with multiple
legislative and other positions) is close, delayed ballot counting will play a substantial
role in deciding the outcome of elections.
A populace generally attuned to knowing election results at the close of election day
will be uniquely susceptible to messaging around results (or manipulations thereof)
given delays and other artifacts surrounding current circumstances.
Based on these observations, the 2020 US election is an ideal opportunity for malicious
actors to attempt various strategies to sow discord and dissent – not through modification or
manipulation of any election results, but rather through disinformation and messaging
modification.
While such activity may not manifest itself as bluntly as CyberBerkut’s operations in Ukraine
in 2014, the rough playbook from that event still holds. Only in this case, the electoral system
in the US is already disrupted by events and the doubts generated by authorities (no less
than the President himself) and various media outlets. So all an attacker need do in this
situation is ensure a false or misleading narrative is published and disseminated widely in
conjunction with “legitimate” results to sow significant discord and discontent in the US
process. Given the already fraught nature of the current US election cycle, a mere “nudge”
towards chaos may produce outsized results.
The most alarming aspect of the above scenario is that there is almost nothing that can be
done to counteract it at this time. The surest means to combat disinformation – an educated,
questioning, and alert public – is something almost beyond recognition given that the US
populace is still unsure whether or not wearing masks might be a worthwhile consideration to
slow the spread of COVID-19. When such relatively basic items meet such resistance, trying
to convince individuals or groups that the narrative most sympathetic to their existing
worldview may be false seems a daunting if not outright impossible task.

Ultimately, malicious entities need not compromise voter databases or election systems to
sway or disrupt the US political process. A sustained, coordinated media campaign usurping
already-degraded mainstream channels could very well succeed in pushing narratives that a
vocal minority of the US population will embrace, leading to significant post-election chaos.
And given the state of matters within the US and its extreme polarization, there is probably
almost nothing that can be done to mitigate against this threat short of shutting down the
internet and muzzling the press.
Given the above, I am deeply concerned and honestly quite afraid of what November 2020
will bring as of this writing. The preconditions for slight “nudging” existing prejudices to
foment outright chaos or conflict already exist. Adversaries are not stupid, and have realized
this. The open question at this time is not whether such adversaries will try to sow chaos in
the US this year, but rather whether they understand US culture and divisions well enough to
succeed in doing so.
