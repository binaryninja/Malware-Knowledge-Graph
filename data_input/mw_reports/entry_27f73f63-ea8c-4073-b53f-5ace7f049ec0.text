The Threat Landscape in Brief

In 2021, the fast-tracked digital transformations that enabled the continuity of many organizations also
opened them up to a slew of threats both old and new, as cybercriminals proved savvy to opportunities
for abuse and attack, including those that had emerged since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Modern ransomware actors grew more ambitious and deliberate with their attacks, and set their sights
on more profitable targets. Going beyond indiscriminately going after their victims, operators running
ransomware families like REvil1 and Conti2 eschewed automated attacks in favor of a more hands-on,
long-haul approach to carefully tailor their campaigns to entities in critical industries.
Targeted attacks gained popularity among different kinds of malicious actors, including those in
cyberespionage and cybermercenary groups, who were armed with upgraded toolboxes that made
their operations even more effective. Attacks from the likes of Void Balaur3 and Tropic Trooper4
demonstrated how these groups were capable of developing customized tools and were adept at red
teamwork. Phishing scams remained a staple in these cyberattacks, in part because the influx of news
about the global pandemic gave malicious actors ideas for new lures that resonated with a wider pool
of potential victims.
Any cracks in an organization’s security posture could be devastating for business continuity, as could
be seen from the rise in and impact of critical vulnerabilities in 2021. The growth of the underground
exploit market proved that, left unpatched, older flaws could still inflict as much damage on infected
systems as newly discovered ones. Malicious actors continued to employ flaws both old and new in
their campaigns, as in the Squirrelwaffle loader’s use of the ProxyLogon and ProxyShell vulnerabilities,5
and the Khonsari ransomware attacks that incorporated the Log4Shell vulnerability.6
Pressing security issues also continued to plague organizations-turned-cloud-adopters. Most of the
challenges in cloud security in 2021 could be attributed to misconfigurations in the setup of cloud
environments, as evidenced by how TeamTNT abused incorrectly configured servers to compromise
Docker Hub accounts. TeamTNT was one of the first cybercriminal groups to focus primarily on cloud
service providers (CSPs), signaling a growing interest in the cloud within cybercriminal circles.
From large-scale ransomware campaigns to high-risk vulnerabilities, the far-reaching impact of these
security incidents showed that no user, enterprise, or industry was immune to compromise. The
massive disruptions caused by high-profile attacks underscored the need for visibility over the everevolving attack surface across an organization’s entire digital infrastructure. The defenses that might
have sufficed in a prepandemic world stood to be reevaluated, if not redefined, in the face of mounting
risks that could be averted only by an adaptive threat monitoring, detection, and response strategy
with which organizations could continuously assess and enhance their security postures.
This annual cybersecurity report explores the notable events and emerging trends that shaped the
cybersecurity landscape of 2021, during which Trend Micro protected its customers from over 94
billion threats. We hope that this roundup can provide organizations and end users alike with valuable
insights they can use to make informed decisions about their security infrastructure and policies as
they navigate and move forward in an ever-changing threat landscape.

Modern Ransomware Actors
Continue to Target
Critical Industries
Over the years, we have observed how ransomware has evolved significantly. In 2018, a spray-and-pray
strategy was the norm among malicious actors, who wanted to profit from as many victims as possible.7
However, our researchers foresaw how ransomware operators would pivot away from such a quantitybased tactic and become more deliberate in their movements.8 Notably, in 2021 ransomware operators
staged attacks on more profitable targets, leading to business disruptions with real-world ramifications
felt on a global scale.9
Already strained by the pandemic, healthcare organizations were hit hard by ransomware attacks in 2021,
which were just behind the banking and government industries in terms of ransomware detections. A
2021 report suggests that because healthcare organizations are less likely to back up their data than
those in other industries, they are more prone to paying the demands of ransomware actors.10 Moreover,
the healthcare industry has a trove of data that attackers seek to sell or use for extortion, including patient
records with social security numbers, medical histories, and financial information.11

Attempted WannaCry infections topped the list of ransomware detections across all three of the most
affected industries, outpacing other ransomware families by a wide margin. The spray-and-pray approach
used by legacy ransomware like WannaCry might account for its large volume of attacks, but notably,
modern ransomware gained ground.

Unlike their premodern counterparts, modern ransomware groups displayed erratic activity as they closed
in on specific targets rather than cast a wide net,12 which is most likely why we observed a 21% decrease
in overall ransomware detections in 2021. We observed several modern ransomware groups ramp up their
activities last year: Year-on-year detections of REvil (also known as Sodinokibi) soared by 143%, there
were over 20 times as many detections of LockBit in 2021 as there were in 2020, and detections of Conti
rose more than ninefold from the previous year.

Another factor that might have played into the decline in ransomware detections was the marked increase
in our detections and blocking of malware tools like the Cobalt Strike beacon CoBeacon, the trojan
Trickbot, and the information stealer BazarLoader. Our blocking of larger numbers of these affiliate tools
might have prevented ransomware operators from staging full-blown attacks in 2021, as the presence of
such tools is an early indicator of infection. In 2021, there was an eightfold rise in detections of CoBeacon,
which had been abused by operators of ransomware families such as DoppelPaymer, Povlsomware, and
Ryuk.13 Detections of Trickbot, which had been linked to the Conti ransomware14 as well as Ryuk,15 saw
a 23% year-on-year increase. Most notably, detections in 2021 of BazarLoader, which had been used to
gain initial access to systems by the likes of Conti16 and Ryuk,17 were up by 2,468% from the previous year.
Because modern ransomware has more human involvement, collaboration among cybercriminals has
gained traction in the underground, as evidenced by the rising trend of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS).
RaaS affiliate programs have been beneficial for all cybercriminal parties involved: By bringing partners
onboard to divide the labor, ransomware actors can more efficiently profit from a victim’s compromised
assets.18 The proliferation of RaaS has not only made ransomware more accessible even to malicious
actors with limited technical knowledge but also given rise to higher specialization within the cybercrime
ecosystem. In splitting the work among themselves, RaaS affiliates have been able to hone their skills and
focus on certain specialties like penetrating networks or running the malware.19
The widespread use of RaaS is a result of the ongoing evolution of the flourishing cybercrime-as-a-service
market, which continues to develop new business models for attackers. One such development is the
growing demand for access-as-a-service (AaaS), with access brokers peddling stolen credentials in the
criminal underground and finding reliable customers in ransomware actors, who use their wares to infect
target systems.20
Another trend that has caught on within cybercriminal circles is the incorporation of double extortion, in
which ransomware actors not only demand a sum to restore access to a victim’s encrypted files but also
threaten to release the sensitive data upon failure of payment. This tactic was first perpetrated in 2019 by
the Maze ransomware and has since become even more widely used. As of June 2021, as many as 35
ransomware families employed double extortion. Some, including REvil and Conti, augmented their RaaS
operations with this extortion technique to pursue big-name targets.21
Since it was discovered by Cisco Talos in 2019, REvil has become one of the most active RaaS families.22
In 2021, it continued its use of double extortion on multinational enterprises like Apple,23 JBS,24 and
Kaseya25 to great effect. The bulk of REvil attacks took place in the US, but countries like Mexico and
Germany were also affected.

6 | Navigating New Frontiers: Trend Micro 2021 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Based on our telemetry, REvil attacks were aimed at critical industries. Most were levied against the
transportation industry, followed by organizations in the financial and the oil and gas industries. In our
report on ransomware activity during the first half of 2021, we posited that the transportation industry
bore the brunt of REvil attacks likely because it played an important part in global supply chains and
logistics.26
REvil’s customized attacks suggest that its operators have extensive knowledge of their targets’ IT
environments. The efficiency of REvil can also be attributed to its diverse toolbox. This includes the use
of Qakbot, AdFind, BloodHound, and other third-party sync tools, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities
like CVE-2021-30116, which affects Kaseya VSA servers; CVE-2019-2725, a deserialization vulnerability
in Oracle WebLogic; the FortiGate SSL VPN flaw CVE-2018-13379; and the Pulse Secure SSL VPN
vulnerability CVE-2019-11510.27

Another notorious RaaS, called Conti, which we believe to be a successor of Ryuk, was behind many
debilitating attacks around the world in 2021.28 In the US alone, there were more than a million Conti
attacks between January 1 and November 12, 2021.29 As noted in our 2021 midyear cybersecurity report,
this modern ransomware family had the tenth highest number of attack attempts during the first half of
2021.30 The bulk of these occurred in the US, followed by the Netherlands and Taiwan. Retail organizations
experienced the most Conti attacks. The insurance, manufacturing, and telecommunications industries
were also hit hard, but Conti’s high-profile attacks on healthcare organizations was what made major
headlines last year.31

7 | Navigating New Frontiers: Trend Micro 2021 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Like REvil’s, Conti’s operators also take advantage of double extortion, threatening to release stolen
data and selling access to infected systems if their victims fail to pay the ransom. They employ a variety
of exploits, such as those of the PrintNightmare and Zerologon vulnerabilities, and tools and malware,
including familiar names like BazarLoader, Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, and Rclone. Working in concert,
these enable Conti operators to gain remote access to a targeted system, disable the system’s security
software, locate and exfiltrate valuable data, and encrypt files to make them inaccessible until the ransom
demand is met.

Cloud Adopters and Remote
Workers Contend With Rising
Threats to Cloud Environments
Threats to cloud security were among the most pressing IT infrastructure risks for organizations in 2021,
according to the Cyber Risk Index for the first half of 2021.32 Protecting their cloud architecture is a challenge
for companies because many of the technologies that compose this architecture are regularly updated
with new features.33 On top of these complexities, defenders must keep up with the tools malicious actors
use to target the cloud, which are also constantly changing. For instance, in 2019, steganography, or the
practice of hiding code within an image, was a trend in cloud attacks.34 The following year, malicious
actors used valid and clean images that downloaded malware onto affected systems after deployment.
And as detailed in our midyear cybersecurity report, in 2021 attackers reverted to using images with
malicious content.35

Malicious Actors Continue to Take
Advantage of Cloud Misconfigurations
The cloud has helped many organizations accelerate their digital transformations and embrace remote work
during the Covid-19 pandemic. Spending on cloud infrastructure, including cloud computing and storage
solutions, saw a 6.6% year-on-year increase in the third quarter of 2021, which amounted to US$18.6
billion, and 2021 saw an overall growth in cloud-related expenditure, according to the International Data
Corporation.36
However, malicious actors were quick to capitalize on this push toward digitization, as securing the cloud
comes with its share of complexities. Cloud environments continued to be at risk of compromise at the
hands of cybercriminals who were out to abuse any misconfigurations, which proved to be major weak
spots of cloud security even though CSPs had endeavored to make cloud services safer by recommending
that all customers follow the shared responsibility model.37
Fortifying the security postures of cloud environments that use services like those of Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) — the three biggest CSPs in the world38 —
should be a top priority for cloud adopters, for whom misconfigurations might not only lead to costly data
breaches but also run up expenses from idle instances and unused storage.39 According to 2021 data
9 | Navigating New Frontiers: Trend Micro 2021 Annual Cybersecurity Report

from Trend Micro Cloud One™ – Conformity, Amazon Elastic Block Store, a block storage service, had
the highest number of configuration failures among AWS services, with a misconfiguration rate of 29%.
Virtual Machines had the most misconfigurations among Azure services, with a 65% misconfiguration
rate, while Identity and Access Management (IAM) pulled in the most misconfigurations among GCP
services, with a 98% misconfiguration rate.

One misconfiguration that was frequently abused by malicious actors in 2021 was found in the REST
APIs of Docker, a software platform used to build, test, and deploy software applications. Incorrectly
configured servers with exposed Docker REST APIs became a prime target for the cybercriminal group
TeamTNT, which abused the Docker REST APIs by using compromised Docker Hub accounts to deploy
malware like cryptocurrency miners.40
The growing adoption of cloud-based software and services has put the cloud in the crosshairs of malicious
actor groups like TeamTNT, which was among the first groups to target CSPs in their campaigns, primarily
to steal CSPs’ environmental metadata. Upon analyzing their recent campaigns, we found that the group
had augmented its repertoire of tools, which enabled it to launch more modular attacks on specific
victims. 41

This group was also the perpetrator behind a cryptocurrency-mining and credential theft campaign
that targeted Kubernetes, a widely used container management platform, from March to May 2021.
By exploiting a role-based access control misconfiguration as an entry point for its attacks, TeamTNT
was able to take over multiple Kubernetes clusters. This resulted in the compromise of nearly 50,000 IP
addresses, most of which were in China and the US.42

Email Threats Climb as More
Organizations Adopt Remote Work
Since the onset of the pandemic, internet and email usage had been even more instrumental for business
continuity and remote work. As email became an even more useful tool for people around the world who
were working from home, malicious actors seized the opportunity to take advantage of remote workers’
increased dependence on online communication. In 2021, Trend Micro Cloud App Security, an API-based
solution that protects both users and organizations from threats to their cloud-based apps and services,
detected and blocked more than 25.7 million email threats, a marked increase from the over 16.7 million
threats that the solution detected and blocked the previous year.
11 | Navigating New Frontiers: Trend Micro 2021 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Email remained an oft-used avenue for cybercriminals to stage their attacks. In fact, 92% of malware
was delivered through email in 2021.43 Phishing emails in particular were responsible for 90% of 2021’s
data breaches.44 Phishing campaigns persisted as an effective means to spread malware, especially
ransomware, in 2021, as proved by the enduring success of Emotet, the notorious botnet-malwareturned-RaaS. Authorities took down Emotet in November 2021, but its absence was short-lived, as it
resurfaced toward the end of the year.45 Its yearslong use by ransomware groups like Ryuk and trojans like
Trickbot showed how much the underground economy had grown and continued to evolve, to the point
that it eventually developed its own supply chain.46
Phishing attempts that were detected and blocked by Trend Micro Cloud App Security in 2021 nearly
doubled from those in 2020. Of these, 62% were from spam emails, which increased nearly sevenfold
from the previous year. The remaining 38% were credential-phishing attempts, which grew by 14% from
2020. (Credential phishing involves cybercriminals’ use of fake login pages to gull potential victims into
handing over their account credentials, whereas phishing by spam email is a broader category that aims
to get user information.) The finance industry experienced the most phishing attempts, followed closely
by the healthcare and education industries.

Despite a slight increase during the first half of the year, possibly as a result of more attacks on businesses
and supply chains related to vaccine production,47 detections of attempts at business email compromise
(BEC) totaled 282,775 in 2021, dropping 11% from the previous year’s BEC detections.
Malicious actors turned to increasingly sophisticated BEC attempts, focusing on improving the quality
of their email content rather than on churning out a high volume of attack attempts. Though there were
fewer BEC attempt detections in 2021, Trend Micro Cloud App Security found and blocked 133,541 BEC
emails using authorship analysis, while the remaining 149,234 were detected using behavior and intention
analysis. The former, which could be detected only by comparing the spoofing email with the writing
style of the supposed sender, made up 47% of all BEC attempts in 2021, whereas the 73,210 that were
detected in 2020 composed only 23% of all BEC attempts found that year.

The greatest numbers of BEC attempts were aimed at the retail and consulting industries. The retail
industry remained an appealing target for financially motivated cybercriminals, especially phishing
fraudsters, owing to the wealth of customer payment data, credentials, and other personal information
that retailers held.48

In 2021, the information and communication industry was the most common target of malware-laden
emails. While many businesses struggled during the pandemic, this industry continued to grow and is
expected to be valued at over US$11.9 trillion by 2025, which might explain why it had been in the
crosshairs of attackers.49 Retail companies were also on the receiving end of many emails with malware.
Retailers drew the attention of more attackers after the industry experienced rapid growth when online
sales surged as a result of the pandemic.50 Malicious email attachments were also a common means for
cybercriminals to carry out attacks on construction firms, which were appealing targets because of their
valuable intellectual properties, such as blueprints, that could be used to bypass buildings’ security.51

Targeted Attacks Take Aim at
Bigger Game With
Upgraded Arsenal
With more malicious actors moving past the indiscriminate distribution of their malware, 2021 saw certain
industries fall prey to targeted attacks. An enduring threat that has plagued organizations as far back as
2012,52 targeted attacks require a high level of technical expertise and a plethora of resources on the part
of threat actors, because the tools and techniques involved need to be tailored to the intended victims’
systems.53
During the first half of 2021, we observed a shift to more targeted modern ransomware that veered
away from quantity-based attacks and toward more profitable prey,54 as more cybercriminals resorted to
increasingly advanced tools and techniques that pointed to a targeted approach. Not only can this kind
of attack have a direct impact on the targeted organization, but its effects can also be felt by the victim’s
customers because of any resulting business disruption or customer information leakage.55 The threat
actors behind a targeted attack may be financially motivated, but its main goal is data theft.56

Void Balaur Stages Attacks on
Government Entities and Other Targets
Also known as Rockethack, Void Balaur is a cybermercenary group that deals largely in data theft and
cyberespionage, advertising its services in the Russian-speaking cybercriminal underground through
forums and websites like Darkmoney and Probiv. In past years, we observed this group launch attacks on
the telecommunications, retail, financial, medical, and biotechnology industries. They continued pursuing
telecommunications organizations in 2021, when we discovered that Void Balaur had been targeting
engineers and management officers of various Russian and UK telecommunications outfits.57

16 | Navigating New Frontiers: Trend Micro 2021 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Although the hackers-for-hire behind the group are driven by monetary gain, they have also frequently
targeted journalists, human rights activists, and government officials. For instance, in September 2021,
we found Void Balaur targeting a former head of an intelligence agency, two members of the national
parliament, and five active government ministers of an Eastern European country. This suggests that
their activities might play into a larger campaign on multiple fronts to cause widespread disruption. Many
of their targets are based in Russia and its neighboring countries, although Void Balaur activity has also
been spotted in other European countries, the US, Japan, and Israel.
Among Void Balaur’s main services is hacking into email and social media accounts. For a higher fee, the
group can also supply the complete copies of stolen email inboxes without the users’ knowledge. In 2019,
it began selling the confidential information of Russian individuals, such as their criminal records, credit
histories, bank statements, text messages, and passport and flight data. Void Balaur uses specialized
malware like Z*Stealer and DroidWatcher, capable of remote tracking, accessing location information,
and stealing user credentials for different apps and digital currency wallets.58

Tropic Trooper Returns to Attack
the Transportation and
Government Industries
The cyberespionage group Tropic Trooper, which now goes by Earth Centaur, has been active since
2011 but it resurfaced in July 2020 with new tools, including modified remote access trojans (RATs).
Toward the end of 2020 and continuing in 2021, we observed it using these tools to target transportation
businesses and transport-related government organizations.59 Its attacks commonly involve information
theft — including that of financial documents, search histories, and flight schedules — from compromised
systems. Based on our analysis, we predict that Tropic Trooper will continue gathering confidential data
while waiting for the opportune time to capitalize on it.
Tropic Trooper usually breaches its victims’ systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in their Microsoft Internet
Information Services and Exchange servers, and then installing web shells that execute backdoors
such as ChiserClient and SmileSvr. The group uses a customized variant of Gh0st RAT to discover and
collect information from active sessions on an infected host, which it then exfiltrates using the victim’s
compromised intranet.
The threat actors behind Tropic Trooper have proved themselves talented at red teamwork. By using
open-source frameworks, they have developed various backdoors with different protocols, which they
have used to bypass their victims’ security settings. They also employ reverse proxies to avoid detection
by network security systems.

More Malicious Actors Use BazarLoader
as an Arrival Mechanism
During the third quarter of 2021, we observed an uptick in the use of BazarLoader, an information stealer
and loader that we detected as TrojanSpy.Win64.BAZARLOADER and Backdoor.Win64.BAZARLOADER.
The highest detections of BazarLoader took place in the Americas region.60
Since it was first observed in 2020,61 BazarLoader has been used by cybercriminals to gain initial access
for data theft or to deploy second-stage malware like ransomware. Between January and October 2021,
BazarLoader campaigns that used malicious spam emails as an arrival mechanism primarily targeted the
US, followed by select European and Asian countries. Most of these emails took the form of fraudulent
order invoices and notices of service plan termination. On the other hand, campaigns that used JavaScript
droppers to deliver BazarLoader over the same period focused on targets in the US and Australia.
Notably, malicious actors use different arrival mechanisms to deliver BazarLoader as part of their attacks.
In one method, BazarLoader is bundled with a legitimate program and deployed using a software installer,
such as that for VLC and TeamViewer. Its delivery mechanism possibly involves social engineering as
a means of tricking victims into downloading the compromised installer. A BazarLoader executable is
then dropped while the installer is loading. The installer creates a process that runs the BazarLoader
executable and then establishes a connection with a command-and-control (C&C) server using Microsoft
Edge.
Other malicious actors favor a method that involves delivery by way of an ISO file that contains a Windows
LNK (link) file. The LNK file is disguised as a folder icon to trick a victim into clicking it, which runs its
BazarLoader dynamic-link library (DLL) payload.

Qakbot Reemerges With
an Improved Variant
Discovered in 2007,62 the information stealer Qakbot, which is detected by Trend Micro as
TrojanSpy.Win32.QAKBOT, has become popular among ransomware operators as a piece of malwareinstallation-as-a-service botnet malware for their campaigns. In 2019, Qakbot infections were used in the
deployment of manually operated ransomware families like MegaCortex, PwndLocker, Egregor, ProLock,
and, most recently, REvil/Sodinokibi.63
Following a three-month hiatus, Qakbot operators resumed their email spam run in September 2021.
Their campaign returned with a new version of Qakbot that uses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
macros as well as Excel 4.0 macros. Over the past years, we observed that spam campaigns linked to
Qakbot operators mainly targeted the telecommunications, technology, and education industries. Among
the top countries affected by these campaigns were the US, Japan, and Germany.

Buer Loader Becomes Better at
Evading Detection
Buer Loader’s competitive pricing made it the malware loader of choice for many threat actors when it
was introduced in the underground market in 2019. It remains active to this day and has been used by
threat actors to deploy well-known malware such as Ryuk, Wizard Spider, and the Cobalt Strike beacon
as part of targeted ransomware attacks.64 We found that Buer Loader was most active in India, followed
by Israel, and that detections of the loader were highest among organizations in the healthcare, banking,
and telecommunications industries.
In 2021, a new variant of Buer Loader, written in Rust, was used in spam runs that involved emails
with malicious attachments containing the loader. One campaign used emails that masqueraded as DHL
shipping notices, while succeeding campaigns mentioned Covid-19 in their emails as a lure or referenced
both DHL and Covid-19. The Buer Loader variant used in these emails retains most of the same code as
in previous variants, but it was likely rewritten in a new programming language to avoid detection. This
updated variant also uses signed XLL (Excel add-in) files as another way to stay under the radar of their
victims’ IT teams.

Water Basilisk Uses New Crypter Tool to
Flood Systems With RATs
August 2021 saw the height of activity for a fileless attack campaign called Water Basilisk, which bombards
its victims’ systems with RATs — including BitRat, NjRat, LimeRat, Warzone, QuasarRat, and Nanocore
RAT — through a new HCrypt variant.65 The operators behind Water Basilisk use this crypter-as-a-service
to make obfuscated VBScript and PowerShell scripts that deploy their malicious payloads. We have
observed Water Basilisk incidents that involve PowerShell scripts containing as many as seven RATs.66
Water Basilisk actors have been hosting their malware and phishing kits on publicly accessible file-hosting
services and compromised WordPress websites. They use these WordPress websites or phishing emails
to disseminate a malicious ISO image. This image has an obfuscated VBScript stager that downloads and
executes next-stage VBScript content into an infected system. Finally, PowerShell scripts deobfuscate
and deploy their payload RATs in a given process.
The HCrypt version that Water Basilisk uses to propagate its malware is sold in underground markets for
US$199. Our analysis suggests that more variants of this crypter tool, which continues to be updated
by its developers, will be introduced in the future, and these can contain even more RATs and have an
updated obfuscation algorithm to evade detection more effectively.

Rising Vulnerabilities Leave
Unpatched Systems Exposed to
More Risks
The intricacies of modern IT infrastructures make patch management essential for business operations to
run smoothly, but this is easier said than done: On average, it takes 200 days to fix a vulnerability, and 256
days if the flaw is rated severe.67 In an ideal world, organizations routinely update the software they rely on
and their own security policies. But this is a tall order for IT teams that are already spread thin, especially
because tracking updates is but one of their many everyday tasks.68

Older Flaws Stay Relevant as
Malicious Actors Bank on
Unprotected IT Environments
In 2021, Trend Micro™ Zero Day Initiative™ (ZDI), a part of Trend Micro Research, released advisories
on 1,604 vulnerabilities, which was 10% higher than the corresponding number from the previous year.
Among these, 54 were rated with critical severity, a significant decrease from the 173 critical vulnerabilities
of 2020. However, 2021 did see an increase in those rated with high severity, rising to 1,138 from the
previous year’s 983.

Many legacy vulnerabilities have stayed in use, as there remains a demand for them in the underground
exploit market. In fact, our 2021 study found that 22% of the exploits sold in the underground were over
three years old.69 Such exploits have been a reliable source of income for malicious actors, who can sell
them in underground forums, with prices starting at US$1,000.70
Data from Trend Micro™ TippingPoint® Threat Protection System, a network security platform deployed
at some of the largest organizations in the world, shows that malicious actors also exploited relatively
new vulnerabilities alongside older ones, with some dating as far back as 2005, despite the availability
of patches for these flaws. There are familiar names in the list of vulnerabilities with the highest exploit
counts in 2021; seven of these have been extensively abused by cybercriminals and have ranked among
the most exploited flaws since 2017.
Far and away the highest number of exploit detections in 2021 was of CVE-2019-1225, which amounted
to over 75 million found by Trend Micro. CVE-2019-1225 is a memory disclosure flaw in Microsoft’s
Remote Desktop Services that was disclosed in August 2019.71 Successful exploits of this vulnerability
allow attackers to gather information that they can use to further compromise victims’ systems. Coming
in second was the critical vulnerability CVE-2017-14100. Found in Asterisk, a software implementation
of a private branch exchange from Digium, this flaw accounted for more than 20 million detections in
2021. Exploits of this flaw, which was disclosed in September 2017, allow unauthorized users to remotely
perform arbitrary shell command injections.72

Log4j Flaw Log4Shell Leads to
Exploit Outbreak
2021 was peppered with noteworthy incidents that resulted from unpatched security gaps, such as the
high-severity vulnerability CVE-2021-44228. First reported privately to Apache in November 202173 and
dubbed Log4Shell, this flaw affects Apache Log4j, a Java-based logging tool.74 Although the opensource Apache community had released a patch for it in December, the vulnerability still led to a slew
of exploits that malicious actors developed for a variety of illicit activities, including data theft, malware
deployment, and unauthorized cryptocurrency mining or cryptojacking. Notably, the operators of the
Khonsari ransomware began using Log4Shell in their attacks in December 2021.75
Log4j is a widely used utility in both in-house and third-party applications for enterprises. Log4j’s
dependence on Java makes it difficult to detect when the tool is running across an enterprise’s
environments. This explains why Log4Shell is not easily addressed, despite the availability of a patch.
Log4Shell could allow attackers to send crafted log messages that execute arbitrary code, effectively
weaponizing compromised machines to launch different kinds of attacks.
22 | Navigating New Frontiers: Trend Micro 2021 Annual Cybersecurity Report

As of December 2021, Log4Shell affected only 7% of Trend Micro customers, scattered across the
Americas, the AMEA (Asia, Middle East, and Africa) region, Europe, and Japan, with the US having
experienced the highest number of incidents.76 Among our customers, the organizations most affected by
this vulnerability belonged to the government, retail, and manufacturing industries.

Attackers Exploit ProxyLogon and
ProxyShell Flaws
Other prominent flaws that made waves in 2021 included the ProxyLogon and ProxyShell vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Exchange Server, which were disclosed in late 2020. Microsoft released patches for ProxyLogon
(CVE-2021-26855) in March 2021 and for the ProxyShell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473 and CVE-202134523) in May and July 2021.77 Despite the availability of patches, however, our telemetry showed that
ProxyLogon had been part of many 2021 attacks by different malware families, such as the LemonDuck
cryptocurrency miner, the BlackKingdom ransomware, and the Prometei botnet malware.78
In September 2021, researchers reported on spam campaigns employing a new loader called
Squirrelwaffle.79 We found that these campaigns also used ProxyLogon and ProxyShell exploits in their
spam campaigns, and in doing so, they were able to send malicious emails posing as replies in existing
email threads to trick potential victims.80 In November 2021, our investigation into Squirrelwaffle intrusions
in the Middle East showed that publicly available ProxyLogon exploits were used to gain access to, search
through, and even download a victim’s email messages. The ProxyShell vulnerabilities were also abused
by Squirrelwaffle’s operators to impersonate a local administrator, enabling them to perform PowerShell
commands and deliver email replies containing a malicious Excel file.81

Unpatched VPN Vulnerabilities Threaten
At-Home Work Setups
The pandemic has bolstered usage of virtual private networks (VPNs) among organizations whose
geographically dispersed employees need to connect to secure corporate networks as part of their workfrom-home setups. For organizations that have embraced remote working, scalable corporate VPNs and
internal applications accessible through their VPNs have become pressing priorities.82 Globally, VPN
usage soared in 2021, during which VPN downloads reached 785 million.83
But like any security technology, VPNs could be abused by malicious actors for their attacks. In 2021,
one of the most exploited vulnerabilities in VPN products was CVE-2018-13379, which accounted for
more than 631,000 detections, even though a patch for it had been available since May 2019.84 This is
a path traversal flaw in Fortinet FortiOS that unauthorized users could abuse to create custom HTTP
resource requests to vulnerable FortiGate SSL VPN endpoints, allowing them to read and download files
from affected systems.85 In early 2021, we discovered the use of CVE-2018-13379 in Sodinokibi86 and
Conti87 ransomware attacks, exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to help attackers get a
foothold in victimized systems. This flaw is among the notable VPN vulnerabilities in 2021, according to
Japan’s Information-Technology Promotion Agency and the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team
Coordination Center.

Pandemic-Related Threats Evolve
and Continue to Plague
Remote Workers
The Covid-19 pandemic has driven organizations to rethink their own operations. In the midst of it, many
have adopted a hybrid work model that is dependent on remote connection and cloud computing to
adapt to and stay afloat through the seismic changes it has precipitated.88 However, research showed that
in 2021, 72% of organizations in the US still struggled to defend themselves against attacks that aimed to
infiltrate their corporate networks through their employees’ work-from-home setups.89
Home offices had expanded the attack surfaces of enterprises, as demonstrated at Pwn2Own Austin
2021, a hacking competition organized by Trend Micro’s ZDI program.90 The event highlighted how the
remote-working staples that many teleworkers relied on could be subjected to attacks. The participating
security researchers carried out collision hacks on devices like printers, routers, and network-attached
storage (NAS) devices by using previously disclosed vulnerabilities or discovering new ones. Collectively,
the participants at Pwn2Own Austin disclosed 61 new bugs.91
Malicious actors have typically used the latest events and news stories in phishing attacks, but these
emails could be used only in the short term. The pandemic, though, has provided them with an abundance
of information around which they could theme their phishing emails. Daily Covid-19 news coverage and
updates have given them a steady supply of guises that have helped them better tailor their techniques
to potential victims.92
Throughout 2021, we observed various scams and malware attacks that used social engineering tactics
to entice potential victims into providing personal information. One trend was the increasing phishing
attacks on the vaccine cold chain, likely because employees involved in any link of the chain had access to
valuable sensitive data. Another was the proliferation of fake mobile apps and websites that impersonated
government entities, nongovernmental organizations, and companies involved in vaccine distribution,
which malicious actors used to target people seeking aid, work opportunities, or more information on
how to acquire vaccines.93
We detected more than 8 million threats related to Covid-19 in 2021, about half as many as those in
the previous year. As in 2020, most of these threats were from the US and Germany, which were likely
targeted because of the important part they played in the cold chain as the base countries of major
vaccine researchers and manufacturers.

Pandemic-related threats in 2021 peaked in May, which was an eventful period for cybercrimes against
the healthcare industry. In that month, Ireland’s public healthcare system, the Health Service Executive,
fell victim to a debilitating Conti attack, resulting in the largest ever known cyberattack on a health service
computer system.94 Additionally, a 2021 report showed that there were two or more data breaches in the
healthcare industry per day for five consecutive months, from March to July, which might account in part
for the substantial surge in Covid-19-related threats in May.95

In 2021, there was a 49% year-on-year decline in Covid-19-related threats, which could be explained
by different factors. Malicious actors might have been lying in wait for new pandemic-related trends and
news that they could abuse. However, these threats were concentrated in two countries, so cybercriminal
interest in Covid-19-themed lures could have been waning elsewhere. While media consumption was
strong in certain countries, especially in Western Europe, the same could not be said of countries whose
media agencies were not as preoccupied with the Covid-19 crisis.96 Additionally, the working hours lost
because of widespread lockdowns were equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs in 2020,97 but that number
receded to 125 million jobs the following year, as more people returned to work after mass vaccination
rollouts and declines in Covid-19 cases.98 As the world gradually adjusted to this new normal and the labor
market made return-to-office plans, Covid-19-themed threats began to lose their efficiency. Heightened
awareness of these threats might have also pushed more enterprises and individual users to employ
software solutions that improved their security postures.
Still, constant vigilance of scams surrounding the pandemic is necessary for all organizations if they
are to steer clear of costly losses. The World Economic Forum reports that since the pandemic began,
cybercrime has evolved in step with the global digital economy: Organizations have had to fend off an
average of 270 attacks each in 2021, and a single successful attack attempt can run up as much as
US$3.6 million in losses.99

29 | Navigating New Frontiers: Trend Micro 2021 Annual Cybersecurity Report

Increasingly Sophisticated Threats
Call for Robust and Multilayered
Defense
2021 was marked by attacks that grew in number and complexity, and whose repertoire of advanced
tools and techniques underscored the necessity of a more strategic, risk-focused approach to security.
Sudden shifts in business operations, like the mass migration to remote work and a growing dependence
on online environments, brought about a shift in the attack surface and a multitude of security gaps that
malicious actors were only too eager to exploit. Companies had grown more reliant on technologies like
the internet of things (IoT) and added more connected devices to their corporate network, which in turn
widened their attack surfaces.100
The changing face of cybercrime means that conventional defense practices are no longer as effective as
they once were. An organization needs to focus on managing risk throughout the life cycle of its attack
surface, with a focus on discovering an ever-changing attack surface, assessing risk, and then mitigating
that risk. This enables the organization to ensure a secure working environment for its physical offices and
be on the lookout for threats that can undermine its virtual workspaces as well. Modern-day distributed
workforces do not access company resources the way they did on-premises, and the security needs of
enterprises across the board have outgrown the password-based authentication processes that were
built on binary login scenarios.101
New security paradigms like zero trust, which assumes that attackers exist both within and outside a
system, are more suited to managing transformed attack surfaces. This is not achieved by any one
product; zero-trust environments are governed by a philosophy of constant validation and monitoring, so
the trustworthiness of every device and user is properly assessed before any device or user is granted
permissions to any company resource. By practicing stringent access management policies that are
grounded in zero trust, organizations can be better equipped to protect themselves against attackers
attempting credential dumping to access their systems or steal their sensitive data.102
Investments in advanced security technologies should not be the sole focus of an organization’s defense
strategy. These also need to be paired with policies that can stand up to increasingly elaborate scams and
lures that elevate overall risk. The social engineering tactics and human errors that have allowed attacks
to make inroads year after year stress the crucial role that individual users play in a company’s security
profile. A workforce that has access to the resources it needs to stay alert and well-informed of potential
threats can help cut off potential entry points for attackers.

Since the pandemic started, the need to secure at-home work setups has also put additional strain on
cybersecurity teams, 61% of which are already understaffed,103 as the shift to hybrid work arrangements
has added to the complexity of enterprise networks and left security personnel scrambling to assist
remote employees. Until this talent gap can be addressed, organizations should work alongside security
vendors to automate processes and provide advanced analytics to lessen the load on their overworked
cybersecurity workforce.104
Companies need security solutions that can assist in the discovery, assessment, and mitigation of
persistent and emerging risks across the enterprise. It is important for enterprises to understand their
growing attack surfaces to determine the security risks of their digital assets if they are to stay agile
and adapt quickly to a changing threat landscape. Discovering the ways in which their attack surfaces
are continuously changing and expanding will help enterprises gain the insights they need to accurately
assess and apply the right security solutions to thwart threats.
However, this is beyond the capability of siloed tools or any single layer of protection. To manage the risk
of evolving threats, decision-makers need to derive insights from high-quality data. As more organizations
undergo digital transformations, they come up against the daunting task of breaking down data silos,
which are usually borne of business units that are accustomed to collecting information separately and of
siloed technology and legacy systems built over time as companies grow.105
Data gathered in silos from different products makes it a challenge for organizations to act on security
incidents swiftly. Without a means to correlate all this information, security leaders are left to piece together
different perspectives of an attack, often with varying levels of detail, from different technologies.106 Having
solutions in place that can assess, cross-check, and consolidate output from systems helps centralize
data and results in a more detailed picture of an organization’s risk posture.
On top of the complex threats bearing down on organizations, they also must keep pace with the rising
number of data privacy and security compliance rules. However, only 4% of a compliance officer’s time
goes toward actually updating policies or implementing new measures to stay abreast of regulatory
developments, whereas 26% of their time on the job is spent liaising with different teams within their
organization.107 A compliance team should be able to access accurate reporting of its company’s
IT infrastructure if it is to be more agile and productive, instead of having to interface with different
departments to manually collect the information it needs.
Organizations can put themselves in a better position to map out their expanding attack surfaces by
employing a unified cybersecurity platform that can monitor and address the different needs of their
endpoint, email, network, and cloud environments simultaneously. In doing so, they can achieve
transparency over the goings-on in their entire digital ecosystems, anticipate new threats, and plan
countermeasures accordingly.
