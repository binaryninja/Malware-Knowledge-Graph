ESET research reveals notorious crime group also conducting espionage campaigns for
the past ﬁve years
Jean-Ian Boutin 11 Jul 2019 - 11:30AM
The Buhtrap group is well known for its targeting of ﬁnancial institutions and businesses
in Russia. However, since late 2015, we have witnessed an interesting change in its
traditional targets. From a pure criminal group perpetrating cybercrime for ﬁnancial gain,
its toolset has been expanded with malware used to conduct espionage in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia.
Throughout our tracking, we’ve seen this group deploy its main backdoor as well as
other tools against various victims, but June 2019 was the ﬁrst time we saw the Buhtrap
group use a zero-day exploit as part of a campaign. In that case, we observed Buhtrap
using a local privilege escalation exploit, CVE-2019-1132, against one of its victims.
The exploit abuses a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft Windows,
speciﬁcally a NULL pointer dereference in the win32k.sys component. Once the exploit
was discovered and analyzed, it was reported to the Microsoft Security Response
Center, who promptly ﬁxed the vulnerability and released a patch.
This blog post covers the evolution of Buhtrap from a ﬁnancial crime to an espionage
mindset.

History
The timeline in Figure 1 highlights some of the most important developments in Buhtrap
activity.

It is always difﬁcult to attribute a campaign to a particular actor when their tools’ source
code is freely available on the web. However, as the shift in targets occurred before the
source code leak, we assess with high conﬁdence that the same people behind the ﬁrst
Buhtrap malware attacks against businesses and banks are also involved in targeting
governmental institutions.
Although new tools have been added to their arsenal and updates applied to older ones,
the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in the different Buhtrap campaigns
have not changed dramatically over all these years. They still make extensive use of
NSIS installers as droppers and these are mainly delivered through malicious
documents. Also, several of their tools are signed with valid code-signing certiﬁcates and
abuse a known, legitimate application to side-load their malicious payloads.
The documents employed to deliver the malicious payloads often come with benign
decoy documents to avoid raising suspicions if the victim opens them. The analysis of
these decoy documents provides clues about who the targets might be. When Buhtrap
was targeting businesses, the decoy documents would typically be contracts or invoices.
Figure 2 is a typical example of a generic invoice the group used in a campaign in 2014.

When the group’s focus shifted to banks, the decoy documents were related to banking
system regulations or advisories from FinCERT, an organization created by the Russian
government to provide help and guidance to its ﬁnancial institutions (such as the
example in Figure 3).

Hence, when we ﬁrst saw decoy documents related to government operations, we
immediately started to track these new campaigns. One of the ﬁrst malicious samples
showing such a change was noticed in December 2015. It downloaded an NSIS installer
whose role was to install the main Buhtrap backdoor, but the decoy document – seen in
Figure 4 – was intriguing.

The URL in the text is revealing. It is very similar to the State Migration Service of
Ukraine website, dmsu.gov.ua. The text, in Ukrainian, asks employees to provide their
contact information, especially their email addresses. It also tries to convince them to
click on the malicious domain included in the text.

This was the ﬁrst of many malicious samples used by the Buhtrap group to target
government institutions we encountered. Another, more recent decoy document that we
believe was also distributed by the Buhtrap group is seen in Figure 5 – a document
which would appeal to a very different set of people, but still government related.

Analysis of the targeted campaigns leading to zero-day
usage
The tools used in the espionage campaigns were very similar to those used against
businesses and ﬁnancial institutions. One of the ﬁrst malicious samples that we analyzed
targeted governmental organizations was a sample with SHA-1 hash
2F2640720CCE2F83CA2F0633330F13651384DD6A. This NSIS installer downloads the
regular package containing the Buhtrap backdoor and displays the decoy document
shown in Figure 4.
Since then, we’ve seen several different campaigns against governmental organizations
coming from this group. In these, they were routinely using vulnerabilities to elevate their
privileges in order to install their malware. We’ve seen them exploit old vulnerabilities
such as CVE-2015-2387. However, they were always known vulnerabilities. The zeroday they used recently was part of the same pattern: using it so that they could run their
malware with the highest privileges.
Throughout the years, packages with different functionalities appeared. Recently, we
found two new packages that are worth describing as they deviate from the typical
toolset.

Legacy backdoor with a twist –

This document contains a malicious macro that, when enabled, drops an NSIS installer
whose task is to prepare installation of the main backdoor. However, this NSIS installer is
very different from the earlier versions used by this group. It is much simpler and is only
used to set the persistence and launch two malicious modules embedded within it.
The ﬁrst module, called “grabber” by its author, is a standalone password stealer. It tries
to harvest passwords from mail clients, browsers, etc., and sends them to a C&C server.
This module was also detected as part of the campaign using the zero-day. This module
uses standard Windows APIs to communicate with its C&C server.

Figure 6. Grabber module network capabilities

The second module is something that we have come to expect from Buhtrap operators:
an NSIS installer containing a legitimate application that will be abused to side load the
Buhtrap main backdoor. The legitimate application that is abused in this case is AVZ, a
free anti-virus scanner.

Meterpreter and DNS tunneling –
C17C335B7DDB5C8979444EC36AB668AE8E4E0A72
This document contains a malicious macro that, when enabled, drops an NSIS installer
whose task is to prepare installation of the main backdoor. Part of the installation
process is to set up ﬁrewall rules to allow the malicious component to communicate with
the C&C server. Next is a command example the NSIS installer uses to set up these
rules:
cmd.exe /c netsh advﬁrewall ﬁrewall add rule name=\”Realtek HD Audio Update Utility\”
dir=in action=allow program=\”<path>\RtlUpd.exe\” enable=yes proﬁle=any
However, the ﬁnal payload is something that we have never seen associated with
Buhtrap. Encrypted in its body are two payloads. The ﬁrst one is a very small shellcode
downloader, while the second one is Metasploit’s Meterpreter. Meterpreter is a reverse
shell that grants its operators full access to the compromised system.
The Meterpreter reverse shell actually uses DNS tunnelling to communicate with its C&C
server by using a module similar to what is described here. Detecting DNS tunnelling
can be difﬁcult for defenders, since all malicious trafﬁc is done via the DNS protocol, as

opposed to the more regular TCP protocol. Below is a snippet of the initial
communication of this malicious module.
7812.reg0.4621.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
7812.reg0.5173.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org

7812.reg0.5314.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
7812.reg0.5361.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org
[…]
The C&C server domain name in this example is impersonating Microsoft. In fact, the
attackers registered different domain names for these campaigns, most of them abusing
Microsoft brands in one way or another.

Conclusion
While we do not know why this group has suddenly shifted targets, it is a good example
of the increasingly blurred lines between pure espionage groups and those primarily
involved in crimeware activities. In this case, it is unclear if one or several members of
this group decided to change focus and for what reasons, but it is deﬁnitely something
that we are likely to see more of going forward.
