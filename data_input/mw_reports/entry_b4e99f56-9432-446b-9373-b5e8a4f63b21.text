Falcon OverWatch and CrowdStrike Intelligence Teams

November 18, 2020

Life on the farm isn’t what it used to be. With overall cyberattacks on the rise, even
agriculture has found itself in the crosshairs of cyber threat actors. In fact, during the last ten
months alone, the CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatchTM team has observed a tenfold
increase in interactive, or hands-on-keyboard, intrusions impacting the agriculture industry.
This blog is the latest installment in a series exploring the types of malicious hands-onkeyboard activity discovered in specific industries by OverWatch threat hunters, who work
with organizations of all sizes – across all industries and in all timezones – to alert them to
these threats. With still over a month to go in 2020, the OverWatch team is on track to
record double the number of targeted and interactive eCrime intrusions uncovered in 2019.
Previous blogs have focused on some of this year’s most frequently targeted industries such
as healthcare and manufacturing. In contrast, this blog takes a deep dive into the agriculture
sector, a less commonly impacted industry that has nonetheless experienced a dramatic
acceleration of intrusion activity in 2020.

OverWatch Threat Hunting Report.

Why Agriculture and Why Now?
The digital transformation of the agriculture sector is expanding it from the physical world into
the cyber realm. While the adoption of internet of things (IoT) and smart technologies opens
the door to innovation and new efficiencies, it also exposes the sector to new cyber threats.
eCrime operations are perpetually looking for new victims, especially among those larger
businesses perceived to have a high capacity to pay. At the other end of the spectrum,
smaller agricultural companies may be seen as soft targets, particularly those in the early
stages of digitizing their businesses with less mature security infrastructure and processes.
In addition, state economic interests are contributing to a heightened interest in the sector,
increasing the likelihood of targeted intrusion activity. To a lesser extent, opportunistic
hacktivism also presents a risk. It is crucial that defenders in the agriculture sector are aware
of the complex global threat landscape that exists for this industry, and are familiar with realworld examples of how adversary activity could play out in their environment.

eCrime Threat
CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed with a high
degree of confidence that eCrime activity is currently
the most likely cyberthreat to the agriculture industry.
This is supported by OverWatch findings — nearly 80%
of interactive intrusions in the agriculture industry in
2020 were perpetrated by suspected eCrime
adversaries (of those intrusions where attribution was
possible).
Large agriculture sector businesses may be viewed as
a valuable target by eCrime adversaries. In “big game
hunting” (BGH) ransomware campaigns, adversaries
will adjust their ransom demands based on a company’s size and perceived capacity to pay,
often resulting in ransoms in the millions of dollars. Organizations should also be aware that
the use of data extortion is increasing among BGH adversaries. Adversaries use this
strategy to increase the likelihood that even those companies with effective data-backup
systems can be pressured to pay ransoms to protect sensitive data from being leaked.
The proliferation of these data encryption and extortion activities has prompted a wide variety
of government policy interventions aimed at both crime prevention and consumer protection.
The onus is on organizations to not only ensure adequate security
protections are in place, but to also be aware of any regional regulatory obligations that
relate to protection of data and dealings with criminal entities.

Targeted Threat
The agricultural industry is at risk of economically
motivated targeted intrusions seeking intellectual
property or other sensitive business information. More
extreme weather patterns, water scarcity and
diminishing availability of productive
land haveencouraged innovation in agricultural
processes, tools and crop varieties. This intellectual
property is a valuable target for countries seeking to
grow their agricultural outputs and boost their
competitive advantage relative to regional neighbors. In
particular, CrowdStrike Intelligence has highlighted
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)-nexus
and China-nexus adversaries as the leading threats.
This is again consistent with OverWatch threat hunting data, which has uncovered both
DPRK- and China-nexus actors involved in intrusions against the agriculture sector in 2020.
The following table summarizes likely motivations and adversary groups involved in these
espionage activities.

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
(DPRK, or North Korea)

China

3/9

Self-sufficiency is a core tenet of the DPRK’s
underlying political philosophy, and agricultural
independence is seen as a key enabling factor for
the country’s growth. Despite the DPRK’s long-held
ambitions to achieve agricultural self-sufficiency,
efforts to modernize and expand the sector have
faced repeated setbacks. These include a lack of
arable land, widespread natural disasters and
limited access to many crucial agricultural inputs
due to DPRK’s government-controlled economy.
In this context, CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses
that proprietary information related to agricultural
production would likely be a significant asset to the
DPRK’s agricultural programs. Two DPRK-nexus
targeted intrusion adversary groups associated with
agricultural sector targeting — LABYRINTH
CHOLLIMA and SILENT CHOLLIMA — are
assessed to conduct espionage operations in
support of the DPRK’s Reconnaissance General
Bureau (RGB) Bureau 121, which could support the
country’s agricultural development goals.

China is the world’s largest
agricultural producing nation,
despite a limited amount of arable
land relative to the country’s size.
The sector accounts for
approximately 10% of China’s total
gross domestic product (GDP) and
employs more than a quarter of the
country’s workforce. For these
reasons, the agricultural sector is
inexorably tied to Chinese
economic growth.
China-nexus adversary groups
engage in aggressive economic
espionage campaigns to forcibly
transfer proprietary technology and
intellectual property from advanced
industrial nations, with the goal of
spurring economic development.
Many of these campaigns have
targeted the 10 industrial areas
highlighted in Beijing’s “Made in
China 2025 Plan,” which includes
agricultural machinery.
The China-nexus adversary
WICKED PANDA is known to target
the agricultural sector for likely
economic espionage goals.

Hacktivist Threat
Finally, agriculture is a sector that attracts attention from
a diverse range of interest groups, among them animal
rights and environmental protection activists. While the
threat level is perceived to be low, organizations in this
industry should remain alert to the possibility of
opportunistic hacktivist activity.

The intrusion story below explores an incident involving a CrowdStrike Falcon® platform
customer in the agriculture sector that did not have Falcon deployed to all workloads in its
network. One of the unmonitored hosts, not covered by Falcon, became the weak point in
the business’s cyber defenses. This single host became a beachhead from which an eCrime
adversary was able to achieve lateral movement and commence credential harvesting
activities. CrowdStrike strongly recommends customers deploy full sensor coverage across
their environment to ensure that there are no weak points in their defense. This case study
shows how quickly an eCrime adversary can navigate a victim’s environment once they have
managed to gain access. It also details how OverWatch threat hunters acted equally rapidly
to find the intrusion and enable this agricultural business to eradicate the adversary from
their environment, despite only having limited visibility within the network environment.

Threat Hunting Enables Timely Pest Control Against SPIDER Adversary
Recently, Falcon OverWatch discovered a suspected interactive SPIDER (aka eCrime)
intrusion against a large agriculture company. In the early morning, outside of the customer’s
normal operating hours, OverWatch hunters uncovered suspicious discovery commands
being executed on a Windows host under a process that was unique in the customer’s
environment. OverWatch regularly uses telemetry from across the global Falcon install base
to rapidly identify activity that is anomalous and worthy of further investigation. In this
instance, the unique binary was:
FILE: C:\Windows\IntelliAdminRPC\RemoteExecute.exe
HASH: aa63dfec54e9bdf529fdad1fe47eee45391a99b007878abf56a490b023e6b245

This binary is associated with commercially available remote administration software.
However, the hunters recognized it as only present on this one host within this customer’s
network environment, along with suspicious commands spawned from it, so they continued
hunting further.
Within the first three minutes of establishing a presence on the host, the adversary executed
several basic initial reconnaissance commands using the RemoteExecute.exe process:
ver
systeminfo
net group \"Domain Admins\" /domain
netstat -ano -p tcp

OverWatch threat hunters immediately notified the victim of the suspicious activity before
commencing a more detailed investigation into the source of the intrusion.
Retracing the Adversary’s Steps
5/9

OverWatch found that the RemoteExecute.exe binary was written to the victim host by
another host within the network’s VPN range. That other host did not have the Falcon sensor
installed, which meant that OverWatch did not have visibility to identify the intrusion at initial
access. This allowed the adversary to establish an internal beachhead from which they
executed their commands remotely.

Figure 1. Intrusion sequence showing the adversary’s movement between hosts (click image to enlarge)

Five minutes after gaining access to the host OverWatch could see, the adversary modified
the registry to implement a widely known procedure that enables credentials to be stored in
clear text within memory, facilitating credential theft:
reg add hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\securityproviders\wdigest /v
UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /F

Roughly 15 minutes later, after running additional basic host and network discovery
commands, the adversary ran the following command:
"c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe" /c rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll,
MiniDump 576 c:\windows\temp\TMPdx12.dmp full

This is an example of a known technique for creating a minidump of the LSASS process to
extract credentials without using Mimikatz. In this particular method, the adversary abused
the Windows native comsvcs.dll dynamic link library (DLL), executing the binary via
rundll32.exe to perform the credential dumping. This binary is generally associated with
legitimate Windows COM+ Services. Thanks to the Falcon sensor’s defenses, the credential
dumping attempt did not succeed.

6/9

Next, the adversary executed the script %SYSTEMROOT%\IntelliAdminRPC\inst.bat ,
which resulted in a series of commands consistent with those within a publicly shared
registry file. In doing so, the adversary implemented a form of Component Object Model
(COM) hijacking in an attempt to create persistence and execute their tooling without
detection. The adversary next attempted to finalize persistence by registering a scheduled
task masquerading as “GoogleUpdates” in order to spawn their backdoor every 30 minutes:
"c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe" /c cmd /c schtasks /create /F /SC minute /MO
30 /TN "\UpdateTasks\GoogleUpdates" /TR "rundll32 /sta {[CLSID for Hijacked
COM Object]}"

It is unclear if the adversary’s inst.bat script functioned as intended, as they proceeded
to run it multiple times over the course of the next hour. This activity took place concurrently
with further account, host and network discovery.
During that time period, the adversary also attempted to save the SAM and SYSTEM registry
hives for attempted credential access and created a new user account with a password set
to not expire. Next, they executed the following commands to employ further variations of
attempted credential dumping, but Falcon blocked these efforts as well:
powershell -ep bypass "Import-Module
c:\windows\system32\catroot\mini.ps1;Get-Process lsass | Out-Minidump"

(Likely the PowerSploit Minidump script)
procdump64.exe

-accepteula -ma lsass.exe dmp.se.dmp

Threat hunting ensured the timely discovery and disruption of this eCrime intrusion.
OverWatch tracked the adversary from the initial attempt to access a Falcon-protected
endpoint until the customer used the Falcon platform to isolate the victim host, containing the
intrusion and avoiding a potential breach. After the immediate threat was addressed,
OverWatch reviewed all related malicious activity in detail. Hunters used this information to
hone their preparation for this adversary by identifying features of these malicious actions
that will inform future threat hunting efforts. Feeding key observations like this into future
hunting leads is an essential part of the iterative threat hunting process, as described in a
blog outlining the OverWatch SEARCH hunting methodology.
This incident also serves as an important reminder of the very real threat that eCrime poses
to the agriculture sector. This is particularly true in the context of the sudden and
unprecedented spike in intrusion activity that OverWatch has recorded in this sector in recent
months. Businesses that have until now considered themselves an unlikely target for
interactive threats should take notice of the shifting cyber landscape. Now is the time to look
at measures to mature security posture preemptively.

7/9

While this attack could have been opportunistic rather than specifically focusing on an
agriculture target, it is at least indicative of the threats agriculture organizations face. For

intrusion against a global agriculture company, be sure to check out the 2020 OverWatch
Threat Hunting Report. The story Hunting Thwarts LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA Attack
Launched Over Social Media walks through an intrusion perpetrated by a state-sponsored
adversary.

Security Recommendations
Threat Hunting
The eCrime intrusion chronicled in this blog demonstrates the critical importance of threat
hunting supported by comprehensive visibility across the environment at all hours of the day.
In this case, the lack of OverWatch visibility into the initially compromised host enabled the
adversary to establish a beachhead on this unmonitored part of the network. Yet despite
having gained access to the network through the customer’s VPN pool, proactive threat
hunting was there to catch them as soon as they tried to perform actions on endpoints
covered by Falcon. Further, despite this intrusion taking place in the early morning, the
Overwatch team’s continuous hunting meant that the breach was rapidly discovered and
reported, so the victim could disrupt the adversary and stop the breach before further
impact.
We strongly recommend that defenders implement proactive threat hunting as part of
their defense-in-depth strategy, to support the timely discovery and disruption of
adversary tradecraft designed to evade detection by systems built on technology
alone.
Organizations should also deploy capabilities that provide their threat hunters with full
visibility across the entire network’s workloads to avoid blind spots that can become a
safe haven for adversaries.
Finally, it is crucial that organizations employ continuous threat hunting. The longer an
adversary has access to your network, the greater the risk of serious impact to your
operations. OverWatch’s 24/7/365 hunting ensures that adversaries have nowhere to
hide, even when your staff is off the clock.

Security Hygiene
It is crucial to plug gaps in your defenses. OverWatch routinely sees adversaries finding and
exploiting the weakest point of entry. All too often, that point of weakness is an organization’s
VPN or another remote access setup, but it can also be an unpatched vulnerability or simply
the part of a victim’s environment without Falcon sensor coverage.

8/9

Defenders should regularly monitor VPN and other remote access account behavior to
identify anomalous behavior, particularly given the increase in remote work many
organizations have implemented due to COVID-19.

Know Your Adversary
The best defenses are always built on the latest and most comprehensive cyber threat
intelligence. OverWatch threat hunters and Crowdstrike Intelligence work hand-in-hand to
continually feed the threat intelligence lifecycle, allowing you to stay one step ahead of the
adversary.
Defenders in all settings should develop a deep understanding of the threat landscape
for their organization. Staying up-to-date with key adversaries, their motivations, and
their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) will support data-backed, proactive
security decisions.
