Phishes Found in Environments Protected by SEGs

By Elmer Hernandez, Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC)
The Cofense Phishing Defence Center (PDC) has uncovered a wide-ranging attempt to
compromise credentials from five different African financial institutions. Posing as tax
collection authorities, adversaries seek to collect account numbers, user IDs, PINs and cell
phone numbers from unsuspecting customers.
One such email, which was found in environments protected by Proofpoint and Microsoft,
alleges to come from the South African Revenue Service’s (SARS) eFiling service. It claims
a tax return deposit of R12,560.5 (South African Rands), approximately $700 USD, has been
made to the user’s account and urges them to click on their financial institution in order to
claim it. The real sender of the email, however, appears to be a personal Gmail address that
may have been created or compromised by the adversaries.

metric.

Each of the images embedded in the email corresponds to a different bank. Clicking on any
of these will take the user to a spoofed login portal corresponding to the selected bank. The
spoofed banks include ABSA, Capitec, First National Bank (FNB), Nedbank and Standard
Bank, all of which are based in South Africa. The lookalike sites are located at

the time of analysis, only the site for Standard Bank was unavailable. Figures below -6 show
the phishing portals imitating each bank.

All spoofed portals were created using Webnode, a website building service known for its
friendly drag and drop features. Despite this ease of use, adversaries have kept things rather
simple, as all portals are basic forms with a few or no images. The portals ask for a variety of
personal information, including account numbers, passwords, PINs and even cell phone
numbers.

Adversaries can access all entries directly from the form itself. They can also receive
notifications to an email address of their choosing every time a submission is made; the
Gmail account used to send the phishing email may also be where adversaries are notified
of each and every new victim. Webnode also allows the export of form submission data in
xml and csv formats.
Webnode therefore is an optimal way to store and retrieve stolen user data. There is no need
for additional infrastructure, nor to compromise any third parties. As in the case of the
Standard Bank portal, the risk of discovery and subsequent closure of spoofed sites means
adversaries can lose access to any unretrieved information. However, this risk seems to be
offset by the ease with which replacement spoofed sites can be created.
