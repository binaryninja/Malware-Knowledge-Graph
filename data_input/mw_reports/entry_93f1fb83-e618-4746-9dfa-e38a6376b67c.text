Summary
At the beginning of 2021, Emotet was considered to be the world’s most dangerous malware
by Europol. The threat was first discovered in 2014 when it was acting as a banking trojan.
Over the years, the malware evolved into one of the most relevant botnets in the threat
landscape, often used to deliver other threats, such as Trickbot and Ryuk ransomware.
Netskope detected Emotet during Oct 2020, using PowerShell and WMI to download and
execute its payload.
After massive collaboration between law enforcement agencies around the world, Emotet
was taken down in January 2021, where the malware’s infrastructure was disrupted from the
inside. This was extremely important, as infected machines were redirected towards law
enforcement-controlled infrastructure, preventing further actions from Emotet’s threat actors.
After almost a year, Emotet (a.k.a. Geodo, Heodo) was spotted again in the wild, being
delivered by Trickbot. This new campaign is being tracked by MalwareBazaar / Feodo
Tracker, where we can see an increase since November 15, 2021.

In this threat coverage, we will analyze a malicious Microsoft Office document from a set of
files that are delivering the new Emotet payload.

Analysis
Once we open the document, we can see a fake message that lures the victim into enabling
the macros, by clicking the “Enable Editing” and “Enable Content” buttons.

2/9

Malicious document that delivers Emotet.
The threat actors protected the VBA project with a password to prevent viewing the macro in
the VBA editor, likely to slow down analysis.

Protected VBA project.

After bypassing this protection, we can see that the document contains an obfuscated macro
code.

3/9

Macro code executed by the document.
There are a few functions that are not used at all, possibly added as decoys. The main code
is triggered by the “Document_Open()” function.
Function triggered
once the document is opened.
By looking at the function called by this entry point, we can see the threat actors attempt to
hide a PowerShell script by using string concatenation and replace, which can all be easily
removed.

4/9

The VBA code goal is to execute a PowerShell script, that basically iterates over a URL list,
and tries to download the content into “ C:\ProgramData\ ”.

Once an online URL is found, Emotet’s DLL is written into the disk with a random name, for
example: “ C:\ProgramData\1856230245.dll ”.
At the time of our analysis, three of the URLs were offline.

The downloaded file is a 32-bit DLL, and although this information is not 100% reliable, it
looks like the file was compiled on November 16, 2021.

The final payload is another DLL, which is unpacked and executed in memory by the
downloaded file.

6/9

Emotet being unpacked in memory.
Once running, Emotet starts the communication with its C2 servers.

7/9

Emotet C2 communication.
At the moment of this analysis, there are 19 online servers linked to Emotet.
