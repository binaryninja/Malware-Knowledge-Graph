Mobile Malware App Anubis Strikes Again, Continues to LureUsers Disguised as a Fake Antivirus
Anubis is an Android banking Trojan created and advertised by a threat actor with the nickname “maza-in”. This malware
family has been conducting well-known overlay attacks by combining advanced features such as the capability to stream
screens, record sounds, browse files remotely, keylogging abilities, and the capability to function as a network proxy.
These features make it an effective banking malware and a potential tool for spying.
Generally, this malware operates by tricking unsuspecting victims into submitting confidential and sensitive information
such as online banking credentials, banking security codes, and Credit Card details. Being a banking Trojan does not
mean that the Anubis malware variant will masquerade as a banking app; in most cases, it is disguised as a third-party
app. Some of the disguises used by Anubis are fake mobile games, software updates, post/mail apps, flash-player apps,
utility apps, fake browsers and even social-network and communication apps.
The list of malware features of Anubis is shown below:
Overlaying: Static (hardcoded in bot)
Overlaying: Dynamic (C2 based)
Keylogging

Contact list collection
Screen streaming
Sound recording
SMS harvesting: SMS forwarding
SMS blocking
SMS sending
Files/pictures collection
Calls: USSD request making
Ransomware: Cryptolocker
Remote actions: Data-wiping
Remote actions: Back-connect proxy
Notifications: Push notifications
C2 Resilience: Twitter/Telegram C2 update channels
Some of the common delivery techniques that are used by Anubis malware are:
Google Play campaigns:
This includes Bypassing Google Play security mechanisms and spreading the Trojan using the official app store.
Spam campaigns:
This uses SMS or emails with a request to install or update some legitimate application that links to the malware.
Web redirection:
Using advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges lures the victim to a fake landing page containing
a malware app.
In a recent tweet, a security engineer shared information about a fake antivirus android app camouflaged as a wellknown antivirus and available from an unsecured web source. When users access the unsecure link available
from the search engine for download, it navigates them to an Index page with the file content named as “Avast Antivirus
ULTIMATE 2021.apk”, and on selecting it, users can download the APK file.
On scanning the downloaded file through VirusTotal, it turned out to be a variant of the Banking Trojan Anubis detected
by multiple antivirus signatures, as shown in Figure 1.

Main Activity: wocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.ncec.myvbo
Upon performing static analysis on the above app, the malware was found to be more like the Cerberus Banking Trojan
malware, which also steals victim data to access their bank accounts. The permissions used by this malware are listed
below in the Fig. 3

Figure 3Permissions requested by the app
After opening the application, it requests users to enable the accessibility service from the settings to enable full access
to the app. After that, it lures victims into changing the Accessibility settings on their phones, forbidding them to uninstall
the app. Also, through this service, the app executes screen taps and other commands without the user’s knowledge.

All the data collected from the devices are then sent to the C2 link, which seems to be encrypted in this app, and the
encryption technique used is AES along with the key, as shown below in the Fig. 12.lo

Following are the ways in which the above encryption techniques are used in multiple classes and methods, as shown in
Fig. 13.

On decrypting the above string and on performing the Dynamic analysis on the same, we found that the collected
data is sent to the well-known C2 link of the Anubis variant.

Under normal circumstances, before downloading, users can identify whether an APK is authentic or fake based on
the following criteria:

1. Source of the file (Secure/Not secure) is a good indicator of whether the app is genuine or fake. For
instance, before downloading an application from an unkown source such as a web URL, it is important to check if
the source is secure.
1. Size of the app. For example, the size of a fake app is less when compared with an authentic one.
1. Spelling errors or Icon mismatches can also help distinguish fake apps from genuine ones.

9/11

By these parameters, the APK downloaded from the provided URL was identified as a fake app. In addition, the size of
the downloaded app is around 500 KB, while commonly, any antivirus APK size would be around a few MBs. Also, the
source of the file in this case is an unsecure site, which would not have been the case for an authentic app that is
published either in their website that redirects to an authentic app store.
Safety Recommendations:
1. Keep your antivirus software updated to detect and prevent malware infections.
1. Keep your system and applications updated.
1. Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication during logins.
1. Verify the privileges and permissions requested by the app before granting access.
1. People concerned about the exposure of their stolen credentials in the dark web can register
at AmiBreached.com to ascertain their exposure.
