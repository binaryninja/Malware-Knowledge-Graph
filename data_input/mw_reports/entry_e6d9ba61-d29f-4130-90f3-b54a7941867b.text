Operation Overtrap Targets
Japanese Online Banking Users
Via Bottle Exploit Kit and
Brand-New Cinobi Banking Trojan
Technical Brief
By Jaromir Horejsi and Joseph C. Chen (Threat Researchers)

We recently discovered a new campaign that we dubbed “Operation Overtrap” for the
numerous ways it can infect or trap victims with its payload. The campaign mainly
targets online users of various Japanese banks by stealing their banking credentials
using a three-pronged attack. Based on our telemetry, Operation Overtrap has been
active since April 2019 and has been solely targeting online banking users located in
Japan. Our analysis shows that this campaign uses three different attack vectors to
steal its victims’ banking credentials:
•
•
•

By sending spam emails with a phishing link to a page disguised as a banking
website
By sending spam emails asking victims to execute a disguised malware’s
executable downloaded from a linked phishing page.
By using a custom exploit kit to deliver malware via malvertising

Technical Analysis
Discovering Operation Overtrap
We first discovered the campaign in September 2019 using a then-unidentified exploit
kit. Based on our data, Operation Overtrap has been using spam emails to deliver its
payload to victims as early as April 2019.
In mid-September, we observed a significant number of victims being redirected to the
exploit kit, which targeted Internet Explorer, after they have clicked on links from social

media platforms. It should be noted, however, that the way the victims received the links
has not been identified. It is also worth mentioning that Operation Overtrap only seems
to target Japanese online banking users; it redirects victims with different geolocations
to a fake online shop.
Our analysis revealed that the exploit kit only dropped a clean binary that does not
perform malicious activities on a victim’s device. It also immediately closes after
infection. It is still unclear why the threat actors behind Operation Overtrap initially
delivered a clean binary file; it’s possible that they were testing their custom exploit kit
during this stage of the campaign’s development.

Operation Overtrap’s Custom Exploit Kit: Bottle Exploit Kit
On September 29, 2019, we observed that the exploit kit ceased to drop a clean file,
and instead, delivered a brand-new banking trojan that we dubbed “Cinobi.” We also
noted that the threat actors behind Operation Overtrap have stopped redirecting victims
from social media and began to use a Japan-targeted malvertising campaign to push
their custom exploit kit.
Another researcher later discovered the custom exploit kit, which was named the Bottle
Exploit Kit (BottleEK). It exploits CVE-2018-15982, a Flash Player use after free
vulnerability, as well as CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript remote code execution
vulnerability. Victims will be infected with BottleEK’s payload if they access this

particular exploit kit’s landing page with unpatched or outdated browsers. Our telemetry
shows that BottleEK was the most active exploit kit detected in Japan in February 2020.

Figure 4. Exploit kit activity observed in Japan on February 2020 (Data obtained from
Trend Micro Smart Protection Network™)
BottleEK performs the following steps during the compromise of an infected machine:
1. Check if the browser cookie “username” has been set. If it’s set, it will not perform
any action. Otherwise, it will set a “username” cookie with the value “bingv” and
continue the infection. This step aims to filter out victims who have been previously
attacked to prevent a double infection.

information
2. Check if the browser is Internet Explorer and if the browser language is set to
Japanese. If not, it will stop the infection.

Figure 6. Screengrab of code showing the BottleEK script checking the infected device’s
browser language and browser version
3. Check the version of Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash Player, and the architecture of
the infected machine. It then sends the gathered information with an Ajax request to
the exploit kit hosting server in this format:
“/conn.php?callback=?data1={Internet Explorer version}&data2={64 bits or 32 bits
architecture}&data3={Adobe Flash Player version}”.

Figure 7. Screengrab of the BottleEK script sending information of the victim machine
and loading the corresponding exploit
4. Based on the information received by the exploit kit server, it will return the location
of different exploit codes and instruct the browser to load them accordingly. The
exploits used by BottleEK include CVE-2018-15982, an Adobe Flash exploit, and
CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript engine exploit.
5. After successful exploitation, it will load the malware from the URL
“/conn[.]php?ge=1” and execute it. It is worth noting that if the cookie “username”
set during the first step is not present during the request to load the exploit, the

exploit kit server will return an empty response. This is an anti-crawl feature that
prevents web crawlers from directly grabbing the campaign’s payloads.
An analysis of the shellcodes embedded and executed by the exploits reveals the use
of Metasploit encoders. In the case of 32-bit shellcode, we observed the use of the
Shikata Ga Nai encoder. Meanwhile, the 64-bit shellcode uses XOR dynamic encoder.

shellcodes in one exploit file

Brand-new banking malware: Cinobi
Operation Overtrap used a new banking malware we’ve decided to call Cinobi. Based
on our analysis, Cinobi has two versions — the first one has a DLL library injection
payload that compromises victims’ web browsers to perform form-grabbing.
This Cinobi version can also modify web traffic sent to and received from targeted
websites. Our investigation found that all the websites that this campaign targeted were
those of Japan-based banks.
Aside from form-grabbing, it also has a webinject function that allows cybercriminals the
ability to modify accessed webpages. The second version has all the capabilities of the
first one plus the ability to communicate with a command-and-control (C&C) server over
the Tor proxy.

Cinobi’s four stages of infection
Each of Cinobi’s four stages contains an encrypted position-independent shellcode that
makes analysis slightly more complicated. Each stage is downloaded from a C&C
server after certain conditions have been met.

First stage
The first stage of Cinobi’s infection chain, which has also been analyzed by another
cybersecurity researcher, starts by calling the “GetUserDefaultUILanguages”
function to check if the infected device’s local settings are set to Japanese.

Figure 5. Screengrab of Cinobi’s check to determine the device’s language settings using
“GetUserDefaultUILanguages”

Cinobi will then download legitimate unzip.exe and Tor applications from the following
locations:
•
•

ftp://ftp[.]cadwork.ch/DVD_V20/cadwork.dir/COM/unzip[.]exe
https://archive[.]torproject[.]org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/8.0.8/torwin32-0.3.5.8[.]zip

After extracting the Tor archive into the “\AppData\LocalLow\” directory, Cinobi will
rename tor.exe to taskhost.exe and execute it. It will also run tor.exe with custom torrc
file settings.

•
•

"C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\<random_name>\Tor\taskhost.exe" –f
"C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\<random_name>\torrc"

It will download the second stage of the malware payload from a .onion C&C address
and save it in a randomly named .DLL file within the “\AppData\LocalLow\” folder. The
filename of the first stage downloader is saved into a .JPG file with a random name.

Figure 6. Screengrab of .JPG file that contains the filename of the first stage
downloader

After this, Cinobi will run the second stage of its downloader on the victim’s machine.

Figure 7. Screengrab of code showing Cinobi running the second stage of its
downloader on the victim’s machine

Second stage
Cinobi will connect to its C&C server to download and decrypt the file for the third stage
of its infection chain. We observed that the filename of the third stage starts with the
letter C, followed by random characters. Afterward, it will download and decrypt the file
for the fourth stage, which has a filename that starts with the letter A, followed by
random characters.
After these, Cinobi will download and decrypt a config file (<random_name>.txt) that
contains a new C&C address.
Cinobi uses RC4 encryption with a hardcoded key.

Figure 8. Screengrab of code showing Cinobi’s decoded config file

Next, Cinobi will run the downloaded third stage infection file using the UAC bypass
method via the CMSTPLUA COM interface.

Third stage
During the third infection stage, Cinobi will copy malware files from
“\AppData\LocalLow\” to the “%PUBLIC%” folder. It will then install the fourth stage of
the downloader (which was downloaded during the second stage) as Winsock Layered
Service Provider (WSCInstallProviderAndChains).

Figure 9. Screengrab of code showing the installation of the infection’s fourth stage
on the victim machine as “WSCInstallProviderAndChains”

Cinobi will then perform the following actions:
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

Change spooler service config to “SERVICE_AUTO_START”
Disable the following services:
o UsoSvc
o Wuauserv
o WaaSMedicSvc
o SecurityHealthService
o DisableAntiSpyware
Copy and extract Tor files to “%PUBLIC%” folder
Rename tor.exe to taskhost.exe
Create torrc in “%PUBLIC%” with the content “DataDirectory
C:\Users\Public\<random_nam>\data\tor”
Create .JPG file with the original dropper name
Remove files from “\AppData\LocalLow\” and remove the original dropper file

Fourth stage
Cinobi will call the WSCEnumProtocols function to retrieve information about available
transport protocols. It will also call the WSCGetProviderPath function to retrieve the
DLL path of the original transport provider. This function is called twice. The first call will
return the malicious provider (as the fourth stage of the malware has already been

installed during the third stage of infection). The second call will return the original
transport provider (“%SystemRoot%\system32\mswsock.dll”) and resolve and call its
WSPStartup function. Cinobi will then check the name of the process in which the
malicious DLL provider gets injected. In practice, Cinobi should be injected into all
processes that make network connections using Windows sockets.

injected

Cinobi’s Dropped Configuration files
Cinobi drops various configuration files while running though all four stages of infection.
All these files have different extensions and are encrypted with the same hardcoded
RC4 key. We have decrypted the configuration files and analyzed them below:
•

<random_name>.bmp contains a list of targeted financial institutions.

•

<random_name>.cfg contains an environment hash, which is a unique identifier
for a victim machine.

•

<random_name>.png contains web injects. As seen from screenshot below, the
file only contains “localhost” with a random string. This may indicate that the
threat actor does not need to use web injects at all.

•
•

<random_name>.txt contains a list of C&C servers.
<random_name>.wmv contains a link for downloading an older Google Chrome
version (Chrome 53) because, as mentioned in this paper, this particular version
of Google Chrome uses a “completely different virtual method table” to search for
SSL functions to hook. It seems that the attackers have yet to develop a working
method for hooking newer Chrome SSL functions.

Running Cinobi banking Trojan
To fully analyze the Cinobi banking Trojan, we ran it on a testing machine. In order to
run Cinobi, the machine’s system must be set to Japanese locale or, to bypass the
locale check, patch the downloader from the first stage of the infection.

Testing web injects
Even though web injects were not used in this campaign, we tested the web injects by
running a simple webserver with a website containing the keyword “opqrst.” According
to the dropped configuration settings, “opqrst” should be appended with the keyword
“aaaaaaa” on an infected machine.
•

To do this test, we first ran an HTTP server using the Python SimpleHTTPServer
module.

•

We then created the “index.html” webpage with the following content:

•

We opened localhost on the web browser and found seven consecutive letter As
injected after each “opqrst” keyword. This proves that the web injects work.

Testing the form-grabbing feature
To test Cinobi’s form-grabbing feature, we loaded a website belonging to one of the
targeted financial institutions and attempted to input data into one of its HTML forms to
see what happens when the form is submitted.

•

•

We proceeded to enter random digits (we used 7777, 8888, and 99999) on one
of the HTML forms, .

Soon after, we observed the creation of a randomly named .txt file with content
that was encrypted with the same RC4 password as the other configuration files.
After decrypting the .txt file, it revealed the decrypted HTTPS request. The userentered data is shown below, in red. This .txt file is submitted to the banking
trojan’s C&C server.

Connections to previous phishing attacks
Although we have identified that the Cinobi banking trojan is mainly being dropped by
the Bottle exploit kit, we have also observed similar samples being distributed in the
wild since April 2019. These samples look almost similar to the Cinobi banking trojan,
but without the ability to download, install, and communicate over the Tor proxy. We
suspect that these samples were the earlier version of Cinobi (marked as Cinobi V1)
and the one with the Tor functionality we received from BottleEK is the second version
(marked as Cinobi V2).
Another connection relates to the domain used by Cinobi V1’s C&C server
(cionx[.]inteleksys[.]com), which has the same base domain as the server of Bottle
exploit kit (sales[.]inteleksys[.]com). We noticed that the campaign reuses the domain
inteleksys[.]com but uses different subdomains. It is worth noting that the domain was
used to host a legitimate website, but after its registration expired, cybercriminals reregistered it and started using it for malicious purposes. It is also possible that the
originally legitimate domain is included in cybersecurity solutions’ whitelists.
During the investigation of Cinobi V1, we found that the malware was not distributed via
exploit kit, but was distributed with a phishing page sent via spam email. The phishing
page was disguised as an office bank website asking victims to install a new certificate
to enhance security measures. However, the link to the certificate file is Cinobi V1’s
loader.
The Cinobi V1 phishing page could also be found via several domains that use
typosquatting techniques to fool internet users who mistype domains belonging to
legitimate Japanese banks on their internet browsers.

Figure 11. Example of a phishing page that contains the Cinobi V1 loader (Screenshot
from urlscan.io)
When we checked the domains linking these phishing pages, we found that one of the
IP addresses, 118[.]27[.]34[.]110, was associated with other phishing domains and
overlapped with another domain, “ts3cardd[.com],” which was used in a phishing attack
delivered via spam email, according to an alert issued by one of the targeted banks.
We also learned that the registration information of a phishing domain used to deliver
Cinobi V1 overlapped with several domains hosting Amazon-themed phishing sites.
These connections show that this campaign might also employ typical phishing attacks
to grab credentials from unsuspecting victims.

(japanp0st.jp) delivering Cinobi V1 and an Amazon-themed phishing site (safetbamazon[.]jp).
Note: The profile used in the domain information is fake

Best practices against spam and vulnerabilities
Operation Overtrap uses a variety of attack vectors to steal banking credentials. Users
and organizations need to adopt best practices to ensure that their systems are
protected against messaging-related threats as well as falling prey to malicious
advertisements. An example of a best practice an organization must have is having a
central point for reporting suspicious emails. Organizations, through their IT teams,
need to have a centralized information gathering system. For this to be effective, all
employees must be aware of the reporting procedure for suspicious emails. Meanwhile,
to avoid malicious advertisements, users should be wary of clicking suspicious links or
pop-ups and make sure to actively update software via official channels only.
Organizations will greatly benefit from regularly updating systems (or use virtual
patching for legacy systems) to prevent attackers from taking advantage of security
gaps. Additional security mechanisms like enabling firewalls and intrusion detection and
prevention systems will help thwart suspicious network activities that may indicate red
flags like data exfiltration or C&C communication.
