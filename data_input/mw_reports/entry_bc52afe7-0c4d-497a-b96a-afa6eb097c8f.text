FOREWORD
Welcome to the latest edition of the CrowdStrike® Services Cyber Front Lines
Report!
In the year since our last report was published, a pandemic has changed not only
cybersecurity practices globally, but also our jobs as defenders in the digital space.
Our jobs as defenders are more complicated, require more advanced skills and are
more important now than ever. Moving from a traditional corporate IT stack to a
global “work from anywhere” workforce in a few short weeks was truly a remarkable
undertaking for many organizations, and the adversaries took notice. Attackers —
both eCrime and state-sponsored — continued to quickly adapt to broad industry
changes in an effort to leapfrog legacy defenses, deploy new ransomware and
execute data extortion attacks. They persisted in exploiting the path of least
resistance, facilitated by the increased attack surface created by the remote
workforce, preying on victims’ emotions and corporate vulnerabilities.
We learned the basic cybersecurity principles we’ve always advocated remain critical:
asset inventory, vulnerability management, multifactor authentication, network
segmentation, system backup and recovery, and more. Our Services mission has
always been focused on helping organizations train for, react to and remediate a
breach quickly and effectively to allow them to get back to business faster. In light of
the events of 2020, we have organized our responders into “Front-Line Teams” that
have a stronger and more defined focus on each of these essential areas:
I ncident Response (IR): Rapid response, containment and investigation with
digital forensics and root cause analysis
 ndpoint Recovery Services: Containment of active threats, recovery and
E
remediation with speed and surgical precision
 alcon Complete™: Continuous 24/7/365 managed detection, response and
F
remediation, backed by up to $1M Breach Prevention Warranty
This report outlines trends we’ve identified in the data we collect from hundreds
of engagements, along with key themes we’ve observed, to enable you to better
protect your organization. I encourage you to review it from your perspective — in
a similar situation, what would you, your teams and your organizational leadership
do? Perhaps more importantly, how would you fare? Identifying your vulnerabilities,
becoming more aware and educating yourself is half the battle.

We know attackers will continue to refine their techniques and strengthen their skills
to evade security, monetize their access and/or reach their ultimate objective. The
year 2020 saw more intrusions than ever before, larger ransomware demands and
little opportunity for organizations to improve their security posture while keeping
pace with the chaos brought on by the global pandemic. Corporate defenders are
spread thin, and adversaries are well organized and better funded than ever, making
it much more difficult to detect and respond to threats.
All is not lost though. CrowdStrike is steadfastly helping our customers move from
simply reacting to breaches days or weeks after the fact to continuous monitoring,
detection, response and optimization. We are glad you trust us to provide you with
the support you need to safeguard your critical assets, especially in these uncertain
times. We appreciate your confidence and thank you for your partnership.
One team, one fight.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The CrowdStrike Services Cyber Front Lines Report brings together the insights and
observations of dedicated CrowdStrike team members from all corners of the globe,
who work tirelessly to help organizations defend against and recover from intrusions
every day. Not only does the report provide a clear picture of how adversaries are
adapting to today’s realities, it also includes concrete recommendations that you can
implement in your organization today to improve your cybersecurity readiness.
The findings and trends in this report are derived from data points and insights collected
from a wide variety of incident response (IR) engagements and proactive services
activities over the past 12 months. Key findings from these metrics include:
The volume and velocity of financially motivated attacks are staggering.
Financially motivated attacks represented 63% of CrowdStrike Services cases
over the past year, with 81% of financially motivated attacks involving the
deployment of ransomware or a precursor to ransomware activities.
 uying technology alone is not enough — configuration, coverage and
B
management matters. In at least 30% of incident response engagements,
CrowdStrike observed the organization’s antivirus solutions were either
incorrectly configured with weak prevention settings or not fully deployed
across the environment, which may have been a factor in the threat actor
gaining and maintaining access.
I ntrusions should not be thought of as a one-time event. The Services team
looked at organizations that experienced an intrusion and then leveraged
CrowdStrike to manage their endpoint protection and remediation efforts
moving forward. CrowdStrike identified that 68% of those organizations
experienced another intrusion attempt, which was prevented.
Shifting to continuous monitoring and response changes the game.
Rather than thinking of intrusion response as a one-off emergency activity,
mature organizations plan for real-time, continuous monitoring and response.
CrowdStrike’s Falcon Complete managed service offering reduced the average
time to detect, investigate and remediate from a total of 162 hours — nearly
seven days — to less than one hour for customers.
Outside counsel is playing a bigger role in the incident response process.
Outside counsel retained CrowdStrike to advise its clients in 49% of the
incidents investigated in 2020.

In addition to these findings, CrowdStrike’s incident responders identified a number of
key themes in 2020. Organizations should be mindful of the following:
Widespread remote work has broad-reaching effects on cybersecurity.
Networks around the world were turned inside out as office workers became
remote workers, with dramatic effects on how attackers target organizations
and how defenders must react.
Ransomware actors have learned new tricks. Not content with just encrypting
data for extortion, eCrime actors are increasingly destroying and/or threatening
to leak data, as they target ever-larger ransom payments.

The volume and
velocity of financially
motivated attacks are
staggering.

Cloud infrastructure requires special attention from defenders. The global
pandemic accelerated digital transformation — including cloud adoption —
for many organizations, and attackers took advantage of this attack surface.
Defending the cloud requires additional planning and focus beyond traditional
on-premises networks.
Weaknesses in public-facing applications and services are increasingly
dangerous. CrowdStrike observed significant increases in attackers targeting
public-facing applications and services in 2020. Defenders must continue to
be vigilant to ensure no exterior gaps exist for an adversary to use as an initial
foothold.
State-sponsored adversaries leave smaller footprints. While eCrime
actors got most of the headlines in 2020, state-sponsored adversaries
remained active across a wide range of sectors. Detecting and stopping these
sophisticated intrusions requires a well-coordinated and holistic response.
Organizations focused on driving key security enhancements can stop the
next breach. An intrusion can happen to any organization — how you respond
and learn from prior incidents can make a significant difference on the impact
of the next breach.
Organizations that heed the observations and recommendations in this report will see
significant improvements in their ability to defend against many of the common types of
attacks. CrowdStrike is here to help, providing highly skilled cybersecurity professionals
who partner with clients, ensuring that the adversaries are defeated and any damage is
quickly remediated.

INCIDENT RESPONSE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES FROM 2020 AND INSIGHTS THAT MATTER FOR 2021

KEY FINDINGS: DEMOGRAPHICS AND METRICS
In keeping with the format of last year’s CrowdStrike Services Cyber Front Lines
Report, this year’s edition reflects data derived from CrowdStrike Services incident
response, managed services and proactive services engagements over 2020. The
real-world observations and analysis presented in this report should prove both
compelling and practical, as well as the recommendations you can implement within
your organization to improve your cybersecurity readiness. The organizations
assisted by CrowdStrike during 2020 spanned 15 industry sectors, resided in 34
countries, and varied in size from large global organizations to regionally focused
small/mid-sized businesses (SMBs). Of note, CrowdStrike served 25% of the
Fortune 100 and 9% of the Global 100 organizations in 2020.

Industry Sectors

While the demographics of the organizations supported and the incidents
investigated evolve year to year, one thing has remained constant: Cyber adversaries
continue to be both relentless and innovative in their efforts to find gaps in your
organization's infrastructure and exploit them. While adversary motives vary, in
2020 financially motivated eCrime attacks far outnumber any others by volume —
representing 63% of CrowdStrike’s incident response engagements. eCrime adversaries
operate in both targeted and opportunistic ways, leaving no organization — regardless
of structure, size, industry or location — immune from attacks.

Countries

As with reports in years past, this report offers statistics and anecdotes that provide
unique visibility into the adversaries and trends the CrowdStrike Services team is
seeing from the front lines of working with organizations. Based on the numbers
derived from Services engagements, the following trends have been observed.

Companies

THE VOLUME AND VELOCITY OF FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED ATTACKS ARE STAGGERING

Sixty-three percent of incidents investigated in 2020 involved financially motivated
threat actors. These attacks ranged from ransomware targeting organizations of all
shapes and sizes, to unauthorized financial transactions in regionally focused SMBs,
all the way to large global enterprises. Among the financially motivated eCrime
attacks, 81% involved ransomware. The other 19% included eCrime attacks such as
point-of-sale intrusions, ecommerce website attacks, business email compromise
and cryptocurrency mining.

THREAT ACTORS ARE UPPING THEIR GAME WITH MALWARE THAT EVADES
TRADITIONAL ANTIVIRUS
As ransoms often continue to exceed seven figures and eCrime generally becomes
more lucrative, threat actors have additional capital and continue to mature their
organization to raise their game. What used to be smaller-scale business operations
have become big businesses generating exponential growth in revenue. With this,
threat actors are investing more into the development and deployment of techniques
that evade antivirus countermeasures. Antivirus solutions failed to provide protection
in 40% of the incidents CrowdStrike responded to in 2020 in which either malware
was undetected or a portion of the attack sequence was missed by antivirus tools.
And in 30% of incidents, antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR)
tools were not fully deployed, were improperly configured or were not supported
on the operating system. This data highlights why it is important to protect your
organization with next-generation antivirus solutions that leverage the cloud for
scalability and use modern techniques including machine learning and behavioral
detection to identify advanced threats. It also emphasizes the need to not just buy
a security product, but actually invest in ensuring comprehensive coverage in your
environment and proper configuration, tuning and integrating it into your security
operations program to mitigate even the most sophisticated attacks.

AT A GLANCE
Here are a few additional data points that reveal insights into the more successful
attack techniques, as well as some benchmarks for defenders.

Self-identification of a
breach is when an organization proactively identified
a breach without notification from a third party such
as law enforcement. While
victims self-identified a
breach in 69% of cases, in
14% the breach was identified due to the execution
of ransomware. Please
note this is the first year
that ransomware execution
is being tracked as its own
category.

Dwell time — the time an
adversary has unfettered

system — is down slightly
from 95 days in 2019 but
still remains quite high, at
79 days in 2020. Some
organizations are getting
faster at identifying a
breach within one week,
but CrowdStrike also
observed a slight increase
in the percentage of cases
with dwell times greater
than six months. It is worth
noting that the average
dwell time for ransomware
attacks was 45 days
in 2020, but in 26% of

INTRUSIONS SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS A ONE-TIME EVENT
Organizations that engage a professional services firm for incident response are
often eager to get the experience behind them and move on with business as usual.
Completion of an incident response, however, represents a critical opportunity to
drive improvements in people, process, technology and cybersecurity maturity that
should not be overlooked. Ignoring this opportunity to mature leaves organizations
exposed to the next intrusion, which is rarely far down the road.
CrowdStrike examined data from organizations that engaged incident response
services and later opted to engage CrowdStrike for fully managed endpoint protection
through the Falcon Complete service. Of these organizations, 68% encountered and
stopped another sophisticated intrusion attempt within the next 12 months.
It is tempting to think of intrusions as a lightning strike — a blinding flash that is
unlikely to strike the same place twice. Unfortunately, intrusion attempts are rarely
a one-time event. Organizations that do not take the opportunity to apply lessons
learned and to better prepare for their next encounter with an adversary may well
suffer attacks that result in additional data loss, ransom demands, extortion or other
monetary losses requiring costly legal fees, response services and perhaps even
future business interruption.

CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND RESPONSE CHANGES THE GAME
The key metric in effectively dealing with ongoing and recurring attacks is the time
it takes to remediate. Effective response and remediation of a threat first requires
detecting the threat, then performing the necessary investigation to scope and
understand it, and finally taking the needed actions to remediate the threat. Of
course, while the defenders are executing this playbook, adversaries are not
standing still. The fastest player wins this race.

INCIDENT RESPONSE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES FROM 2020 AND INSIGHTS THAT MATTER FOR 2021

CrowdStrike maintains a strong focus on acting quickly to stop a breach, clean up
malicious artifacts and help organizations get back to business quickly. CrowdStrike
encourages organizations to strive to meet the 1-10-60 rule, where security teams
demonstrate the ability to detect threats within the first minute of an intrusion,
investigate and understand the threat within 10 minutes, and contain and eradicate
the threat within 60 minutes.
In 2020, CrowdStrike introduced its Endpoint Recovery Services (ERS), specifically
designed to help customers bring their core business operations back quickly while
minimizing the risk of the attacker’s foothold within the environment. While traditional
incident response focuses on understanding an attacker's activity and determining
root cause, ERS focuses on quickly removing malware and other artifacts from
infected systems, blocking malicious activity and closing holes so the attackers
cannot get back in. CrowdStrike is seeing more organizations combine Incident
Response Services with ERS, which provides a powerful combination of detailed
root cause and impact (often demanded by cyber insurers and outside counsel)
along with fast and effective recovery. For more information, read this CrowdStrike
white paper, Intelligence-led Rapid Recovery.
Of course, the fastest way to handle intrusions is not to have one in the first place.
The most effective security teams handle intrusion attempts in near real time, as
they happen. At CrowdStrike, this is called “continuous monitoring and response”
— and this mindset shifts the balance of power strongly in favor of the defender.
Continuous monitoring and response requires a 24/7/365 security operations center
(SOC) team that is empowered with the advanced technology and mature processes
needed to quickly and effectively handle all kinds of cyber threats.
The CrowdStrike Falcon Complete team was created around this notion of
continuous monitoring and response, and the team has built and optimized its
operations to deliver security operations excellence for their global customer base.

Shifting SOC tactics from incident response to continuous monitoring and response
is key to stopping breaches in 2021 and beyond. CrowdStrike encourages all organizations to examine their own response times and look for opportunities to lower
these metrics, turning the tables on the adversaries.

OUTSIDE COUNSEL IS PLAYING A BIGGER ROLE IN THE INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCESS
As organizations become more mature and understand the risks associated with
breaches, they are careful that sensitive information about an incident does not fall
into the wrong hands or, if released, does not potentially increase the liability they
face. When dealing with a data breach, it is becoming best practice to engage the
incident response partner through outside counsel. When handling a cyber event,
work performed in order to gather information for the purpose of assisting an
attorney in rendering legal advice may be protected under attorney-client privilege
and/or work product doctrine, preventing it from being open to discovery in a
lawsuit. Attorney-client privilege is designed to protect confidential communication
between attorneys and their clients, and the work product doctrine precludes
disclosure of materials created at the direction of counsel specifically in preparation
for litigation.
In 2020, outside counsel engaged CrowdStrike Services to advise its clients in 49%
of investigations. This trend has increased globally and will likely continue over the
next several years. While the same legal constructs do not exist in every country,
multinational organizations that conduct business in the United States or other
jurisdictions may want to consult outside legal counsel at the outset of an incident
response to determine how best to engage an investigation firm.
Preserving attorney-client privilege and work product protections during incident
response and recovery engagements is no small task. If you are interested in
understanding more about engaging CrowdStrike Services through outside counsel
for your next cyber investigation and incident recovery, read this paper developed
by CrowdStrike Services in conjunction with representatives from an IT technical
services firm and a forensic accounting firm: Intelligence-led Rapid Recovery.

As CrowdStrike’s teams of experts engage with clients around the world to contain
and eradicate threats and drive more mature cybersecurity practices, patterns
emerge. In addition to the findings already discussed, the CrowdStrike Services
team identified a number of key themes from the work performed across all
customer engagements over the past year. This next section dives deep into the top
six key themes from 2020.

THEME 1: SECURITY IN SWEATPANTS: HOW WIDESPREAD
REMOTE WORK CHANGES SECURITY
The year 2020 brought quick and decisive digital transformations across industries
in response to remote work requirements. During this “Great Pivot,” many
organizations effectively turned their networks inside out to allow employees to
work from anywhere. This pivot also accelerated both the ongoing adoption of
cloud technologies and the organizational support for hybrid working environments.
Some organizations accomplished several years’ worth of digital transformation in a
matter of weeks. As a result, CrowdStrike saw more organizations seeking to move
away from traditional on-premises cybersecurity solutions and toward cloud-centric
architectures. For these organizations especially, identity management and workload
security — including endpoints, cloud workloads, mobile devices, etc. — are crucially
important.

NETWORKS TURNED INSIDE OUT
The operational and architectural pivot to a work-from-anywhere model occurred
under extreme time and operational pressures, resulting in significant changes to
operations and even network configurations themselves. Suddenly, organizational
perimeters dramatically changed as employees began accessing network
resources from new locations, and in some cases, with new devices. This pivot also
forced organizations to change some of their own operations. For instance, many
companies that did not previously permit remote access to corporate networks, like
virtual private networks (VPNs), suddenly found that they needed to enable these
technologies to support a fully remote workforce.

INCIDENT RESPONSE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES FROM 2020 AND INSIGHTS THAT MATTER FOR 2021

17

Despite the best efforts of the technology teams that implemented these changes,
attackers have consistently capitalized on new opportunities arising from security
gaps or unintentional configuration errors. In 2020, CrowdStrike Services
responded to multiple cases in which the transition to remote operations resulted in
unauthorized remote access to internal systems. In some of these cases, companies
had adjusted configurations on corporate laptops to allow expanded use of VPN and
RDP, but did not implement best practices to restrict activity to approved internal IP
addresses or require the use of multifactor authentication.

TARGETS NEW AND OLD

Attackers have
consistently capitalized
on new opportunities
arising from security
gaps or unintentional
configuration errors.

Individual users remain a significant target of opportunity for attackers seeking to
infiltrate organizations. However, the move to “work from anywhere” has expanded
the potential methods that attackers can employ to exploit users. CrowdStrike
continues to observe attackers leveraging remote access credentials to gain access
to target environments. Conversely, the pivot to remote work highlights the difficulty
that many security teams face in administering and patching systems when users
are not required to connect to the domain with a VPN.
Meanwhile, attackers also continue to exploit vulnerabilities that existed before
widespread remote work. Organizations that lack robust system configuration
controls have faced challenges in applying patches, deploying security updates and
performing standard maintenance activities for devices. CrowdStrike has worked
with organizations that experienced attacks stemming from initial access gained
through vulnerabilities in publicly exposed systems and applications.

SECURITY AFTER THE GREAT PIVOT
In this work-from-anywhere landscape, security teams must remain vigilant in
performing the fundamentals of cybersecurity. Organizations that migrate to cloudcentric architectures must become more focused on implementing effective identityand device-based access controls, steering access controls toward a posture of
Zero Trust. All employees who participate in information security — from leadership
to supporting team members — must clearly understand their roles and be ready
to perform them, especially under these high-stakes conditions as organizations
continue to transition to work from anywhere.
CrowdStrike recommends the following practices:
Survey your battlefield. For security teams operating in this new
environment, visibility and speed are critical for blocking attackers that
have the capability and intent to steal data and disrupt operations. As
organizations increasingly support work-from-anywhere operations, security
teams must establish consistent visibility into on-premises and cloud
environments and must proactively address potential vulnerabilities before
they can be leveraged by attackers.

INCIDENT RESPONSE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES FROM 2020 AND INSIGHTS THAT MATTER FOR 2021

Local and cloud-hosted applications should be consistently patched,
and business-critical applications should be carefully monitored and
maintained.
Security teams should reinforce their understanding of externally facing
devices by performing routine vulnerability and asset management scans.
All perimeter devices — including network DMZs, jump servers, and
web and email servers — should be treated as high-risk systems and
subjected to security reviews equivalent to critical systems on the
network.
Security and infrastructure teams should ensure that externally facing
systems are hardened by closing unnecessary ports and network
services, applying strict firewall policies and properly segmenting
networks.
Access control policies should be applied and security teams should
monitor for unauthorized attempts to access networks, such as through
brute-force vulnerability exploitation or similar techniques.
Security teams should be able to readily discover cloud assets, detect
misconfigurations and quickly perform remediation in their cloud
environments.
Establish Zero Trust controls for critical systems and data. CrowdStrike
continues to observe attackers focusing their attention on identitybased attacks, with diverse adversaries leveraging compromised or weak
credentials to evade detection and access “crown jewels” and critical
systems. The concept of Zero Trust security addresses the problem of
access exploitation by continuously vetting access requests to locally
or cloud-hosted assets. While implementing Zero Trust may sound like a
daunting task, focusing on the fundamentals and closing the biggest gaps
in your environment with Zero Trust principles have the most immediate
impact and can be achieved in a short amount of time. Organizations can
achieve quick time-to-value with Zero Trust by focusing on privileged or
over-privileged accounts, building a baseline of behavior based on access,
and putting in prevention or conditional access in high-risk authentication
scenarios (e.g., RDP access to Domain Controller, and service account
RDP). Zero Trust may also include installing multifactor authentication on
all systems that hold sensitive data or support key operations, enforcing
least-privilege access on sensitive systems, and reducing the size of
network zones through micro-segmentation. Zero Trust security typically
also involves real-time monitoring, both of potential misuse of sensitive
credentials and of suspicious system or data access patterns.
Don’t forget about controlling access and data within your cloud
environments. Organizations that leverage cloud or hybrid environments
should control and monitor access to these environments through a cloud
access security broker (CASB). Regardless of network architecture,
organizations should provide their security teams with tools to monitor
both user access patterns and the movement of sensitive data. Ultimately,

organizations should reevaluate all default access controls, removing
trusted sources and requiring all connections to be authenticated,
authorized and encrypted.

variants have multiplied,
evolved and become

their proliferation going

Test your operations with tailored exercises. Even if an organization’s
move to “work from anywhere” has been relatively smooth, the pivot has
likely introduced subtle but significant changes to baseline security posture
and response processes. For many companies, long-held assumptions
about security processes and workflows may no longer be true — at
least not in the way they were once understood. CrowdStrike has seen
organizations gain significant value through remote exercises. Remotely
hosted red team/blue team exercises highlight new operational challenges
— and opportunities — for SOC teams responding to red team attacks.
Remote tabletop exercises provide both technical and management teams
with crucial opportunities to rehearse incident response activities while
all participants — including executives — are limited to virtual interactions.
The lessons learned through these proactive engagements pay significant
dividends by keeping incident response and management teams alert
to evolving threats, nimble in their response, and savvy regarding how
organizational processes should evolve to meet current needs.

THEME 2: RANSOMWARE ACTORS EVOLVE THEIR
OPERATIONS
In 2020, CrowdStrike Services observed the continued evolution and proliferation
of eCrime adversaries engaging in big game hunting (BGH) ransomware techniques.
BGH was first observed by CrowdStrike in 2016 with the introduction of BOSS
SPIDER’s Samas (aka SamSam) ransomware. In the years that followed, BGH
ransomware variants have multiplied, evolved and become more sophisticated,
with their proliferation going virtually unimpeded by legacy endpoint security tools.
The year 2020 was marked by the trend continuing at an accelerated rate. The
advancements by eCrime actors include refinement and application of high-pressure
extortion tactics on victim organizations and the sharing or copying of new techniques
among different ransomware groups, in addition to a marked increase in the number of
ransomware variants. These advancements all but ensure that ransomware will remain
a popular method for eCrime actors to monetize breaches in the foreseeable future.

RANSOMWARE ACTORS INCREASE PRESSURE
CrowdStrike Services observed eCrime adversaries utilizing various techniques to
increase pressure on victim organizations to pay their extortion. While in previous
years ransomware eCrime adversaries were rarely observed exfiltrating data, 2020
witnessed a widespread adoption of ransomware with data-leak extortion tactics
among multiple eCrime groups. This method involves both encrypting a victim
organization’s environment and also exfiltrating data with the threat to leak it if
the extortion demand is not paid. This tactic was initially observed by CrowdStrike

Intelligence with OUTLAW SPIDER in May 2019. However, it was not until November
2019, when TWISTED SPIDER adopted this technique, that it became a catalyst
for multiple other eCrime actors, many of which have created dedicated leak sites
to threaten exfiltration and distribute data. CrowdStrike Intelligence performed
research on known dedicated leak sites beginning in November 2019. The results of
this analysis depict growth throughout 2020 in terms of the number of leak sites and
the number of victim entities with data published on the leak sites.

In engagements involving eCrime adversaries that use ransomware with data-leak
extortion, CrowdStrike Services is regularly asked to perform incident response
investigations to assist stakeholders by identifying data that was accessed and
exfiltrated by threat actors. Frequently, CrowdStrike Services is able to identify the data
exfiltrated prior to publication by the eCrime adversary, thereby giving stakeholders an
opportunity to prepare.
Not only has the number of eCrime dedicated leak sites grown, threat actors have also
become more sophisticated in their methods of leaking the data. In general, eCrime
adversaries will leak exfiltrated data slowly, saving what they perceive to be the most
sensitive data for last in an effort to increase pressure on the victim organization to

CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES CYBER FRONT LINES REPORT
INCIDENT RESPONSE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES FROM 2020 AND INSIGHTS THAT MATTER FOR 2021

21

pay the extortion, rather than posting all of the exfiltrated data at once. PINCHY
SPIDER’s dedicated leak site frequently holds auctions to sell exfiltrated data.
Others, such as DOPPEL SPIDER’s leak site, utilize a countdown timer that triggers
an increase in the ransom demand upon each expiration. CARBON SPIDER’s
leak site automatically releases data on a pre-set timer, with the least sensitive
data leaked first and the most sensitive leaked last. There are also significant
differences in the amount of data exfiltrated by threat actors. CrowdStrike Services
has observed DOPPEL SPIDER frequently exfiltrating only tens of gigabytes,
while others — such as TRAVELING SPIDER and affiliates associated with Nemty
X ransomware — exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of data or more from victim
organizations.
In addition to ransomware with data-leak extortion, CrowdStrike Services has
identified additional tactics by eCrime adversaries to increase pressure on the
victim to pay the ransom. During several recent incidents, the eCrime adversaries,
after deploying ransomware to the victim organization’s environment, have utilized
stolen credentials to gain access to the victim organization’s email instance to
send extortion-related emails to users demanding payment to prevent exfiltrated
data from being leaked. In other instances, the eCrime adversaries have called and
harassed employees of a victim organization following ransomware deployment.
Finally, CrowdStrike also observed threat actors increase pressure for payment with
credible threats of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks if ransom payment is
not received.

ECRIME ADVERSARIES COLLABORATE
CrowdStrike has observed formal collaboration among eCrime adversaries as well
as shared tactics. In June 2020, the self-named “Maze Cartel” was created when
TWISTED SPIDER, VIKING SPIDER and the operators of LockBit ransomware
entered into an apparent collaborative business arrangement. After this occurred,
leaks associated with VIKING SPIDER’s Ragnar Locker began appearing on
TWISTED SPIDER’s dedicated leak site and Maze ransomware began deploying
ransomware using common virtualization software, a tactic originally pioneered by
VIKING SPIDER.
In addition to formal collaboration, CrowdStrike Services has observed new tactics
used and spread among eCrime actors. One such tactic is the development and
deployment of an ELF ransomware binary that can be deployed to ESXi hosts for
the purpose of encrypting virtual systems. This tactic was initially observed being
used by SPRITE SPIDER’s Defray777 ransomware in August 2020 and was quickly
adopted by CARBON SPIDER, which utilized a similar tactic weeks later. In addition,
multiple eCrime adversaries share common exfiltration techniques. CrowdStrike has
observed multiple eCrime adversaries exfiltrating data through MegaSync as well as
Rclone, an open-source computer program.

WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT
Over the last several years, eCrime adversaries that engage in BGH ransomware
have advanced rapidly in terms of their capabilities and sophistication. It is
reasonable to expect that this trend will continue at an accelerated rate with the
same goal in mind — to apply as much pressure as possible to organizations to pay
ever-larger extortion demands. CrowdStrike expects that eCrime adversaries will
continue to refine their data-leak extortion ransomware tactics, develop increasingly
sophisticated exfiltration tooling that can be deployed widely, and automate data
exfiltration by searching for, identifying and exfiltrating sensitive data by keyword.

Ransomware with
data extortion remains
a lucrative tactic for
eCrime adversaries to
monetize their presence
in a victim organization's
network.

Lastly, CrowdStrike expects eCrime adversaries to continue pursuing targets of
opportunity. Frequently, these are SMBs that rely heavily on legacy antivirus to
protect them, but many large organizations are being hit frequently, as threat actors
see a higher return on investment when targeting an organization that may have
stronger defenses but is also likely to pay a higher ransom demand.

WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Why is ransomware so prevalent in 2020? In short, ransomware with data extortion
remains a lucrative tactic for eCrime adversaries to monetize their presence in
a victim organization’s network. Fueled by increasingly larger ransom demands,
eCrime adversaries continue to develop tactics and tools that allow them to slip
past legacy antivirus virtually unnoticed. Following a ransomware incident, many
organizations may find that they do not have adequate backups, or that their
backups became encrypted, and they have few options but to pay the ransom. In
addition, some cyber insurance companies, during cost-benefit analysis, may find
that paying the ransom is a less costly option than rebuilding systems and incurring
credit monitoring and legal fees due to the disclosure of regulated data by an
eCrime adversary.
CrowdStrike recommends the following practices:
Build a bulletproof backup strategy. When it comes to ransomware, how
you’ve configured your backups is critical. Attackers often delete backups
before deploying ransomware so you are more inclined to pay. Some
steps to consider include purchasing an immutable backup solution, using
separate non-domain accounts with multifactor authentication to administer
your backup solution, retaining multiple copies of data on different media
with one of them being off-site, keeping at least one copy of your backups
offline or on an otherwise air-gapped network, and closely monitoring your
backup solution for evidence of data exfiltration, whether it’s on-premises or
in the cloud. eCrime adversaries have publicly boasted about utilizing cloud
backups for data exfiltration, and CrowdStrike recommends taking steps
to prevent threat actors from accessing cloud backup infrastructure in the
event of a compromise. This can involve using non-domain accounts for
cloud management and multifactor authentication.

CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES CYBER FRONT LINES REPORT
INCIDENT RESPONSE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES FROM 2020 AND INSIGHTS THAT MATTER FOR 2021

24

 se multifactor authentication. Organizations can improve their security
U
posture by enabling multifactor authentication on all public-facing employee
services and portals as well as restricting internet-facing protocols such as
RDP and Server Message Block. This will inhibit unauthorized access to the
organization’s environment.
Implement next-generation endpoint protection. Organizations can
improve their security posture by utilizing advanced endpoint protection
across their environment. The agent should leverage machine learning to
identify anomalies and perform heuristic analysis, in addition to conducting
antivirus and anti-malware activities in real time. The agent should be
capable of detection and prevention, allow for remote network containment
of assets pending investigation and/or remediation, and detect unmanaged
assets within the corporate environment.
Utilize a privileged account management solution. Organizations
can improve their security posture by implementing privileged account
management (PAM) that securely containerizes and rotates credentials
of privileged accounts such as local or domain administrators, service
accounts and database accounts. The PAM should rotate credentials no
longer than every eight hours and be capable of alerting if credential reuse
is attempted after their expiration, thereby inhibiting threat actor activity.
Know when to ask for help. In some instances, organizations become
aware of threat actor activity within their environment but may lack the
visibility to address the problem or the right intelligence to understand the
nature of the threat. Getting educated about the latest threats and knowing
when to ask for help by activating an incident response team or retainer,
such as those offered by CrowdStrike Services, may allow for detection
and remediation before the threat actor is able to deploy ransomware or
exfiltrate data from the environment.

THEME 3: ADVERSARIES HAVE THEIR HEADS IN
THE CLOUD
In many organizations, the adoption of cloud infrastructure had happened to some
degree prior to the global pandemic. While the pandemic certainly accelerated the
move to the cloud for many organizations, with some electing to go all-in on cloud,
other organizations continue to test the waters and gradually move certain services
or capabilities into various cloud platforms. CrowdStrike is even seeing some
early cloud adopters moving from legacy cloud deployments to new architectures
in the hope of gaining improvements in scalability, maintenance and security. No
matter where you are in your cloud journey, managing the security posture of cloud
environments can play a critical role in preventing a breach.

CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES CYBER FRONT LINES REPORT

25

INCIDENT RESPONSE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES FROM 2020 AND INSIGHTS THAT MATTER FOR 2021

One trend CrowdStrike saw in 2020 involved threat actors targeting cloud
infrastructure slated for retirement or simply neglected for various reasons.
This vulnerability likely stemmed from infrastructure no longer receiving security
configuration updates and regular maintenance. Unfortunately, security controls
like monitoring, expanded logging, security architecture/planning and posture
remediation no longer occurred in these environments.
Unfortunately, CrowdStrike encountered cases where neglected cloud infrastructure
still contained critical business data and systems. As such, attacks led to sensitive
data leaks requiring costly investigation and reporting obligations. Additionally, some
attacks on abandoned cloud environments resulted in impactful service outages,
since they still provided critical services that hadn’t been fully transitioned to new
infrastructure. Moreover, the triage, containment and recovery from the incident
in these environments had a tremendous negative impact on some organizations
as these activities disrupted the release of a key feature launch in one case and
delayed M&A activities in another.
Not only did the Services team see cloud infrastructure as a target of attacks in
2020, the cloud also served as a vehicle to launch attacks. Over the past year, threat
actors leveraged common cloud services, like Microsoft Azure, and data storage
syncing services, like MEGA, to exfiltrate data and proxy network traffic. A lack of
outbound restrictions coupled with a lack of workload protection enabled threat
actors to interact with local services over proxies to IP addresses in the cloud.
This gave attackers additional time to interrogate systems and exfiltrate data from
services ranging from partner-operated web-based APIs to databases to custom
network services — all while appearing to originate from inside the victim’s network
and barely leaving a trace on local file systems.

WHAT CAN I DO TO PROTECT MY CLOUD ENVIRONMENT?
The cloud introduces new wrinkles to proper protection that don’t all translate exactly
from a traditional on-premises data center model. Security teams should keep the
following firmly in mind as they strive to remain grounded in best practices.
Enable runtime protection and obtain real-time visibility. You can’t protect
what you don’t have visibility into — even if you have plans to decommission
the infrastructure. Central to securing your cloud infrastructure to prevent
a breach is runtime protection and visibility provided by cloud workload
protection (CWP). It remains critical to protect your workloads with nextgeneration endpoint protection, including servers, workstations and mobile
devices, regardless of whether they reside in an on-premises data center or
virtual cluster, or hosted in the cloud.
 liminate configuration errors. The most common root cause of cloud
E
intrusions continues to be human errors and omissions introduced during
common administrative activities. It’s important to set up new infrastructure
with default patterns that make secure operations easy to adopt. One way
to do this is to use a cloud account factory to create new sub-accounts and
subscriptions easily. This strategy ensures that new accounts are set up in a
predictable manner, eliminating common sources of human error. Also, make
sure to set up roles and network security groups that keep developers and
operators from needing to build their own security profiles and accidentally
doing it poorly.
Leverage a cloud security posture management (CSPM) solution. Ensure
your cloud account factory includes enabling detailed logging and a CSPM
— like CrowdStrike’s Falcon Horizon™ — with alerting to responsible parties
including cloud operations and SOC teams. Actively seek out unmanaged
cloud subscriptions, and when found, don’t assume it's managed by someone
else. Instead, ensure that responsible parties are identified and motivated
to either decommission any shadow IT cloud environments or bring them
under full management along with your CSPM. Then use your CSPM
on all infrastructure up until the day the account or subscription is fully
decommissioned to ensure that operations teams have continuous visibility.

THEME 4: WATCH FOR WEAKNESSES WITH PUBLICFACING APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES
In order for state-sponsored or criminally motivated adversaries to launch an attack,
they must gain initial access to an environment. In 2020, CrowdStrike Services
observed adversaries exploiting public-facing applications in 30% of investigated
cases in order to gain initial access. The Services team witnessed adversaries
firsthand as they capitalized on new vulnerabilities, often within 24 to 48 hours after
security researchers publicly released proof-of-concept (POC) exploits.

INCIDENT RESPONSE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES FROM 2020 AND INSIGHTS THAT MATTER FOR 2021

While attackers have always targeted internet-facing infrastructure, the volume of
incidents that began this way in 2020 represents a shift in the threat landscape.
Several factors likely fueled this shift, but three deserve particular attention.
The large number of published vulnerabilities: At the time of this
writing, 2020 is on track to see approximately 19,000 newly published
vulnerabilities, according to the National Vulnerability Database —
representing the most vulnerabilities ever published in a single year, up
nearly 9% from 2019.

There was an acceleration and shift toward businesses offering more
external services as they pivoted to remote work models.
It’s important to note that application vulnerabilities are not the only way attackers
gain initial access via publicly facing applications. In fact, attackers gained initial
access via remote login services exposed to the internet and with single-factor
authentication in 14% of the incidents investigated. Adversaries often achieved
this access via brute-force, password-spraying, or credential-stuffing attacks, or
previously compromised credentials likely purchased on dark web forums.
The most common exploits across all of the investigated incidents targeted remote
code execution vulnerabilities in Citrix ADC/NetScaler appliances and Microsoft
SharePoint, as well as arbitrary read/write vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN and
Telerik UI for ASP.NET. Other less common public-facing applications exploited
include Microsoft Exchange, Zoho ManageEngine and ConnectWise. The top five
most common public-facing application vulnerabilities or remote external services
that CrowdStrike observed being exploited for initial access represent 27% of all
incident response engagements that CrowdStrike conducted in 2020.

28

CrowdStrike observed that when the adversary gained initial access by exploiting
a public-facing application or using valid accounts on remote external services, the
attack resulted in ransomware 36% of the time. Moreover, 16% of the time, these
same initial access techniques led to a breach of sensitive data such as intellectual
property, personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information
(PHI) or payment card information (PCI). Perimeter-facing vulnerabilities along
with applications that are not protected by multifactor authentication clearly bring
significant financial impacts to businesses — system and network downtime was
also routinely observed.

WHAT CAN BE DONE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON DEFENSES FOR PUBLIC-FACING
APPLICATIONS?
In order to protect internet-facing applications, CrowdStrike recommends implementing the following best practices to mitigate adversaries obtaining initial access
via public-facing applications or external remote services.
Inventory your public-facing applications, services and systems.
Organizations should have a complete inventory and understanding of
their externally facing applications and remote access services, including
the software and versions running on them. They should incorporate this
inventory into their asset management and vulnerability management
processes. It’s impossible to defend systems you don’t know are there.
Patch vulnerable web applications. Applications and operating systems
should be kept up-to-date by installing all vendor-released patches. In
situations where proof-of-concept exploits have been publicly released but
vendor patches are not yet available, vendor mitigation steps should be
implemented.
 erform web application penetration tests. Organizations should have
P
a third party conduct web application penetration tests to identify and fix
vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that an attacker could exploit to gain
access.
 nforce multifactor authentication on public-facing applications
E
and services, such as RDP and VPNs. Single-factor, password-based
authentication is vulnerable to brute-force, password-spraying and credentialstuffing attacks. Multifactor authentication increases attacker complexity and
increases the likelihood of detection before a successful attack.
 estrict systems with remote login services such as RDP and Secure
R
Shell (SSH) exposed to the internet. Allowing remote connections from all
external IP addresses greatly increases the chance of system compromise.
Systems that require external-facing remote login for business purposes
should be restricted based on source IP address. Systems that do not
require external-facing remote login for business purposes should have the
service disabled.

THEME 5: STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES LEAVE
SMALLER FOOTPRINTS
The CrowdStrike Services team continued to respond to state-sponsored adversary
intrusions at organizations throughout 2020. While many organizations think they
may not be a target of state-sponsored adversaries, some should think again. In
2020, CrowdStrike saw state-sponsored adversaries target organizations ranging
from 500 to 50,000+ endpoints across 10 industries. This section highlights key
trends observed to be employed by nation-state adversaries and also provides
considerations for preventing and responding to nation-state adversaries.

CrowdStrike Services
saw state-sponsored
adversaries target
organizations ranging
from 500 to 50,000+
endpoints across 10
industries.

STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES EMPLOYED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF N-DAY
VULNERABILITY EXPLOITS
In 2020, the CrowdStrike Services team observed state-sponsored actors achieving
access to target networks through supply chain attacks, physical access, wateringhole attacks, spear-phishing and via vulnerable public-facing applications. CrowdStrike
Services observed heavy use of known vulnerabilities (“N-days”) to compromise
externally facing applications. Notably, CrowdStrike Services identified that nationstate actors leveraged the use of Pulse Secure VPN, Citrix ADC and Zoho Desktop
Central vulnerabilities in 2020. As mentioned, the exploitation of these vulnerabilities
often came 24 to 48 hours after the release of POC code through open-source
repositories, demonstrating significant capabilities for rapid development.

STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES PUT A BULLSEYE ON CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS
In 2020, CrowdStrike Services increasingly responded to incidents in which nationstate adversaries also targeted and compromised cloud infrastructure. In many
of these cases, the actors were able to gain access to the environment either
through credential theft in traditional on-premises systems or through improperly
configured services. In addition, the Services team responded to incidents where
top commercial cloud providers were used as initial staging points to further blend in
with legitimate traffic.
In the previous edition of this report, the Services team noted that exposed cloud
application programming interface (API) keys with minimal restrictions and often a
lack of additional auditing represented the bulk of intrusion cases involving cloud
infrastructure as a service (IaaS). In 2020, the Services team identified that in a
subset of incidents, the adversaries compromised the control plane of the tenant
and performed actions-on-objectives tasks directly through the tenant console. The
team also observed them taking advantage of single-factor authentication access
to IaaS consoles and leveraging Microsoft Azure to push Cobalt Strike beacons via
PowerShell. During these incidents, preconfigured logging and enhanced auditing of
individual service components played a critical role in providing the Services team
with the ability to track and contain adversary actions.

30

STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES LEVERAGED INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED
ATTACK TECHNIQUES WHILE LEAVING EXTREMELY SMALL FOOTPRINTS
State-sponsored adversaries continue to blend in by using “living off the land”
(LOTL) techniques both within traditional enterprise environments and in the cloud,
as well as using custom implants that leave minimal artifacts for traditional forensic
analysis. In 2020, delivery of more sophisticated implants by nation-state actors
— often leveraging memory- and modular-based implants — typically occurred
through watering-hole attacks or supply-chain compromise. In a subset of these
cases, the actors leveraged LOTL techniques and commodity toolsets (e.g., certutil,
msbuild, bits, Cobalt Strike, generic webshells, etc.), while others leveraged custom
and some previously unknown implants to maintain persistence. Commonly, the
identified implants leveraged a multi-stage framework in which a minimal footprint
was maintained on the disk through a persistent loader. The implants were activated
through preconfigured command-and-control channels, and subsequent payloads
were retrieved in a modular fashion that were loaded only in memory for execution
to carry out their specific task.
These sophisticated techniques are one of the reasons why state-sponsored
adversaries persist in networks much longer than average. Although the overall
dwell time for incidents investigated by CrowdStrike Services decreased in 2020
compared to 2019 (from 95 days to 79 days), state-sponsored adversary dwell time
significantly exceeded the overall average dwell time by a factor of nearly 10 — just
under two years. That means while the average attacker spent two to three months
in a network before discovery, the average state-sponsored threat actor/group spent
nearly two years in a network prior to discovery.
When state-sponsored threats were identified, the availability of volatile evidence
such as memory dumps and full network packet captures played a crucial role in
enabling the CrowdStrike team to perform forensic analysis of systems affected by
the identified implants. Organizations with the visibility and infrastructure in place to
capture necessary telemetry during active operation periods played a critical role in
enabling the Services team to successfully carry out the investigation and assist the
organization in answering key questions related to the incident.

PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO STATE-SPONSORED INTRUSIONS
CrowdStrike recommends the following practices when defending against nationstate threat actors:
Establish strong IT hygiene with an asset inventory and consistent
vulnerability management. Inventorying and patching external
infrastructure on a regular basis increases the difficulty of initial access
for nation-state actors. Creating contingency plans for applications that
cannot be immediately patched — such as increased monitoring, access
restrictions and backup applications — can help organizations reduce their
risk in situations where applications do not have patches available.

 rotect your cloud infrastructure and workloads. Critical applications
P
and data are being moved to the cloud, and while organizations are
getting better at protecting their cloud environments, they continue to
strategically assess their security posture in traditional ways. Traditional
tabletop assessments and red team engagements are no longer enough.
Organizations must adopt a cloud-focused assessment strategy to keep up
with the changing threat landscape. Cloud security assessment and cloudfocused tabletop assessments can identify gaps in cloud protections and
logging. Additionally, the CrowdStrike Falcon Horizon CSPM module can
help organizations manage the security of their cloud workloads.
 stablish a plan for a coordinated remediation event (CRE). With nationE
state actors maintaining a longer dwell time than their eCrime counterparts,
organizations must learn to manage longer-term incidents. Executing
containment actions too quickly can result in the threat actor changing
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). And, containment actions can
sometimes be impactful to a network, causing downtime or signaling your
intent prior to the action being taken. A CRE is a detailed procedure for
removing a threat actor from the network in one fell swoop. Implementing a
CRE plan prior to an incident can help organizations reduce the likelihood of
re-compromise when defending against nation-state threat actors.
Develop an ongoing relationship with law enforcement agencies. It is
good to have a relationship with law enforcement prior to a breach. While
some organizations may be wary of involving multiple external parties in an
investigation, having a relationship with law enforcement can be a valuable
tool during an investigation. A few things that law enforcement relationships
may offer:
Intelligence on threat actor groups
Guidance on ransom payments
Tracing of unauthorized payments

THEME 6: AFTER THE BREACH: MAKING IMPROVEMENTS
TO STOP THE NEXT BREACH
Over the years, there have been multiple permutations of the cybersecurity incident
response lifecycle, but no matter how that model evolves, two things remain constant:
It starts with preparation and ends with applying lessons learned. These parts of the
process don’t typically garner much attention — after all, the exciting stuff is what
happens in between. In 2020, however, CrowdStrike Services saw a growing number
of organizations focusing intently on the post-incident period. The Services team also
saw them expand the scope of this process, focusing less narrowly on the specifics of
the incident and broadening the process to drive more holistic change.

"Never let a good crisis
go to waste."

OPPORTUNITY FROM CRISIS
A significant cyber breach can be devastating to an organization, and experiencing a
second breach on the heels of the first is far more catastrophic. This is why business
leaders always ask, “What are we doing to keep this from happening again?” It’s a
pivotal question, especially for a security team whose performance is likely under
a microscope. Mishandle it and you may never regain your leaders’ confidence.
Answer it well, and you will not only win back their trust but also lay the foundation
for a stronger security program moving forward.
Providing a good answer requires expansive thinking, and perhaps an embrace of
the aphorism, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” In the wake of a major incident,
cybersecurity awareness is high, risk tolerance is low, and past assumptions about
operational and budgetary constraints are subject to change. While it is important to
address the root causes of the incident that occurred, it is a mistake to stop there.
The next incident is unlikely to exactly mirror the last one, and any improvement plan
should not only address the specific causes of the last incident but also weed out
the seeds of the next one.

POST-INCIDENT PLANNING
Any holistic response process is going to be a marathon, not a sprint — and the
course of that marathon will be different for each organization. In most cases, the
following steps are certainly worth considering:
Expedite recovery. Before any plans for improvement can begin, it is
essential to secure and restore the environment quickly. Third-party
assistance — such as CrowdStrike’s Endpoint Recovery Services — can
streamline the containment, remediation and recovery phases of an incident
using more streamlined and surgical workflows versus the traditional
approach of rebuilding IT environments. This approach allows the business
to get back to work more rapidly and less expensively, and allows the
security team to train its focus on making improvements.

Test new controls. Many remediation plans involve implementing new
controls, such as implementing multifactor authentication, updating firewall
rules, changing group policy configurations or patching a key vulnerability.
Depending on the nature of the new controls, it may be necessary to
perform technical tests to verify they are working as intended.
Conduct a lessons-learned process. This is the traditional post-incident
review, which focuses on identifying and understanding the root causes
of the incident as well as understanding what went well and what did not
during the response. Although it is an indispensable part of the response
lifecycle, it is by definition focused on the last battle and may or may not
provide useful insights for fighting the next one.
 ecure executive buy-in. In the wake of a major incident, the security team
S
is going to be subject to additional scrutiny. Clear, open communication with
leadership is critical to restoring their trust in a security program. Beyond
explaining “What happened?” to leadership, security leaders will be expected
to explain “How will we prevent future incidents?” as well as “How do we know
that we’re taking the right approach?” Executives should be briefed on the way
forward and updated at key points along that journey. By outlining a plan that
includes the steps below, the security team can give executives confidence
that security will take a broad, open-minded approach to making improvements.
It may also help to bring in third-party experts to attest to this approach and
assure executives that the path forward you have charted is the right one.
 erform a technical assessment. The goal of a technical assessment
P
should be to identify and understand factors about your organization’s
network that could make future incidents more or less likely. It is not a
penetration test — presumably a threat actor just succeeded at that — but
it may take different forms depending on the nature of the incident and
investigation that occurred. For instance, if the investigation was confined
to a specific network segment or specific business unit, an enterprise-wide
compromise assessment can give confidence that the attacker did not
move into parts of the environment that were beyond the scope of the initial
investigation. If the prior investigation was thorough, consider an IT hygiene
assessment to identify weak passwords, Active Directory configurations or
missed patches that could open the door to the next attacker.
Perform a programmatic assessment. The post-incident period is the
perfect time to evaluate a security program from top to bottom — and
consider the people, processes and technologies. The just-completed
incident exposed some weaknesses but probably not all of them — and
possibly not the most significant ones. A full assessment will help provide an
objective understanding of the security program’s current maturity, facilitate
conversations about where it ought to be and prioritize which improvements
to make first. It provides the prerequisite understanding before you can
effectively answer “What are we doing to keep this from happening again?”
 evelop a roadmap. The steps above are all likely to identify things your orD
ganization can do to be more secure. Your roadmap should reflect which of

those changes you are going to prioritize and your timelines for completing
them. It’s important to take a risk-informed approach, prioritizing quick wins
to show progress while also investing in the improvements that are going to
most significantly reduce your risk — even if they’re longer-term efforts.
Execute with accountability. Depending on the nature of the changes
an organization needs to make, executing on its roadmap may take years.
These long, complex improvement plans require careful management
and checkpoints along the way to ensure everything remains on course.
Strong project management can help track milestones and ensure plans
stay on schedule. It may also be necessary to seek outside guidance,
both to ensure that the improvements you’re making are addressing the
risks they’re meant to and also to consider whether changes in the threat
landscape merit a realignment of priorities.
Test your progress. Once specific projects are completed, run tests
to ensure they are working. Use penetration tests to validate technical
controls, and run exercises to test new processes.

PREPARING FOR THE NEXT BATTLE
In some respects, the visual of the incident response lifecycle does security teams a
disservice. The notion of a “cycle” implies a circular path, where you return to where
you were before.

Taking a more expansive approach to the post-incident review process gives
security teams another path. Rather than circling back to the beginning, the aim
is to arrive back at the pre-incident phase better equipped to stop incidents from
occurring and respond effectively to those that do. The goal is not to eliminate
security incidents — it would be a grave mistake to promise such a thing to leaders
who ask about stopping the next one. The goal is to turn that cycle into an upward
spiral, where future incidents are less frequent and less severe. At the apex of that
spiral is the continuous monitoring and response process, where new threats are
identified and remediated in near real time.
