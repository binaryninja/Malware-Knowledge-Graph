CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

While there is considerable overlap between the observed TTPs of
RedDelta and the threat activity group publicly referred to as Mustang
Panda (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT and HoneyMyte), there are
a few notable distinctions which lead us to designate this activity as
RedDelta:
The version of PlugX used by RedDelta in this campaign uses
a different C2 traffic encryption method and has a different
configuration encryption mechanism than traditional PlugX.
The malware infection chain employed in this campaign has not been
publicly reported as used by Mustang Panda.
In addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic Church,
Insikt Group also identified RedDelta targeting law enforcement and
government entities in India and a government organization in Indonesia.

Insikt Group® researchers used proprietary Recorded Future Network Traffic
Analysis and RAT controller detections, along with common analytical techniques, to
identify and profile a cyberespionage campaign attributed to a suspected Chinese
state-sponsored threat activity group, which we are tracking as RedDelta.
Data sources include the Recorded Future® Platform, Farsight Security’s
DNSDB, SecurityTrails, VirusTotal, Shodan, BinaryEdge, and common OSINT
techniques.
This report will be of greatest interest to network defenders of private sector,
public sector, and non-governmental organizations with a presence in Asia, as well
as those interested in Chinese geopolitics.

Executive Summary
From early May 2020, The Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of
Hong Kong were among several Catholic Church-related organizations
that were targeted by RedDelta, a Chinese-state sponsored threat
activity group tracked by Insikt Group. This series of suspected network
intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study Mission to China and the
Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), Italy. These organizations
have not been publicly reported as targets of Chinese threat activity
groups prior to this campaign.

Party. Most recently, a July 2020 U.S. indictment identified the targeting of emails
belonging to Chinese Christian religious figures — a Xi’an-based pastor, as well as
an underground church pastor in Chengdu, the latter of whom was later arrested
by the PRC government, by two contractors allegedly operating on behalf of the
Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). Regional branches of China’s Ministry
of Public Security (MPS) have also been heavily involved in digital surveillance of
ethnic and religious minorities within the PRC, most notably by the Xinjiang Public
Security Bureau (XPSB) in the case of Uighur muslims.
Historically, the PRC has had a highly turbulent relationship with the Vatican
and its governing body, the Holy See. In particular, the Holy See’s recognition
of bishops within China’s historically persecuted “underground” Catholic church
traditionally loyal to the Vatican and its relationship with Taiwan has maintained
an absence of official relations since the 1950s. The CCP perceived this behavior
as the Holy See interfering in religious matters within China. In September 2018,
the PRC and the Holy See reached a landmark two-year provisional agreement,
marking a significant step towards renewed diplomatic relations.
Under the provisional agreement, China would regain more control over
underground churches, and the Vatican in turn would gain increased influence
over the appointment of bishops within the state-backed “official” Catholic church.
The deal was met with a mixed reaction, with critics arguing that the deal was
a betrayal of the underground church and would lead to increased persecution
of its members. Many of the harshest criticisms came from clergy within Hong
Kong. A year after the agreement, numerous reports noted the Vatican’s silence in
response to the Hong Kong protests beginning in late 2019, in what critics called
an effort to avoid offending Beijing and jeopardizing the 2018 agreement.

The lure document shown above, which has been previously reported on in
relation to links to Hong Kong Catholic Church targeting, was used to deliver a
customized PlugX payload that communicated with the C2 domain systeminfor[.]

current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China. It is currently unclear
whether the actors created the document themselves, or whether it is a legitimate
document they were able to obtain and weaponize. Given that the letter was
directly addressed to this individual, it is likely that he was the target of a
spearphishing attempt. Additionally, as this sample was compiled after signs of
an intrusion within the Vatican network, it is also possible that the phishing lure
was sent through a compromised Vatican account. This hypothesis is supported by

Table 1: List of organizations targeted by RedDelta.

The organizations targeted by RedDelta in this campaign largely align
with historical activity publicly reported on the threat activity group Mustang
Panda, with the group previously linked to intrusion attempts targeting the Police
of the Sindh Province in Pakistan, law enforcement organizations in India, and
the targeting of entities within Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Ethiopia. The group is
also suspected to have previously targeted China Center (China Zentrum e.V),
a non-profit organization whose members includes Catholic aid organizations,
religious orders and dioceses in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, and other
organizations associated with religious and minority groups.

Infrastructure Analysis
In this campaign, RedDelta favored three primary IP hosting providers, and
used multiple C2 servers within the same /24 CIDR ranges across intrusions.
Preferred hosting providers included 2EZ Network Inc (Canada), Hong Kong
Wen Jing Network Limited, and Hong Kong Ai Jia Su Network Limited. The group
consistently registered domains through GoDaddy, with WHOIS data providing
additional linkages between domains used by the threat activity group. Insikt
Group identified two primary clusters of RedDelta infrastructure used throughout
this campaign, referred to as the “PlugX cluster” and the “Poison Ivy and Cobalt
Strike cluster.” A Maltego chart is included below displaying these clusters.

‘Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian’ and the PlugX
Cluster
Vatican hosts and several other victim organizations were communicating
with the PlugX C2 167.88.180[.]5 from May until June 10, 2020. This IP hosted the
domain cabsecnow[.]com over this time period. Cabsecnow[.]com then resolved to
a new IP, 103.85.24[.]136, from June 10 onwards. The suspicious network activity
continued after the C2 IP was updated, increasing our confidence in the likelihood
of intrusion at the targeted organizations.
The cabsecnow[.]com domain shares a similar naming convention to a publicly
reported domain linked to Mustang Panda, cab-sec[.]com. WHOIS data revealed
that both domains were registered several seconds apart through GoDaddy on
September 17, 2019, with the same registrant organization listed: “Ma Ge Bei Luo
Xiang Gang Jiu Dian.” This registrant organization is associated with eight domains
in total, five of which have previously been publicly linked to Mustang Panda
activity by Anomali and Dell SecureWorks. “Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian”

the PlugX variant used in association with this campaign has key differences
from more traditional PlugX variants, particularly in the C2 protocol used and
the configuration encoding within the samples, leading us to refer to it as the
“RedDelta PlugX” variant below — however, this is not intended to suggest that
this variant is used exclusively by this group and is in reference to the first group
we have seen using this variant.

In each case, the file (“hk.dat” or “qum.dat“) is downloaded and executed after
initial execution of the phishing lure, as described above in “Stage 1: Wwlib.dll DLL

compressed, as well as XOR-encoded. The XOR key precedes the encoded data,
allowing the file to be more easily decoded during static analysis. A Python script
to decompress and decode the payload can be found on our GitHub repository.
After the DAT files are decompressed and decoded, they are executed. The

However, the configuration block for the RedDelta PlugX variant has one
key distinction: the Avira-reported Mustang Panda configuration block decoding
function looks for the string “XXXXXXXX” to determine whether the configuration

the different demarcator strings, both variants use the same rolling XOR encoding
with the key “123456789.” The configuration block decode routine can be seen

Command and Control Protocol
The C2 protocol used for the RedDelta PlugX malware differs from the Mustang
Panda PlugX. While both variants use the HTTP POST method common to PlugX
including the number of “61456” in the POST header field which is a clear indicator
of a PlugX HTTP POST. However, the RedDelta variant does not include the URI
string “/update?wd=” more commonly associated with PlugX, as seen in Figure 12.

Figure 12: HTTP POST request from Anomali/Avira PlugX variant and RedDelta PlugX variant.

The RedDelta PlugX variant encrypts its C2 communications very differently
when compared to the Mustang Panda variant reported by Anomali and Avira.
Instead of using XOR encoding, RedDelta uses RC4 encryption where the first
10 bytes of the passcode are hardcoded and the last four bytes are randomly
generated and included as a key within the TCP packet so that the communication
can be decrypted. The hardcoded portion of the RC4 passphrase is “!n&U*O%Pb$.”
Figure 13 shows the function where the RC4 passphrase is defined as well as
where the last four bytes are appended to create the full key. A Python script to
decode the RedDelta C2 communication from a supplied PCAP can be found on
our GitHub repository.
Despite the different C2 encryption schemes, both RedDelta and Mustang
Panda variants’ C2 traffic decrypts to the familiar PlugX header format, as shown
in Figure 14.

Figure 14: PlugX header and data.

In conventional PlugX samples, the C2 uses the same algorithm as in the
configuration decode (see Figure 11), with part of the key being the first four bytes
of the TCP transmission. While the RedDelta PlugX variant also uses the first four
bytes of the TCP transmission as a part of the key, the use of RC4 for C2 encryption
demonstrates a departure from the usual PlugX C2 traffic encryption mechanism.

RC4 key used in RedDelta PlugX variant.

While Recorded Future has not done extensive code analysis to further
compare the samples, we have highlighted fundamental differences between the
RedDelta PlugX variants and conventional PlugX, notably in the configuration block
and C2 communication. Additionally, while RedDelta has implemented a modular
delivery system based on traditional PlugX tactics, it also provides the group with
the ability to change, enhance or remove functionality as needed.

function contained within it.
DotNetLoader40.exe is a small .NET executable that essentially downloads and
then executes shellcode. The main function in DotNetLoader is “RunRemoteCode”
which takes a URL as an argument. The content is downloaded from the provided
URL, in this case, http://154.213.21[.]27/beacon.txt, and then sent to the function
“InjectShellCode.” The shellcode is then base64 decoded, decompressed, saved
to memory, and executed.
The shellcode loaded is Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is configured using the
Havex Malleable C2 profile. This Havex C2 code has been published on GitHub
and can be used by any entity that wishes to use it; and in this case, the attacker
is doing so in conjunction with Cobalt Strike. This can be seen both through the

Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy

Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat actors
and their activity, focusing on state actors from China, Iran, Russia,
and North Korea, as well as cyber criminals - individuals and groups

ADVERSARY

- from Russia, CIS states, China, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize
tracking activity groups and where possible, attributing them to
nation state government, organizations, or affiliate institutions.
Our coverage includes:
•

Government organizations and intelligence agencies,
their associated laboratories, partners, industry
collaborators, proxy entities, and individual threat
actors.

•

INFRASTRUCTURE

CAPABILITY

Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation state
activity groups, such as RedAlpha, RedBravo, Red Delta,
and BlueAlpha and many other industry established
groups.

•

Cybercriminal individuals and groups established and
named by Recorded Future

•

VICTIM

Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,persistent
commodity malware

Insikt Group names a new threat activity group or campaign
when analysts have data corresponding to at least three points
on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium
confidence, derived from our Security Intelligence Graph. We can tie
this to a threat actor only when we can point to a handle, persona,
person, or organization responsible. We will write about the activity
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data. We
use the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a particular
group when the public body of empirical evidence is clear the activity
corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet
naming convention for new nation state threat actor groups or
campaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag colors,
currently represented below, with more color/nation pairings to
be added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups
associated with new nations.

For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt Group uses a
naming convention corresponding to the Greek alphabet. Where we
have identified a criminal entity connected to a particular country,
we will use the appropriate country color, and where that group may
be tied to a specific government organization, tie it to that entity
specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming newly
identified malware.
