Emotet is back in action after a short break
zscaler.com/blogs/research/emotet-back-action-after-short-break

It’s common for cybercriminals to launch an attack, then shortly thereafter stop the campaign before they are detected. These breaks also
give these bad actors a chance to change tactics to, once again, attempt to avoid detection. That’s what operators using the Emotet malware
did, taking a short break before bringing Emotet back in a new, more dangerous form.
Emotet operators took about a two-month break as command and control (C&C) servers went down in late May and came back online around
the end of August. Then, we began observing a new version of this malware around mid-September.
Emotet started as a banking trojan in 2014. However, it has morphed into a very prominent threat. Now, it is mostly used for spamming and
downloading additional malware threats on a target system. Based on the unique sample count of malware threats seen by the Zscaler Cloud
Sandbox, Emotet and its downloaders appear to be among the most prevalent threats in 2019, followed by banking trojans and loaders, such
as TrickBot and Ursnif, remote-access trojans (RATs), and off-the-shelf password stealers, such as LokiBot and AZORult.
Emotet is modular by design, as it supports multiple modules for different tasks, such as stealing information, spamming, and more. It is also
known to download and to be downloaded by other malware families, such as TrickBot and Ursnif. It has also been associated with the Ryuk
ransomware.

Email conversation hijacking
This year, Emotet employed a new tactic of using stolen email content in spam campaigns. The hijacking of existing email threads can be
very effective as recipients are tricked into believing that the email was sent by the other person in the email thread. This trust factor can lead
to the victim opening the email (and attachment) and getting infected with Emotet, effectively making the infected system part of an
Emotet botnet.

New campaign, new document templates, and new botnets?
We observed the following new templates in spammed malicious documents (maldocs) during this new campaign.

Earlier, there were two Emotet botnets, known as Epoch 1 (E1) and Epoch2 (E2), that were using unique RSA keys to communicate with their
C&C. After the break, we noticed three new RSA keys being used, which suggests the possibility of a botnet splitting into multiple botnets.
Earlier keys were no longer seen in use and the latest three keys are now being used, which means operators are reorganizing their botnet
infrastructure.

Figure 5: Emotet RSA keys used before and after the break.

RSA1 and RSA2 were used before the break. In this new campaign, we saw Emotet using RSA3, RSA4, and RSA5. (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are
assigned based on their first observation sequence in the wild).
Before the break, the two RSA keys didn't share any C&C infrastructure. In this new campaign, two sub-botnets are sharing some
infrastructure (as shown in the following screenshots).

Figure 7: RSA keys and C&C infrastructure of the new Emotet campaign.
If we check the overall C&C infrastructure and RSA key relationships before and after the break, we can clearly see a reorganization of the
C&C infrastructure, which is now divided among three new Epochs. One Epoch is divided into two while the other one is used to create a
single botnet with some new C&Cs.

Emotet Downloader payload - Technical analysis
The Emotet infection cycle generally starts with spam emails containing malicious macro documents that drop a JavaScript file. This
JavaScript file further downloads the Emotet payload from a compromised WordPress website. Almost all the samples we observed were
served from compromised WordPress websites (mostly version 5.2.3).
We will take a look at one such malicious document for the purpose of analysis here MD5 – 359696113a2156617c28d4f79cc7d44b (“file 20190924 LTR6051.doc”)
The macro in the documents is quite simple and straightforward but contains lots of junk.

After removing the junk, this is how the macro code looks.

Figure 10: Cleaned macro code.

It gets its text from TextBox1 in UserForm2, then saves that in a "JS" file before executing that file.

Figure 11: A user form containing javascript code.

This JavaScript file is heavily obfuscated. More obfuscation is being added to the "JS" code incrementally. As in earlier versions of this
downloader, some of the strings and function names were readable and now almost every string is obfuscated.

Figure 12: Heavily obfuscated script

This script contains an array of strings in variable “a.” First, the elements of the array are shuffled using an anonymous function just after the
array definition. Then there is function “b,” which is used to decrypt strings and is extensively used throughout the script. Using this function,
we can log the decrypted strings just before they return. Some of the interesting strings include:
\+\+ *(?:_0x(?:[a-f0-9]){4,6}|(?:\b|\d)[a-z0-9]{1,4}(?:\b|\d))

Not Supported File Format
There was an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be repaired (for example, it was sent as an email
attachment and wasn't correctly decoded).
The script's functionality can be clearly determined from the decrypted strings. It downloads, saves, and runs its payload from a list of URLs
and shows the following message box to trick a user into believing the file is corrupt:

Conclusion
Emotet is an ever-evolving threat, employing new tricks and tactics. Although it started as a banking trojan, Emotet is now associated with
several different malware campaigns, including ransomware and infostealers. The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team proactively tracks and ensures
coverage to block downloaders, payloads, and C&C activity from Emotet and other threats.
