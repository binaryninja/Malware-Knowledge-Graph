Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-209a

Summary
This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory was coauthored by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security
Centre (NCSC), and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
This advisory provides details on the top 30 vulnerabilities—primarily Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVEs)—routinely exploited by malicious cyber actors in 2020 and those being widely exploited thus far in
2021.
Cyber actors continue to exploit publicly known—and often dated—software vulnerabilities against broad
target sets, including public and private sector organizations worldwide. However, entities worldwide can
mitigate the vulnerabilities listed in this report by applying the available patches to their systems and
implementing a centralized patch management system.

Technical Details
Key Findings
In 2020, cyber actors readily exploited recently disclosed vulnerabilities to compromise unpatched systems.
Based on available data to the U.S. Government, a majority of the top vulnerabilities targeted in 2020 were
disclosed during the past two years. Cyber actor exploitation of more recently disclosed software flaws in 2020
probably stems, in part, from the expansion of remote work options amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid
shift and increased use of remote work options, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and cloud-based
environments, likely placed additional burden on cyber defenders struggling to maintain and keep pace with
routine software patching.
Four of the most targeted vulnerabilities in 2020 affected remote work, VPNs, or cloud-based
technologies. Many VPN gateway devices remained unpatched during 2020, with the growth of remote work
options challenging the ability of organizations to conduct rigorous patch management.
CISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI consider the vulnerabilities listed in table 1 to be the topmost regularly
exploited CVEs by cyber actors during 2020.

In 2021, malicious cyber actors continued to target vulnerabilities in perimeter-type devices. Among those
highly exploited in 2021 are vulnerabilities in Microsoft, Pulse, Accellion, VMware, and Fortinet.
CISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI assess that public and private organizations worldwide remain vulnerable to
compromise from the exploitation of these CVEs. Malicious cyber actors will most likely continue to use older
known vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-11882 affecting Microsoft Office, as long as they remain effective
and systems remain unpatched. Adversaries’ use of known vulnerabilities complicates attribution, reduces
costs, and minimizes risk because they are not investing in developing a zero-day exploit for their exclusive
use, which they risk losing if it becomes known.
Organizations are encouraged to remediate or mitigate vulnerabilities as quickly as possible to reduce the risk
of exploitation. Most can be remediated by patching and updating systems. Organizations that have not
remediated these vulnerabilities should investigate for the presence of IOCs and, if compromised, initiate
incident response and recovery plans. See the Contact Information section below for how to reach CISA to
report an incident or request technical assistance.

2020 CVEs
CISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI have identified the following as the topmost exploited vulnerabilities by
malicious cyber actors from 2020: CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-5902,
CVE-2020-15505, CVE-2020-0688, CVE-2019-3396, CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2019-11580, CVE-2018-7600,
CVE 2019-18935, CVE-2019-0604, CVE-2020-0787, CVE-2020-1472.[1][2][3] Among these vulnerabilities,
CVE-2019-19781 was the most exploited flaw in 2020, according to U.S. Government technical analysis.CVE2019-19781 is a recently disclosed critical vulnerability in Citrix’s Application Delivery Controller (ADC)—a
load balancing application for web, application, and database servers widely use throughout the United

2/19

States.[4][5] Nation-state and criminal cyber actors most likely favor using this vulnerability because it is easy
to exploit, Citrix servers are widespread, and exploitation enables the actors to perform unauthorized RCE on
a target system.[6]
Identified as emerging targets in early 2020,[7] unremediated instances of CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-201911510 continued to be exploited throughout the year by nation-state advanced persistent threat actors (APTs)
who leveraged these and other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2018-13379[8][9], in VPN services[10][11] to
compromise an array of organizations, including those involved in COVID-19 vaccine development.[12][13]
The CVE-2019-11510 vulnerability in Pulse Connect Secure VPN was also frequently targeted by nation-state
APTs. Actors can exploit the vulnerability to steal the unencrypted credentials for all users on a compromised
Pulse VPN server and retain unauthorized credentials for all users on a compromised Pulse VPN server and
can retain unauthorize access after the system is patched unless all compromised credentials are changed.
Nation-state APTs also commonly exploited CVE-2020-15505 and CVE-2020-5902.[14][15][16][17]

2021 CVEs
In 2021, cyber actors continued to target vulnerabilities in perimeter-type devices. In addition to the 2020
CVEs listed above, organizations should prioritize patching for the following CVEs known to be exploited.
Microsoft Exchange: CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065
See CISA’s Alert: Mitigate Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities for more information on
identifying and mitigating malicious activity concerning these vulnerabilities.
Pulse Secure: CVE-2021-22893, CVE-2021-22894, CVE-2021-22899, and CVE-2021-22900
See CISA’s Alert: Exploitation of Pulse Connect Secure Vulnerabilities for more information on how
to investigate and mitigate this malicious activity.
Accellion: CVE-2021-27101, CVE-2021-27102, CVE-2021-27103, CVE-2021-27104
See the Australia-New Zealand-Singapore-UK-U.S. Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: Exploitation of
Accellion File Transfer Appliance for technical details and mitigations.
VMware: CVE-2021-21985
See CISA’s Current Activity: Unpatched VMware vCenter Software for more information and
guidance.
Fortinet: CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and CVE-2019-5591
See the CISA-FBI Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: APT Actors Exploit Vulnerabilities to Gain Initial
Access for Future Attacks for more details and mitigations.

Mitigations and Indicators of Compromise
One of the most effective best practices to mitigate many vulnerabilities is to update software versions once
patches are available and as soon as is practicable. If this is not possible, consider applying temporary
workarounds or other mitigations, if provided by the vendor. If an organization is unable to update all software
shortly after a patch is released, prioritize implementing patches for CVEs that are already known to be
exploited or that would be accessible to the largest number of potential attackers (such as internet-facing
systems). This advisory highlights vulnerabilities that should be considered as part of the prioritization
process. To further assist remediation, automatic software updates should be enabled whenever possible.
Focusing scarce cyber defense resources on patching those vulnerabilities that cyber actors most often use
offers the potential of bolstering network security while impeding our adversaries’ operations. For example,
nation-state APTs in 2020 extensively relied on a single RCE vulnerability discovered in the Atlassian Crow, a
centralized identity management and application (CVE-2019-11580) in its reported operations. A concerted
focus on patching this vulnerability could have a relative broad impact by forcing the actors to find alternatives,
which may not have the same broad applicability to their target set.
3/19

Additionally, attackers commonly exploit weak authentication processes, particularly in external-facing
devices. Organizations should require multi-factor authentication to remotely access networks from external
sources, especially for administrator or privileged accounts.
Tables 2–14 provide more details about, and specific mitigations for, each of the top exploited CVEs in 2020.
Note: The lists of associated malware corresponding to each CVE below are not meant to be exhaustive but
intended to identify a malware family commonly associated with exploiting the CVE.

Table 2: CVE-2019-19781 Vulnerability Details
Citrix Netscaler Directory Traversal (CVE-2019-19781)
Vulnerability Description
Citrix Netscaler Application Delivery Control (ADC) is vulnerable to RCE and full system
compromise due to poor access controls, thus allowing directory traversal.

CVSS
3.02

Vulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns

Fix

The lack of adequate access controls allows an attacker to enumerate system directories for
vulnerable code (directory traversal). In this instance, Citrix ADC maintains a vulnerable Perl
script ( newbm.pl ) that, when accessed via HTTP POST request ( POST
https://$TARGET/vpn/../vpn/portal/scripts/newbm.pl ), allows local operating system
(OS) commands to execute. Attackers can use this functionality to upload/execute command
and control (C2) software (webshell or reverse-shell executable) using embedded commands
(e.g., curl , wget , Invoke-WebRequest ) and gain unauthorized access to the OS.

Microsoft Office Memory Corruption (CVE 2017-11882)
Vulnerability Description
Microsoft Office is prone to a memory corruption vulnerability allowing an attacker to run
arbitrary code, in the context of the current user, by failing to properly handle objects in memory.
It is also known as the "Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability."

CVSS
3.0
High

Cyber actors continued to exploit this four-year-old vulnerability in Microsoft Office that the U.S.
Government publicly assessed last year was the most frequently targeted. Cyber actors most
likely continue to exploit this vulnerability because Microsoft Office use is ubiquitous worldwide,
the vulnerability is ideal for phasing campaigns, and it enables RCE on vulnerable systems.

10/19

Vulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns

Fix

Microsoft Equation Editor, a component of Microsoft Office, contains a stack buffer overflow
vulnerability that enables RCE on a vulnerable system. The component was compiled on
November 9, 2000. Without any further recompilation, it was used in all currently supported
versions of Microsoft Office. Microsoft Equation Editor is an out-of-process COM server that is
hosted by eqnedt32.exe , meaning it runs as its own process and can accept commands from
other processes.

Patch
Available

Data execution prevention (DEP) and address space layout randomization (ASLR) should
protect against such attacks. However, because of the manner in which eqnedt32.exe was
linked, it will not use these features, subsequently allowing code execution. Being an out-ofprocess COM server, protections specific to Microsoft Office such as EMET and Windows
Defender Exploit Guard are not applicable to eqnedt32.exe , unless applied system-wide. This
provides the attacker with an avenue to lure targets into opening specially crafted documents,
resulting in the ability to execute an embedded attacker commands.
Multiple cyber espionage campaigns have taken advantage of this vulnerability. CISA has noted
CVE-2017-11882 being exploited to deliver LokiBot malware.
Recommended Mitigations
To remediate this issue, administrators should deploy Microsoft’s patch for this
vulnerability: https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE2017-11882.
Those who cannot deploy the patch should consider disabling the Equation Editor as
discussed in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4055535.

Vulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns

Fix

An RCE vulnerability exists within multiple subsystems of Drupal 7.x and 8.x. This potentially
allows attackers to exploit multiple attack vectors on a Drupal site, which could result in the site
being completely compromised. Failed exploit attempts may result in a denial-of-service
condition. A remote user can send specially crafted data to trigger a flaw in the processing of
renderable arrays in the Form Application Programming Interface, or API, and cause the target
system to render the user-supplied data and execute arbitrary code on the target system.

Patch
Available

Malware campaigns include the Muhstik botnet and XMRig Monero Cryptocurrency mining.
Recommended Mitigations
Upgrade to the most recent version of Drupal 7 or 8 core. If running 7.x, upgrade to Drupal
7.58. If running 8.5.x, upgrade to Drupal 8.5.1.

Table 12: CVE 2019-18935 Vulnerability Details
Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX Insecure Deserialization (CVE 2019-18935)
Vulnerability Description

CVS 3.0

Telerik User Interface (UI) for ASP.NET does not properly filter serialized input for malicious
content. Versions prior to R1 2020 (2020.1.114) are susceptible to remote code execution
attacks on affected web servers due to a deserialization vulnerability.

Critical

13/19

Vulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns

Fix

The Telerik UI does not properly sanitize serialized data inputs from the user. This vulnerability
leads to the application being vulnerable to RCE attacks that may lead to a full system
compromise. A vulnerable HTTP POST parameter rauPostData makes use of a vulnerable
function/object AsyncUploadHandler . The object/function uses the
JavaScriptSerializer.Deserialize() method, which not not properly sanitize the
serialized data during the deserialization process. This issue is attacked by:

Patch
Available

1. Determining the vulnerable function is available/registered:
http://<HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau ,
2. Determining if the version running is vulnerable by querying the UI, and
3. Creating an object (e.g., malicious mixed-mode DLL with native OS commands or Reverse
Shell) and uploading the object via rauPostData parameter along with the proper
encryption key.

There were two malware campaigns associated with this vulnerability:
Netwalker Ransomware and
Blue Mockbird Monero Cryptocurrency-mining.
Recommended Mitigations
Update to the most recent version of Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX (at least 2020.1.114 or
later).
Detection Methods
ACSC has an example PowerShell script that can be used to identify vulnerable Telerik UI
DLLs on Windows web server hosts.
Vulnerable hosts should be reviewed for evidence of exploitation. Indicators of exploitation
can be found in IIS HTTP request logs and within the Application Windows event log.
Details of the above PowerShell script and exploitation detection recommendations are
available in ACSC Advisory 2020-004.
Exploitation of this and previous Telerik UI vulnerabilities commonly resulted in the
installation of web shell malware. NSA provides guidance on detecting and preventing web
shell malware.
Vulnerable Technologies and Versions
Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX versions prior to R1 2020 (2020.1.114) are affected.

Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in an XML deserialization component within Microsoft SharePoint allowed remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Microsoft SharePoint servers.

CVSS
3.0
Critical

Vulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns

Fix

This vulnerability was typically exploited to install webshell malware to vulnerable hosts. A
webshell could be placed in any location served by the associated Internet Information Services
(IIS) web server and did not require authentication. These web shells would commonly be
installed in the Layouts folder within the Microsoft SharePoint installation directory, for example:

Patch
Available

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\
<version_number>\Template\Layouts

The xmlSerializer.Deserialize() method does not adequately sanitize user input that is
received from the PickerEnitity/ValidateEnity ( picker.aspx ) functions in the serialized XML
payloads. Once the serialized XML payload is deserialized, the XML code is evaulated for
relevant XML commands and stings. A user can attack .Net based XML parsers with XMLNS
payloads using the < system:string > tag and embedding malicious operating system
commands.
The exploit was used in malware phishing and the WickrMe/Hello Ransomware campaigns.
Recommended Mitigations
Upgrade on-premise installations of Microsoft Sharepoint to the latest available version
(Microsoft SharePoint 2019) and patch level.
On-premise Microsoft SharePoint installations with a requirement to be accessed by
internet-based remote staff should be moved behind an appropriate authentication
mechanism such as a VPN, if possible.
Detection Methods
The patch level of on-premise Microsoft SharePoint installations should be reviewed for
the presence of relevant security updates as outlined in the Microsoft SharePoint security
advisory.
Vulnerable SharePoint servers should be reviewed for evidence of attempted exploitation.
ACSC Advisory 2019-125 contains advice on reviewing IIS HTTP request logs for
evidence of potential exploitation.
NSA provides guidance on detecting and preventing web shell malware.
Vulnerable Technologies and Versions
At the time of the vulnerability release, the following Microsoft SharePoint versions were
affected: Microsoft Sharepoint 2019, Microsoft SharePoint 2016, Microsoft SharePoint 2013
SP1, and Microsoft SharePoint 2010 SP2.

Table 15: CVE-2020-1472 Vulnerability Details
Microsoft Netlogon Elevation of Privilege (CVE-2020-1472)
Vulnerability Description

CVSS
3.0

The Microsoft Windows Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC) reuses a known, static, zerovalue initialization vector (VI) in AES-CFB8 mode, which could allow an unauthenticated attacker Critical
to impersonate a domain-joined computer including a domain controller, and potentially obtain
domain administrator privileges.
Vulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns

Fix

To exploit this vulnerability, an actor would first need to have an existing presence on an internal
network with network connectivity to a vulnerable Domain Controller, assuming that Domain
Controllers are not exposed to the internet.

Patch
Available

The immediate effect of successful exploitation results in the ability to authentication to the
vulnerable Domain Controller with Domain Administrator level credentials. In compromises
exploiting this vulnerability, exploitation was typically followed immediately by dumping all
hashes for Domain accounts.
Threat actors were seen combining the MobileIron CVE-2020-15505 vulnerability for initial
access, then using the Netlogon vulnerability to facilitate lateral movement and further
compromise of target networks.
A nation-state APT group has been observed exploiting this vulnerability.[18]
Recommended Mitigations
Apply the security updates as recommended in the Microsoft Netlogon security advisory.
Detection Methods
The patch level of Domain Controllers should be reviewed for the presence of relevant
security updates as outlined in the Microsoft Netlogon security advisory.
Reviewing and monitoring Windows Event Logs can identify potential exploitation
attempts. However, further investigation would still be required to eliminate legitimate
activity. Further information on these event logs is available in the ACSC 2020-016
Advisory.
