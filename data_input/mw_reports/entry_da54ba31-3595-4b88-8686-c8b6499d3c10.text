REPORT

Introduction
Babuk ransomware is a new ransomware threat discovered in 2021 that attacked at least
five big enterprises, with one already paying the criminals $85,000 after negotiations. This
ransomware, as other variants, is deployed in the network of enterprises that the criminals
carefully target and compromise. This modus operandi is known as the Big-Game hunting
strategy.
The group behind Babuk has also adopted the same strategies as other ransomware groups
and has leaked the stolen data.
The sample analyzed in this report has the following hash:
8203c2f00ecd3ae960cb3247a7d7bfb35e55c38939607c85dbdb5c92f0495fa9.
This hash is related to version 1 of Babuk. It comes as an executable of 32 bits compiled
in Visual C/C++ and has a small size of 30kb. This initial version is neither protected nor
obfuscated.
In this report, McAfee® Advanced Threat Research (ATR) provides a deep insight of this new
ransomware variant called Babuk.

■

■

■

Babuk ransomware is a new ransomware family originally
detected at the beginning of 2021.
Its operators adopted the same operating methods as
other ransomware families and leaked the stolen data.

■

Babuk’s codebase and artefacts are highly similar to Vasa
Locker’s.

■

Babuk advertises on both English-speaking and Russianspeaking forums.
The individuals behind Babuk ransomware have
explicitly expressed themselves negatively against the
BlackLivesMatter (BLM) and LGBT communities.
At least five companies have been breached as of
January 15, 2021.

■

■

The ransomware supports command line operation
and embeds three different built-in commands used to
spread itself and encrypt network resources.
It checks the services and processes running so it can kill
a predefined list and avoid detection.
There are no local language checks, in contrast to other
ransomware gangs that normally spare devices in certain
countries.
The limited diffusion of the ransomware may indicate
that those behind it are not working within an organized
group or with other partners.
The most recent variant has been spotted packed (see
the ‘Additional Resources’ section).

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

REPORT

Infection Map

Underground
Babuk actors have been very verbose on an underground forum. The
following screenshot shows a post where the authors advertised their leaks
and their new support website.

Figure 1. Infection map.

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

REPORT

As seen in the screenshot below, the persona with the username “Biba99,”
created on August 26, 2020, has been active on the forum. All of Biba99’s
posts are in the English language.

Published evidence suggests the group breached companies in the transport,
healthcare, plastic, electronics, and agricultural sectors.
However, only two companies so far have had their data published by those
behind the Babuk ransomware. This may indicate that the other victims
decided to pay the ransom to avoid having their data leaked. The Babuk
operators have indicated they may have breached several other companies.

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

Two websites are currently accessible; one is used to release the stolen data
while the other is used as a support website:

hxxp://gtmx56k4hutn3ikv.onion

■

hxxp://babukq4e2p4wu4iq.onion

REPORT

Underground Observations
The team behind Babuk first gained attention by advertising its activity on
an English-speaking forum. Initially this was a bit out of the ordinary, since
most major ransomware families prominently advertise and communicate
on the Russian-speaking forums, though it was not long before we noticed
Babuk activity on them too. Below is a screenshot of an affiliate recruitment
advertisement, machine translated from Russian.

Interestingly, in the new version of the website, the malware developers
changed the name from Babuk to Babyk. In Russian, the Cyrillic letter Y
sounds similar to the Latin letter U.
It is interesting to note that the Babuk authors are making efforts to gain
legitimacy on underground forums, either to advertise for future stolen data
or to find potential new partners.

The advertisements on the Russian-speaking forums were more geared
towards affiliate recruitment and details on technical improvements of their
malware, whereas the English-speaking forum advertisements were more
focused on victim announcements.

7

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

REPORT

As mentioned earlier, Babuk’s posts are quite verbose. In its initial
introductory message, Babuk states that it does not attack (whitelist)
hospitals, non-profits, schools, or companies with less than a certain amount
of revenue.

Update for Unix Machines
In a recent post we observed a new comment from the Babuk authors, which
suggests they have prepared a Unix variant of the ransomware, to target
NAS, ESXi servers or any other Unix system.

However, what stands out is the explicit mention that it does attack
organizations that support the LGBTQ or BlackLivesMatter causes. We have
not observed this explicit mentioning before and believe, with a medium
level of confidence, that this might be an indication that the criminals
behind Babuk are from a social climate where LGBTQ and equality are not
supported.
The explicit mentioning of the business intelligence tool ZoomInfo confirms
our belief that ransomware criminals not only use the breached access to
their victim’s network to determine a ransom amount, but also rely on such
tools to determine the net worth of an organization.

8

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

This message shows that Babuk authors are enforcing their relationship with
potential partners or customers and extending their capabilities to other
systems. We are actively monitoring this threat to detect future versions of
the ransomware.

REPORT

Technical Details
The compiled timestamp is December 30, 2020. The sample was compiled
without support for operating systems prior to Windows Vista. This is the first
version released by the Babuk actors.

The first action is a check for the arguments provided in the command line,
using the function “GetCommandLineA.” This is done later with a custom
function to get the buffer of arguments prepared.

More information about the sample can be seen in the following table:
Name

Compile time

30 December 2020 (seems legit)

The malware is a 32-bit executable (“.EXE”).
Figure 3. Get command line and arguments.

If no argument is passed, the malware has a mode to encrypt the network by
default, but the following arguments can be added in the command line:
-lanfirst
-lansecond
-nolan

Figure 2. Information about the sample.

The malware is not protected in any way and does not use any packer.

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

■

The switch “-lanfirst” forces the mode of behavior to be “1”

■

“-lansecond” forces the mode of behavior to be “0” (default value)

■

“-nolan” forces the mode of behavior to be “-1”

REPORT

Figure 5. Set shutdown level as critical process.

Figure 4. Check arguments.

These command line options allow the malware to be very flexible,
encrypting the mounted folder before or after the local disk. This support
to use arguments gives the operators an easy way to encrypt the network
resources.

The next action is enumerating all services in the system and stopping all of
those which exist in a hardcoded list in the malware.
To perform this action, the ransomware gets the Service Control Manager
using the function “OpenSCManagerA” and, with this handle, enumerates all
services in the system.

At this point, we can note a programming mistake. The malware checks all
arguments in the command line for these three switches and overrides the
behavior mode based on the last valid argument. The malware developers
do not use a “break” instruction to finish the argument loop when they get a
valid argument, wasting time.
For example, “malware.exe -lanfirst -nolan” prevents the malware from
encrypting the network as “-nolan” overrides the behavior mode of “-lanfirst.”
The next action is changing its shutdown level, setting this level to 0 with
the function “SetProcessShutdownParameters.” This behavior is not very
common in ransomware, but this forces the operating system to show a
warning message at shutdown/reboot time, saying the malware process
cannot be closed. The user is forced to reboot or shutdown the machine
manually.

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

Figure 6. Get Service Control Manager.

REPORT

The malware checks the status of the service if it is running. If this is the case,
it receives the list of services that depend on it and stops them.

The next action is checking the processes running in the victim system and
closing them if they have a name within a hardcoded list in the malware.

Figure 8. Get processes list in the victim machine.
Figure 7. Get service to stop.

For these actions, the functions “QueryServiceStatusEx,” “OpenServiceA,”
“EnumDependentServicesA,” and “ControlService” are used. The list of the
services closed can be read in the IOC part of this report.

For this, the malware uses the functions “CreateToolhelp32Snapshot,”
“Process32FirstW,” “Process32NextW,” “OpenProcess,” and
“TerminateProcess.”

Figure 9. Open the process and terminate it.

11

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

REPORT

The next action is destroying the shadow volumes of the victim machine.
It checks if the operating system is 64-bit or 32-bit using the function
“IsWow64Process” in a dynamic call (as it does not exist in 32-bit operating
systems) and removes the file system redirection to destroy the volumes.

Babuk checks its behavior mode and encrypts the files in the
network resources, using the functions “WNetOpenEnumW” and
“WNetEnumResourceW.”

Figure 10. Check operating system version.

To destroy the volume, it uses the native command “vssadmin.exe” with
“ShellExecuteW.”

Figure 12. Enumerate network resources.

In the encryption code, the developers made a slight mistake where they
create a number of threads based on double the value of CPU cores on the
victim machine. However, they later instantiate only one thread per logic disk
to encrypt. This means that the encryption process is slow, as it depends
on the number of disks, which is most likely lower than the number of
processors.
Figure 11. Destroy the shadow volumes.

The malware performs this action twice, first at the time of running, then
after encrypting all files.

12

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

Files are enumerated in the typical way for ransomware, but Babuk has
a curious check that other ransomwares do not have; it only encrypts a
maximum of 16 folders deep, meaning that if one folder has 17 or more
subfolders, the 17th and onward are ignored. This is probably to speed up
the encryption process.

REPORT

Figure 13. Check level of folder encryption.

The encryption process uses the ChaCha algorithm and protects the key and
nonce with ECDH (Elliptic Curves). The key and nonce are generated randomly
with the function “RltGenRandom.” The private and public keys for ECDH are
generated as such so that these keys are secure, finally using a public ECDH
hardcoded in the malware to get the final key that is used to protect the
ChaCha keys.
Only the malware developers can get this information as they have the
private key to decrypt these keys. Babuk saves the public key generated on
the disk in a file called “ecdh_pub_k.bin.” (NB: Version 2 of Babuk is not using
this file anymore.)
The files and folders to encrypt are checked with a typical hardcoded list with
blacklisted names. After checking if the name is valid to encrypt, it checks
whether the file has the ransom note name. In this case, it fetches the size of
the target file.

Figure 14. Save public key on disk.

If the size is less than 41,943,040 bytes, it encrypts it directly. If the size is
larger, it will split it into three parts.
Like other ransomware variants, Babuk uses the Windows cache to write the
files using “MapViewofFile.” This allows the malware to be faster and bypass
some security programs.

Figure 15. Map files to hasten the encryption process.

13

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

REPORT

Previously encrypted files have a new extension, “.__NIST_K571__,” appended
to them. The malware avoids all files that have this extension.

Another curious thing about Babuk is that before starting the encryption
process, it deletes the contents of the Recycle Bin using the function
“SHEmptyRecycleBinA.”

Figure 18. Empty all recycle bins in the system.

Figure 16. Add the extension hardcoded as encrypted file.

After encrypting all files in the folder, the malware drops a ransom note with
the hardcoded name of the victim. This may indicate that only one sample
per target is prepared. The ransomware note name is “How to Restore Your
Files.txt.”

Vasa Locker: v1 Before the v1?
Looking into Babuk’s history gives us insights into the team’s past activity.
By doing this research, we can potentially determine the duration of the
development process of the malware. We discovered a sample with a lot of
similarities named “Vasa Locker” on VirusTotal:

By briefly looking at the information, we can see that the sample was
compiled one month before the first release of Babuk v1.

REPORT

Vasa Locker has a lot of similarities with Babuk v1:
■

■

■

Ransom notes look quite similar.

In Vasa Locker’s ransom note, victims are asked to contact the actor by
using the mail babukrip@protonmail.ch.
The extension added to encrypted files is the same for both samples
“__NIST_K571__.”

■

The same cryptographic method is used by both samples.

■

The process kill list is the same.

■

The directories list is the same.

15

Technical Analysis of Babuk Ransomware

REPORT

By analyzing code similarities between Vasa Locker and the first version of
Babuk, we can see that around 86% of the code is shared:

Conclusion
Babuk ransomware is a new threat that first appeared in January 2021. The
team is gaining more visibility by advertising on underground forums.
The encryption function does not differ much from other ransomware. An
important point to note is the fact that no language blacklist is embedded in
the malware.
The codebase itself and artefacts dropped, like the ransom notes, are highly
similar to what was previously observed in Vasa Locker activities. There is a
clear connection between the two variants, and probably between the teams,
if indeed they are not one and the same.
What stands out with Babuk is the racial and anti-LGBTQ statements in its
advertisements.
We believe that the team started this business very recently, with limited
ransomware coding experience besides a potential Vasa Locker connection,
as the code appears to embed several bugs and has been delivered without
any obfuscation. However, the encryption algorithm used remains solid. Since
we began this write up, a new variant was discovered, improving some of
the mechanisms mentioned in this analysis. Additionally, a packed version of
Babuk has also been found.
McAfee ATR is actively monitoring this threat and will update accordingly.
