CNT suffers RansomEXX ransomware attack

2/5

While CNT has not officially stated that they suffered a ransomware attack,
BleepingComputer has learned that the attack was conducted by a ransomware operation
known as RansomEXX.
Security researcher Germán Fernández shared with BleepingComputer a hidden link to the
group's data leak site that warns CNT that the gang would leak data stolen during the attack
if CNT did not pay a ransom.
"Your time is LIMITED!
When this time will come to end, there are two ways: we will RAISE the ransom
amount or PUBLISH your files.
You will lose the opportunity to contact us after the data PUBLICATION.
If you REALLY WANT to prevent data leak, contact us RIGHT NOW.
We have downloaded 190GB+ of your files and we are ready to publish it." RansomEXX.

Hidden RansomEXX data leak page for CNT
This page is currently hidden from the public and can only be accessed via the direct link.
These hidden pages are commonly included in ransom notes to prove that a ransomware
operation stole data during an attack.
In CNT's press statement, the company states that corporate and customer data are secure
and have not been exposed.
However, the RansomEXX gang claims to have stolen 190 GB of data and shared
screenshots of some of the documents on the hidden data leak page.
The screenshots seen by BleepingComputer, include contact lists, contracts, and support
logs.

4/5

The ransomware operation originally launched under the name Defray in 2018 but became
more active in June 2020 when it rebranded as RansomEXX and began to target large
corporate entities.
Like other ransomware gangs, RansomEXX will compromise a network through purchased
credentials, brute-forced RDP servers, or by utilizing exploits.
Once they gain access to a network, they will quietly spread throughout the network while
stealing unencrypted files to be used for extortion attempts.
After gaining access to an administrator password, they deploy the ransomware on the
network and encrypt all of its devices.
As is becoming common among ransomware operations, RansomEXX created a Linux
version to ensure they can target all critical servers and virtual machines.
The RansomEXX gang's has a history of high-profile attacks, including Brazil's government
networks, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Konica Minolta, IPG Photonics, and
Tyler Technologies.
BleepingComputer has contacted CNT with further questions but has not received a
response at this time.
