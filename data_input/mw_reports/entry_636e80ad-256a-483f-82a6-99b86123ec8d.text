Threat Analysis Group

Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been closely monitoring the cybersecurity activity
in Eastern Europe with regard to the war in Ukraine. Since our last update, TAG has
observed a continuously growing number of threat actors using the war as a lure in phishing
and malware campaigns. Similar to other reports, we have also observed threat actors
increasingly target critical infrastructure entities including oil and gas, telecommunications
and manufacturing.
Government-backed actors from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, as well as various
unattributed groups, have used various Ukraine war-related themes in an effort to get targets
to open malicious emails or click malicious links. Financially motivated and criminal actors
are also using current events as a means for targeting users.
As always, we continue to publish details surrounding the actions we take against
coordinated influence operations in our quarterly TAG bulletin. We promptly identify and
remove any such content but have not observed any significant shifts from the normal levels
of activity that occur in the region.

Here is a deeper look at the campaign activity TAG has observed and the actions the team
has taken to protect our users over the past few weeks:
APT28 or Fancy Bear, a threat actor attributed to Russia GRU, was observed targeting
users in Ukraine with a new variant of malware. The malware, distributed via email
attachments inside of password protected zip files (ua_report.zip), is a .Net executable that
when executed steals cookies and saved passwords from Chrome, Edge and Firefox
browsers. The data is then exfiltrated via email to a compromised email account.

TAG would like to thank the Yahoo! Paranoids Advanced Cyber Threats Team for their
collaboration in this investigation.
Turla, a group TAG attributes to Russia FSB, continues to run campaigns against the Baltics,
targeting defense and cybersecurity organizations in the region. Similar to recently observed
activity, these campaigns were sent via email and contained a unique link per target that led
to a DOCX file hosted on attacker controlled infrastructure. When opened, the DOCX file
would attempt to download a unique PNG file from the same attacker controlled domain.
Recently observed Turla domains:
wkoinfo.webredirect[.]org
jadlactnato.webredirect[.]org
COLDRIVER, a Russian-based threat actor sometimes referred to as Callisto, continues to
use Gmail accounts to send credential phishing emails to a variety of Google and nonGoogle accounts. The targets include government and defense officials, politicians, NGOs
and think tanks, and journalists. The group's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for
these campaigns have shifted slightly from including phishing links directly in the email, to
also linking to PDFs and/or DOCs hosted on Google Drive and Microsoft One Drive. Within
these files is a link to an attacker controlled phishing domain.
These phishing domains have been blocked through Google Safe Browsing – a service that
identifies unsafe websites across the web and notifies users and website owners of potential
harm.

Ghostwriter, a Belarusian threat actor, has remained active during the course of the war and
recently resumed targeting of Gmail accounts via credential phishing. This campaign,
targeting high risk individuals in Ukraine, contained links leading to compromised websites
where the first stage phishing page was hosted. If the user clicked continue, they would be
redirected to an attacker controlled site that collected the users credentials. There were no
accounts compromised from this campaign and Google will alert all targeted users of these
attempts through our monthly government-backed attacker warnings.
Both pages from this campaign are shown below.

In mid-April, TAG detected a Ghostwriter credential phishing campaign targeting Facebook
users. The targets, primarily located in Lithuania, were sent links to attacker controlled
domains from a domain spoofing the Facebook security team.

Curious Gorge, a group TAG attributes to China's PLA SSF, has remained active against
government, military, logistics and manufacturing organizations in Ukraine, Russia and
Central Asia. In Russia, long running campaigns against multiple government organizations
have continued, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Over the past week, TAG identified
additional compromises impacting multiple Russian defense contractors and manufacturers
and a Russian logistics company.

Protecting Our Users
Upon discovery, all identified websites and domains were added to Safe Browsing to protect
users from further exploitation. We also send all targeted Gmail and Workspace users
government-backed attacker alerts notifying them of the activity. We encourage any potential
targets to enable Google Account Level Enhanced Safe Browsing and ensure that all
devices are updated.
The team continues to work around the clock, focusing on the safety and security of our
users and the platforms that help them access and share important information. We’ll
continue to take action, identify bad actors and share relevant information with others across
industry and governments, with the goal of bringing awareness to these issues, protecting
users and preventing future attacks. While we are actively monitoring activity related to
Ukraine and Russia, we continue to be just as vigilant in relation to other threat actors
globally, to ensure that they do not take advantage of everyone’s focus on this region.
