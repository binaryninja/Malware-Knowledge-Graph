The malware underground market might seem astoundingly professional in marketing and
support. Let's take a look under the covers of one particular malware-as-a-serviceâ€”the
clipboard banker Allcome.

Underground marketing
Allcome clipbanker was first discovered by researcher @3xp0rtblog including underground
forum screenshots, pricing information and a listing of contact numbers for Telegram where
the malware can be purchased and downloaded. This malware-as-a-service starts from 25$
for a month of usage up until 220$ for a life-time license.
The advertisment specifically highlights that Allcome supports stealing lots of different
cryptocurrency wallets and payment forms with new payment forms added weekly. Criminal
customers can also add their own currency stealing capabilities by purchasing a private
query builder.
The marketing for this malware might seem astounding, but what is really under the hood?

Functionality
Allcome is a relatively small (120 KB) native C/C++ program. All of the current versions have
the same persistent mechanism. They copy themselves into
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps\subst.exe and then set up a scheduled task
named NvTmRep_CrashReport3_{B2FE1952-0186} to run the clipper every minute.

3/7

The clipper creates a mutex named 08841d-18c7-4e2d-f7e29d, then it checks if the
filename starts with 'subst'. It applies the peristence mechanism described above if it doesn't.
The clipper retrieves the encrypted C2 URL from the PE resources and decrypts it. This
contains not only the C2 domain but also delivers a username of the criminal customer as
argument.
The server replies with either '+' or '-', depending on whether the criminal customer has a
valid license for the clipper. If the sever responds with '-', the clipper will not steal any
information. If the response is anything else, the clipper starts checking and potentially
replacing the clipboard contents.

Check if clipboard content is an email

The core functionality is in the clipboard content checking and replacement function. Like
every clipbanker, Allcome replaces cryptocurrency addresses with the address of the
attacker, so that transactions arrive at the attacker's wallet. The same is done for PayPal
4/7

addresses, Steam trade offer URLs and more.
This content checking and replacement code turns out to be rather basic. The clipper mostly
checks the length of strings and one or two characters (mostly the start of the string). It does
not take care where the content comes from and it does not make an effort to avoid false
clipboard content replacements.
The best example is the replacement for PayPal. If that option is used, any string containing
an '@' and a '.' afterwards will be replaced with the attacker's email. So anytime someone
copies an email address, it will be changed, even if that is only used to write emails to
someone. While the attacker may not mind receiving love letters, it also means the infection
is noisy and users of infected systems will realize early on that something is not right.

Configuration Extractor
The configuration for C2 and replacement wallets, steam trade offers, PayPal emails etc is
saved as encrypted strings in the String Table in the PE resources. Every ID in the string
table corresponds to a certain address that is used to replace the clipboard content with.
I wrote a decryption script in python to extract configurations en masse. The python script is
available in my Github repository and I added a list of extracted configurations there. Some
of the wallets have already transactions, possibly from infected systems. I collected the
samples via the VirusTotal query
"behaviour_network:dba692117be7b6d3480fe5220fdd58b38bf.xyz"

Conclusion
Unlike its elaborate marketing banner, Allcome clipbanker is very simple under the hood.
Especially its main functionality, the clipboard replacement, is not thought-out which is good
for potentially affected users, who will soon realize that something is wrong. Nevertheless it
seems to have gained quite some traction. A quick VirusTotal search already came up with
51 Allcome samples. Sometimes marketing is everything.
