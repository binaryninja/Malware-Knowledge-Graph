Malware
We analyzed samples of EMOTET, URSNIF, DRIDEX and BitPaymer and found similar
payload loaders and internal data structures, possibly implying that these different groups
are familiar with and are working closely together.

As ransomware and banking trojans captured the interest – and profits – of the world with
their destructive routines, cybersecurity practitioners have repeatedly published online and
offline how cybercriminals have compartmentalized their schemes through exchange of
information and banded professional organizations. As a more concrete proof of the way
these symbiotic relationships and work flows intersect, we discovered a connection between
EMOTET, URSNIF, DRIDEX and BitPaymer from open source information and the loaders
of the samples we had, functioning as if tasks were divided among different developers and
operators.

Background and details
In order to have a better understanding of the significance of these connections, here’s a
summarized background of each malware family:
URSNIF / GOZI-ISFB
Still considered as one of the global top threats, this banking trojan’s source code was
among those repeatedly leaked because of its evolution and notoriety for adaptive behaviors.
This spyware monitors traffic, features a keylogger, and steals credentials stored in browsers
and applications. The malware creators of GOZI admitted to its creation and distribution, and
was sentenced in 2015 and 2016.
DRIDEX
Another banking trojan that targets banking and financial institutions, the cybercriminals
behind it use various methods and techniques to steal personal information and credentials
through malicious attachments and HTML injections. DRIDEX evolved from CRIDEX,
GameOver Zeus and ZBOT, and proved to be resilient even after it was momentarily taken
down in 2015 through a partnership with the FBI.
EMOTET
Discovered by Trend Micro in 2014, this malware acts as a loader for payloads such as
Gootkit, ZeusPanda, IcedID, TrickBot, and DRIDEX for critical attacks. Other publications
have also mentioned observing obfuscation techniques between EMOTET and
URSNIF/GOZI-ISFB.
BitPaymer
This ransomware was used to target medical institutions via remote desktop protocol and
other email-related techniques, momentarily shutting down routine services for a high
ransom. Security researchers later published evidence that not only was DRIDEX dropping
BitPaymer, but that it also came from the same cybercriminal group.
During our analysis, we found evidence that the malware families identified had shared
loaders: the overview of the payload decryption procedure, and the loaders’ internal data
structure. While the first figure of the disassembled PE packers had small differences in their
arithmetic operations’ instructions, we found that the four payload decryption procedures
were identical in data structures’ overview on the way they decrypted the actual PE
payloads.

Further analysis also revealed that the internal data structure of the four malware families
were the same. We compared the disassembled codes from the samples we had and
noticed the encrypted payload address and size placed into the decryption procedure located
at offset 0x34 and 0x38.

Figure 3. Identical data structures show similar payload addresses and sizes.

Figure 4. Data structure used by the shared loader.
As cybercrime organizational structures in some countries tend to compartmentalize work,
we suspect that the four malware families’ gangs might be in contact with the same weapon
providers for PE loaders. In addition, it’s also possible that these four cybercrime groups may
establish some attributional – working or otherwise – relationships and have exchanged or
continue to exchange resources.
In our history of monitoring botnets and the underground organizations who make and/or use
them, the cybercriminals behind EMOTET may be sharing to collaborate with trusted, highlyskilled cybercriminal groups, and may be a sign of these four groups’ ongoing and intriguing
relationship.
Alliances like these could lead to more destructive malware deployments in the future. More
than ever, it is important for organizations to heighten cybersecurity preventive measures,
such as establishing policies and procedures for handling security threats. Regular education
awareness sessions and reminders for employees can help protect the enterprise from
attacks and intrusions from malicious emails and URLs. Installing and updating a multilayered protection and solution in preventing online banking threats can go a long way in
securing businesses.
