Regardless of a cybersecurity role in your organization, whether you are a SOC analyst,
threat hunter, or CISO, the more you know about the threat landscape relevant to your
business and region the better you can protect your assets. But when it comes to
ransomware, any big organization can be a target, and you should always be on guard.
Especially, given that the major cybercrime trend of 2020 is Big Game Hunting.
More and more players join the game, disrupting more and more businesses all around the
world. Ransomware itself, as well as attackers' TTPs become increasingly complex, making
detection and analysis really tough. One of such ransomware families, that came into the
game quite recently, but already managed to «lock» quite outstanding victims, such as
Crytek and Barnes & Noble - is Egregor.
Recently Group-IB DFIR team observed Egregor ransomware operators actively using
Qakbot (aka Qbot) to gain initial access, just like it was with Prolock not long ago. The
close similarities in TTPs with earlier ProLock campaigns indicate that Qakbot operators
have likely abandoned ProLock for Egregor.

Egregor has been actively distributed since September 2020. In less than 3 months Egregor
operators have managed to successfully hit 69 companies around the world with 32 targets
in the US, 7 victims in France and Italy each, 6 in Germany, and 4 in the UK. Other victims
happened to be from the APAC, Middle East, and Latin America. Egregor's favorite sectors
are Manufacturing (28.9% of victims) and Retail (14.5%).

Egregor victims
Given the increased activity of Egregor operators and the gang's focus on big firms, we
decided to release this "emergency" blog post to help cybersecurity teams identify and hunt
for this threat actor. This blog will dive you into recent Qakbot campaigns, TTPs employed by
the threat actors during their Big Game Hunting operations, and in-depth analysis of Egregor
ransomware.
Recent Qakbot campaigns
In September 2020, Emotet switched back to distributing Trickbot, so Qakbot operators had
to distribute their trojan without its help. To deliver the trojan, Qakbot operators used
malicious Microsoft Excel documents impersonating DocuSign-encrypted spreadsheets, and
still prefer to use so-called "Email Thread Hijacking" technique.

Post-Exploitation
During our incident response engagements, we saw almost identical techniques to those we
saw in attacks involving ProLock ransomware. Once initial access is gained, the threat actors
used AdFind to collect Active Directory information.
Also we've seen the same script to enable comfortable lateral movement - "rdp.bat". It was
used by the threat actors to modify registry and firewall rules to enable connections via
Remote Desktop Protocol.
To compromise the whole network infrastructure, the threat actor used Cobalt Strike – an
extremely popular post-exploitation tool we've seen in almost 70% of incidents involving Big
Game Hunting operations this year.
In some cases, the threat actors also distributed Qakbot through the network via PsExec,
just like in cases with Prolock we observed in the past, they use a file named "md.exe" – that
is the Qakbot binary.
In addition, they used Rclone for data exfiltration – the same masquerading technique was
used, they renamed its binary to svchost.exe and placed it to C:\Windows.
Parts of exfiltrated data are published on Egregor's Data Leak Site (DLS) to prove they not
only locked the victim's network, but also stolen sensitive information:

If the victim refuses to pay, the threat actors publish the whole set of exfiltrated data:

Ransomware deployment
The threat actors used multiple techniques for ransomware deployment, in some cases even
in a single attack, including abusing Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS), WMI
command-line (WMIC) utility and PowerShell remote sessions. It's interesting that the
PowerShell script contains comments in Russian:

Ransomware analysis
We analyzed a sample of Egregor ransomware, which was obtained during one of our
incident response engagements. Egregor is delivered as a DLL, and should be launched via
rundll32 executable with the similar command line:
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\q.dll,DllRegisterServer -password –-mode
After calling the function DllRegisterServer, the next stage will be decoded, decrypted and
executed. This stage is protected using ChaCha8 stream cipher (the key and the nonce are
stored inside the file) and Base64 encoding:

6/12

The next stage is also used as an encryption layer for the final payload, which could be
decrypted only if the correct password is provided as an argument. This password is used as
the key for
HMAC-SHA256, and the input data for HMAC-SHA256 is hardcoded within the program.
After that, 10000 iterations of HMAC-SHA256 are used along with XOR operation to create a
key for Rabbit stream cipher, which will be used to decrypt the final payload:

7/12

The final payload is highly obfuscated with junk instructions and a lot of jump and call
obfuscation is used. We noticed that Egregor obfuscation is very similar to the obfuscation
used in another ransomware - Sekhmet). The string obfuscation is likewise similar to
Sekhmet and even the keys for decrypting the same strings are the identical.
We noticed that the sequence of language checks is very similar to Sekhmet and Maze
ransomware.
The main purpose of the Egregor (unsurprisingly) is to encrypt files. Files are encrypted
using ChaCha8 stream cipher among with RSA-2048 asymmetric algorithm – the same
scheme was used in Sekhmet and Maze ransomware (key and nonce for ChaCha8 are
generated randomly for each encrypted file):

ChaCha8 key and nonce generation in Maze
ChaCha8 key and nonce is encrypted and added to the beginning of the encrypted file.
Local RSA-2048 keypair is generated for each infected computer; the local private key is
encrypted by the public master key and then added to the "technical block" at the end of the
ransom note (this block also contains the number of encrypted files, information about
workstation and domain).
To check if it is able to encrypt file in specific directory, Egregor will try to create a shortcut in
this directory (the name of the shortcut is equal to victim ID, which is generated based on
hardware configuration of the computer). The shortcut is created with the option
FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE, which allows to automatically deleting this shortcut after
the handle is closed.
After all, the ransom note named RECOVER-FILES.txt will be created in each directory with
encrypted files. Here is a template extracted from an Egregor sample:

The largest ransom demand we observed was more than 4 000 000 $ in BTC.
Conclusion

10/12

Tactics, techniques and procedures observed are very similar to those seen in the past
Qakbot's Big Game Hunting operations. At the same time, we see that these methods are
still very effective and allow threat actors to compromise quite big companies successfully.
It's important to note, that the fact many Maze partners started to move to Egregor will most
likely result in the shift in TTPs, so defenders should focus on known methods associated
with Maze affiliates.
General Recommendations
1
If you've detected Qakbot infection in your network, make sure you handle it properly, and
there's no evidence of lateral movement.
2
Make sure your security controls are able to detect and block Cobalt Strike usage.
3
Focus on suspicious RDP connections as well as BITS, wmic and PowerShell abuse.
4
Develop threat hunting capability for your team, so you can reduce attacker's dwell time, and
prevent successful ransomware deployment.
5
Make sure your team has updated cyber threat intelligence information to detect and prevent
human-operated ransomware attacks.
