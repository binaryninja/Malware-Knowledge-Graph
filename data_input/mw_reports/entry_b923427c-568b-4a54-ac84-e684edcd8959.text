Hardcoded version of WinDealer
The hardcoded version of WinDealer probably comes from the built date.
◆ Version format: {Main_version}.{year}.{month+day}
◆ We observed four versions from collected samples:
◆

16.18.1030
◆ 17.19.0505
◆ 18.19.0628
◆ 18.20.1225
◆

Hardcoded version of WinDealer
Before 2016, WinDealer used hardcoded development timestamp string as
mutex string
◆ We use the mutex string prefix to distinguish the backdoor version

Evolution of WinDealer

Evolution of WinDealer

NEW

WinDealer 2008

At first, the malware is designed to collect the sensitive data from
popular messaging application in China. (support 15 command)

WinDealer 2013

In 2013, it supported more spying function. (support 26 command)
The non-exist URL: "http://www.360.cn/status/getsign.asp"

WinDealer 16.18.1030

Since 2016, There’s hardcode version in WinDealer which
contains the feature to steal shadowsocks profile.

WinDealer 17.19.0505

The non-exist URL was changed to "http://www.360.cn/status/getonefile.asp"

WinDealer 18.19.0628

The non-exist URL was changed to non-exist domain:
http://www.microsoftcom/status/getsign.asp, 48 command

Steganography Technique
◆

The malware contains an additional module in the resource “Bitmap”
using steganography technique to evade security products.
◆

The encrypted DLL in res ID:129

WinDealer EXE

Embedded DLL
XOR (10 bytes key)
AES (16 bytes key)

Encrypted BLOB

How to find BLOB and decrypt

The search method is to add 0x3000 bytes from the beginning of the
image, then advances 1 byte at a time and compares the magic hex
pattern to find the desired location.
◆ The embedded DLL is XORed using the 10 bytes key
◆

The functionality of embedded DLL
Export function name

Description

partInitOpt

Mapping embedded functions on VFT for using
from main module as initialization

GetConfigInfo

Mapping embedded malware configuration data
from the DLL

AutoGetSystemInfo

Creating many threads to get infected device
information

Generated victim ID set in a reg key

The victim ID format: MD5(“<MAC address><Physical_Drive_info><username>”)
◆ The malware creates a specific registry key to store the generated victim ID to use
in the next execution.
◆ As a unique hidden trick, the victim ID is not stored raw data, the malware
converts the 4 bytes victim ID to an IP address style.
◆

Collecting host information
Computer name
◆ Username
◆ CPU info
◆ OS version
◆ Network interface
◆ External IP address
◆ User account
◆ Screenshots
◆

C2 communications

◆

Before sending the victim data, the malware will add a custom header to the
data
◆

Interesting features:
◆

Getting victim label from non-exist domain or non-exist URL based on WinDealer version
http://www.360[.]cn/status/getsign.asp
◆ http://www.360[.]cn/status/getonefile.asp
◆ NXDOMAIN: http://www[.]microsoftcom/status/getsign.asp
NEW
◆

◆

C2 anti-tracking mechanism
◆

IP address generation algorithm (IPGA) NEW

Getting victim label from NXDOMAIN

C2 anti-tracking mechanism

Use IPGA (IP Generation Algorithm) to generate a random C2 IP address
when backdoor does not have C2 config
◆ The randomly generated IP will exist within specific IP address ranges
◆

◆

◆

Ex: 113.62.0.0 - 113.63.255.255 or 111.120.0.0 - 111.123.255.255

This mechanism will prevent researchers from tracking down the real C2 IP

In addition, we found old Windows kernel module downloader (2015 ~ 2017)
◆

PDB string: “Z:¥O¥植入相关¥本地溢出¥downexecdriver¥bin¥FAT32.pdb”

◆

◆

We discovered a WinDealer downloader which contains a legitimate domain but the URL path
is non-existing. (DNS hijacking or network hijacking)
User-agent is an unique "BBB," which also appears in WinDealer RAT

TIM.exe

WinDealer

Victim Host

LuoYu

TIM ( a legitimate communication tool) tried to download the WinDealer, qbupd.exe
somehow even though accessing a legitimate destination of updater.
C:¥Users¥<UserName>¥AppData¥Roaming¥Microsoft¥Windows
¥Start Menu¥Programs¥Startup¥qbupd.exe
After created WinDealer on the startup folder, once victim user logged in this host,
WinDealer is executed and sends stolen data over 6999/UDP to backbone router.

YoudaoDict.exe

Victim Host

WinDealer
(version.dll)

LuoYu

YoudaoDict(legitimate tool) tried to download the WinDealer, version.dll, then dllsideloading it and executed embedded dll at the end of June 2021.
AV has detected this version’s WinDealer several times though, due to the
replacement of AV in this organization, the victim host resulted in compromised.

Public info research (Chinese BBS )
Chinese blog post from Feb 2019 describes a WinDealer-related infection and involving an executable
with the same file name (pptv(pplive)_forap_1084_9993.exe) which we’ve observed.

Countermeasures against this campaign
◆

◆

◆

◆

Cyber Hygiene Matters!
◆ Check before clicking links and downloading files
While preventing malware downloads with SIGINT is very difficult,
detecting and dealing with them is relatively easy.

Deployment of AV and continuous its alert monitoring
Firewall implicit denial setting, and in the case of WFH, Windows
Firewall setting is recommended on the host side as well.

Conclusions
◆

◆

◆

LuoYu is increasing its attack scope to companies and users in East
Asia, including Japan (and their branches in China).
Notable TTPs
◆ Arsenals having capabilities to attack multiple platforms
◆ Utilization of popular shared tools (i.e., ShadowPad, PlugX)
◆ Various attack vector such as SIGINT, watering hole attacks, etc.
LuoYu’s evolution throughout 2021 indicates its potential in
developing into a more sophisticated group in the future
