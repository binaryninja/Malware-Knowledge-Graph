Internet Crime Complaint Center

Internet Crime Complaint Center, IC3
The mission of the FBI is to protect the American People and uphold the Constitution of the
United States.
The mission of the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is to provide the public with a reliable
and convenient reporting mechanism to submit information to the FBI concerning suspected
Internet-facilitated criminal activity, and to develop effective alliances with industry partners.
Information is processed for investigative and intelligence purposes for law enforcement and
public awareness.
In an effort to promote public awareness, the IC3 produces this annual report to aggregate and
highlight the data provided by the general public. The quality of the data is directly attributable
to the information ingested via the public interface www.ic3.gov. The IC3 attempts to
standardize the data by categorizing each complaint based on the information provided. The
IC3 staff analyzes the data, striving to identify trends relating to Internet-facilitated crimes and
what those trends may represent in the coming year.
The crime types are described in Appendix I. Additional considerations relating to the crime
types are provided in Appendix III.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Introduction
Dear Reader,
As cyber criminals become more sophisticated in their efforts
to target cyber victims, we must also grow our capabilities to
successfully combat and defeat them. The evolving nature of
Internet crime presents a unique set of challenges, as crimes
often overlap jurisdictional boundaries and perpetrators can
attack from anywhere on the globe. A crucial element to our
mission of identifying, pursuing, and defeating cyber threats
against our nation is the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center
(IC3), which aids citizens by bringing pervasive cyber crimes and
scams to the attention of law enforcement.
The 2015 Internet Crime Report highlights the IC3’s efforts over
the past year, specifically focusing on their efforts regarding Business Email Compromise (BEC)
and Email Account Compromise (EAC) scams and the Operation Wellspring Initiative (OWS).
The IC3 first began tracking complaints describing BEC scams in 2010, with the scams evolving to
include EAC scams in 2015. In 2015, IC3 received over 8,000 complaints related to these threats
with a combined reported loss of nearly $275 million. OWS launched in August 2013 and is
currently active in eight FBI field offices around the country, with the goal of building the cyber
investigative capability and capacity of the state and local law enforcement community. In 2015,
the IC3 provided 165 referrals to Cyber Task Forces (CTFs), which resulted in 39 OWS cases.
We hope the information presented in this report will be of value to you as we work together to
protect our nation and combat these threats.

2015 Internet Crime Report

History of the IC3
In May 2000, the IC3 was established as a center to receive complaints of Internet crime. The
IC3 received its one millionth complaint seven years later, in June 2007, two millionth in
November 2010, and three millionth in 2014. There have been 3,463,620 complaints reported
to the IC3 since its inception. Over the last five years, the IC3 received an average of nearly
300,000 complaints per year. The complaints address a wide array of Internet scams affecting
victims across the globe.

The IC3’s Role in Combating Cyber Crime
In an interconnected world, the IC3 plays a critical role in our nation’s effort to reduce the
amount of economic loss by Internet crime. One can view the IC3’s role in combating Internet
crime as a part of an intricate puzzle. A short description of each piece is provided to explain
how all pieces must work together to effectively address this global issue.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Millions of people in the United States are victims of Internet crimes each year. Only an
estimated 15 percent of the nation’s fraud victims report their crimes to law enforcement. 1
This is just a subset of the victims worldwide. Detection is the first piece of the puzzle and is
the cornerstone of the larger Internet crime picture.
Victims are encouraged and often directed by law enforcement to file a complaint online at
www.ic3.gov. Complainants are asked to document accurate and complete information related
to the Internet crime, as well as any other relevant information necessary to support the
complaint.

2015 Internet Crime Report

In addition to reporting the crime via www.ic3.gov, complainants should take steps to mitigate
further loss. Victims can take actions such as contacting banks, credit card companies, and/or
credit bureaus to block accounts, freeze accounts, dispute charges, or attempt recovery of lost
funds. Victims should be diligent in reviewing credit reports to dispute any unauthorized
transactions and consider credit monitoring services.
The IC3 is well positioned to be the central point for Internet crime victims to report and to
alert the appropriate agencies of suspected criminal Internet activity. The IC3 reviews and
analyzes data submitted through its website, and produces intelligence products to highlight
emerging threats and new trends. Public service announcements (PSAs), scam alerts, and other
publications outlining specific scams are posted to the www.ic3.gov website. As more people
become aware of Internet crimes and the methods utilized to carry them out, potential victims
are equipped with a broader understanding of the dangers associated with Internet activity and
are in a better position to avoid falling prey to schemes online.
One of the largest pieces of the puzzle falls into place when the IC3 aggregates related
complaints to build referrals, which are forwarded to local, state, federal, and international law
enforcement agencies for potential investigation. If law enforcement conducts an investigation
and determines a crime has been committed, legal action may be brought against the
perpetrator. Each and every piece of this puzzle is necessary to assist law enforcement in
stopping Internet crime.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

IC3 Database Remote Access
A remote search capability of the IC3 database is available to all sworn law enforcement
through the FBI’s Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal (LEEP).
LEEP is a gateway providing law enforcement agencies, intelligence groups, and criminal justice
entities access to beneficial resources. These resources strengthen case development for
investigators, enhance information sharing between agencies, and are accessible in one
centralized location.
This web-based access provides users the ability to aggregate victims and losses to substantiate
criminal activity with the office’s area of jurisdiction, and to enhance the development of cases.
The IC3 recently expanded the remote search capabilities of the IC3 database by allowing users
the ability to gather IC3 complaint statistics. A new tab allows users the ability to run city, state,
county, and country reports and sort by crime type, age, and gender. The user can also run
overall crime type reports and sort by city, state, and country. The report results can be
returned as a PDF or exported to Excel. This new search capability allows users to better
understand the scope of cyber crime in their area of jurisdiction and enhance case
development.

2015 Internet Crime Report

Operation Wellspring Initiative
The Operation Wellspring (OWS) Initiative launched in August 2013 with the Salt Lake City FBI
Cyber Task Force (CTF), in partnership with the Utah Department of Public Safety. In 2014,
OWS expanded to Dallas, TX, and San Diego, CA. Currently, Operation Wellspring offices are
active in eight FBI field offices, which include the addition of the New York, NY; Buffalo, NY;
Oklahoma City, OK; Knoxville, TN; and Kansas City, MO, field offices.
OWS key components are:
• Develop a national platform to receive, develop, and refer Internet-facilitated
fraud complaints
• Coordinate with FBI Cyber and Criminal Units
• Market Internet-fraud statistical reporting through CTFs
• Address Internet-facilitated criminal cases, which do not meet most federal
investigative thresholds, by utilizing CTF state and local officers
OWS builds the cyber investigative capability and capacity of the state and local law
enforcement community. The partnership addresses Internet-based fraud schemes which were
not being investigated by state and local law enforcement.
OWS overall objectives are:
• Create cyber intelligence-sharing environments with the FBI CTF as the single
point of contact to state, local, and tribal law enforcement
• Support coordinated investigations and prosecutions of computer intrusion and
cyber crime cases under both state and federal laws
• Develop the cyber expertise and technical capabilities of the state and local
officers through on-the-job, online, and formal training and mentoring
• Develop best practices
• Increase victim reporting to the IC3 through CTF outreach
The IC3 receives, on average, 800 complaints per day, and OWS offers CTFs a consistent
resource to identifying Internet fraud subjects and victims located throughout the world.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Operation Wellspring Initiative continued

In 2015, the IC3 provided 165 referrals to eight CTFs. The CTFs opened 39 OWS investigations
in 2015. Approximately 3,650 individual complaints were provided within the 165 referrals and
the total victim loss associated with these complaints was approximately $55 million 2.

2015 Internet Crime Report

Hot Topics for 2015
Business Email Compromise (BEC)
BEC is defined as a sophisticated scam targeting businesses working with foreign suppliers
and/or businesses that regularly perform wire transfer payments. The scam is carried out by
compromising legitimate business email accounts through social engineering or computer
intrusion techniques to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.
The IC3 began receiving complaints describing BEC scams in 2010. Victims at the time identified
themselves as United States–based businesses which had long-term working relationships with
Asian suppliers. Victims were instructed through spoofed emails, intercepted facsimiles, or
telephone communications to redirect invoice remittance payments. Fraudulent transfers have
gone through accounts in many countries, with a large majority traveling through Asia. The
scam began to evolve in 2013 when victims indicated the email accounts of Chief Executive
Officers or Chief Financial Officers of targeted businesses were hacked or spoofed, and wire
payments were requested to be sent to fraudulent locations. BEC continued to evolve, and in
2014, victim businesses reported having personal emails compromised and multiple fraudulent
requests for payment sent to vendors identified from their contact list. In 2015, victims
reported being contacted by subjects posing as lawyers or law firms instructing them to make
secret or time sensitive wire transfers.
BEC is linked to other types of criminal activity including romance, lottery, employment, and
check scams. Victims of these scams may be used to unknowingly transfer fraudulent funds on
behalf of the perpetrators. In 2015, the IC3 received 7,838 BEC complaints with losses of over
$263 million 3.

Email Account Compromise (EAC)
EAC is a sister scam to BEC. EAC differs from BEC in that it targets individuals or individual
professionals instead of businesses.
EAC is defined as a sophisticated scam that targets the general public and professionals
associated with, but not limited to, financial and lending institutions, real estate companies,
and law firms. As in BEC, subjects use compromised emails to request payments to fraudulent
locations. The EAC scenario has been reported by victims over a long period of time; however,
specific tracking of victims began in July 2015 as BEC subjects began to overlap. Some EAC
complaints were originally categorized as BEC, but have since further been identified as being
3

Loss is based on adjusted loss.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

EAC. In 2015, the IC3 received 281 complaints identified as EAC with losses of over $11
million 4.

Ransomware
Ransomware is a form of malware that targets both human and technical weaknesses in
organizations and individual networks in an effort to deny the availability of critical data and/or
systems. Ransomware is frequently delivered through spear phishing emails to end users,
resulting in the rapid encryption of sensitive files on a corporate network. When the victim
organization determines they are no longer able to access their data, the cyber actor demands
the payment of a ransom, typically in virtual currency such as BitCoin, at which time the actor
will purportedly provide an avenue to the victim to regain access to their data. Recent
iterations target enterprise end users, making awareness and training a critical preventative
measure. In 2015, the IC3 received 2,453 complaints identified as Ransomware with losses of
over $1.6 million4.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

2015 State by State Statistics
In an effort to better equip law enforcement with data specific to their jurisdictions, the IC3
implemented an enhanced reporting program in 2015. Using the new program, the IC3
developed numerous ad hoc reports that can be generated for cities, states, or countries and
crime types. These improvements permit personnel to generate a report on a specific area of
responsibility (AOR), which can be used by the law enforcement agencies to develop a better
understanding of the types of computer-enabled crimes in their jurisdictions.
This section details the types of complaints received by the IC3 for each of the 50 states and the
District of Columbia utilizing the new reporting capabilities. It is based on the total number of
complaints and loss amounts from each state and the District of Columbia when the
complainant provided state information.

Appendix III
Additional Information about IC3 Data
Each complaint is reviewed by an IC3 analyst. The analyst categorizes the complaint according to the
Crime Type(s) that are appropriate. Additionally, the analyst will adjust the loss amount if the complaint
data does not support the loss amount reported. All data in this report is based off of the reviewed and
adjusted loss amounts.
One complaint may have multiple crime types.
Some complainants may have filed more than once, creating a possible duplicate.
All location-based reports are generated based off of information entered when known/provided by the
complainant.
Losses reported in foreign currencies were converted to U.S. dollars when possible.
Complaint counts represent the number of individual complaints received from each state and do not
represent the number of individuals filing a complaint.
Social media and virtual currency alone are not crime types, but are used in conjunction with one or
more of the other crime types. For this reason, they are tracked by the IC3 for trend and reporting
purposes.
