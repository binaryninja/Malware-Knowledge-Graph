Symantec products will protect against attempted exploits of critical
CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability
UPDATE December 20, 2021: The Apache Software Foundation has released a patch for a
third vulnerability in Log4j. Version 2.17.0 of the software was released on December 17
after issues were discovered with the previous release (2.16). Apache said that 2.16 does
not always protect from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation and is vulnerable to CVE2021-45105, a denial of service vulnerability.
UPDATE December 15, 2021: Apache has patched a second vulnerability in Log4j. The
vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) arises from the fact that the fix for the previous vulnerability
(CVE-2021-44228) did not completely prevent exploits in all circumstances.
According to Apache, the vulnerability occurs in certain non-default configurations. It could
permit attackers to “craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a
denial of service (DOS) attack”.
A zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been discovered in Apache Log4j which, if
exploited, could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.
Exploit code for this vulnerability, dubbed Log4Shell, has been shared publicly and multiple
attackers are already attempting to exploit it.
Q: Will Symantec protect against exploit attempts?
A: Yes, Symantec products will guard against exploit attempts and payloads with the
following detections:

Symantec Data Center Security provides a range of protection for server workloads against
this vulnerability:
Prevention policies prevent malware from being dropped or executed on the system
Ability to block or limit LDAP, http, and other traffic from server workloads and
containerized applications using Log4j to internal trusted servers
Prevention policies sandboxing provides protection from remote code execution by
preventing execution of dual use tools, credential theft, and protecting critical system
files and resources
Web-based
WebPulse observed traffic is currently protected for the Log4jShell vulnerability through
normal processes
Q: What is the significance of this vulnerability?
A: Apache Log4j is a java-based logging utility. It is widely used in cloud and enterprise
software services. The fact that an exploit was discovered prior to the creation of a patch
only heightens the severity of the threat.
Q: Has the vulnerability been patched?
A: Yes, users are advised to update to version 2.15.0 immediately. Apache has also
provided mitigation advice for users of earlier versions.
Q: Is this vulnerability being exploited in the wild?

3/4

A: Yes. Exploit code is publicly available and there are multiple reports of exploit attempts. To
date, activity appears to be mainly centered on coin mining botnets but it is only a matter of
time before attackers of all types attempt to leverage this exploit.
