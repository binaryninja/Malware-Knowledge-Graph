Networks in Central Asia

May 14, 2020

Last fall, APT malware intrusions targeting high-proﬁle companies in Central Asia caught our
attention. A few months later, we began working together with fellow malware analysts from ESET
to analyze samples used by the group to spy on a telecommunications company, a gas company,
and a governmental institution in Central Asia. An APT group, which we believe could possibly be
from China, planted backdoors to gain long-term access to corporate networks. Based on our
analysis, we suspect the group was also behind attacks active in Mongolia, Russia, and Belarus.
The group behind the attack frequently recompiled their custom tools to avoid AV detection,
which, in addition to the backdoors, included Mimikatz and Gh0st RAT. This has led to a large
number of samples, with binaries often protected by VMProtect, making analysis more difﬁcult.
The backdoors gave the actors the ability to manipulate and delete ﬁles, take screenshots,
manipulate processes, and services, as well as execute console commands, remove itself, and
more. Further, some commands may have instructed the backdoors to exﬁltrate data to a C&C
server. Infected devices could also be commanded by a C&C server to act as a proxy or listen on
a speciﬁc port on every network interface. The group also used tools such as Gh0st RAT and
Management Instrumentation to move laterally within inﬁltrated networks.

Timeline

Figure 1: Timeline of events related to the tracking of Microcin, and Avast notifying the targeted company

Avast’s and Eset’s antivirus engines blocked the samples used by the APT group prior to it
attracting our attention, as our antivirus engines’ detections are automated.

Attribution & Clusterization
The samples we analyzed contain links to malware samples and campaigns, such as Microcin,
BYEBY, and Vicious Panda, previously described by Kaspersky, Palo Alto Networks, and Check
Point, respectively. The backdoors we found are custom tools that have not previously been
analyzed, as far as we know. The majority of the C&C servers are registered to Choopa, LLC, a
hosting platform that has been used by cybercriminals in the past. A GoDaddy registrar was also
seen early in the campaign, these servers were removed early on.

We suspect the APT group behind these attacks is from China. Gh0st RAT, one of the tools used,
has been known to be used by Chinese APT groups in the past. Similarities in the code used in
the Vicious Panda campaign, (TTPS, especially the use of the RTF Weaponizer in the infection
vector), which is also thought to have come from China, and the code we analyzed, also lead us
to believe the group might be from China. The targeted companies and institutions, as well as the
professional coding point to an APT group.

Throughout our analysis, we stumbled upon the following backdoors. Details on these backdoors
are provided below the complete list of backdoors.

Technical details (pcaudit.bat)
pcaudit.bat is a batch ﬁle that is used to invoke the svchost.exe in order to load the DLL ﬁle for a
given service speciﬁed in the registry. This batch ﬁle is responsible for the backdoor’s
persistence. The contents of the pcaudit.bat script can be found below:

Figure 2: The batch ﬁle that is responsible for the backdoor’s persistence

Technical details (sqllauncher.dll, logon.dll)
Both DLLs, sqllauncher.dll and logon.dll, are primarily used as backdoors. These are installed as
services by the aforementioned batch ﬁle. They both create a log ﬁle under the path:
%COMMON_DOCUMENT%\WZ9JuN00.tmp aggregating errors during the backdoor’s runtime.
Each entry contains an error code, an error message, and a timestamp formatted as “[yyyy-mmdd hh-mm-ss] %error code% %message%”.
If the infected device can’t connect to the C&C server, the malware attempts to determine
whether the trafﬁc is routed through a proxy. This information may be retrieved either from
%WINDOWS%\debug\netlogon.cfg or from the TCP table. After successfully connecting to the

Technical details (logsupport.dll)
Similarly to the previous DLLs, the logsupport.dll is primarily used as a backdoor, but uses a
different C&C server than the other backdoors. Its corresponding log ﬁle is located at
%TEMP%\rar%[A-Z0-9]{4}%.tmp. The structure of the log ﬁle is also the same. The main
difference is that the log ﬁle is encrypted by a XOR cipher with a hardcoded key.

Figure 3: Log ﬁle is decrypted by a XOR cipher with a hardcoded key

This backdoor checks whether the malware is running in a virtualized environment. Additionally,
the DLL ﬁngerprints the infected device (NETBIOS name, IP address, username, OS version,
MAC address and RAM usage, OEM code page, token information, number of CPU cores,
is64bit), and sends this information to the C&C server.
The communication with the C&C server is encrypted by a simple stream cipher. If the malware
fails to establish an encrypted channel, it checks whether a proxy is being used, using different
methods than the previous two DLLs. It tries to connect to http://www.google.com/index.asp and
retrieve information about a possible proxy from the connection, and it also checks the value of
ProxyServer in the Windows registry key:
HKLM\Software\Microsft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings.
Based on what we saw in the code, the backdoor is also capable of accepting various commands
from the C&C server. These commands allow the backdoor to manipulate ﬁles (move, read,
delete, check existence), manipulate processes (create, terminate, retrieve parent, and process
ID) and Windows services (start, stop, check), execute console commands, remove itself, and
more. Some of these commands (read/check ﬁle, check services, check processes) also send
data back to C&C. The infected device can also be commanded by C&C to act as a proxy or
listen on a speciﬁc port on every network interface.
Interestingly, the backdoor has a set of commands speciﬁcally targeting ﬁles with .tu and .tut ﬁle
extension. These commands may similarly check for their existence, send their content back to
the C&C, and modify their content (append or rewrite by data given by the C&C server).

Mimikatz is an open source project by a French security researcher named Benjamin Delpy which
started in 2007. It is a robust tool that exploits various Windows authentication schemes and
dumps credential-related data from a Windows Local Security Account database. For these
reasons it is often misused by a wide spectrum of APT actors such as the Lazarus Group or
Telebots.
The Mimikatz version used in this campaign has a two-stage installation mechanism (installer.exe
installing Yokel64.exe and mktz64.dll), and contains a PDB string
“E:\2018_\MimHash\mimikatz\Bin\mktzx64.pdb”. Calling a mktz64.dll exported function
MktzDumpbyInjection inside our testing virtual machine yields the following output:

#1 domain = MSEDGEWIN10, user = Administrator
,nthash=FC525C9683E8FE067095BA2DDC971889
#2 domain = MSEDGEWIN10, user = IEUser ,
nthash=FC525C9683E8FE067095BA2DDC971889

Lateral Movement via WMI

The lateral movement via WMI is done with a ﬁle that parses its own ﬁlename, which we suspect
uses the following format: “@@<ComputerName>,<UserName>,<Password>,.exe”. Afterwards,
the data described in the ﬁlename is extracted and used to establish a remote console to a
computer identiﬁed by the retrieved name. Afterwards, Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI) is leveraged to set a strict proxy security, leading to the encryption of arguments of each
remote procedure call, and allowing the server to access local resources. Then WMI is used
again to retrieve the Win32_Process class which in turn is used to create a process with given
parameters. At the end, it terminates itself.

Gh0st RAT
3a3b05a08180013a37fbdbe65e3fe017440c1cb34289647ef1f60316964ef6a9
Gh0st RAT is an old well-known backdoor, predominantly associated with East-Asian attackers. It
is commonly assumed that its source code is widely available. Its presence is often indicated by a
ﬁle named rastls.dll, using an export DLL name svchost.dll and containing a string Gh0st. A string
uwqixgze} is used as a placeholder for the C&C domain.
The version we’ve seen in this campaign tries to connect to https://yuemt.zzux[.]com.

Code Similarities
While analyzing one of the ﬁles, we noticed that it has several correlations to the Microcin sample
from 2017, the BYEBY sample from 2017, and Vicious Panda: The COVID campaign from 2020.

conﬁguration data of the ﬁrst backdoor.

Conclusion
Avast reported its ﬁndings to the local CERT team and reached out to the telecommunications
company. We have not heard back from either organization.
Avast has recently protected users in Central Asia from further attacks using the samples we
analyzed. This, along with tying elements of the samples we discovered back to attacks carried
out on other countries, makes me assume the group is still active.
I would like to thank Peter Kalnai from ESET for working with me on the analysis, Lukáš Obrdlík,
and Adolf Středa from Avast for helping me with this research, as well as Alexey Shulmin from
Kaspersky for his support.
