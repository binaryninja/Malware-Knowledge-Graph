Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors are constantly seeking new, more
sophisticated ways to perform their attacks. That is why Kaspersky researchers
monitor how APT groups refresh and update their toolsets. According to Kaspersky’s
quarterly report, the threat landscape saw an increase in attacks against Microsoft
Exchange servers in Q2 2021. In the latest APT 2021 Report, Kaspersky reveals the
details of a unique long-standing operation, ‘GhostEmperor’, which uses Microsoft
Exchange vulnerabilities to target high-profile victims with an advanced toolset and
no affinity to any known threat actor.
GhostEmperor is a Chinese-speaking threat actor that has been discovered by Kaspersky
researchers. It mostly focuses on targets in Southeast Asia, including several governmental
entities and telecoms companies.
This actor stands out because it uses a formerly unknown Windows kernel-mode rootkit.
Rootkits provide remote control access over the servers they target. Acting covertly, rootkits
are notorious for hiding from investigators and security solutions. To bypass the Windows
Driver Signature Enforcement mechanism, GhostEmperor uses a loading scheme involving

the component of an open-source project named “Cheat Engine”. This advanced toolset is
unique and Kaspersky researchers see no affinity to already known threat actors. Kaspersky
experts have surmised that this toolset has been in use since at least July 2020.
“As detection and protection techniques evolve, so do APT actors. They typically refresh and
update their toolsets. GhostEmperor is a clear example of how cybercriminals look for new
techniques to use and new vulnerabilities to exploit. Using a previously unknown,
sophisticated rootkit, they brought new problems to the already well-established trend of
attacks against Microsoft Exchange servers,” comments David Emm, security expert at
Kaspersky.
Besides the growth of attacks against Microsoft Exchange servers, Kaspersky experts also
highlight the following trends on the APT landscape in Q2:
There has been a rise in APT threat actors leveraging exploits to gain an initial foothold
in attacked networks – including the zero-days developed by the exploit developer
‘Moses’ and those used in the PuzzleMaker, Pulse Secure attacks, and the Microsoft
Exchange server vulnerabilities
APT threat actors continue to invest in refreshing their toolsets: this includes not only
the inclusion of new platforms but also the use of additional languages, as seen by
WildPressure’s macOS-supported Python malware
While some of the supply-chain attacks were major and have attracted worldwide
attention, Kaspersky experts also observed equally successful low-tech attacks, such
as BountyGlad, CoughingDown, and the attack targeting Codecov, which signaled that
low-key campaigns still represent a significant threat to security
To learn more about GhostEmperor and other significant discoveries of the quarter, read the
APT trends report Q2 2021 on Securelist. The report summarizes the findings of Kaspersky’s
subscriber-only threat intelligence reports, which also include Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
data and YARA rules to assist in forensics and malware hunting. For more information,

In order to avoid falling victim to a targeted attack by a known or unknown threat
actor, Kaspersky researchers recommend implementing the following measures:
Provide your SOC team with access to the latest threat intelligence (TI). The Kaspersky
Threat Intelligence Portal is a single point of access for the company’s TI, providing
cyberattack data and insights gathered by Kaspersky spanning over 20 years. Free
access to its curated features that allow users to check files, URLs, and IP addresses,
are available here
Upskill your cybersecurity team to tackle the latest targeted threats with Kaspersky
online training developed by GReAT experts
For endpoint level detection, investigation, and timely remediation of incidents,
implement EDR solutions such as Kaspersky Endpoint Detection and Response
2/4

In addition to adopting essential endpoint protection, implement a corporate-grade
security solution that detects advanced threats on the network level at an early stage,
such as Kaspersky Anti Targeted Attack Platform
As many targeted attacks start with phishing or other social engineering techniques,
introduce security awareness training and teach practical skills to your team – for
example, through the Kaspersky Automated Security Awareness Platform

the main threats drivers may face while using them. They found out that more than half
(58%) of these applications use the vehicle owners’ credentials without asking for their
consent. On top of this, one in five of the applications have no contact information,
which makes it impossible to report a problem. These and other findings are published
in the new Kaspersky Connected Apps report.
