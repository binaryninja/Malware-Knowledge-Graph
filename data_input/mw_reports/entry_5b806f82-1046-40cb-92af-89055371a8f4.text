2014 Internet Crime Report

As an intelligence-driven and a threat-focused national security organization with
both intelligence and law enforcement responsibilities, the mission of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is to protect and defend the United States against
terrorist and foreign intelligence threats, to uphold and enforce the criminal laws
of the United States, and to provide leadership and criminal justice services to
federal, state, municipal, and international agencies and partners.
The mission of the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is to provide the public
with a reliable and convenient reporting mechanism to submit information to the
FBI concerning suspected Internet-facilitated criminal activity and to develop
effective alliances with industry partners. Information is processed for
investigative and intelligence purposes for law enforcement and public
awareness.
The mission of the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) is to provide
training, investigative support and research to agencies and entities involved
in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic and high-tech
crime. While NW3C has no investigative authority itself, its job is to help law
enforcement agencies better understand and utilize tools to combat economic
and high-tech crime. NW3C has other sections within its organization, including
Training (in Computer Crime, Financial Crime and Intelligence Analysis),
Research, and Investigative Support Services. NW3C is funded by an annual
congressional appropriation through the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA).

2014 Internet Crime Report

Introduction
2014 was a productive year for the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). On May 10, 2014 at 9:20 AM, the
IC3 received its three millionth complaint online!
In 2014, the IC3 received 269,422 complaints with an adjusted dollar loss of $800,492,073 1. On average,
approximately 22,000 complaints were received each month. Internet crime has become a global issue with the
sophistication of online criminal techniques and overlapping jurisdictional boundaries. The IC3 remains
dedicated to meet the needs of law enforcement worldwide.
The 2014 Internet Crime Report highlights the IC3’s efforts to prevent and reduce the prevalence and impact of
Internet crimes, and reveals at least two budding Internet crime trends. First, the increased use of social media
has provided a quintessential goldmine of personal data for perpetrators. More victims are submitting
complaints documenting how social media was utilized to perpetrate frauds, or indicating the perpetrator
initiated a relationship through social engineering. Second, the emerging popularity of virtual currency has
attracted perpetrators, who are capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of the digital currency systems.
Due to the evolving nature of Internet crime and criminals achieving new levels of sophistication, the IC3 has
developed a more streamlined approach to reviewing, categorizing and analyzing complaints, which allows for
new trends to be recognized more quickly.

1 Method of evaluating loss amounts: The IC3 staff reviewed complaints reporting a loss of greater than $100,000. Analysts

converted losses reported in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. Reported losses greater than $100,000 for which the complaint information did
not support the loss amount were excluded from the statistics.

History of the IC3
In May 2000, the IC3 was established as a center to receive complaints of Internet crime. In June 2007, the IC3
received its one millionth. In November 2010, the IC3 received its two millionth complaint, and in May 2014, the
IC3 reached the three million complaint milestone. Over the last five years, the IC3 received an average of nearly
300,000 complaints per year. The complaints consisted of a wide array of Internet scams affecting victims of all
nationalities, ages, backgrounds, educational levels, and socio-economic levels.

How it Works
In an interconnected world, the IC3 plays a critical role in our nation’s effort to reduce the amount of economic
loss by Internet crime. One can view the IC3’s role in combating Internet crime as a part of an intricate puzzle.

Millions of people in the United States are victims of Internet crimes each year. Only an estimated 15 percent of
the nation's fraud victims report their crimes to law enforcement2, while the IC3 estimates less than 10 percent of
victims file directly through ww.ic3.gov. Detection is the cornerstone of the larger Internet crime picture.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Victims are encouraged by law enforcement to file a complaint online at www.ic3.gov. Complainants are asked
to document accurate and complete information related to the Internet crime, as well as any other relevant
information necessary to support the complaint. In addition to reporting the crime, complainants should take
steps to mitigate further loss. Victims can take actions such as contacting banks, credit card companies and/or the
credit bureaus to block accounts, freeze accounts, dispute charges, or attempt recovery of lost funds. Victims
should be diligent in reviewing credit reports to dispute any unauthorized transactions and consider credit
monitoring services.
The IC3 is well positioned to be the central point for Internet crime victims to report and to alert the appropriate
agencies of suspected criminal Internet activity. The IC3 reviews and analyzes data submitted through its
website, and produces intelligence products to highlight emerging threats and new trends. Public service
announcements (PSAs), scam alerts, and other fraud trend publications are routinely posted to the www.ic3.gov.
As more people become aware of Internet crimes and the methods utilized by criminals, potential victims are
equipped with a broader understanding of the dangers associated with Internet activity and are in a better
position to avoid falling prey to schemes online.
One of the largest pieces of the puzzle falls into place when the IC3 aggregates related complaints to build
referrals which are forwarded to local, state, federal and international law enforcement agencies for potential
investigation. If law enforcement conducts an investigation and determines a crime has been committed, legal
action may be brought against the perpetrator. Each and every piece of this puzzle is necessary to assist law
enforcement in stopping Internet crime

2014 Frequently Reported Internet Crimes
Auto Fraud
The IC3 receives numerous complaints related to auto fraud scams. Although there are variations, the typical
scam involves a consumer finding a vehicle on a legitimate website which is often below market value. The
fraudster claims they must sell the vehicle quickly because they are relocating for work or being deployed by the
military and are in need of money. The criminal refuses to meet in person, will not allow an inspection of the
vehicle, and often attempts to rush the sale. To make the deal appear legitimate, the criminal instructs the victim
to wire full or partial payment to a third-party agent and to fax the payment receipt to the seller as proof of
payment. The fraudster keeps the money but does not deliver the vehicle. See Appendix III for a full breakdown
of the demographics captured for this scheme.

Government Impersonation E-mail Scam
The IC3 receives complaints containing names of various government agencies and high-ranking government
officials being used in spam attacks in an attempt to defraud consumers. In 2014, the IC3 received approximately
16 complaints per day of this type. With an average adjusted loss of approximately $1,450 per complaint, victims
reported losing more than $23,200 in total to this scam every day. Scammers often pose as government or law
enforcement officials to give them an appearance of authority, making it easier to convince unsuspecting victims
to give their personal information. Complaints spoofing the name of Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI
Director James Comey encompass a large part of the government impersonation e-mail scams. It is important to
note government agencies do not send unsolicited e-mails. See Appendix III for a full breakdown of the
demographics captured for this scheme.

Intimidation/Extortion Scam
Intimidation and extortion scams use demands for money or property through undue exercise of authority,
including threats of physical harm, criminal prosecution, or public exposure.
Payday loans, also known as cash advance loans or deferred-deposit check loans, are usually short-term loans
with a high interest rate, and are among the most abundant type of extortion scams reported. The various
organizations offer loans as a quick solution to an individual’s financial problems. The loans can be obtained
with very little paperwork, require no background check, and are often advertised as having no credit
restrictions. Criminals are capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of people in financial trouble.
The payday loan scheme involves receiving a call or e-mail notifying a loan is delinquent and must be paid in full
to avoid legal consequences. The fraudster purports to be a representative of a legitimate agency and claims to be
collecting debts for a specific company. The scammer usually has accurate victim information, including social
security number, dates of birth, address, employer information, bank account numbers, and names and telephone
numbers of relatives and friends. The scammer relentlessly calls or e-mails the victim's home, cell phone, and
place of employment. The scammer refuses to provide any details of the alleged payday loans and becomes
abusive when questioned. Victims are threatened with legal actions, arrests, and in some cases physical violence
if they refuse to pay. See Appendix III for a full breakdown of the demographics captured for this scheme.

Real Estate Fraud
The use of rental scams by fraudsters was prevalent in 2014. Criminals exploit legitimate online ads listing homes
for sale or rent, and repost the ads in an effort to redirect traffic to the subjects. The houses are usually listed
below-market rental rates to immediately attract potential victims. Scammers typically e-mail the victim stating
they have to leave the area quickly due to employment or volunteer work. Some subjects claim they left the
United States for missionary or contract work in another country. Victims are typically instructed to wire funds
through a wire transfer service. Victims may be asked to fill out credit applications and provide personal
identifying information. See Appendix III for a full breakdown of the demographics captured for this scheme.

Confidence Fraud/Romance Scam
In 2014, the IC3 received numerous complaints regarding confidence fraud and romance scams where the subject
assumed the identities of military personnel. These schemes involve scammers pretending to seek
companionship or romance online. Victims of these scams believe they are in a relationship with someone who is
honest and trustworthy without meeting them in person. Criminals search dating websites, chat rooms, and
social media websites for personally identifiable information, and use well-rehearsed scripts to attract potential
victims. The criminals present convincing scenarios involving family tragedies, severe life circumstances, and
other hardships in an attempt to solicit money. See Appendix III for a full breakdown of the demographics

Trends
Social Media: A Popular Platform for Criminals
Over the last decade, the growth and popularity of social media has increased. Social media has revolutionized
the way people interact with others and has become an integral part of life for people of all ages. Criminals have
exploited social media by phishing for unwary users to fall victim to their scams. The IC3 complaint data shows
12% of the complaints submitted in 2014 contained a social media aspect. Complaints involving social media
have quadrupled over the last five years. In most cases, victim’s personal information was exploited through
compromised accounts or social engineering.

Some of the fraudulent methods identified by the IC3 include:


Click-jacking - Concealing hyperlinks beneath legitimate clickable content which, when clicked, causes a
user to unknowingly perform actions, such as downloading malware, or sending personal information to
a website. Numerous click-jacking scams have employed “Like” and “Share” buttons on social
networking websites. Research other ways to use your browser options to maximize security.



Doxing - Publicly releasing a person’s identifying information online without authorization. Caution
should be exercised by users when sharing or posting information about themselves, family, and friends.



Pharming - Redirecting users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones for the purpose of extracting
confidential data. Type in an official website, instead of “linking” to it from an unsolicited source.

Popular Virtual Currency Schemes
In 2014, virtual currency schemes reported to the IC3 more than doubled from the previous year. Bitcoin,
Litecoin, and Peercoin, just to name a few, are popular types of virtual currencies, also known as CryptoCurrency, which can be used as an accepted form of payment at many online businesses. As this type of currency
becomes more popular, criminals have comprised new ways of capitalizing on this market, bilking millions of
dollars from victims around the globe.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Popular crypto-currency scams reported to the IC3 in 2014:


Victims not receiving their crypto-currency mining equipment or mining contracts after they paid for
them. Crypto-Currency mining is the process of producing crypto or virtual currencies using computers.
Computers are used to solve mathematical equations, generating crypto-coins.



Victims sending high performance computers to crypto-mining datacenters to join others in a mining
pool, only to be scammed by the operators. The losses included damages to computers during transit,
receiving little or no crypto-coins from joining the datacenter pool, or having their computer stolen.



Other victims have reported hacking of their virtual wallets, and then being blackmailed to get their
money back.

With crypto-currency becoming more popular, users need to educate themselves to fully understand the risks of
this type of digital monetary system.

Business E-mail Compromise
The Business E-mail Compromise is defined as a sophisticated scam targeting businesses working with foreign
suppliers and/or businesses which regularly perform wire transfer payments.
The IC3 began receiving complaints describing Business E-mail Compromise scams in 2010. Victims at the time
identified themselves as United States based businesses which had long term working relationships with Asian
suppliers. Victims were instructed through spoofed e-mails, intercepted facsimiles or telephone communications
to change invoice remittance payments to fraudulent locations, usually banks located in Asia. The scam began to
evolve in 2013 when victims indicated the e-mail accounts of Chief Executive Officers or Chief Financial Officers
of a targeted business were hacked or spoofed, and wire payments were requested to be sent to fraudulent
locations, again usually in Asia. The Business E-mail Compromise scam continued to evolve, and in 2014, victim
businesses reported having personal e-mails compromised and multiple fraudulent requests for payment sent to
vendors identified from their contact list.
Business E-mail Compromise is linked to other types of criminal activity including romance, lottery, employment,
and check scams. Victims of these scams may be used to unknowingly transfer fraudulent funds on behalf of the
perpetrators. In 2014, the IC3 received 2,417 Business E-mail Compromise complaints with a total reported loss of
$226 million dollars.

IC3 Database Remote Access
The IC3 has expanded the remote search capabilities of the IC3 database by making it available to all sworn law
enforcement through the FBI’s Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal (LEEP). LEEP is a gateway providing law
enforcement agencies, intelligence groups, and criminal justice entities access to beneficial resources.
This web-based access provides users the ability to aggregate victims and losses to substantiate criminal activity
with the office’s area of jurisdiction, and to enhance the development of cases.

“The IC3.gov website, where the reports are filed,
allows our agency to refer citizens who need to file
mortgage, loan, and debt consolidation reports that
concern our jurisdiction to the IC3 website, rather
than our agency's personnel having to take a report,
freeing up our resources. The "Advanced Search
Options" allows our agency to filter out the above
report types for processing into our agency's internal
reporting system or for consolidation and forwarding
to the District Attorney's fraud unit. The remote query
tool using the Advanced Search Options serves this
function well. We typically run a query on a weekly
basis.”
Ian Horlock
Irvine Police Department

“I can tell you that I did find remote query very useful
in identifying all complaints related to Indiana. On
several occasions, I used a raw IC3 report to generate
a finished intelligence product, which was then used
to open an investigation”
“I think over the past two years we opened at least 9
cases off of IC3 reporting; in one instance it provided
us an opportunity to use an investigative technique
which resulted in the identification of a hacker
located overseas”
Bill Puller

Conclusion
Throughout 2014, the IC3 supported law enforcement in their investigations of Internet-related crimes.
The IC3 used the 269,422 complaints received in 2014 for analysis, and extracted pertinent information to provide
to law enforcement, produced intelligence reports, and published numerous scam alerts and PSAs. The IC3
contributed to the efforts of combating Internet crime by disseminating over 1,500 referrals to law enforcement
agencies. Many of these referral packages included numerous complaints and covered a wide variety of Internet
schemes.
Complaints received and reviewed during 2014, revealed the growing impact social media has had on Internet
crime and the emergence of virtual currency transactions. Additionally, the Business E-mail Compromise scam
emerged as being linked to a myriad of fraud schemes.
The IC3 focused on FBI Cyber Task Forces through Operation Wellspring and saw many successes in 2014. The
IC3 plans to expand this initiative in the coming year to invite additional FBI field offices to participate.

Online Crime Prevention Tips
General Crime Prevention Tips


Be cautious when dealing with individuals located outside the country.



Research individuals to ensure they are legitimate before doing any type of business with them.



Contact the Better Business Bureau to determine the legitimacy and reputation of a company.



Be cautious of businesses which operate from Post Office Boxes or mail drops.



Be cautious of an individual or company, who only accepts wire transfers, pre-paid cards, or cash.



Ensure a website is secure and reputable before entering any personal information.

Phishing/Spoofing/Spam


Be suspicious of any unsolicited e-mail, phone call, or mail requesting your personal information,
including social security number, credit card numbers, and banking information.



Avoid filling out forms in e-mail messages asking for personal information.



Log on to the official website, instead of “linking” to it from an unsolicited e-mail.



Contact the business which supposedly sent an e-mail to verify if the e-mail is genuine.



Don’t open spam. Delete it unread.



Never respond to spam as this will confirm to the sender it is a “live” e-mail address.



Have a primary and secondary e-mail address – one for people you know and one for all other purposes.



Avoid giving out your e-mail address unless you know how it will be used.



Never purchase anything advertised through an unsolicited e-mail.

Credit Card Fraud


Promptly reconcile bank statements to avoid unauthorized charges and monitor for fraudulent activity.



Report unauthorized transactions to your bank or credit card company as soon as possible.



Never give a credit card number over the phone unless you make the call.

Auction Fraud


Before you bid, contact the seller with any questions you have.



Review the seller’s feedback.



Ensure you understand refund, return and warranty policies.



Determine the shipping charges before you buy.



If an escrow service is used, ensure it is legitimate.



Consider insuring your item.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Page 44

Debt Elimination


Obtain the name, address, and telephone number of the individual or company.



Ensure you understand all terms and conditions of any agreement.



Ask for names of other customers of the individual or company and contact them.

Employment/Business Opportunities


Be wary of inflated claims of product effectiveness.



Be cautious of exaggerated claims of possible earnings or profits.



Beware when money is required up front for instructions or products.



Be “leery” when the job posting claims “no experience necessary.”



Do not give your social security number when first interacting with your prospective employer.

Identity Theft


Attempt to obtain a physical address, rather than a Post Office Box or mail drop.



Never throw away credit card or bank statements in usable form.



Be aware of missed bills, which could indicate your account has been taken over.



Review a copy of your credit report at least once a year.

Investment Fraud, Ponzi and Pyramid Schemes


Beware of promises to make fast profits.



Do not invest in anything unless you understand the deal.



Be cautious of investments offering high returns at little or no risk.



Independently verify the terms of any investment which you intend to make.



Research the parties involved and the nature of the investment.

Lotteries


Be leery if you do not remember entering a lottery or contest.



Beware of lotteries charging a fee prior to delivery of your prize.



Be cautious of demands to send additional money to be eligible for future winnings.



It is violation of Federal law to play a foreign lottery via mail or phone.

Nigerian Letter or “419”


Be cautious of individuals representing themselves as foreign government officials.



Beware when asked to assist in placing large sums of money in overseas bank accounts.



Do not believe the promise of large sums of money for your cooperation.



Be cautious when additional fees are requested to further the transactions.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Page 45

Reshipping


Be cautious if you are asked to ship packages to an “overseas home office”.



Be leery if the individual states his country will not allow direct business shipments from the United
States.



Be cautious if the “ship to” address is yours, but the name on the package is not.



Don’t accept packages which you didn’t order.



If you receive packages which you didn’t order, either refuse them upon delivery or contact the company
where the package is from.

Romance Scams


Be cautious of individuals who claim the romance was destiny or fate, and you are meant to be together.



Be cautious if an individual tells you they are in love with you and they cannot live without you, but they
need you to send them money so they can visit you. If you do not send them money or help them, they
will claim you do not love them.



Fraudsters typically claim to be originally from the United States (or your local region), but are currently
overseas, or going overseas, for business or family matters.
