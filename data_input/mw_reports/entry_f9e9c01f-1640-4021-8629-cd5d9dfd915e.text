New Campaign Sees LokiBot Delivered Via Multiple Methods

Introduction
We recently detected an aggressive malware distribution campaign delivering LokiBot via multiple techniques, including the exploitation of
older vulnerabilities. This blog entry describes and provides an example of one the methods used in the campaign, as well as a short analysis
of the payload. We found that one of the command-and-control (C&C) servers had enabled directory browsing, allowing us to retrieve updated
samples.

browsing enabled
Although none of these techniques are particularly new, we want to build awareness about this campaign and encourage users to patch their
systems as soon as possible if they are potentially affected.
Analysis of the Adobe PDF malware delivery mechanism
Some of the delivery methods we found included:
PDF: Using Open Action Object
DOCX: Using the Frameset mechanism
RTF: Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882
Internet Explorer: Exploitation of CVE-2016-0189
Excel: Using embedded OLE Object and Word documents (With further exploitation of old vulnerabilities)
Let’s take a look at one of the delivery methods, an Adobe PDF document attached to an email masquerading as an order invoice email to fool
customers. The PDF file, shown in Figure 2, is named “Revised invoice 2.pdf.”

to the targeted victim
When the document is opened, the user is presented the option to allow or block a connection to a specific host at “192[.]23[.]212[.]137”.

Figure 3. Option

presented to the user upon opening the document
The URL is placed as an action in the PDF “OpenAction” directory, so a web visit is performed when the user opens the document.

If the user allows access to the site, an HTTP request is sent to the URL http://198[.]23[.]212[.]137/document/pdf_r34567888[.]html. The server
responds with a malicious HTML document, shown in Figure 4.

Figure 5. Code snippets from the malicious HTML page returned from server
The malicious web page exploits a vulnerability identified as CVE-2016-0189 to run the embedded PowerShell script.

The credential-stealing payload
After deobfuscation, we can see the malware attempts to download the payload from http://198[.]23[.]212[.]137/regedit/reg/vbc[.]exe.
The payload vbc.exe is a variant of the LokiBot trojan we first detected in 2019. The main purpose of the malware is to steal user credentials
from the web browsers, FTP servers, and SMTP clients. It appears to have been compiled recently and uploaded to VirusTotal.

The importance of timely patching and observing best practices for security
This campaign shows that LokiBot and its variants are still being widely used and still use old and reliable techniques such as social
engineering and vulnerability exploitation as delivery methods.

4/6

Users can protect themselves from campaigns that involve these techniques by observing basic security practices, such as refraining from
clicking links and opening attachments in suspicious or unsolicited emails. Organizations and individuals should also update their systems as
soon as possible since some of the delivery methods discussed in this blog post use vulnerability exploits.
The following security solutions can also protect users from email-based attacks:
Trend Micro™ Cloud App Security – Enhances the security of Microsoft Office 365 and other cloud services via computer
vision and real-time scanning. It also protects organizations from email-based threats.
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector – Defends users through a combination of real-time scanning and advanced
analysis techniques for known and unknown attacks.
