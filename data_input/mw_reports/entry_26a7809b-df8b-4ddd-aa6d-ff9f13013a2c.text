In the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, the underground cybercrime
ecosystem is reshuffling, with ransomware gangs becoming pariahs.
Three hacking forums have now banned ransomware ads, three ransomware leak sites have
gone down, and two other ransomware groups have announced plans to stop operating in
public and go ‚Äúprivate.‚Äù
The news comes after US President Joe Biden hinted last week in press conferences that
the US would take action against ransomware gangs after the Colonial cyberattack shut
down a major pipeline that transported fuel for around 45% of the US East Coast, prompting
the US to trigger a rare state of national emergency.

Hacking forum bans
The first to crack under this pressure were the hacking forums, places where criminal gangs
gather to advertise services, find partners, or share knowledge.
In a post from the site‚Äôs admin calling the ransomware community greedy and toxic, XSS
was the first forum to ban ransomware ads last week.

A day later, the admins of the Exploit forum issued a similar ban, followed a few hours later
by the operators of the RAID forum.

The three sites are today‚Äôs top destinations for most cybercrime groups and where,
historically, ransomware gangs have posted and maintained forum threads advertising their
services and looking for partners.
While XSS and Exploit hosted ads for the larger ransomware gangs, RAID usually hosted
ads for ransomware groups entering the scene, which used the forum to create a reputation
before moving to the larger XSS and Exploit.

Ransomware gangs scatter
But the forum bans on ransomware ads also signaled to ransomware gangs that their
operations had crossed a line, and they reacted accordingly.
The first to go was Darkside, the ransomware gang that orchestrated the Colonial Pipeline
attack. In a message posted on their website, the group said they lost control of some of their
servers and some of the money they gathered from ransom payments.
While it is unclear if the group had servers taken down by US authorities or if the group
performed an ‚Äúexit scam,‚Äù the group has abandoned its operations. Ironically, in a report
published on Friday, security firm AdvancedIntelligence said that even if the Darkside group
tried to stay under the radar more than any other ransomware gang, they failed by hitting the
wrong target in Colonial.
But by that time, the ball got rolling. With the XSS and Exploit bans in place and with
Darkside disappearing, other gangs took the hint.
Hours after Darkside went down, the operators of the REvil and Avaddon ransomware
strains announced major changes to operations. In posts spotted by McAfee‚Äôs John Fokker,
the two ransomware gangs said they planned to stop advertising on forums altogether and
3/5

enter a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù state, where they work with existing partners and through recommendations.
In attempts to avoid pressure from law enforcement, both groups also posted messages
online claiming that they will not attack sensitive social sectors like healthcare, educational
institutes, and the government networks of any country. However, if they‚Äôll stick to these rules
remains to be seen.

But REvil and Avaddon went private because they had a large network of affiliates
(collaborators) with which they could work and continue carrying out attacks.
Smaller groups that didn‚Äôt have similar partnerships didn‚Äôt have this option. So, over the
weekend, two ransomware gangs‚ÄîAko (Razny) and Everest‚Äîappear to have chosen to
shut down.
No, I noticed the extortion site for Everest ransomware go down yesterday, but I wasn't
sure if it was offline or just flaky bulletproof hosting. Yesterday I was getting some weird
Google CAPTCHA stuff for AKO/RANZY, now nothing. I think we have‚Ä¶a thing.

While this reporter was told by several industry sources that there are attempts to take down
some of these group‚Äôs sites, the Ako site shutdown appears to be voluntary, as the gang‚Äôs
former site purposely redirected users to Google rather than go down as the Darkside and
Everest ones.

Ransomware gangs to move into the shadows
Although some ransomware gangs appear to have now ceased operations, things are not,
however, this positive. Security experts fully expect that the individuals behind these
operations to continue operating in the cybercriminal underground.
Even if ransomware ads are now banned, the aforementioned forums also host ads from
‚Äúinitial access brokers,‚Äù which sell access to ‚Äúhacked networks.‚Äù
This is important because, for the past year, ransomware gangs and initial access brokers
have partnered and worked to orchestrate attacks together.
Just because the forums have now banned ransomware ads doesn‚Äôt mean that ransomware
gangs won‚Äôt continue operating on these forums, and they won‚Äôt reach out to initial access
brokers in private and continue their partnerships, as before.
The only thing the ransomware ad ban did was to push ransomware gangs more into the
shadows. They don‚Äôt intend to go away. The monetary rewards are just too big, and further
disruption in their ecosystem is needed, and, as some experts have suggested, more
pressure needs to be applied to the cryptocurrency financial entities that often help these
groups launder their profits.
