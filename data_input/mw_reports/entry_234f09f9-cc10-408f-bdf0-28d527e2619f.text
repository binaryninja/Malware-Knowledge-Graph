ICS-CERT

In 2016, the National
Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration
Center’s (NCCIC) role
within the Department of
Homeland Security’s (DHS)
cybersecurity mission
continued to evolve and
expand. In July, President
Obama issued Presidential
Policy Directive (PPD)-41,
which identifies the Federal
Government’s principles concerning cyber incident
coordination among federal agencies.The directive identifies
the five principles for incident response through three
lines of effort. PPD-41 designates NCCIC as the lead for
asset response, one of the three lines of effort. NCCIC will
respond to an incident at the request of the affected asset
owner to stop the attack, mitigate its affects, and provide
the asset owner with guidance on making its system more
secure. NCCIC will then share anonymized information
about the attack with other asset owners so they can learn
from each incident and better protect their systems.

As we move into a new
year, ICS-CERT continues
unceasingly to combat the
ever-increasing threats to the
CI that provides the important
services Americans rely on
each day in their personal
and professional lives. In this
2016 Year in Review, however,
we pause to look back on
ICS-CERT’s accomplishments
over the past year.

Also this year, NCCIC and the Industrial Control Systems
Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) joined an
interagency team in travelling to Ukraine after cyber attacks
on the country’s power infrastructure. These attacks, which
occurred on December 23, 2015, caused unscheduled
power outages, affecting many Ukrainian power customers.
The team worked with the Ukrainian government to
understand and gain insight about the attacks.
It has been another busy and successful year for NCCIC, and
once again, I am proud of all that they have accomplished.
Moving into 2017, we continue to look for ways to be
more effective in the fight against cyber threats, and we
look forward to continuing the dialogue with our partners
in government, industry, and the critical infrastructure (CI)
community that helps us do so.
Sincerely,
John Felker
NCCIC Director of Operations
Department of Homeland Security

In 2016, ICS-CERT joined with the Federal Protective Services
(FPS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) to
form the Federal Facility Control Systems Security Program
(FFCSSP).This program assesses security in Federal facilities,
with ICS-CERT conducting the cybersecurity portion of the
assessment.The ICS-CERT private sector Assessment team
conducted a cybersecurity assessment at Levi’s Stadium in
advance of Super Bowl 50 and was onsite at the game to
monitor, coordinate, and report any cybersecurity threats
or incidents. In March and April, ICS-CERT and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted unclassified in-person
briefings and online webinars concerning the attacks against
Ukrainian power infrastructure in December 2015.
Overall, this past year, ICS-CERT completed work on 290
cyber incidents, coordinated 305 vulnerabilities, analyzed 100
malware samples, conducted 130 cybersecurity assessments,
released two new versions of the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool
(CSET®), and released a new edition of the Recommended
Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity
with Defense-in-Depth Strategies document. In addition,
ICS-CERT again hosted multiple regional trainings around the
country, including one in Lisbon, Portugal, and two Industrial
Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) meetings, one
in Scottsdale, Arizona, and one in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.
As the threat to the Nation’s CI expands, ICS-CERT continues
to grow to meet each new challenge. I am impressed with
how ICS-CERT has continued its excellent work as our team
continues to expand. I am proud of what the team has
accomplished, and I am sure they will accomplish even more
in 2017.
Sincerely,
Marty Edwards,
ICS-CERT Director

NCCIC
The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration
Center (NCCIC) is a 24x7 cyber situational awareness, incident
response, and management center that is a national nexus
of cyber and communications integration for the Federal
Government, intelligence community, and law enforcement.
The NCCIC shares information among public and private sector
partners to build awareness of vulnerabilities, incidents, and
mitigations.

ICS-CERT
The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response
Team (ICS-CERT) is one of NCCIC’s four branches. (ICS-CERT
works closely with private sector asset owners, vendors, and
government agencies at all levels (Federal, state, local, and tribal)
to protect America’s critical infrastructure (CI) from cyber
attacks.With these entities, ICS-CERT works to coordinates
the sharing of information, services, and tools to help CI asset
owners prevent, mitigate, and recover from cyber incidents and
attacks.The United States depends on CI to support national
defense, economic stability, and public health and safety.
Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-21 identifies 16 CI sectors.
Any disruptions or destruction to CI could be catastrophic for the
Nation. ICS-CERT’s activities include eight main functions. Four
are operations functions, which include situational awareness,
incident response, vulnerability coordination, and technical
analysis.The other four are risk reduction functions, including
cybersecurity assessments, distribution of the Cyber Security
Evaluation Tool (CSET), training, and Industrial Control Systems
Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) activities.

FY 2016 Highlights and Accomplishments
• Assessments: ICS-CERT conducted 130 onsite and
remote cybersecurity assessments across 12 of the 16
CI sectors in 19 states, Washington D.C., and Guam. Of
these 130 assessments, 32 were CSET assessments, 55
were Design Architecture Review (DAR) assessments,
and 43 were Network Architecture Verification
and Validation (NAVV) assessments. In August, the
Assessments team also released its FY 2015 annual
report, NCCIC/ICS-CERT Industrial Control Systems
Assessments Summary Report.
• CSET 7.1 and 8.0: The CSET development team
released two new versions of CSET in 2016. The
team released CSET 7.1 in February and CSET 8.0 in
September. The latest version includes new standards,
a simplified user interface, protected modules, custom
questionnaires, and enhanced network diagramming
window, and additional network components. In FY
2016, ICS-CERT distributed over 10,000 copies of
CSET in 120 countries.
• ICSJWG: This year, the ICSJWG team again hosted
two successful ICSJWG meetings, with a total of 594
attendees.The team hosted the Spring Meeting at the
Chaparral Suites in Scottsdale, Arizona, on May 3–5.
This meeting was the largest to date, bringing together
306 stakeholders from the ICS community.The ICSJWG
2016 Fall Meeting took place on September 13–15 at
Embassy Suites Ft. Lauderdale—17th Street

4

in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. This meeting brought
together 288 attendees. Over the course of each
three-day ICSJWG meeting, the 594 attendees had
the opportunity to network and interact through
demonstrations, presentations, panels, and lightninground talks.
• Incident Response: In FY 2016, the ICS-CERT Incident
Response team completed work on 290 incidents.
The Critical Manufacturing Sector accounted for 63
of these incidents, while the Communications Sector
had 62 and the Energy Sector had 59. Spear phishing
represented 26 percent of these incidents, making
it the leading access vector for ICS-CERT’s FY 2016
incidents. Network scanning and probing accounted
for 12 percent.
• Information Products. In August, ICS-CERT released
the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Industrial Control Systems
Assessment Summary report. In September, ICS-CERT
released the Recommended Practice: Improving
Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defensein-Depth Strategies document and the NCCIC/
ICS-CERT FY 2015 Annual Vulnerability Coordination
Report. In November, ICS-CERT released a Malware
Trends white paper.
• Super Bowl 50 Assessment. ICS-CERT conducted a
cybersecurity assessment at Levi’s Stadium in advance
of Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, California, and the

team was onsite at the Super Bowl 50 Operations Center
monitoring, coordinating, and reporting activities relating
to cyber or communications threats and incidents.
• Technical Analysis: In FY 2016, the Advanced
Analytical Laboratory (AAL) performed in-depth
analysis on 100 malware samples, the results of which
contributed to multiple ICS-CERT alerts and advisories.
Also this year, the AAL has continued modernization
efforts to keep pace with changing technology.
• Training: In FY 2016, 24,350 students registered and
17,773 students completed at least one of the online
courses offered. The Training team hosted regional
training sessions for 1,076 attendees in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Boston,
Massachusetts; and Lisbon, Portugal (conducted
for EUCOM). ICS-CERT Training presented the Red
Team/Blue Team exercise 12 times in FY 2016 and
hosted 506 students. In early April, the Training team
conducted the pilot of an Incident Responder course
and developed a new instructional course for CSET.
The team completed a major systems upgrade to the
Control Systems Analysis Center (CSAC), integrating
additional control system hardware and software into
the Red Team/Blue Team exercise networks.
• Ukraine Action Campaign. After the attacks against
Ukrainian power infrastructure on December 23,
2015, DHS’s NCCIC and ICS-CERT, along with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department

of Energy (DOE), and other Federal agencies, worked
with the government of Ukraine to understand the
attacks. In March and April, ICS-CERT and the FBI
conducted unclassified in-person briefings and online
webinars for asset owners and representatives from
all levels of government to increase awareness of the
threat and provide additional information. The briefing
sessions provided details about the events surrounding
the attack, techniques used by the threat actors, and
strategies for mitigating risks and improving the cyber
defensive posture of an organization.
• US-CERT Portal Migration to HSIN. This year, DHS
consolidated all secure portal capabilities into a single
platform, the Homeland Security Information Network
(HSIN). HSIN is the trusted network for homeland
security mission operations to share sensitive but
unclassified information with streamlined collaboration
and real-time communications throughout all
homeland security mission areas. The US-CERT Portal
(NC4 Mission Center) migrated all content to HSIN
(including the ICS-CERT compartment). This migration
provides significant functionality, features, and
enhanced security, and it enables greater customization
and configuration for the communities (formerly
compartments) that move to HSIN.
• Vulnerability Coordination: ICS-CERT handled 187
vulnerability tickets and coordinated 305 unique
vulnerabilities.

Watch Floor Operations
NCCIC maintains watch floor operations capabilities in
three geographically separate locations: Idaho Falls, Idaho;
Pensacola, Florida; and Arlington,Virginia. NCCIC’s watch
floor operations are the primary entry point for threat,
vulnerability, and incident reporting, as well as classified
and unclassified information dissemination. Watch floor
operations coordinate the interaction between stakeholders
and ICS-CERT by ingesting, triaging, and tracking incidents
to resolution. Watch floor operations coordinate with other
ICS-CERT and NCCIC components, the law enforcement
and intelligence community, and other external partners.
NCCIC’s watch floor operations provide incident response
services, including digital media analysis and onsite
response; recovery and mitigation support; vulnerability
coordination and disclosure; and situational awareness

Idaho National Laboratory
Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is a Department
of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory located
in Idaho Falls, Idaho. When DHS was formed,
Congress directed DHS to utilize the DOE
laboratories, and ICS-CERT has done this for over
10 years in Idaho. DHS ICS-CERT leverages a
significant amount of INL’s top level talent, such
as control systems and cybesecurity expertise
through an Inter Agency Agreement (IAA) with
DOE. INL personnel make up a majority of
ICS-CERT’s overall staff and provide support for
all ICS-CERT functions, as well as hosting one of
the three NCCIC watch floors and the AAL.

alerts and advisories to warn of cyber threats affecting the
Nation’s CI. Other core watch operations functions include
providing input for briefings to senior government officials;
supporting the cybersecurity common operational picture
by providing threat information and analysis inputs; and
leading operational information management processes,
including the operation of ICS-CERT’s incident management
system.
ICS-CERT conducted 10 webinars, 137 presentations,
and 196 teleconferences for stakeholders to help them
understand the threats to CI. At the request of stakeholders,
ICS-CERT published and distributed a document titled Seven
Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems. The
guide highlights strategies that if implemented correctly
could have mitigated all major incidents reported to
ICS-CERT in FY 2015. The document is available on the
ICS-CERT web site.
On December 23, 2015, Ukrainian power companies
experienced unscheduled power outages affecting a large
number of customers in Ukraine. An interagency team
composed of representatives from the NCCIC/ICS-CERT,
U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), DOE,
FBI, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation
(NERC) traveled to Ukraine to collaborate and gain more
insight. The Ukrainian government worked closely and
openly with the U.S. team and shared information to
help prevent future cyber attacks. Although analysis is still
ongoing, the team of both U.S and Ukrainian government
officials has not been able to confirm a causal link between
the power outage with the presence of the malware. In
the wake of this event, ICS-CERT conducted four webinars
and eight presentations describing the events to assist
stakeholders in understanding the event.

ICS-CERT Director Marty Edwards talks with DHS NPPD Under Secretary Suzanne
Spaulding during a visit to the NCCIC watch floor in Idaho Falls, Idaho.

ICS-CERT and NCCIC fall under DHS’s Office
of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C)
and the National Protection and Programs
Directorate (NPPD). NPPD, CS&C, and NCCIC
leadership regularly travel to ICS-CERT’s site at
INL in Idaho Falls, Idaho. In August, ICS-CERT
hosted NPPD Under Secretary Suzanne
Spaulding, the highest ranking DHS official
to visit INL. On these visits, NPPD, CS&C,
and NCCIC leadership meet with the team
and leadership to discuss cybersecurity and
departmental issues and to gain the perspective
of personnel doing ICS-CERT’s cybersecurity
work. These visits also include a tour of
ICS-CERT’s facilities, as well as many of INL’s
non ICS-CERT facilities and capabilities.

Incident Response
Incident response is fundamental to ICS-CERT’s mission
to reduce risk to the Nation’s CI. The Incident Response
team responds to and helps mitigate cybersecurity
incidents affecting industrial control systems (ICS) in
each of the 16 CI sectors across the United States. At
the request of private industry asset owners, ICS-CERT
provides incident response services to assess the extent
of the compromise, identify the threat actor’s techniques
and tactics, and assist the asset owner in developing
strategies for mitigation, recovery, and improving
ongoing cyber defenses.
ICS-CERT also collaborates with international and
private sector Computer Emergency Response Teams
(CERTs) and Computer Security Incident Response
Teams (CSIRTs) to share control systems-related security
incidents and mitigation measures. The coordination
among these partners provides ICS-CERT with a unique
perspective of the overall cyber risk landscape and
emerging threats. ICS-CERT conveys this information
through outreach activities, briefings, and information
products, such as alerts and advisories, as well as
technical information papers recommending strategies
for improving cyber defense.
Every year, adversaries develop increasingly sophisticated
attacks against control system networks. ICS-CERT
provides onsite incident response, conducts technical

8

analysis of artifacts and malware, develops mitigation
strategies for asset owners, and provides configuration
analysis to help detect and prevent evolving threats.
ICS-CERT assists asset owners with tools and services
beyond traditional network monitoring in identifying
potential threat actors present in control system
networks.

Incident Response in FY 2016
In FY 2016, the ICS-CERT Incident Response team
completed work on 290 incidents. The Critical
Manufacturing Sector accounted for 63 of these
incidents, while the Communications Sector had 62 and
the Energy Sector had 59. Spear phishing represented
26 percent of these incidents, making it the leading
access vector for ICS-CERT’s FY 2016 incidents. Network
scanning and probing accounted for 12 percent.
Also in FY 2016, the team responded to the first known
cyberattack to result in physical impact to a power grid.
In another instance, they responded to an incident where
an asset owner found low-level malware with persistent
malicious remote access in its water control system.
Because of these events, ICS-CERT published a number
of alerts and advisories, as well as conducted a national
outreach campaign to share lessons learned and technical
artifacts with critical infrastructure asset owners.

ICS-CERT’s Vulnerability
Coordination Process
1. Detection and Collection,
2. Analysis,
3. Mitigation Coordination,
4. Application of Mitigation, and
5. Disclosure.

Vulnerability Coordination
The primary objective of the ICS-CERT Vulnerability
Coordination team’s work is the timely mitigation of
vulnerabilities to reduce the likelihood of a successful
cyber attack against the Nation’s CI. In this effort,
the Vulnerability Coordination team engages with
Federal, state, local, and tribal governments and with
ICS owners, operators, and vendors in the private
sector.Vulnerability coordination requires technical
expertise and close trusted partnerships with each of
these key stakeholders in the ICS community.
ICS-CERT’s vulnerability coordination process
includes five basic steps (listed above next column).
In the detection and collection step, the Vulnerability
Coordination team collects vulnerability reports
through vulnerability analysis and monitoring
of public sources or they receive vulnerability
information directly from researchers. Upon learning
of a vulnerability, the team eliminates duplicates
and false alarms and they catalog each vulnerability.
In the analysis step, the team works with vendor
analysts to examine the vulnerability and identify all
its potential threats. In the mitigation coordination
step, the team works with the vendor for mitigation
and patch issuance. The Vulnerability Coordination

team allows sufficient time for the vendor to effectively
resolve and perform patch regression testing against any
given vulnerability. In the application of mitigation step,
the team coordinates with vendors to allow sufficient time
for affected end users to obtain, test, and apply mitigation
strategies prior to ICS-CERT’s public disclosure of the
vulnerability. In the disclosure step, after coordinating with
vendors and gathering technical and threat information,
the team publishes an alert or advisory to notify end users
about the vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT strives to disclose
accurate, neutral, objective information. ICS-CERT references
other available information on vulnerabilities and corrects
misinformation when necessary.

Vulnerability Coordination in FY 2016
ICS-CERT handled 187 vulnerability tickets and coordinated
305 unique vulnerabilities. The Vulnerability Coordination
team worked closely with researchers and vendors to
encourage patching of validated vulnerabilities. The
Vulnerability Coordination team also put together two
different research panel discussions for the fall 2016
ICSJWG meeting. The two panels consisted of vulnerability
researchers and medical research companies that provided
different perspectives in the ICS community.

Vulnerability Coordination Case Study from 2016
This past August, NCCIC/ICS-CERT received notice that a remote attacker had used a zero-day exploit against the
maritime transportation sector. The attacker exploited an SQL injection vulnerability in a web-based application
used by multiple U.S. ports that provides real-time access to operational logistics information, resulting in a
loss of valuable data. Once notified of this cyber attack, ICS-CERT issued an alert detailing the vulnerability and
providing mitigation measures. ICS-CERT also contacted the vendor of the application to learn additional details
and the status of a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. ICS-CERT then successfully notified all U.S. ports using the
software and confirmed that they acquired and installed the necessary patch. ICS-CERT also shared the alert with
relevant international partners and encouraged them to install the patch. Thanks to these efforts, the maritime
transportation sector is more secure, resilient, and better prepared to respond to the next cyber attack.

Technical Analysis
ICS-CERT’s Technical Analysis team consists of several groups
working toward a common goal. Technical analysis includes
all aspects of malware analysis; reverse engineering; log
and artifact analysis; long-term analysis exploring systemic
vulnerabilities, potential future threats, tactics, techniques,
and procedures; and other intractable long-term problems.
The AAL performs ICS-CERT’s primary technical analysis
work. The AAL performs most of the malware and artifact
analysis. Primary backup support for the AAL and the
majority of our applied research projects takes place
at Sandia National Laboratory (SNL). We also have an
agreement with and sponsor research by the Air Force
Institute of Technology (AFIT).

Advanced Analytical Laboratory
The AAL provides research and analysis capabilities in
support of ICS-CERT’s incident response, assessment, and
vulnerability coordination activities. The AAL’s expert
cybersecurity researchers perform forensic analysis on
digital media, reverse engineer malware, and respond to
cyber incidents with both onsite and remote capacity. When
possible, the AAL performs analytical efforts remotely in a
laboratory environment using custom tools and techniques.
In some cases, however, onsite analysis is required, and a
team deploys to perform analytical efforts directly on the
owner’s network.

DHS NPPD Under Secretary Suzanne Spaulding presents ICS-CERT’s
AAL team with a DHS NPPD appreciation award.

In FY 2016, the AAL performed in-depth analysis on 100
malware samples. This work helped ICS-CERT to publish
multiple alerts warning the ICS community of the threats
involved and provided information for detecting and
mitigating intrusion activity.
The AAL continues to host summer interns looking for
advanced exposure to ICS security work. This year, the AAL
hosted an intern from the University of Nebraska at Omaha
at its facilities on the Idaho National Laboratory campus in
Idaho Falls, Idaho, providing experience with our malware
analysis and artifact analysis processes. This intern was
also able to participate in a review of Structured Threat
Information Expression (STIX) modernization efforts and a
project to scope an ICS hardware laboratory.

Sandia National Laboratory

Air Force Institute of Technology

Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) performs yearround research work and develops prototype tools on
behalf of the ICS-CERT. In addition, SNL assists the
AAL with malware analysis when requested. SNL’s
recent focus has been on analysis efforts in multiple
data locations within the ICS network space and
visualizing this analysis for responders. These efforts
include the following:

ICS-CERT’s relationship with the Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT) is in its sixth year and continues to expand. In FY 2016,
ICS-CERT supported AFIT’s groundbreaking research program,
including twelve Masters students, one PhD student, and two
faculty researchers dedicated to protecting critical infrastructure.
Highlights for FY 2016 include three journal articles that
seek to improve ICS cyber range capabilities, cyber insurance
modelling for CI owners, and anomaly detection using timingbased side channels for ICS. In addition to the journal articles,
AFIT published two separate peer-reviewed book chapters that
researched organizational structure for cyber first responders
and examined a practical application of ICS honeypot emulation.
Students have also presented their research at the 10th Annual
International Conference on Critical Infrastructure Protection and
the International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security.

• The Process Logic Extraction and Analysis Tool
(PEAT) enables business/process logic verification
through extraction of logic over the network and
“disassembly” of multiple Process Logic formats
into human-readable formats.
• BroBounds simplifies the process of writing
intrusion detection system (IDS) scripts for the
Modbus protocol in the Bro IDS tool by auto
generating the script from choices the user makes
in the interface.

AFIT’s current graduate research efforts include the following:
• Expanding capabilities to evaluate cyber warriors and
defenders,

• Archimedes expands on BroBounds by providing
an interface to the Elasticsearch, Logstash,
Kibana (ELK) stack for simple analysis of Bro
data; visualizations that Kibana cannot perform;
analytics that are too situation-specific for Kibana;
analytics that are capable of machine learning;
and providing the means to write new analytics
on the fly.

• Advancing ICS honeypot research (leveraging proxy
technology) to protect critical assets by surrounding key
components with decoys,

• The Inquisit binary analysis tool received many
performance enhancements for binary analysis of
all types of files, particularly binary comparison
features for use with process logic.

• Anomaly detection for level 0 field devices running 4-20 ma
current loops.

• Enhancing cyber insurance models for CI asset owners,
• Threat intelligence applied to ICS,
• Adapting risk methodologies for medical device protection
within care-giver spaces, and

Assessments
ICS-CERT Private Sector Assessments
As a core part of its mission to reduce risk to the Nation’s
CI, ICS-CERT provides onsite and remote cybersecurity
assessments to CI asset owners and operators to strengthen
the cybersecurity posture of their ICS. ICS-CERT bases its
assessments on standards, guidelines, and best practices
and provides them to CI asset owners and operators at
no cost using our Congressional funding. The assessment
methodology provides a structured framework that asset
owners and operators can use to assess, re-assess, protect,
detect, and continually validate the cybersecurity of their
ICS networks. The information gained from assessments also
provides stakeholders with the understanding and context
necessary to build effective defense-in-depth processes for
enhancing their cybersecurity posture.
ICS-CERT’s private sector Assessment team works with asset
owners to determine which set of assessment services best
fits the needs of that particular organization. The services
provided may include a combination of a facilitated CSET,
DAR, and/or NAVV assessment, depending on the current
state and goals of the organization. The services provided
by the private sector Assessment team are transitioning
from individual CSET, DAR, and NAVV assessments to an
integrated process including all the assessment offerings
along with more advanced analytics to provide improved
actionable feedback to asset owners. The assessment process
includes a baseline assessment using CSET, a deep-dive
design architecture review of the ICS, communications, and
networking architecture, and analysis of the network data
communications. Moving forward, the ICS-CERT Assessment
team is working to include log analysis to the overall
assessment services in FY 2017.
This integrated assessment approach has been evolving in
FY 2016 and has notably found abnormal network traffic
that indicated a potential system breach during several
assessments. On such occasions, the ICS-CERT Assessment
team handed the asset owner over to the ICS-CERT
Incident Response team to provide assistance through the
identification and mitigation process.

Assessments in FY 2016
In FY 2016, ICS-CERT conducted 130 cybersecurity
assessments across 12 of the 16 CI sectors in 19 states,
Washington D.C., and Guam. Of these 130 assessments, 32
were CSET assessments, 55 were DAR assessments, and 43
were NAVV assessments.

In addition, ICS-CERT is supporting broader DHS efforts
by providing assessments for the Regional Resiliency
Assessment Program (RRAP). RRAP is a cooperative
assessment of specific CI within a designated geographic
area and includes a regional analysis of the surrounding
infrastructure. In FY 2016, ICS-CERT conducted 16
cybersecurity assessments with Infrastructure Protection
(IP) in coordination with RRAP.
ICS-CERT is also working to develop the FY 2016 NCCIC/
ICS-CERT Annual Assessment report, which will provide a
year-end summary of ICS-CERT’s private sector assessment
activities to include FY 2016 assessment findings and
observations, as well as highlighting cybersecurity
vulnerabilities and risk mitigation. ICS-CERT will post this
report to its web site once completed.

Federal Facility Control Systems
Security Program
New to FY 2016 is the Federal Facility Control Systems
Security Program (FFCSSP), a joint effort by ICS-CERT,
Federal Protective Services (FPS), and General Services
Administration (GSA), to assess control systems
(building automation) used by government-owned and
leased facilities and occupied by Federal employees for
non-military activities. The Facility Security Level (FSL)
of each facility’s Facility Security Committees (FSC) will
determine the prioritization of these assessments. Facilities
with a security level of 3, 4, or 5 are considered high-risk
facilities and will be ICS-CERT’s top priorities at the onset
of execution and in sustainment of all risk assessment
activities.
The FFCSSP will conduct assessments in Tiers (I, II, and
III), and ICS-CERT will be primarily responsible for
cybersecurity assessments (Tier III). FPS will be responsible
for physical security technology assessments (Tiers I and
II) and GSA for the overall responsibility for supporting
assessments and applying countermeasures. These
assessments involve a comprehensive review of systems and
network architectures and encompass topology verification,
operational processes, communication protocols, evaluation
of security controls, and other areas related to the control
system. These assessments also offer detailed mitigation
plans and recommendations; FFCSSP will perform them
on the most complex and critical facilities in the portfolio.
Lastly, the assessments will provide Federal tenants and
owner-operators with technical knowledge of their systems
and include plans to address security issues as well as
provide countermeasures and facility risk factors.

CSET®
CSET is a self-contained software tool that runs on a desktop
or laptop computer. CSET provides a systematic, disciplined,
and repeatable approach for evaluating an organization’s
security posture. It does not require connection to the
Internet or to any control system or corporate network.
CSET guides asset owners and operators through a step-by­
step process to evaluate ICS and information technology
(IT) network security practices. CSET’s developers designed
it to focus user time in the areas that are most effective
for conducting a self-assessment. The application contains
a feature-rich network diagramming capability, provides
a comprehensive analysis of the network’s adherence to
industry recognized cybersecurity standards, and produces
executive level, summary, and detailed reports.
ICS-CERT released CSET Version 7.1 in February 2016. This
release included:
• NIST SP800-161—Supply Chain Risk Management
Practices for Federal Information Systems and
Organizations. SP800-161 added additional supply
chain management controls to CSET.
• NERC CIP priority list—Using the NERC Critical
Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Violation Risk Factors,
CSET now provides a priority ranked list of an asset
owner’s NERC-CIP controls.
14

• Enhanced dashboard—The CSET team redesigned
the gaps analysis dashboard to include additional
information, simplified navigation, and improved
access to detail charts.
• Requirements organized by standard—CSET now
presents questions and requirements in the order of
the standard. Users can also now perform text searches
directly on the question screen, as well as sort and
reorder questions based on how they apply to different
standards.
• Custom parameter values—Users can now
enter custom parameter values for standards with
requirements that include parameters and they can
customize and store these parameter values in CSET.

• New network components—The number of
network components is double what it was and now
includes stencils for ICS, IT, medical, and emergency
management radio components.

• Protected modules—Custom private questionnaire
support. The ability for organizations to request that
custom questionnaires be integrated into the tool
enabled by a protected key.

ICS-CERT released CSET Version 8.0 in September 2016. This
release included:

• Custom questionnaires—Users now have the ability
to create custom questionnaires from any of the
existing CSET Questions.

• Simplified User Interface—Enhanced and additional
assistance to help users select their standards,
determine security assurance levels, and prepare for an
assessment.
• HIPAA—Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, the standard for protecting sensitive
patient data.
• SANS CSC top 20—The Critical Security Controls are a
recommended set of actions for cyber defense.
• CCIs—Control Correlation Identifiers, descriptions
for “singular, actionable statements” that comprise a
security control or security best practice.

• Enhanced network-diagramming window—The
diagramming functionality is now in its own separate
window that provides more screen space and facilitates
working other CSET functions independently.
• Additional network components—New network
components including a System Information and Event
Management System (SIEMS), Windows Update Server
(WUS), Logging Server, Power over Ethernet Switches
and eighteen specialized medical devices.
In FY 2016, ICS-CERT distributed 10,249 copies of CSET in
120 countries.

• NIST SP800-171—A standard designed to protect
controlled unclassified information (CUI) outside the
government.

Training
Training is a fundamental component of any robust
cybersecurity strategy. ICS-CERT supports CI sectors and the
control system community by offering multiple training
courses, ranging in difficulty at numerous locations around
the country and online. ICS-CERT provides these trainings
specifically for the personnel responsible for the oversight,
design, and operation of control systems. All courses are
offered free of charge. In FY 2016, the Training team
updated the online and classroom course materials multiple
times to include the latest data on threats and vulnerabilities
and their appropriate mitigations from cybersecurity
experts. ICS-CERT is currently sponsoring 15 training
courses and developing two more.
ICS-CERT online training courses are as follows:
• Operational Security (OPSEC) for Control Systems
(100W),
• Differences in Deployments of ICS (210W-01),
• Influence of Common IT Components on ICS
(210W-02),
• Common ICS Components (210W-03),
• Cybersecurity within IT and ICS Domains (210W-04),
• Cybersecurity Risk (210W-05),
• Current Threat Trends in ICS (210W-06),
• Current Vulnerability Trends in ICS (210W-07),
• Determining the Impacts of a Cybersecurity Incident
(210W-08),

The 101, 201, and 202 courses are available in combination
at various locations, multiple times per year. Accompanying
hardware and software demonstration systems show
exploits and mitigation tactics in the numerous exercises.
ICS-CERT Training offers the 301 course in Idaho Falls,
Idaho. This course includes a week of hands-on training
featuring a very competitive Red Team / Blue Team
exercise that takes place within an actual control systems
environment.

Training in FY 2016
In FY 2016, 24,350 students registered and 17,773 students
completed at least one of the online courses offered. The
team hosted regional training sessions for 1,076 attendees
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Boston,
Massachusetts; and Lisbon, Portugal. ICS-CERT Training
presented the Red Team / Blue Team exercise 12 times in FY
2016 and hosted 506 students. In early April, the Training
team conducted the pilot
of an Incident Responder
course and developed a new
instructional course for CSET.
The team completed a major
systems upgrade to the CSAC,
integrating additional control
system hardware and software
into the Red Team/Blue Team
exercise networks.

• Attack Methodologies in IT and ICS (210W-09), and
• Mapping IT Defense-In-Depth Security Solutions to ICS
(210W-10).
The Training team designed the 100W course to increase
awareness and provide students the tools to recognize
potential weaknesses in daily operations. The team designed
the 210W series of courses to cover a broad range of topics
related to cybersecurity for ICS. For the most comprehensive
training, trainees should take the courses in order, 210W-01
through 210W-10.
ICS-CERT classroom training courses are as follows:
• Introduction to Control Systems Cybersecurity
(101);
• Intermediate Cybersecurity for Industrial Control
Systems—Part 1 (201), lecture only;
• Intermediate Cybersecurity for Industrial Control
Systems—Part 2 (202), with lab/exercises; and
• Advanced Cybersecurity for Industrial Control
Systems (301), with lab/exercises.

Scottsdale, Arizona ICS-CERT ICSJWG 2016 Spring Meeting

Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group
ICS-CERT established the Industrial Control Systems Joint
Working Group (ICSJWG) in 2009 to enhance collaboration
between ICS stakeholders and to facilitate partnerships
between the Federal Government and private sector in
all CI sectors. The ICSJWG is a principle component of
the Strategy for Securing Control Systems, providing a
coordination group for sharing information and facilitating
stakeholder efforts to manage cybersecurity risk. The
ICSJWG provides a vehicle for the ICS community to
network, collaborate, and share information freely.

ICSJWG Biannual Face-to-Face Meetings
The focal point of the ICSJWG is the biannual face-to-face
meetings.These meetings provide the opportunity for
anyone in the ICS community, newcomers and industry
veterans alike, to network and share information formally or
informally through presentations, panels, training sessions,
demonstrations, and ad hoc discussions among peers.The
face-to-face meetings are unique in that they target the ICS
community and include all sectors, with subject matter
experts from private industry, trade associations, information
sharing groups, academia, and governmental agencies.

2016 Spring Meeting
The ICSJWG hosted the 2016 Spring Meeting at Chaparral
Suites in Scottsdale, Arizona, from May 3–5. This meeting
was the largest to date, bringing together 306 stakeholders
from the ICS community. Over the course of three days,
attendees had the opportunity to network and interact
through demonstrations, presentations, panels, and
lightning round talks.

Highlights of the 2016 Spring Meeting:
• Keynote presentations from:
- Gregory Touhill, Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Cybersecurity and Communications, DHS;
- Frank Grimmelmann, President and CEO of Arizona
Cyber Threat Response Alliance (ACTRA);
- Mark Fabro, President and Chief Scientist of Lofty
Perch; and
- Marty Edwards, Director of ICS-CERT, DHS.
• A hands-on forensics technical workshop that allowed
attendees to learn recommended best practices for
performing hard drive and memory captures on a live
system.

The focus on networking and collaboration is what sets
the ICSJWG meetings apart from a mere conference with
presentations. ICSJWG members consistently give the
face-to-face meetings high
ratings for their relevancy and
value to their professional lives.
ICSJWG meetings are direct
reflection of the ICS community,
and the ICSJWG Program
Management Office (PMO)
strives to continuously improve

Ukraine infrastructure cyber attacks
to elucidate some of the findings of
the group and explain mitigation
techniques and strategies. The
ICSJWG PMO will also look to
explore methods of turning the most
popular presentations from ICSJWG
meetings into webinars, so those
who are unable to attend meetings
in person could enjoy and benefit
from the highest-rated presentations.

The ICSJWG hosted the 2016
Fall Meeting in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, from September 13-15,
at the Embassy Suites Fort
Lauderdale 17th Street hotel.
This meeting brought together
over 288 stakeholders from the
ICS community and over half of
the stakeholders were first-time
attendees.

Highlights of the 2016 Fall Meeting:
• Keynote presentations from:
- Billy Rios, Founder of WhiteScope;
- Joel Langill, ICS Cybersecurity Subject Matter Expert
at AECOM Management Services Group;
- John Felker, Director of Operations, NCCIC, DHS;
and
- Marty Edwards, Director of ICS-CERT, DHS.
• A hands-on technical workshop and training focused
on Network Monitoring of ICS and Google Hacking/
Shodan.
• Plenary panel sessions focused on Vulnerability
Coordination and Research.
• An Ask Me Anything session with Marty Edwards.

ICSJWG Webinars
In addition to the biannual meetings, the ICSJWG sponsors
ad-hoc webinars to address issues that are of concern to ICS
stakeholders. These issues range from technical solutions to
problems to newly found vulnerabilities with corresponding
mitigation techniques. ICS-CERT has also used ICSJWG
resources to produce more technically specific webinars
about relevant and high profile issues that affect the entire
community. As an example, ICS-CERT representatives
conducted a webinar campaign in the aftermath of the

Other ICSJWG Activities
The ICSJWG also provides informational products to the
broader ICS community to raise awareness regarding a
particular issue or to address a specific need. In addition,
the ICSJWG acts as a vehicle for community members to
distribute and receive relevant information from other
stakeholders. The ICSJWG Quarterly Newsletter includes
relevant information from ICS-CERT along with articles and
whitepapers submitted by the community.

The ICSJWG Steering Team
The ICSJWG Steering Team (IST) is composed of the
ICSJWG PMO and select volunteers from the ICSJWG
community. The IST provides guidance for the ICSJWG
and all associated initiatives, with the overall objective of
enhancing and growing the collaborative efforts of the
ICSJWG, thereby leading to an improved security posture
among ICS stakeholders.
IST representatives are drawn from a variety of different
areas in the ICS community, including asset owners,
vendors, state/local government officials, consultants/
integrators, and representatives from industry associations,
academia, and international organizations. These
representatives act as resources and liaisons to the broader
ICS community and bring a wealth of knowledge and
experience to the effort to continuously improve the
ICSJWG and related activities.

Moving Forward
Moving into 2017, ICS-CERT’s activities will continue
unabated as ICS-CERT looks to improve cybersecurity
capabilities and extend services in support of the Nation’s 16
CI sectors. ICS-CERT will continue to share timely and focused
cybersecurity information with ICS stakeholders, and it stands
prepared to meet each new challenge as it comes.
In 2017, the ICS-CERT private sector Assessment team’s
services will continue transitioning from individual CSET,
DAR, and NAVV assessments toward an integrated process
including all the assessment offerings along with more
advanced analytics to provide improved actionable feedback
to asset owners. The team will work with asset owners to
determine which set of assessment services best fits the
needs of that particular organization. ICS-CERT is actively
exploring additional resources that would provide facilitated
CSET assessments so that ICS-CERT can focus on the more
comprehensive integrated assessment activity mentioned.
The team is also working to include log analysis to the overall
assessment services.
The CSET team is planning two new releases of CSET again
next year. These releases will include new standards such as
NIST 800-53 Revision 4, for Information Technology, and
the NERC CIP Version 6 standard for the Energy Sector. In
addition, a new “discoveries” feature based on ICS-CERT
Assessment team onsite visits will provide immediate
vulnerability mitigation recommendations for selected issues
as part of the analysis process. The Vulnerability Coordination
team will be adding additional staff in 2017 to address an
increasing ticket workload, and they will be revising the
format for alerts and advisories to be more concise and easier
to interpret.
Because of high demand, the Training team is planning on
a significant increase in the number of Red/Blue (301)
22

training sessions next year and will be conducting a session
approximately every three weeks beginning in the spring
of 2017. In addition, the number of online training courses
will be increased and enhanced with additional graphics
and exercises. The Training team will continue to conduct
offsite sessions including new venues in the United States
and Europe. They are also working to become an accredited
provider (AP) of continuing education units (CEU) through
the International Association of Continuing Education and
Training (IACET), and they expect to complete the process
in 2017.
The ICSJWG team will be focusing on improving leadership,
coordination, and strategic direction by utilizing the IST
to help expand membership and promote additional
engagement across all critical infrastructure sectors. ICS-CERT
is also looking into additional IST liaison roles, including
representation from the Information Sharing and Analysis
Center (ISAC) community. ICS-CERT is actively working
to identify venues in all 10 designated Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) regions (given the diffuse
nature of the ICS community) for ICSJWG biannual meetings
to increase awareness of ICS security as a whole.
There is no way to know what cybersecurity threats 2017
will bring, but we do know that new threats will emerge.
ICS-CERT will continue into 2017 working tirelessly toward
its mission to reduce risk to the Nation’s CI by strengthening
control systems security and resilience through public-private
partnerships. To stay apprised of what ICS-CERT is doing in
2017, sign up for our GovDelivery service to be notified of
ICS-CERT alerts, advisories, Monitor newsletter, and other
product releases. Users can also sign up for a HSIN account
for access to NCCIC Portal releases and can follow ICS-CERT
