Most recent Russian cyber attack campaigns
APT29 Campaign Targeting European Diplomats with COVID-19 Lures
TLDR: ESET released a report [PDF] in early February stating that in October and November
2021, APT29 launched a spear-phishing campaign targeting European diplomatic missions
and Ministries of Foreign Affairs.
More information: In the spearphishing emails, the APT29 threat actors impersonated the
Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and stated the Iranian embassy will be closed because of
COVID-19. The goal was to target the diplomatic missions of EU countries and a Cobalt
Strike Beacon on compromised systems.

Ukraine DDoS attacks
TLDR: On February 15, 2022, Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Communications and
Information Security reported that the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine
and two of the country's state-owned banks, Privatbank (Ukraine's largest bank) and
Oschadbank (the State Savings Bank), were hit by a “powerful DDoS attack on a number of
information resources.”
More information: The DDoS attacks consisted of three times more traffic than typically
observed, 99% of which were HTTPs requests. The DDoS attacks caused interruptions in the
sites of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces, and made bank customers
unable to login to their online banking accounts. Privatbank's web application firewall (WAF)
was also updated with a traffic geofencing rule, which automatically removed the site's
contents for IP addresses outside of Ukraine and displayed a message reading: "BUSTED!
PRIVATBANK WAF is watching you.”
U.S. and U.K. governments recently linked the DDoS attacks to Russia’s Main Intelligence
Directorate, the GRU. They were able to attribute the attacks because GRU infrastructure
was observed transmitting high volumes of communications to IP addresses and domains
based in Ukraine. Luckily, the direct impact of these attacks are low. Though the availability
of the data was temporarily compromised, the victims were able to quickly restore access
within a few hours and no information was stolen or altered.

Russian Threat Actors Targeting U.S. Defense Contractors

2/22

TLDR: CISA, the NSA, and the FBI released an alert on February 16th that states from at
least January 2020 through February 2022, Russian state-sponsored threat actors have
regularly targeted U.S. cleared defense contractors (CDC) who support contracts for the
Department of Defense (DoD) and the wider U.S. Intelligence Community.
More information: Over this two year period, the threat actors use common tactics, like
spear-phishing, password spraying, and vulnerability exploitation, to gain access to CDC
networks. They were able to maintain persistent access to numerous CDCs, in some cases for
over six months. While having access, the threat actors were observed regularly and
repeatedly exfiltrating emails and data, through which they acquired “unclassified CDCproprietary and export-controlled information.” This gave the Russian actors insight into
U.S. weapons platforms development and deployment timelines, plans for communications
infrastructure, and military technologies, which can be used to inform Russian military and
intelligence strategy.

APT29 Targeting of French Organizations
The French national cybersecurity agency ANSSI (Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des
Systèmes d’Information) revealed that APT29 has been targeting French organizations in a
number of phishing campaigns since February 2021.
The Russian threat actors compromised the email accounts of French organizations and
leveraged the access to carry out spear-phishing campaigns aimed at foreign institutions.
French government entities were also targeted by phishing emails sent from servers
belonging to foreign entities, which were likely compromised by the same threat actor.
APT29 used the spear-phishing emails to deliver a Cobalt Strike implant, and the
infrastructure used in the attacks against French organizations was largely created using
virtual private servers (VPS) from various providers.

Geopolitical
In early December, President Biden and President Putin held a virtual meeting to
discuss ways to defuse the growing military crisis along Ukraine’s borders.
Biden offered Putin the choice between a diplomatic solution and the severe
economic and political consequences that would follow a Russian invasion of
Ukraine, but there was no word of whether Putin had made any commitments.
Twitter removes a network of 16 accounts linked to the IRA that attempted to introduce
a pro-Russia viewpoint into Central African political discourse.
Twitter also removes a network of 50 accounts that attacked the civilian Libyan
government and actors that support it, while voicing significant support for
Russia’s geopolitical position in Libya and Syria.

3/22

In early December, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with President Putin to
discuss defense and trade relations as India has drawn closer to the U.S.
Russia and India also signed a slew of bilateral defense agreements, including
India’s procurement of more than 600,000 assault rifles from Russia.
In mid-December, Russia published draft security pacts, demanding that NATO deny
membership to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet countries and roll back the deployment of
troops and weapons in central and eastern Europe.
The documents also call for a ban on sending US and Russian warships and
aircraft to areas from where they can attack each other’s territory as well as a halt
to NATO military drills near Russia’s borders.
In mid-December, President Putin and President Xi meet in a virtual summit, in which
the two show solidarity in the face of contentions with the West.
Putin states a new model of cooperation has been formed between the countries,
based, among other things, on such principles as non-interference in internal
affairs and respect for each other's interests
In late December, it is reported that U.S. and Russian officials will hold security talks
on Jan. 10 to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and confront
rising tensions over Ukraine

Renewed cyber attack on German parliament
A spokesperson for the foreign ministry in Berlin stated Russia is responsible for a renewed
cyber attack on the German parliament. According to the EU, the attacks targeted "numerous
members of Parliaments, government officials, etc. in the EU by accessing computer systems
and personal accounts and stealing data." Germany’s intelligence service warned in July that
there had been “intensive attacks” by the Ghostwriter group since February, speculating that
it could be preparing for “hack and leak” operations in which information is stolen to be
published later on, either in its original form or doctored.

TinyTurla backdoor
TinyTurla is a “previously undiscovered” backdoor from the Turla APT group that has been
used since at least 2020. This backdoor slips past malware detection systems because it's so
simple. In other words, the backdoor code is extremely simple, but is efficient enough that
it’ll usually fly under the radar. TinyTurla was found to have been targeting the previous
Afghan government as well as deployed on systems in the US and Germany. Researchers
were able to spot the backdoor and attribute it to Turla because the group used the same
infrastructure that it has used in previous attacks.

4/22

TinyTurla is used as a second-chance backdoor to maintain access to the system, even if the
primary malware is removed. It could also be used as a second-stage dropper to infect the
system with additional malware. The threat actors tried to operate under the radar by
installing the backdoor as a service and naming it "Windows Time Service." Sporting the
ability to upload and execute files or exfiltrate files from the infected system, the backdoor
contacted the C2 server via an HTTPS encrypted channel every 5 seconds to check if there
were new commands from the operator.
Turla is pretty well-known and closely monitored by the security industry, but despite all
this, they managed to use this backdoor for almost two years. This can serve as an argument
for the need for network/behavior-based detection, such as IronNet’s IronDefense, which
would have detected the consistent beaconing used in this attack.

FoggyWeb Backdoor
Microsoft discovered a new piece of malware from APT29 - a post-exploitation backdoor
called FoggyWeb. Observed in the wild as early as April 2021, this backdoor is passive, highly
targeted, and capable of remotely exfiltrating sensitive information from a compromised AD
FS server. It can also receive additional commands from a C2 server and execute them on the
compromised server.

APT29 uses FoggyWeb to remotely exfiltrate the configuration database of compromised AD
FS servers, and the backdoor configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic
the structure of the legitimate URIs that the target’s AD FS deployment uses. The custom
listeners passively monitor all incoming HTTP GET and POST requests sent to the AD FS
server from the internet and intercept HTTP requests that match the custom URI patterns
defined by the actor. Microsoft has notified all customers observed being targeted or
compromised by FoggyWeb, as well as has recommended some mitigation tactics.

REvil ransomware gang strikes again
As mentioned in our analysis of the REvil shutdown, in July 2, 2021, the IT management
software developer Kaseya Ltd. learned its VSA (Virtual System Administrator) was victim of
one of the largest ransomware attacks in history. The Kaseya VSA is a common remote
monitoring and management software used by MSPs (Managed Service Providers) to manage
their clients’ systems. Though Kaseya stated that fewer than 60 of its customers were directly
breached, many of Kaseya’s customers provide IT services to other businesses, leading to an
estimated 800 and 1,500 downstream companies across the world being impacted.
This supply chain ransomware attack was carried out by the REvil ransomware gang, which
claimed to have encrypted more than one million systems and demanded $50 million in
ransom for a universal decryptor. REvil is an infamous Russia-based cybercrime syndicate
responsible for several recent notable attack campaigns, including the recent ransomware
5/22

attacks against Quanta Computer, Sol Oriens, Acer, and JBS. Operating under a
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, REvil ranks first among most common ransomware
variants with 14.2% of the total market share.

Influence campaign against the Polish government
In June 2021, the Polish government attributed a recent wave of cyberattacks to Russian
Secret Services in which over 100 email and social media accounts of some of the most
important Polish government officials from various political parties were targeted. Officials
say this was part of a larger campaign that targeted over 4,350 accounts of various Polish
public figures and citizens. The Russian hackers leaked emails and documents (some of
which were reportedly altered) from the email inbox of Michał Dworczyk, the head of the
Chancellery of the Polish Prime Minister’s. Polish officials said the goal of this campaign was
to “hit Polish society and destabilize [the] country.“ These attacks have been attributed to
Russian UNC1151, which is connected to the wider Ghostwriter influence campaign, designed
with the goal of destabilizing politics in Central Europe.

APT 28 / GRU Brute Force Attacks
In July 2021, the NSA, FBI, and CISA released a cybersecurity advisory [PDF] stating that
since at least mid-2019 through early 2021, the GRU (aka APT28 or Fancy Bear) has carried
out widespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force access attempts against hundreds
of government and private sector targets in the US and worldwide. In this ongoing campaign,
APT28 utilizes a Kubernetes cluster to conduct anonymized brute force access attempts
routed through TOR and commercial VPN services. This brute force capability allows the
actors to access protected data - including emails - and acquire account credentials, which
can be used for many purposes, like gaining initial access, establishing persistence, escalating
privileges, and evading defenses.

IronNet analysis of NOBELIUM activity
Microsoft has reported in a blog post that the same group behind the SolarWinds attack,
revealed in December 2020, NOBELIUM, has struck again in the U.S., targeting
about 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organizations.
IronNet analysis:
The exploitation of a U.S. government email supplier by a Russian intelligence agency,
allowing the agency to masquerade as a legitimate U.S. agency, appears to represent an
important shift in Russian behavior.

6/22

While the tactic of using phishing emails to obtain access and install malware on
computers is hardly unique, the decision by the Russian SVR to represent itself as a
legitimate U.S. government agency by exploiting an actual provider of services to the
government demonstrates that Russia remains undeterred when it comes to going after
the United States.
This hack, which Microsoft reports is being conducted by the same players as the
massive SolarWinds hack on U.S. government systems discussed over the past few
months, could provide the Russians with sustained access to (and intelligence on) all
sorts of third parties that the U.S. government works with through the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
This hack once again highlights how the exploitation of an organization in a company
or government agency’s supply chain entity can create risk not only for the company or
agency itself but for its customers and partners as well.
The hack therefore should also focus our attention on the importance — as highlighted
in the Biden Administration’s recent Executive Order — of organizations and their
suppliers working closely together to share cyber threats information and collaborate in
real-time on threats to provide for cyber collective defense of a supply chain.

Despite lacking the national wealth and technological prowess of their Western rivals, the
Russian intelligence services have proven to be one of the shrewdest, most effective — and
potentially most dangerous — threat actors in cyberspace. Indeed, as the latest on the
SolarWinds hack suggests, Russian cyber attacks are a real and present threat. This summary
is very helpful for navigating the whirlwind of news surrounding the
SolarWinds/SUNBURST attack.

Late-stage SolarWinds / SUNBURST activity
Three new pieces of malware being used in late-stage activity have been identified, with
activity seen as early as June 2020. These are tailor-made for specific networks introduced
after the actor has gained access. The threat actor has been observed using stolen creds to
access cloud services like email and storage, as well as, VPNs and remote access tools. The
Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has named the actor behind the attacks against
SolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP malware, and related components as
NOBELIUM.
7/22

GoldMax
This malware was discovered persisting on networks as a scheduled task impersonating
systems management software. The scheduled task was named after the software and
pointed to a subfolder in ProgramData named after that software with a similar executable
name.
Malware is written in Go and acts as a C2 backdoor
The C2 domains are high-reputation and are acquired from domain resellers or
previously compromised domains. This tactic is used for OPSEC purposes because the
purchased domains maintain their original creation date.

Sibot
This dual-purpose malware was implemented in VBScript designed to achieve persistence on
the machine and then download and execute a payload from the C2 server. It reaches out to a
legitimate but compromised website and places itself in system32/drivers.
GoldFinder
This malware acts as a custom HTTP tracer tool that logs the route that a packet traverses to
reach the C2 server.
This malware was written in Go - used a a custom HTTP tracer tool that logs the route
that a packet traverses to reach the C2 server.
When it attempts to reach the hardcoded C2 server, it will continue trying up to 99
times or until the redirects stop and GoldFinder receives a 200 request - whichever
comes first.

SUNBURST tactics, techniques, and procedures
The threat actor used several sophisticated techniques to hide command and control traffic,
such as mimicking SolarWinds’ Orion traffic and leveraging infrastructure providers to
masquerade as trusted geolocated environments.
While one of the distinctive network behaviors associated with SUNBURST that has been
discussed by the cybersecurity community is command and control (C2) using Domain
Generation Algorithm (DGA), it is our perspective at IronNet that this behavior more closely
aligns with DNS tunneling. In fact, our initial detections of the SUNBURST C2 domain in
early Summer 2020 were based upon our DNS tunneling analytic.
More than 18,000 SolarWinds customers downloaded the update that had the SUNBURST
backdoor and were exposed. The actor then chose a much smaller set of companies and
government agencies they wanted to exploit and downloaded a second set of tools and

8/22

compromised those networks.

TTPs from IronNet's SOC and threat researchers here.

Additional high-profile Russian cyber attack examples
Prior to the SolarWinds/SUNBURST attack, Russian cyber attacks have included the
following:
Interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections: These operations illustrated the
reach and power of cyber-enabled influence operations.
Disruption of the Ukrainian power grid in 2015: Russian cyber actors are credited with
the first publicly identified attack on a live power grid, which impacted an estimated
225,000 people.
Intrusions into the U.S. power grid: In 2018, the U.S. publicly accused Russia of
conducting a two year long coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into the U.S. grid.
Targeting of COVID-19 research: In July 2020, the U.S., U.K., and Canada detailed
Russian-driven cyber intrusion campaigns directed against organizations conducting
COVID-19 vaccine development.
With these instances serving as precursors, there is now widespread concern (and mounting
evidence) within the cybersecurity community that Russian hackers are actively developing
deep access into critical infrastructure networks around the globe for the purpose of
executing disruptive or destructive physical attacks (should they be called upon to do so by
regime leadership). In the case of the SolarWinds/SUNBURST attack, the gravity of this
incident has yet to be determined.
Russia also harbors a large proportion of the world’s active cyber criminals. Theft and fraud
appear to be routinely ignored by the Russian authorities, provided the victims reside in
those nations the Kremlin considers its enemies. Putin’s regime offers little help in bringing
these criminals to justice, and may in fact be partnering with them, placing these criminal
actors beyond the reach of many Western law enforcement agencies.
Some of the most notorious actors in the cyber threat landscape have been traced back to
sponsorship by the Russian state. As the digital revolution has accelerated, so, too, has the
Russian cyber attack landscape — hold-over Cold War tactics that evolved to take advantage
of new electronic methods of communication.
Across cybersecurity communities, a deep dive into SUNBURST is ongoing and will yield
additional insights over time. In historical instances, though, strategic Russian interests are
guided by Russia's desire to be recognized as a great power, to protect the Russian identity,
and to limit global United States power. These themes are evident in components commonly
associated with Russian-backed cyber threat campaigns:

9/22

The weaponization of information through disinformation campaigns and propaganda
Attempted interference in democratic processes
Strategic positioning within critical infrastructure, perhaps as preparation for potential
escalation of hostilities with rival nations.

What does the Russian cyber attack threatscape look like?
To summarize the threat at a more tactical level, we have scoured cybersecurity reporting in
order to prepare an overview of cyber threat actors observed more recently, and to which
evidence-based analysis has assigned the likelihood of Russian state-sponsorship as
probable. Each actor is presented with highlights of more notable campaign activity, with
notations on countries and sectors targeted, as well as a mention of behaviors or tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) utilized in order to enable actions on objectives.
Footnotes provide links to further, more detailed, reading.
Who are today’s major Russian adversary groups and what are the main tactics and
techniques of Russian cyber attack campaigns? Let’s take a closer look at some of these
known actors, listed here in order of threat scope and potential:

Ghostwriter
Ghostwriter represents yet another recently identified cyber influence operation likely tied to
the Russian intelligence apparatus. The campaign, which has been active from early 2017
through at least May 2020, has focused on disseminating falsified narratives surrounding
Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland, and their relations with other NATO allies. The fake stories
consistently suggest tensions between the allies or wrongdoing by NATO troops stationed
within the Baltic region.
In addition to the activity attributed to Ghostwriter, the Associated Press reported that
Russian intelligence services were also using several English-language websites to spread
disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic and response in the United States, providing
yet another example of concerted effort by the Russian intelligence services to influence
public opinion within the West.
The actors behind this campaign have successfully compromised legitimate websites
(typically news sites) which they in turn use to post fabricated stories containing false or
divisive narratives surrounding the alliance NATO with a focus on Eastern Europe. Various
cyber personas are then used to amplify and further disseminate the narratives by posting to
blogs, sites allowing user-generated content, or social media. In April 2020, one such fake
letter was even posted to the official website of the Polish War Studies Academy.
The tactics and concepts observed during the Ghostwriter campaign are reminiscent of
Operation Secondary Infektion, an online influence operation uncovered in 2019. Secondary
Infektion was also designed to exacerbate tension between the NATO countries and relied
10/22

upon social media to amplify and distribute fake stories. While there are no technical links
between these two campaigns, the intent and tactics are strikingly similar.

Sandworm Team
In February 2021, an ANSSI report exposed new Sandworm APT attacks targeting IT
companies using Centreon.
In October 2020, the US Justice Department announced the indictment of six Russian men
who are members of the Sandworm Team. The indictment also lists numerous intrusion
campaigns executed by these actors, to include the infamous NotPetya attacks, targeting of
French politicians and government entities during the 2017 elections, and efforts to interfere
in media and government networks in Georgia in 2018 and 2019. These charges also included
the first official acknowledgement by the US government that Sandworm was responsible for
the Olympic Destroyer malware used to disrupt the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in
PyeongChang, South Korea.
In May 2020, the National Security Agency had issued an advisory warning of ongoing
exploitation of a vulnerability in Exim mail transfer agent (MTA) software, which is popular
in Unix and Linux-based systems. The advisory also specifically tied this activity to the
Sandworm Team, whose actions the US government has publicly attributed to the Russian
GRU’s Main Center for Special Technologies (known as the GTsST).
Active since at least 2009, the Sandworm Team is responsible for the first publicly
acknowledged cyber incident that resulted in power outages impacting a civilian population,
occurring in Ukraine in December 2015. The malware used in this attack, BlackEnergy 3,
enabled the actor to gain access to the IT network of a Ukrainian power company, from
which they pivoted to the SCADA portion of the network, giving the actor the ability to
manipulate the Industrial Control System (ICS) — without the need for customized malware
— in order to shut down power in Kiev. This is an often mis-characterized component of the
campaign, likely because the BlackEnergy 2 predecessor to BlackEnergy 3 contained ICS
11/22

targeting components that are not present in BlackEnergy 3. Cybersecurity researchers also
note that “Russian operators, such as Sandworm Team, have compromised Western ICS over
a multi-year period without causing a disruption,” perhaps in order to stage for future
potential Russian cyber attack campaigns.

ELECTRUM
This group is responsible for the CRASHOVERRIDE malware framework (frequently also
referred to as Industroyer), which was the first malware to ever specifically target and disrupt
electric grid operations. In December 2016, Russian cyber attack by these actors manipulated
breakers at a substation in Kiev Ukraine, leading to power disruption and serious damage to
equipment.
ELECTRUM has links to Sandworm as their development group, but it appears that the
understanding of which team actually carried out the attack has evolved over time.
Regardless of the specific threat actor, the behaviors demonstrated are what are important to
understand.

Telebots
Telebots is the group attributed to the NotPetya ransomware outbreak, which is the most
destructive attack in history from a financial perspective, and is reported to be an evolution
of the group or groups responsible for causing the Ukrainian blackouts described in the
previous two sections. In 2018, the security firm ESET identified code linkages between
NotPetya and CRASHOVERRIDE (which they refer to as the Industroyer attack). The
NotPetya attack initially targeted industries in Ukraine after the threat actor was able to
effect a supply-chain compromise of Ukrainian accounting software. The incorporation of the
EternalBlue exploit for SMB in conjunction with the password dumping tool Mimikatz
enabled NotPetya to cripple networks around the globe.

Sandworm Team

Energetic Bear
This group is assessed as the creator of the Havex RAT, which is one of five known ICS
tailored malware families. Energetic Bear campaigns began in 2010 in order to collect
intelligence used for espionage (as opposed to attempting destruction or disruption of
systems) and have continued through at least 2017. The TTPs leveraged by this threat actor
are not unique or particularly novel, but the systematic and deliberate social engineering
strategies employed are. Smaller, less defended companies and subcontractors within the
energy sector have been targeted — likely as a means for the actor, in turn, to target regional
and national-level energy companies and power suppliers.

DYMALLOY
In October 2020, the U.S FBI. and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) released a joint advisory detailing active targeting of U.S. state and local governments
and aviation networks by Berserk Bear actors. While the advisory stated that these intrusion
did not appear to have disrupted any operations within the targeted networks, the group did
successfully exfiltrate data from at least two victims and appeared to be hunting for
information such as network configurations, passwords, and vendor purchasing data.
In Spring 2020, it had come to light that German government authorities had issued an
advisory to critical infrastructure operators in the country indicating that the Russia-linked
Berserk Bear (aka Dymalloy) group had executed “longstanding compromises” within several
German companies. Of note, there were no identified production disruptions within
industrial networks, per German authorities. Instead, the goal of these campaigns appears to
have been to establish persistence within the companies’ IT and/or production / operational
technology (OT) networks, presumably to allow for future operations.
Some researchers attribute the activities of this group to an evolution of Energetic Bear
activity (referring to earlier activity as Dragonfly and later activity as Dragonfly 2.0);
however, Dragos asserts that there are enough technical differences to justify tracking this as
a separate group. This group avoids using custom malware, opting for commodity malware
families that hinder attempts at applying attribution. Crowdstrike reports that this group has
strong ties to Moscow, as targeting aligns closely with likely collection priorities of Russian
intelligence.

APT29
In late July 2021, RiskIQ identified nearly three dozen command-and-control (C2) servers
under the control of APT29 actively serving WellMess and WellMail malware. APT29 uses
WellMess in a highly targeted manner, making signs of the malware and its C2 servers
relatively rare. RiskIQ began their investigation with a tweet mentioning possible IOCs
associated with APT29 and WellMess. RiskIQ found several additional IP addresses and
Certificates that closely matched the pattern found on the original IP address mentioned in
the Tweet. Building on that, RiskIQ was able to link SSL Certificates you can see in the table
on the slide and IP addresses to APT29 C2 infrastructure with high confidence.RiskIQ
assesses with high confidence that these IP addresses and certificates are in active use by
APT29, though they do not have enough information to say how it is being used or who the
targets are.
On July 6th, 2021, it was reported that Synnex — a technology provider for the Republic
National Committee (RNC) — was attacked by Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).
The SVR, also known as APT29 and Nobelium, used Synnex to gain access to high-value
customer applications in the Microsoft cloud environment. However, the threat actors
reportedly did not succeed in accessing sensitive RNC data through the breach.
In July 2020, cybersecurity agencies from the UK, Canada, and the US jointly attributed a
campaign targeting pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions involved in COVID19 vaccine development to APT29, a group widely believed to be operating on behalf of
Russian intelligence services.
The group began its intrusions by conducting basic vulnerability scanning against external IP
addresses known to belong to the target organizations. The group then deployed publicly
known exploits against the vulnerable systems it found, including popular Citrix, Pulse
Secure, and Fortinet devices, among others. The APT29 actors then deployed custom
malware, known as WellMess or WellMail, to execute commands, upload and download files,
and other operational tasks on the victimized systems. Notably, these malicious tools are
designed to work on both Windows and Linux-based systems and support command and
control communications over multiple networking protocols.
This group has operated since at least 2008, collecting intelligence in support of foreign and
security policy decision-making. The primary targets are Western governments and related
organizations, but intrusion attempts have been witnessed across a broad spectrum of
sectors. Notable compromises include the intrusion into the Democratic National Committee
in 2015 and 2016, and intrusions into unclassified networks of a variety of U.S. government
departments.

In August 2020, the FBI and the NSA released detailed analysis of a malware toolset known
as “Drovorub”, which the agencies attributed to a specific military unit within the Russian
General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate’s (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center
(GTsSS), and linked this activity to APT28 and previous private sector research. This
reporting does not speak to the targets or intent of Drovorub’s operators, but appears to be
part of a concerted effort by the US government to publicize and counter Russian cyber
threats.
This espionage-focused group has also operated since at least the mid 2000s, targeting
multiple sectors around the world with special focus on defensive sector
organizations. Multiple governments have attributed the actions of this group to Russian
military intelligence service, and notable operations have targeted organizations such
as the International Olympic Committee, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, and the Democratic National Committee (similar to APT29). Cybersecurity
researchers identify this actor as conducting some of the most far-reaching and sophisticated
Russian cyber attack campaigns to date.

Fxmsp
In May 2019, the hacking collective Fxmsp gained notoriety for reported breaches of three
major antivirus companies.This group targeted intellectual property from each company,
including code base, development documentation, and information on Artificial Intelligence
(AI) modeling for the purposes of offering up this information for sale, as well as selling
network access to victims.

WIZARD SPIDER
This cyber criminal group targets large organizations by deploying Ryuk ransomware via
Trickbot banking malware. Evidence suggests that the ransom demand varies depending on
the size of the targeted organization, and, as of January 2019, the total amount collected by
the group was $3.7 million USD. At the end of 2019, researchers identified that WIZARD
SPIDER continues to add functionality to the Ryuk variants it delivers in order to maximize
the number of systems within a network impacted by file encryption.

Turla
Throughout the first half of 2020, the Turla group was linked to multiple cyber espionage
operations targeting government entities in Europe and the Caucasus. Researchers at ESET
detailed updates to Turla’s ComRAT malware, the heir to the infamous Agent.BTZ, which
was used to target two Ministries of Foreign Affairs and a national parliament. Turla actors
were also linked to a narrowly focused waterhole campaign targeting Aremenian government
officials and politicians and may have been behind an intrusion into the network of the
Austrian foreign ministry.
Researchers have linked activity from this threat group to Moonlight Maze, a massive data
breach of U.S. government classified information in the late 1990s, and one of the first widely
known cyber espionage campaigns in history. Another notable campaign took place in 2008,
when Agent.btz malware infected U.S. government classified networks via infected
removable media. This group is still in active operation today. More recent operations of this
Russian cyber attack campaign and group have been extremely targeted, going through
extensive lengths to fingerprint systems, collecting as much information as possible, before
making a determination as to whether the target is of interest for further operations. One of
the techniques utilized includes attempting to lure visitors of compromised websites to
download fake Adobe Flash updates, an approach utilized by cyber criminals across the
globe.

XENOTIME
This group has been identified as the most dangerous threat actor publicly known, due to its
association with malware known as TRITON, designed to target a specific safety
instrumented system (SIS) within industrial control systems. SIS are hardware and software
controls used to implement safe states in order to avoid adverse safety, health, and
environmental consequences, and, as such, targeting of these systems could lead to loss of
life scenarios. TRITON was discovered at a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia when the
attacker was believed to have inadvertently shut down plant operations after gaining access
to a SIS engineering workstation to deploy the attack framework. Because TRITON malware
samples are now easily discoverable online, the bar has effectively been lowered for other
threat actors to enter the ICS arena.
In October 2020, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Russian Central
Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics, effectively cutting off any US
business or engagement with the research institute and opening the prospect of sanctions
against third party nations that continue to do business with them. The sanctions represent
the first public acknowledgement by the US government of the institute’s connection to the
Triton malware designed to target industrial safety systems, which had been previously
alleged by private sector cybersecurity researchers.

Gamaredon Group

19/22

The Russian-linked threat group “Gamaredon” has conducted a supply chain malware
attacks against Ukraine. Gamaredon, also known as Primitive Bear, has been active since
2013 and has targeted Ukraine in many of its cyber operations before.
Firstly linking the attack to “one of the hacker spy groups from the Russian Federation,”
Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) later confirmed that the supply
chain attack was the action of Gamaredon, sharing IoCs related to the attack, including an IP
address and a domain. Ukraine accuses Gamaredon of attempting to deliver malicious
documents containing macro code designed to install malware on target systems that would
allow the attackers to control the compromised system remotely. The supply chain attack was
targeted at the System of Electronic Interaction of Executive Bodies (SEI EB), which is used
by government organizations to distribute documents to officials.
Of note:
New evidence also suggests the Gamaredon is a hack-for-hire group that provides
services to other APTs in addition to conducting its own separate activity as well.
Gamaredon’s modus operandi takes after that of second-tier APTs that delivers
important information to top-tier, more advanced actors.
What is interesting about this is that Gamaredon lives in a grey middle area between
APTs and crimeware gangs. This brings up debate over whether Gamaredon is an APT
or a crimeware gang. Using TTPs commonly employed in the crimeware world, like
spam emails with malicious payloads and trojanized installers, along with having a
diverse level of targeting, Gamaredon mimics the characteristics of crimeware gangs.
However, its specific interest in Ukraine and lack of efforts to monetize stolen data has
led it to be long considered as an APT.
An increase in activity from this group was observed in Spring 2020, indicating that
Gamaredon, which has been active since at least 2013, is a ongoing threat to the Ukranian
organizations they so brazenly appear to target. The Spring 2020 campaigns were
highlighted by large waves of malicious emails directed against targets’ and the group’s use of
new malware and TTPs.
This group notably conducts espionage and intelligence gathering via Russian cyber attack
strategies in support of Russian national interests, and seems to primarily focus efforts on
Ukrainian national security targets. Cybersecurity researchers have pointed out that this
group’s current activities potentially serve as a testbed for evaluating adversarial response to
TTPs, with the implication that the group could pivot to utilizing these tactics against future
perceived threats beyond Ukraine.

FIN7
The operations of this financially motivated threat group have continued well into 2020,
despite the U.S. Department of Justice announcing arrests in August 2018 of individuals with
ties to the group. This group is known for leveraging Carbanak malware in addition to other
tools, in order to enable the theft of more than 15 million customer credit card records from
victims spanning hundreds of companies in the United States and abroad. FIN7 operators
have engaged in sophisticated social engineering techniques, including actively engaging
targets in back and forth dialogue before sending malicious documents leading to malware
implants.

Russian cyber attack landscape: in summary
Russian cyber operations represent a very real and sophisticated threat to a wide range of
sectors in numerous countries and regions. As the campaigns outlined here illustrate,
Russian intelligence services view corporations, governments, and civil society as viable
targets for espionage and disinformation operations. In many cases, this simply isn’t a fair
fight. The Russia state brings resources to bear that many of the organizations they victimize,
even many nations, cannot match.

21/22

Nearly all of the campaigns discussed here have been active within just the past several
months. Just since May 2020, the U.S. government has publicly attributed multiple distinct
campaigns and toolsets to specific Russia state-sponsored groups. While this is not the first
time the U.S and its allies have “named and shamed” malicious foreign actors, the pace with
which this has occurred is indeed unprecedented. This is not a coincidence. These threats are
not hypothetical, not projected to arrive at some distant date — they are here now.
IronNet technology is designed to level the playing field. Collective Defense presents a unique
opportunity to identify and correlate sophisticated cyber threats, allowing an organization to
rely not only on what they can see within their own networks, but to leverage the
accumulated knowledge of the IronDome community to rapidly discover malicious behavior
across enterprises or sectors.

Fighting back through Collective Defense
At IronNet, we detect Russian cyber attack campaigns like these and other types of
sophisticated cyber attacks through AI-based behavioral analytics and share those
discoveries into our Collective Defense ecosystem. This approach allows Collective Defense
members to get advanced notice on threats impacting their peers that may be headed their
way. This empowers states, sectors, supply chains, companies of all sizes -- and even entire
nations -- to work collaboratively for stronger cyber defense against Russian and other
nation-state level adversaries.
