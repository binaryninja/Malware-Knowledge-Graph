Expanding Knowledge by
Sharing Intrusion Realities

Security practitioners faced a series of challenges in this past
year which forced organizations into uncharted waters. As
ransomware operators were attacking state and municipal networks alongside
hospitals and schools, a global pandemic response to COVID-19 necessitated a
move to remote work for a significant portion of the economy. Organizations had to
adopt new technologies and quickly scale outside of their normal growth plans.
As organizations settled into a new understanding of “normal,” UNC2452, a
suspected nation-state threat actor, conducted one of the most advanced cyber
espionage campaigns in recent history. Many security teams were forced to
suspend wide-ranging analyses around the adoption of remote work policies and
instead focus on a supply chain attack from a trusted platform.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

Nation states taking a cyber espionage approach to COVID research, threat groups
working together to achieve their objectives, exploitation of quickly adopted workfrom-home strategies and a wake-up call for global supply chain compromise –
experiences in 2020 will shape security policies for years to come.
Themes covered in M-Trends 2021 include: :
• 59% of the security incidents investigated by Mandiant last year were initially
detected by the organizations themselves, an improvement of 12% from the prior
year.
• Ransomware has evolved into multifaceted extortion where actors not only
deploy ransomware encryptors across victim environments, but also employ
a variety of other extortion tactics to coerce victims into complying with
demands.
• FIN11, a recently named financially motivated threat group, was responsible for
widespread phishing campaigns, that conducted several multifaceted extortion
operations.
• Pervasive ransomware campaigns drove down the median dwell time as threat
actors sought to capitalize on shifting trends in the workspace and a global
crisis.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

• UNC2452, a suspected state-sponsored group, undertook a broad-scale
espionage campaign after injecting a trojanized DLL into the SolarWinds
Orion build process. Mandiant identified the campaign and worked with law
enforcement agencies and industry partners to protect organizations and
respond to the adversary.
• Mandiant experts observed the use of 63% of MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and
just over a third of techniques observed were seen in more than 5% of intrusions.
• Threat actors took advantage of infrastructure supporting work-at-home with an
increased focus on vulnerability exploitation.
One of the most striking trends for the period of October 1st, 2019 to September
30th, 2020 was the significant reduction in the global median dwell time. At 24
days, this is the first time Mandiant has observed the global median dwell time
dip below one month. While this reduction in dwell time may correlate to better
visibility and response, it is also likely the preponderance of ransomware helped
drive down the time between initial infection and identification.
With the inclusion of all the observations listed above, the addition of new
metrics reported in By The Numbers, the introduction of the named threat
group FIN11, new case studies, and many other topics, M-Trends 2021 builds on
our transparency to continue providing critical knowledge to those tasked with
defending organizations. The information in this report has been sanitized to
protect identities of victims and their data.

Data from FireEye
Mandiant Investigations

The metrics reported in M-Trends 2021 are based on FireEye
Mandiant investigations of targeted attack activity conducted
between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020.
Detection by Source
Internal detection is
when an organization
independently
discovers it has been
compromised.

External notification
is when an outside
entity informs an
organization it has been
compromised.

Organizations continue to improve their ability to discover compromises within
their environments. While M-Trends 2020 noted a drop in internal notifications
for 2019 compared to 2018, Mandiant experts observed a return to organizations
detecting the majority of incidents internally in 2020. Organizations increased
internal incident detection to 59% in 2020—a 12-point increase compared to
2019. This return to organizations detecting the majority of intrusions within their
environments is in line with the overall trend towards increased internal detection
observed over the last decade. It shows a continued dedication to the expansion
and enhancement of organic detection and response capabilities. The increase in
ransomware activity affects this category as well.

Dwell Time
Dwell time is calculated
as the number of days
an attacker is present
in a victim environment
before they are detected.
The median represents
a value at the midpoint
of a data set sorted
by magnitude.

Organizations continue to find and contain adversaries faster than in previous
years. Over the past decade, there has been a marked reduction in median dwell
time, from just over one year (2011) to just under one month (2020).

In 2020, the global median dwell time dropped below one month for the first time.
Organizations are now detecting incidents in only 24 days—more than twice as fast
as 2019. These improvements in detection hold true regardless of the notification
source. Global median dwell time for incidents which were detected internally
dropped to just 12 days and incidents with external notification sources came in at

Global Median Dwell Time Distribution
Globally, organizations are detecting more incidents within the first 30 days of
an intrusion and fewer incidents with a dwell time longer than 700 days. The
distribution of global dwell time continues to show an increased proportion of
incidents with a dwell time of 30 days or fewer. In 2020, 52% of the compromises
investigated by Mandiant experts had dwell times of 30 days or fewer, compared
to 41% in 2019 and 31% in 2018. There were also improvements at the other end of
the spectrum; Mandiant observed a 3% decrease in investigations with dwell times
greater than 700 days.
The overall trends across multiple years could be explained by continued
development and improvement of organizational detection capabilities and an
evolution of the threat landscape.

A major factor contributing to the increased proportion of incidents with dwell
times of 30 days or fewer is the continued surge in the proportion of investigations
that involved ransomware, which rose to 25% in 2020 from 14% in 2019. Of these
ransomware intrusions, 78% had dwell times of 30 days or fewer compared to
44% of non-ransomware intrusions. Mandiant experts also observed that only 1%
of ransomware intrusions had dwell times of 700 days or more compared to 11% of

Median dwell time in the Americas was 3.5 times shorter in 2020 than in 2019.
Companies were detecting incidents internally 3.6 times faster and receiving external
notification of compromises 2.1 times faster.

DAYS IN 2020

In 2020, 27.5% of incidents investigated in the Americas involved ransomware. The
large number of investigations which involved ransomware undoubtedly drove down
the median dwell time. Ransomware incidents in the Americas had a median dwell
time of just three days and accounted for 41% of incidents with a dwell time of 14
days or fewer.

The reduction in ransomware-related incidents was a likely contributor to the
overall increase in median dwell time for APAC.
Adversaries continue to maintain access in compromised organizations in APAC
for extensive periods of time. Consistent with observations in 2019, 10% of
breaches investigated in APAC during 2020 showed dwell times of more than

Industry Targeting
Mandiant has observed that the most targeted industries continue to remain
consistent year over year. The top five most targeted industries in 2020 were
business and professional services, retail and hospitality, financial, healthcare, and
high technology. Over the past decade, business and professional services and
financial have consistently placed in the top five most targeted industries. Overall,
the top targeted industries change little while position in the rankings is somewhat
fluid.

Big Movers
Mandiant experts observed that retail and hospitality organizations were targeted
more heavily in 2020, coming in as the second most targeted industry, compared
to 11th in 2019. Healthcare rose to 3rd most targeted industry in 2020, compared
to 8th in 2019. In the other direction, Mandiant experts observed a decrease in
targeting of entertainment and media which dropped from the most targeted
industry in 2019 to 6th in 2020.

observations about initial infection vectors, adversary operations and victim
environments.

Initial Infection Vector

29%

23%

Phishing

While phishing remains an effective vector for initial compromise, in 2020,
Mandiant observed adversaries leveraging exploits more often than other vectors.
In cases where the initial vector of compromise was identified, evidence of exploits
was found in 29% of intrusions whereas phishing accounted for 23% of intrusions.
Mandiant experts also observed adversaries used stolen credentials or brute
forcing as the initial attack vector in 19% of the investigations. Prior compromise
accounted for 12% of the intrusions in which the initial compromise was identified.

Adversary Operations

36%

Adversaries continue to use intrusions for monetary gain through methods that
include extortion, ransom, payment card theft and illicit transfers. Direct financial
gain was the likely motive for 36% of intrusions and an additional 2% of intrusions
were likely perpetrated to resell access.

In 2020, data theft remained an important mission objective for threat actors. In
32% of intrusions adversaries stole data and in 29% of those cases (9% of all cases)
the data theft likely supported intellectual property or espionage end goals.

Malware Families

A malware family is
a program or set of
associated programs
with sufficient “code
overlap” among the
members that Mandiant
considers them to
be the same thing,
a “family”. The term
family broadens the
scope of a single piece
of malware as it can
be altered over time,
which in turn creates
new, but fundamentally
overlapping pieces of
malware.

21

Malware
Mandiant continually expands its knowledgebase of malware families based
on insights gained from frontline Mandiant investigations, public reporting,
information sharing and other research. In 2020, Mandiant began tracking more
than 500 new malware families. This is on par with the number of newly tracked
malware families compared to the previous year.
Mandiant responds to hundreds of diverse intrusions each year where adversaries
provide organizations with unique challenges. In 2020, Mandiant experts observed
294 distinct malware families in use during investigations into compromised
environments. Of the nearly 300 malware families observed by Mandiant experts
during intrusions, 144 were malware families which Mandiant began tracking in
2020. Adversaries not only use established malware but also continue to innovate
and adapt to be effective in victim environments.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

Malware Families by Category
The malware category distribution remains relatively consistent year over year.
Of the 514 newly tracked malware families in 2020, the top five categories
were backdoors (36%), downloaders (16%), droppers (8%), launchers (7%) and
ransomware (5%).

A malware category
describes a malware
family’s primary purpose.
Each malware family
is assigned only one
category that best
describes its primary
purpose, regardless if
it has functionality for
more than one category.

						
Malware category
Primary purpose
Backdoor

A program whose primary purpose is to allow a threat actor to 		
interactively issue commands to the system on which it is installed.

Credential Stealer

A utility whose primary purpose is to access, copy or steal authentication
credentials.

Downloader

A program whose sole purpose is to download (and perhaps launch) a file
from a specified address, and which does not provide any additional 		
functionality or support any other interactive commands.

Dropper

A program whose primary purpose is to extract, install and potentially 		
launch or execute one or more files.

Launcher

A program whose primary purpose is to launch one or more files. Differs
from a dropper or an installer in that it does not contain or configure the
file, but merely executes or loads it.

Ransomware

A program whose primary purpose is to perform some malicious action
(such as encrypting data), with the goal of extracting payment from the
victim in order to avoid or undo the malicious action.

Other

Includes all other malware categories such as utilities, keyloggers, point of
sale (POS), tunnelers and data miners.

Mandiant experts observed that 81% of newly tracked malware families were
non-public whereas 19% were publicly available. While adversaries do use publicly
available tools and code, the majority of malware families tracked were likely
privately developed or their availability is restricted.

NEWLY TRACKED MALWARE FAMILIES BY AVAILABILITY, 2020

A publicly available tool
or code family is readily
obtainable without
restriction. This includes
tools that are freely
available on the Internet,
as well as tools that
are sold or purchased,
as long as they can be
purchased by any buyer.

19%

81%

A non-public tool or
code family is, to the
best of our knowledge,
not publicly available
(either for free or for
sale). They may include
tools that are privately
developed, held or used,
as well as tools that are
shared among or sold
to a restricted set of
customers.

Most Frequently Seen Malware Families
The top five malware families seen most frequently during intrusions investigated
by Mandiant experts were BEACON, EMPIRE, MAZE, NETWALKER, and
METASPLOIT. BEACON was so prevalent in 2020 that it was observed at nearly a
quarter of all the intrusions Mandiant investigated. Mandiant experts also observed
a lack of cross-pollination with respect to the malware used across incidents.
Just 3.4% of malware families seen during an intrusion were observed at 10 or
more intrusions, and 70% percent of malware families seen were only observed
during a single intrusion.

NETWALKER METASPLOIT

• BEACON is a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike
software platform and commonly used for pen-testing network environments.
The malware supports several capabilities, such as injecting and executing
arbitrary code, uploading and downloading files and executing shell commands.
Mandiant has seen BEACON used by a wide range of named threat groups
including APT19, APT32, APT40, APT41, FIN6, FIN7, FIN9 and FIN11, as well as
nearly 300 UNC groups.
• EMPIRE is a publicly available PowerShell post-exploitation framework that
allows users to run PowerShell agents without the use of powershell.exe.
PowerShell Empire also allows actors to run various types of post-exploitation
modules and make adaptable communications while evading detection.
Mandiant experts track 90 threat groups that have utilized EMPIRE including
APT19, APT33, FIN10, FIN11 and 86 UNC Groups.
• MAZE is a ransomware family that encrypts files stored locally and on network
shares. MAZE can be configured to infect remote and removable drives as well as
send basic system information via HTTP. Mandiant has observed a dozen distinct
financially motivated threat groups leverage MAZE ransomware.
• NETWALKER ia ransomware family capable of deleting volume shadow copies
and encrypting files on a victim host and any mapped network drives using
a combination of SALSA20 and Curve25519 encryption algorithms. Mandiant
tracks eight threat groups that have used NETWALKER ransomware to further
their monetary end goals.
• METASPLOIT is a penetration testing platform that enables users to find, exploit,
and validate vulnerabilities. Mandiant has seen METASPLOIT used by APT40,
APT41, FIN6, FIN7, FIN11 and 40 UNC groups with end goals ranging from
espionage and financial gain to penetration testing.

Operating System Effectiveness
The operating system
effectiveness of a malware
family is the operating
system(s) that the malware
can be used against.

In keeping with previous trends, the majority of newly tracked malware families
were effective on Windows. Only 8% and 3% of newly tracked malware families
were effective on Linux and MacOS, respectively.

Threat Techniques
MITRE ATT&CK® is a
globally-accessible
knowledge base of
adversary tactics and
techniques based on
real-world observations.
The ATT&CK knowledge
base is used as a
foundation for the
development of
specific threat models
and methodologies
in the private sector,
government and the
cyber security product
and service community.

Mandiant continues to support community and industry efforts by mapping its
findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. In 2020, significant changes were made
to the MITRE ATT&CK framework with the introduction of sub-techniques and the
incorporation of PRE-ATT&CK in Enterprise ATT&CK. Due in part to these changes
and the continued refinement of its data model, Mandiant now has MITRE ATT&CK
techniques mapped to more than 1800 Mandiant techniques and subsequent
findings.
When making security decisions, organizations must consider the likelihood of
specific techniques being used during an intrusion. In 2020, Mandiant experts
observed attackers use 63% of MITRE ATT&CK techniques and 24% of subtechniques. However, only 37% of the techniques observed (23% of all techniques)
were seen in more than 5% of intrusions.
In more than half of the intrusions investigated in 2020, Mandiant observed
that adversaries used obfuscation, such as encryption or encoding, on files or
information to make detection and subsequent analysis more difficult (T1027).
Adversaries regularly used a command or scripting interpreter to further intrusions
(T1059) and 80% of those cases involved the use of PowerShell (T1059.001).
System services (T1569) were also a popular execution method, represented in 31%
of intrusions, all of which used Windows services (T1569.002). Adversaries also
used Remote Services (T1021) to further intrusions, with 88% of those using the
Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001). Adversaries often take advantage of what is
available in a victim’s environment; this tendency is highlighted by how frequently
adversaries used PowerShell, Windows services and Remote Desktop.

Ransomware Evolves
Into Multifaceted Extortion

Our understanding of ransomware was appropriate for 2019 but
the way ransomware attacks are conducted today has changed,
resulting in different business consequences and different
protections must be put in place. When business leaders and risk
managers hear “ransomware,” they often envision scenarios of malware encrypting
files, making them inaccessible to legitimate users, and ultimately resulting in
some level of business disruption. They also believe that the best protection
against these sorts of attacks is solid offline backups. Now, however, the problem
is fundamentally different, yet we still refer to the problem as ransomware. This
mischaracterization does not serve organizations well and they are unprepared
when an attack’s true nature is revealed in the midst of a real incident. To
better confront and mitigate these incidents, Mandiant has adopted the term
“multifaceted extortion” to characterize this evolved form of ransomware.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

The Facets of Multifaceted Extortion
Deployment of ransomware encryptors.
The target organization’s files are encrypted and made unavailable. The attacker
demands a payment for the decryption tool and key.

2.

Theft of sensitive data.

3.

Publication of stolen data on a “name-and-shame” website.

The organizations files are stolen and the attacker demands a payment not to
publish the sensitive data. This extortion is much more consequential than the
first and it may give the attacker more leverage. With a multifaceted extortion, the
attacker turns a service disruption into a data breach. Data breaches may have
more serious business consequences than service disruptions. A data breach can
result in greater reputational damage, regulatory fines, class action lawsuits and
derailed digital transformation initiatives. These consequences were typically not
seen with traditional ransomware before 2019. Organizations may not expect such
consequences if they continue to think of modern multifaceted extortion attacks
simply as ransomware.
Many multifaceted extortion threat actors operate such sites on the Tor network.
The actors may engage security and technology media organizations to amplify
their attacks and attempt to coerce victims into paying.
With multifaceted extortion, in addition to deploying ransomware encryptors and
disrupting business operations, the threat actors steal data, publish it and shame
victims. Having good backups only addresses part of the problem.

4.

Additional coercive tactics.
To compel victims into paying extortion demands, threat actors have applied
pressure in various ways:
• Convinced news and media organizations to write stories on victim security
incidents
• Called and harassed employees
• Notified business partners of data theft, creating friction in relationships and
prompting breach disclosures
• Conducted distributed denial of service attacks to further disrupt operations

Disruption and Brand Damage Due to Multifaceted Extortion
Multifaceted extortion continues to be a leading concern for organizations as
threat actors evolve their technology and tradecraft in response to changes in the
security landscape. Mandiant has observed these actors trending away from purely
opportunistic campaigns, which seek to maximize the volume of attacks, toward
campaigns which require greater complexity. Attacker behavior patterns have
begun to emerge which demonstrate adoption of tools, tactics and procedures
(TTPs) which are more consistent with more advanced threat groups. As defense
technology advances so do multifaceted extortion operators. The impetus to
maintain operations and increase monetary gains has forced these operators to
adopt new techniques and even more dramatic extortion demands. While attacker
objectives remain consistent, their methods have evolved, leading to greater
monetary gains for threat actors and a growing population of threat groups
seeking to replicate these successes.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

39

Beginning in November 2019 and increasing throughout 2020, Mandiant observed
threat actors combining ransomware operations with data theft extortion. During
these types of operations, malicious actors steal sensitive data before deploying
ransomware on the network and then threaten to release the stolen data if the
ransom is not paid. Actors use the release of sensitive data during negotiations
to drive up the price of extortion and secure more timely payments from a victim
organization. The exposure of data which triggers a notification requirement is
often a major concern during an organization’s incident response process. While
some stolen sets of data would not trigger regulatory reaction, these actors would
often prey upon the potential brand damage which could occur as a result in a loss
of confidence and trust from partners and customers.
Historically, post-compromise ransomware actors have used data theft to obtain
information that can expand their presence in a target network. However, they
are now seeking additional types of data to support their extortion operations.
As ransomware operators evolve into multifaceted extortion operators they seek
access to sensitive information which can provide enhanced leverage during
negotiations, and the opportunities to detect them increase dramatically. Mandiant
has observed these operators steal a diverse set of data from target environments,
including termination agreements, contracts, medical records and encryption
certificates. Depending on the organization’s degree of network segmentation,
access to the enclaves which would house these data types would require the use
of multiple credentials across disparate systems. Each system introduces further
opportunities for the attacker to be detected and evicted from the network prior
to any theft of sensitive data or activation of encryption tools.
Multifaceted extortion operators have used a wide range of tactics to increase
pressure on data theft victims. Operators of the MAZE ransomware threatened
to use stolen data to conduct targeted spam campaigns while the operators of
the Ragnar Locker ransomware used Facebook ads to shame victims. The most
common tactic was the creation and maintenance of name-and-shame sites
where these operators would post data stolen from victims who refused to pay
the extortion. Analysis of the content available on various shaming websites
from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020, highlights several trends among
victims; the data is obviously skewed toward those who chose not to acquiesce to
extortion demands. There is a distinct upward trend in both the number of victims
that have appeared on these sites (Fig. 1) and the number of groups using this
methodology to pressure victims.
This method of combining ransomware and data theft has proven successful for
several multifaceted extortion operations. Consequently, other threat actors have
attempted to follow suit. MAZE operators started the shaming website trend
in December 2019 and in February 2020, SODINOKIBI and DOPPELPAYEMER
followed suit with their own versions of shaming websites. By March 2020, NEMTY,
NEFILIM, CLOP, Sekhmet and m1x operators also started using shaming websites.
Since then, there has been an average of at least one new shaming website each
month through September 2020. Based on these shaming websites, media outlets
and Mandiant incident response engagements, Mandiant Threat Intelligence has
identified more than 800 alleged multifaceted extortion victims who likely had
data stolen. This number has continued to grow steadily as more operators have
started websites to support extortion demands and data publishing.

Most of the victim organizations listed on shaming websites have been based in
the U.S. and spanned nearly every industry vertical, demonstrating the widespread
targeting basis of these operations. Based on available data, organizations within
the manufacturing sector have been impacted more than other industries. There
are likely several contributing factors including the perception these organizations
may be more likely to pay to prevent monetary losses due to production
downtime and their overall cyber security posture relative to other sectors. Several
ransomware families have also been deployed alongside scripts with process kill
lists for industrial processes. Other industries experiencing frequent multifaceted
extortion attacks included professional services, retail, technology, financial
services, healthcare and construction and materials.
Over the last few years, traditional malware based ransomware has evolved
into multifaceted extortion through repeated and deliberate operations costing
organizations and governments millions of dollars. In response, many organizations
took steps to limit the potential impact of broad-scale encryption by ensuring their
disaster recovery plans included a similar scenario. However attacker-encrypted
files is just one of many impacts victims face in a multifacted extortion incident.
New technologies and better visibility into the methodologies used by attack
groups have increased opportunities for early detection. As defensive security
evolves and organizations continue to invest in a broader security position,
attackers are guaranteed to modify their operations to keep pace with those
changes. Until multifaceted extortion operations can be reliably interrupted
through legal and policy changes, the burden of their effects will continue to fall on
organizations and the security teams which support them.

Steps Toward Proactive
Hardening Against Ransomware
in Multiple Environments
Given the surge of ransomware events observed throughout
2020 and into 2021, organizations must proactively ensure
environments are hardened to mitigate the potential impact
of ransomware deployment. After reviewing ransomware engagements
supported throughout 2020, Mandiant experts uncovered several actions
organizations should prioritize to mitigate the risk of ransomware incidents. These
actions would address several common issues observed, including:
• Large numbers of highly privileged accounts in Active Directory
• Highly privileged non-computer accounts configured with service principal
names (SPNs)
• Security controls not configured to minimize the exposure and usage of
privileged accounts across endpoints
• Attackers modifying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for ransomware deployment

Large Numbers of Highly Privileged Accounts in Active Directory
When conducting initial reconnaissance within target environments, Mandiant
experts observed ransomware attackers “living off the land”: using native builtin tools (such as cmd.exe, PowerShell, WMI) to query information from Active
Directory. Attackers also often used open-source tools, such as AdFind and
BloodHound, to identify privileged accounts and accounts that presented a path
to Domain Admin.
Privileged accounts within Active Directory represent more than just accounts
assigned membership in the built-in domain-based privileged groups (Domain
Admins, Enterprise Admins, Schema Admins, Administrators and Server
Operators). Apart from the domain-based privileged groups, many organizations
have delegated permissions to additional groups and accounts throughout
Active Directory, which significantly increases the number of resources deemed

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

42

to be highly privileged. If an attacker is able to capture valid credentials or even
impersonate access from an account assigned privileged access, this can escalate
the attacker’s ability to move laterally, access data and deploy ransomware to
many endpoints.
Organizations should proactively review Active Directory for accounts resident in
the default domain-based privileged groups as well as accounts which:
• Have been delegated permissions at the root of the domain–including
permissions for DS-Replication-Get-Changes and DS-Replication-Get-ChangesAll (which can be used to initiate a DCSync attack)
• Have been explicitly assigned elevated permissions on domain controllers
• Have been delegated explicit permissions for organizational units (OUs) that
contain many computer and user objects
• Have local administrative permissions on many endpoints
• Are configured for unconstrained or constrained Kerberos delegation
• Are not configured to protect against delegation (not members of the Protected
Users Security Group – or do not have the “Sensitive and Cannot Be Delegated”
attribute configured)
• Are protected by AdminSDHolder
• Have the ability to edit, link or unlink Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
• Have the ability to change passwords for many accounts (User-Force-ChangePassword permissions)
• Have user rights assignment permissions configured in Group Policy that permit
remote logon capabilities to a large scope of endpoints

Highly Privileged Non-Computer Accounts Configured with Service
Principal Names (SPNs)
Service principal names (SPNs) are legitimately used by Active Directory to
identify unique service instances with service logon accounts for Kerberos
authentication. Non-computer accounts configured with an SPN represent
accounts that ransomware attackers will initially target for Kerberoasting.1 If an
account’s password can be brute-forced using the Kerberoasting technique, an
attacker can potentially use the account for lateral movement, privilege escalation
and ransomware staging and deployment. Unfortunately, many organizations have
highly privileged accounts configured with an SPN, which makes this attack-path
highly successful.
Organizations can proactively review the scope of accounts configured with an
SPN using PowerShell. (Fig 2.)

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

43

Non-computer accounts configured with an SPN are expected to exist within
Active Directory since some service accounts will likely have this configuration.
Organizations should prioritize permissions assigned to these accounts and ensure
enforcement of security controls to minimize privileges and lateral movement
capabilities.

Security Controls Not Configured to Minimize the Exposure and Usage
of Privileged Accounts Across Endpoints
When endpoint security controls were not configured to minimize the exposure of
privileged accounts, ransomware attackers were able to capture valid credentials
from memory to expand the scope of their access. The recent Mandiant white
paper, Ransomware Protection and Containment Strategies3, recommends several
proactive hardening measures to protect privileged accounts:
• Use the Protected Users security group to house non-service privileged
accounts.
• Disable methods that store clear-text credentials in memory on endpoints (such
as WDigest and Windows Credential Manager). This also includes using a Group
Policy configuration to automatically reapply these settings if they were to be
modified on the local endpoint by an attacker.
• Enforce Credential Guard and Remote Credential Guard on Windows 10 and
Windows Server 2016+ endpoints. For older endpoints, Restricted Admin Mode
should be used when remote desktop connections are initiated using privileged
accounts.
• Use Microsoft LAPSx4 or other third-party tools to randomize the password for
the built-in local administrator account on endpoints.
• Implement a tiered model to guide enforcement of guardrails that define where
and how privileged accounts can be used. Guardrail enforcement can be defined
within Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or when using authentication silos.
• Ensure privileged actions are only initiated from dedicated privileged access
workstations (PAWs) or jump boxes.
• Protect privileged accounts against delegation (such as “Sensitive and Cannot
Be Delegated” enforcement).
• Enforce the Windows Firewall to restrict protocols which could be used for
lateral movement, remote access and ransomware deployment across endpoints.
• Restrict the scope of accounts and groups where permissions are configured
to allow lateral movement across endpoints. Specifically, privileged accounts
should be denied the ability to logon to Tier 1 and Tier 2 endpoints (with local or
Group Policy settings):
– Deny access to this computer from the network (SeDenyNetworkLogonRight)
– Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services
(SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight)
– Deny log on locally (SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight)
– Deny log on as a service (SeDenyServiceLogonRight)

• Restrict the scope of accounts and groups where permissions could be used for
privilege escalation and data access, including assigned user rights that provide
capabilities to:
– Debug programs (SeDebugPrivilege)
– Back up files and directories (SeBackupPrivilege)
– Restore files and directories (SeRestorePrivilege)
– Take ownership of files or other objects (SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege)

Attackers Modifying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for Ransomware
Deployment
Group policy was a common method used by attackers to deploy ransomware
to many endpoints. After compromising an account with GPO edit permissions,
attackers commonly targeted GPOs which were linked at the root of the domain
(such as Default Domain Policy), and then added scheduled tasks, logon scripts or
software installation packages to mass deploy and execute encryptors.
Organizations should proactively review Active Directory to enumerate accounts
with the ability to edit existing GPOs. Additionally, organizations should identify
which accounts can link and unlink GPOs within the domain.
A recently-published Mandiant white paper5 details specific command references
for reviewing GPO permissions as well as strategies for monitoring event logs to
detect GPO creations and modifications.

Recovery and Reconstitution
Challenges in Post-Ransomware
Scenarios

Following a ransomware attack, sustained business operations
are predicated on an organization’s ability to restore and
reconstitute systems, data and access in a secure manner.
Ideally, recovery and reconstitution should run parallel to the investigation into
how an attacker was able to gain access, move laterally, steal data (if applicable)
and deploy ransomware. If recovery and reconstitution steps are not performed
securely, an attacker will likely maintain their access, resulting in continued risk,
extended downtime and future attacks.

Investigative Steps to Empower recovery and Reconstitution
Mandiant experts noted that organizations that led successful recovery and
reconstitution efforts were empowered by facts and evidence identified from
investigating the ransomware incident prior to taking action. To ensure a secure
recovery and reconstitution plan when responding to ransomware incidents,
Mandiant experts prioritize answering the following questions:
• What persistence mechanisms (backdoors) are being used by an attacker to
maintain access within the environment?
• What command-and-control (CnC) channels are being used by an attacker for
access that need to be blocked either at ingress and egress points, or using
host-based endpoint firewalls?
• How was the ransomware deployed (manual propagation using a tool such as
PsExec, group policy modification, scheduled tasks or logon script)?
• Can the ransomware propagation vector be stopped and contained?
• Which compromised accounts can be used for lateral movement and
ransomware deployment?

45

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

46

• Which endpoints still exhibit a running encryptor?
• What was the primary vector used for initial access?
• Which accounts have privileged access within the environment?
As specific facts are uncovered and correlated, proper isolation and hardening
steps must be aligned to recovery and reconstitution workstreams. Until specific
investigative information about the ransomware event is understood (primary
persistence methods and backdoors, CnC channels, ransomware propagation
mechanisms and scope of compromised accounts), an organization may be forced
to temporarily disconnect access from the Internet to begin triaging, reviewing and
securely planning for hardening and recovery.

Use of Secure Enclaves
Organizations that were able to successfully recover and reestablish operations
used processes that included the use of secure enclaves (such as VLANs) to safely
restore and reconstitute systems. Initially, systems housed within the enclaves were
restricted from communicating with most impacted systems and were designated
as a clean (green) source of trust and security within the environment.
Systems within the enclaves were only permitted to communicate with trusted
endpoints and security (EDR) tools and with investigative tools used to ensure
the endpoints were not exhibiting signs of active encryptors or other malicious
activity.
Restored or newly-built domain controllers were usually the first endpoints
established within the secure enclaves and connectivity to additional endpoints
was expanded once the initial ransomware outbreak had been successfully
contained.

Common Contributors to a Degraded Recovery and
Reconstitution Workstream
Active Directory Lock-Out
Throughout 2020, Mandiant observed attackers not only deploying ransomware
within victim environments but also locking out administrators from Active
Directory. Even if domain controllers were operational, after an attacker
obtained domain administrative privileges, they changed the passwords for valid
administrator accounts. As a result, organizations were unable to regain access and
subsequent control within Active Directory to begin recovery and reconstitution
actions. To regain access to Active Directory, organizations often had to boot a
domain controller from physical media and replace the Utility Manager binary
(utilman.exe) with cmd.exe. Consequently, when the user clicked on Utility
Manager (on the login screen) they actually launched a command prompt from
which a new password could be set for a known account.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

47

Domain Controller Restoration Challenges
When ransomware is deployed within an environment, domain authentication and
the ability to connect to domain-based resources are generally impacted. To begin
recovery and reconstitution efforts, most organizations will prioritize restoring
domain controllers to an operational state. Unfortunately, when domain controller
backups are unavailable or have been corrupted, organizations may be faced with
rebuilding their domain infrastructure.
The corruption of SYSVOL is often one of the main factors resulting in domain
authentication and domain services being unavailable. SYSVOL refers to a set of
folders and files that are present and replicated amongst each domain controller.
When the contents of SYSVOL (which include group policy templates and settings
as well as scripts) are either encrypted or corrupted and replication occurs,
the contents cascade to all domain controllers and impact domain operations.
Without timely backups, rebuilding and reconstituting SYSVOL can be a complex
process. To avoid having to rebuild SYSVOL entirely, organizations should ensure
backup processes include system state backups of domain controllers. If system
state backups are not possible, organizations should at least back up the SYSVOL
directory and data tree (%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSVOL) as well as the Active
Directory database (%SYSTEMROOT%\ntds\ntds.dit). Ideally, domain controller
backups should be stored and secured either offline or on storage clusters that
are logically segmented and restricted from being directly accessed using
domain accounts.
When restoring Active Directory from domain controller backups was the only
viable option to reconstitute domain services, organizations first needed to
ensure they had a working and tested backup plan and strategy to guarantee the
availability and integrity of the schema and domain services which needed to be
reconstituted. The following domain controller recovery and reconstitution best
practices should be proactively reviewed by the organization:
• Offline backups—offline domain controller backups should be secured and
stored separately from online backups.
• Encryption—backup data should be encrypted both during transit (over the
wire) and when at rest or mirrored for offsite storage.
• DSRM Password validation—the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)
password should be set to a known value for each domain controller. This
password is required when performing an authoritative or non-authoritative
domain controller restoration.
• Alert configuration for backup operations—backup products and technologies
should be configured to detect and provide alerting for operations critical to
the availability and integrity of backup data (such as deletion of backup data,
purging of backup metadata, restoration events and media errors).
• Role-based access control—Access to backup media and the applications that
govern and manage data backups should use role-based access controls to
restrict accounts with access to stored data and configuration parameters.
• Testing and verification—both authoritative and non-authoritative domain
controller restoration processes should be documented and tested.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

48

Insufficient Backup and Restoration Processes
Organizations that lacked effective backup and restoration processes struggled
to reestablish business operations in a timely manner. This resulted in extended
downtime, financial impacts, regulatory challenges and an overall impact to brand
reputation. Many organizations were either unable to restore and reconstitute data
to meet business operations requirements or had to fully rebuild core systems and
applications, which further impacted business continuity.
Organizations that had effective backup and restoration processes were able to
mobilize quickly and invoke secure restoration activities which ran in parallel to
the overall investigation and environment hardening workstreams. Examples of
effective backup and restoration processes include:
• Clear delineation of responsibility for managing and verifying data and
application backups.
• Alignment of backup and restoration processes with business continuity and
disaster recovery plans.
• Online and offline data backup retention policies, including initiation, frequency,
verification and testing (for both on-premises and cloud-based data).
• Backup infrastructure that was segmented within the environment and only
accessible using dedicated accounts for interfacing with and managing backup
platforms and storage.
• A well-defined understanding of crown jewels data and supporting applications
which align to backup, failover and restoration tasks that prioritize missioncritical business operations.
• Role-based access control that restricts the scope of accounts with access to
backup media and the applications that govern and manage data backups, as
well as stored data and configuration parameters.
• Training and validation exercises for failover and restoration tasks that focuses
not only on data, but also crown jewel applications and services.
• Established service level agreements (SLAs) with vendors to prioritize
application and infrastructure-focused support.

Summary
Ransomware resiliency defenses encompass a combination of technical and
process-oriented controls. When organizations are unprepared, the impact can
be time-consuming and costly. Throughout 2020, Mandiant worked with many
organizations to proactively review, test, and enhance defenses to combat
ransomware. While challenges remain, applying best practices can go a long way
towards realizing robust recovery and reconstitution efforts.

How a Threat Activity Cluster Becomes an “APT” or “FIN” Group
Mandiant analysts review threat activity data from a variety of sources—such as
FireEye security product telemetry and Mandiant incident response engagements
and research—to identify noteworthy clusters. Our team of technical and threat
researchers, analysts and reverse engineers begin their work from known indicators
and attempt to find related indicators, activity or other data. When only a small
cluster of activity is found, we reference that activity in finished intelligence
(FINTEL) without a formal name to various channels, which may include Mandiant
Advantage and external blogs. Example: “Suspected Iran-based nation-state threat
actors sent spear phishing emails….”
Uncategorized (UNC) groups are raw attribution analysis that were previously kept
primarily in house. An UNC is a cluster of cyber intrusion activity—which includes
observable artifacts such as adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft. UNCs
are created based on a defining, anchoring characteristic often discovered during
a single incident. As we discover new artifacts associated with other incidents and
proactive collection efforts, the UNC provides a framework to join discrete pieces of
evidence together.
Some clusters develop further with sufficient or consistent research that identifies
their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In these cases, the cluster is given a
temporary “TEMP.<xxx>” group name. For example, APT37 was previously reported
as the “TEMP.Reaper” group.
As our knowledge of a TEMP group becomes sufficiently mature, we apply a
consistent, rigorous methodology to assign the actor a formal APT or FIN number.
Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are generally focused on espionage
activities. Financially-motivated (FIN) groups are highly organized criminal groups
engaging in crime for financial gain, such as payment card data theft, business email
fraud and extortion activities.

FIN11: A Widespread Ransomware and Extortion Operation
FIN11 is a financially motivated group that has been active since at least 2016. The
group uses malware such as FlawedAmmyy and FRIENDSPEAK in widespread
phishing campaigns that have impacted organizations across a broad range of
sectors and geographic regions. To monetize its operations, FIN11 deploys CLOP
ransomware and extorts victims for the non-release of stolen data shared via its
public leak site. In at least one case, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed FIN11
use point-of-sale (POS) malware. Although the group does not exhibit a high level
of technical sophistication, FIN11 appears to consistent evolve its malware delivery
tactics and techniques. The group has also relied on several support services to
accomplish its mission (Fig. 3).
FIN11 includes a subset of activity that some security researchers call TA505. This
term has been widely used in the security community to discuss large-scale spam
campaigns that date to 2014 and initially distributed malware families such as
the Dridex Trojan and Locky ransomware. We have not attributed TA505’s early
operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names interchangeably.

We have no evidence that indicates when FIN11 was formed. We began tracking
FIN11 (as UNC902) in 2017 (Fig. 4). It is plausible that the historical TA505 activity,
which dates to at least 2014, was FIN11 (or a FIN11 member); however, we can’t
independently verify those claims, and the purported use of services (such as
Dridex and Emotet) complicates attribution analysis. Given the lack of first-hand
knowledge and the mutable nature of criminal groups, any beliefs about when the
group was formed would be speculative.
FIN11 was chosen for graduation due to the group’s high activity level, its
successful compromise of multiple organizations, our insight into the group’s TTPs
across the attack life cycle and our clients’ interest in FIN11 and ransomware. There
were several developments in Fall 2019 that supported this decision. From 2017
through mid-2019, we had limited insight into the later stages of FIN11 intrusions.
In early Fall 2019, Mandiant responded to multiple FIN11 CLOP deployments that
helped fill in those knowledge gaps. Further, in September 2019 the group replaced
the FlawedAmmyy backdoor with FRIENDSPEAK and MIXLABEL, which created
additional client interest.
FIN11 campaigns have impacted a wide variety of sectors and geographical
regions. The group’s spam campaigns from 2017 to 2018 primarily targeted
organizations in the financial, retail and restaurant sectors. In 2019 and 2020, FIN11
expanded its targeting to a larger, more indiscriminate and diverse set of industries
and countries, often using generic financial lures. However, a portion of FIN11’s 2019
and 2020 campaigns targeted organizations in specific industries or regions; to
appear more legitimate, the group often used the target’s native language coupled
with manipulated email sender information, such as spoofed email display names
and email sender addresses. The shift in targeting observed during the past two
years may be the result of FIN11’s transition from point-of-sale (POS) malware to
ransomware as their main monetization method.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

53

A hallmark of FIN11 activity since at least January 2019 has been its rapid
evolution of phishing campaign TTPs. Throughout its 2019 and 2020 phishing
campaigns, the group has made small changes to its initial delivery mechanisms,
likely in attempts to circumvent victims’ detection regimes. For example, in
September 2019, the actors attached macro-laden Office files directly to phishing
emails, but over the next few months the infection chain became incrementally
more convoluted. By March 2020, most FIN11 phishing campaigns used HTML
attachments to load a redirect from a compromised URL to a download domain
that subsequently delivered a macro-laden Office file. We assess that these
relatively minor and less novel modifications are not reflective of the group’s
sophistication.

While FIN11 doesn’t exhibit a particularly high level of technical sophistication, the
group’s methods are relatively efficient and effective (Fig. 5). The group rarely
uses exploits as their initial infection vector and instead relies on phishing emails
and user execution (opening macro-laden Microsoft Office files) to obtain an
initial foothold. The actors then use common exploitation frameworks and publicly
available utilities for reconnaissance, privilege escalation and lateral movement.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

We suspect that several malware families are exclusive to FIN11, but it isn’t clear
if FIN11 develops its tools or outsources development. It is plausible that FIN11
uses gaps in phishing activities for tool development, as we have often observed
new versions of the MIXLABEL backdoor being deployed shortly after the group
resumes operations. Some researchers have stated that CLOP is a Cryptomix
variant, which could suggest that the tool was acquired. However, while Mandiant
did identify some notable overlaps between the two ransomware families, we have
insufficient evidence to support the theory that CLOP is a variant of Cryptomix.
We have no reason to believe that other actors will begin using the malware
families that appear exclusive to the group. FIN11 seems to be the exclusive user of
FlawedAmmyy; we have not observed FlawedAmmyy activity since FIN11 ceased
using the backdoor in 2019. Similarly, the group has been using BARBWIRE and
MIXLABEL since 2018, and we have no evidence to suggest that other groups use
these tools.
FIN11 has used several similar droppers—MINEDOOR, SPOONBEARD and
FORKBEARD—to deliver malware such as FRIENDSPEAK and BARBWIRE. We
suspect that these droppers are not exclusive to the group, as they have also been
used to pack malware typically associated with other threat groups.
Despite the group’s widespread high-volume phishing campaigns, we have only
observed evidence of FIN11 successfully monetizing its operations in a handful of
cases. In late 2018, Mandiant observed FIN11 attempt to monetize its operations
using the point-of-sale (POS) memory scraping tool BLUESTEAL at a restaurant
organization. Since then, FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware at a variety of
organizations and incorporated data theft to increase the pressure on victims to
pay extortion fees.
In 2020, FIN11 has conducted hybrid extortion attacks, combining ransomware
with data theft to pressure its victims to submit to extortion demands. In cases
where we observed data theft, the actors accessed several dozen systems, staged
data in RAR archives, uploaded the files to MegaSync servers, deployed CLOP
ransomware and then sent an email threatening to publish the data. The exfiltrated
data was later posted to a dark website named CL0P^_- LEAKS. Given that we
have only observed CLOP distributed by FIN11, we judge that the group also
maintains this site.
We assess with moderate confidence that FIN11 is likely operating out of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) based on Russian-language file
metadata, avoidance of CLOP deployments in CIS countries and the observance of
the Russian New Year and Orthodox Christmas holiday period.
FIN11’s frequent, high-volume phishing campaigns are likely an attempt to cast
a wide net rather than a reflection of the group’s capabilities to monetize an
expansive number of victims simultaneously. Even if the campaigns have a
relatively low success rate, it is unlikely that FIN11 has the resources to monetize
each intrusion prior to being detected. FIN11 may selectively choose victims to
exploit further based on criteria such as their geolocation, sector or perceived
security posture. Mandiant expects FIN11 spam campaigns to continue in
the immediate future and, barring law enforcement action, with continued
diversification in delivery tactics.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused systemic disruptions to
nearly every institution and community, which introduced significant
pressure on global leaders to find solutions to prevent or minimize
the spread of the illness and economic fallout. In this climate, a successful
coronavirus vaccine, as well as proven strategies for containing spread and treating
symptoms, are highly prized. Mandiant experts have observed that governments
deployed cyber espionage capabilities in pursuit of any information that may
support their own domestic recovery and vaccine development efforts and provide
a strategic advantage internationally.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

Throughout 2020, Mandiant Threat Intelligence tracked many cyber espionage
campaigns likely seeking COVID-19 vaccine or treatment data , including
Vietnamese, Chinese, North Korean, Iranian and Russian threat groups. Many of
these threat groups have been active for years and have been successful in the past.
State-sponsored activity potentially targeting COVID-19 research and response
began in January when Mandiant tracked broad China-nexus APT41 activity
affecting pharmaceutical companies through router and VPN vulnerability
information (Fig. 6). Around the same time frame, Vietnam’s APT32 conducted
a campaign targeting Chinese public and private entities, likely in efforts to gain
insight into the management and monitoring of the COVID-19 outbreak.
In March, the World Health Organization reported on Korea-linked actors targeting
its officials, and in May, the U.S. released an advisory on ongoing China-linked
campaigns targeting COVID-19 research. In April, Iran’s UNC788 targeted US
pharmaceutical organizations; in addition, we observed the actor tracked as
UNC2062 target medical research facilities in the spring of 2020. In May through
July, the U.S. government released multiple statements and advisories, some of
which were released jointly with foreign partners, related to state-sponsored
campaigns targeting COVID-19 data. In the fall, public reporting indicated that
Russia’s APT28 targeted coronavirus treatment and vaccine research. During this
time and into 2021, we also observed North Korean-related activity move to target
US pharmaceuticals.

APT32
APT32 is a Vietnam-nexus cyber espionage actor that conducts foreign and
domestic surveillance using commercial tools against internal targets. FireEye
has tracked APT32 since 2012, and observed targeting of foreign governments,
journalists, dissidents, and foreign corporations that may have a vested interest in
Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors.
From at least January to April 2020, APT32 carried out intrusion campaigns
that Mandiant believes were designed to collect intelligence on COVID-19. The
campaigns targeted select victims in Beijing and Wuhan, where COVID-19 was first
identified. The spear phishing emails sent to these targets contained malicious
attachments and embedded tracking links; a subset of the emails included
COVID-19 themes. Targeted organizations included China’s Ministry of Emergency
Management and the Wuhan government.
APT32 likely used coronavirus-themed malicious attachments against additional
Chinese-speaking targets. While we have not uncovered the full attack chain, we
identified a METALJACK loader displaying a COVID-19 decoy document with a
Chinese language title while launching its payload.

APT41
APT41 is a Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially
motivated activity potentially outside of state control. Its activity traces back to
2012 when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated
operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely statesponsored activity.
Between January and March 2020, Mandiant observed APT41 attempt to
exploit vulnerabilities in remote access and network appliances at more than 75
customers. APT41 targeted Citrix NetScaler/ADC, which includes VPN functionality
(CVE-2019-19781), Cisco routers and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central
(CVE-2020-10189) in attempts to gain access to organizations in the healthcare,
government, education, aerospace and defense, transportation, public and nonprofit sectors.

UNC788
UNC788 is a cluster of threat activity suspected of conducting cyber espionage
operations on behalf of the Iranian government. Also reported on by ClearSky
and CERTFA as “Charming Kitten” and by Microsoft as “Phosphorus,” UNC788 is
characterized by credential theft operations against corporate and personal email
accounts.
In April 2020, UNC788 carried out a credential-harvesting campaign against multiple
targets, including the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The campaign was aimed at
gaining personal webmail credentials and likely targeted the victim with a spear
phishing email which included a link to a spoofed webmail login page. The group is
also believed to have targeted global health employees using similar tactics.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

UNC2062
In July 2020, a joint report from the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC),
Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE), and the U.S. Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) detailed the use of three malware families used to
compromise medical research companies in the U.K., U.S., and Canada. The report
attributed the observed activity to the Russian sponsored threat group APT29.
While plausible, we have not yet been able to corroborate this attribution. APT29
is believed to be affiliated with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) or the
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).
Mandiant tracks related activity as UNC2062 and observed the group using the
SIXPLUS backdoor (publicly referred to as WELLMESS) to target medical research
entities in the spring of 2020. We have also observed this threat group using
publicly available tools and targeting data related to COVID-19.

Threats Originating From North Korean Actors
Since October 2020, Mandiant Threat Intelligence has tracked multiple distinct
North Korean activity sets expand outside of established targeting patterns to
pharmaceuticals and medical research.
In November 2020, Mandiant reported to intelligence subscribers that a cyber
espionage campaign was distributing the CUTELOOP downloader through
employment-themed lure material. Since at least April 2020, this group had
marginally updated its toolset and expanded its targeting from aerospace and
defense to a U.S. pharmaceutical company. We believe this activity set to be North
Korean in origin and noted potential ties to another North Korean threat actor we
call TEMP.Hermit. A separate North Korean activity cluster we typically see seeking
intelligence on nuclear or international relations issues was also observed targeting
the same U.S. pharmaceutical company with the PENCILDOWN downloader.
We noted indications of this activity set also targeting organizations involved in
pharmaceutical research, including universities in Germany and South Korea, a
South Korean pharmaceutical company and a U.S. vaccine development company.
We also identified associated domains spoofing pharmaceutical, biotechnology,
research and other health institutions in September and October 2020, including
the World Health Organization (WHO).
The actors using PENCILDOWN almost certainly continued to register domains
spoofing pharmaceutical and healthcare companies in October 2020. They also
deployed the VENOMBITE loader against COVID-19 researchers in South Korea
from December 2020 to January 2021. These actors typically carry out strategic
intelligence collection surrounding ongoing Korean peninsula geopolitical issues
and most closely align with publicly reported “Kimsuky” operations. Mandiant
has detected multiple incidents of activity attributed to this activity cluster, and
this group is partially responsible for an increase in the volume of observed North
Korean espionage targeting multiple industry verticals in 2020. This actor set
possibly shares resources with both TEMP.Hermit and APT38; however, the lines of
demarcation between North Korea-linked groups remains disputed. Infrastructure
related to VENOMBITE also appears to indicate targeting of research universities
and pharmaceuticals as well. The pace of the group’s focus and targeted efforts on
medical and health entities underscore North Korea’s immediate needs related to
COVID-19 infections and treatments.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

61

Outlook and Implications
Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that COVID-19-related targeting of
the healthcare, pharmaceutical, medical research and closely related industries will
continue to be prominent for the foreseeable future while the pandemic continues.
Although targeting volume may not increase, the types of information targeted
and the depth of intrusions may be more impactful than many incidents before
the pandemic. Most of this COVID-19-related targeting will very likely continue
to be from espionage actors, with a much smaller portion likely from financially
motivated actors—particularly ransomware operators.
Additionally, contact tracing systems and applications deployed by governments,
and often developed and/or operated by third parties, will likely provide additional
targets of interest to both espionage and financially motivated actors, given the
value of large-scale databases for intelligence gathering, sale in underground
markets and development of phishing campaigns.

Mapping UNC2452 Activities
to the Targeted Attack Lifecycle
Framework

On December 13, 2020, FireEye published a report which
detailed a supply chain attack called SUNBURST—an implant in
the SolarWinds Orion platform being used to compromise target
environments. Mandiant tracks this activity as UNC2452 and suspects the
group is state-sponsored. While supply chain attacks are not unheard of in the
information security space, this attack used significantly complex, methodical and
deliberate tradecraft.
UNC2452 has demonstrated a facility with network intrusions which stand well
outside the standard set of activities attackers commonly employ during a breach.
Mandiant has observed UNC2452 take advantage of areas in an environment that
may be monitored less intensely than others, and remain within those areas as
long as possible to reduce opportunities for detection.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

Mandiant analysts use the Targeted Attack Lifecycle framework to model attacker
behaviors. Over thousands of engagements, the framework has provided a
common nomenclature to describe both individual incidents and attacker
methodologies. During an investigation, Mandiant consultants will often collect
forensic artifacts associated with specific stages of the Targeted Attack Lifecycle.
Mandiant consultants also use the framework to develop a structured narrative for
reporting investigative findings.

on one or more systems within an environment. UNC2452 targeted SolarWinds
and implanted SUNBURST into the build cycle of the SolarWinds Orion product.
UNC2452 managed to subvert the build process for SolarWinds Orion from March
2020 through June 2020; the trojanized binary maintained the normal trappings
of a legitimate software package. SolarWinds reported that 18,000 of their
approximately 33,000 Orion customers downloaded the trojanized dynamicallyloaded library (DLL) which constitutes SUNBURST. UNC2452 appeared to target
environments selectively based on the profiling data submitted to the Command
and Control (CnC) nodes.7 It is unclear whether UNC2452 would target victims
based on industry vertical or had specific organizations in mind, but the ability to
scope this phase of the lifecycle accurately is a critical step for security teams.

After initial installation, SUNBURST potentially sleeps for up to 14 days, attempts
to interrupt security instrumentation prior to launch and then starts beaconing via
DNS requests for avsvmcloud.com. These requests include encoded information
about the environment from which SUNBURST is beaconing. Any organization
that used SolarWinds Orion and updated to the trojanized version was practically
guaranteed to have at least attempted DNS requests (Stage 1).
Scoping the Initial Compromise phase from the perspective of the endpoint
focuses heavily on the SolarWinds Orion endpoints themselves. Security
teams should work to identify evidence that the malicious hotfix served by the
SolarWinds update process was downloaded and activated on their SolarWinds
Orion endpoints. Ideally, security teams would have imaged their SolarWinds Orion
systems and analyzed the image or investigated the endpoint using forensically
sound endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities. Fortunately, host
based indicators (HBIs) of SUNBURST are fairly straightforward.
During the update process the hotfix package is downloaded to the
%PROGRAMDATA%\SolarWinds\Installers\ directory along with a corresponding
SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp.log file in the %PROGRAMDATA%\
SolarWinds\Logs\Installer\<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_SS> directory. After
installation, the trojanized DLL associated with SUNBURST is written to the
%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Solarwinds\Orion\ directory.
The identification of the SUNBURST installer provides two valuable data points
for a follow-on investigation. First, confirming the existence of SUNBURST is
critical, but defining the earliest evidence of compromise can help drive the pace
of the investigation. While it was reported SUNBURST may sleep for 14 days
after installation, the check is performed against the NTFS Standard Information
Modified timestamp of the BusinessLayer DLL. In some cases, this timestamp
can persist from the time the archive was created, making this date less reliable.
Therefore, the NTFS Create timestamp for the BusinessLayer DLL is used as the
start of the timeline for a compromise in which UNC2452 used SUNBURST as the
initial vector.
Passive DNS logging makes Scoping Stage 1 SUNBURST requests a trivial exercise.
While it is possible to log requests on a local DNS server within the organization,
a more stable solution includes passive network collection of DNS requests. These
requests usually include the source and destination of the request, the time of
the request and relevant DNS-specific details such as the query, the answer and
various status indicators of both. In this configuration the sensor’s placement and
its effect on the quality of the data being captured are critical.
Depending on the placement of a passive sensor, the data captured may lack
visibility, reducing the accuracy of its logs. If a sensor is placed north of a local
server that provides DNS and recursive lookups, DNS requests emanating from
the server may not indicate the true source of the domain lookup. This limitation
may be overcome in relatively small or localized SolarWinds deployments, but can
generate more questions in a large-scale deployment. It is more desirable if the
sensor sits between the individual endpoint and any DNS resolution service.

Mission the attacker seeks to strengthen their
position in the environment by installing a persistent backdoor on the justcompromised endpoint. SUNBURST acts as a fully featured backdoor with
administrative access to the endpoint and runs as SYSTEM on the SolarWinds Orion
endpoint. Consequently, UNC2452 can maintain access to an environment as long
as the SolarWinds Orion systems remain active.
During startup SUNBURST checks the ReportWatcherRetry value in the
SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config file. If it is set to any value other
than 3, SUNBURST will launch; a value of 3 in ReportWatcherRetry acts as a
SUNBURST kill switch, which may be automated or manual. Mandiant experts
analyzed SUNBURST and identified a hardcoded list of IP address blocks that
control the malware’s behavior. DNS records returning values within these blocks
would terminate the malware and subsequently update the ReportWatcherRetry
value to prevent further execution. However, Mandiant Consulting engagements
have identified instances during which UNC2452 set the ReportWatcherRetry
value to 3 after successful acquisition of a secondary means of access to the
environment. When security teams identify an inactive ReportWatcherRetry value
they may need to determine why and how it was set.
<add key=”ReportWatcherRetry” value=”3” />

Figure 8.
Sample setting for
ReportWatcherRetry.

To further interact with the environment, UNC2452 can switch the DNS resolution
requests for avsvmcloud.com to a CNAME record response containing a domain
to which SUNBURST will subsequently communicate (Stage 2). While the full
breadth of the UNC2452 campaign remains opaque, it is safe to assume that even
an organization with state sponsorship would not be able to manage the workload
of 18,000 compromised networks. As of March 2021, the number of environments
that entered Stage 2 is suspected to be in the hundreds instead of the thousands.
Security teams can focus on the search for CNAME record responses. Depending
on how DNS traffic is monitored, available data may differ, but the best monitoring
provides the query, response and response type. If security teams identify CNAME
responses associated with SUNBURST Stage 2, their investigation is likely to
advance dramatically.
Ideally, Stage 2 CNAME DNS requests would be captured by passive DNS
logging within the environment. Secondary sources such as firewall logs can
identify potential Stage 2 activity in the environment but they rely on publicly
available threat intelligence. While searching firewall logs for the IP addresses of
known Stage 2 domains may help identify Stage 2 activity in an environment, it
is unlikely that every Stage 2 domain will be publicly disclosed. In fact, Mandiant
has identified the use of multiple domains during Stage 2 SUNBURST activity
in individual environments. Therefore, security teams should hunt for other
indications of attacker activity in their environment consistent with UNC2452
across the Targeted Attack Lifecycle.
In a few engagements, Mandiant has observed UNC2452 use the memory-only
dropper TEARDROP, which launches Cobalt Strike BEACON. If Cobalt Strike
BEACON was used by UNC2452, the CnC infrastructure was separate from the
infrastructure used by SUNBURST. UNC2452 has demonstrated significant caution

sh Foothold

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

regarding actions which would have exposed SUNBURST; this pattern persisted
in the instances where TEARDROP was deployed. While Cobalt Strike has a
reputation for stealth, UNC2452 appeared to take pains to ensure that
if Cobalt Strike was detected, the SUNBURST backdoor would not be burned in
the process.

UNC2452 clearly understands both security operations and incident response.
An incident’s initial attack vector often remains a mystery. UNC2452 was likely
counting on this knowledge gap to protect SUNBURST as long as possible. If the
Cobalt Strike implant were detected and an incident response process initiated
around the event, UNC2452 may have hoped that by avoiding a direct line
between SUNBURST and BEACON they could protect the former, a more costly
and advantageous tool.

Escalate Privileges
Complete Mission

In the Escalate Privileges phase, the attacker seeks to obtain further access to
systems and data in the target environment. This can include credential harvesting,
keystroke logging or the compromise of authentication systems. Success with
credential harvesting depends on the attacker’s skillset. UNC2452 is quite able
to surmount obstacles, research vulnerabilities and move towards their objective.
UNC2452 tries to progress to lateral movement from the SYSTEM privileges
provided by a SolarWinds Orion endpoint. In some cases, Mandiant has observed
a modified version of Mimikatz used to harvest password hashes from memory.
In other cases, Mandiant has observed UNC2452 use DCSync, a technique
that simulates the Windows domain controller (DC) replication process to an
unauthorized endpoint.
As an investigation moves through the cyclical portion of the Targeted Attack
Lifecycle, tracking malware-adverse adversaries relies on an in-depth and wellmaintained monitoring strategy. Groups such as UNC2452, which understand both
security operation center and incident response procedures, are likely to plan
their actions around activities which leave behind the least forensic evidence. For
example, the actions performed during a DCSync attack are legitimate actions
within an Active Directory (AD) environment. The ability to replicate AD objects
is a convenience that can add efficiency to an AD environment. When attempting
to identify a DCSync attack, security teams will often, by necessity, focus on
events that fall outside of common communications and actions between a DC
and another endpoint. Where enabled, the Windows Event ID 4662, which details
operations performed on directory service objects, can be used to identify DCSync
activity. It can be overwhelming to track all Event ID 4662 events. To better
manage the task, security teams should only enumerate those Event ID 4662
events that include values in their Operation > Properties field, such as Replicating
Directory Changes All or a combination of the globally unique identifiers (GUIDs)
listed in Figure 9.

Unfortunately, Event ID 4662 does not provide the source of any operation
request. Security teams will need to carefully scrutinize suspicious events identified
through Event ID 4662 analysis and identify any correlated events that point to the
source of the DCSync. Searching for instances of access from SolarWinds systems
to domain controllers may help reduce the dataset of potential connections.
However, UNC2452 has been observed to run DCSync from systems affected by
SUNBURST as well as other endpoints.

functions, and DSGetNCChanges, which requests AD object updates from the
domain controller, are both key indicators for identifying DCSync. Unfortunately,
not all customer environments conduct the degree of internal monitoring
necessary to map RDP/DCE to actions taken across the network. While egress
monitoring has become more common in the last decade, monitoring internal
traffic exacerbates issues that have slowed the adoption of comprehensive
network monitoring solutions. The UNC2452 attack highlights network monitoring
gaps which have historically been acceptable risk areas in an organization’s
monitoring stance.
Complete Mission

Internal Reconnaissance
In the internal reconnaissance phase, the attacker explores the organization’s
environment to better understand its infrastructure, how and where it stores
information of interest, and the roles of critical users. In engagements where
attackers are less worried about stealth, Mandiant has often observed threat
actors use reconnaissance utilities that generate large volumes of data and create
detection opportunities. For UNC2452, the converse has been observed across
multiple organizations. UNC2452 was often found to use common Microsoft
Windows-related tools. For example, one of the few “noisy” actions conducted by
UNC2452 was the enumeration of file system shares. UNC2452 would regularly
peruse filesystem contents on remote systems, an activity that generates a
considerable amount of noise because of how verbose the SMB protocol can be. In
fact, SMB monitoring is rarely implemented for the same reason.
In organizations which did have SMB monitoring, reconnaissance performed by
UNC2452 would stand out because regular and in-depth enumeration of network
shares sourced from a SolarWinds system are atypical events. While this allowed
Mandiant consultants to identify the types of files UNC2452 would target, it also
provided insight into the data sources the attacker would avoid on the way to their
objective. As of March 2021, Mandiant has not observed UNC2452 target access to
customer data, personally identifiable information or financial data.
UNC2452 targeted data stores that acted as central stores of knowledge. Mandiant
has observed UNC2452 targeting access to online documentation stores, code
repositories, and IT and Infosec file shares. Logging resources associated with such
data stores are valuable hunting grounds for identifying reconnaissance activities.
Searching for access from uncommon sources or sources known to have been
affected by SUNBURST can provide substantial indicators to advance hunting
efforts. For example, SMB sessions between SolarWinds endpoints affected by
SUNBURST and a file server or administrative share may highlight times when the
attacker was particularly active on an endpoint, allowing security teams to identify
user accounts accessing data during those times. Similarly, quantifying serial
access to documentation stores by individual IP addresses within a set period may
lead back to a system compromised by UNC2452.

In the Lateral Movement phase, the attacker uses the accounts and knowledge

environment. Tracking UNC2452’s lateral movement is quite challenging, given the
large amount of network traffic originating from the SolarWinds Orion platform.

Creating timelines by identifying windows of attacker activity in the environment
can help reduce the amount of data to be analyzed. Reviewing common Windows
logon event types in aggregated windows event logs for the identified timelines
can help pinpoint instances of lateral movement. Every time UNC2452 progresses
further into an environment, the process of generating timelines, identifying
suspicious activities and hunting must be repeated. Every indicator the security
team can identify, no matter how small requires the re-examination of existing
datasets through a constantly changing lens of attacker motivations. However,
teams can quickly identify patterns undertaken by UNC2452. Every identification
of lateral movement becomes an opportunity to further quantify UNC2452
behavior and build a comprehensive understanding of their operations and
objectives.

Maintain Presence
During the Maintain Presence phase, the attacker ensures continued access to
the environment. Mandiant observed UNC2452 move away from SUNBURST as a
persistence mechanism when possible. UNC2452 commonly maintained access to
an environment through legitimate VPN sessions. After VPN access was stabilized,
UNC2452 sometimes activated the kill switch on SUNBURST and relied solely on
VPN access.
Complete Mission

In some investigations where Mandiant observed UNC2452 shift to VPN, a distinct
pattern emerged. UNC2452 applied the same level of tradecraft to source VPN
sessions as they did to other phases of the attack lifecycle. The threat actor
not only maintained an individual IP address from which an account would
authenticate over the lifetime of the account’s use, it also ensured the GeoIP
location of the IP address showed an address local to the target environment. In
some cases, Mandiant observed the threat actor changing the hostname of the
Windows-based virtual machines they were using to that of a legitimate hostname
in the target environment. While the actions taken to mask the true origin of the
VPN sessions were not costly or difficult, the effect on investigations could be
dramatic. Traditionally, incident response engagements use Windows Event Logs
as a trusted primary source and efforts to subvert those logs often rely on bulk
deletion. While this common tactic limits the ability of security professionals to
quantify attacker activity during a specific timespan, it still allows the qualification
of attacker activity. Windows endpoints log the action of Event Log deletion to the
event log which can become an actionable indicator of compromise. In fact, most
incident response firms look for quick wins by enumerating these events early in
the investigation. UNC2452 attacked this limitation from the other direction.
Instead of deleting logs, UNC2452 activities reduced the confidence security
professionals could maintain in a critical incident response dataset. Instead of
a one-to-one mapping of hostname to system, analysts would instead have
to consider a one-to-many mapping of hostname to systems—with at least
one being the legitimate host. These actions did not alter the intrinsic value or

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

70

accuracy of the logs themselves; instead, they made it dramatically more difficult
to compensate for the different mappings as the number of scenarios producing
this effect increased. A counterfeit hostname for an attacker-controlled system
is quite rare. As investigations progress, new findings spawn follow-on actions to
pursue deeper analyses. When analysts are not aware that a hostname might be
falsified, they may initiate follow-on workstreams which assume the legitimate
host is compromised. As analysts review endpoints which have been erroneously
identified as compromised, more time is required to disambiguate attacker activity
and legitimate activity when in truth attacker activity never originated from
the legitimate system. These unnecessary workflows draw valuable resources
away from the investigation—a worthwhile effect in the eyes of an attacker.
While UNC2452 was able to place roadblocks in the path of investigations, the
roadblocks sometimes provided opportunities for detection.
UNC2452 relied on virtual private server (VPS) infrastructure to limit ingress IP
addresses to geolocations which matched the target organizations geographical
spread, which meant VPN logs could be used for broad scale analysis. The source
IP address from which a VPN connection is established can be cross-referenced
with public data, including the autonomous system number (ASN) to which the IP
address belongs. Mandiant analyzed correlations between IP addresses extracted
from VPN logs and corresponding ASNs. From this dramatically reduced dataset,
analysts could begin to rule out VPN sessions based on an ASN’s owner and
quickly target ASNs associated with VPS providers. While some advanced users
may connect to a corporate VPN through a VPS, it should be a relatively rare
practice. Security teams should ensure they review each VPN session sourced
from a VPS provider because Mandiant has observed UNC2452 use multiple VPS
providers in individual environments.
By using legitimate VPN credentials, UNC2452 allowed Mandiant to successfully
perform “Impossible Travel” analysis, which correlates each VPN logon session’s
originating IP Address to the geolocation of the IP. Individual accounts with
successive logons from locations which are too geographically disparate for a
person to travel through using conventional means dramatically reduces the
dataset of potentially suspicious VPN sessions. The UNC2452 campaign was
conducted during the global lockdown resulting from COVID-19 policies, which
meant organizations were likely heavily invested in remote work. This enabled
the curation of a more accurate baseline of normal user activity. While UNC2452
used legitimate credentials and logged on from localities which broadly matched
the organization’s, this technique was not infallible. Mandiant observed instances
where accounts for users who were on leave were used by UNC2452 as well as
cases where international users would log on from US-based locales.
While the impact of using hostnames taken from targeted environments as
VPS hostnames had an appreciable effect on the pace of investigations, the
identification of this technique led to novel analysis methodologies. Mandiant
analysts were able to use services that perform data collection and historical
analysis of changes across the Internet to identify potential systems of interest.
One field commonly captured by these services is the RDP SSL certificate which
can leak the configured hostname of an endpoint. By querying for endpoints which
presented leaked hostnames matching those of legitimate hosts within customer
environments, Mandiant consultants were able to identify suspicious VPN sessions
and then review VPN log data to generate timelines of attacker activity.

Complete Mission
In the Complete Mission phase, the attacker accomplishes the objectives of the
intrusion. In some intrusions this can be intellectual property theft or disruption
of business operations. Investigation during this phase of the Targeted Attack
Lifecycle depends entirely on the accuracy and consistency of the timelines the
analysts previously built based on available data. In environments where UNC2452
was able to acquire VPN access, they could freely access data through common
protocols such as HTTP(S), SMB and SSH. The cross-referencing of timeline data
such as the VPN IP address with access logs for data stores can help security
teams identify individual accesses which result in data loss.

Conclusion
The UNC2452 campaign was extremely challenging to uncover and address. The
attacker was sophisticated enough to implant SUNBURST in the widespread and
broadly respected SolarWinds Orion platform. While UNC2452’s knowledge of
operational security was higher than most incident responders are likely to witness
first-hand, it doesn’t change the mission: security professionals must work to guard
against similar attacks from copycat threat actors. Well-designed environment
monitoring practices and procedures, along with rigorous investigation
methodologies serve as consistent ways to shine a bright light on the actions of
advanced attackers.

Insider Threat Risks
to Flat Environments

In mid-2020, a technology provider engaged Mandiant to investigate
a suspected intrusion in their environment. The client notified Mandiant
that an unauthorized user had accessed their development/test and Amazon Web
Services (AWS) environments remotely. The client had also identified evidence to
indicate the unauthorized user deleted Relational Database Service (RDS) backups
within the AWS environment. For this investigation, the insider threat team was
engaged to:
• Identify the attacker: Collect and deliver evidence that could identify the
unauthorized user.
• Determine any loss of client data: Review all forensic evidence for data theft.

insider threat team
investigates client

a Follow the Data

from the National
Institute of
Standards and
Technology (NIST)
and the National
Insider Threat
Taskforce (NITTF).
Their focused
data collection
allows clients to

legal actions, as
coordinated with
their third-party
legal counsels.

The Mandiant insider threat team analyzed AWS CloudTrail logs and Linux
authentication logs and identified a timeline of events which detailed the logon
activities of the suspected insider threat actor (Fig. 10).
While the threat actor took steps to provide a level of anonymity to their actions,
Mandiant experts were able to correlate discrete artifacts across sessions to tie the
activity to a single user.
Fifteen days before the employee was laid off, the Linux server logged a remote
SSH session from the IP address x.x.x.121 which authenticated using an SSH key
associated with the ubuntu account—a default account in Ubuntu-based Amazon
Machine Images (AMI). At the time of analysis, the IP address x.x.x.121 was
associated with a residential Internet provider.
Three days before the employee was laid off, AWS CloudTrail logged the
employee authenticating to cloud infrastructure from the IP address x.x.x.113 using
their legitimate credentials. At the time of analysis, the IP address x.x.x.113 was
associated with an anonymized VPN provider. During this session, AWS CloudTrail
logged the creation of users and as well as an EC2 instance by the employee.
Twelve hours after the employee had been laid off, the Linux server logged an SSH
session from the same x.x.x.113 IP address used to access AWS cloud infrastructure;
it was authenticated using the private key for the ubuntu account. By correlating
individual artifacts across multiple logging sources Mandiant consultants were
able to develop an evidence-backed narrative which associated the recently
discharged employee with both the anonymous VPN IP and the private key used
for certificate-based authentication.
AWS CloudTrail logs and host-based forensic artifacts allowed Mandiant
consultants to detail the actions undertaken by the recently laid off employee after
the employee had authenticated to the development server as the ubuntu account.
Command line history and sudo logs extant on the Ubuntu-based EC2 instance
provided key artifacts to drive further investigation into the AWS CloudTrail logs.
Mandiant experts identified logs that indicated the installation of the awscli toolset
which facilitates the submission of API requests to the AWS API.

Thirteen hours after the employee had been laid off, the ubuntu account used the
awscli utility to provision new AWS IAM user a account in the client’s AWS tenant.
Three hours later, after failing to enumerate the EC2 instances to which the new
AWS IAM account would have access, the ubuntu account issued API calls
which deleted RDS backups, removed the accounts it had created and terminated
the session.

Outcome
The Mandiant insider threat team was able to build a timeline of unauthorized
activity, assure the customer there was no evidence of client data loss and
subsequently remediate the environment to prevent similar future insider and
external threats. At the end of the engagement, the client’s environment was more
secure.

Recommendations
Credential revocation
The client believed the insider was not aware of the upcoming layoffs. Mandiant
often recommends that clients discharging employees should coordinate access
removal with notification to protect both the organization and the employee. This
would hold true even if an employee voluntarily resigns or retires. All SSH keys,
PEM files, service passwords and application passwords to which the individual had
access should be rotated for all environments. Similarly, provisions within multifactor authentication (MFA) should be immediately unenrolled when an employee
or contractor leaves the organization.

Network Segmentation
Historically, Mandiant has found that most client networks enable at least a basic
level of network segmentation. However, there often is no separation between the
development and production networks. Access controls between development
and production networks can limit opportunities for an unauthorized user to move
laterally between zones. Mandiant recommends organizations thoroughly review
their network segmentation and limit unnecessary traffic between sensitive and
less-trusted environments. This will help prevent insider threats from moving
laterally or connecting from an internal network segment to a cloud environment.
Also, systems that do not need to be public-facing should be segmented from
public access and restricted as much as possible.

Logging
In this case, the client had enabled logging and event aggregation to a security
information and event management (SIEM) system. This ensured the authenticity
of the logs used during the investigation. Linux based operating systems log
activity in plain text which provides an opportunity for an attacker to manually
edit the log entries generated by their activity. By streaming logs to a secondary
source, the client not only followed best-practice logging guidance but maintained
critical information necessary for an in-depth investigation.

Least Privilege
This client had many administrative controls for most of its production systems.
However, the development network had users with extensive permissions that
extended to the creation of accounts in both the client network and the cloud
environment. Mandiant recommends organizations implement comprehensive
user access controls across all environments on their networks to ensure that user,
developer and administrator accounts have only the necessary level of permissions
to complete their tasks and maintain business continuity.

Red Team Makes the Most
of Social Engineering and
System Misconfigurations

A financial services firm engaged Mandiant to evaluate the
effectiveness of its information security team’s detection,
prevention and response capabilities.
The Mandiant red team’s objectives were to avoid detection while accomplishing
the following tasks:
Mandiant red
team consultants
perform targeted,
objective-based
assessments using
a combination of
publicly available
and internally
developed tools.
Once the red team
is able to access
an environment,
observing how
legitimate
employees interact
with workstations
and applications
allows the red
team to blend in by
adopting behaviors
common to the
environment.

• Access Executive Email
• Access Sensitive Production Network
During this engagement, the red team consultants emulated advanced nationstate attackers regularly seen on the frontlines of Mandiant incident response
engagements.

Initial Compromise
While performing open-source intelligence (OSINT) reconnaissance to identify,
catalogue and analyze the client’s Internet-facing infrastructure, the red team
discovered a job application portal through which interview candidates could
submit documents. According to Mandiant threat intelligence, social engineering
is one of the most common initial attack vectors used by advanced attackers.
For this engagement, the red team used the job application portal to deliver
malicious documents which might be opened by employees during regular
business operations. This allowed the red team to use a trusted resource without
having to bypass email-based security controls. To increase the chance the resume
would be opened, the red team crafted a suitable candidate for employment
based on common job openings published by the customer and submitted the job
application and malicious resume through the application portal.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

77

The resume contained a malicious macro and a request that attempted to
convince the user to enable macro content to allow the execution of the embedded
code on their endpoint. Historically, the red team has found that applying personal
touches to attempts at social engineering increases the chance of success. In this
case, the red team sent a follow-up email to the HR department to demonstrate
enthusiasm from the applicant and check on the status of the resume.

Establishing a Foothold and Maintaining Access
Shortly after sending the follow up email to HR, a recruiter working for the
customer opened the malicious resume and enabled content, which provided
a Cobalt Strike command and control connection. The successful pre-text and
macro execution enabled the red team to gain a foothold into the environment.
Once a foothold is established APT groups often prioritize creating a means
through which consistent access to the environment can be maintained. After
establishing a successful Cobalt Strike session Mandiant’s red team sought to do
the same. To maintain access, the red team installed a Startup Folder persistence
mechanism within the profile of the compromised user, which would launch the
backdoor each time the user logged on to the compromised system.

Escalating Privileges and Lateral Movement
The ability to quickly reconnoiter an environment while remaining undetected
is a capability which often separates opportunistic attackers from advanced
attackers. The Mandiant red team uses tradecraft common to APT groups to
profile the behaviors of legitimate users and reduce the chance of detection. The
red team performed host-based reconnaissance on the HR user’s workstation to
gain situational awareness regarding the user’s privileges and systems to which
the user had access. This helped the red team identify an unquoted service
path on the system which could be used to escalate privileges. An unquoted
service path allows attackers to intercept execution flow by placing a binary in
a directory higher than that of the intended executable. The red team exploited
this misconfiguration to gain elevated access to the system. Using the elevated
privileges, the red team used Mimikatz to access the local administrator password
hash on the system.
While the privileges acquired through the unquoted service path vulnerability
provided a greater level of access to the local host, it did not directly facilitate
moving deeper into the environment. The development and adoption of the
Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) has dramatically reduced
the attack surface associated with the reuse of Local Administrator passwords.
However, deployment of LAPS can be inconsistent across environments.
Looking through the client’s Active Directory environment, the Mandiant red
team enumerated systems that were not managed by LAPS by querying for the
absence of the “ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime” computer object attribute.
This produced a list of endpoints to which the red team could potentially
authenticate using the recently acquired local administrator password hash. The
red team tested the validity of the compromised Local Administrator account
and identified several servers on which the credentials were valid. One of those
servers was configured with the unconstrained delegation property which
can allow attackers with administrative access to impersonate any account
which has successfully authenticated to that system. To force the client’s
domain controller to authenticate to the just-compromised unconstrained
delegation server, the red team used the ‘printer bug’ attack which sends an

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

78

‘RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotification’ request to a domain controller
running the Print Spooler service. As a result of this request, the domain controller
tests the connection, which provides the Kerberos Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) for
the domain controller machine account.
The red team used the captured Kerberos TGT to impersonate the client’s domain
controller machine account and perform a DCSync attack. A successful DCSync
attack provides the NTLM password hashes for any account in the target domain,
including domain administrator users. The password hashes acquired through
DCSync allowed the red team to move through the client’s environment freely and
focus on their access objectives.

Accessing High-Value Objectives
During the initial scoping for the engagement, the client tasked the Mandiant red
team to gain access to the contents of an executive’s email account and move
laterally into a sensitive production network.

Executive Email Access
Due to newly adopted work from home practices paired with heavy adoption
of cloud services, the client’s employees were not centrally located as would
be expected with a traditional office model. Their Office 365 email access was
protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA), so the red team chose to target
executive workstations for email access. The NTLM hashes gathered during the
DCSync attack were processed and fed through an offline password-cracking
server internal to Mandiant, which returned plain text credentials for an executive
account. The red team then monitored the environment to see when executive
workstations were connected to the internal network either directly or through a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) concentrator. Once an executive’s workstation was
connected to the internal network, the red team tested the validity of credentials
by mapping the C$ share and gained interactive access to the endpoint—and the
user’s email—with the executive’s compromised credentials.

Accessing Sensitive Production Network
Access to the production network also presented substantial obstacles for the
red team. The customer required all connections between the corporate and
production networks to traverse a jumphost protected by MFA. To identify the
jumphosts that bridged the corporate and production environments, the red team
performed reconnaissance within Active Directory and identified a jumphost that
allowed inbound Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) connections. While RDP would require the use of MFA,
access via WMI was not similarly constrained. Using the Domain Administrator
account, the red team queried WMI on the jumphost to identify a list of users
who had recently authenticated to the server. The red team then conducted
DCSync attacks against the list of recently authenticated users to obtain the
NTLM hashes for each account, which were submitted to a Mandiant-internal
password cracking service. The cracking service successfully identified the plain
text credentials of multiple users from the list, giving the red team the first element
needed to authenticate to RDP. While MFA provides a high degree of security
for environments, convenience features that help improve adoption rates are
often built into the products. One such feature is the ability to generate a push
notification on the user’s device and request authorization. Advanced attackers
and red teams alike can use this feature and hope that a busy employee may
assume a request is legitimate and authorize the request.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

79

In this case, the red team initiated a Duo Push request that was accepted by the
end user, which gave the red team interactive access to the jumphost through an
RDP connection. To perform follow-on actions efficiently and move further into
the sensitive production network, the red team needed to place a Cobalt Strike
beacon on the jumphost but firewall policy restricted the transfer of files to the
jumphost. Using a compromised user workstation, the red team temporarily stored
a DLL sideloading payload on a corporate-wide file share which could then be
accessed from the jumphost while the red team was connected through RDP.
With a Cobalt Strike beacon in place, the red team could maintain access to the
jumphost and complete the client’s requested objective.

Outcomes
In this case study, at the client’s request, the Mandiant red team gained a
foothold in the client’s environment, obtained full administrative control of the
company domain, accessed executive email and connected to the sensitive
production network without any software or operating system exploits. Instead,
the red team focused on identifying system misconfigurations, conducting social
engineering attacks and using the client’s internal tools. They were able to achieve
their objectives despite the obstacles presented by the client’s MFA, network
segmentation and employee social engineering awareness.

2020 was a year where we were reminded how events in the physical

on how geopolitical events often have repercussions on cyber security. In 2020
we saw how a global pandemic changed business operations and, as a result,
the attack surface and risk profile of most businesses. Organizations around the
world struggled with adapting to the new norm and maintaining their defenses as
attackers took advantage of these unprecedented times.
Over the past year we were also reminded of the complexity and impact of supply
chain attacks, a trend we first mentioned in M-Trends 2013, where we discussed
how attackers used third-party service providers to compromise their victims.
While many of the trends we have observed in 2020 are not new, we have seen
these issues reach new and memorable levels of sophistication and proportion.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2021

We also witnessed how ransomware evolved to multi-faceted extortion and
continues to escalate. In 2020, we saw the rise of “name and shame” websites
in addition to encryptor deployment. Threat actors capitalized on infrastructure
deployed to support a remote workforce by exploiting new and old vulnerabilities
for initial access. These trends underscore the importance of sound fundamentals
such as vulnerability and patch management, least privilege and hardening.
Security organizations need to continue to be prepared for ongoing escalations
with threat actors and deal with changes to their own environment and attack
surface. While much has stayed the same, we are seeing a continued evolution of
past trends that requires security teams to remain vigilant, adapt and evolve.
