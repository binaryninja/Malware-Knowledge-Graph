For almost a year, an ongoing campaign to infiltrate computer systems throughout the Middle
East has targeted individuals across Iran, Israel, Afghanistan and others scattered across the
globe.
Together with our partner, Seculert, weve thoroughly investigated this operation and named it
the Madi, based on certain strings and handles used by the attackers. You can read the
Seculert analysis post here: http://blog.seculert.com/2012/07/mahdi-cyberwar-savior.html”.
The campaign relied on a couple of well known, simpler attack techniques to deliver the
payloads, which reveals a bit about the victims online awareness. Large amounts of data
collection reveal the focus of the campaign on Middle Eastern critical infrastructure
engineering firms, government agencies, financial houses, and academia. And individuals
within this victim pool and their communications were selected for increased monitoring over
extended periods of time.

This post is an examination of the techniques used to spread the Madi malware to victim
systems, the spyware tools used, and quirks about both. In some cases, targeted
organizations themselves don’t want to provide further breach information about the attack,
so some perspective into the parts of the campaign can be limited.

The Arrival
Social engineering schemes to drop and run spyware
The Madi attackers rely mostly on social engineering techniques to distribute their spyware:

The first of the two social engineering schemes that define spreading activity for this
surveillance campaign is the use of attractive images and confusing themes embodied in
PowerPoint Slide Shows containing the embedded Madi trojan downloaders. An “Activated
Content” PowerPoint effect enables executable content within these spearphish attachments
to be run automatically. These embedded trojan downloaders in turn fetch and install the
backdoor services and related “housekeeping” data files on the victim system. One example,
“Magic_Machine1123.pps”, delivers the embedded executable within a confusing math
puzzle PowerPoint Slide Show where the amount of math instructions may overwhelm a
viewer. Note that while PowerPoint presents users a dialog that the custom animation and
activated content may execute a virus, not everyone pays attention to these warnings or
takes them seriously, and just clicks through the dialog, running the malicious dropper.
Another PowerPoint Slide Show named Moses_pic1.pps walks the viewer through a series
of calm, religious themed, serene wilderness, and tropical images, confusing the user into
running the payload on their system as seen below:

Some of the downloaders also drop and open documents with Middle Eastern news content
and religious themes as well, as seen here.

Social engineering – Right to left override (RTLO) techniques
Like many pieces of this puzzle, most of the components are simple in concept, but effective
in practice. No extended 0-day research efforts, no security researcher commitments or big
salaries were required. In other words, attacking this set of victims without 0-day in this
region works well enough.
In addition to the attractive PowerPoint Slide Shows frequently delivered within password
protected zip archives, the attackers sent out executables maintaining misleading file names
using the publicly known “Right to Left Override” technique. These file names appear to the
user as image files with harmless .jpg extensions, .pdf extensions, or whatever a determined
attacker might craft along with the matching file type icons, leading users to believe they can
just click on what is not a data file, but an executable file.
The issue exists with the way Windows handles Unicode character sets. The technique has
been written up here and here. Madis related incident files included filenames that appeared
on victim systems as “picturcs..jpg”, along with a common .jpg icon. But when that Unicode,
or UTF-8 based filename is copied to an ANSI file, the name is displayed as “pictu?gpj..scr”.
So some Madi victims were tricked into clicking on what they thought was a harmless .jpg,
and instead ran the executable “.scr” file. A screenshot presents an example filename here,
with the flawed Widows explorer display above, and the command line display below:

When executed, these PE droppers will attempt to show misleading images or videos, once
again, tricking the victim into believing nothing is wrong. Heres a video about a missile test:

Finding Presence
The backdoors that were delivered to approximately 800 victim systems were all coded in
Delphi. This would be expected from more amateur programmers, or developers in a rushed
project. Here is a screenshot of the interface for the admins:

The executables are packed with a recent version of the legitimate UPX packer such as UPX
3.07. Unfortunately, that technique and quickly shifting code will get the code past some
gateway security products.
When run, most versions of the dropper create a large volume of files in c:documents and
settingsPrinthood. Along with UpdateOffice.exe or OfficeDesktop.exe (and other variations
on the Office name), hundreds of mostly empty, housekeeping files are created. Heres a
short list of files keeping configuration data:
FIE.dll

Filename extension

xdat.dll

Last check-in date

BIE.dll

Distraction filename extension

7/13

SHK.dll,
nam.dll

Victim directory path prefix (i.e. abamo9 <- this is the operator/handler
name for this victim)

SIK.dll

Domain check-in (i.e. www.maja.in)

Also dropped and opened are any one of several distraction images and documents. One of
the documents is the Jesus image posted above (dropped as encoded content within
Motahare.txt), and one of the documents is a copy and paste job of an article at The Daily
Beast on electronic warfare in the region, which was dropped as encoded content within
Mahdi.txt.

Infostealers are downloaded and run as iexplore.exe from within the templates directory
mentioned above.
Functionality list:

The functionality in the backdoor software mirrors the options present in the configuration
tool. Notice the nine different options:
1. Keylogging
2. Screenshot capture at specified intervals. (see timers below)
3. Screenshot capture at specified intervals, initiated exclusively by a communicationsrelated event. The event may be that the victim is interacting with webmail, an IM client
or social networking site. These triggering sites include Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail,
ICQ, Skype, google+, Facebook and more.
4. Update this backdoor
5. Record audio as .WAV file and save for upload
6. Retrieve any combination of 27 different types of data files
7. Retrieve disk structures
8. Delete and bind these are not fully implemented yet
The various operations of the backdoor are controlled by Delphi Timers, as seen below:

Using a disinfected version of Resource Hacker
It’s common behavior for malware to maintain malicious code in their resource section,
decompress it on the fly and drop it to disk. Or, for attackers to modify the icons of their
RTLO spearphish.
The Madi attackers maintain two copies of ResHacker (see
http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/ ) for distribution on their websites, embedded within
files “SSSS.htm” and “RRRR.htm”. They not only created more noise on the wire by
instructing their malware to download ResHacker, a well known resource section editor, but it
looks like they have had problems with virus infections on their own networks. These copies
differed by one byte. That difference is the value in the SizeofImage section, 0xdc800 in one
file, and 0xde000 in the other. The difference presents itself because both were infected with
Virus.Win32.Parite.b (https://threats.kaspersky.com/en/threat/Virus.Win32.Parite.b) at some
point, and then cleaned by Anti-Virus scanners. So it’s possible and likely that the attackers
are bumbling through infections of their own.

Indicators of compromise
All known compromised systems are known to communicate over HTTP with one of several
web servers, such as: 174.142.57.* (3 servers) and 67.205.106.* (one server).
In addition, ICMP PING packets are sent to these servers to check their status.
The infostealers are downloaded and executed from the c:Documents and
Settings%USER%Templates folder. The downloader itself runs from c:documents and

10/13

settings%USER%Printhood, which may contain over 300 files with .PRI, .dll, and .TMP
extensions. The infostealers are named “iexplore.exe”, while the downloaders maintained
names like UpdateOffice.exe or OfficeDesktop.exe.
At the time of writing, the campaign continues to be in operation and we are working with
various organizations to clean up and prevent further infections. Kaspersky products detect
the malware as Trojan.Win32.Madi.*; some of the older variants are detected as
“Trojan.Win32.Upof.*”.
