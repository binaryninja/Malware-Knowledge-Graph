Introduction
Volon’s Research team observed a spear phishing attack on Ofﬁcials of Indian Ministry of
External Affairs in early August. Crimson RAT was used as attack vector in this instance, same
TTPs were observed by an APT group since 2016.
The email lures the ofﬁcials by asking them to download the MS Excel sheet named “amended
training schedule of IFS ofﬁcers”. The download link provided in the email is shown as
“hxxps://www.mea.gov.in/ifs-traning.schedule”, but it actually points to the malicious XLS
document from URL: hxxp://info-sharing.net/?a=1533541533.
The document contains malicious macro code which drops ﬁrst payload, the dropped payload is
Crimson RAT downloader. This payload further downloads fully functional Crimson RAT from the
following IP: 151.106.19[.]207:8246
A document with similar TTP was also identiﬁed in early august with the name “MoFA-MoD
AFghanistan.xls” uploaded on 3rd August 2018. The XLS ﬁle contains malicious macro code,
which upon execution downloads Payload from URL:”hxxp://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll”
In 2016, Proofpoint published a report on “Operation Transparent Tribe”. The report had details of
various attacks against Indian Embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan using Crimson RAT.
And, in one of the campaigns, they found a XLS ﬁle fetching payload from same URL as we found
in second campaign URL: “hxxp://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll”. These details might indicate that
the APT group behind Operation Transparent Tribe is active and targeting Indian ofﬁcials, again.

The following code is used to parse the commands which payload receives from the C&C:

Following is the list of some of the commands that the payload (Crimson RAT) supports:
1. proc1 – List all the running processes.
2. getavs – List of antiviruses running on the system.
3. ﬁlz – Send ﬁle info to C&C
4. dowf – Download ﬁle from C&C
5. cownr – Update the binary.
6. dirs – Send disk drives list.
7. aﬁle – Send ﬁle to C&C
Apart from above commands, the RAT has more functionalities like keylogging, browser
credential theft and webcam access.
Conclusion
Based on the above campaigns, its TTPs, payload used and past reporting, there is high
probability that the APT group behind “Operation Transparent Tribe” might be active and is
targeting Indian organizations, again.
