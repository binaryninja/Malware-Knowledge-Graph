Mandiant identifies the source of internal network compromise
While Mandiant’s investigation is still ongoing, we now have a clear overall understanding of
the attack. Following our previous update, we would like to share some additional technical
details to support our customers and the community. We have also published additional
indicators of compromise that organizations can leverage for their network defenses.

Initial Intrusion Vector
Mandiant identified the source of our internal network compromise began in 2022 when an
employee installed the Trading Technologies X_TRADER software on the employee’s
personal computer. Although the X_TRADER installation software was downloaded from the
Trading Technologies website, it contained VEILEDSIGNAL malware, which enabled the
threat actor (identified as UNC4736) to initially compromise and maintain persistence on the
employee’s personal computer.
The X_TRADER installer (X_TRADER_r7.17.90p608.exe) was digitally signed by a valid
code signing certificate with the subject of “Trading Technologies International, Inc”. It was
hosted on hxxps://download.tradingtechnologies[.]com. While the X_TRADER software was
reportedly retired in 2020 by Trading Technologies, the software was still available for
download on the Trading Technologies website in 2022. The code signing certificate used to
digitally sign the malicious software was set to expire in October 2022.

Lateral Movement
Following the initial compromise of the employee’s personal computer using VEILEDSIGNAL
malware, Mandiant assesses the threat actor stole the employee's 3CX corporate credentials
from his system. VEILEDSIGNAL is a fully-featured malware that provided the threat actor
with administrator-level access and persistence to the compromised system. The earliest
evidence of compromise uncovered within the 3CX corporate environment occurred through
the VPN using the employee's corporate credentials two days after the employee's personal
computer was compromised.
Additionally, Mandiant identified the use of the Fast Reverse Proxy tool
(https://github.com/fatedier/frp) which the threat actor used to move laterally within the 3CX
environment. The tool was named MsMpEng.exe and located in the C:\Windows\System32
directory.

CI/CD Build Environment Compromise
Mandiant’s investigation was able to reconstruct the threat actor’s steps through our
environment as they harvested credentials and moved laterally. Eventually, the threat actor
was able to compromise both the Windows and macOS build environments. On the Windows
build environment, the attacker deployed the TAXHAUL launcher and COLDCAT downloader
which persisted by performing DLL hijacking for the IKEEXT service and ran with
LocalSystem privileges. The macOS build server was compromised using a POOLRAT
backdoor using LaunchDaemons as a persistence mechanism.

Attribution
Based on the Mandiant investigation into the 3CX intrusion and supply chain attack thus far,
they attribute the activity to a threat actor cluster named UNC4736. Mandiant assesses with
high confidence that UNC4736 has a North Korean nexus.

Going Forward
Our priority throughout this incident has been transparency around what we know as well as
the actions we’ve taken.
As we wind down our incident investigation, 3CX has taken this opportunity to continue to
strengthen our policies, practices, and technology to further protect against future attacks.
With that, we’re announcing a 7 Step Security Action Plan. In this plan, we’re committing to
actionable steps to harden our defenses. You can read in more detail here.
