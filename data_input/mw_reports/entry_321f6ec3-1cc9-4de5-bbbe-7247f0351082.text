ABSTRACT
There is no doubt that there has been an increasing interest in
understanding the industry of social media fraud (SMF) – which
is the process of creating fake ‘likes’ and ‘follows’ on online
social networks (OSN) – and its potential deceptive capabilities.
This paper explores an undocumented segment of this industry:
wholesaling, from botnet supply operations to bulk reselling.
To begin, the paper focuses on a previously unexplored aspect
of Linux/Moose, an IoT botnet conducting SMF. Linux/Moose
infects devices in order to use them as proxies to relay traffic to
social networks. Its architecture includes a whitelist of IP
addresses that can push traffic through those proxies – a feature
reminiscent of a reseller model. We analyse the traffic
fingerprints left by each IP address on the systems we infected
and uncover the value of the whitelisted IPs, which is not what
we had anticipated. Then, we collect information on bulk
reseller panels, the direct working partners of the botnet
operators. While analysing their striking similarities, we
discover a new key actor in the industry: the software panel
seller. We investigate the panels in an attempt to understand how
they are connected to main SMF providers like Linux/Moose.
Finally, we map the SMF supply chain, discuss key actors that, if
targeted, would disrupt the entire industry and show the likely
unequal revenue division in the chain. This is a first review study
of the wholesale industry of SMF. It provides key insights for
actors willing to curb this illicit activity, from law enforcement
agencies to policy makers and cybersecurity professionals.

1. INTRODUCTION
Online social networks (OSN) have become excellent vehicles for
marketing, to gain visibility and subsequent influence. They have
also become a powerful tool for online manipulation, with
erroneous and misleading information being widely distributed on
them. Among other fraudulent practices, buying fake visibility
through an illicit market for social media fraud (SMF) is a
common practice undertaken by many, as reported in journalistic
investigations [1, 2] and studies [3–6]. Such practices seem
benign at first, but fortunately, law enforcement organizations
have started to become aware of the potential for harm they
create, such as information manipulation. In January 2018, the
New York Attorney General launched an investigation against a
social media marketing company, named Devumi, that sold SMF
to a wide variety of customers [1, 2]. The criminal investigation
was set in motion since some of the fake accounts sold

appeared to commit identity theft. Yet, there is much more
criminal activity behind SMF, and customer-facing companies
like Devumi are only the tip of the iceberg. The SMF industry
involves multiple actors all contributing, to a certain degree, to
illicit activities. This explanatory study establishes the link
between these actors, from malware authors to final SMF
customers, bringing key insights for law enforcement
agencies, policy makers and cybersecurity professionals
willing to curb the activity of this illicit industry.
To do so, we start by presenting an Internet of Things (IoT)
botnet, named Linux/Moose, that conducts SMF on Instagram.
We study a specific feature of this main SMF provider and
attempt to understand how orders are managed in the botnet. We
then investigate bulk reseller panels to uncover their middleman
role in this industry. Finally, we uncover the potential supply
chain behind SMF and its key elements to disrupt the industry and
briefly discuss the likely unequal revenue division in the chain.

2. SMF BOTNET: LINUX/MOOSE AND ITS
WHITELIST OF IP ADDRESSES
The production of millions of fake accounts to conduct SMF
requires automation, which can be done through a botnet – a
key actor in the SMF supply chain. Fortunately, in the past two
years, we have investigated such a botnet, named Linux/Moose
[7]. We begin this section by briefly presenting the botnet, the
different steps we undertook to investigate its operations, and
the conclusions we have reached so far (with some already
published).
Linux/Moose infects embedded Linux systems of MIPS or ARM
architectures, specifically avoiding x86, such as routers and IoT
devices. Just like other well-known IoT botnets, it has a
worm-like behaviour, brute forcing Telnet credentials with
simple combinations of usernames and passwords. Its main
payload is a proxy service that can do SOCKSv4/v5, HTTP,
HTTPS, using the infected devices to relay traffic. This allows
the botnet operator(s)1 to hide behind thousands – if not
hundreds of thousands – of clean IP addresses2 [3]. To study
the botnet’s operations, we built honeypots and infected them
with the Linux/Moose malware. We then accessed the
content of the encrypted traffic by performing a man-in-themiddle attack using the mitmproxy tool [8]. The whole
procedure for the honeypots’ creation and infection, as well as
the man‑in‑the‑middle attack on the encrypted traffic, is detailed
in the white paper ‘EGO MARKET: When Greed for Fame
Benefits Large-Scale Botnets’ [3].
Our analysis showed that Linux/Moose’s traffic is directed
towards various OSNs but mainly to Instagram, which represents
86% of the HTTPS requests we studied.3 On Instagram, fake
accounts are created and then leveraged to conduct likes and
follows on various profiles. Cunningly, to ensure that the
fraudulent operations are not caught by the OSN’s anti-bot
algorithms, human-like behaviours are scripted by the

Reputable IP addresses, likely to be used by legitimate consumers as
opposed to data-centre IP addresses.

We use the present tense because we are fairly certain that
Linux/Moose is still active.

operator(s) [4]. During the investigation, the profiles followed by
the botnet were identified as belonging mainly to members of the
entertainment industry (e.g. actors/actresses, singers,
newscasters/talk show hosts), small online shops and ordinary
people, illustrating that the demand for fake online popularity is
vast. For further information, we published a market price
analysis of SMF, an evaluation of the botnet’s behaviour on
Instagram and a profile of the potential customers of such fraud
in the conference paper: ‘Can We Trust Social Media Data?
Social Network Manipulation by an IoT Botnet’ [4].
The element of interest in this study, which has not yet been
published or discussed, is the botnet’s distinct use of a whitelist
of IP addresses. This whitelist controls who can interact with
the bots’ proxy and is provided in the regular beacon messages
between infected hosts and the command-and-control (C&C)
servers. Throughout our monitoring of infected hosts, the
whitelist remained the same, containing seven IP addresses.
Table 1 shows where each of them is hosted.

thus potentially seven (or fewer) actors – could log in and use
the botnet’s infected devices to conduct SMF. This would be a
good way to delegate some control to an external actor (partner)
without giving that person too much access, thus preventing the
botnet from being stolen. We present below the results of our
analysis, which does not support the reseller hypothesis, but
rather shows a different picture. The analysis involves looking at
the traffic fingerprints left by each whitelisted IP address in both
the packet capture data (Pcaps) and the mitmproxy logs
(decrypted HTTPS traffic) on our ten honeypots. Due to the
amount of data to process, data visualization4 was required to
find patterns in the traffic. The two subsections below
summarize the different findings.

2.1 The similarities in traffic fingerprints of each
whitelisted IP address
The results of the five analyses below did not confirm our
hypothesis but rather refuted it. They show many similarities
in the traffic fingerprints of each whitelisted IP address,
forcing us to assume that they are probably controlled by the
same actor.

2.1.1 Honeypots used

Table 1: IP hosting providers.
While scanning these whitelisted IP addresses, we found that
they were Windows servers with their Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) open, indicating that Linux/Moose could hypothetically
be built on a reseller model in which seven distinct servers – and

We looked to see if each honeypot, depending on where it was
hosted in the world, was related to a specific IP address in the
whitelist. However, as shown in Figure 1, we found no
distinctive patterns: each IP sent traffic to almost all honeypots,
regardless of where they were hosted in the world.

2.1.2 TLS fingerprints
We then analysed the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
fingerprints of each whitelisted IP address to see if different
underlying technologies were used by each of them. TLS
fingerprints can be found in ‘client hello’ connections, which
is where the connection handshake takes place between the

client and the server to find the adequate cryptographic
elements that will be used during the connection [10]. In this
study, all whitelisted IP addresses used, in most of their
connection handshakes, the same TLS fingerprints, except
for one. We could not find any distinctive patterns.
Furthermore, the TLS fingerprints were not associated with
specific libraries or browsers, leading us to a dead end.

phone, library and application types. Most of the UserAgents were used in batches of a few dozen requests,
following the scripted patterns for account or friendship/like
creations on each OSN. We concluded that the botnet
operator(s) are most likely using a tool to randomly spoof the
User-Agents in the HTTP headers and that this tool is used
consistently throughout all whitelisted IP addresses.

2.1.3 Websites targeted

2.1.5 API calls

We probed the IP addresses from the whitelist to find out if each
was specialized in conducting SMF on a single OSN. Yet, as
shown in Figure 2, no specialization was found, as each IP
address sent traffic to various OSNs.

Finally, we looked at the way the OSN API was used by each
whitelisted IP address, focusing on Instagram (the main OSN
targeted by Linux/Moose). We found that all IP addresses in the
whitelist used either the REST or the AJAX API alternatively,
with the same sequence of actions imitating humans, as
discussed in another study we published [4]. This indicates an
identical modus operandi among all whitelisted IP addresses.

2.1.4 User-Agents
We investigated the User-Agent component of each HTTP
header, thinking that each actor behind the whitelisted IP
addresses could have used different fake User-Agents. We
found 3,952 different User-Agents all used by the seven
whitelisted IP addresses and varying in terms of browser,

2.2 Linux/Moose’s use of the whitelist
Fortunately, the analysis of three key variables – timestamps,
Instagram accounts followed and Instagram accounts created –

enlightened us as to the use of the whitelist, which is for fake
account management. We also found that three specific IP
addresses were active until the end of April 2016, at which point
three others took over. This indicated that the operator(s) shifted
from one group of active IP whitelisted addresses to another (but
left them all in the whitelist).

2.2.1 Timestamps
By graphing the requests over the whole period of study
(approximately one year), we found that the seven IP addresses
in the whitelist were not used at the same time during that year.
Figure 3 shows that some whitelisted IP addresses were active
only at the beginning of the study, while others became active
only a few months later.
Figure 4 depicts a zoom of Figure 3 for the months of April and
May 2016, illustrating that our honeypots received requests
from whitelisted IP1, IP2 and IP3 until the end of April 2016,
after which requests were received from whitelisted IP5, IP6
and IP7. Only IP4 was used by the botnet before and after the
end of April 2016 for a short period of time. This grouping also
matches the distribution in hosting services per IP addresses
presented in Table 1. From these findings, we could infer two
potential events: either a change in resellers had been made or
there had been a shift from one group of active whitelisted IP
addresses to another (even though all IP addresses remained in
the whitelist for the length of the study). The latter turned out to
be the most plausible, due to the analysis below.

2.2.2 Instagram accounts followed
We looked at the Instagram accounts followed by each IP
address in the whitelist and found that many requests aimed at
following a specific account were coming from more than one
whitelisted IP address. Moreover, we found Instagram
accounts followed by both the whitelisted IP addresses active
before the end of April 2016 and the ones that were active

after. This led us to conclude that the findings in the timestamp
analysis most likely showed a change in infrastructure from
one set of whitelisted IP addresses to another, rather than a
change in SMF resellers.

2.2.3 Instagram accounts created
Finally, we investigated the fake accounts created and leveraged
to conduct SMF and found that they did not overlap among each
whitelisted IP address. Indeed, each IP address in the whitelist
had its own unique set of fake accounts. Furthermore, a given
fake account was consistently used through the same infected
host. This means that, from the point of view of Instagram, a
fake user always connected to its network from the same IP
address – a usage pattern a lot more credible than bouncing
around several IP addresses in a botnet.
As mentioned earlier, the whitelisted IP addresses are running
Windows Server and exposing RDP for remote management.
Also, in the case of Instagram, although each whitelisted IP
address manages a set of fake accounts, there is an overlap in
the accounts being followed by the botnet (the potential
customers of SMF). This leads us to think that a rather
sophisticated proxy-aware Instagram fat-client is used to
manage the fake accounts and the flows of interaction with
Instagram. Confirming the exact fat-client that is used by this
actor will, however, require further research.
The above analysis allowed us to understand the use of the IP
addresses in the whitelist and better clarify the botnet’s
production process. We now look at other actors involved in the
SMF supply chain: reseller panels. These actors were
discovered in a previous piece of research [4] that aimed at
profiling the demand for SMF by investigating Instagram SMF
customer profiles found in Linux/Moose’s traffic. Some of the
Instagram profiles followed by the botnet advertised SMF
reseller panels, such as http://cheapbulksocial.com/, illustrating
that a link exists between these two actors.

3. INVESTIGATING RESELLER PANELS
This section presents our brief analysis of reseller panels, which
can be considered as the middle-man in the supply chain,
connecting customer-facing sellers, like the social media
marketing company Devumi [11], to main SMF providers, like
Linux/Moose. We start by presenting the data collection and the
different analytical steps taken to evaluate the striking
similarities in reseller panels that brought us to uncover a key
actor in the supply chain: software panel sellers. We then
investigate software panels in an attempt to understand how they
can be linked to the whitelisted IP addresses.

3.1 Data collection
To evaluate these actors, we started by collecting information,
searching web pages containing keywords about SMF
wholesaling, such as ‘smm bulk’, ‘smm panel’ and ‘smm
reseller’ (‘smm’ for social media marketing). We also translated
the keywords in Arabic, Turkish, Spanish and Russian to
enhance the number of panels found. We discovered a total of
735 web pages that could be related to SMF wholesaling. We
went through each of them manually to determine whether the
web page was an actual reseller panel or something else. Out of
these 735 web pages, 343 were up and represented what we
were seeking, as shown in Figure 5.

reselling. To test this hypothesis, we gathered WHOIS data,
certificate information, a fingerprint of the web application
(framework, programming language, web container/server), IP
addresses and HTML content for each of these 343 web pages
and attempted to find similarities in the panels by clustering the
data through various methods.
The clustering did not yield much in the way of results, except for
one large cluster. We found that 226 web pages (66% of the
dataset) were coded in PHP, used similar combinations of
client‑side JavaScript libraries (including jQuery, Moment.js,
Underscore.js, Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome) and were
hosted on the same IP address belonging to OVH. This OVH IP
address was running an Ngnix server on which, according to a
query made with the RiskIQ PassiveTotal Community platform
[12] on 17 July 2018, 977 other domains were hosted. Just
glancing at these 977 domains revealed that most of them were
related to SMF bulk reselling due to keywords in them, such as
‘smmpanel’, ‘cheapsmmservices’ or ‘bulkfollows’. While visiting
them, we found that they were indeed reseller panels with similar
login pages, but customized differently (branding, bootstrap
themes, pictures, etc.) and showing some variances in prices.

3.2 Similarities in reseller panels: software panel
sellers

Further investigation of the domains led us to one that
advertised the sale of a software panel. The service offered an
‘All-in-one solution for reselling or providing SMM services’,
including web hosting and panel maintenance. To use the
service, one would only need to own a domain and pay a
monthly price based on the number of orders made, ranging
from 50 USD up to 200 USD per month.

Many of the 343 web pages looked similar, raising our first
assumption that a small number of actors could be behind SMF

Moreover, the panel demo available on the website was similar
to most of the domains we visited that were hosted on the OVH

IP address. This OVH IP address could represent the activity of
a software panel seller and the multiple clients who have bought
the service. To confirm this, we correlated the reCAPTCHA
SiteKey found in the signup page of the software panel seller
with the ones found in the signup pages of the active domains
hosted on the OVH IP address. On 17 July 2018, 486 websites
were up and were accepting signups (out of the 977 domains
hosted on the OVH IP address), and from them, 99% used the
same reCAPTCHA SiteKey as the one found in the web page of
the software panel seller. This allowed us to confirm that the
cluster found in the data represented a software panel seller and
its related clients.
While investigating the 117 web pages from our first dataset
that were not hosted on the OVH IP address, we discovered that
the cluster found above was not an outlier: there are several
software panel sellers available online and they have many
clients who all have similar panels. In total, through a similar
analysis, we found approximately 1,500 reseller panels and five
software panel sellers, three of them offering hosting. For
research reproducibility, we published the list of reseller panels
and software panel sellers online [13].
Finally, our earlier assumption that only a few actors are behind
reseller panels was proven false: there are rather a lot of
resellers in the industry, all of them enabled through software
panel sellers. The latter are, without question, key actors in the
industry, providing panels to those who want to get involved in
bulk SMF reselling, but who do not have the technological skills
required to build efficient panels.

3.3 From SMF reseller panels to main providers
We tried to find the direct link between SMF reseller panels and
main providers, like Linux/Moose. We looked at features
offered by three panel software sellers and purchased the service
from one of them. We also visited threads on the Black Hat
World forum related to SMF reselling, to see if we could find
any clues as to how resellers find their main providers and how
they connect their panels for automated order processing.
We discovered that all software panels provide API access for
customers to automatically send orders to them and offer the
possibility to complete the received orders manually or use an
API to automate the process. The ‘automated order processing’

6

PAPER PRESENTED AT VB2018 MONTREAL

API is, however, not linked to a provider. Reseller panel owners
need to find their own provider(s). Two software panel sellers
mentioned the following feature: ‘Automatically Place Orders
To Other SMM Reseller Panels’. Resellers can thus connect
their panel to other reseller panels and act as an added
middle‑man in the SMF supply process. Discussions on the
infamous Black Hat World forum did show that, indeed, many
resellers are looking for one or multiple main SMF provider(s)
[14–17], but just end up connecting to other, cheaper panels, as
suggested in the comment [17] shown in Figure 6.
Unfortunately, apart from the possibility of using another
reseller panel’s API to fulfil orders, we did not discover how
reseller panels fulfilled orders automatically through a main
SMF provider. We could not establish the direct link between
reseller panels and botnets like Linux/Moose. We know they
are related, since some SMF reseller panels were found in
the Instagram accounts followed by Linux/Moose’s traffic.
However, the whitelisted IP addresses only had RDP open and
thus cannot receive automated API requests from reseller
panels. We see two possibilities for them to connect: either
the whitelisted IP addresses’ aforementioned fat-client
fetches the orders by itself or an RDP tunnel is created between
the client (such as the OVH IP address) and the whitelisted IP
address servers. However, further investigation is needed.

4. THE INDUSTRY OF SOCIAL MEDIA FRAUD
Drawing from our findings, we present the potential SMF
supply chain, discuss the link between the actors and examine
the key ones that could disrupt the industry. We finally provide
some insights on the division of revenue in the chain, which
seems to be quite unequal.

4.1 The supplying process
Understanding the purpose of Linux/Moose’s whitelist, as well
as evaluating reseller panels, gave us an interesting overview of
the potential SMF supply process, a representation of which is
shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7 represents the supply chain from an SMF provider, like
the botnet Linux/Moose where the service is produced, up to
where the service is sold directly to customers. There are, of
course, other potential supply chains. For example, reseller

panels or customer-facing sellers may make their own bot
scripts, complete their orders manually, or send their orders to
click-farms (large groups of low-paid labourers that conduct
SMF manually [18]). Yet, this representation of the supply chain
is the most probable one that emanates from this research.
Customer-facing sellers are easily accessible through online
searches, as discussed in previous studies of Linux/Moose
[3, 4]. They sell SMF services to customers and most likely
buy in bulk afterwards from reseller panels. Devumi, a
customer-facing company currently under criminal
investigation [2], was also assumed to buy in bulk: ‘[...]
Devumi does not appear to make its own bots. Instead, the
company buys them wholesale – from a thriving global
market of fake social media accounts.’ [2]
According to this investigation, reseller panels can be linked
either to a cheaper panel or to a main provider (through a
process not yet uncovered in the case of Linux/Moose). The
panel can also be bought from software panel sellers who enable
hundreds, if not thousands, of non-technical resellers to get
involved in SMF wholesaling. This undoubtedly increases the
level of competition among reseller panel owners.
Yet, even though there are more resellers, access to main
providers seems to be protected, as software panel sellers do not
provide a direct link to them and many resellers on the Black
Hat World forum ask how main SMF providers can be found.
There is no doubt that main SMF providers, like Linux/Moose,
avoid any public visibility due to the criminal aspect of their
activity. They seem to hide behind multiple actors, staying at the
end of the supply chain and dealing only with trusted partners.

4.2 Disrupting the SMF industry
One could decide to disrupt the SMF industry by taking down
the main providers in the supply chain – botnets – as they are
the ones involved in criminal activities. Yet, such action is a
lengthy task that requires technical skills and international
cooperation among law enforcement agencies [19]. Other actors
in the supply chain are key and may be easier to stop: software
panel resellers and reseller panels. These actors enable the link
between customer-facing vendors and main SMF providers.

Moreover, by putting an end to the activities of software panel
sellers, a large portion of the currently available panels would
disappear. This could make the current pyramid scheme
crumble and negatively impact many other resellers. Such
action would, however, require a thorough criminal
investigation of the potential illicit activities behind the panels
hosted by software panel sellers, since many options (some of
them more licit than others) are available for their associated
reseller panels to fulfil orders. Nonetheless, software panel
sellers are fundamental to the SMF supply chain: they are the
bridge between the non‑technical actors (many reseller panels
and customer-facing sellers) in the industry and the real
cybercriminals behind botnets. Plus, they are not difficult to
find as they hide in plain sight.
An easier option would be for the OSNs themselves to go after
panel hosters on breach of their ‘Terms of Use’ instead of going
through the criminal route. The timing might be perfect given
the political incentives to get rid of online manipulation on
OSNs. However, taking panel hosters down might just get
everyone into a whack-a-mole scenario where these actors
would start hosting their activities on bulletproof hosting
providers or compromised servers, reminiscent of what
happened with botnet C&C servers.

4.3 Unequal revenue division in the supply chain
Lastly, let’s briefly discuss the unequal revenue division found
in this supply chain. Indeed, based on a previous study that
gathered information on SMF prices of customer-facing sellers
[4], the medium price for 1,000 followers on Instagram is
estimated at 13 USD5. On reseller panels, we gathered SMF
prices for 58 panels, keeping the lowest and the highest prices
for 1,000 Instagram followers on each panel6. The prices found
varied between 0.17 USD (cheap followers) and 15 USD
(assumed to be non-drop followers with a specific gender or
nationality) for 1,000 Instagram followers, with a mean price of
2.74 USD (std=3.30) and a median price of 1 USD. Considering

We take the medium price because the average has a high standard of
deviation.

the medium prices of Instagram followers for customer-facing
sellers and reseller panels, if no other costs are incurred, the
former would make a profit of 12 USD for selling 1,000
followers, leading to a net profit margin of 92%. This means
that for each dollar invested, customer-facing sellers would
receive a net income of 92 cents, a return on investment that is
lofty.

On the other hand, such a high profit margin for customer‑facing
sellers also indicates that reseller panel owners and main SMF
providers share a very small portion of what the customer paid
for the service. Their profit most likely comes from selling in
bulk, as is the case for most producers at the beginning of a
supply chain. Yet, for reseller panels, the competition may be
quite fierce with many reseller panels available thanks to
software panel sellers.

In this paper, we have uncovered the potential SMF supply
chain and discussed the operations of multiple actors involved.
Further research is, however, required to better understand the
dynamics that link each actor in the supply chain. For example,
how many reseller panels link their panels to others and how
many have direct access to main SMF providers? Are some
reseller panels more successful than others, and if so, why?
Also, we still have not found how reseller panels are linked to
Linux/Moose’s whitelisted IP addresses.

Black Hat World. 2017. Who can tell me the SMM
service provider panel rather than the reseller panel?

Also, this indicates that main SMF providers earn a very small
amount of money for each follower created and sold, as many
actors in the supply chain take a large part of the revenue pie. If
this business was legal, SMF providers could integrate vertically
and own the whole supply chain, allowing them to absorb the
profit margin from other actors. Yet, the illicit aspect of their
activity forces them to stay in the shadow and earn less per
follower produced.
Lastly, software panel sellers offering hosting seem to have an
alluring business. For every panel they host, they earn a fee
per month, ensuring recurring business from their customers.
The fee, at the time of writing, was around 25 USD to 200
USD per month, depending on the number of orders completed
on the panel. With these fees, few subscriptions are needed to
start making an interesting amount of money. For example,
hosting 100 panels at a minimum of 25 USD would give a
revenue of 2,500 USD per month. Considering that the OVH
IP address hosted 977 domains (not all of them active,
however), this software panel seller may make an interesting
monthly revenue.

Still, this research is part of a two-year-long investigation that
attempts to place a botnet’s operations in its economic context,
understanding the ecosystem in which it evolves. This specific
study is a first review of the wholesale industry of SMF and
provides key insights for actors willing to curb these fraudulent
activities.
