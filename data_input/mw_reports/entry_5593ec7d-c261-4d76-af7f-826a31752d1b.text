Two weeks ago, news broke about strategic web
compromise (SWC) activity on the website for the U.S.
organization, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). This
activity leveraged exploit code for a zero-day
vulnerability now identified as CVE-2014-0322 and
ultimately infected victims with ZxShell malware.
CrowdStrike Intelligence attributed this attack to the
AURORA PANDA adversary; however, the discovery of
additional indicators revealed that another adversary

was leveraging the same vulnerability to carry out
targeted attacks nearly a month before the VFW attack
occurred. This other activity appears to be focused on
French aerospace and shares similarities with a 2012
SWC campaign affecting the website of U.S.-based
turbine manufacturer, Capstone Turbine.
GIFAS-Related Activity
CrowdStrike Intelligence became aware of this
additional activity after learning of a malicious iframe
located at savmpet[.]com. The iframe redirected
visitors to gifas[.]assso[.]net, which was hosting
exploit code in two files (include.html and Tope.swf )
as well as a malicious payload (Erido.jpg).

Above are screenshots of the savmpet[.]com webpage
and part of the page source showing the date that it was
last modified and the iframe redirect. The content of
the page was taken from the website of the French
aerospace industries association, Groupement des
industries françaises aéronautiques et spatiales
(GIFAS). The 17 January 2014 date on both the
webpage and the page source shows that it was created
nearly a month before the VFW attack occurred

Victim exploitation occurred in the same manner as in
the VFW activity, but the payload was different.
Instead of ZxShell malware connecting to AURORA
PANDA-related infrastructure, it was a malware
variant known as Sakula connecting to command-andcontrol (C2) infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.
French Aerospace Focus
This attack’s most obvious connection to French
aerospace is the content taken from the GIFAS website
and the GIFAS-based domain used to host the exploit
code and payload (gifas[.]assso[.]net). However, a more
in-depth look reveals additional connections.
First is the IP address 173.252.252.204, which hosted
both savmpet[.]com and gifas[.]assso[.]net. Several
other domains were also pointed at this IP during the
same time frame, including two that contained the
same content and malicious iframe as savmpet[.]com,
secure[.]safran-group[.]com, and icbcqsz[.]com.
Of particular interest was secure[.]safran-group[.]com.
Safran is a France-based aerospace and defense
company with a focus on the design and production of

aircraft engines and equipment. The company owns
the safran-group[.]com domain, and the fact that one of
its subdomains was pointed at a malicious IP address
suggests that the adversary compromised Safran’s
DNS.
The Sakula malware used in this attack contained an
unusual and interesting component that further
indicates a focus on French aerospace. As part of the
infection process, it added a number of domains to the
“host’s” file of victim machines.

The snecma[.]fr domain belongs to the Safran
subsidiary, Snecma, that designs and builds engines for
civilian and military aircraft, and spacecraft. The

domains listed appear to provide remote access to the
company’s employees and possibly third-party
contractors.
The purpose of this component is unclear. It does not
map these domains to malicious IP addresses because
the 217.108.170.0/24 range belongs to the company,
which means it is not meant to send victims directly to
adversary infrastructure for credential collection. One
possibility is that it was meant to make the malware
appear more legitimate. It has also been
hypothesized that this was done to ensure DNS
connectivity to these particular domains; however, it
seems unlikely that victims would suffer significant
DNS connectivity issues, which means that adding this
component to the malware for that purpose would be
somewhat superfluous.
It should be noted that no victim logs related to this
attack were discovered, so it is unclear who the actual
targets and victims were. Having the secure[.]safrangroup[.]com domain pointed at a malicious IP indicates
that Safran suffered a DNS compromise, but no deeper
network compromise was observed. It is possible that

the adversary desired to target the French aerospace
and defense sectors broadly, or possibly organizations
in these sectors globally.
Similarities to 2012 Capstone Turbine SWC Attack
In January 2013, it was reported that the website for
U.S.-based turbine manufacturer, Capstone Turbine,
had been compromised and was being used in a SWC
attack leveraging an exploit for the CVE-2012-4792.
There are three primary similarities between the
Capstone Turbine attack and the recent French
aerospace activity.
The first, and most significant, connection is the use of
Sakula malware. In both campaigns, Sakula variants
were installed on successfully exploited machines. In
Capstone Turbine, the Sakula sample used (MD5 hash:
61fe6f4cb2c54511f0804b1417ab3bd2) connected to
web[.]vipreclod[.]com, and in the recent attack, the
sample (MD5 hash:
c869c75ed1998294af3c676bdbd56851) connected to
oa[.]ameteksen[.]com. Use of this malware doesn’t

appear to be widespread, but it is not yet clear whether
only one group uses it, and therefore its use alone does
not necessarily indicate a particular adversary.
Another similarity is that GIFAS-based malicious
domains are related to each incident. In the more
recent attack, the gifas[.]assso[.]net domain was used
to host exploit code and the malicious payload. The
Capstone Turbine incident did not directly use a
GIFAS-based domain, but a deeper look at network
indicators related to those observed in the Capstone
incident reveals two such domains:
gifas[.]cechire[.]com and gifas[.]blogsite[.]org.

The third similarity between the two is the use of zerodays. The exploit used in Capstone Turbine was a zeroday during the time it was active, just like the exploit
used in the recent French aerospace activity. This is a
general similarity that does not create a definitive link
between the two attacks, but when viewed in
conjunction with the use of the same malware and
GIFAS-based domains, it strengthens the connection.
