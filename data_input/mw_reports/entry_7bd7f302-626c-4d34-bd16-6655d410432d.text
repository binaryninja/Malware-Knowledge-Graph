===================================

Autolisp is a programming language for AutoCAD. Lisp sourcecode files have the extension
LSP and the compiled Lisp-scripts FAS. This program will decrypt the resource part of fas
and fsl files (write it to disk) and disassemble the it. With help of the disassembling you can

see exactly :) what the program does, how thing are done and you can change some things
with help of a Hexeditor.

Keys:
Enter, Space, double click on a line to jump to a offset that is in the Disasm Like "Goto 0213"
Backspace, Num'-' to go back to old offset
Â´(key beside Backspace), Num'+' to go forward

Getting FSL-Files
All internal lisp programs of Visuallisp are store in the resource section of vllib.dll (or vl.arx in
Autocad LT). Use "Resource Hacker" or "Exescope" to dump these resources to disk and
rename them to *.fsl.

FAS to LSP-Files
The data from the decompiler colum it written to some *_.lsp. However decompiler is far from
being perfect. I really advice you to always also open the *.txt which contains all information.

Editing FAS-Files
For this purpose enable [HexWorkShop] and click some item. Fas-Dis will start
HexWorkShop jump there in via sendkey. Sending keystrokes to another program is a little
fragile. For best results place the HexWorkShop Window beside Fas-Dis's main window and
avoid overlapping. Also take care for possible editing the fas file by error. When asked to
'Save changes'. Click NO! In HexWorkShop options enable 'Highlight changes' to better see
unintented changes. Use HWorks UNDO to revert changes.
When hexediting fas-files maybe this two commands come in handy:
No Operation Good for deleting (= Nop out) unwanted instructions Bytecode: 20h (Just
Space) [or 62 or 63] Parameters: none
short Jump to offset Good for jumping over unwanted instructions i.e. Fix Conditional Jump
(=IF) Bytecode: 0Fh [57h for FAR Jump] Size: 3 Byte [5 Byte] Parameters: 1 Word 2 Bytes
[Dword 4 Bytes] specify Bytes to Skip Example: '0F 0000' will point to the next instruction
after jmp
When doing changes pay attention about the stack being embalenced. In case there are
errors after editing - Decompiled the edited Fas again to check/fix possible stack corruptions.

At the moment there is no documentation file for fas-commands. To get more information
about the command please look at the function 'InterpretStream()' in FasFile.cls and learn
from the fas-disassembling.

Some specifications about the Fas-format are here:
