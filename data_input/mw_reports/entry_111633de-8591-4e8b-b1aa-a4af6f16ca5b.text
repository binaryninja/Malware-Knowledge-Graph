BlueBravo Uses Ambassador
Lure to Deploy
GraphicalNeutrino Malware
CTA-RU-2023-0126

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Executive Summary
BlueBravo is a threat group tracked by Recorded Future’s Insikt Group that overlaps with the Russian
advanced persistent threat (APT) activity tracked as APT29 and NOBELIUM. APT29 and NOBELIUM
operations have been previously attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), an
organization responsible for foreign espionage, active measures, and electronic surveillance. In October
2022 we identified BlueBravo staging GraphicalNeutrino malware within a malicious ZIP file. The staging
and deployment of this ZIP file overlaps with the previously employed dropper EnvyScout, the use of
which is linked to APT29 and NOBELIUM.
BlueBravo used a compromised website containing the text "Ambassador`s schedule November 2022"
as part of a lure operation. Based on the theme of this lure, we suspect that the targets of this
campaign are related to embassy staff or an ambassador. This targeting profile aligns with previous
reporting from InQuest in early 2022 that describes the group, reported as NOBELIUM, employing a lure
document titled “Ambassador_Absense.docx” that displayed content relating to the Embassy of Israel.
Following deployment and execution, InQuest reported that the malware, BEATDROP, employed
trello[.]com for command-and-control (C2) in an attempt to evade detection and create challenges in
attributing the activity.
Similar to the use of Trello for data exchange by BEATDROP, we have found that GraphicalNeutrino uses
the United States (US)-based, business automation service Notion for its C2. The use of the Notion
service by BlueBravo is a continuation of their previous tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as
they have employed multiple online services such as Trello, Firebase, and Dropbox in an attempt to
evade detection. The abuse of legitimate services, such as those employed by BlueBravo, presents a
complex issue for network defenders due to the difficulty of defending against malicious access to
legitimate services. The use of this technique is becoming more common and will continue to pose a
problem for network defenders.
GraphicalNeutrino acts as a loader with basic C2 functionality and implements numerous anti-analysis
techniques including API unhooking, dynamically resolving APIs, string encryption, and sandbox
evasion. It leverages Notion’s API for C2 communications and uses Notion’s database feature to store
victim information and stage payloads for download.
While we are unable to assess the intended targets of this operation based on the data available, it is
likely that ambassadorial or embassy-themed lures are particularly effective during periods of
heightened geopolitical tensions, such as is the case with the ongoing war in Ukraine. During such
periods, Russian APT groups are highly likely to make extensive use of diplomatically themed lures, as
the information potentially gathered from the compromise of entities or individuals receiving such
communications is likely to have a direct impact on Russia’s foreign policy and broader Russian strategic
decision-making processes.
Based on historical APT29 and SVR cyber operations and active measures, we assess it is likely that
additional countries at the nexus of the conflict are at risk of targeting. This targeting almost certainly

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
represents an ongoing interest from threat actors affiliated with the SVR and aligns with their continued
intent to gain access to strategic information from entities and organizations engaged in foreign policy.
Any country with a nexus to the Ukraine crisis, particularly those with key geopolitical, economic, or
military relationships with Russia or Ukraine, are at increased risk of targeting.

Key Judgments

●

●
●

●
●

We have identified new malware used by BlueBravo, which overlaps with Russian APT activity
tracked as APT29 and NOBELIUM, which Western governments and researchers have linked to
the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).
Identified staging infrastructure continues the trend of using compromised websites to deliver
BlueBravo malware within archive files. The delivery of these files uses the same HTML
smuggling technique as EnvyScout.
The malware also takes advantage of DLL search order hijacking for execution, helping to evade
detection on the host.
A change to Notion as the initial C2 from Trello, Firebase, and Dropbox demonstrates BlueBravo’s
broadening but continued use of legitimate Western services to blend their malware traffic to
evade detection.
Though no second-stage malware, follow-on C2 server, or victims were identified, the initial lure
page suggests BlueBravo’s targeting was related to unknown embassy staff or an ambassador.
Embassy-related information is likely considered high value intelligence, especially in the midst
of the Russian war in Ukraine.

Background
BlueBravo’s targeting, its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and its targeting interests and
operations overlap with Russian advanced persistent threat activity publicly reported as APT29 and
NOBELIUM, which has been previously attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The
SVR is responsible for foreign espionage, active measures, and electronic surveillance. APT29 has been
active since at least 2008 according to third-party reporting, engaging in espionage operations against
entities associated with security and defense, politics, and research. APT29 was initially observed
surveilling Chechen and dissident organizations but expanded to target entities in the West such as the
Pentagon in 2015, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and US think tanks in 2016, and the
Norwegian government and several Dutch ministries in 2017.
In 2021, public reporting detailed BlueBravo’s use of various iterations of a phishing campaign emulating
government entities. The various campaigns delivered ISO files via methods such as using URLs to
download the ISO file and execute an LNK file, and using an HTML attachment in the email to initiate
the download of an ISO file. This activity was used to deploy NativeZone, an umbrella term for their
custom Cobalt Strike loaders. NativeZone typically uses rundll32.exe to load and execute follow-on
payload(s).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
BlueBravo employs a wide range of custom malware and open-source tooling. A notable facet is their
evolving malware families and development practices, with implants developed in various languages
including Python, Go, PowerShell, and Assembly.

Technical Analysis
Infrastructure
On October 25, 2022, we identified the domain totalmassasje[.]no delivering the malicious ZIP file
“schedule.zip” via the webpage “schedule.php”. This webpage contains lure text masquerading as an
“Ambassador`s schedule” for the month of November, shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 : Screenshot of hxxps[:]//totalmassasje[.]no/schedule[.]php (Source: URLScan)

Contained within the HTML of the webpage is an obfuscated ZIP file that is deployed via HTML
smuggling as shown in Figure 2; the ZIP file is set to auto-download when the website is visited.

Figure 2 : Screenshot of HTML content (with the array of decimal values of obfuscated payload abbreviated with the use of
“......”) (Source: URLScan)

Analysis of the webpage’s HTML and JavaScript identified close overlap with EnvyScout, a dropper first
noted by Microsoft. Additionally, lines 14-35 are structurally identical to Unit42’s reporting on the same
technique, with only lines 15 and 21 changing using a different deprecated integer and filename.
Lines 13-16 show a for-loop routine used to subtract the integer 6 from each decimal value within the
variable “d” which deobfuscates the malicious ZIP payload “schedule.zip”.
We believe that the domain totalmassasje[.]no is not actor-owned but has been compromised, which
aligns with related reporting of similar activity.

be version 14.30.30704.0; however, a comparison with the legitimate version of the DLL (SHA256:
081a273ad809f650ebaeb91c11fcc7a1ad91232a7228f8e98b52191fe44cb06d) reveals that the file has
been modified. A side-by-side comparison of each DLL’s Properties window is shown in Figure 6 with
the legitimate version on the left and the modified version on the right. Notably, the modified version
has also removed Microsoft’s digital signature.

Figure 6: Comparison of the legitimate (left) and modified (right) versions of vcruntime140.dll (Source: Recorded Future)

Further comparison of the DLL files revealed that an additional library import for 7za.dll had been added
to the modified version. When the file november_schedulexe.pdf is executed, it takes advantage of DLL
search order hijacking to load vcruntime140.dll as a dependency, which in turn requires
vcruntime140.dll to load 7za.dll as a dependency as well. A modified version of vcruntime140.dll to
import another DLL within the same folder has previously been seen and reported by Unit42, and was
observed alongside EnvyScout. The same file version (14.30.30704.0) was also used in the
vcruntime140.dll file described by Unit42.

7za.dll
The file 7za.dll is BlueBravo's intended malicious file — “GraphicalNeutrino”. This DLL leverages Notion’s
API to perform C2 communications via a Notion database and to deliver additional payloads to the

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
victim’s machine. The DLL is written in C++ and contains only 1 export function (DeviceAll), which
simply returns when called. The actual malicious code is implemented in a thread that is spawned in
DLLMain during the DLL’s initialization. Multiple anti-analysis and evasion techniques are used
throughout the malware including API unhooking, dynamically resolving APIs, string encryption, and
sandbox evasion.
When GraphicalNeutrino starts a thread, it attempts to remove any API hooks in the ntdll and wininet
modules. The unhooking technique used is identical to the one described in an ired.team notes article,
and is summarized as follows:
1. Maps a clean copy of the module into memory from the file system
2. Locates the .text section in both the original and clean copies of the module
3. Modifies the module’s original .text section permission to be PAGE_READWRITE_EXECUTE and
stores the original permissions
4. Copies the clean module’s .text section over the original module’s .text section, effectively
removing any API hooks
5. Reapplies the original permissions to the original module’s .text section
Next, GraphicalNeutrino checks to see if it should establish persistence. It dynamically loads the
legitimate Windows modules psapi.dll and advapi.dll to resolve addresses for
GetProcessImageFileNameA, RegOpenKeyExA, RegQueryValueExA, RegSetValueExA, and RegCloseKey.
It then checks to see if its process filename matches “7za.exe”; if it does, then it copies 7za.exe,
7za.dll, and vcruntime140.dll to %APPDATA_LOCAL%\7za and creates the registry key
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\7za with a value of
%APPDATA_LOCAL%\7za\7za.exe. This enables GraphicalNeutrino to be executed again when the
victim machine is rebooted; however, in this particular sample, persistence is not established because
the process filename is november_schedulexe.pdf instead of 7za.exe.
Throughout GraphicalNeutrino’s runtime, strings are decrypted when needed using the decryption
algorithm shown in Figure 7. Each of the strings are decrypted using the key 0x2468a525676afca7.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
After removing API hooks and setting up persistence, GraphicalNeutrino prepares to communicate with
its C2 server. As part of this process, several strings are decrypted including a hardcoded user agent, a
Notion API key, and a database identifier.

A unique identifier is also calculated for the victim based on their username and computer name, as
shown in Figure 8. This function identifies the victim’s username and computer name, concatenates the
2 values together with an underscore, and then computes a “hash” value by adding together the ordinal
value of each character in the string.

Figure 8: Function for calculating a unique identifier based on the victim’s user and computer name (Source: Recorded Future)

The computed hash value is then prepended with “ItIEQ” and used in a Notion API database query filter
to determine if the victim has previously checked in to the C2 server. An example request is shown in
Figure 9.

At the time of analysis, the database had been deleted or was no longer accessible by the API key, as
indicated by the 404 response shown in Figure 9. However, by analyzing the sample, we were able to
identify the database schema used by the threat actors. The expected database contains columns for
“Name”, “Info”, and “Files”. The “Name” column contains the victim identifier (starting with ItIEQ); the
“Info” column contains an encrypted version of the victim’s user and computer name; and the “File”
column contains an encrypted shellcode payload. The “Info” column value is calculated by determining
the victim’s user name and computer name, XORing the characters with the victim’s ItIEQ identifier, and
then converting the resulting values into their hexadecimal representation.
If the original check-in request does not return any results, GraphicalNeutrino will then attempt to
create a new page for the victim in the database as shown in Figure 10.

GraphicalNeutrino then begins to update the victim’s row in the database with a new emoji in the
“Name” column every 60 seconds via an HTTP PATCH request as shown in Figure 11. The emoji starts
with the hex value 0xf09fa587 ( ) and is incremented by 0x1 for each request. This effectively
changes the emoji icon every 60 seconds and acts as a heartbeat for the victim.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Both the initial check-in request and the HTTP PATCH request to update the victim’s emoji receive the
victim’s full-page data returned in the response. For each response, the malware parses the JSON fields
to determine if the File column contains a value. An example response containing File column data is
provided in Figure 12.

Figure 12: An example response containing the File column and a URL for a payload to be executed (Source: Recorded Future)

If the file array is not empty then the malware will parse out the URL field and download the file. From
there the file is decrypted using a custom cipher. This decryption routine was reconstructed in Python
and can be seen in Figure 13.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Once the shellcode is decrypted, it is indirectly spawned in a new thread by abusing FLS callbacks to
obtain execution control as shown in Figure 14. Rather than specifying the shellcode’s address as the
start address for the thread, NTDLL’s rtlFlsAlloc is used instead. The rtlFlsAlloc function is used to
allocate fiber local storage and takes a callback function as an argument. GraphicalNeutrino creates the
thread in a suspended state and updates the thread’s context to have the RCX register (the first
argument to the function) point to the shellcode’s location in memory. Therefore, the shellcode will run
when the callback function is called. This technique was possibly used to evade antivirus (AV) and
sandbox detections that will emulate calls to FlsAlloc and return a failing condition or NULL.

Sample 2
We identified a second sample of GraphicalNeutrino (SHA256:
1cffaf3be725d1514c87c328ca578d5df1a86ea3b488e9586f9db89d992da5c4). This sample was
compiled on October 26, 2022, 2 days after the 7za.dll sample. It is nearly identical to the first sample;
however, a few details were changed:
● The Notion database ID was changed to 2888c2f2e72c4842b31aaa7b7dd76dbf, along with a
new API key
● The identifier prefix for victims was changed to “IetSZ”
● The wait time between C2 communications was adjusted to 2 minutes instead of 1 minute
● A different key was used to decrypt strings (0x6bbfba5babd291fc)
● The DLL’s export function was renamed to LoadData
For persistence, the sample expects itself to be named 140runtime.dll, and also to be located in the
same directory as vcruntime140.dll and photos_and_price.exe. Each of the files are copied to
%APPDATA_LOCAL%\photos and the registry key
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\7za update is then created with a
value of %APPDATA_LOCAL%\photos\photos_and_price.exe.
