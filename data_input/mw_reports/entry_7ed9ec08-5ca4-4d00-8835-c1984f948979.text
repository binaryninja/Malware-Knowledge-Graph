Cyberespionage Group Turla Deploys Backdoor Ahead of
G20 Task Force Summit
trendmicro.com/vinfo/vn/security/news/cyber-attacks/cyberespionage-group-turla-deploys-backdoor-ahead-of-g20summit

A cyberespionage group known as Turla is

reportedly targeting invitees, guests, and nation-state participants of the upcoming G20 task
force summit in Hamburg, Germany with a backdoor named KopiLuwak (detected by Trend
Micro as TROJ_KOPILUWAK.A, JS_KOPILUWAK.A, and JS_KOPILUWAK.B). The payload
is capable of exfiltrating data, as well as downloading and triggering additional malware and
executing arbitrary commands on the infected machine. Security researchers have since
notified CERT-Bund, Germany’s federal computer emergency response team.

Turla’s latest campaign is noted for possibly using watering hole and spear-phishing emails
that lure would-be victims with an email containing an invitation for a G20 Task Force summit
on digital economy. The event is real, slated in October, and security experts note that the
PDF, named Save the Date G20 Digital Economy Taskforce 23 24 October.pdf, attached in
the spear-phishing emails appear to be a legitimate file but ultimately a decoy. It also drops a
malicious JavaScript file that executes KopiLuwak in the infected system’s memory when
decrypted.

Turla, a Russian-speaking cyberespionage group, is known for using unique, stealthy tactics.
They made headlines in early June when their command and control (C&C) servers were
found hiding in the comment section of Britney Spears’ Instagram posts. The malware they
delivered posed as a security extension/plug-in for Firefox and distributed via a compromised
Swiss website. In September 2015, they were able to conceal their C&C servers by

exploiting and abusing poorly secured satellite-based internet services. In December 2014,
the cyberespionage group employed an open-source backdoor that targeted machines
running the Linux operating system (OS).

The attack chain of Turla’s latest campaign resembles one employed by other
cyberespionage groups Pawn Storm and ChessMaster. Real events and legitimate
documents were used as decoys to install backdoors on the machines of their targets of
interest. This enables them to move laterally within the compromised network as well as
steal confidential and mission-critical data.
These cyberespionage attacks highlight the need for organizations to be similarly proactive
in order to prevent intrusion or mitigate their effects. IT/system administrators and information
security professionals should adopt best practices against targeted attacks. Keeping the OS
and its programs updated should be intuitive—it helps prevent attackers from leveraging
security flaws as doorways into the systems. Consider virtual patching in the absence of
patches for certain vulnerabilities. Enforce the principle of least privilege. Secure your email
gateways and, more importantly, implement defense in depth—multilayered security
mechanisms—to protect the security, integrity, and availability of your organization’s
important assets.
