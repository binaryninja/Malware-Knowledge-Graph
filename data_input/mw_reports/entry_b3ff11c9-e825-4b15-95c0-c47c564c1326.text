Malware
EMOTET is making a comeback with increased activity from new variants that have the
potential to unleash different types of payloads in the affected system.

We first detected the banking malware EMOTET back in 2014, we looked into the banking
malware’s routines and behaviors and took note of its information stealing abilities via
network sniffing. In August, we found increased activity coming from new variants (Detected
by Trend Micro as TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJLA, TSPY_EMOTET.SMD3,
TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJKW, TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJKV) that have the potential to unleash
different types of payloads in the affected system.
A Resurgent Malware
While the motivation behind EMOTET—information theft—remain the same, the reason as to
why the malware resurfaced could be mainly attributed to two main possible reasons.
First, the authors behind this attack may be targeting new regions and industries.

While the earlier variants of EMOTET primarily targeted the banking sector, our Smart
Protection Network (SPN) data reveals that this time, the malware isn’t being picky about the
industries it chooses to attack. The affected companies come from different industries,
including manufacturing, food and beverage, and healthcare. Again, it is possible that due to
the nature of its distribution, EMOTET now has a wider scope.
The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada made up the bulk of the target regions, with
the US taking up 58% of all our detected infections, while Great Britain and Canada were at
12% and 8% respectively.

Second, these new variants use multiple ways to spread. Its primary propagation method
involves the use of a spam botnet, which results in its rapid distribution via email. EMOTET
can also spread via a network propagation module that brute forces its way into an account
domain using a dictionary attack. EMOTET’s use of compromised URLs as C&C servers
likely helped it spread as well.
The element of surprise could also have played a role in its effectiveness: due to its recent
inactivity, EMOTET’s resurgence managed to catch its targets off-guard, making the attacks,
new capabilities, and distribution more effective.
For a malware with email-spamming and lateral-movement capabilities, infecting business
systems and acquiring corporate e-mails translates to larger and more effective spam
targeting and a higher chance of gaining information.

Arrival and Installation
The new EMOTET variants initially arrive as spam claiming to be an invoice or payment
notification to trick its victims into believing that this is a legitimate email from a supplier.

Figure 3: Sample spam email
In the body of this email is a malicious URL that will download a document containing a
malicious macro when a user clicks on it. This macro will then execute a PowerShell
command line that is responsible for downloading EMOTET.
Here are some of the sample URLs we discovered:

hxxp://abbeykurtz[.]com/VZZQNZJIZD9113942
hxxp://aplacetogrowtherapy[.]com/CNNKIAPGEP3572621
hxxp://vanguardatlantic[.]com/Invoice-number-7121315833-issue/
hxxp://charly-bass[.]de/Copy-Invoice-0954/
Once downloaded, EMOTET drops and executes copies of itself into the following folders:
If EMOTET has no admin privileges, it will drop the copies into
%AppDataLocal%\Microsoft\Windows\{string 1}{string 2}.exe
If EMOTET contains admin privileges, it will instead drop the copies into System%\
{string 1}{string 2}.exe
The malware will attempt to ease its entry into the system by deleting the Zone Identifier
Alternate Data Stream (ADS), which is a string of information that describes the Internet
Explorer Trust Settings of the file's download source. This is one way for the system to find
out if a downloaded file is from a high-risk source, blocking the download if it is detected as
such.
EMOTET will then register itself as a system service and adds registry entries to ensure that
it is automatically executed at every system startup. The typical windows service acts as a
“controller” for most hardware-based applications, while others are used to control other
applications. The EMOTET malware, on the other hand, uses it for both Elevation of
Privilege, and as an autostart mechanism.
Routines
EMOTET will list the system’s currently running processes and then proceed to gather
information on both the system itself and the operating system used.
It will then connect to the Command & Control (C&C) servers to update to its latest version,
as well as to determine the type of payload that it will deliver. One of the possible payloads is
the persistent banking trojan known as DRIDEX, which attempts to harvest banking account
information via browser monitoring routines. Furthermore, the malware can also turn the
infected system into part of a botnet that sends spam emails intended to spread the malware
even further. This allows the trojan to spread quickly, as the more systems it can potentially
infect, the faster it will propagate. The malware is also capable of harvesting email
information and stealing username and password information found in installed browsers.
We discovered that in addition to the above payloads, the C&C server is responsible for
sending modules that will perform the following routines, which includes:
SPAMMING Module
Network Worm Module
Mail Password Viewer
Web Browser Password Viewer

From our recent samples of EMOTET malware, we have observed that it has become a
Loader Trojan that decrypts and loads any binary coming from its Command & Control (C&C)
server.
