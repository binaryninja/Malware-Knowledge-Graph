EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
• Our research attributes a decade of activity to a threat actor we call ModifiedElephant.
• ModifiedElephant is responsible for targeted attacks on human rights activists,
human rights defenders, academics, and lawyers across India with the objective of
planting incriminating digital evidence.
• ModifiedElephant has been operating since at least 2012, and has repeatedly
targeted specific individuals.
• ModifiedElephant operates through the use of commercially available remote access
trojans (RATs) and has potential ties to the commercial surveillance industry.
• The threat actor uses spearphishing with malicious documents to deliver malware,
such as NetWire, DarkComet, and simple keyloggers with infrastructure overlaps
that allow us to connect long periods of previously unattributed malicious activity.

BACKGROUND
In September 2021, SentinelLabs published research into the operations of a Turkish-nexus threat
actor we called EGoManiac, drawing attention to their practice of planting incriminating evidence
on the systems of journalists to justify arrests by the Turkish National Police. A threat actor willing
to frame and incarcerate vulnerable opponents is a critically underreported dimension of the cyber
threat landscape that brings up uncomfortable questions about the integrity of devices introduced
as evidence. Emerging details in an unrelated case caught our attention as a potentially similar
scenario worthy of more scrutiny.
Long-standing racial and political tensions in India were inflamed on January 1st, 2018 when
critics of the government clashed with pro-government supporters near Bhima Koregaon. The
event led to subsequent protests, resulting in more violence and at least one death.
In the following months, Maharashtra police linked the cause of the violence to the banned NaxaliteMaoist Communist party of India. On April 17th, 2018, police conducted raids and arrested a
number of individuals on terrorism-related charges. The arresting agencies identified incriminating
files on the computer systems of defendants, including plans for an alleged assassination attempt
against Prime Minister Modi.
Thanks to the public release of digital forensic investigation results by Arsenal Consulting and those
referenced below, we can glean rare insights into the integrity of the systems of some defendants
and grasp the origin of the incriminating files. It turns out that a compromise of defendant systems
led to the planting of files that were later used as evidence of terrorism and justification for the
defendants’ imprisonment. The intrusions in question were not isolated incidents.
Our research into these intrusions revealed a decade of persistent malicious activity targeting
specific groups and individuals that we now attribute to a previously unknown threat actor named
ModifiedElephant. This actor has operated for years, evading research attention and detection
due to their limited scope of operations, the mundane nature of their tools, and their regionallyspecific targeting. ModifiedElephant is still active at the time of writing.

TARGETS & OBJECTIVES
The objective of ModifiedElephant is long-term surveillance that at times concludes with the
delivery of ‘evidence’ –files that incriminate the target in specific crimes– prior to conveniently
coordinated arrests.
After careful review of the attackers’ campaigns over the last decade, we have identified hundreds
of groups and individuals targeted by ModifiedElephant phishing campaigns. Activists, human
rights defenders, journalists, academics, and law professionals in India are those most highly
targeted. Notable targets include individuals associated with the Bhima Koregaon case.

INFECTION ATTEMPTS
Throughout the last decade, ModifiedElephant operators sought to infect their targets via
spearphishing emails with malicious file attachments, with their techniques evolving over time.
Their primary delivery mechanism is malicious Microsoft Office document files weaponized to
deliver the malware of choice at the time. The specific payloads changed over the years and across
different targets. However, some notable trends remain.
• In mid-2013, the actor used phishing emails containing executable file attachments with
fake double extensions (filename.pdf.exe).
• After 2015, the actor moved on to less obvious files containing publicly available exploits,
such as .doc, .pps, .docx, .rar, and password protected .rar files. These attempts involved
legitimate lure documents in .pdf, .docx, and .mht formats to captivate the target’s
attention while also executing malware.
• In 2019 phishing campaigns, ModifiedElephant operators also took the approach of
providing links to files hosted externally for manual download and execution by the target.
• As first publicly noted by Amnesty in reference to a subset of this activity, the attacker also
made use of large .rar archives (up to 300MB), potentially in an attempt to bypass detection.
Observed lure documents repeatedly made use of CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-1761, CVE-20133906, CVE-2015-1641 exploits to drop and execute their malware of choice.
The spearphishing emails and lure attachments are titled and generally themed around topics
relevant to the target, such as activism news and groups, global and local events on climate
change, politics, and public service. A public deconstruction of two seperate 2014 phishing emails
was shared by Arsenal Consulting in early 2021.

Fig 1: Spearphishing email containing malicious attachment attributed to ModifiedElephant
ModifiedElephant continually made use of free email service providers, like Gmail and Yahoo,
to conduct their campaigns. The phishing emails take many approaches to gain the appearance
of legitimacy. This includes fake body content with a forwarding history containing long lists of
recipients, original email recipient lists with many seemingly fake accounts, or simply resending
their malware multiple times using new emails or lure documents. Notably, in specific attacks, the
actor would be particularly persistent and attempt to compromise the same individuals multiple
times in a single day.
By reviewing a timeline of attacker activity, we can observe clear trends as the attacker(s) rotate
infrastructure over the years.

For example, from early-2013 to mid-2016, a reasonably clear timeline
can be built with little overlap, indicating a potential evolution or
expansion of activities. Dates are based on first and last spearphishing
emails observed delivering samples that communicate with a given
domain. Notably, a separate Indian-nexus threat actor, SideWinder, is
placed alongside ModifiedElephant in this graph as they were observed
targeting the same individuals.

WEAPONS OF CHOICE
The malware most used by ModifiedElephant is unsophisticated and
downright mundane, and yet it has proven sufficient for their objectives–
obtaining remote access and unrestricted control of victim machines.
The primary malware families deployed were NetWire and DarkComet
remote access trojans (RATs). Both of these RATs are publicly available,
and have a long history of abuse by threat actors across the spectrum
of skill and capability.
One particular activity revolves around the file Ltr_1804_to_cc.pdf,
which contains details of an assassination plot against Prime Minister
Modi. A forensic report by Arsenal Consulting showed that this file, one
of the more incriminating pieces of evidence obtained by the police,
was one of many files delivered via a NetWire RAT remote session that
we associate with ModifiedElephant. Further analysis showed how
ModifiedElephant was performing nearly identical evidence creation
and organization across multiple unrelated victim systems within
roughly fifteen minutes of each other.

INCUBATOR KEYLOGGER
Known victims have also been targeted with keylogger payloads stretching
as far back as 2012 (0a3d635eb11e78e6397a32c99dc0fd5a). These
keyloggers, packed at delivery, are written in Visual Basic and are not
the least bit technically impressive. Moreover, they’re built in such a
brittle fashion that they no longer function.
The overall structure of the keylogger is fairly similar to code openly
shared on Italian hacking forums in 2012. The ModifiedElephant
variant creates a hidden window titled ‘cssrs incubator ’ along with
SetWindowsHookEx to monitor for keystrokes. It registers the mutex

“4oR_$$$tonelsu-mviiLempel-Ziv” and uses the VBScript to WMI connector to query for the victim
system’s MAC address and operating system. The malware eventually exfiltrates the logs under
the header “Logs from <COMPUTERNAME>” via email.

Fig 3: Log upload format string
In some ways, the Incubator keylogger is far more brittle than the code referenced above as it
relies on specific web content to function (that code is no longer available on the internet at the
time of writing). For example, the keylogger will use a GET request to an outdated ‘whatismyip.
com’ endpoint in order to get the victim system’s IP.

Fig 4: Outdated WhatIsMyIp endpoint used to check the victim’s IP
Similarly, in order to exfiltrate the logs, the keylogger pulls Microsoft schema templates to set up
an SMTP server and push out the content using a hardcoded (but obfuscated) email address. None
of the schema sites requested by the keylogger are available at the time of writing, rendering the
keylogger (in its 2012 form) unable to function.

keystrokes to attacker controlled accounts, including:

The keylogger samples also contain VBP and PDB paths, providing some potential context to their
originating development environments.

In some cases, the attacker conducted multiple unique phishing attempts with the same payloads
across one or more targets. However, ModifiedElephant generally conducts each infection attempt
with new malware samples.

ANDROID TROJAN
ModifiedElephant also sent multiple phishing emails containing both NetWire and Android malware
payloads at the same time. The Android malware is an unidentified commodity trojan delivered as
an APK file (0330921c85d582deb2b77a4dc53c78b3). While the Android trojan bears marks of
being designed for broader cybercrime, its delivery at the same time as ModifiedElephant Netwire
samples indicates that the same attacker was attempting to get full coverage of the target on both
endpoint and mobile.

attachments for Netwire and Android GM Bot variants.

attachments for Netwire and Android GM Bot variants.
The trojan enables the attackers to intercept and manage SMS and call data, wipe or unlock the
device, perform network requests, and remote administration. In a very basic form, the trojan
provides the attackers with an ideal low-cost mobile surveillance toolkit.

RELATIONS TO OTHER THREAT CLUSTERS
Our research into this threat actor reveals multiple interesting threads that highlight the complex
nature of targeted surveillance and tasking, where multiple actors swoop in with diverse mechanisms
to track the same group of individuals. These include private sector offensive actors (PSOAs) and
groups with possible commercial facades to coordinate their illicit activities.
Based on our analysis of ModifiedElephant, the group operates in an overcrowded target space and
may have relations with other regional threat actors. From our visibility, we can’t further disambiguate
the shape of that relationship–whether as part of an active umbrella organization, cooperation and
sharing of technical resources and targets across threat groups, or simply coincidental overlaps.
Some interesting overlaps are detailed below.
• Multiple individuals targeted by ModifiedElephant over the years have also been either targeted
or confirmed infected with mobile surveillance spyware. Amnesty International identified NSO
Group’s Pegasus being used in targeted attacks in 2019 against human rights defenders related
to the Bhima Koregaon case. Additionally, the Bhima Koregaon case defendant Rona Wilson’s
iPhone was targeted with Pegasus since 2017 based on a digital forensics analysis of an iTunes
backup found in the forensic disk images analyzed by Arsenal Consulting.
• Between February 2013 and January 2014 one target, Rona Wilson, received phishing
emails that can be attributed to the SideWinder threat actor. The relationship between
ModifiedElephant and SideWinder is unclear as only the timing and targets of their phishing
emails overlap within our dataset. This could suggest that the attackers are being provided with
similar tasking by a controlling entity, or that they work in concert somehow. SideWinder is a
threat actor targeting government, military, and business entities primarily throughout Asia.
• ModifiedElephant phishing email payloads (b822d8162dd540f29c0d8af28847246e) share
infrastructure overlaps (new-agency[.]us) with Operation Hangover. Operation Hangover includes
surveillance efforts against targets of interest to Indian national security, both foreign and
domestic, in addition to industrial espionage efforts against organizations around the world.
• Another curious finding is the inclusion of the string “Logs from Moosa’s” found in a keylogger sample
closely associated with ModifiedElephant activity in 2012 (c14e101c055c9cb549c75e90d0a99c0a).
The string could be a reference to Moosa Abd-Ali Ali, the Bahrain activist targeted around the
same time, with FinFisher spyware. Without greater information, we treat this as a low confidence
conjecture in need of greater research.

ATTRIBUTION
Attributing an attacker like ModifiedElephant is an interesting challenge. At this time, we possess
significant evidence of what the attacker has done over the past decade, a unique look into who
they’ve targeted, and a strong understanding of their technical objectives.
We observe that ModifiedElephant activity aligns sharply with Indian state interests and that there
is an observable correlation between ModifiedElephant attacks and the arrests of individuals in
controversial, politically-charged cases.

CONCLUSION
The Bhima Koregaon case has offered a revealing perspective into the world of a threat actor willing
to place significant time and resources into seeking the disruption of those with opposing views.
Our profile of ModifiedElephant has taken a look at a small subset of the total list of potential
targets, the attackers techniques, and a rare glimpse into their objectives. Many questions about
this threat actor and their operations remain; however, one thing is clear: Critics of authoritarian
governments around the world must carefully understand the technical capabilities of those who
would seek to silence them.

ABOUT SENTINELLABS
InfoSec works on a rapid iterative cycle where new discoveries occur daily and authoritative
sources are easily drowned in the noise of partial information. SentinelLabs is an open venue
for our threat researchers and vetted contributors to reliably share their latest findings with a
wider community of defenders. No sales pitches, no nonsense. We are hunters, reversers, exploit
developers, and tinkerers shedding light on the world of malware, exploits, APTs, and cybercrime
across all platforms. SentinelLabs embodies our commitment to sharing openly –providing tools,
context, and insights to strengthen our collective mission of a safer digital life for all.
