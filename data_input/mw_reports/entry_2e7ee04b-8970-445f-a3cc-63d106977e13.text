Attackers are distributing an information-stealing Trojan disguised as a PDF reader that
steals Facebook and Amazon session cookies as well as sensitive data from the Facebook
Ads Manager.
Over the weekend, MalwareHunterTeam found numerous sites distributing a fake PDF
editing program called 'PDFreader'.

The executables distributed from this site are signed by a digital certificate issued by
Sectigo to "Rakete Content Gmbh".

VirusTotal detects this Trojan as Socelars, but it also shares characteristics with other
Trojans, such as AdKoob and Stresspaint, that also attempt to extract and steal Facebook
data from various URLs.
According to Vitali Kremez, who analyzed this Trojan, there is not much code similarity
between this Trojan and the others, so it may be inspired rather than evolved from previous
infections.
"That tells it must be a newer (maybe inspired) variant or significantly improved one over
the previous generation. I assess this might be only the beginning of the evolution of this
type of malware targeting ad and social media providers," Kremez told
BleepingCOmputer.com

Targets Facebook Ads Manager
When launched, Kremez told BleepingComputer that the Trojan will first attempt to steal
Facebook sessions cookies from Chrome and Firefox by accessing the Cookies SQLite
database.
Once the cookie is retrieved, it will be used to connect a variety of Facebook URLs where
information is extracted.

The account_billing URL will be used to extract the user's account_id and access_token,
which will then be used in a Facebook Graph API call to steal data from the user's Ads
Manager settings.

Facebook Graph API call
The graph API call used is below:
https://graph.facebook.com/v4.0/act_{account_id}?
_reqName=adaccount&_reqSrc=AdsPaymentMethodsDataLoader&fields=%5B%22all_payment_metho

The stolen data, which consists of session cookies, access tokens, account ids, advertising
email address, associated pages, credit card info (number, expiration date), PayPal email,
ad balances, spending limits, etc, is then compiled and sent to the attacker's Command &
Control server.
With the USA election season looming and state-sponsored actors abusing Facebook ads
in the past, it is important for anyone running political campaigns to know that malware is
targeting Facebook's ad infrastructure.
"Also, I think in light of the upcoming elections and intensified FB campaigns running
political messages, this tool is almost like an espionage malware looking for possible
political narratives (and grabbing account information)," Kremez told
BleepingComputer.com.

To make matters worse, with the information stolen by the attackers, they could potentially
use these stolen Facebook cookies to access accounts and use them to create their own ad
campaigns.

Steals Amazon session cookies
While the main focus of this Trojan is to steal data from Facebook, the malware will also
attempt to steal session cookies for Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk.

Stealing Amazon session cookie
Unlike the Facebook routine, this cookie will simply be sent back to the attacker and will not
be used by the Trojan to extract any other information. Once again, if the attacker gains
access to a user's Amazon session cookie they will be able to log in as that user.

Distributed via adware bundles
As the sites promoting the 'PDFreader' program do not have active links that allow a user to
download the program, BleepingComputer investigated how this malware may be
distributed.
After following trail of other malware that communicated with one of the PDFreader
domains, we found that many of the requests to the PDFreader domains came from adware
bundles installing unwanted programs such as YeaDesktop or pretending to be copyrighted
software.
As this Trojan is silently executed and performs all its tasks in the background, users will not
be aware that anything was installed and will just see whatever adware or copyrighted
software was downloaded.

Likely Russia....since Mueller outed it spreading propaganda...is behind this.
Facebook users will once again be bombarded with pro-Trump Russian propaganda.
Facebook has refused to ban political ads like Twitter has done. That's assuming the
Senate will not vote to impeach Trump out of fear of losing their jobs. Trump is going
all out in rallies across the country with his lies about Ukraine...not Russia...interfering
in the last election. Voters should think about why Russia wanted Trump elected.

You cannot be serious LOL. Are you really this ridiculously clueless ?
Everything you said is completely bogus , it was democrats who colluded with Russia
and Ukraine helped the democrats in the 2016 election.
You got to stop watching fake news , see official list of fake news below.

"Politicians And Their Families Are Playing in The Corrupt Ukrainian Sandbox"
http://newswithviews.com/politicians-and-their-families-are-playing-in-the-corruptukrainian-sandbox/
"The impeachment investigation into President Donald J. Trump’s alleged quid pro
quo conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is beyond the theatre
of the absurd. The continued harassment and ongoing defamation against the 45th
president of the United States are acts of harassment, obstruction, and treason.
Democrats and the liberal mainstream fake news media have been on a perpetual
witch hunt to overthrow the duly elected POTUS and their credibility has reached new
lows. If the United States is to remain a republic, the Democrat Party and their liberal
propaganda media puppets must be stopped."
President Trump has the moral high ground and he has always been a fighter. He will
not sit idly by and allow a socialist-communist coup d’etat overthrow of his presidency
to occur. As President Trump has said, “They’re not really after me, they’re after you.
I’m just in their way.”

I thought this was a site for technical information, not political bickering. We certainly
need relevant FACTS (verifiable) to protect ourselves from this cyber-security threat,
but political finger-pointing and competing conspiracy theories will not help us here.
