Musical Chairs Playing Tetris

February 20, 2018: This blog has been amended since it was originally
published on February 15, 2018. This version removes the association with
the APT group responsible for the Night Dragon campaign that we had
incorrectly made. We thank the research team at Palo Alto Networks
(https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-research) for graciously
bringing this to our attention.

Introduction

ASERT has discovered new command-and-control infrastructure controlled by
the actors behind the Musical Chairs campaign. The actors are known for the
longevity of their C2 domains, reusing them long after they have been identi ed,
and for making use of a popular opened sourced RAT called Gh0st. Uniquely in
our observation, they have even embedded a fully-functional version of the game
Tetris that will launch only when a special condition is meet.

Key Findings

ASERT has discovered a new domain associated with the actors behind the
Musical Chairs campaign.
This long-standing actor is known for maintaining static command-andcontrol infrastructure such as domains for long periods of time, even when
they have been discovered and widely publicized in the community.
With moderate con dence, ASERT expects this domain to be used in new
intrusions.
Multiple (http://malware-unplugged.blogspot.com/2015/01/hunting-anddecrypting-communications.html) articles (https://www.sans.org/readingroom/whitepapers/detection/gh0st-dshell-decoding-undocumented-protocols37032) have been written about Gh0st over the years, including this one
discussing the Musical Chairs campaign
(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/musical-chairs-multi-

year-campaign-involving-new-variant-of-gh0st-malware/)‘s
use of this RAT. Using

identiﬁed a new sample and more

interestingly, a new domain that we have associated with the
corresponding actor.

The sample appears to be delivered via an email according to artifacts provided
by malware-tra c-analysis (http://www.malware-tra canalysis.net/2018/01/04/index.html), which is consistent with documented tactics
for this group (https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/musicalchairs-multi-year-campaign-involving-new-variant-of-gh0st-malware/).
Gh0st variants are proli c as they can be found in a popular open-source source
code repository – this blog provides the basis for our association with the actor.

Some other behavior of interest observed while reviewing this actor’s specimen
is they appear to be moving away from BAT and JS les as part of the infection
process[i] to using DLL side loading. This is just one sample though, so take this
for what it is. As part of the DLL side-loading, they make use of a signed
executable to load a DLL which in turn is used to launch the actual Gh0st DLL.
They are not the only malware authors who use this trick.
The observed functionality in this sample maps directly to public documentation
for Gh0st, so this blog will not rehash that.

Association No. 1
Starting with the known C2 servers for this group, we can check to see if the new
domain has any ties to them. Two of their C2s were registered back in 2013 and
the campaign has been around even longer than that per
Known Domains
yourbroiler[.]com
meitanjiaoyiwang[.]com
New Domain
etybh[.]com
Looking at DomainTools, we learn that all three share the same IP, 45.34.148.126,
and the same registrar, Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. LTD.

UNDER ATTACK? CALL (844) END.DDOS (HTTPS://WWW.ARBORNETWORKS.COM/OFFICE-CONTACTINFORMATION)

(https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wpcontent/uploads/2018/02/musical_chairs_CNCs.png)
The newest domain, etybh[.]com, was registered in December of 2017. Looking
at PassiveTotal, all three domains appeared to have switched from
98.126.223.218 to 45.34.148.146 sometime in the middle of January 2018. This is
our rst clue that they are related.

Association No. 2
This one comes from looking at behavior when the le is attached to a debugger.
First, let us back up a step. Observing behaviors of our suspected Musical Chairs
Gh0st sample via a sandbox, we see that it creates a folder called “Win32Tetris”.
Let’s see if there are any other Gh0st samples that do this as well. Taking a look
through ASERT’s malware corpus we nd this sample,
11fe12bbb479b4562c1f21a74e09b233ed41c41b7c4c0cad73692 4672fb86a,
which also creates that folder. Using clues left by another researcher[ii], we can
con rm that this more recent sample is from the Musical Chairs group due to the
C2 and some other characteristics we’ll go over. The most promising correlation
is that this sample’s C2 is www.yourbroiler[.]com which is a known C2 for this
actor. Next, we nd similarities from a di erent dropped le called
C:\microsoft\lib\ki\vv.js whose content reads as such:

(https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wpcontent/uploads/2018/02/vv_js_snippet.png)
The content is similar to samples identi ed back in 2015[iii], which also used
rundll32 to call a mystart method. And, nally, this sample makes use of the
same mutex tied to this actor’s Gh0st variant: dafewewrw.
To summarize the pivot sample

Value

Now that we have con rmed that this sample appears to be a Musical Chairs
actor Gh0st variant, let’s work the pivot (going to refer to this sample as the
“pivot” sample).
The pivot sample, when attached to a debugger, will launch what appears to be a
fully functional Tetris game (very friendly of them to provide us reverse engineers
with a short break):

new domain, etybh[.]com) also exhibits this

same behavior when attached to the debugger. To play the game make sure to
not hide the PEB. For what it is worth, after checking out one of the prior
samples from 2015[iv], it exhibited similar behavior; just not a Tetris game.

Association No. 3
The nal observation is the fact that the payload dropped on the le system as
RasTls.dat is in fact an obfuscated DLL le. When looking at the DLL properties
the mystart function is exported. Again, mystart is the exported DLL function
which the samples back in 2015 called.

Conclusion
While it should not surprise us when a long-standing actor switches things up,
this speci c actor is known for not really changing much. The use of a di erent
Gh0st variant in addition to the new domain may be indicative of additional
changes coming or the actor may be just keeping up with the times. Given
previously observed behavior, it is likely that this indicator will be used in the
campaign for the foreseeable future and ASERT is making it available to enable
visibility for the broader security research community.
