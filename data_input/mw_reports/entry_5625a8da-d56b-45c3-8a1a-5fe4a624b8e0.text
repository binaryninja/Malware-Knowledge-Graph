Potential for China Cyber Response to Heightened U.S.–
China Tensions
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-275a

Summary
This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
(ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat
actor techniques.
Note: on October 20, 2020, the National Security Agency (NSA) released a cybersecurity
advisory providing information on publicly known vulnerabilities exploited by Chinese statesponsored cyber actors to target computer networks holding sensitive intellectual property,
economic, political, and military information. This Alert has been updated to include
information on vulnerabilities exploited by Chinese state-sponsored actors (see Table 4).
In light of heightened tensions between the United States and China, the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is providing specific Chinese government and affiliated
cyber threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and recommended mitigations
to the cybersecurity community to assist in the protection of our Nation’s critical
infrastructure. In addition to the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this
Alert, CISA recommends organizations take the following actions.
1. Adopt a state of heightened awareness. Minimize gaps in personnel availability,
consistently consume relevant threat intelligence, and update emergency call trees.
2. Increase organizational vigilance. Ensure security personnel monitor key internal
security capabilities and can identify anomalous behavior. Flag any known Chinese
indicators of compromise (IOCs) and TTPs for immediate response.
3. Confirm reporting processes. Ensure personnel know how and when to report an
incident. The well-being of an organization’s workforce and cyber infrastructure
depends on awareness of threat activity. Consider reporting incidents to CISA to help
serve as part of CISA’s early warning system (see the Contact Information section
below).
4. Exercise organizational incident response plans. Ensure personnel are familiar with
the key steps they need to take during an incident. Do they have the accesses they
need? Do they know the processes? Are various data sources logging as expected?
Ensure personnel are positioned to act in a calm and unified manner.

Technical Details
China Cyber Threat Profile

1/22

China has a history of using national military and economic resources to leverage offensive
cyber tactics in pursuing its national interests. The “Made in China 2025” 10-year plan
outlines China’s top-level policy priorities.[1],[2] China may seek to target the following
industries deemed critical to U.S. national and economic interests: new energy vehicles, next
generation information technology (IT), biotechnology, new materials, aerospace, maritime
engineering and high-tech ships, railway, robotics, power equipment, and agricultural
machinery.[3] China has exercised its increasingly sophisticated capabilities to illegitimately
obtain U.S. intellectual property (IP), suppress both social and political perspectives deemed
dangerous to China, and harm regional and international opponents.
The U.S. Intelligence Community and various private sector threat intelligence organizations
have identified the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Ministry of State Security
(MSS) as driving forces behind Chinese state-sponsored cyberattacks–either through
contractors in the Chinese private sector or by the PLA and MSS entities themselves. China
continues to engage in espionage-related activities that include theft of sensitive information
such as innovation capital, IP, and personally identifiable information (PII). China has
demonstrated a willingness to push the boundaries of their activities to secure information
critical to advancing their economic prowess and competitive advantage.
Chinese Cyber Activity
According to open-source reporting, offensive cyber operations attributed to the Chinese
government targeted, and continue to target, a variety of industries and organizations in the
United States, including healthcare, financial services, defense industrial base, energy,
government facilities, chemical, critical manufacturing (including automotive and aerospace),
communications, IT, international trade, education, videogaming, faith-based organizations,
and law firms.
Additionally, numerous Department of Justice (DOJ) indictments over several years provide
evidence to suggest Chinese threat actors continuously seek to illegally obtain and exfiltrate
U.S. IP. Their targets also include western companies with operations inside China.
Public reporting that associates Chinese actors with a range of high-profile attacks and
offensive cyber activity includes:
February 2013 – Cyber Threat Intelligence Researchers Link Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT) 1 to China: a comprehensive report publicly exposed APT1 as part of
China’s military cyber operations and a multi-year effort that exfiltrated IP from roughly
141 companies spanning 20 major industries.[4] APT1 established access to the
victims’ networks and methodically exfiltrated IP across a large range of industries
identified in China’s 12th 5-Year Plan. A year later, the DOJ indicted Chinese cyber
threat actors assigned to PLA Unit 61398 for the first time (also highlighted in the
report).[5]

2/22

April 2017 – Chinese APTs Targeting IP in 12 Countries: CISA announced Chinese
state-backed APTs carried out a multi-year campaign of cyber-enabled IP theft that
targeted global technology service providers and their customers. The threat actors
leveraged stolen administrative credentials (local and domain) and placed
sophisticated malware on critical systems in an effort to steal the IP and sensitive data
of companies located in at least 12 countries.[6]
December 2018 – Chinese Cyber Threat Actors Indicted for Compromising
Managed Service Providers (MSPs): DOJ indicted two Chinese cyber threat actors
believed to be associated with APT10, who targeted MSPs and their large customer
base through phishing and spearphishing campaigns aimed at exfiltrating sensitive
business data and, possibly, PII.[7] CISA also briefed stakeholders on Chinese APT
groups who targeted MSPs and their customers to steal data and further operationalize
commercial and economic espionage.[8]
February 2020 – China’s Military Indicted for 2017 Equifax Hack: DOJ indicted
members of China’s PLA for stealing large amounts of PII and IP. The Chinese cyber
threat actors exploited a vulnerability in the company’s dispute resolution website to
enter the network, conduct reconnaissance, upload malware, and steal credentials to
extract the targeted data. The breach impacted roughly half of all American citizens
and stole Equifax’s trade secrets.[9]
May 2020 – China Targets COVID-19 Research Organizations: the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) and CISA reported the targeting and compromise of U.S.
organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by cyber actors affiliated with
China.[10] Large-scale password spraying campaigns were a commonly observed
tactic in illicitly obtaining IP related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks
and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research.[11],[12]
Common TTPs of Publicly Known Chinese Threat Actors
The section below provides common, publicly known, TTPs employed by Chinese threat
actors, which map to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Where possible, the tables include
actions for detection and mitigation. This section is not exhaustive and does not detail all
TTPs or detection and mitigation actions.
PRE-ATT&CK TTPs
Chinese threat actors commonly use the techniques listed in table 1 to achieve
reconnaissance (Technical Information Gathering [TA0015]), staging (Stage Capabilities
[TA0026]), and testing (Test Capabilities [TA0025]) before executing an attack. PRE-ATT&CK
techniques can be difficult to detect and mitigate, however, defenders should be aware of the
use of these techniques.

Additional APT Activity
The TTPs listed above have been repeatedly used across the spectrum of Chinese threat
actors. The mitigations referenced in this alert can help reduce vulnerability to these TTPs;
however, defenders should also maintain heightened awareness of threats actors that are
more innovative in their approach, making it difficult to detect and respond to compromise.
Publicly reported examples[13] include:
APT3 (known as UPS Team) is known for deploying zero-day attacks that target
Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Adobe Flash Player. The group’s custom implants and
changing Command and Control (C2) infrastructure make them difficult to track. APT3
exploits use Rivest Cypher 4 (RC4) encryption to communicate and bypass address
space layout randomization (ASLR)/Data Execution Prevention (DEP) by using Return
Oriented Programming (ROP) chains.[14]
APT10 (known as MenuPass Group) has established accessed to victim networks
through compromised service providers, making it difficult for network defenders to
identify the malicious traffic.
APT19 (known as Codoso and Deep Panda) is known for developing custom Rich Text
Format (RTF) and macro-enabled Microsoft Office documents for both implants and
payloads. The group has backdoored software, such as software serial generators, and
has an elite use of PowerShell for C2 over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/Hyper
Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).[15]
APT40 (known as Leviathan) has targeted external infrastructure with success,
including internet-facing routers and virtual private networks.
APT41 (known as Double Dragon) has exploited vulnerabilities in Citrix
NetScaler/ADC, Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central to
compromise victims.[16]

Mitigations
Recommended Actions
The following list provides actionable technical recommendations for IT security
professionals to reduce their organization’s overall vulnerability. These recommendations are
not exhaustive; rather they focus on the actions that will greatly reduce stakeholders’ attack
surface.

9/22

1. Patch systems and equipment promptly and diligently. Establishing and
consistently maintaining a thorough patching cycle continues to be the best defense
against adversary TTPs. Focus on patching critical and high vulnerabilities that allow
for remote code execution or denial-of-service on externally-facing (i.e., internet)
equipment. Certain vulnerabilities—including CVE-2012-0158 in Microsoft products
[17], CVE-2019-19781 in Citrix devices [18], and CVE-2020-5902 in BIG-IP Traffic
Management User Interface [19]—have presented APTs with prime targets to gain
initial access. Chinese APTs often use existing exploit code to target routinely exploited
vulnerabilities [20], which present an opportunistic attack that requires limited
resources. See table 3 for patch information on CVEs that have been routinely
exploited by Chinese APTs. See table 4 for patch information on vulnerabilities that the
National Security Agency (NSA) has stated are actively used by Chinese statesponsored cyber actors.

(CVE-2020-8515)

20/22

1. Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Audit configuration
management programs to ensure they can track and mitigate emerging threats. Review
system configurations for misconfigurations and security weaknesses. Implementing a
robust configuration and patch management program hinders sophisticated APT
operations by limiting the effectiveness of opportunistic attacks.
2. Disable unnecessary ports, protocols, and services. Review network security
device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary ports and protocols.
Monitor common ports and protocols for C2 activity. Turn off or disable any
unnecessary services or functionality within devices (e.g., universal plug and play
[UPnP], PowerShell).
3. Enhance monitoring of network and email traffic. Review network signatures and
indicators for focused operations activities, monitor for new phishing themes, and
adjust email rules accordingly. Follow best practices of restricting attachments via
email. Ensure that log information is aggregated and correlated to enable maximum
detection capabilities, with a focus on monitoring for account misuse.
4. Use protection capabilities to stop malicious activity. Implement antivirus software
and other endpoint protection capabilities to automatically detect and prevent malicious
files from executing. Use network intrusion detection and prevention systems to identify
and prevent commonly employed adversarial malware and limit nefarious data
transfers.
