AvosLocker is one of the newer ransomware families that came to fill the void left by REvil. While not as prominent or active as LockBit or
Conti, it is slowly making a name for itself, with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) releasing an advisory on this threat. According to
the report, AvosLocker has been targeting critical infrastructure in different sectors of the US, with attacks also observed in other countries like
Canada, UK, and Spain. Although detections are low, its clever use of familiar tactics makes it a ransomware variant worth monitoring today.

What do organizations need to know about AvosLocker?

AvosLocker is another variant that runs on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. It was first spotted in July 2021 and has since come up
with several variants released over time. The following are the key characteristics of AvosLocker:
It uses the remote administration tool AnyDesk. One of the notable characteristics of AvosLocker campaigns is its use of AnyDesk, a
remote administration tool (RAT) to connect to victim machines. Using this tool, the operator can manually operate and infect the
machine.
It runs on safe mode. Another key element of AvosLocker is running itself on safe mode as part of its evasion tactics. The attacker
restarts the machine, disables certain drivers, and runs on safe mode, thus avoiding certain security measures that are unable to run in
this mode. Operators also set up certain drivers to make sure that AnyDesk would run even in safe mode. It is important to note that this
was a tactic previously employed by the now defunct REvil.
Operators auction stolen data. AvosLocker again takes a leaf from REvil’s page by auctioning stolen data on its site, on top of its
double extortion scheme. This could be the group’s way of further monetizing a single successful attack or salvaging a failed one.
As mentioned, AvosLocker operators have also released multiple versions of this ransomware. The tactic of running itself on safe mode was
seen in the second version of AvosLocker. Following the trend of targeting Linux machines, AvosLocker also released a Linux variant as
advertised by the group on October 2021. This variant is capable of attacking ESXi virtual machines (VMs), which makes it a variant to watch
out for.
Operating as an RaaS, the actors behind AvosLocker conduct reconnaissance before each campaign. Actors choose their targets based on
their ability to pay the demanded ransom and tailor their attacks accordingly.
In the next sections, we look at which regions and industries the group has targeted most often, based on our detections and information from
their leak site.

Top affected industries and countries

We also ventured into AvosLocker’s leak site, which offered a different perspective on its targets. From December 1, 2021 to February 28,
2022 we found 15 listed entities. The organizations listed in the site were successfully attacked and have not, in that period, paid the
demanded ransom.
By grouping the list according to regions, we found that AvosLocker focused its efforts on targets from North America.

Figure 4. Regional distribution of AvosLocker victims according to the group’s leak site (December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)
More than half of the 15 entities we found in the leak site were small enterprises. With respect to the targets’ specific industries, we saw no
trend emerging, as no one industry stood out from the others. This can be seen in Figure 6, where no single industry stood out from the rest.

Figure 5. Sector distribution of AvosLocker victims according to the group’s leak site (December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)
We do note, however, that AvosLocker has showed relatively less activity compared to other more prominent ransomware families in terms of
our detections and observations from its leak site. Because of the limited sample size, further monitoring might be necessary to identify trends.

Infection chain and techniques
The AvosLocker infection chain, which operates on the RaaS model, can vary depending on the target. The following infection chain shows a
variety of tactics and tools employed by this RaaS.

Initial Access
AvosLocker uses Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus and its exploit for initial access and to download of web shell and AnyDesk.
It has been reported to make use of compromised accounts to access its victims via RDP or virtual private network (VPN).

Defense Evasion, Discovery, and Credential Access
It uses Avast Anti-Rootkit Driver and a PowerShell script to disable certain antivirus processes.
It uses a BAT script to disable antivirus services that can run on Windows Safe Mode.
It uses Mimikatz and XenArmor Password Recovery Pro Tool to get credentials.
It also uses Nmap, NetScan, and native Windows commands (such as ipconfig, nslookup, and others) to perform discovery on the target
network.
It avoids writing the ransomware payload in target systems.

Lateral Movement and Command and Control
AvosLocker installs AnyDesk to gain control of the targeted systems.
It uses PDQ Deploy to push out and execute the Windows batch script on the targeted systems.

Impact
It then executes the ransomware payload (AvosLocker) to perform its encryption routine once all other routines are done.
It now has both Windows and Linux version of this ransomware payload. The Linux version is also known to terminate ESXi virtual
machines.
In its latest attacks, the Windows version was executed after restarting in safe mode to inhibit security software from detecting the
ransomware variant.

5/11

In order to execute on safe mode, it adds a RunOnce registry entry under autostart. Further investigation revealed multiple ways
AvosLocker can be executed via the RunOnce registry, which are the following:
1. Direct execution of the ransomware payload
2. Execute a PowerShell script that will download and execute the ransomware payload
3. Execute a PowerShell script that will decode and execute the ransomware payload from a disguised .jpg file.
It drops a ransom note similar to the one in Figure 7.

Recommendations
9/11

While AvosLocker is not yet as prominent as other ransomware families like LockBit, Conti, and Clop, it seems to follow in the footsteps of
these more established players. It also reuses tactics that worked for infamous ransomware families, namely REvil. This should be enough
reason for organizations to keep an eye on this ransomware family as well as to stay abreast with the latest trends and tactics employed by
threat actors today.
To help defend systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that can allocate resources systematically for
establishing solid defenses against ransomware.
Here are some best practices that can be included in these frameworks:

Audit and inventory
Take an inventory of assets and data.
Identify authorized and unauthorized devices and software.
Make an audit of event and incident logs.

Configure and monitor
Manage hardware and software configurations.
Grant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role.
Monitor network ports, protocols, and services.
Activate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers.
Establish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications.

Patch and update
Conduct regular vulnerability assessments.
Perform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications.
Update software and applications to their latest versions.

Protect and recover
Implement data protection, back up, and recovery measures.
Enable multifactor authentication (MFA).

Secure and defend
Employ sandbox analysis to block malicious emails.
Deploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network.
Detect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system.
Use advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning.

Train and test
Regularly train and assess employees on security skills.
Conduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.
A multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network). Security
solutions that can detect malicious components and suspicious behavior can also help protect enterprises.
