DDoS IRC Bot Malware (GoLang) Being Distributed via
Webhards

January 19, 2022

While monitoring the distribution source of malware in Korea, the ASEC analysis team has
discovered that DDoS IRC Bot strains disguised as adult games are being installed via
webhards. Webhards are platforms commonly used for the distribution of malware in Korea,
where njRAT and UDP Rat were distributed in the past.
UDP RAT Malware Being Distributed via Webhards
The cases that are recently being discovered are similar to the case discussed in the post
above, and it appears that the same attacker is continuing to distribute the malware. For
starters, the malware is being distributed under the guise of adult games. Additionally, the
DDoS malware was installed via downloader and UDP Rat was used.
One difference is that the previous downloader malware was developed using C#, but now
GoLang is used instead. The publicly released open-source Simple-IRC-Botnet (DDoS IRC
Bot malware developed with GoLang) was also used along with UDP Rat.

The GoLang is used by various attackers and its usage is increasing recently due to various
strengths it has: its low development difficulties and its cross-platform support. Following
such a trend, cases that use GoLang are increasing in Korat malware strains that target
Korean users.
As shown in the figure below, malware disguised as an adult game is uploaded to the
webhard.

While it is uncertain whether the person who uploaded this game is the attacker, similar
posts are distributing the same malware using compressed files. Note that the games differ
but the malware inside the compressed files is the same as what will be discussed below.

The adult games used for attacks contain the following path name. This means that they
were distributed through the compressed files with the following names.
– [19 Korean version] Naughty Mage’s EXXXXX Life
– [19 Korean version] The Reason She Became a Slave
– [19 Korean version] Refraining of Heavenly Walk
– [19 Korean version] Exchange Diary of Violation

Upon decompressing the downloaded zip file, the following files appear. Normally, users
would run the “Game_Open.exe” file shown below to play the game.

But “Game_Open.exe” is not a launcher that runs the game. It is an executable that runs the
additional malware. To be more precise, it changes the “PN” file existing in the same path as
“scall.dll” and runs it. Then it copies the original game executable “index” to “Game.exe” to
run it. As such, users would assume that the game is being run normally.

Figure 5. Actual game program run by malware
Once the process above is complete, the “Game_Open.exe” file becomes hidden. After
hidden, users would run “Game.exe” which is a copy of game program launcher. Note that
“PN” file that was changed to “scall.exe” and executed is malware. It first moves “srt” file
existing in the same path to C:\Program Files\EdmGen.exe.

It then registers “EdmGen.exe” to the task scheduler using the following command to have it
run periodically.
“C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe” /c SCHTASKS /CREATE /SC ONSTART /NP /TN
“Windows Google” /TR “C:\Program Files\EdmGen.exe”
“EdmGen.exe” (“srt” file) that is executed by the process shown above runs the normal
program vbc.exe and injects malware into the program. The malware that is injected to
vbc.exe and executed is also a downloader type discussed in the previous ASEC blog post.
One difference is that it was developed with GoLang instead of C#.
The malware can periodically access the C&C server as shown below to obtain the URL of
malware that will be downloaded to install additional malware.

[malware name]
Previously, the type of additionally installed malware was UDP Rat DDoS. Yet for this case,
there was also Simple-IRC-Botnet developed with GoLang.
It is also a type of DDoS Bot malware, but it uses IRC protocols to communicate with the
C&C server. Unlike UDP Rat that only supported UDP Flooding attacks, it can also support
attacks such as Slowris, Goldeneye, and Hulk DDoS.

IRC Bot malware
Golang DDoS IRC Bot connects to a particular IRC server when it is run and enters the
attacker’s channel. It can perform DDoS attacks on a target if the attacker sends commands
from the channel.

As shown in the examples above, the malware is being distributed actively via file sharing
websites such as Korean webhards. As such, caution is advised when approaching
executables downloaded from a file-sharing website. It is recommend for the users to
download products from the official websites of developers.
