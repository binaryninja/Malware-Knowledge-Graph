Cybercrime Organization Victimized Millions in all 50 States and
Worldwide in One of the Largest Cyberfraud Enterprises Ever
Prosecuted by the Department of Justice
An author of malicious computer software and a member of the Infraud Organization pleaded
guilty today to RICO conspiracy, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C.
Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.
Valerian Chiochiu, aka “Onassis,” “Flagler,” “Socrate,” and “Eclessiastes,” 30, pleaded guilty
before U.S. District Court Judge James C. Mahan in the District of Nevada. Chiochiu is a
national of the Republic of Moldova, but resided in the United States during the period of the
conspiracy. His plea came just over a month after the co-founder and administrator of
Infraud, Sergey Medvedev of Russia, separately pleaded guilty on June 26. Sentencing for
Chiochiu has been scheduled for Dec. 11.

Infraud was an Internet-based cybercriminal enterprise engaged in the large-scale
acquisition, sale, and dissemination of stolen identities, compromised debit and credit cards,
personally identifiable information, financial and banking information, computer malware, and
other contraband.
“Over the course of seven years, Infraud and its alleged conspirators created a sophisticated
cybercriminal racketeering scheme that victimized individuals, merchants, and financial
institutions to the tune of over half a billion dollars in losses,” said Acting Assistant Attorney
General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The Justice
Department is committed to unmasking cyber criminals and their criminal organizations that
use the internet for fraudulent schemes.”
“HSI and our partners are at the forefront of combating financial crimes and illicit activities
spread on the Internet,” said Special Agent in Charge Francisco Burrola for the U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Las Vegas
Office. “While criminal operators may continue to grow the reach of their criminal activity,
ultimately they do not escape the reach of law enforcement. We continue to investigate,
disrupt, and dismantle hidden illegal networks that pose a threat in cyberspace.”
According to the indictment, the Infraud Organization was created in October 2010 by
Medvedev and Svyatoslav Bondarenko, aka “Obnon,” “Rector,” and “Helkern,” 34, of
Ukraine, to promote and grow interest in the Infraud Organization as the premier destination
for “carding” —purchasing retail items with counterfeit or stolen credit card information — on
the Internet. Under the slogan, “In Fraud We Trust,” the organization directed traffic and
potential purchasers to the automated vending sites of its members, which served as online
conduits to traffic in stolen means of identification, stolen financial and banking information,
malware, and other illicit goods. It also provided an escrow service to facilitate illicit digital
currency transactions among its members and employed screening protocols that purported
to ensure only high quality vendors of stolen cards, personally identifiable information, and
other contraband were permitted to advertise to members. In March 2017, there were
10,901 registered members of the Infraud Organization.
Bondarenko currently remains a fugitive.
According to the indictment, Chiochiu provided guidance to other Infraud members on the
development, deployment, and use of malware as a means of harvesting stolen data. As
part of his plea agreement, Chiochiu admitted to authoring a strain of malware known to the
computer security community as “FastPOS”.
During the course of its seven-year history, the Infraud Organization inflicted approximately
$2.2 billion in intended losses, and more than $568 million in actual losses, on a wide swath
of financial institutions, merchants, and private individuals, and would have continued to do
so for the foreseeable future if left unchecked.

The investigation was conducted by the Las Vegas Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the Henderson, Nevada Police
Department. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California also provided
assistance with Chiochiu’s case. Deputy Chief Kelly Pearson and Trial Attorneys Chad W.
McHenry and Alexander Gottfried of the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Gang
Section are prosecuting the case.
