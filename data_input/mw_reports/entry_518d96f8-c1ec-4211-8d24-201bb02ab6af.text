Recent attacks involving the destructive malware Shamoon (W32.Disttrack.B) were
launched by attackers conducting a much wider campaign in the Middle East. While the
attackers have compromised multiple targets in the region, only selected targets in Saudi
Arabia were infected with Shamoon.
On February 15, publications from IBM (The Full Shamoon) and Palo Alto (Magic Hound)
separately discussed a persistent attack campaign operating primarily in the Middle East
with links to Shamoon. This campaign was conducted by a group we identify as
Timberworm. The group appears to have facilitated the third wave of destructive attacks
involving Shamoon in January 2017. Timberworm operates in the Middle East and beyond.
Only specific organizations affiliated with Saudi Arabia appear to have been earmarked for
destructive wiping attacks.
During the January attacks, Symantec discovered a high correlation between Timberworm
and the presence of Shamoon in a number of organizations in Saudi Arabia. Timberworm
appears to have gained access to these organizations’ networks weeks and, in some
cases, months before the Shamoon attacks occurred. Once on the network, the attackers'
primary goal appeared to be similar to Greenbug (an actor previously discussed in relation
to the November 17 wave of attacks): detailed network reconnaissance, credential
harvesting, and persistent remote access.
When Timberworm had sufficient access to a number of high value organizations, Shamoon
was then preconfigured with a wipe date and the necessary credentials to maximize the
overall impact during a coordinated attack. This procedure is consistent with what was
observed during Greenbug operations prior to the November 17 attacks, which may indicate
that multiple groups are cooperating to facilitate these destructive attacks, possibly at the
direction of a single entity.

Stage 1: Timberworm recon

1/4

Timberworm’s carefully planned operation saw the attackers send spear phishing emails to
individuals at targeted organizations. In some cases, the emails contained Microsoft Word
or Excel files as attachments. In others, the emails contained malicious links, which if
clicked, downloaded similar Word or Excel files.

Computer network exploitation
Opening the document invoked PowerShell from a malicious macro, which provided the
attackers with remote access to the compromised computer. Some basic reconnaissance
was then performed using existing system tools to determine if the target was of interest.
Once Timberworm was satisfied, it then deployed custom malware, hacktools, and software
traditionally used in system/network administration. Some of the tools deployed during
these attacks included:
PsExec, a tool for executing processes on other systems from Microsoft Sysinternals
PAExec, a free re-implementation of PsExec from Poweradmin
Netscan, a multipurpose IPv4/IPv6 network scanner
Samdump, a hacking tool that dumps Windows password hashes
Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz), a hacking tool to harvest credentials
TightVNC, an open-source remote desktop access application
Plink, a command line network connection tool supporting encrypted communications
Rar, archiving utility for compressing files before ex-filtration.
During this phase, once the attacker appeared to have achieved the desired level of
network access, Plink was executed to provide an additional avenue of remote access (Fex
reverse RDP over SSH connections). This pattern of activity is also consistent with what
was observed during Greenbug operations in 2016, before the eventual deployment of
Shamoon.

Stage 2: Shamoon destruction
At this point the attackers configured the Shamoon payloads per organization and then
coordinated the attacks on a pre-determined date. In the January 23 attacks Symantec
observed consistent usage of PAExec across numerous organizations to initially deploy
W32.Disttrack.B. After it was deployed, it would self-propagate and wipe accessible
computers across the network.

Multiple teams cooperating?
Timberworm appears to be a much larger operation, infiltrating a much broader range of
organizations beyond those affected by the recent Shamoon attacks. Similarly, Greenbug
targeted a range of organizations in the Middle East beyond those affected by Shamoon,

including companies in the aviation, energy, government, investment, and education
sectors. While both groups leveraged two distinct toolsets, their targets, tactics, and
procedures align very well and in close proximity to the coordinated wiping events.

“Living off the land”
The Shamoon attacks illustrate how a growing number of targeted attack groups are relying
on common-off-the-shelf tools to compromise targets. The Shamoon attackers managed to
get access to targets’ networks using socially engineered spear-phishing emails and
abusing Office macros and PowerShell to gain initial footholds. In particular, the use of
PowerShell has been a popular tactic of late. Recent Symantec research found a total of
111 malware families that use the PowerShell command line. More than 95 percent of the
PowerShell scripts analyzed through the BlueCoat Malware Analysis sandbox were found
to be malicious.
The appeal of “living off the land” is obvious. Attackers believe malicious activity will be
more difficult to detect if legitimate tools are involved and malware use is kept to a
minimum. The use of legitimate tools may also serve to thwart attribution to specific actors.
