Executive Summary
On Oct. 28, 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
released a joint cybersecurity alert regarding an increased and imminent cybersecurity threat
to the U.S. healthcare system.
Threat operators have displayed a heightened interest in targeting the healthcare and the
public health sector, potentially disrupting healthcare services and operations. Activities
observed include the use of Trickbot malware, a well-known information stealer that can lead
to the installation of other malicious files, including Ryuk ransomware.
1/19

This alert comes shortly after Universal Health Services (UHS) reported a Ryuk ransomware
attack that disrupted all U.S. UHS sites for weeks. Other U.S.-based hospitals have reported
similar ransomware attacks, including a hospital in Oregon and one in New York. Similarly, a
health tech organization in Philadelphia was also the target of a ransomware attack.
Palo Alto Networks security subscriptions for the Next-Generation Firewall with WildFire
detects activity associated with Trickbot and Ryuk. The DNS Security subscription is able to
detect the Anchor_DNS DNS tunneling described in this blog. Cortex XDR also contains an
Anti-Ransomware Protection module and an Anti-Malware Protection module, which target
encryption-based activities associated with ransomware and other malicious file behaviors.
Additionally, AutoFocus customers can review activity related to this threat activity with the
following tags: Ryuk, Trickbot and BazaLoader.

Malware Overview
Trickbot is modular malware that provides backdoor access, enabling operators to distribute
additional malware onto victim systems, and includes other capabilities such as worm
functionality and system enumeration. One of the newest modules, Anchor_DNS, is used for
DNS tunneling during command and control (C2) actions.
The Anchor_DNS module uses PowerShell to run scripts and makes multiple DNS requests
including connectivity checks to benign legitimate domains. Malware often does this to
confirm an active network connection that will allow the threat operator to communicate with
that system during C2 activities. The following legitimate domains may be used during this
check:
ipecho[.]net
api[.]ipify[.]org
checkip[.]amazonaws[.]com
ip[.]anysrc[.]net
wtfismyip[.]com
ipinfo[.]io
icanhazip[.]com
myexternalip[.]com
Table 1. Legitimate domains used by Trickbot Anchor_DNS module to conduct internet
connectivity checks.

2/19

Ryuk ransomware is typically denoted by a file named “RyukReadMe” placed onto the
system. This ransomware is often seen at the end of multi-stage attacks involving malware
such as Trickbot and, more recently, BazaLoader (also known as "BazarLoader"). In many
cases, Ryuk is not loaded onto the system until weeks or months after the initial infection.
Ryuk operators learn the victim network by enumerating the impacted environment with tools
that may be familiar to that environment, such as PowerShell and Windows Management
Instrumentation.
Prior to encryption, the following commands may be run on a compromised system:
C:\Windows\System32\net.exe stop audioendpointbuilder /y
C:\Windows\System32\net.exe stop samss /y
C:\Windows\System32\net.exe stop MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS /y
You can review the joint cybersecurity advisory for additional details on Ryuk and Trickbot
activities associated with the targeting of Healthcare and the Public Health Sector.
The initial intrusion vector for both Trickbot and BazaLoader infections is most often
observed through malicious emails.
You can find recently confirmed Trickbot samples on MalwareBazaar and additional
information on Trickbot modules on the Unit 42 blog.
Recent samples of Ryuk and BazaLoader can also be found on MalwareBaazar.
More information on ransomware can be found in the 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat
Report.

Table 2. Courses of Action for Ryuk and Trickbot.
†These capabilities are part of the NGFW security subscriptions service.

Conclusion
Ryuk ransomware infections often result from multi-stage threat activities originating from
malware such as Trickbot and BazaLoader. Once the backdoor malware is established,
attackers use tools such as PowerShell and CobaltStrike to attain remote connection and
drop Ryuk onto the compromised system, sometimes weeks to months after initial infection.
The U.S. Government has deemed this threat activity as an imminent threat to Healthcare
and the Public Health Sector industry.
Indicators associated with this Threat Assessment and the joint cybersecurity alert are
available on GitHub, have been published to the Unit 42 TAXII feed and are viewable via the
ATOM Viewer:
https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/ryuk-ransomware/
https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/trickbot/
Palo Alto Networks security subscriptions for the Next-Generation Firewall with WildFire
detect activity associated with Trickbot and Ryuk. The DNS Security subscription is able to
detect the Anchor_DNS DNS tunneling described in this blog. Cortex XDR also contains an
Anti-Ransomware Protection module as well as an Anti-Malware Protection module, which
targets encryption-based activities associated with ransomware and other malicious file
behaviors. Additionally, AutoFocus customers can review activity related to this threat activity
with the following tags: Ryuk, Trickbot and BazaLoader.
Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of
compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members. CTA members
use this intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically
disrupt malicious cyber actors. For more information on the Cyber Threat Alliance, visit
