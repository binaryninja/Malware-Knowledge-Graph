To what extent do the Chinese cyber-warriors--within the People‟s Liberation Army along with both state and
non-state sponsored hackers/crackers--represent a viable threat to both the security and prosperity of our nation as
a whole? In the past several years the Chinese have developed a myriad of both lethal and non-lethal cyberweapons with the intention of denying or degrading an adversary‟s ability to use space-based intercommunication
network platforms. The PRC and PLA have demonstrated a rapid expansion of their asymmetric operations,
especially in the realm of Cyberspace. This paper will seek to ascertain the United States military‟s ability to
defend and enforce our national interests, both in regards to our own domestic infrastructures as well as our
partners abroad from Chinese-directed cyber-attacks.

CYBER-WARRIORS by LCDR Jorge Muñiz, Jr., USN, 85 pages.
To what extent do the Chinese cyber-warriors--within the People‟s Liberation Army
along with both state and non-state sponsored hackers/crackers--represent a viable threat
to both the security and prosperity of our nation as a whole? In the past several years the
Chinese have developed a myriad of both lethal and non-lethal cyber-weapons with the
intention of denying or degrading an adversary‟s ability to use space-based
intercommunication network platforms. The PRC and PLA have demonstrated a rapid
expansion of their asymmetric operations, especially in the realm of Cyberspace. This
paper will seek to ascertain the United States military‟s ability to defend and enforce our
national interests, both in regards to our own domestic infrastructures as well as our
partners abroad from Chinese-directed cyber-attacks.

their support throughout this past year. To my beautiful wife, Michelle, I thank you for
your undying patience and resilience, for pushing me to keep focused and on track, for
believing in me, even when I didn‟t believe in myself, and for putting up with all my
senseless U.S.-China tirades over hundreds of lunches and dinners. Everything I‟ve
accomplished is because of you and your never-ending support, so dedicating this thesis
to you is only a small token of my gratitude. To both our sons, Xavier and Ethan, thank
you for your understanding and consideration during the long nights spent at the library
with a mountain of lifeless books vice fishing or playing ball.
To my Thesis Committee, I wish to extend my sincere gratitude for each of your
respective knowledge, expertise, and guidance throughout the year. For my Chair,
Colonel Parks, thank you for keeping me on point, vice allowing my thesis to digress
down a China-Taiwan rat hole, as it could have easily done. For Tim Thomas, thank you
for your inspiring books that stirred me over 5-years ago to pursue further knowledge in
this field of study. Finally, to Bob King, thank you for jumping in at the last minute to
save my paper from utter destruction.
Last, but not least, to all my U.S./Singaporean Army brethren and our one token
Air Force Major in Staff Group 14D, I‟ve learned more this year than I ever thought I
could. Each of you had more than a little part to do with this thesis, whether through
loaning books, sharing your China-related knowledge and experiences with me,
proofreading poorly written pages but encouraging me to not give up, or even arguing
with me incessantly on the validity of the term “kinetic operations.” Thank you!

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent the Chinese cyberwarriors--within the People‟s Liberation Army (PLA) along with both state and non-state
sponsored hackers/crackers--represent a viable threat to both the security and prosperity
of our nation as a whole. Additionally, this paper will seek to ascertain the United States
military‟s ability to defend and enforce our national interests, both in regards to our own
domestic infrastructures as well as our partners abroad, from Chinese-directed cyberattacks; with special focus given to those systems critical to the Soldier on the battlefield.
Finally, the paper will evaluate legal precedent, both internationally and domestic, in
order to determine viable courses of action when confronted with an escalation of force in
the Cyberspace.
There are many secondary questions which arise from the aforementioned thesis
statements, such as how will China signal intent in situations involving their cyberwarfare capabilities? What thresholds should be established for an appropriate military
response and what assets or tools do we have at our disposal to respond to these threats?
If our current status or structure is insufficient, how does one propose reinforcing our
U.S. Government capabilities to counter a Chinese threat?
Based on the subject matter in question, it is critical first and foremost that one
clearly defines two major topics that are to be repeated throughout the thesis. First, on
the term Cyberspace, Joint Publication 1-02 (as of October 2008) defines it as: A global
domain within the information environment consisting of the: interdependent network of
information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications
1

networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. (CJCS CM-036308) This definition, however, is not a delimiter to the extent of what Cyberspace actually
is. As such, and for the purposes of the remainder of this thesis, Cyberspace will
encompass not only the actual military and civil electronics devices, but also the
electromagnetic spectrum on which the information (be it either Command, Control,
Communications, or Intelligence: C3I) travels to or from the end users. Additionally, the
domain of Cyberspace must include the medium through which the C3I travels, be it
wired, wireless, or space; and the associated defenses thereof. Therefore, space-based
platforms along with their associated land-based controllers also reside in the Cyberspace
domain. Finally, Cyberspace must include the physical platforms used to store, modify,
and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.
A second critical concept to understand up front, and especially when evaluating
the likelihood of a Chinese cyber-attack is that of the assassin‟s mace (shashoujian). The
PLA endeavors for high-tech gear and knowledge; their focus is on six major areas,
however the two directly related to this thesis are: military information technology and
military space technology.1 The PLA understand the role revolutions in military affairs
have played in history, and they seek to identify those new combat methods that represent
China‟s future “shock and awe;” devastating enough to deter any further U.S. military
action in a crisis, but clearly decisive in its use of surprise. PLA Colonels Li Daguang
and Jia Junming have both publically urged the development of an assassin‟s mace to
“meet the requirements of defeating the United States in a war over Taiwan.”2
Several major issues surfaced in 1999 when the PLA began incorporating
offensive computer network operations (CNO) into military exercises, “primarily in first2

strike tactics against enemy networks.” 3 The Chinese government, the People‟s Republic
of China (PRC), has even issued a Chinese Defense Policy white paper that confirms
what the U.S. Government has known for some time, that “[t]he PLA is carrying out a
strategic project for training a large contingent of new-type and high-caliber military
personnel… competent for operational tasks under conditions of informationization
(sic).”4 From the U.S. perspective, in 2007 General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has confirmed that “China is actively engaging in cyberreconnaissance . . . of U.S. Government agencies.”5 Meanwhile, underground civilian
organizations, from The Green Army to the likely state-sponsored Red Hacker Alliance
(RHA), have participated in corporate and industrial espionage by “scanning for
weaknesses in Pentagon information systems „for fun.‟”6
The problem with Chinese cyber-warriors is that the U.S. military relies heavily
on unrestricted intercommunications networks, both military-controlled as well as nonmilitary commercial systems, so too must we ensure their proper defense. However, in
the past several years the Chinese have developed a myriad of both lethal and non-lethal
cyber-weapons with the intention of denying or degrading an adversary‟s ability to use
space-based intercommunication network platforms.7 The PRC and PLA have
demonstrated a rapid expansion of their asymmetric operations, especially in the realm of
Cyberspace. What courses of action does the U.S. have prepared in the event of a
Chinese cyber-war?
The Chinese Cyber-threat
The U.S. economy and national security are fully dependent upon information
technology and the information infrastructure. Terrorists might attempt cyber attacks to
3

disrupt critical information networks, or attempt to cause physical damage to information
systems that are integral to the operation of . . . commerce systems. Tools and
methodologies for attacking information systems are becoming widely available, and the
technical abilities and sophistication of terrorist groups bent on causing havoc or
disruption is increasing.8
Having frequently been the target of several CNE attempts originating from PLA
training centers to Beijing cyber-cafés, the U.S. has sustained damages ranging from
Zero-Day Exploits,9 to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, to Reverse Shell
espionage. Unfortunately, the successful targets of such attacks have included the U.S.
Department of Defense (DoD),10 the U.S. Department of State,11 and multiple private
sector corporations.12 As recently as 06 March 2009, in which Canadian researcher, Nart
Villeneuve uncovered a network, dubbed GhostNet, of more than 1,200 infected
computers worldwide which were unequivocally directed through servers located in
China (one was controlled by a Chinese government server located in Hainan Island, a
known PLAN submarine base).13
In addition to traditional computer targets such as the DoD‟s Non-Secure Internet
Protocol Router Networks (NIPRNET), there are several non-traditional cyber-targets
such as our U.S. satellite networks and military-grade electronic emissions that are
paramount on the Chinese researcher‟s mission-set. Target sets such as these fall well
outside the traditional hacker‟s capabilities. However, the PLA under their new
directives, have been feverously developing anti-satellite capabilities of a lethal nature.
From directed-energy (DE) high-powered microwave disruptors to free-electron and high
energy lasers, 14 and from the lethal demonstrations of a DF-21 missile shoot-down of one
4

of their own aging weather satellites15 to the mass development of $800 briefcase-sized
transient electromagnetic devices (TED), 16 the face of warfare has changed.
As such, the U.S. military has made changes to expand beyond the operational
concepts of strictly independent CNO, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Space Operations to
instead be incorporated within the overarching and ethereal, but “physical,” domain of
Cyberspace. Not dissimilar to the domains of Land, Sea, and Air. There are now three
mission areas in Cyberspace: counter-cyber operations, cross-domain operations, and
support to civil authorities and the defense industry. 17
This paper ultimately seeks to answer whether the U.S. military is capable of
defending our national interests both domestically and abroad against a cyber-attack
originating from Chinese cyber-warriors, either state sponsored or PLA-trained.
Unfortunately, in this world of interdependent markets and economies on a truly global
scale, those who would rely solely upon the benefits of the worldwide
telecommunications network inevitably create vulnerabilities for themselves.18 The same
holds true for the Soldier or Marine relying on Blue Force Tracker for Command and
Control (C2), GPS for navigation, INMARSAT for communication, or Predator feeds for
situational awareness… or the Sailor relying on Naval Tactical Data Systems (NTDS) for
over-the-horizon targeting, Bridge to Bridge (B2B) for maritime navigation, Voyage
Management System (VMS) for transit routing, or the Global Command and Control
System (GCCS) for situational awareness and command and control (C2). While each
method rides over different mediums and on different frequencies, each taking up
different quantities of bandwidth, they all reside in the aforementioned domain of
Cyberspace.

The Nationalist Cyber-Terrorist
The Chinese hacker origins date back to 1994 when the Internet was first became
available to the PRC. Back then, access was severely limited to those with enough
money to afford, and patience to endure, the 9,600 bit/sec modems. This access was
further limited to Bulletin Board Systems, the precursor to the World Wide Web.19
Chinese restrictions on Internet access were lifted two years later; bringing the Internet
into the homes of millions. It was the following year, 1997, that the Green Army20 was
founded. Self-proclaimed as one of China‟s earliest hacker organizations with a
membership of over 3000 people from Shanghai, Beijing, and Shijaizhuang, this
“enduring symbol of the Chinese hacker movement”21 disbanded in 2000 due to financial
hardship. However, this was not before a loose quasi-coalition of confederated hackers
joined forces in response to the 1998 riots in Jakarta, Indonesia.
Blaming the PRC for their out of control inflation, the citizens of Indonesia
directed a massacre against their own Chinese nationals. The Chinese governments
chose to filter the incident from public view, but not before the atrocities were broadcast
over the Internet. Essentially, a virtual Chinese Hacker‟s Emergency Conference22 was
held resulting in a military-type cyber-envelopment using e-mail Logic Bombs. Postings
on many major Indonesian websites included such:
Your site has been hacked by a group of hackers from China. Indonesian thugs,
there can be retribution for your atrocities, stop slaughtering the Chinese people.23
Seeing this as a viable, non-lethal alternative to protracted conflicts, the PRC
began emphasizing a concept of Comprehensive National Power24 whereby both the
military and the civilian roles become integrated on behalf of the nation. State6

sponsored, but civilian, organizations quickly and gladly assumed the role of protector of
national interests. Chinese hacker groups such as the Honker Union of China, the Red
Hacker Alliance, and the Chinese Red Guest Network Security Technology Alliance
would seek out targets of opportunity to attack. 25 It was therefore only a matter of time
before the U.S. Armed Forces became the targets of their coordinated wrath.
In 1999, after U.S. planes bombed Beijing‟s embassy in Belgrade, Chinese
hackers quickly commenced cyber-battles with their respective U.S. counterparts. 26 In
2001, following the mid-air collision of a U.S. EP-3 and a Chinese AN-124 on April 1st,
the ensuing political conflict between the two powers prompted Chinese nationalists to
rise up once again. Hackers soon after organized a massive week-long campaign of
cyber-attacks against over 1200 U.S. sites to include the White House, U.S. Air Force,
Department of Energy, Department of Labor, and Department of Health and Human
Services. 27
Assumptions
There are several assumptions that must be presented up front if we are to
presume this thesis to be valid. First, the PRC has actively exploited the Microsoft Office
source codes with the malicious intent of using them against the United States
Government. Additionally the PRC sees cyber-warfare a first-strike option and is
training and equipping the PLA in the conduct of such. With regards to Chinese
“hacktivism,” despite the fact that DoD and security officials remain divided over (1)
whether the known cyber-attacks are coordinated or sponsored by the Chinese
government, (2) whether they are the work of individual and independent hackers, or (3)
whether the cyber-attacks are being initiated by some third-party organization that is
7

using network servers in China to disguise the true origins of the attacks, this thesis must
assume at a minimum that the PRC is either fully aware of their existence or actually
provides the mechanisms for their actions through either financial, informational, or via
protection of those non-military individuals with the specific intent that they continue to
conduct both Computer Network Exploitations (CNEs) and CNAs against the U.S.
Government.
Limitations
In limiting the depth of this thesis, the focus will primarily be on those cyberactivities between the U.S. and China when not involved in an official state of war or
involved in undeclared conflict. That implies that the thesis will not cover those PRC
activities intended to assist non-state actors through funding, intelligence, or protection
by the PRC and whose cyber-goals are operations intended to probe or attack the U.S. In
addition, it will not evaluate the use of force by the U.S. military against recreational
hackers, terrorists, or organized cyber-criminals as those comprise a law enforcement
issue which must be addressed through bilateral extradition vice military action.
Another limitation is that all discussions will be restricted to actions initiated from
within the borders of China. Therefore, U.S.-originated domestic cyber-activities will not
be included; this consists of those domestic actions that are of direct assistance in a
coordinated Chinese cyber-attack. Domestic CNE, again even in direct support of a
coordinated Chinese cyber-attack, will also not be discussed because it is a domestic law
enforcement issue. Neither will any other aspect of Information Operations (IO, Military
Deception, Psychological Operation, or Operational Security) be discussed with the
exception of how cyber-activities can be used to support IO.
8

Background: Taiwan and the Prelude to Cyber-War
It would be a stretch to imply that current cyber-tensions between the U.S. and
China are simply due to the continued existence of the island-nation of Taiwan.
However, it would also be a mistake to completely dismiss the events which have shaped
the environment in the Far East since World War II. That said, in 1949 the former leader
of China, Chiang Kai-shek, fled mainland China and relocated the Republic of China‟s
(ROC) seat of government to the island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa. Kaishek continued to claim sovereignty over all of mainland China from his island-hideout
in Taipei, Taiwan.
Mainland China, however, had other plans for the island following the Chinese
Civil War in 1949, in which the victorious Communist Party of China gained complete
control under Mao Zedong. Mao moved to establish the People‟s Republic of China
(PRC) and claim sole representation of China to include Taiwan, to which Zedung would
assert, was illegitimately led.28 Taiwan remained under martial law from 1948 until
1987, when Chiang Kai-shek‟s eventual successor, Lee Teng-hui, began the gradual
democratization and liberalization of the ROC‟s governmental system. However, it was
then that the controversial issues surrounding the political status of the Taiwanese
government resurfaced. Beginning with the banking system, Teng-hui authorized the
printing of banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan.
Soon after, President Teng-hui forced the disbanding of the Taiwan Provincial
Government as well as demanding the resignations of the Legislative Yuan and National
Assembly . . . both of whom were established in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese

9

constituencies. Finally, Teng-hui lifted all restrictions on the use of the Taiwanese
language in both broadcasting and schools.
This entire discussion of Taiwan, to include their assertions of sovereignty from
mainland China, ultimately resulted in one of the most significant military standoffs
involving the U.S. and China. The root cause stemmed from a simple visit to Cornell
University by the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui. The People‟s Republic of China
(PRC) took this visit as a serious affront to their communist-orthodox definition of what
Taiwan‟s place in the world was. The PRC had expected that then-President Bill Clinton
would block Lee‟s visit for the betterment of U.S.-China relations, but he did not. China
very soon thereafter became engaged in a series of aggressive military demonstrations
involving the firing of 6 ballistic missiles impacting just 80 miles off the Taiwanese
coast. President Clinton understood that he could no longer assume peace in the Taiwan
Straits and that the seemingly innocent visit had triggered deep emotional reactions
between the two sides, with the U.S. in the middle.29
Believing power-projection to be the appropriate response to PRC aggression,
U.S. leaders ordered two U.S. carrier strike groups to maneuver between the narrow
waters separating Taiwan from mainland China--the Taiwan Straits. Lee sought to
reassure the PRC that he did not intend to declare independence; Clinton sought to
convince the PRC that we wanted to retain good relations with China, however, he was
ready to defend Taiwan if needed.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
The purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent the Chinese cyberwarriors represent a viable threat to both the security and prosperity of our nation as a
whole. To shape this effort, Chapter 2 will introduce in detail a myriad of literature
covering the three main cyber-threats originating from China (again, recalling that this
thesis will not evaluate recreational hacktivists) ; these are the People‟s Republic of
China, the PLA, and the state-sponsored Chinese nationalist (or Honker). Each will be
covered in the sub-chapter of China on China.
The paper, more importantly, seeks to ascertain our ability to defend and enforce
our national interests, both in regards to our own domestic infrastructures, as well as our
partners abroad, from Chinese-directed cyber-attacks. To that end, this chapter will also
cover the current legal implications both domestically and internationally with regards to
the U.S. military and their use of force in Cyberspace. Additionally, the literature review
will also incorporate those specific national interests that would require defending with
respect to Cyberspace both domestically and abroad.
Chapter 2 is broken down in three distinct sub-chapters representing either their
author‟s predominant point of view or their primary literature‟s focus and they are
labeled: China on China, United States‟ Perception of China, and finally, United States
on the United States. This holistic approach is intended to not only satisfy the
requirement of a literature review, but also to shape the reader‟s understanding as to the
depth and give the reader insight into the complex nature that is Cyberspace.

13

China on China
This sub-chapter will review the literature originating from within the borders of
China and specifically those books or articles covering such topics as the leadership
within the PRC and the guiding Generals within the PLA who execute their direction.
First of all, it is important to note that the PLA publishing system consists of 28
publishing houses; 16 newspapers (such as PLA Daily); and hundreds of periodicals1
(such as China Militia and China Air Force). Their breadth represents an essential
component of the PLA‟s ability to function as an institution. Unfortunately, for the
purposes of research, it is important to note that the PLA publishing system has also been
used to exercise political control and disseminate propaganda to both the Chinese
population as well as to the rest of the world, to maintain organizational cohesion
amongst the PLA services, to reform and modernize their officer corps through
professional development, and to serve as civil-military proxy between the civilian
population and the PLA that are tasked to defend them2. The PLA leadership views
propaganda as a capability through which they can externalize their “soft power” while
countering negative criticism as this PLA Daily (Jiefangjun Bao) article states that
propaganda is “an important channel through which the PLA can improve its soft power
and display the good image of the Chinese soldiers.”3

All books and articles--even those written by military subject matter experts--are
still vetted through the General Political Department (the GPD, who incidentally also
oversees the Propaganda Department) who supervises, or censors, each publication
before going into the PLA publishing system. Therefore, while the quantity of usable
information specific to the thesis topic seems to be limited, it is actually the credibility of
the information found in PLA books and publications that is of greatest concern.

15

PLA on Unrestricted Warfare
Rarely, a whole book manages to either circumvent the GPD vetting process, or is
intentionally released for psychological purposes in an effort to satisfy United Nations
(U.N.) Resolution 35/142B (Military Transparency). One such book, Unrestricted
Warfare (超限战, literally "warfare beyond bounds") was initially published by the PLA
Literature and Arts Publishing House in Beijing (Figure 1), and therefore suggests that it
was endorsed at least by some elements of the PLA leadership. It is a book on military
strategy that was authored, in part, as a response to the PLA‟s fascination with our
successes in the first Gulf War. Written in 1999 by two colonels in from the PLAAF,
Qiao Liang (乔良) and Wang Xiangsui (王湘穗), it reveals how China believes it can
overcome our military‟s technological advantages and defeat the U.S. through a myriad
of “total warfares;” the two of which most directly apply to this thesis: technology
warfare and network warfare. However, Qiao and Wang are not so rudimentary as to
stop there. They go on to overtly imply, for example, that the attacking side of two
developed nations might employ strictly military force-on-force techniques that
incorporate “satellite reconnaissance, electronic countermeasures, large-scale air attack
plus precision attacks, ground outflanking, amphibious landings, [and] air drops behind
enemy lines.”4 Contrary to the force-on-force, they suggest a better alternative in the
form of a “combination method” that includes not only military techniques, but also
trans-military and non-military capabilities. They therefore suggest that:
If the attacking side secretly musters large amounts of capital without the enemy
nation being aware of this at all and launches a sneak attack against its financial
markets, then after causing a financial crisis, buries a computer virus and hacker
detachment in the opponent‟s computer system in advance, while at the same time
carrying out a network attack against the enemy so that the civilian electricity
16

network, traffic network, and mass media network are completely paralyzed, this
will cause the enemy nation to fall into social panic, street riots, and a political
crisis.5
This example ends with the attacking military force bearing down on the
vanquished foe until a “dishonorable peace treaty” is signed. This is the crux of
Unrestricted Warfare and the Chinese cyber-warrior represents the first in a line of viable
“combinations” that can be used against the U.S. and her allies.
Finally, with respect to “Unrestricted Warfare,” Qiao and Wang proceed to
describe “kinder weapons” to which they suggests a tank‟s combat capabilities can be
hard destroyed with either a missile or cannon, however, a kinder option would be to
destroy its optical equipment with a directed energy weapon. Under kinder weapons, he
suggests that there are two flavors: “hard destruction” as in an electro-magnetic pulse
(EMP), and reversible “soft-strikes” as in computer logic bombs, network viruses, or
DDoS attack. “Both [he claimed] are focused on paralyzing and undermining, not
personnel casualties.”6
PLA on Information Operations
Essentially, the “Research on Information Warfare Issues in Our Military”
(Wojun Xinxizhan Wenti Yanjiu) is a compilation of some of China‟s most prominent
Information Operations theories and practices as they apply to the PLA. Its editor, Peng
Chencang, pulled from several dozen experts, however, none as prominent or outspoken
as then-Major General Dai Qingmin. Dai elaborated on the exploitation of the Battlefield
Information Environment (BIE) to gain combat advantage. He goes on to assert that
there are three elements that compose the BIE; they are the fields of electromagnetism,

17

computers and their networks, and human society (which will not be covered in this
thesis).
Dai claimed that it is the electromagnetic field, which he also coined as the “main
field,” in which BIE exists. He also asserted that in future combat, China will face an
electromagnetic signal space with denser and more complex signals. For example, he
lists not only the electromagnetic waves, but also light and sound waves as well. On the
topic of computers and their associated networks, Dai believed that on future battlefields
there will become a huge reliance on both the information processing and dissemination
via Cyberspace; resulting in new types of combat such as “hacker warfare, network
warfare, and computer virus warfare.”7 This all seems very rudimentary, that is until Dai
explains how the BIE has its own unique characteristics and capabilities, thereafter
mimicking the sentiments of Qiao and Wang‟s Unrestricted Warfare once again.
In Unrestricted Warfare the reader is introduced to the concept of “combination
methods” in which an enemy nation could be met with not only cyber-warfare, but also
diplomatic, financial, trade, drug, terrorist, ideological, and even ecological warfare. Dai,
in his submission echoes these sentiments by overtly bringing in the factor of “domestic
combat information systems” (or nationalist Chinese “Hacktivists”) into the fold. Dai
claims that within the information era the “fusing and sharing of military and commercial
information facilities and technologies [so that] the boundaries between military, nonmilitary, global and BIE will gradually become ambiguous.”8 Dai describes pieces of
China‟s possible Course of Action (COA) utilizing what can only be construed again as
Chinese nationalists by conducting an “invasion, attack, and damage of enemy classified

18

information networks [using either] opposing military organizations (PLA) or from an
unknown hacker with no association to any government.”9
Dai, without directly saying either the U.S. or Taiwan, successfully calls out both
nations:
…whether for counter-invasion warfare or unification or the motherland, we will
stand our ground in homeland combat. Contrary to the enemy, which will
undergo a long mobilization away from home, we have the factor of convenience
in utilizing the foundational information facilities . . . all can be converted for
military use in wartime.10
Dai expounds on this rhetoric just one year later when he called upon uniting
civilian and the PLA under a single common telecom system to meet both peacetime and
wartime needs. In Dai‟s “Innovating and Developing Views on Information Operations”
he defines the “target” as the military information and information systems, and the
“principal form[s]” encompassing both EW and CNO. He also emphasized that future
operations must be integrated, meaning both military and civilian fighting forces.
Finally, Dai lays out ten cyber-stratagems as follows: plant information mines, conduct
information reconnaissance, changing network data, releasing information bombs,
dumping information garbage, disseminating propaganda, applying information
deception, releasing clone information, organizing information defense, and establishing
network spy stations.11
PLA in Chinese Periodicals
The PLA Daily (Jiefangjun Bao) and China National Defense News are the only
two PLA newspapers designated and written specifically for public consumption
(gongkai; 公开). Public distribution of these newspapers began in 1987, with the goal of
giving the general public the opportunity to read about PLA affairs in a state-sponsored
19

publication. Since then, this goal has been furthered by the introduction of Internet
editions, such as the PLA Daily online edition, which is also available to the Chinese
public.12 In a March 2007 PLA Daily Online article, the former-director of the Chinese
PLA Communications Department and current director of the PLA‟s Advisory
Committee for Informationalization, Major General Dai Qingmin (a known advocate of
the pre-emptive cyber-attack to gain the initiative and seize information superiority13)
was interviewed on both network and national security. During the interview he revealed
the development of computer operating systems that are completely self-dominated and
free of intellectual property rights (an open sourced Linux-style operating system, for
example) as well as the development of an internal (military) professional training
system14 relating to the topic of “informationalization” (sic).
Over the past several years, PLA Daily has, along with several other well-read
Chinese periodicals, documented the growth and development of their armed forces. For
example, since post 9/11, the Hong Kong Journal began an in depth analysis of the
Taiwanese “Hankuang 18” exercises. This 2002 journal emphasized Taiwan‟s
participation in a computer network warfare training exercise codenamed “Lusheng II.”
The PLA General Staff Department quickly directed relevant combat units of the PLA to
study and analyze the “Lusheng II” warfare tactics, and to come up with countermeasures
as quickly as possible. However, the same article backs current Chinese research and
development by reminding their readers of three main points: first, the China‟s maturing
satellite technology with surveillance and future positioning capabilities; second, the
establishment of specialized IW units tasked with both developing computer viruses to
sabotage enemy computer systems as well as guarding the PLA‟s computer systems; and
20

finally, the development of institutions of higher learning with regards to IW, such as the
PLA Information Engineering University, which had at the time “developed unique
characteristics in . . . information security . . . telecommunications engineering . . . and
space information and surveying technology”15
Chinese periodicals have also indicated a vested interest by the PLA in counterreconnaissance and active surveillance jamming techniques. The first of these deception
means, counter-reconnaissance, involves passively applying advanced camouflage
techniques coupled with natural environmental conditions to defeat U.S. reconnaissance
systems. While this is not a traditional application of PLA cyber-warriors, their efforts
signal intent to develop passive asymmetric counter-Cyberspace means. For example,
the Jinan Military Region (MR, Figure 1) held their region‟s Winter Field Training
exercise in 2007 where all three armies (20th, 26th, and 54th) held counterreconnaissance drills against “high-tech reconnaissance means.”16 The PLA Daily
covered the same period, focusing on the 54th Group Army. The 54th carried out
innovative, although questionably useful, countermeasures such as road-side dispersals,
creating smoke screens, hiding in ravines, and even intermixing with civilian tragic on
highways.17
During times of war or national emergency, War Zone Headquarters (WZHQ)
will be established based primarily on the Military Regions (Figure 1). The WZHQ will
have command of all forces in all branches of service in their respective regions. Similar
to U.S. military operations, the PLA divides military operations into phases according to
terrain, task, or time (reminiscent of Milan Vego‟s: space, force, time). Dennis J. Blasko
explains in his 2006 The Chinese Army Today that WZHQ, beyond traditional military
21

units, may employ local forces (People‟s Armed Police), as well as militia augmented by
civilian forces18 (which does not preclude the nationalist cyber-warriors). PLA Daily, in
2007, covered the PLAAF‟s enlistment of their militia in the Tangshan Military
Subdistrict (Beijing MR, Figure 1) to assist in camouflaging air defense positions. In this
case, the militia also used dubious means to obscure their adversary‟s bomb damage
assessment, which included fire, lights, smoke, and electronics to “hide or transform the
shape of important infrastructures, such as oil depots, power plants, and bridges.”19
The second deception means, active surveillance jamming techniques, certainly
fall within the domain of Cyberspace. In an interview with Bingqi Zhishi an “expert”
suggested that it was possible to electronically jam the telemetry control signal between
ground control and surveillance satellites. Taiwan‟s Taipei Times reported in 2006 that
Chinese have already developed a form of laser dazzling and have used that technique on
U.S. military satellites.20
On issues of electronic warfare (EW), however, the Chinese research and
development has clearly recognized the increasingly greater role that both EW and
electronic counter measures (ECM) play in a modern warfare. In the Chengdu MR
(Figure 1), experiments are still ongoing to test and evaluate the jamming effectiveness
from the jamming side. In an article published in the Dianzi Xinxi Juikang Jishu, several
renowned scientists and scholars challenged the traditional jamming parameters of
measuring signal-to-noise interference ratio at the receiver, max transmission range at the
transmitter site, detection zone (specifically for radar systems), the suppression
coefficient, the discover probability, and the deceit probability.21 Instead, they propose
that this method is only effective in a field test situation and is essentially worthless in a
22

war as “the jamming side cannot possibly obtain these evaluation data on the enemy…
directly.”22 The authors, Li Chao and Zhou Jinquan, are research scientists for the
Missile Institute of Air Force Engineering University and the Military Academy of the
PLA, respectively. So their insight and analysis most-closely resembles what one should
expect to encounter when facing and informationalized PLA.
The aforementioned periodical also published an article on the “Multi-Signal
Jamming Technology in [a] Complex Environment” written by Li Dongxin, a researcher
from the National Keu Lab of Information Integrated Control in the Chengdu MR (Figure
1). In it, Dongxin reviews the two main radar jamming technologies used for PLA ECM:
multi-pulse velocity-range decoys and multi-pulsed false target jamming. Either
technique is intended to target a pulsed-Doppler radar system‟s (the non-phased array
systems still used by our military forces) capability to not only detect target location
(bearing, range, and altitude) but also a target‟s radial velocity (range-rate). Specifically,
Dongxin‟s conclusion is that in an increasingly complex multi-signal environment, ECM
equipment has no choice but to make fundamental improvements.23
Finally, on the topic of direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signals, the same
periodical published an article on “DSSS Signal Parameter Estimation” written by Chen
Ximing and Huang Shuoyi. In it they admit that both detection and parameter
estimations have become a difficult problem, especially as they relate to jamming.
Unfortunately, this form of digital communication serves an essential role in both U.S.
military (GPS and Galileo) and civilian (CDMA, LRCP, 802.11b, etc) purposes. DSSS
provides secured communications, multi-address communications, and satellite
navigation and location. Ximing and Shouyi ultimately assert that one of the key steps in
23

conducting non-cooperative communications (or simply electronic surveillance, ES) is to
“obtain signal modulation parameters, code period, chip rate, and carrier wave
frequency.”24
On the topic of the most recent scandal, the blatant and highly publicized Chinese
cyber-spying via zombie U.S. and Chinese servers, also known as GhostNet, China
quickly countered through a myriad of publications. First, in the most widely read China
Daily, military analyst and Beijing-based strategist Song Xiaojun claimed that “this [was]
purely another political issue that the West is trying to exaggerate [and] as China grows,
some in the West are trying every opportunity to manufacture fears over China‟s
threat.”25 Second, in an interview with Professor Zhu Feng, from the School of
International Studies in Peking noted that “cyber security has been a global issue . . .
those who see China as an emerging threat again [have] picked the new subject as a
weapon.”26 Finally, in Beijing‟s Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao) information security
expert, Qiu Feng, pointed out that “. . . creating such a huge network and (sic) organizing
personnel and coordinating attacks in different countries is not an easy matter. . . . This
story is full of loopholes. There is insufficient evidence to say that China has such a huge
overseas spy network.”27
United States‟ Perception of China
[The] goal of a space shock and awe strike is [to] deter the enemy, not to provoke
the enemy into combat. For this reason, the objectives selected for strike must be
few and precise . . . [for example] on important information sources, command
and control centers, communications hubs, and other objectives. This will shake
the structure of the opponent‟s operational system of organization and will create
huge psychological impact on the opponent‟s policymakers.28
-- Colonel Zelu,, PLA, National Defense University

24

The PRC‟s interpretation with respect to what constitutes either an attack or the
legitimate use of force is vague at best. In the 2008 Annual Report to Congress on the
Military Power of the People‟s Republic of China (ARC 2008), we are reminded of
China‟s history (Korean War, 1950-1953; Indian conflict, 1962; Soviet conflict, 1969;
Vietnam, 1973) in which they charge their PLA with either the preemptive or coercive
use of force in an effort to advance their own core interests. The ARC 2008 overtly
implied that Chinese precedent demonstrates their territorial claims on Taiwan, quoting
Chinese Military theory “if any country or organization violates the other country‟s
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the other side will have the right to „fire the first
shot‟ on the plane of tactics.”29
The ARC 2008 goes on to include vague references to China‟s “Assassin‟s Mace”
(shashoujian) Programs in which part of the PLA‟s asymmetric warfighting strategy is to
use programs designed to give technologically inferior militaries advantages over
technologically superior adversaries. Since 1999, the ARC 2008 notes, the term has
appeared more frequently in PLA journals. Although not clearly specified in the ARC
2008, China‟s “Assassin‟s Mace” would likely be a mixture of old and new technologies
applied in unique ways, “particularly in the context of fighting the United States in a
Taiwan conflict.”30
U.S. on the Modernization of the PLA with respect to CNO
On CNO, the 2008‟s Report to Congress from the U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission (USCC 2008) acknowledges the critical vulnerability of the
U.S. Government and economy due to our heavy dependence on the Internet. As such,

25

the USCC 2008 presumes that China will likely seek to take advantage of this U.S.
reliance due to the following assessments:
1) The costs of Cyberspace operations are low in comparison with traditional
espionage or military activities.
2) Determining the origin of cyber-operations and attributing them to the
Chinese government or any other operator is difficult; hindering our response.
3) Cyber-attacks can be used to confuse us, the enemy.
4) There is an underdeveloped legal framework to guide responses
As such, China is very likely to continue pursuing CNO capabilities that may
provide them with an asymmetric advantage against the U.S.
As noted by Wang and Qiao in Unrestricted Warfare, China‟s perception of U.S.
success in the first Gulf War led to a growing number of CNO advocates amongst PLA
officials. Mark A. Stokes from the Strategic Studies Institute, and former U.S. military
attaché in Beijing, wrote back in 1999 on the Chinese enthusiasm and the concurrence
that called for the development of weapons systems that can “throw the financial system
and army command systems of the hegemonists (sic) into chaos.” Stokes goes on to note
that technological weapons of this nature provide an asymmetric advantage for an
underdeveloped country to use against a nation which is “extremely fragile and
vulnerable when it fulfills the process of networking and then relies entirely on electronic
computers.”31 PLA strategists, according to Stokes, have thus increased their emphasis on
computer warfare and have expanded to include the feasibility of introducing computer
viruses (bingdu) via wireless means. Stokes‟ assessment, written at the same time that
Unrestricted Warfare was published mimics the sentiments of Wang and Qiao on
combined warfare with specificity towards Financial Warfare + Network Warfare.

26

China‟s most recent cyber-snooping escapade painted the PRC into the proverbial
corner as the Canadian researcher, Nart Villeneuve, learned about the GhostNet
infiltration network through the use of honey-pots. Toronto‟s The Globe and Mail
revealed how Villeneuve‟s “honey-pot” computers were taken over. Mysterious entities
sought to reveal the honey-pots‟ processor speed, memory specifications, geographic
information as to its location, „My Documents‟ files, and finally given an instruction to
download a copy of the GhostNet remote-access tool. Villeneuve‟s evidence showed that
the majority of the “control servers were located in China . . . [and] the interface to
control the infected hosts on these servers in China was in Chinese,” and finally, the
“remote Trojan favoured (sic) by the attackers is a Trojan coded by Chinese hackers.”32
However, most disturbing of all was neither Chinese servers nor the Chinese-coded
Trojans; rather, the high value targets which include none other than Deloitte & Touche,
employer of over 165,000 professional in 140 countries delivering audit, tax, consulting,
and financial advisory services through its member firms.33 Recalling Qiao and Wang‟s
suggestion presented in Unrestricted Warfare of using a combined warfare, such as
network warfare with financial warfare.
U.S. on the Modernization of the PLA with Respect to EW
Chinese research and development clearly recognizes the greater role that
electronic warfare plays on the informationalization of their PLA. U.S. literature also
recognizes that Chinese leaders have prompted to accelerate the modernization of their
armed forces. For example, the Center for Strategic and International Studies published
Chinese Military Modernization in 2007, which emphasized the PLA force development
and strategic capabilities. As such, there is significant concentration in the development
27

of the PLA‟s technological base with emphasis on C4ISR.34 This statement is supported
in the U.S. DoD Annual Estimates of Information Warfare Capabilities and Commitment
of the PRC 2002-2009 where the author, Dr. Kabay, highlights the PLA‟s objective to
seize electromagnetic dominance. He described the combination of electronic warfare,
CNO, and lethal strikes as Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW).
U.S. on the Modernization of the PLA with Respect to ASAT and Space
The ARC 2008 noted that China has developed significant ASAT capabilities that
go far beyond those demonstrated by the direct-ascent shoot down of January 2007. They
include co-orbital kinetic weapons, directed energy weapons (both of which are still
under development) and micro-satellites. China is also developing electronic attack and
CNO techniques targetting an adversary‟s space assets as well as its ground support
networks. Finally, the ARC 2008 believes that the PLA consider „„battlefield situational
awareness‟‟ so critical to modern combat operations that the development of an offensive
“Assassin‟s Mace” weapon, specifically with space attack capability is required.
In an effort to counter our national interests in space, the PLA has developed
multi-dimensional space programs focused on limiting or preventing the use of satellitebased assets by their potential adversaries during times of conflict.35 Designed to exploit
a number of susceptible space assets, their research and development fall into two basic
categories of lethal-kill methods: either directed-energy or direct-ascent. Non-lethal
methods, however, targets one of two specific subcomponents of an adversary‟s space
collection capabilities: imagery collection, or signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection.
The Chinese have even expanding their CNO initiatives to include activities that threaten
the DoD‟s space control and supporting computer networks, thus posing a significant risk
28

to critical U.S. warfighting systems. Thankfully, U.S. military satellite communications
space assets are physically hardened or software protected in an effort to counter such
vulnerabilities… unfortunately, however, few of the U.S. military‟s commercially-leased
systems share this level of hardening.36 Thus, this brings China‟s space capabilities and
militarized intentions to a level of U.S. national interest, and the aforementioned threat to
our security and prosperity of our nation as a whole.
Although the PRC has never publically acknowledged a dedicated anti-satellite
(ASAT) program, the PLA has been intently interested in building the capacity to deny,
degrade, deceive, disrupt, delay, corrupt and even destroy their adversaries‟ use of space
based satellite platforms and their associated systems. The research and development to
achieve this has been ongoing since the 1960s; likely assisted by Mao Tse Tung‟s mid1950s ABMD rhetoric. Under their anti-ballistic missile defense (ABMD) 640 Program
of 1963, the PRC made their first attempts to build a system consisting of a lethal “kill”
vehicle, high powered lasers, and a space indications and warnings (I&W) network37.
Although the ABMD 640 Program was abandoned in the 1980‟s, the technology
developed set the stage for transition into China‟s High Technology Development 863
Program under Deng Xiaoping.
Dr. Michael Pillsbury, a Senior Fellow for the Atlantic Council of the U.S. and
Associate Fellow for the National Strategic Studies Asian Affairs, authored An
Assessment of China‟s Anti-Satellite and Space Warfare Program in 2007. Although his
assessment was not submitted to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission until a week after the Chinese ASAT incident of 2007, the depth and
breadth to which Pillsbury shaped the space environment cannot be dismissed. He
29

identifies the PLA‟s need to develop a covert space warfare operations as well as the
need for the PRC to build a “Space Army.” Capabilities of which, Pillsbury specified,
include a space-based ASAT network, ship and submarine-launched direct ascent ASAT
capabilities, plasma attacks against low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, and space electronic
jamming.38
Domestically, current U.S. DoD Space Policy is governed by and nested under the
National Space policy of August 2006 and focuses primarily on the operational
capabilities enabling our military services to fulfill their respective national security
space objectives. Both documents view space as a medium through which military
operations can take place--similar to the domains of land, sea, or air. As such, it falls
within our national interests to ensure space support, force enhancement, space control,
and force application continues unimpeded.39
Direct Ascent and Micro-Satellite ASATs
. . . the offensive capabilities in space should, if necessary, be capable of
destroying or temporarily incapacitating all enemy space vehicles that fly in space
above our sovereign territory 40
-- Colonel Li Daguang, PLA 2001
China‟s interpretation of the “peaceful use of space” (as delineated in the Outer
Space treaty of 1967) is clearly inconsistent with their development of the PLA space
weapons programs. As early as 2001, rhetoric concerning the development of an
offensive “Assassin‟s Mace” weapon, specifically with space attack capability, began
circulating. Colonel Li Daguang makes the particular point that “the offensive capability
in space should . . . be capable of destroying . . . all enemy space vehicles that fly in space
above our sovereign territory.”41 Later that year the PRC launched the Tsinghua-1, their
30

first 50 kg micro-satellite, revealing the Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1 Space Launch Vehicle
(SLV)) solid-fuel rocket and mobile LEO launch vehicle (Figure 2).
The January 2007 test of a direct-ascent ASAT weapon, for example, in which
they confirmed the PLA‟s ability to destroy satellites operating in a LEO, demonstrated
the culmination of years of research and development on their part. The target was an
aging Chinese FY-1C weather satellite operating in polar orbit at over 500 miles above
the earth. Pentagon officials would later identify the ASAT with the designator “SC-19”
and based on the KT-1 SLV. Although this was their third attempt to destroy the same
FY-1C satellite, their success confirms they have the capability to compromise the
continued operation of many of our LEO ISR platforms used for collection and
counterterrorism.42 Additionally, the debris field formed by said ASAT has the potential
to directly compromise the nearly 400 U.S. LEO satellites over the next 20 years.

Direct Ascent ASAT, 20 January 2007. http://www.strategycenter.net/research/
pubID.142/pub_detail.asp (accessed 18 March 2009).

With respect to this Chinese-created debris field, it is important to note that the
two aforementioned U.S. documents, the U.S. DoD Space Policy and the National Space
policy of August 2006; both are directly in line with the United Nations Treaties and
Principles on Outer Space, 2002. However, as both the U.S. and China are signatories of
said treaty, we are both obligated to the “cleanliness” of space under Articles VII and IX.
Article VII specifically emphasizes that states are “internationally liable for damage to
another State Party to the Treaty or to its natural or juridical persons by such object or its
component parts on the Earth, in air space or in outer space. . .”43 Additionally, Article
IX covers the responsible use of space in a way that avoids harmful contamination of
32

outer space; in short, both articles do not ally themselves with the Chinese direct-ascent
episode of 2007.
An alternative to a direct-ascent counter-satellite technology are China‟s coorbital micro-satellite network and their directed energy endeavors. On micro-satellites
there is the BX-1, a 40 kg possible ASAT released on September 27, 2008.44 Although
not conclusively a confirmed ASAT, the BX-1 did make a significantly close pass to the
International Space Station at a distance of only 45 km. Thus, the technology exists to
release an ultra-small, agile, and lightweight microsatellite to be used as an ASAT
platform.
Directed Energy, Kinetic Kill Vehicles, and Space Armies
Space armies should set up emergency launch units… in order to guarantee that
on the day it receives launch orders it will immediately launch space-based fire
platforms into orbit. 45
-- Prof Yuan Selu, PLA NDU 2005
Significantly more sophisticated than either the direct-ascent or co-orbital
microsatellites are the directed-energy ASAT. China currently has a policy of using
space peacefully and has argued against the militarization of the space environment.
However, they have also demonstrated the capabilities that ground-based and airborne
high-powered lasers can damage non-hardened thermal controls, optical sensors, and
solar power components on LEO satellites. For example, in September 2006, the
Pentagon acknowledged that China had fired a high-powered laser at a U.S.
reconnaissance satellite flying over Chinese territory.46
The PRC recognizes the U.S. utter dependence on space assets and has bolstered
their capabilities above and beyond the direct ascent demonstration of 2007. This will
33

not only potentially enable China to counter our asymmetric space advantage, but also
seeks to “guarantee the viability of Chinese nuclear forces in the face of emerging
American missile defenses.”47 Research on beam weapon proposals has been detailed by
more than 20 authors since 2005. Labeled as “new concept weapons” (or xin gainian
wuqi), directed energy weapons cover the gambit of iterations such as high power lasers,
microwaves, and particle beam weapons. 48
Significantly more subtle and clearly reversible technologies are in the completely
non-lethal realm such as jammers used to degrade or disrupt functionality without the
resultant debris caused by lethal ASAT weapons. Electronic jamming capabilities of the
PLA are divided into both hardware interference and command interference. Hardware
jamming includes disrupting the electronic surveillance functionality of the U.S. systems.
For example, UHF-band satellite communications jammers acquired in the late 90‟s from
the Ukraine give the PLA the indigenous capability to jam common U.S. Army satellite
communication bands and GPS receivers. Command jamming, on the other hand, refers
to China‟s jamming of the remote control and remote sensing systems of U.S. military
systems. Research and development in intercepting, decoding, and jamming of the
ground command is focused on making the satellite deviate from orbit, tumble, exploit, or
simply turn off. Command interference is a cost-effective and potentially non-lethal
weapon well within the realm of cyberspace.49
Targeting satellite terrestrial support infrastructures as well as employing noncontemporary alternatives such as microwaves, particle beams, and electromagnetic pulse
weapons, and these future technologies are all just on the PLA‟s horizon.50 While the
extents of China‟s ASAT capabilities are uncertain, what is clear is that the PLA is intent
34

of obtaining a form of Space Superiority. In our extremely heavy reliance on spacebased support systems, especially endemic in future and current technologies such as the
Future Combat System Brigade Combat Team (FCS (BCT)), Blue Force Tracker, Global
Command and Control System, Naval Tactical Data Systems, Unmanned Aerial Systems,
and INMARSAT, are all vulnerable targets.
Concerning PLA space operations, the USCC 2008 determined that the PLA “has
sufficient capability to meet many of [their] space goals.”51 Through new, space-based
assets, they have expanded significantly their electronic and signals intelligence
capabilities. This contributes greatly to their military‟s Command, Control,
Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)
projection capability out to, and including, the southern Pacific Ocean.
Finally, the PLA has been urged to develop space weapons that demonstrate
assassin‟s mace capabilities. As such, they have pushed for covert implementation of
space-based fire networks. This would employ standby emergency astronautic launches
that would not directly counter international space law. These mobile launch vehicle
weapons would employ both space-based directed and kinetic energy capabilities to
counter U.S. LEO network systems.52 Colonel Yuan Zelu, PLA, proposes a total war
option that would guarantee that once their space armies receive launch orders, they will
immediately fire their weapon systems into orbit.

United States on United States
Domestic Policy on Cyberspace
Under the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative
Current criminal provisions are essentially reactive by nature as they do not
specifically authorize jurisdictional hurdles hampering law enforcement and or military
action needed to address cyber-warriors operating abroad. However, both the Federal
Information Security Management Act of 2002 (hereafter FIMSA, USC Title 44 §3541,
addresses in a later subchapter) along with the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity
Initiative (CNCI) take preventative approaches to halting cyber-warriors.
In response to extensive cyber-intrusions into government and DoD computer
networks by both known and unknown actors (not necessarily Chinese in origin), the
Bush Administration in 2008 established the CNCI as a joint presidential directive. The
CNCI establishes the policy, strategy, and guidelines to secure the federal system53 while
collectively seeking to identify both current and emerging cyber-threats, establish
protection measures for current and future cyber-vulnerabilities, and delineate responses
to address entities wishing to steal or manipulate protected data on secure federal
systems. As of this thesis‟s composition, the U.S. is still within President Obama‟s 60day interagency cyber-security review (as of 09 February, 2009). Of note, two major
questions have emerged since the Bush Administrations departure that directly relates to
this thesis‟ topic: the adequacy of existing legal authorities for responding to cyberthreats (which will be addressed in follow-on subchapters), and the appropriate roles that
both the President and Congress will play in addressing cyber-security.54

36

In addressing the legality of Presidential responses to cyber-threats (up to and
including invoking war powers) both the Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recommended Executive action
to protect U.S. Cyberspace. When addressing the cyber-warriors, our Executive Branch
must find support in either the powers granted him as Commander-in-Chief (CINC)
under either Article II of the U.S. Constitution, or those congressionally delegated to him
via Article I powers.55 Unfortunately, the CNCI acknowledges that the scope of response
and especially the act of invoking war powers in with regards to cyber-warfare defies
traditional military strategies and may even fall outside the traditional definitions of
war.56 The CNCI give an example that with regards to private sector domestic cybersecurity (e.g. Yahoo! servers) war powers would not likely apply; however, the CINC
might well-assert his constitutional oath-based obligation to defend the nation from
imminent threats such as foreign cyber-intrusions or cyber-attacks.
In summary, as of this thesis‟ writing, Congress has yet to authorize the cybersecurity reforms proposed by the CNCI. Additionally, the FISMA does not authorize all
cyber-security protections, so the CINC is left with one of several options. He can call
upon the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force if a tie with the 9/11 attackers
could be made (doubtful in a case against Chinese cyber-warriors). However, it is more
likely that he will follow the advice of Mary Ann Davison, CSO for Oracle, who testified
before congress that “given the diversity of potentially hostile entities building cadres of
cyberwarrior . . . congress should consider developing a 21st century application of the
Monroe Doctrine.”57

37

Under U.S. Code
Regardless of the significant cyber-based threats to the U.S. Government and our
domestic national interests, the Use of Army and Air Force as Posse Comitatus (PCA, 18
USC §1385) significantly restricts DoD‟s ability to truly “dominate” Cyberspace.
Established as a U.S. Federal Law on June 16, 1878 after the conclusion of the
Reconstruction, it expresses that anyone who, “except in cases and under circumstances
expressly authorized by the Constitution of Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the
Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.”58 Basically, it
makes it illegal for the U.S. military to execute the laws of the U.S., specifically in the
performance of domestic civilian law enforcement functions.
However, this is not to imply in any way that the U.S. Government is powerless to
protect our national interests, especially when the DoD is under attack. 18 USC § 1386 is
significantly different from the aforementioned PCA in that it specifically addresses those
individuals who attempt to steal, purloin, embezzle, or obtain by false pretense any lock
or key to any lock knowing that such lock or key has been adopted by any part of the
Department of Defense. Barring future advents of USC specific to Cyberspace, this
“key” and its interpretation thereof, can be extended into the virtual realm as those
methods and procedures used to ensure DoD authentication, non-repudiation, and
encryption of our systems.
10 USC §2224, unlike the PCA, delineates to the Secretary of Defense specific
actions such as the establishment of the Defense Information Assurance Program. As
such, he is responsible to the National Command Authority for the “continuous
38

availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, non-repudiation, and rapid
restitution of information and information systems that are essential elements of the
Defense Information Structure.”59 However, these responsibilities are limited by 44 USC
§3541 which praises “commercially developed information security products” but
recognizes that “the selection of specific technical hardware and software information
security solutions should be left to individual agencies. . . .”60 While this represents the
crux of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, it also begs the
question, how is the OSD to ensure the integrity of information systems critical to the
DoD when agencies can self-determine their software and hardware configurations
independently? Additionally, 44 USC §3541 runs contrary to recent testimony given by
the director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who gave as his top
recommendation was a call for regulations and that the private sector “will never deliver
adequate security and the government must establish regulatory thresholds for critical
infrastructures.”61
International Policy on Cyberspace--United Nations Charter
Although there is a considerable body of international law that governs the use of
force in Cyberspace, technology does not allow a state to completely prevent
computer espionage or computer network attack, nor does it assure that a state can
reliably determine the identity of an intruder or attacker in any timely manner.62
Jus ad bellum, the law of conflict management or the Latin literal translation of
“Justice to War,” is a set of rules that govern the resorting to armed conflict and
determine whether said conflict is lawful or unlawful in its inception.63 Contemporary
recognition of a state‟s right to resort to war is captured in Article 2(4) of the Charter of
the United Nations. Written in 1945, well before the existence of a Cyberspace, this
39

article still has basis in today‟s cyber-conflicts as it redefines for us the principles of jus
as bellum. It states that:
All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations
from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state, or in a manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the
United Nations.64
Unfortunately, the charter neither defines what the threat of force or, more
importantly, what constitutes the use of force. Additionally, how does Cyberspace fit
into this equation? Assuming that China, or any state for that matter, would never lay
claim that neither Computer Network Defense (CND) nor Electronic Protection measures
(EP) are an act of aggression; we are left with CNE/ES and CNA/ECM.
With respect to both CNE and ES, we have international precedent from the
1950‟s through 70‟s where 22 military intelligence aircrafts were attacked by the formerSoviet Union. In 1960, the Soviet government asserted before a United Nations panel
that a specific U-2 flight by the U.S. over Soviet territory constituted an act of aggression.
The United Nations disagreed and concluded that while the U-2 flights violated Soviet
airspace, the act by itself did not constitute a use of force as dictated by Article 2(4).
Interesting point of fact, however, was that due to the political implications of a military
aircraft flying over sovereign USSR, military pilots were required to resign their
commissions before flying the CIA-owned platform65. This case established two
presidencies with regards to CNE and ES:
1. All nations are afforded reasonable self-defense response proportionate, if not in
kind, to the danger posed by the presence of the trespassing collection assets.
2. If the unlawful, physical penetration of a state‟s airspace by intelligence aircrafts
of another state‟s is not construed under the U.N. Charter as a use of force, then a
40

CNE and/or ES taken by one country against another also cannot be construed as
a use of force either.
Therefore, so long as the action taken by the victim state is meet principles of
proportionality with respect to the danger posed by the presence of the cyber-spy (using
ES/CNE methods), the victim state is acting well within the intent of U.S. Article 2(4).
Unfortunately, that begs the question, what is a proportionate response?

CHAPTER 3
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The methodology to assess these two nations will be to simply collect and analyze
the Cyberspace activities and capabilities between the two; then compare each nation
side-by-side and line-for-line, but quantitatively based on four criteria as follows:
1. Training: From a strictly academic position, compare and contrast the
education and training a PLA cyber-warrior receives as compared to a
U.S. Soldier. This will identify training gaps in the U.S. military
education system and possible advantages that we have over PLA forces.
2. Weapon systems: Beyond the rudimentary listing of advance computing
capabilities or routine hacker scripts, viruses, and DDoS-techniques used
in executing typical CNO, what specific cyber-systems do each country
posses that can deny, deceive, degrade, or disrupt operations in the cyberrealm with regards to both the means and the mediums through which
information is relayed. As this in an unclassified thesis, the U.S. counters
will merely list the system name with no description unless common
knowledge.
3. Planning: With regards to integration into the planning cycle, how does
China's Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW) either differ or
expound upon the U.S. Network Centric Warfare.
4. Full Spectrum Operations: From the perspective of the U.S. military, how
does the literature review from Chapter 2 map out along the U.S. Army‟s
view of Full Spectrum Operations (FSO)? What precursors to Chinese
45

PLA activities should we expect through both rhetoric and established
precedent?
Analysis of these four should answer my thesis of "to what extent the Chinese
cyber-warriors represent a viable threat to both the security and prosperity of our nation
as a whole," as well as "ascertain[ing] the U.S. Government‟s ability to defend and
enforce our national interests, both in regards to our own domestic infrastructures as well
as our partners abroad from Chinese-directed cyber-attacks"

46

CHAPTER 4
ANALYSIS
Once again, the purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent the Chinese
cyber-warriors represent a viable threat to both the security and prosperity of our nation
as a whole. Chapter 4 now takes the lessons from Chapter 2‟s Literature Review and
seeks to introduce an analytical perspective that will evaluate holistically:
1. How the PLA train their cyber warriors from an educational perspective
2. What cyber-weapons the PRC equips their on the battlefield to conduct
INEW
3. How the Chinese plan to incorporate their cyber-warriors in major combat
operations
4. How do Chinese view the domain of Cyberspace across the entire
spectrum of conflict
Training: U.S. vs. PLA Cyber-warrior
The PLA has spent the past several years pursuing a comprehensive build-up from
a mass army designed for a protracted war of attrition into one capable of fighting and
winning short duration, high-tech wars under “conditions of informatization (sic).” 1 As
noted in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, China has the “greatest potential to
compete militarily with the U.S. and field disruptive military technologies that could over
time offset traditional U.S. military advantages.” As mentioned earlier, the PLA‟s
current focus is on preparing for contingencies in the Taiwan Strait, thus supporting their
drive for modernization or in their own words informationalization. The scope of this

47

modernization has increased in recent years, signaled by the high rate of investment in
domestic defense supported by scientific and technological innovations.
On the training of these men and women, the responsibilities for offensive and
defensive cyber-warfare and their associated education and training are all shared by the
PLA, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Communications and the Propaganda
Department. In the PLA it appears that cyber-warfare is the primary responsibility of
General Staff Department Deputy Director General Chen Xiaogong, who oversees the
Third Department of the General Staff Department. As such, it is General Xiaogong‟s
responsibility for executing military cyber-warfare operations that incorporate electronic
warfare, and electronic and signals intelligence (ELINT) within not only the PLA, but
also the PLAN and PLAAF. The entire Third Department is led General Qui Ruilin, with
General Wu Guohua as his technical director. Deputy Directors include General Pan
Huizhong, who is also deputy director of the PLA's Central Communication University,
General Liu Xiaobei, an encryption specialist, Professor Yang Huida and Professor Liu
Meng. Finally, the Fifth Bureau is headed by Professor Yang Jingzong, who is a
specialist in communication security as well as information operations.
The training and development of the PLA cyber-warriors is predominantly
conducted at the Information Security University in which students are taught in the
practice of Information Security (IS) defense and attack techniques, as well as theory in
the military arena. Graduation enables the PLA cyber-warriors to work in national
defense and all military departments and levels.2 Of the academic curriculum that is to
follow,3 all is contained within the teaching plan for Military Information Security
Studies (MISS) for the PLA. For comparison, the Naval Postgraduate School was
48

selected, although any post-graduate service school would have produced equivalent
results.

It becomes readily apparent that while the PLA do receive advanced specialized
training in the areas of virus development and hacking techniques, their curriculum is
woefully insufficient when compared to that taught at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate
School (NPS) in nearly every category. Granted, the curriculum was laid out in 2002,
which explains the PLA‟s lack of wireless training, however at the time it met the PLA
short-term goal of establishing a common, full-time university supporting information
security at the undergraduate and professional level.4 One final note emphasizing the
focus of study, PLA‟s MISS program has 4 required courses on viruses and hacking
methods. This compared to the NPS‟s zero courses begs the question of relevance. It
should not be assumed that the PLA is developing better CNA warriors simply because
they received a series of virus scripting courses. On the contrary, with little to no

experience in code writing beyond the undergraduate exposure to coding principles, one
must question their hacking ability beyond that of a junior script-kiddie.
This in no way implies that the PLA would be ineffective in their application of
CNO on the battlefield. However, it does bring forth the question as to both the
adaptability and flexibility of the PLA cyberwarrior to the dynamic nature of real-life
combat operations against a very capable adversary such as the United States.
Weapons: U.S. vs. PLA Cyber-warrior
As discussed in Chapter 1, the PLA is actively pursuing an assassin‟s mace
weapon that when used will produce devastating results on the U.S. military‟s ability to
continue armed conflict. The application of this weapon system must be decisive in its
use of surprise and represents a revolution in military affairs. Listed below are the most
popular PLA weapon systems to date separated by the service most-likely to utilize
system.

Digitized Army Program: Inspired by the U.S.A. Future Combat
System (FCS) and established in 2001, currently limited to the
company and battalion levels; however, includes almost every
operational service of the PLA Ground to include Armor, Artillery,
the Airborne Corps and Special Operations Forces. Their specific
objective is to identify exploitable weaknesses that can be used
by conventional forces (PLA) against a digitized army (U.S.).
Each soldier can transfer real-time image and video battlefield
information to C2; each vehicle possesses independent
navigation/positioning, battlefield image capturing, target
acquisition, audio/image/data transmission, and laser warning and
defense.
Bodyguard Laser-Guided Weapon Countermeasures System:
Loaded in two cross-country trucks and two trailers, the Bodyguard
laser countermeasures system comprises five subsystems, including
Laser Warning Receivers (LWR), Active Laser Jamming (ALJ),
Passive Laser Jamming (PLJ), Central Display Control (CDC) and
Power Supply (PS). One system is capable of protecting an area of
6,000~16,000 square meters.
The Bodyguard system will be deployed near the target to be
protected. When enemy aircraft turns on its laser illuminating to aim
the targets, the laser warning receivers deployed around the target
will pick up the laser beam and inform the CDC unit. Within
seconds the PLJ will launch grenades to form a smoke obstacle over
the protected target to block the enemy's laser illuminating. At the
same time the ALJ unit will launch similar laser beam to the fake
targets some distance away from the protected targets. The fake
targets reflects the laser signal back to the enemy‟s laser guided
weapon to misguide it so that it will hit the fake target rather than
the real one.
Regional Integrated Electronic System ("Qu Dian") - Project
995: The PLA began to construct a theatre-level command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, targetacquisition, reconnaissance (C4ISTAR) network at its southeast
coast region in the 1990s. This network, known as Regional
Integrated Electronic System (Qu Dian), is an automated battle
management system that can support joint operations with combined
ground, naval, and air forces.

ELINT (1-18Ghz)

Prophet System

The centre of the “Qu Dian” system is a dedicated military
communications satellite codenamed FengHuo-1 (FH-1) first
launched in January 2000. The Pentagon described that system as "a
secure, jam-resistant, high capacity data link communications
system for use in a tactical combat." It was China‟s first space-based
communication platform to provide military units with both C-band
and UHF communications. The “Qu Dian” system allows theatre
commanders to communicate with and share data with all forces
under joint command.
The current “Qu Dian” system in southeast China mainly focuses on
a possible conflict with Taiwan. The system covers military units
within Nanjing and Guangzhou (Fig. 1) military regions. The system
includes a theatre joint operation C4I centre (JOC), which is capable
of rapidly passing operational orders down the chain of command
and moving information to national and theatre level decision
makers. The theatre JOC has direct communication links with C4I
centers of Nanjing Military Region (MR), Nanjing Military Region
Air Force (MRAF), Guangzhou MR, Guangzhou MRAF, Navy
Headquarters, East Sea Fleet, maritime task forces and a submarine
intelligence centre.
The “Qu Dian” system enables theatre commanders to create an
integrated battlefield picture, centralizing data from ground, air,
naval and space-based platforms for wide dissemination to
subordinate units. The system controls a large number of platforms
including imagery and radar reconnaissance satellites, airborne early
warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, electronic intelligence
(ELINT) aircraft, electronic warfare aircraft, ELINT ships, landbased observation stations, land-based electronic warfare &
countermeasure (EW/ELINT) units, etc.
DZ9001 Mobile Electronic Intelligence System: The DZ9001 is a
mobile electronic intelligence (ELINT) system designed to detect,
intercept, analyze, identify and record the enemy radar radiation. By
collecting and analyzing the signals of enemy radar, their technical
parameters and operation modes can be acquired and recorded for
both defensive and offensive electronic countermeasures operations
such as suppression of air defense (SEAD).
The DZ9001 system is composed of 1~8 GHz low-band system,
8~18GHz high-band system and power supply. The high- and lowband systems can operate separately or in together.
The system was developed by Jiangnan Electronic &
Communications Research Institute (JECOR, also known as 36
Institute) of Jiangxing, Zhejiang Province. The development began
in 1984 and the system entered the PLA service in the late 1980s
JN1105A Communications Jammer: The JN1105A is a mobile
communication countermeasures system designed to locate and jam
54

enemy tactical radio communication signals. The system was
developed by 36 Institute (now Jiangnan Electronic &
Communications Research Institute, JECOR) of Jiangxing, Zhejiang
Province in 1982. The JN1105A took part in the 1980s ChinaVietnam border conflict and played important roles in the electronic
warfare to suppress Vietnamese Army command & control and
communications networks.
The system can cover the communication frequencies of HF
(1.6~30MHz), VHF (30~100MHz), and UHF (100~500MHz). The
whole system is carried on a vehicle, but can also be dissembled and
carried by several soldiers on specially-designed racks to reach
remote areas in mountain and highland
JN1601 Communications Jammer: The JN1601 is an integrated
communication countermeasures system designed to search,
intercept, monitor, analyze, and jam enemy high-frequency (HF)
communication signals. The system can be used as a stand-along
system or integrated into other communication countermeasures
system. If necessary, the system can also be used for conventional
communication purpose. The system is also used for communication
and electronic warfare training.

NRJ5 Ship-Based Electronic Warfare System: The NRJ5 is a
shipborne electronic warfare (EW) suite designed to provide radar
and laser warning, as well as to employ electronic/laser
countermeasures to neutralize enemy threats. The system provides
the capability of surveillance, radar/laser warning, passive and active
jamming against various anti-ship weapons.
Being modular in design, the NRJ5 system can be easily tailored
into different function units to optimize EW capabilities for different
classes of naval vessels. The system can be either used as a standalong EW module, or integrated into the Combat Information Centre
(CIC) and other onboard systems to form a complete command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (C4ISR) system.
Seawatch Shipborne Electronic Countermeasures System:
Seawatch is a shipborne electronic and electro-optical
countermeasures system designed to provide both passive and active
defense against guided weapons (radar-, IR-, TV-, and laserguidance). The system can be installed on a variety of surface
combatant ships from 200 to 4,000 tons.
When a hostile laser threat signal is detected by the system‟s optical
sensors, Seawatch gives out warnings, and trigger smoke grenade
launchers to generate a smoke screen to protect the carrier ship.
If the system receives hostile radar signals through its radar warning
55

Aegis and SPY-1

receivers (RWR), Seawatch system can calculate the best launching
parameters for the onboard air-defense or anti-missile weapons, and
the best maneuver direction for the carrier ship, based on the threat
signal, current sailing data, and meteorological information
HZ100 Shipborne ECM/ELINT System:
The HZ-100 is a shipborne ECM/ELINT system to detect, intercept,
analyze and identify the electromagnetic emissions of hostile radar
from the sea, shore, and air to acquire information on those radar
related weapon systems, providing the carrier ship with the basic
intelligence for electronic warfare reactions. The system covers the
signal frequency of 2~18 GHz

ground-based intercept and jamming control subsystem.
KG300G Airborne Self-Defense Jammer Pod:
The KG300G is an airborne self-defense jammer pod developed by
China Electronic Technology Corporation (CETC). The system was
EA-6B (Navy)
designed to be carried by combat aircraft on their external stores
stations to perform jamming in I-/J-band against hostile airborne or
EB-52H (cancelled)
land-based weapon radar. The pod-contained KG300G is much
smaller and more flexible than the internally installed jammer, but
with similar performance.

U.S. Air Force

As indicated in Figure 4, each U.S. branch has their own respective either equivalent or
counter-PLA system in the realm of EW. Although not overtly discussed in historical
PLA military exercises along their multiple military regions (Figure 1), one can assume
that conducting operations in a complex military environment implies frequency
deconfliction to minimize fratricide amongst PLA units.

56

Planning: U.S. vs. PLA Cyber-warrior
In 2002, Major General Dai Qingmin (discussed in chapters 2-1.b and 2-1.c), the
then-Director of the 4th Department of the General Staff Department, published his
Wang Dian Yiti Zhan (Introduction to Integrated Network-Electronic Warfare) and his
book Direct Information Warfare. With Dai‟s theories on Battlefield Information
Environment (BIE) presented in 1999 as well as Colonels Qiao Liang and Wang
Ziangsui‟s Unrestricted Warfare, how does the PLA‟s plan to implement cyberspace in
order to compensate for their military inferiority compete with the U.S. execution of Network
Centric Warfare?
Dai presented several interesting arguments in support of Integrated NetworkElectronic Warfare (INEW). First, he dissected the two emphasizing that EW‟s objectives
are the disruption of an opponent‟s acquisition and forwarding of information; while
computer network warfare‟s objectives are to disrupt the opponent‟s processing and use of
information.6 However, in bringing the two back together, several of Dai‟s INEW
characteristics, while sound in their theoretical application in a combat environment, one
finds an equal number of weak arguments as indicated in the following chart:

57

Unsound or unrealistic practices

Sound or supported characteristics

PLA‟s Major General Dai Qingmin‟s characteristics of INEW7
Dai on Battlespace: Anywhere networks
and electromagnetic waves reach can
possibly be the site of an information
operations attack; thus, INEW will take
place in a combat operations space much
larger than any current form of combat.
SOUND: Echoes Unrestricted Warfare in
its sentiment for breaking through the
traditional boundaries of military, transmilitary, and non-military warfare; for
example, space, economic, and electronic
warfare; all of which are viable and well
recognized targets of U.S. national power.
Dai on Combat Methods: INEW must be
coordinated as one in terms of targets for
attack and combat opportunities. The
integrated plan must reflect in full the basic
trend of development and the rules of
action. However, also in 2002 Dai stressed
the “plebification” trend, emphasizing that
the populace can now participate in network
warfare far from the front lines.8
FLAWED: Dai is quite unrealistic and
somewhat irresponsible in suggesting the
public become involved in national affair,
and at minimum involved in direct support
of military combatants. Even so, his two
statements are contradictory without an
established means to control Chinese
nationalists as he does not provide insight
on the handling of rogue citizens.

Dai on Effectiveness: INEW takes as its main
targets of attack the normal operation of the
information system in the enemy‟s political, military,
economic, and social systems. Therefore, combat
effect resulting from INEW is greater than that of
any single form of traditional combat operations.
SOUND: Again, echoes Unrestricted Warfare,
however, now Dai hits on virtually the same
construct used by the U.S. military to define a state‟s
key strengths and weaknesses and describe the
operational environment: PMESII, or Political,
Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure, and
Information
Dai on Combat Objectives: Information systems
with their computer networks have become the
lifeblood of nations‟ economies and their armed
forces. If these networks become paralyzed, a
nation‟s entire security faces a serious threat.
Therefore, as soon as this lifeblood is attacked, the
combat power of the armed force will be degraded,
or even completely lost.
FLAWED: INEW‟s success directly depends on an
adversary‟s complete reliance of their C4ISR in order
to conduct any effect military operation. For the U.S.
we must be completely dependent on the Global
Information Grid and NCW in order for INEW to
have the impact he expects. Dai assumes too much
as the U.S. has historically dominated the battlespace
without the assistance of NCW with the only
exception being the most-recent conflict.

Figure 5. Dai Qingmin on Integrated Network-Electronic Warfare (INEW)

The military academic theories of Dai, however, seem to have made the way of
other armchair generals focused on fighting the last war, and despite his assertions in
support of INEW, his theories are not well demonstrated in current PLA training.
Throughout the literature review in support of Chapter 2, the repeated sentiment was that
while theory is respected, the PLA trains their forces exactly as they intend to fight. As
such, PLA military activities in February 2009 would be a good indicator for how one
should expect the Chinese to employ their cyber-warriors in a more-current conflict. For

58

example, in the Beijing MR (Figure 1), the Special Merit 5th Company has developed a
system of training infantry units under complex electromagnetic settings. The 5th
Company confronted 9 other companies in rotation; each equipped with significantly
stronger, high-tech EA and ISR capabilities. Despite their technological shortcomings,
they were ultimately able to work out winning strategies by exploiting their existing
transceivers for use in different settings. What is important to note is not the specific
technique they used, but rather the fact that the communication units of the PLA ground
forces are focusing on proactively testing and improving their combat methods in a
variety of realistic confrontations.9 Not attempting to “capture . . . information
supremacy in [both] electromagnetic and network space”10 as Major General Qingmin
would have wanted. In fact, if one assumes that the training methodology used by the
PLA is a direct indication of their tactics, techniques, and procedures that will be used in
combat, then the Chinese will likely mimic the U.S. network-centric warfare. The
literature indicates that the PLA seek to develop a competitive warfighting advantage
through the development of well-networked, dispersed forces capable of ensuring
continued operations.
Full Spectrum Operations: U.S. vs. PLA Cyber-Warrior
The PLA seek to incorporate both lethal and non-lethal skills if and when they
become involved in conflict. Assuming that their training conducted across military
regions (Figure 1) over the past 10 years represents the actions that we should expect they
would take when exposed to similar operational environment and involved in actual
combat what actions would separate their operational themes, and what would their FSOs
look like? For Cyberspace, the PLA have demonstrated a very complex and vibrant
59

spectrum of operations through which they maintain control. As such, figures 3 and 4
both seek to address the PLA‟s operational themes in a full spectrum operations
environment.
In Peacetime Military Engagements the PLA will likely have as its only offensive
element more non-discriminatory CNE operations as discussed in 2.2a. Space operations
and EW, however, will continue to support ASAT testing (from 2.2c) but only on
Chinese space assets and EW jamming within the 7 MRs (Figure 1) and from naval
assets. From a defensive standpoint, the PLA will establish and demonstrate the use of
EWP in their military exercises while their CND will continue identifying and securing
critical PLA assets across the Chinese global information grid (GIG). Finally, for
stability operations, the PLA will continue to pursue non-U.S. global positioning-type
satellite systems and deter reliance on the U.S.-led system for fear of selected availability.
Operating in the spectrum of Limited Intervention, PLA will enhance their CNE
capabilities offensively to include limited CNA as required to test U.S. system defenses
for possible future exploitation. In space operations, the PLA will increase employment
of directed energy on U.S. IMINT collection platforms.

CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In an effort to establish an answer to the research statement of determining to
what extent the PLA cyber-warriors along with both state and non-state sponsored
hackers represent a viable threat to the security and prosperity of our nation as a whole,
this chapter will extract the reviews from chapter 2 along with the analysis and
conclusions drawn from chapter 4.
In chapter 2, the analysis drew from both Chinese and U.S. literature in an effort
to understand the totality of Cyberspace as viewed by both nations. Each country
represented their own interpretation with respect to that which the PLA cyber-warriors
are capable of accomplishing. From the Chinese perspective, chapter 2 first introduced
the difficulties associated with embracing literature generated through the PLA
publishing and media systems as they relate to propaganda. However, certain gems, such
as Unrestricted Warfare, give us unique insight into the PRC and their views on how best
to implement cyber-warriors and Chinese nationals. As such, we can conclude that in no
uncertain terms, the Chinese fully intend to use completely unconventional methods of
warfare that extend beyond exploiting traditional CNO-EW and space assets. Chapter 2
continues by introducing the PLA practices of counter-reconnaissance as well as theories
which include integrating a civil-military aspect in CNO (the hacktivists). On EW,
research and development beyond traditional communications and satellite jamming
parameters is certainly on the PLA‟s forefront. Finally, Chinese literature responded to
the accusations of the GhostNet as anticipated, by pointing back at western nations for

58

manufacturing the situation. However, it is the depth of GhostNet‟s penetration into our
civil and economic infrastructures that is most worrisome.
The U.S.‟s perspective of China follows in Chapter 2 with a strong reminder of
the Chinese historical trends of preemptive use of force. Their history, along with
rhetoric implying the PLA considering CNO as a first-strike option leaves one to assert
that the Chinese are pursuing their asymmetric advantage in CNO. On seizing
electromagnetic dominance, the U.S. clearly recognizes the Chinese efforts to emphasize
their technological base in C4ISR. Finally, on the significant advances in counter space
assets, the January 2007 ASAT is only one of several assassin‟s mace that the Chinese
would like to develop more of.
Unfortunately, legal analysis both into domestic and international cyber-law leave
the U.S. military in a dilemma that has yet to be solved. The Comprehensive National
Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) is still under its 60-day review, and as of this thesis it has
yet to identify a clear solution. Guiding principles gleaned from U.S. Code lack the
necessary clarification and are contradictory at best. Internationally, we depend upon
United Nations Charters generated over 60 years ago which leaves the United States with
the vague option of a thus far undefined proportionality against a CNE.
The chapter on Analysis introduces 4 perspectives that were used to evaluate the
extent to which Chinese cyber-warriors represent a viable threat to our nation. First,
through the assistance of research from the Virtual Dragon, and a cross-comparison with
the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, it became readily apparent that the PLA CNO
academic curriculum is woefully insufficient and severely lacks training especially in a
variety of necessary computing languages. Unfortunately, as the only PLA Military
59

Information Security Studies curriculum was from 2002, at this time, there is no way to
confirm that the coursework has not expanded to either mimic U.S. training, or build to a
level beyond our own.
The second perspective seeks to analyze both the equipment capabilities and our
equivalent systems. This list is limited in its applicability as there is neither a listing to
indicate the number of actual systems in the PLA inventory, nor the relative experience in
each system. Throughout the literature review there are references to actual military
exercises incorporating the PLA operating in a complex electro-magnetic environment.
However, rarely will periodicals such as PLA Daily list the specific system by name.
One critical gem from all this: first the PLA has implemented an FCS-type program with
the sole objective of identifying exploitable weaknesses in U.S. systems. As such, we
can expect future combat to be extremely FCS-unfriendly.
The third analysis sought to extract the PLA planning and implementation
procedures for the Chinese cyber-warriors. To do this, Major General Dai Qingmin‟s
works were dissected starting from his Battlefield Information Environment in 1999 to an
interview several years later. Two critical holes in his theory are discussed implying that
his INEW theories will remain exactly that: a theory. Chinese military exercises from
2000 till February 2009 only discuss informationalization along with the modernization
of their force. Terms implying a counter-Network Centric Warfare model such as INEW
are reserved for academia.
Finally, the fourth analysis takes the highpoints from the thesis to generate a Full
Spectrum Operations (FSO) graphic depicting likely PLA actions along the spectrum of

60

conflict. The main focus of which is the CNO capabilities but space and EW are viable
options as well.
In conclusion, in determining to what extent the PLA cyber-warriors represent a
viable threat to the security and prosperity of our nation, the answer most certainly is
“yes.” With that in mind one must surmise from this thesis that the threat is currently
limited in nature, but highly demonstrative in potential. For example--despite the fact
that the PLA cyber-warriors are at best script-kiddies when it comes to CNO, immature
and non-expeditionary when it comes to EW, and neutralized of their asymmetric
advantage by our 2008 ASAT demonstration--they have demonstrated exponential
growth and development since the publishing of Unrestricted Warfare in their MR
exercises. Their theories and application of military theory mimics our own to a great
extent, however a coordinated INEW assault is unlikely considering their lack of CNO
training.

Recommendations for future research are as follows:
1. Further research on the PLA EW systems above the unclassified level.
For example, specifically how do the jamming capabilities of the PLA
systems compare with the U.S. military‟s?
2. Current training pipeline and operational employment of the PLA CNO
units throughout the MR. For example, are the PLA cyber-warriors
simply system administrators or capable combat multipliers?
3. What is the Chinese legal precedent on cyberspace defining their use of
force? Additionally, what is the specific legal protocol China uses in
61

dealing with hacktivists? Is there a clearly defined C2 structure through
which the PRC is able to task Chinese nationals? What are the exploitable
vulnerabilities in said structure?

DDoS. Distributed Denial of Service. Is an attempt to make a computer resource
unavailable to its intended users. One common method of attack involves
saturating the target (victim) machine with external communications requests,
such that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be
rendered effectively unavailable. In general terms, DDoS attacks are implemented
by either forcing the targeted computer(s) to reset, or consuming its resources so
that it can no longer provide its intended service or obstructing the

INEW Integrated Network Electronic Warfare. According to Dai Qingmin, refers to a
series of combat operations that use the integration of electronic warfare and
computer network warfare measures to disrupt the normal operation of enemy
battlefield information systems while protecting one's own, with the objective of
seizing information superiority--similar to the U.S. definition of IO.
People‟s Liberation Army (PLA). For the purposes of this thesis, the term 'People's
Liberation Army' implies the land, naval, and air military services (unless
otherwise specified, for example: PLAN or PLAAF). This includes the police,

Army‟s keystone doctrine for training. It addresses the fundamentals of training modular,
expeditionary Army forces to conduct full spectrum operations (FSO)--simultaneous
offensive, defensive, and stability or civil support operations--in an era of persistent
conflict.
-Paraphrased from FM 7-0, page iii, 12 December 2008
