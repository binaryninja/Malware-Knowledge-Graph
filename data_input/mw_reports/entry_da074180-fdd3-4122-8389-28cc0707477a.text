Research by: Amit Serper

Introduction
Cybereason Nocturnus is investigating a campaign where attackers are trojanizing multiple
hacking tools with njRat, a well known RAT. The campaign ultimately gives attackers total access
to the target machine. The threat actors behind this campaign are posting malware embedded
inside various hacking tools and cracks for those tools on several websites. Once the ﬁles are
downloaded and opened, the attackers are able to completely take over the victim’s machine. In
this write-up we present our analysis of the TTPs of the attackers and the indicators of
compromise. In the investigation of this campaign, we have found hundreds of trojanized ﬁles and
a lot of information about the threat actors infrastructure.
Learn more about what trends we expect to see this year in our 2020 security predictions
report.

Key Points
Widespread Campaign: We have found a widespread hacking campaign that uses the
njRat trojan to hijack the victim’s machine, giving the threat actors complete access that
can be used for anything from conducting DDoS attacks to stealing sensitive data.
Baiting Hackers: The malware is spreading by turning various hacking tools and other
installers into trojans. The threat actors are posting the maliciously modiﬁed ﬁles on various
forums and websites to bait other hackers.
Using Vulnerable WordPress Websites: The threat actors are hacking vulnerable
WordPress installations to host their malicious njRat payloads.
A “Malware Factory”: It seems as if the threat actors behind this campaign are building
new iterations of their hacking tools on a daily basis.

Malware analysis
While reviewing some detection data last week, we stumbled on a new detection of njRat in one
of the environments we are monitoring. njRat is popular in the Middle East and gives its operators
the ability to hijack the victim’s machine for keylogging, taking screenshots, ﬁle manipulation and
exﬁltration, webcam and microphone recording.
While njRat is a fairly prevalent threat and popular RAT, this particular infection caught our eye.

Initial detection of the njRat in the Cybereason Defense Platform.
The process appears to be masquerading as a legitimate Windows application (explorer.exe).
However, when checking its hash on VirusTotal, the sample seems to be very new, just a few
hours old at the time. In the affected environment, it looks as if the njRat is contacting two IP
addresses: one of them was unknown to us at the time (capeturk.com - more on that later) and
the other, (anandpen.com) a compromised website of an Indian ofﬁce supplies manufacturer.

anandpen.com is a hacked WordPress website that serves malware from one of its internal
WordPress directories. This is a common practice by attackers who are exploiting vulnerable
WordPress installations. In this case, one of the payloads was served through the /wpincludes/images/media/1/explorer.zip path on the anandpen.com domain.
After running a few YARA queries and searching for all of the samples on VT associated with the
two aforementioned IP addresses, we found dozens of different samples of the same njRat
hosted on the same server. Each sample had a different creation time, but they were all hosted
on the same server and actively targeting victims.
As mentioned before, all of the observed samples (including the detection on one of the
environments we are monitoring) had the name of a legitimate Windows process, like svchost.exe
or explorer.exe, yet all of them were executed from subdirectories inside %AppData%. Clearly,
some mischief was taking place, but the root cause for these executions was unknown since the
ﬁles were dropped in the environment prior to the deployment of our product.

Finding the Root Cause
When investigating the Malop, it’s clear the malicious explorer.exe process is communicating with
the hostname 7777.elitﬁlmizle[.]com.

The information ﬁelds in the unsigned PE ﬁle have an interesting peculiarity to them:

Highlighted are the company name and product name of the ﬁle, as seen in the Cybereason
Defense Platform.
Further inspection of the ﬁle version information reveals more mismatches:

For comparison, here’s the product information ﬁeld for a legitimate signed explorer.exe from a
Windows 10 Pro build 1903:

Legitimate explorer.exe hash: 4E196CEA0C9C46A7D656C67E52E8C7C7.
While the ﬁle name is explorer.exe, the company name is “Intel Corporation” and the product
name is “Intel(R) Common Users Interface”, which certainly doesn’t make much sense.
Some more hints (notice the date) are in the PDB path for said ﬁle:

There are a few interesting details in this PDB path:
1. “03-02-2020” - this date implies there are multiple different variants of the same project
(past/future versions.Upon further investigation, I found many of these variants.
2. “TripleDES-Rijn-GZIPP” - this refers to methods the loader of the malware uses to
masquerade it’s true purpose (more on that later)
When examining explorer.exe, it’s clear that it is actually a .NET PE executable:

Upon closer inspection, this ﬁle was originally written in Visual Basic, which is typical for njRat
loaders:

Some of the crypter functionality is available once the executable is decompiled (note that the
decomplication is to C# for legibility):

The three red arrows in the screenshot are directly related to the string I mentioned before, which
appeared in the PDB (“TripleDES-Rijn-GZIPP”). The arrows point to the method of encryption and
compression (one can say obfuscation) of the ﬁle: TripleDES followed by AES (Rijndael) and then
GZIP compression. The blue arrows point to the key used for both the TripleDES and AES
encryption, which is “abc123456”.
Once the loader unpacks the payload, it deletes the original loader ﬁle and continues to run its
course. The malware will create a new directory, %USER%\AppData\Roaming\Intel
Corporation\Intel(R) Common User Interface\8.1.1.7800\ and use it as a staging directory. The
njRat loader continues to drop ﬁles into that staging directory, eventually dropping the main njRat
payload with a random name. The malware changes the random ﬁle name to explorer.exe, copies
it to %AppData%\roaming, and executes it from there. After it executes, the fake explorer.exe (the
njRat payload) runs a netsh command to communicate to the outside world. It alters the
Windows Firewall with the following command:

njRat contacts several servers to receive commands and ﬁles from its operators:
Capeturk.com - a repository for a newer version of njRat used in this campaign
Blog.capeturk.com - the C2 for njRat
Anandpen.com - the repository for various njRat versions and other tools used by the
attackers
Note: anandpen.com was hacked by the attackers. It is a WordPress-powered website of a
pen manufacturing company from India. We have reached out to the company and
informed them about the incident, but we have yet to receive a response.

Threat Intel
Now that we understand how this njRat campaign operates and which servers it’s connecting to,
there is one question that remains: how do people get infected?
After examining the environment, it’s clear there were many hacking and penetration tools
deployed in various paths on the target machine. By examining the hashes on the network, we
could see that all of the hacking tools had various cracks deployed alongside them. Both the tools
and the cracks were all infected with this njRat campaign.
By correlating the identiﬁed servers with the hashes found on VT using VTGraph, we can see
there are plenty of samples related to this campaign:

VTGraph correlating between samples and servers.
At this point, we know there is a campaign targeting hackers by trojanizing various hacking tools.
The one question that remains is, “where are all of these trojanized tools coming from?”
One of the ﬁles on the system was a keygen for an SQLi Dumper. SQLi Dumper is a tool used to
perform all kinds of SQL injections and data dumps.

One of the infected keygens for the program SQLi dumper v8.2.
As we can see in the screenshot below, the keygen is credited to [RTN]. RTN is a group that
writes cracks to various programs. They have a website and a forum:

Screenshot from RTN’s website.
Important note: RTN’s forum was inaccessible as of writing this report - we cannot determine if
the trojanized ﬁles have anything to do with the original creators of the keygens made by RTN.
However, the mediaﬁre ﬁle hosting website contains the trojanized ﬁle and many other cracked
versions of tools:

When looking for the page that leads to this ﬁle share, a blog hosted on Blogspot was found
which offers many cracked hacking and the aforementioned trojanized tools, linking to the above
mentioned MediaFire ﬁle share:

As mentioned above, this campaign appears to have been going on for several years. So far, we
have found samples that are either pretending to be various hacking tools or pretending to be
installers of the Chrome Internet browser. There are around 700 samples associated with the
*.capeturk.com subdomain, and there are more samples added to various threat intelligence
resources on a daily basis.

PDB Artifacts
As described in the malware analysis section of this writeup, it appears that the PDB path
embedded in the malware samples contains valuable information on how the malware is packed,
as can be seen in the following examples. Each example is taken from a different sample:
1. C:\Users\pc\Desktop\25-8-2019\3 lop-GZip+poly Xor base64\GZip+poly Xor base64

These are just four examples out of hundreds of ﬁles. It’s worth noting that each example has
different dates. Some are very recent, while others are from a few years ago. This suggests that
compilation of these malicious ﬁles is automated.

The Domain
Until June 2018, it seems capeturk.com was a Turkish gaming website dedicated to the wellknown game Minecraft. On November 25 2018, the capeturk.com domain expired and was
registered by a Vietnamese individual. The domain started to be associated with malware around
the time of the re-registration, however, it is unclear whether this Vietnamese individual has any
ties to the malware campaign. That being said, it seems someone from Vietnam is constantly
testing the samples by submitting them to VirusTotal. We suspect this individual is tied to the
Vietnamese domain ownership:

VirusTotal submissions page from one of the samples.
Important note: According to the highlighted path from the submission information and
the win7x64 username in the path, this is some sort of test machine. Additionally, this
sample was submitted from Vietnam.

Multiple campaigns and targets?
After examining different samples submitted to different subdomains of capeturk.com (as detailed
in the IOCs section of this writeup) it appears that each subdomain is targeting different software
and therefore a different set of victims. While all of the samples associated with
blog.capeturk.com are targeting various penetration testing and hacking tools, other subdomains
are targeting Chrome installers, native Windows applications, and other random programs that
have nothing to do with hacking or penetration testing.
For example, this sample which is connecting to 6666.elitﬁlmizle.com, is another njRat payload
pretending to be an NVIDIA service:

Another important behavior to note is that the numbers in the subdomain (6666, 7777, etc)
correspond to the port on which the C2 server is running on the host. For example,
6666.elitﬁlmizle.com has port 6666 listening on it, 7777.elitﬁlmizle.com has port 7777, and so on.

Conclusion
This investigation surfaced almost 1000 njRat samples compiled and built on almost a daily basis.
It is safe to assume that many individuals have been infected by this campaign (although at the
moment we are unable to know exactly how many). This campaign ultimately gives threat actors
complete access to the target machine, so they can use it for anything from conducting DDoS
attacks to stealing sensitive data off the machine.
It is clear the threat actors behind this campaign are using multiple servers, some of which appear
to be hacked WordPress blogs. Others appear to be the infrastructure owned by the threat group,
judging by multiple hostnames, DNS data, etc.
At the moment, we are unable to ascertain the other victims this malware campaign is targeting,
other than those targeted by the trojanized hacking tools connecting to the “7777 server”. We will
continue to monitor this campaign for any further developments.
