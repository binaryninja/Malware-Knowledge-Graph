18 octobre 2022

Context
During 2022, a company discovered that one of their equipments was communicating with a
known command and control server. As a result, the company decided to contact CERT
Intrinsec in order to get help to handle the security breach and manage the crisis. CERT
Intrinsec gathered information about malicious activities that were discovered on victim’s
information system, and past incidents. Our in-depth analysis led us to conclude that an
advanced persistent threat dubbed APT27 (a.k.a LuckyMouse, EmissaryPanda) actually
compromised the company’s internal network by exploiting a public facing application. Our
analysis showed that the threat actor managed to compromise several different domains and
to gain persistence on many equipments while trying to hide in plain sight. As investigations
went on, we observed tactics, techniques and procedures that had already been
documented in papers, but we discovered new ones as well. CERT Intrinsec wanted to share
with the community fresh and actionnable threat-intelligence related to APT27. That is why
this report presents a timeline of actions taken by the attackers and the tactics, techniques
and procedures seen during our incident response. It provides as well a MITRE ATT&CK
diagram and several recommendations to follow if you came across such incident, and to
prevent them.

CERT Intrinsec presentation
CERT Intrinsec is a private French incident response team dealing between 50 to 100 major
incidents per year and works to help its customers to recover from cyber-attacks and
strengthen their security. Since 2017, CERT Intrinsec has responded to hundreds of security
breaches involving companies and public entities. The majority of those incidents are related
to cybercriminality and ransomware attacks with financial objectives, hence, Intrinsec follows
those groups activities and generates comprehensive intelligence `from the field`. ANSSI
(French National Security Agency) granted CERT Intrinsec PRIS (State-Certified Security
Incident Response Service Providers) certification. The latter testify that CERT Intrinsec
meets specific incident response requirements, using dedicated procedures, qualified people
and appropriate infrastructures. Should you need our expertises, Intrinsec provides Incident
response & Crisis services, Threat Intelligence services & datas, Detection services

APT27 Presentation
APT27 (a.k.a LuckyMouse, EmissaryPanda, Iron Tiger or Mustang Panda) is a supposed
nation state cyber threat actor linked to RPC governement. Since at least 2010, the group
has been reported targeting numerous public organisations as well as private companies.
Known APT27 sectors of interest are: Defense contractors, Aerospace, Telecommunication,
Energy, Manufacturing, Technology, Education and finally governement’s data (ambassies
has been reported targeted). The group is also well known for exploiting internet facing
applications to get access within the victim’s networks. Known targeted application were
MySQL, Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604 RCE), Apache Zookeeper and more recently
Microsoft Exchange servers. In addition, the group is also known to rely on the HyperBRO
malware, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Capabilities description and decryption tool are
available on behalf of the report.

Operation’s timeline
It is important to look at the timeline of malicious activities. The first activity discovered was
the exploitation of a Microsoft Exchange server using ProxyLogon vulnerabilities chain and
the domains discovery performed from this server. APT27’s operators then compromised
several domains in a few months, dumping credentials and gathering technical data about
victim’s information system. Finally, they started exfiltrating data in archives using different
means. Gigabytes of data were exfiltrated in 17 days. Attackers tried to hide their activities
using many defense evasion techniques that we present to you in this report.
The following timeline shows the different steps of the operation, especially regarding
domains compromise and data exfiltration.

T1190

Exploit Public-Facing Application

Initial compromise is the adversaries actions performed to gain access of their target’s
organisations. It can be performed by sending spear-phishing email or exploiting vulnerable
internet facing applications to, then, move within the network. During CERT Intrinsec
investigations, we found that on March, 4th of 2021, APT27 exploited ProxyLogon
vulnerabilities chain affecting Microsoft Exchange server to gain initial access of the targeted
organisation’s network. As a reminder, ProxyLogon related Microsoft advisory was initially
published by Microsoft on March, 2th of 2021. First known information related to those CVE
came back from december 2020, when DEVCORE Team discovered both CVE-2021-26855
and CVE-2021-27065. The exploitation of these two vulnerabilities leads to remote code
execution with SYSTEM permissions, allowing attackers to drop webshells, for instance.

4/17

Same initial intrusion date, also involving a successful ProxyShell exploitation as entry vector
has been also reported by HVS-Consulting for one of their customer in their incident
response report related to APT27. Many others security vendors also reported active
exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server on that date. We can assume that the threat group
was aware of the vulnerability before the Microsoft Advisory (or quickly developped an
exploit) and managed to perform a massive exploitation campaign before companies had a
chance to apply security fixes.

Windows Management Instrumentation

Adversaries were wrapping their commands through calls to cmd.exe /Q /c command line. In
addition, all results were stored int the ADMIN$ administrative share, in a file of type
__[UNIX_EPOCH_DATETIME]
This a likely the impacket’s behaviour and hence, Intrinsec CERT assumes that adversaries
used that framework during their operation.
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe(cmd.exe /Q /c powershell Add-MpPreference ExclusionPath C:\Windows\temp 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[UNIX_EPOCH_DATETIME]
2>&1)
In order to execute remote command, threat actors also relied on valid credentials collected
in previous stages used wmic tool to execute commands on remote hosts.
As exemple, a command where attackers executed a script located in the recycle bin of a
remote computer:
cmd.exe /Q /c wmic /node:[IP] /user:[DOMAIN]\[ACCOUNT] /password:[PASSWORD]
process call create cmd /c d:\$recycle.bin\2.bat

Typical next step after a successful initial intrusion is to ensure persistance within the target’s
network and be sure that attacker’s will not be kick-out easily.
It is commonly achieved by deploying webshells, Remote Access Trojan or Remote
Administration Tool, such as AnyDesk / Teamviewer.
First payload found by CERT Intrinsec was the HyperBRO Remote Access Trojan.
HyperBRO malware is a closed-sources application typical of APT27 threat group’s activities.
HyperBRO is a fully featured Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and is used by APT27 operators
to (not exaustive):
Bypass UAC
Execute local & remote commands
Steal data
Keylogging
Capture keyboard
Edit registry
Manage files, process, services

HyperBRO Malware description
HyperBro is a custom in-memory RAT backdoor used by APT27 and associated groups
(Emissary Panda, Iron Tiger, LuckyMouse…)
Once the HyperBro virus has infected a host, it’s used by APT27 to execute remote
commands from it’s C2 server. HyperBro also includes features for taking screenshots,
stealing clipboard content, modifying Windows services, editing the registry, and
manipulating files (downloading and uploading, deleting, renaming).

Deployment
First, a legitimate program (linked to CyberArk software) (vfhost.exe / msmpeng.exe) with a
DLL side-loading vulnerability is used to load vftrace.dll (Initial loader / Stage 1).
Then the loader will be able to decrypt thumb.dat (Stage 2) file, “encrypted” with a 1 byte key
algorithm, decompress it and finaly extract the actual HyperBro backdoor (Stage
3) (compressed with lznt1 algorithm).
The loader will then use the process hollowing technique to inject HyperBro backdoor
(Stage 3)
The HyperBro backdoor configuration is embedded into its own PE. At its first execution, the
configuration is copied into the config.ini file and into the config_ registry key.

HyperBRO Extractor

7/17

CERT Intrinsec made a tool to extract HyperBro configuration from Stage 2 samples.
This program is based on the work done on project HyperBroExtractor by HVS-Consulting

Description
This tool is able to decrypt Stage 2 (thumb.dat), decompress and extract the actual hyperBro
PE file(Stage 3), and parse the configuration it embeds.
HyperExtractor will try to automatically bruteforce the 1 byte key and decrypt Stage 2, then it
will decompress the LZNT1 compressed Stage 3 and extract the configuration.
To work with as many samples as possible, this program uses patterns scanning to find
configurations.
In some cases the extraction of the configuration may fail but you can try to search for utf16
strings.
NB: We have recently noticed that some new samples have some of their configuration fields
encrypted or obfuscated and this tool will not be able to extract all of the configutation.

Usage
-i input file (Stage2 e.g: thumb.dat)
-o output file (extracted PE)
.\hyperbro_extractor.exe -i .\samples\thumb_dat.bin -o thumb_dat_extracted_pe.bin

Output Example

Once access gained on the Microsoft Exchange server, adversaries managed to perform an
initial reconnaissance of the network and domain caracteritics, such as hosts, account, policy
enumeration.
This operation was performed by executing a script that lists all domains in the selected
forest, related domain controllers, computer’s names and versions and finally list of domain’s
users and save it into a file named owa_font_[2-letters].css in the directory C:\Program
Files\Microsoft\Exchange

In order to perform internal reconnaissance, adversaries also relied on Windows built-in
commands :

In addition, they used Sysinternals tools PsLoggedon.exe to identify where specific users are
logged in.
They also used Remote Desktop protocol, to connect to computers within the targeted
organisation’s network, and admin shares to move laterally.
The targeted organization was managing numerous domains. APT27 operators managed to
compromised them successively. a few months separated compromise of first domain and
the second one. However, adversaries accelerated their operation and managed to get
access to remaining domains in a few weeks interval.

Adversaries managed to elevate their privileges to the domain administrator level within the
victim’s network and systematically compromised domain controller with HyperBro malware.
In order to stealth authentication materials on compromised hosts, adversaries relied on the
mimikatz tool. However, they tried to stay stealthly and used the sysinternal’s procdump tool,
renamed in error.log to bypass Windows Defender detection and dump lsass process
memory :
C:\Windows\Temp\error.log -accepteula -ma lsass.exe c:\windows\temp\error.dmp
Threat actors also used SysInternal’s PsLoggedon tool to search for specific account usage.
We especially seen that threat actors were interested in backups related accounts usage.
cmd.exe /Q /c PsLoggedon.exe -accepteula [VEEAM_ACCOUNT] 1>

Once access gained on domain controllers, adversaries managed to extract and exfiltrate
NTDS.DIT database.
ntdsutil ac i ntds ifm create full c:\\windows\\temp\\winstore\\ quit quit
Operators then create archive, named error.rar, containing NTDS database prior to
exfiltrating it.
cmd.exe /Q /c rar.exe a -r -y -[PASSWORD] -df c:\windows\temp\error.rar

To prevent detection from Microsoft Windows Defender antivirus, APT27 operators modified
system’s settings to add exclusion path to the Defender’s configuration and remove it once
their operations done.
They achieved that operation with the following command:
The commands below allow attackers to add and remove the C:\windows\temp directory to
Windows Defender excluded folders in order to try hiding in plain sight
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe(cmd.exe /Q /c powershell Get-MpPreference -ExclusionPath

\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[UNIX_EPOCH_DATETIME] 2>&1)
In order to slow down investigations, attackers deleted their tools as well as the archives built
during exfiltration phase. They use the following commands to do so.
cmd.exe /Q /c del rar.exe error.log error1.rar error.dmp 1>

APT27 operators mainly used HyperBro C2 feature to send commands to infected hosts,
using POST request /api/v2/ajax and user-agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64)
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36.
CERT Intrinsec also discovered a second application used to expose the targeted
organisation’s internal network to adversaries.
The application is a reverse SOCKS proxy written in GoLang called Chisel. It transports
TCP/UDP traffic over SSH, which is encapsulated into HTTP.
APT27 operators executed Chisel using wmic and rename it to veeamGues.exe to hide it in
plain sight. The following command runs a server listening on port 9080 allowing clients to
access the SOCKS5 proxy.
cmd.exe /Q /c wmic /node:127.0.0.1 process call create cmd /c

Once APT27 operators have stolen credentials, they started the collection process by
checking size and usage of directories. To do so, they used diruse command, as illustrated
below.
cmd.exe /Q /c wmic /node:127.0.0.1 process call create cmd /c
D:\$RECYCLE.BIN\diruse.exe /m /* D:\data >> D:\$RECYCLE.BIN\temD.txt 1>
\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[UNIX_EPOCH_DATETIME] 2>&1)
Operators then browsed directories in order to find personal information and data related to
research and development, leveraging dir command and wmic to look for files on network
shares.

Once they found relevant data, they created password-protected archives using -t to test files
after archiving, -inul to disable all messages, -hp to provide a password and -v to adjust size.
wmic /node:[IP_ADDRESS] /user:[USER_ACCOUNT] /password:[PASSWORD] process call
create “cmd /c c:\temp\rar.exe a c:\temp\temp.rar c:\temp\temp.dat -r -t -inul hp[PASSWORD] -v[SIZE]

Besides, APT27 operators collected data about mailboxes on the Exchange server, using
Get-Mailbox powershell command, as shown below :
cmd.exe /Q /c powershell -c Add-PSSnapin

Exfiltration

T1071.001

Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols

Attackers used different methods to exfiltrate data.
First, archives containing stolen data were moved to the Exchange server, in the Exchange
folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\themes\resources\, an easy way to
exfiltrate data as this server had direct access to the Internet. These RAR archives were
renamed with a .png file extension to hide in plain sight and try to avoid detection. Attackers
then deleted them. By investigating files and Exchange server, CERT Intrinsec managed to
carve some archives from disk images and retrieve passwords used to create the latter. It
was then possible to know which data were exfiltrated by attackers.
You can see below archives’ names created by the attackers prior to exfiltrating.

Attackers used HyperBro command and control server as well to exfiltrate WinRAR archives.
Most of the exfiltration was carried out in 26 days and involve gigabytes of data, from 4
different domains.

APT27 Intrusion Set
The following diagram sums up APT27 techniques, tactics and procedures.

15/17

Lessons Learned
To prevent those types of attacks, CERT Intrinsec recommends monitoring network and
endpoints activities. Indeed, supervising network equipments allows to track down
malicious activities performed by advanced persistent threat, including command and control
communications and exfiltration. Depending on your situations : XDR / MDR approaches
combined with SOC and proper threat intelligence.
Ensuring a proper log retention and storage is a good way to improve detection of
malicious behaviour.
Handling network, Active Directory hardening especially regarding trusts, and least
privilege principle is very important to slow down attackers in the event of an intrusion.
When compromising servers, particularly domain controllers, operators are used to execute
commands to collect credentials or to dump NTDS database. Very useful information
sources are available on systems and need to be monitored to spot attackers’ actions. These
sources are Sysmon, that allows to log various events helping detection, and Microsoft
Protection Logs where many evidences were found during the investigation. CERT Intrinsec
published an article about this artefact and a parser to extract useful informations from it. You
can read this article here.
As explained previously, adversaries can take advantage of a vulnerable exposed server to
enter the corporate’s network. That shows the importance of keeping public-facing
equipments up-to-date and managing vulnerabilities (support at least by an external
asset security monitoring approach to ensure a second line of defense in complexe /
fast evolving environment).
