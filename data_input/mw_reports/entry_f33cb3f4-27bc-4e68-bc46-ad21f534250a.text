to Host Its Malware

Juniper Threat Labs has detected a new development in the Aggah malware campaign.
Previously, Aggah was known to be using legitimate infrastructures like BlogSpot, WordPress and
Pastebin to host its malware. Recently, we discovered an ongoing campaign where Aggah threat
actors host their malware using Zendesk attachments and GitHub. This campaign delivers several
types of malware that are focused on stealing sensitive information, such as usernames and
passwords, credit card information stored in browsers and crypto wallets.
We detected a malicious Microsoft PowerPoint sample,
ed70f584de47480ee706e2f6ee65db591e00a114843fa53c1171b69d43336ffe , which was

downloaded from Zendesk’s own infrastructure as an attachment:
http://p17[.]zdusercontent[.]com/attachment/9061705/eyckz3zuedoivxtp0i629aoxe

The PowerPoint document contains a malicious macro file that connects to a shortened
bitly.com URL which expands to
https://mujhepyaslagihaimujhepanipilao[.]blogspot[.]com/p/mark2html in order
download and execute a malicious Script via mshta.exe.

https://mujhepyaslagihaimujhepanipilao[.]blogspot[.]com/p/mark2htmlThe script, mark2.html ,
hosted on mujhepyaslagihaimujhepanipilao[.]blogspot[.]com , performs a series of
operations, such as creating a Run entry in the registry to execute a PowerShell script, download
and execute another script using scheduled task and use WMI in the registry Run key to
download and execute another script.

The code shown in Figure 3 downloads from the following links and executes them.

Blessed.txt
The PowerShell script is hosted on archive.org as blessed.txt . The PowerShell loads a stealer
malware, known as Oski. The Oski malware is included in the PowerShell script as a hex-encoded
string. It uses a technique known as Signed Binary execution via RegSvcs.exe and .NET
Assembly.Load to load this binary as an added layer of protection since it’s not saved to the
disk and only stays in memory.

Fig. 4 Blessed.txt is a PowerShell script that contains a Windows executable which it loads via
RegSvcs.exe
Oski was first seen in 2019. Today, it’s sold in Russian hacking forums for $70-$100. Oski
malware’s capabilities include:
Stealing cryptocurrency wallets
Stealing sensitive information stored in browsers such as credit card data, autofill data and
cookies
Stealing credentials from various applications such as FTP, VPN and web browsers
Capturing screenshots
Collecting system information
Downloading and installing additional malware

Oski connects to the following C2 server: 103.153.76.164
After it collects and exfiltrates the data, it will delete traces of itself in the system.
Elevatednew1.html
One other routine that we have listed above in Fig. 3 includes creating a scheduled task to
download and execute another malicious script hosted on
https://randikhanaekminar[.]blogspot[.]com/p/elevatednew1.html . This malicious
script loads another PowerShell script named blessed.txt . This time, the script is hosted in
GitHub as follows:
https://raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/manasshole/newone/main/blessed.txt

Fig. 6 Script code inside elevatednew1.html executes a PowerShell hosted in GitHub.com
The malware that it tries to install is Agent Tesla, a .NET keylogger and RAT that logs keystrokes
and the host’s clipboard content.
The other malicious scripts backbone15.html and ghostbackup14.html are no longer
available for download, while elevatednew1backup.html is the same as elevatednew1.html
Before publication of this blog, we have contacted Zendesk and Github and they quickly
responded to disable the hosted malware.
Conclusion
The threat actors’ primary goal is to steal sensitive information such as usernames and
passwords, credit cards and crypto wallets. On the surface, this may seem to have a low impact in
comparison with ransomware operations targeting enterprises. However, the Aggah threat actors’
method of using legitimate infrastructure is worrisome. As a defender, one way to disrupt
malicious activity is to detect their infrastructure. This is usually effective as it’s not that easy to
change infrastructures.
As we have observed and noted, threat actors using GitHub, Archive.org, Zendesk, GitHub,
Pastebin and Google Drive are not going away anytime soon and we expect their malicious efforts
to continue. For instance, Juniper Threat Labs has also seen a growing usage of Zendesk to host
malware, which may warrant its own blog in the future.
In this particular case, Juniper Networks’ Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP) solution detects the
Aggah malware file as follows:
