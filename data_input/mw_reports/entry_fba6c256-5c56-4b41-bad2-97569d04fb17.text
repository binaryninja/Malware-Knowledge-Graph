PrivateLoader: The first step in many malware schemes
intel471.com/blog/privateloader-malware

Pay-per-install (PPI) malware services have been an integral part of the cybercrime ecosystem for a considerable amount of time. A
malware operator provides payment, malicious payloads and targeting information, and those responsible for running the service
outsource the distribution and delivery. The accessibility and moderate costs allow malware operators to leverage these services as
another weapon for rapid, bulk and geo-targeted malware infections.
By understanding how these services proliferate, defenders can better recognize these campaigns and stop them from wreaking
havoc on their organization’s IT stack. This report focuses on the PrivateLoader modular downloader programmed in the C++
programming language connected to an unidentified PPI service. PrivateLoader sits at the front of this operation and communicates
with its back-end infrastructure to retrieve URLs for the malicious payloads to “install” on the infected host. As is the case with
downloaders tied to PPI services, PrivateLoader communicates a variety of statistics such as which payloads were downloaded and
launched successfully.
Distribution campaigns generally rely on a network of search engine optimization (SEO) enhanced websites that lure unsuspecting
victims searching for warez aka pirated software to download and execute malware. A password-protected archive typically is
delivered that contains a setup file that embeds and executes multiple malicious payloads on the infected host such as GCleaner,
PrivateLoader, Raccoon, Redline, Smokeloader and Vidar malware. We assess these campaigns started to incorporate
PrivateLoader since at least May 2021.
This report investigates the PPI service behind it and methods operators employ to obtain “installs” and presents details about the
malware families the service delivers.

How PrivateLoader works
The service behind this PrivateLoader PPI campaign and its operators are unknown, as it was not possible to connect the
downloader to a specific underground PPI service at the time of this report. However, we observed PrivateLoader’s main command
and control (C2) servers also host the administration panel, which is based on the AdminLTE 3 dashboard template. The image
below shows the authentication page:

Delivering the PrivateLoader downloader
PrivateLoader is delivered through a network of websites that claim to provide “cracked” software, which is modified versions of
popular legitimate applications that people commonly use. These websites are SEO optimized and usually appear at the top of
search queries that contain keywords such as “crack” or “crack download,” preceded by the software name.
For example, a search for “Malwarebytes crack” returns the following websites as the fourth and fifth results:

3/12

This image depicts “Malwarebytes crack” search results.

Visitors are lured into clicking a “Download Crack” or “Download Now” button to obtain an allegedly cracked version of the
software. The JavaScript for the download button is retrieved from a remote server.

This image depicts an option to allegedly download a cracked version of the software.

After a few redirections, the final payload is served to the user as a password-protected compressed (.zip) archive. The screenshot
below shows the actual download page:

This image depicts the download page.

In our example, the archive served was named “PASSWORD_IS_324325____Malwarebytes-Pr.zip.” It contained a Nullsoft
Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installer named “setup_x86_x64_install.exe,” which embeds and executes numerous malicious
payloads such as GCleaner, PrivateLoader and Redline.
Researchers from SophosLabs previously investigated this delivery network and tied some of its infrastructure to the InstallUSD
PPI service.

Malware families dropped
Automated malware coverage and tracking for PrivateLoader started in early September 2021. We have since gathered sizable
amounts of data that helped us learn more about the service.
The following chart shows the number of unique hashes downloaded by PrivateLoader for each malware family our Malware
Intelligence systems detected. The most popular families this PPI service distributed in descending order were Smokeloader,
Redline and Vidar:

4/12

This chart shows the number of unique hashes downloaded by PrivateLoader for each malware family our Malware Intelligence systems
detected.

Each PrivateLoader sample embeds a region code that is communicated to the C2 server and country of the bot. The chart below
depicts the number of unique hashes downloaded per region code in the duration of coverage. We believe the “WW” prefix in these
region codes stands for “worldwide,” since it was most commonly found in samples. On the panel side, we suspect this code
represents the “link_geo” parameter described in the previous table.

This chart depicts the number of unique hashes downloaded per region code.

However, we observe a different distribution when querying the number of unique hashes by bots’ country codes (see: chart below).
This is expected since popular worldwide region codes encapsulate multiple countries.

Smokeloader
Of the payloads we saw pushed by PrivateLoader, the most common was Smokeloader. The following chart shows the extracted
affiliate IDs (or lack thereof) from all unique Smokeloader samples detected by our Malware Intelligence systems:

It’s apparent the operators running the “Privacy tools” domains heavily rely on PrivateLoader to deliver Smokeloader. An inspection
of active distribution URLs showed these domains host a website that claims to offer “Privacy Tools.” This website likely is spoofing
the real PrivacyTools[.]io website run by volunteers who advocate for data privacy.

This image depicts the landing page of one of the “Privacy tools” domains.

These websites host Smokeloader payloads as part of three categories named “pab1”, “pab2” and “pab3”. These are not necessarily
linked to the analogous “pub*” affiliate IDs, since we have seen some “pab2” payloads with the “555” affiliate ID. While tracking
PrivateLoader, we only received links to download the “pab2” payloads from these websites. It is likely these operators use other
methods or PPI services to distribute the Smokeloader family.
On Oct. 22, 2021, a “pab2” Smokeloader sample downloaded by PrivateLoader from one of these websites delivered the Qbot
banking trojan. This is an unusual distribution method for Qbot and revealed the new botnet ID star01.

Banking trojans
There are other actors throughout the underground that leverage PrivateLoader for banking trojan distribution.
On Oct. 31, 2021, PrivateLoader bots connecting from European countries were instructed to download and execute the Kronos
banking trojan from the following URL:
hxxp://2.56.59[.]42/EU/Yandex1500[.]exe
The downloaded sample also executed the Vidar information stealer. The download and execute commands for this sample stopped
the following day.
On Nov. 1, 2021, PrivateLoader bots downloaded Dridex samples tied to the 10444 botnet, and Danabot with the affiliate identifier
40. The same day, bots also downloaded Trickbot samples with the group tags (gtags) lip*, tot* and top*. In all cases, the delivered
samples embedded other malware families such as other banking trojans, information stealers or ransomware.

The sample with the hash 929a591331bdc1972357059d451a651d575166f676ea51daaeb358aa2a1064b7 that embedded both Dridex
and Smokeloader was downloaded from the following URL:
hxxp://privacytoolzfor-you6000[.]top/downloads/toolspab2.exe

In the previous subsection, we linked the “Privacy tools” websites to Smokeloader operators. It is unclear whether the operators
behind these websites operated the Dridex 10444 botnet or only acted as a link in the delivery chain. However, we can assume the
“Privacy tools” website was used for distribution since the same Dridex botnet identifier and controllers were seen across different
hashes and delivery URLs during this period.
Seeing downloads for Danabot, Dridex, Kronos and Trickbot for the first time within the same time frame hardly can be regarded as
a coincidence. Moreover, these trojans often were bundled with each other. Therefore, we assess a single entity likely operating
these specific botnets was using the PrivateLoader PPI service at the time.
On Nov. 14, 2021, PrivateLoader bots started to download samples of the Danabot banking trojan with the affiliate ID 4 for a single
day.
Based on these short outbursts that lasted no more than a day, we suspect the banking trojan operators were experimenting with
this PPI service as another delivery mechanism for their malware.

Ransomware
Underground PPI services generally advise against deploying ransomware on target machines since it renders them unusable.
However, cybercriminals have a reputation of not adhering to rules and deploy ransomware anyway.
The only time in which we detected ransomware samples downloaded by PrivateLoader was when it dropped banking trojans in
early November 2021. The table in the previous subsection showed downloads for the LockBit and STOP Djvu ransomware families.
While analyzing payloads downloaded by PrivateLoader, we identified a new loader we dubbed Discoloader. Discoloader was
written using the .NET framework and uses the Discord content delivery network (CDN) to host its payload. Although not directly
from PrivateLoader, we observed samples of this family delivering Conti ransomware directly into infected hosts, which is an
uncharacteristic delivery mechanism since this family typically only is deployed after total compromise of enterprise networks.

Conclusion
PPI services have been a pillar of cybercrime for decades. Just like the wider population, criminals are going to flock to software
that provides them a wide array of options to easily achieve their goals. As we have detailed, criminals have used PrivateLoader to
launch all kinds of schemes. By highlighting the versatility of this malware, we hope to give defenders the chance to develop unique
strategies in thwarting malware attacks empowered by PrivateLoader.
