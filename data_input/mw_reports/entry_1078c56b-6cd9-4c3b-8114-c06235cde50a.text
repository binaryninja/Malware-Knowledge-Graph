NEWLY OBSERVED
CRYPTOMINER

INTRODUCTION
Pondurance’s Threat Hunting and Response (TH+R) team has encountered a variety of Cryptocurrency Miner outbreaks
throughout the first quarter of 2018, led by the prevalent and crippling WannaMine Cryptominer that desires 100% CPU usage
and renders affected systems virtually unusable. WannaMine is particularly innovative due to incorporating a credentialharvesting module and the EternalBlue SMBv1 exploit to perform lateral movements and privilege escalation on a victim
network. On March 22, 2018, when Pondurance’s TH+R team observed a large quantity of systems downloading PowerShell
.ps1 scripts combined with connections to cryptomining pools, their fear was another WannaMine outbreak. However, upon
further observation, they realized the outbreak was from a newly observed Cryptominer.

TECHNICAL CHAIN OF EVENTS
All affected systems exhibited the same sequence of HTTP GET requests from an external server hosted at 191.101.21.81.
These requests included one .ps1 file, six .txt files, and one .xml file (Fig. 1).

The first PowerShell script arrived in plaintext and downloaded the remaining files, in addition to revealing various
persistence mechanisms for the malware. This malware appears to differ from other miners in that it modifies the following
registry keys:
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Power\PowerSettings -Name a -Value $a
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Power\PowerSettings -Name b -Value $b
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Power\PowerSettings -Name c -Value $c
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Power\PowerSettings -Name d -Value $d
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Power\PowerSettings -Name e -Value $e
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Power\PowerSettings -Name x -Value $firstScript
From here, the PowerShell script establishes the ReportScriptErrors.xml as a Scheduled Task. The final step of this script
launched a powercfg.exe process, with the apparent goal of retaining the ability to wake from sleep (Fig. 2).

The next five scripts, [a-e]_32.txt, arrived in a base64 encoded format. Pondurance was able to identify all txt files as
containing data consistent with an executable, but only a_32.txt held the executable-identifying MZ header. Pondurance
appended these in reverse order and decoded the base64 to reach an executable approximately 1MB in size that was
compiled on 03-19-2018. This executable was observed reaching out to two different IPs for mining purposes. Additionally, a
third and unused mining IP was found in the executable’s code. The final script, first_script.txt, fed commands into
PowerShell.exe and also referenced calls to the Invoke_ReflectivePEInjection, often leveraged in pentesting, which is used to
inject executable code into legitimate processes. At this time, the specific code that may have been injected has not been
determined. Additionally, there remains a partial custom-encoded portion of this script that Pondurance has not fully decoded
yet.
Pondurance also leveraged their pre-deployed EDR agent to identify a malicious PowerShell.exe instance (Fig. 3) that was
launched from \sys32\taskeng.exe (taskeng.exe was launched by \sys32\svchost.exe). This PowerShell process held open a
tcp connection to 142.91.104.87 over port 80.

It was determined that all affected systems resided in a network that was not connected to the victim’s domain and did not
leverage Active Directory. Additionally, it was then uncovered that this environment was maintained by a vendor that
leveraged a remote access agent for each system in the environment. After the victim contacted the vendor, the vendor
acknowledged they had been compromised and potentially affected a large number of clients.

CONCLUSION
While this malware did not appear to possess the lateral-moving capabilities and exfiltration capabilities of WannaMine, it
does present a significant concern for 3rd party remote access and privileges in a network. Had this network been connected
to the main victim domain, the risk of further compromise would have been significantly higher.
