Introduction
FortiGuard Labs has discovered yet another COVID themed lure designed to compel
unsuspecting victims to click on what appears at first be an innocuous link. However,
unbeknownst to the target, the link leads to a zip file that contains malicious attachments.

This blog will highlight the steps taken by an unnamed threat actor targeting the security
interests of a former Eastern bloc nation.

Key Takeaways of This Blog
Spearphishing emails were sent to various security arms of the Ukrainian government
utilizing social engineering lures containing subjects such as: “New COVID-21 Variant”
and “An Urgent Computer Update”.

other downloaders.

Overview
This latest iteration of the COVID-themed lures we have been seeing over the past year is
not about COVID-19, but a fictitious COVID-21 (bypassing the equally fictitious COVID-20
entirely!) using a fake World Health Organization (WHO) link. It is likely that the threat actor
is hoping that the novelty of a COVID-21 announcement might entice the recipient into
following the link, either through misjudgment or sheer curiosity. The following research looks
at possible motivations for this particular attack, as well as provides technical analysis of the
malware involved and related infrastructure.
In this case, we have observed specific instances of spearphishing emails being sent to
various arms of the Ukrainian government and have also identified that the infrastructure
used for these attacks originates in Russia. The first instance we detected targeted two
separate entities of the Ukrainian government, both dealing with security interests of the
Ukrainian state.
Figure 1. Message body of the COVID-21 Lure
The email purports to originate from a “Political Officer” at the United States Embassy.
Interestingly, a search engine check revealed that Political Officer is indeed an actual title
within the US State Department. Further, a review of the email headers highlights that the
sender is either a legitimate Gmail account created for such spam purposes, or one that has
been compromised, as the email was relayed through Gmail servers. Sending spam email
through clean reputable servers as a relay is an ideal tactic for attackers as they are often
allowed to bypass spam filtering software since they originate from a reputable IP block.
This email is targeting one of the security arms of the Ukrainian Government. However, a
search engine result yielded no results for the email address, which leads us to believe that
this is either a targeted or a dictionary/harvest based attack.

2/12

Another tactic observed was that the threat actors used masqueraded emails within the
message body containing a back and forth conversation between (likely fictitious) personnel
at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Department of State
(state.gov). We surmise that this email is targeted as it includes government-specific
communication and not, for example, a generic purchase order from a random industry
vertical, etc.

Technical Details
Instead of using attachments, this lure opted to use a link to deliver its payload, further
ensuring that the spearphishing email makes it to the intended victim by bypassing security
tools that detect and neutralize malicious attachments. The fake WHO link goes to
hxxps://cut[.]ly/LcHx2Ga, which redirects to hxxp://2330[.]site/NewCovid-21[.]zip. The
contents of the zip archive are shown below.
Figure 2. Zip file archive
The PDF is legitimate and not malicious. The other files however, are each malicious in their
own way. The two shortcut files appear to launch cmd.exe. However, after examining these
two files further, we found that the true attack vector actually uses cmd.exe to launch
PowerShell in order to download and execute yet another malicious file.
The final file contained in the zip archive is a malicious document that exploits CVE-201711882 (Microsoft Office Equation Editor Vulnerability) and acts similarly to the shortcut files.
Affecting multiple Microsoft Office versions, up to Word 2016, CVE-2017-11882 allows
arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user by failing to properly handle
objects in memory. By exploiting this vulnerability, the document is able to download and
execute yet another malicious file.
Each of these malicious files will be explored further in the next sections.

Malicious Shortcuts (LNK) Files
The shortcut files at first appear to be benign:
Figure 3. Properties of LNK file
Nothing except cmd.exe and whitespace can be seen. Peering into the .lnk file itself with a
hex editor, or even a strings command, however, shows there is a PowerShell command
hidden within. The essence of this command is to download a file from
hxxp://2330[.]site/soft/08042021[.]exe and saves it as %TEMP%\WindowsUpdate.exe. It
then executes the downloaded file.
A cursory review of the 2330.site reveals that the domain has been associated with the
following IP addresses in the past:
3/12

95.143.218[.]55
31.31.205[.]163
195.128.123[.]215
185.195.27[.]112
176.113.115[.]133
All of these IP addresses resolve back to the Russian Federation.
A quick perusal of the WindowsUpdate.exe files shows that it is packed. Underneath the
surface lies an AutoIT file that cannot be decompiled by a standard decompiler. To get
around this roadblock, the AutoIT compiled script can be found in memory and dumped into
a separate file.
Figure 4. AutoIT compiled script from memory
The bytecode in this file can then be decompiled properly.
Figure 5. Results after decompiling
This AutoIT script is designed to exfiltrate user files. It targets filetypes located in the user’s
home directory and uploads them to a server.
The targeted filetypes are: .doc, .pdf, .ppt, .dot, .xl, .csv, .rtf, .mdb, .acdb, .pot, .pps, .ppa,
.rar, .zip, .tar, .7z.
Figure 6. Filetypes targeted
Given the branches of the government targeted by this phishing attack, the filetypes being
captured could potentially vary from benign to sensitive to even classified information.
Files stolen by this script are uploaded to hxxp://name4050[.]com:8080/upld/

Malicious Word Document
The last file in the NewCovid-21.zip archive is a malicious document that exploits CVE-201711882 (Microsoft Equation Editor Vulnerability). The exploit forces the user to visit
hxxp://bit[.]ly/3rQULnp. The user is then redirected to a predetermined URL,
hxxp://name1d[.]site/index.txt. This is not a text file, but a PE file that then gets executed.

Part 1 of Social Engineering Lures
The downloaded PE file is also packed. After some investigation, we determined that its
contents are similar to the files downloaded by the LNK files.
Figure 7. Analysis of downloaded PE file from hxxp://name1d[.]site/index.txt

4/12

The only significant difference in this sample is that it uploads gathered files to a different C2
server: hxxp://31.42.185[.]63:8080/upld/. The list of filetypes is still the same.

Part 2 - A Saint Amongst Blocs
Sometime later, a different index.txt file was served, possibly for a different campaign. We
analyzed this new file as well. It is a PE file that is a variant of the Saint malware recently
discovered by security researchers. As it is a downloader, its possible uses are limitless. It
has been observed to even download other downloaders as well.
This version turned out to be Saint_v3, which operates similarly to the one analyzed here:
(https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2021/04/a-deep-dive-into-saint-botdownloader/). However, the C2 server this variant goes to is hxxp://smm2021[.]net/wpadm/gate.php and it uses compromised WordPress sites to communicate. It may also use
8003659902[.]site as well as 8003659902[.]space as part of its network infrastructure.
Saint_v3 has specific functionality in case it ends up running on a Windows 10 machine. It
checks the registry for the ProductName to see if it is Windows 10. If so, it then checks for
another registry setting, called ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin, to see if it has a value of 5.
Microsoft defines this value as: ‘[T]he default. It is used to prompt the administrator in Admin
Approval Mode to select either "Permit" or "Deny" for an operation that requires elevation of
privilege for any non-Windows binaries. If the Consent Admin selects Permit, the operation
will continue with the highest available privilege. This operation will happen on the secure
desktop.’
It then performs a few other actions under a Windows 10 environment.
One unique thing that was observed is that this malware will not run on an infected computer
running one of the following locales:
Figure 8. Locales avoided by Saint Malware
Given that the phishing email gathered indicates that it is targeting a victim based in the
former Eastern Bloc, and may be using one of the listed locales, one wonders if the attackers
have narrowed down their target to the point they know the victim does not use any of these
locales? Perhaps as a defensive posture, the victim was using English or another version,
and the attacker knew this? In any case, this just adds another layer of mystery to this attack.
Even though there is not much code in the AutoIT samples, the same coding method is seen
in the downloaded Saint_v3 files.
Figure 9. Cleaning up all evidence
The cleanup functions are somewhat similar.

Urgent Update Variation
Another sample that we observed appears to be related to this same campaign, and is
likewise targeting a security arm of the Ukrainian government. Its email purports to be
coming from the main security arm of the Ukrainian government, and the link attempts to
convince the target that orders are coming from higher in the chain of command, possibly
hoping that the link will be clicked on in a moment of misjudgment. The email address that
this spearphishing email is being sent from can actually be found on the main page of the
website of this security arm of the Ukrainian government:
Figure 10. Original Urgent Update Email
Figure 11. Urgent Update Email (Translated to English)
The broken text in the subject line that could not be rendered is:
Tермінове оновлення !!!
Which translates to English as:
Urgent Update
Clicking on the forged [redacted].gov.ua update link leads to a bit.ly URL shortener link that
goes to redirect[.]co.ua, which then redirects to a predetermined download site that contains
the following zip file:
hxxp://2215[.]site/soft2/Update-AV[.]zip
This Update-AV file
[C33A905E513005CEE9071ED10933B8E6A11BE2335755660E3F7B2ADF554F704A] is
also a malicious Saint_v3 file. The icon used by this malware is the country’s flag with a
shield on it to lend a sense that this is a legitimate protection update, as the email alluded to.
Figure 12: Malicious Update-AV file
Notice the similarity in the nomenclature between both domains (2215[.]site and 2330[.]site).
The 2215[.]site domain is registered to fed****kar@rambler[.]ru. As of April 21st, both of
these domains share the same IP address, [176[.]113.115.133]. While performing a dig on
both domains we discovered the following:
Figure 13. Dig for 2215[.]site
Figure 13b. Dig for 2330[.]site

6/12

We can assume that these sites are both under the control of the same attacker or attacking
group. Because of the similarity of the attacks to the examples above, we will focus on the
shared infrastructure between the 2330[.]site and 2215[.]site that ties both campaigns
together.
Connecting the dots
A search on the 2330[.]site domain reveals that the domain is registered to the email contact
kun*******1969@rambler[.]ru. Subsequent searches reveal that the registrant owns the
following domains:
1017[.]site
1202[.]site
2330[.]site
29572459487545-4543543-543534255-454-35432524-5243523-234543[.]xyz (this had only
been registered for three days at the time of writing)
Below is a screenshot tying in the infrastructure below, along with the connection to the IP
address 176[.]113.115.133 to the following domains:
2330[.]site
2115[.]site
29572459487545-4543543-543534255-454-35432524-5243523-234543[.]xyz

Conclusion
The spearphishing examples above highlight the ways that attackers leverage simple
techniques to coerce and compel a target into following a link. Although, the attacker in this
case has spent time crafting the spearphishing email, setting up the fake URLs that lead
elsewhere, and using the Saint_v3 malware, this is by no means a sophisticated attack. But
planning something like this, including the infrastructure that goes with it, takes time and
resources.
One example of the lack of sophistication of this spearphishing email is that it is obvious that
the message body appears to be rushed, given the grammar issues, etc. And the strategy
used is not unique. It is the same old spearphishing strategy that we’ve seen many times
before. However, the Covid-21 lure is unique and preys on the public’s fears of the
unknown.
What is most concerning is that such attacks are often successful, and the malware being
delivered can just be the beginning of a bigger attack as Saint itself is a downloader. And
once a backdoor access is achieved, a multitude of things can occur, such as a ransomware
infection, damage to the reputation and bottom line of any organizations, and given the
agencies targeted in this campaign, the potential loss of sensitive information and state
secrets.
In the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter how ineffective or rushed an attack like
this might be, because all it takes is a one mistake by one of the targeted victims. And once
this occurs, the attacker has a beachhead within which to establish a foothold. When political
tensions are high, gathering intelligence is critical. And it is easy to just send widespread and
far flung lures in the hope of getting one person to fall prey as part of a larger strategy. All it
takes is one bite and you are in.
Attackers know that there are many layers of security that they have to get through to get the
data or resources they are targeting. And although there have been many technological
advancements in security over time, the weakest link in any defense is still the human one.
Because humans are fallible, organization must take the time to train and emphasize to its
employees that such attacks exist—and happen quite often. They need to be the focus of
continuous internal security training sessions, as no amount of technology can stop human
curiosity, fear, and misjudgment.
