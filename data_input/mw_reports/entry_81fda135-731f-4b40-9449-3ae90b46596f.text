W32.Disttrack is a new threat that is being used in specific targeted attacks against at least
one organization in the energy sector. It is a destructive malware that corrupts files on a
compromised computer and overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) in an effort to render
a computer unusable.
W32.Disttrack consists of several components:
1. Dropper—the main component and source of the original infection. It drops a number
of other modules.
2. Wiper—this module is responsible for the destructive functionality of the threat.
3. Reporter—this module is responsible for reporting infection information back to the
attacker.

Dropper Component
The Dropper component performs the following actions:
Copies itself to %System%\trksvr.exe

1/5

Drops the following files embedded into resources:
A 64-bit version of the dropper component: %System%\trksrv.exe (contained in
the “X509” resource)
Reporter component: %System%\netinit.exe (contained in the "PKCS7" resource)
Wiper component: %System%\[NAME SELECTED FROM LIST].exe (contained
in the "PKCS12" resource)
Note: The name of the component is selected from the following list:
caclsrv
certutl
clean
ctrl
dfrag
dnslookup
dvdquery
event
extract
findfile
fsutl
gpget
iissrv
ipsecure
msinit
ntx
ntdsutl
ntfrsutil
ntnw
power
rdsadmin
regsys
routeman
rrasrv
sacses
sfmsc
sigver
smbinit
wcscript
Copies itself to the following network shares:
ADMIN$
C$\\WINDOWS
D$\\WINDOWS
E$\\WINDOWS
Creates a task to execute itself

2/5

Creates the following service to start itself whenever Windows starts:
Service name: TrkSvr
Display name: Distributed Link Tracking Server
Image path: %System%\trksvr.exe

Wiper Component
The Wiper component includes the following functionality:
Deletes an existing driver from the following location and overwrites it with another
legitimate driver:
%System%\drivers\drdisk.sys
The device driver is a clean disk driver that enables user-mode applications to
read and write to disk sectors. The driver is used to overwrite the computer’s
MBR but may be used for legitimate purposes.
The file is digitally signed
Executes the following commands that collect file names, which will be overwritten and
writes them to f1.inf and f2.inf:

Files from the f1.inf and f2.inf will be overwritten with the JPEG image shown below.
Overwritten files are thus rendered useless.

3/5

Finally, the component will overwrite the MBR so that the compromised computer can
no longer start
The following string that points to the location of debug symbols was left in the Wiper
component of this threat and gives an idea of where the component was located on the
developer’s computer:
C:\Shamoon\ArabianGulf\wiper\release\wiper.pdb

Reporter Component
The Reporter component is responsible for sending infection information back to the
attacker. Information is sent as a HTTP GET request and is structured as follows:
http://[DOMAIN]/ajax_modal/modal/data.asp?mydata=[MYDATA]&uid=[UID]&state=[STATE]
The following data is sent to the attacker:
[DOMAIN]—a domain name
[MYDATA]—a number that specifies how many files were overwritten
[UID]—the IP address of the compromised computer
4/5

[STATE]—a random number
Threats with such destructive payloads are unusual and are not typical of targeted attacks.
Symantec Security Response is continuing to analyze this threat and will post more
information as it becomes available. Symantec customers are protected from this threat,
which our security products detect as W32.Disttrack.
