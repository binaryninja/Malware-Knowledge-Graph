News Corp was the target of a hack that accessed emails and documents of journalists and
other employees, an incursion the company’s cybersecurity consultant said was likely meant
to gather intelligence to benefit China’s interests.
The attack, discovered on Jan. 20, affected a number of publications and business units
including The Wall Street Journal and its parent Dow Jones; the New York Post; the
company’s U.K. news operation; and News Corp headquarters, according to an email the
company sent to staff Friday.
