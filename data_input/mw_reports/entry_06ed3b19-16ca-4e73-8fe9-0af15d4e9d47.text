Cyberattacks target international conference attendees

October 28, 2020

Today, we’re sharing that we have detected and worked to stop a series of cyberattacks from
the threat actor Phosphorus masquerading as conference organizers to target more than 100
high-profile individuals. Phosphorus, an Iranian actor, has targeted with this scheme potential
attendees of the upcoming Munich Security Conference and the Think 20 (T20) Summit in
Saudi Arabia. The Munich Security Conference is the most important gathering on the topic
of security for heads of state and other world leaders, and it has been held annually for
nearly 60 years. Likewise, T20 is a highly visible event that shapes policy ideas for the G20
nations and informs their critical discussions.
Based on current analysis, we do not believe this activity is tied to the U.S. elections in any
way.
The attackers have been sending possible attendees spoofed invitations by email. The
emails use near-perfect English and were sent to former government officials, policy experts,
academics and leaders from non-governmental organizations. Phosphorus helped assuage
fears of travel during the Covid-19 pandemic by offering remote sessions.
We believe Phosphorus is engaging in these attacks for intelligence collection purposes. The
attacks were successful in compromising several victims, including former
ambassadors and other senior policy experts who help shape global agendas and foreign
policies in their respective countries.

This activity was uncovered by Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center, or MSTIC, which
tracks the world’s nation-state and cybercrime actors so we can better protect our customers.
MSTIC is also critical to the work of our Defending Democracy Program, powering our
AccountGuard threat notification service available in 30 countries worldwide and fueling the
intelligence we share to help keep elections secure. We build new protections into our
products regularly based on the threats MSTIC uncovers.
We’ve already worked with conference organizers who have warned and will continue to
warn their attendees, and we’re disclosing what we’ve seen so that everyone can remain
vigilant to this approach being used in connection with other conferences or events.
We recommend people evaluate the authenticity of emails they receive about major
conferences by ensuring that the sender address looks legitimate and that any embedded
links redirect to the official conference domain. As always, enabling multi-factor
authentication across both business and personal email accounts will successfully thwart
most credential harvesting attacks like these. For anyone who suspects they may have been
a victim of this campaign, we also encourage a close review of email-forwarding rules in
accounts to identify and remove any suspicious rules that may have been set during a
successful compromise.
We are also sharing the indicators of compromise (IOCs) observed during these activities.
We encourage IT teams to implement detections and protections to identify possible prior
campaigns and prevent future campaigns against their users. These indicators include phony
email accounts and domains or websites used to steal victims’ credentials.

As we noted in our recent Digital Defense Report, nation-state cyberattackers routinely
pursue think tanks, policy organizations and governmental and non-governmental
organizations, seeking information that an attacker can use for their benefit. We will continue
to use a combination of technology, operations, legal action and policy to disrupt and deter
malicious activity, but nothing replaces vigilance from people who are likely targets of these
operations.
