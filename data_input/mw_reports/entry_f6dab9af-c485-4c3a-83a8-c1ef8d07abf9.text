ALPHV Ransomware Affiliate Targets Vulnerable Backup
Installations to Gain Initial Access
mandiant.com/resources/blog/alphv-ransomware-backup

Mandiant has observed a new ALPHV (aka BlackCat ransomware) ransomware affiliate,
tracked as UNC4466, target publicly exposed Veritas Backup Exec installations, vulnerable
to CVE-2021-27876, CVE-2021-27877 and CVE-2021-27878, for initial access to victim
environments. A commercial Internet scanning service identified over 8,500 installations of
Veritas Backup Exec instances that are currently exposed to the internet, some of which may
still be unpatched and vulnerable. Previous ALPHV intrusions investigated by Mandiant
primarily originated from stolen credentials suggesting a shift to opportunistic targeting of
known vulnerabilities. This blog post covers the UNC4466 attack lifecycle, indicators, and
detection opportunities.

1/11

ALPHV emerged in November 2021 as a ransomware-as-a-service that some researchers
have claimed is the successor to BLACKMATTER and DARKSIDE ransomware. While some
ransomware operators enacted rules to avoid impacting critical infrastructure and health
entities, ALPHV has continued to target these sensitive industries.

Timeline
In March 2021, Veritas published an advisory reporting three critical vulnerabilities in
Veritas Backup Exec 16.x, 20.x and 21.x.
On September 23, 2022, a METASPLOIT module was released which exploits these
vulnerabilities and creates a session which the threat actor can use to interact with the
victim system.
On October 22, 2022, Mandiant first observed exploitation of the Veritas vulnerabilities
in the wild.

Attack Phases
Initial Compromise and Establish Foothold
In late 2022, UNC4466 gained access to an internet-exposed Windows server, running
Veritas Backup Exec version 21.0 using the Metasploit module
`exploit/multi/veritas/beagent_sha_auth_rce`. Shortly after, the Metasploit persistence
module was invoked to maintain persistent access to the system for the remainder of this
intrusion.

Internal Reconnaissance
After gaining access to the Veritas Backup Exec server, UNC4466 used Internet Explorer,
the browser installed by default on older Windows systems, to download Famatech’s
Advanced IP Scanner from its website, hxxps://download.advanced-ip-scanner[.]com. This
tool is capable of scanning individual IP addresses or IP address ranges for open ports, and
returns hostnames, operating system and hardware manufacturer information.
UNC4466 also made use of ADRecon to gather network, account, and host information in
the victim’s environment. When executed by a privileged domain account, ADRecon
generates several reports about the Active Directory environment, including the Trusts, Sites,
Subnets, password policies, user and computer account listings. These reports can be
generated in a variety of formats, including CSV, XML, JSON, and HTML.

Ingress Tool Transfer

2/11

UNC4466 made heavy use of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to
download additional tools such as LAZAGNE, LIGOLO, WINSW, RCLONE, and finally the
ALPHV ransomware encryptor.

Command and Control
UNC4466 leveraged SOCKS5 tunneling to communicate with compromised systems in the
victim network. This technique is typically used to evade network defenses or other
preventative network controls. Two separate tools were deployed to execute this technique,
LIGOLO and REVSOCKS.

Escalate Privileges
The threat actor utilized multiple credential access tools, including Mimikatz, LaZagne and
Nanodump to gather clear-text credentials and credential material.
In November 2022, UNC4466 utilized the MIMIKATZ Security Support Provider injection
module (`MISC::MemSSP`). This module collects credentials in clear text as they are used,
by manipulating the Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) on victim systems. This
module creates a file named `C:\Windows\System32\mimilsa.log`.

[Nanodump] was also used to dump LSASS memory. Like the examples shown on
Helpsystems' GitHub page, the output file specified was a file in the `C:\Windows\Temp`
directory.

Defense Evasion
During operations, UNC4466 takes steps to evade detection. Apart from clearing event logs,
UNC4466 also used the built in Set-MpPrefernce cmdlet to disable Microsoft Defender’s realtime monitoring capability.

powershell.exe Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring 1 -ErrorAction
SilentlyContinue

Command and Control
UNC4466 made use of BITS transfers (using the Start-BitsTransfer PowerShell cmdlet) to
download various resources to the staging directory `c:\ProgramData`. Using this technique,
SOCKS5 tunneling tools, REVSOCKS and LIGOLO were downloaded from their official
GitHub repositories.

Complete Mission
UNC4466 deploys the Rust-based ALPHV ransomware. In Late 2022, UNC4466 added
immediate tasks to the default domain policy. These tasks were configured to perform
actions which disabled security software, downloaded the ALPHV encryptor, then execute it.

Exposure
As of this blog post's date, one commercial Internet scanning service reported over 8500 IP
addresses which advertise the "Symantec/Veritas Backup Exec ndmp" service on the default
port 10000, as well as port 9000 and port 10001. While this search result does not directly
identify vulnerable systems, as the application versions were not identifiable, it demonstrates
the prevalence of Internet exposed instances that could potentially be probed by attackers.

Detection Opportunities
Defenders should place priority on monitoring internet-exposed Veritas Backup Exec
Windows installations, for versions before 21.2. Mandiant observed the exploitation of Veritas
Backup Exec can leave a noticeable imprint on the Backup Exec log files. Where feasible,
these log files should be forwarded to a SIEM or similar technology which enables detection
and alerting when certain events are recorded.
In addition to any available network connection logging, Veritas Backup Exec logs will record
evidence of connections to remote systems.

Outlook
Mandiant recommends implementing secure access controls, segmenting networks,
enabling multi-factor authentication, and regularly testing and evaluating backup strategies to
limit the impact of a ransomware attack. Additionally, organizations should inventory
externally facing services and reduce the attack surface available to attackers.
