Introduction
Since 2019, threat actor Monster Libra (also known as TA551 or Shathak) has pushed
different families of malware. During the past few months, Monster Libra has primarily
pushed SVCready or IcedID. Today's diary reviews an example of Monster Libra pushing
IcedID on Thursday 2022-08-11, and that IcedID infection led to Dark VNC activity and
Cobalt Strike.

Final Words

IcedID continues to be an active malware in our current threat landscape. Threat actors like
Monster Libra continue to push IcedID through malspam-based campaigns as described in
this diary. We expect to find more of this activity in the coming weeks.
