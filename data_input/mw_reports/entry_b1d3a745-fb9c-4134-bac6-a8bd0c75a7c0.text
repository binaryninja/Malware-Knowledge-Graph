North Korea Targeted South Korean
Cryptocurrency Users and Exchange in
Late 2017 Campaign

Executive Summary
North Korea continued to target South Korea through late 2017 with a spear phishing
campaign against both cryptocurrency users and exchanges, as well as South Korean
college students interested in foreign affairs. The malware in this campaign utilizes a
known Ghostscript exploit (CVE-2017-8291— I​ ntel Card​) and is tailored to target only users
of a Korean language word processor, Hancom’s Hangul Word Processor.
Key Judgments

●
●

●

North Korean government actors, specifically Lazarus Group (​Intel Card​), continued
to target South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges and users in late 2017, before K
​ im
Jong Un’s New Year’s speech​ and subsequent N
​ orth-South dialogue​.
This campaign also targeted South Korean college students interested in foreign
affairs and part of a group called “Friends of MOFA” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs).
The malware employed shared code with Destover malware (​Intel Card​), which was
used against S
​ ony Pictures Entertainment​ in 2014 and the f​ irst WannaCry victim​ in
February 2017.
The dropper in this campaign exploited a known Ghostscript vulnerability,
CVE-2017-8291​. The exploit implementation includes Chinese terms possibly
signifying an attempted false flag or a Chinese exploit supplier.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

North Korean state-sponsored cyber operations are largely clustered within the Lazarus
Group (​Intel Card​) umbrella. Also known as H
​ IDDEN COBRA​ by the U.S. government,
Lazarus Group has conducted operations since at least 2009, when they launched a D
​ DoS
attack on U
​ .S. and South Korean websites​ utilizing the MYDOOM worm. Until 2015, Lazarus
Group ​cyber activities​ primarily focused on South Korean and U.S. ​governments​ and
financial organizations​, including destructive attacks on South Korean banking and m
​ edia
sectors in 2013 and the ​highly publicized attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment​ in 2014.
Beginning in 2016, researchers discovered a shift in North Korean operations toward
attacks against financial institutions​ designed to steal money and generate funds for the
Kim regime.

By 2017, North Korean actors had jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. The first
known North Korean cryptocurrency operation occurred in February 2017, with ​the theft of
$7 million​ (​at the time​) in cryptocurrency from South Korean exchange B
​ ithumb​. By the end
of 2017, several researchers had reported additional ​spear phishing​ ​campaigns​ against
South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, numerous ​successful thefts​, and even ​Bitcoin​ and
Monero​ mining. North Korea also utilized Bitcoin for the global ​WannaCry ransomware
attack​ in mid-May, forcing victims to pay ransom in Bitcoin.
Threat Analysis
Insikt Group researchers regularly follow North Korean threat actors through a variety of
methods, one of which includes proactive monitoring of attack vectors based on software
disproportionately adopted in South Korea. Using this methodology, we identified a recent
Lazarus Group malware campaign, which likely began late Fall 2017. Lazarus Group

operations target a wide swath of countries and verticals, with a particular interest in South
Korean targets.
Recent reporting regarding North Korean attacks ​against cryptocurrency exchanges​ and
using Pyeongchang Olympics as a lure​ describe techniques that are unusual for the Lazarus
Group. These include leveraging PowerShell, HTA, JavaScript, and Python, none of which
are common in Lazarus operations over the last eight years. The campaign we discovered
showcases a
​ clear use of Lazarus TTPs​ to target cryptocurrency exchanges and social
institutions in South Korea.
This campaign leveraged four different lures and targeted Korean-speaking users of the
Hangul Word Processor (.hwp file extension), a Korean-language word processing program
utilized widely in South Korea. North Korean state-sponsored actors have used ​Hangul
exploits​ (CVE-2015-6585) and malicious .hwp files in the past, including during a p
​ hishing
campaign in early 2017​, to target South Korean users.
Beyond Korean-speaking HWP users, targets of this campaign appear to be users of the
Coinlink c​ ryptocurrency exchange, South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges at large (or at
least those that are hiring), and a group called “Friends of MOFA” (Ministry of Foreign
Affairs), which is a group of college students from around South Korea with “​ a keen interest
in foreign affairs.”

Payload shows two prompts from ​coinlink.co.kr​, the first tells the user their password is incorrect, the second asks for
their email address.

The first cryptocurrency-focused lure appears designed to obtain the emails and
passwords of users of ​Coinlink​, a cryptocurrency exchange run by the South Korean
electronic stock exchange ​KOSDAQ​.
The second and third appear to be resumes stolen from two actual South Korean computer
scientists, both with work experience at South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges.
The fourth document was lifted from a blog run by the South Korean group “Friends of
MOFA” detailing a Korean Day celebration in late September 2017 during which P
​ resident
Moon Jae-in spoke​ about the importance of the Korean diaspora and the upcoming ​Winter
Olympics in Pyeongchang​.

Technical Analysis
This campaign relies on a known Ghostscript exploit (​CVE-2017-8291​) that can be triggered
from within an embedded PostScript in a Hangul Word Processor document.

Timeline​ of CVE-2017-8291 exploitation.

Screenshot of the function names utilized in the PostScript.

Our initial finding focused on “로그인 오류.hwp“ or “Korean Day” lure, but once we created a
signature for the particular implementation of the PostScript, we found three additional
lure documents in a public malware repository tied together by the use of this exploit: two
CVs and a cryptocurrency exchange-themed lure. All were created in the span of a month
from mid-October to late November. Despite a nearly identical delivery mechanism (with
the exception of altered 4-byte XOR keys), the payloads (when recoverable) were different
in each case.

It’s worth noting that the function names used in the PostScript are transliterated
Chinese words. While “yima” (decode) and “yaoshi” (key) appear appropriate in their
functional context, the word “yinzi” (factor/money) does not. The latter may be
obscure technical slang or be a misuse signifying a potential false flag.

This would not be the first time the Lazarus Group used foreign-language terms to
misdirect attribution efforts; B
​ AE researchers discovered​ transliterated Russian terms in
previous Lazarus operations. However, an alternate explanation may point to a Chinese
exploit supplier or the language competency of the developer.
The attack chain occurs in multiple stages with the PostScript deobfuscating a first stage
shellcode that’s been XORed with a hardcoded four-byte key. The shellcode in turn triggers
the GhostScript vulnerability in order to execute an embedded DLL that has also been
XORed. A ​PwnCode.Club​ blogpost details the deobfuscation of the shellcode and loading of
the DLL into memory.
Lazarus malware families (like Hangman (​Intel Card​), Duuzer (​Intel Card​), Volgmer (​Intel
Card​), SpaSpe (​Intel Card​), etc.) overlap, likely as the result of the developers
cutting-and-splicing an extensive codebase of malicious functionality to generate payloads
as needed. This erratic composition make the Lazarus intrusion malware d
​ ifficult to identify
and group or cluster​, unless they are analyzed at the level of code similarity.
Upon deobfuscating the payloads, we found 32-bit DLLs built in part on the Destover
malware (​Intel Card​) code. Destover has been used in a number of North Korea-attributed
operations: most infamously against ​Sony Pictures Entertainment​ in 2014, the P
​ olish
banking attacks​ in January 2017, and the f​ irst WannaCry victim​ in February 2017.
This campaign relies on multiple payloads fashioned out of the Destover infostealer code
to collect information about the victim system and exfiltrate files. Each payload contains an
embedded 64-bit version of itself. The payloads accompanying the newer cryptocurrency
exchange-themed lure docs compiled a month after the Korean Day payload further
obfuscate their functionality by resolving imports at runtime.
This type of obfuscation is common in the Lazarus Hangman malware family. They also rely
entirely on IPs (rather than domains) for their command-and-control infrastructure, a tactic
likely borne of the use of hacked servers for infrastructure.
Outlook
This late 2017 campaign is a continuation of North Korea’s interest in cryptocurrency, which
we now know encompasses a broad range of activities including mining, ransomware, and

outright theft. Outside of the May WannaCry attack, the majority of North Korean
cryptocurrency operations have targeted South Korean users and exchanges, but we
expect this trend to change in 2018. We assess that as South Korea responds to these
attempted thefts by increasing security (and ​possibly banning cryptocurrency trading​) they
will become harder targets, forcing North Korean actors to look to exchanges and users in
other countries as well.
Further, while this campaign and toolset are specific to the Hangul Word Processor, the
vulnerability it exploited (​CVE-2017-8291​) is not. This vulnerability is for the Ghostscript
suite and affects a wide range of products, and while this particular version is triggered
from within an embedded PostScript in an HWP document, it could easily be adapted to
other software.
As South Korean exchanges harden their networks and the government imposes ​stricter
regulatory controls on cryptocurrencies​, exchanges and users in other countries should be
aware of the increased threat level from North Korean actors.
