Unit 42 researchers at Palo Alto Networks have discovered new attack activity targeting
individuals involved with United States defense contractors. Through analysis of malicious
code, files, and infrastructure it is clear the group behind this campaign is either directly
responsible for or has cooperated with the group which conducted Operation Blockbuster
Sequel and, ultimately, Operation Blockbuster (originally outlined by researchers from
Novetta). The threat actors are reusing tools, techniques, and procedures which overlap
throughout these operations with little variance. Attacks originating from this threat group
have not ceased since our previous report (from April of 2017) and have continued through
July of 2017.

New Activity
Recently, we’ve identified weaponized Microsoft Office Document files which use the same
malicious macros as attacks from earlier this year. Based on the contents of these latest
decoy documents which are displayed to a victim after opening the weaponized document
1/6

the attackers have switched targets from Korean language speakers to English language
speakers. Most notably, decoy document themes now include job role descriptions and
internal policies from US defense contractors.
The following image shows the content of one of the recent decoy documents
(de2d458c8e4befcd478a0010789d80997793790b18a347d10a595d6e87d91f34). It is a job
description at a defense contractor.

The following images also shows the contents of a recent decoy document
(062aadf3eb69686f4881860d88ce472e6b1c07e1f586d840dd2ee1f7b76cabe7). It contains
an exact copy of a publicly available job description, including typos, at a US defense
contractor.

2/6

The weaponized documents have been hosted on systems which we believe have likely
been compromised and repurposed. Two of the URL paths used to host the weaponized
documents on the compromised systems are exact matches
(event/careers/jobs/description/docs). The payloads delivered by the weaponized documents
are extremely similar to the payloads delivered by weaponized documents detailed in our
April 2017 report on the threat group's activity.
For a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between samples and
infrastructure used in the recent activity see the following network graph.

3/6

The document metadata Author "ISkyISea" is used across multiple weaponized document
files. IPv4 addresses (210.202.40[.]35) hosting the weaponized documents have also been
hardcoded as command and control servers for previous samples
(16c3a7f143e831dd0481d2d57aae885090e22ec55cc8282009f641755d423fcd).

Ties to Blockbuster
The source code used in the macros embedded in the weaponized documents described
above was also detailed in a previous report where it was included in testing documents
uploaded to VirusTotal. This reuse of macro source code, XOR keys used within the macro to
decode implant payloads, and the functional overlap in the payloads the macros write to disk
demonstrates the continued use of this tool set by this threat group. The use of an
automated tool to build the weaponized documents would explain the common but not
consistent reuse of metadata, payloads, and XOR keys within the documents.
Other similarities between the previously reported activity and this new activity can be seen
within the PE payloads written to disk by the malicious documents. The payloads function
similarly to other implants associated with this threat group. The use of a fake TLS
communications protocol, encoded strings within samples, filenames and contents of batch
4/6

files embedded within implants, as well implants beaconing directly to IPv4 addresses (and
not resolving domains for command and control) are all known techniques associated with
the threat group. These tactics have changed very little since the original Operation
Blockbuster.
In addition to tool reuse, infrastructure overlaps also exist. URLs used for hosting the
malicious documents and IPv4 addresses used for command and control overlap with
infrastructure previously used by the group.

Final Thoughts
The techniques and tactics the group uses have changed little in recent attacks. Tool and
infrastructure overlaps with previous campaigns are apparent. Given that the threat actors
have continued operations despite their discovery and public exposure it is likely they will
continue to operate and launch targeted campaigns.
Palo Alto Networks researchers will continue to monitor this group’s activities and stay
abreast to additional attacks using this tool set.
The malicious files describe in this report are flagged as malicious by WildFire and in
Threat Prevention.
