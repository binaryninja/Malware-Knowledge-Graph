Egregor Ransomware Targets Businesses
Worldwide, Attempting to Extort Businesses
by Publicly Releasing Exfiltrated Data
Summary
The FBI first observed Egregor ransomware in September 2020. To
date, the threat actors behind this ransomware variant claim to have
compromised over 150 victims worldwide. Once a victim company’s
network is compromised, Egregor actors exfiltrate data and encrypt
files on the network. The ransomware leaves a ransom note on
machines instructing the victim to communicate with the threat actors
via an online chat. Egregor actors often utilize the print function on
victim machines to print ransom notes. The threat actors then demand
a ransom payment for the return of exfiltrated files and decryption of
the network. If the victim refuses to pay, Egregor publishes victim data
to a public site.

Threat Overview
The FBI assesses Egregor ransomware is operating as a Ransomware as a Service Model. In this model,
multiple different individuals play a part in conducting a single intrusion and ransomware event. Because of
the large number of actors involved in deploying Egregor, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
used in its deployment can vary widely, creating significant challenges for defense and mitigation.
Egregor ransomware utilizes multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, including targeting
business network and employee personal accounts that share access with business networks or devices.
Egregor ransomware may use phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain access to network
accounts. Egregor can also exploit Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Private Networks to gain
access. Adversaries may also leverage Egregor’s RDP exploitation capability to laterally move inside
networks.
Once Egregor gains access to the network, Egregor ransomware affiliates use common pen testing and
exploit tools like Cobalt Strike, Qakbot/Qbot, Advanced IP Scanner, and AdFind to escalate privileges and
move laterally across a network, and tools like Rclone (sometimes renamed or hidden as svchost) and 7zip
to exfiltrate data.
The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom emboldens adversaries to
target additional organizations, encourages other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of
ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s
files will be recovered. However, the FBI understands that when businesses are faced with an inability to
function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers.
Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to
report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office. Doing so provides the FBI with the critical
information they need to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and
holding them accountable under US law.

Prioritize patching of public-facing remote access products and applications, including
recent RDP vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-0609, CVE-2020-0610, CVE-2020-16896, CVE-20191489, CVE-2019-1225, CVE-2019-1224, CVE-2019-1108).
Review suspicious .bat and .dll files, files with recon data (such as .log files), and exfiltration
tools.
Securely configure RDP by restricting access, using multi-factor authentication or strong
passwords.
