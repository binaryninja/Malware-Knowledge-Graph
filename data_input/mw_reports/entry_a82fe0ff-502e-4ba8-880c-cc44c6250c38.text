Overall Damage to Banks, Merchants, Card Companies, and
Consumers Estimated at More than $1 Billion
A Ukrainian national was sentenced today in the Western District of Washington to seven
years in prison for his role in the criminal work of the hacking group FIN7. The defendant was
also ordered by the court to pay restitution in the amount of $2,500,000.
According to documents filed in the case, statements made at the sentencing, and public
documents, Andrii Kolpakov, 33, who has used a number of different names, served as a
high-level hacker, whom the group referred to as a “pen tester,” for FIN7. He was arrested in
Lepe, Spain, on June 28, 2018, at the request of U.S. law enforcement and was extradited to
the United States on June 1, 2019. In June 2020, he pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.

According to public documents, since at least 2015, members of FIN7 (also referred to as
Carbanak Group and the Navigator Group, among other names) engaged in a highly
sophisticated malware campaign to attack hundreds of U.S. companies, predominantly in the
restaurant, gambling and hospitality industries. FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer
systems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers that were then used or
sold for profit. FIN7, through its dozens of members, launched waves of malicious
cyberattacks on numerous businesses operating in the United States and abroad. FIN7
carefully crafted email messages that would appear legitimate to a business’s employees
and accompanied emails with telephone calls intended to further legitimize the emails. Once
an attached file was opened and activated, FIN7 would use an adapted version of the
Carbanak malware, in addition to an arsenal of other tools, to access and steal payment card
data for the business’s customers. Since 2015, many of the stolen payment card numbers
have been offered for sale through online underground marketplaces.
In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of businesses
in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 20 million customer card
records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate
business locations. According to court documents, victims incurred enormous costs that,
according to some estimates, exceeded $1 billion. Additional intrusions occurred abroad,
including in the United Kingdom, Australia and France. Companies that have publicly
disclosed hacks attributable to FIN7 include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chili’s, Arby’s, Red Robin
and Jason’s Deli.
Kolpakov was involved with FIN7 from at least April 2016 until his arrest in June 2018. He
also managed other hackers tasked with breaching the security of victims’ computer
systems. During the course of the scheme, Kolpakov received compensation for his
participation in FIN7, which far exceeded comparable legitimate employment in Ukraine.
Moreover, FIN7 members, including Kolpakov, were aware of reported arrests of other FIN7
members, but nevertheless continued to attack U.S. businesses.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal
Division; Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman for the Western District of Washington; and
Special Agent in Charge Donald M. Voiret of the FBI’s Seattle Field Office made the
announcement.
This case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Seattle Cyber Task Force of the
FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department’s Office of International
Affairs, the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, numerous computer security
firms and financial institutions, FBI offices across the nation and globe, as well as a number
of international agencies provided significant assistance. Spanish law enforcement
authorities provided significant assistance by arresting Kolpakov.
