Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of
(FBI). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government. This malw
been identified as KEYMARBLE. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. F
information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use
administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integra
(NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This malware report contains analysis of one 32-bit Windows executable file, identified as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). This malware is capab
device configuration data, downloading additional files, executing commands, modifying the registry, capturing screen shots, and exfiltrating data.

Description

This application is a malicious 32-bit Windows executable file, which functions as a RAT. When executed, it de-obfuscates its application program
(APIs) and using port 443, attempts to connect to the hard-coded IP addresses listed below. After connecting, the malware waits for further instruc
--Begin hard-coded IP addresses-100.43.153.60
104.194.160.59
212.143.21.43
--End hard-coded IP addresses-2/5

Static analysis reveals that this RAT uses a customized XOR cryptographic algorithm displayed in Figure 1 to secure its data transfers and comm
(C2) sessions. It is designed to accept instructions from the remote server to perform the following functions:
--Begin functions-Download and upload files
Execute secondary payloads
Execute shell commands
Terminate running processes
Delete files
Search files
Set file attributes
Create registry entries for storing data:(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WABE\DataPath)
Collect device information from installed storage devices (disk free space and their type)
List running processes information
Capture screenshots
Collect and send information about the victim's system (operating system, CPU, MAC address, computer name, language settings, list of disk dev
type, time elapsed since the system was started, and unique identifier of the victim's system)
--End functions-Screenshots

Recommendations
NCCIC would like to remind users and administrators to consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their orga
systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumbdrives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate ACLs.
