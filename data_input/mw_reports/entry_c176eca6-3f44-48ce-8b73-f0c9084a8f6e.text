Avaddon is a cryptolocker ransomware written in C++ that is best known for encrypting files
and changing the file extension to .avdn. The ransomware also deletes the volume shadow
copies and other system backups and typically demands a ransom ranging between $150
and $900. Since the ransomware uses strong encryption algorithms like AES256 and
RSA2048, no decryptor is available and it is impossible to decrypt the file without the key that
was used to encrypt it. This ransomware is sold similar to other Ransomware-as-a1/5

service(RaaS) like REvil. Thus, even someone with limited technical background can
become an “affiliate” to spread the malware. In return, the profit gets shared between the
threat actor and the affiliate. In this blog post we dissect this malware and discuss methods
to perform threat hunting for the Avaddon ransomware family.
Understanding and Hunting for Avaddon
The Avaddon malware campaign began in early June 2020. The malware is delivered and
spreads mainly using phishing emails containing a malicious attachment. The email contains
what appears to be a zipped image attachment named in the format of IMG <random-6digits>.jpg.js. However, as you will notice the attachment is actually a JavaScript file. Since
operating systems often hide file extensions of common file formats, the threat actor
attempts to deceive the viewer into thinking the JavaScript file is actually an image..

Executing this JavaScript file results in the download of the Avaddon ransomware from an
external C2 server, through a combination of PowerShell and the BITS admin tool (Indicator
#1).

The ransomware does not perform much command and control (C2) communication.
However, as soon as the binary is executed, it connects to https://api.myip.com to get the
external IP address of the victim machine(Indicator #2).

Threat Hunting for Avaddon
Security analysts can hunt for Avaddon download attempts by correlating and detecting the
pattern of phishing email activity along with binary download using PowerShell and BITS
admin that we describe above.
In fact, the Awake Security Platform identifies this sequence of actions and surfaces the
malicious behavior on the network (similar to MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1566, T1197). The
platform then creates a graphical visualization of the attack Situation as shown in Figure 5
below, demonstrating that a Windows device is accessing gmail.com and an IP address,
which in this case is the Avaddon C2 server.

Remediation
It is recommended to backup all important data to external drives or in the cloud for better
security. It is advised not to screen all email and refrain from opening any attachment from
unknown sources. Finally, identify the sequence and patterns of communication we describe
here to uncover the presence of Avaddon on your network.
