The ASEC analysis team has recently discovered that Vidar is exploiting a social media
platform named Mastodon to create C&C server addresses.

Mastodon website
Vidar is an info-stealer malware installed through spam emails and PUP, sometimes being
disguised as a KMSAuto authenticator tool. It has been consistently distributed since the
past, and there was a recent case of it being installed through other types of malware such
as Stop ransomware. When Vidar is run, it first accesses the C&C server to receive
commands and DLLs that are required to steal information before it can perform its infostealing activities. In the past, the malware simply connected to C&C server and received
commands and additional files like other malware. Yet the recent Vidar type exploits various
online platforms to actually create C&C servers.
Last year, it used a game matching platform called FaceIt to do so, which was discussed in
one of the ASEC blog posts.
Vidar Info-Stealer Abusing Certain Game Platform
Recent Vidar cases exploit Mastodon, a social media platform. When Vidar is run, it first
accesses Mastodon (noc.social website) before it tries to communicate with the C&C server.
To be more specific, it is a profile page of a user named “banda5ker”.

Attacker’s Mastodon profile
The profile page has the string shown below. It is the actual C&C server address of Vidar.
“hello 162.55.213[.]180|”
The malware downloads the web page and searches the “hello” string, parsing the C&C
address existing between the separator “|”.

Routine for C&C address parsing
If the attacker edits the profile part and enters another address, the Vidar info-stealer will
connect to the changed C&C server and continue to perform malicious activities. If
Mastodon’s attacker account is not blocked, the attacker can repeatedly edit the C&C server
to make the same malware connect to different C&C servers. It is likely that the attacker is
using the method to bypass network detection for the C&C address.

Vidar connects to the actual C&C servers established and receives DLL files needed for
commands and info-stealing, and ultimately sends the stolen information to the C&C server.
Note that Vidar’s version is v49.6 (see figure of data sent below). The version of the Vidar
strain which exploited FaceIt was v38.6.
