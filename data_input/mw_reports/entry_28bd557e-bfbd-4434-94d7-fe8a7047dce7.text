The financial malware landscape is constantly evolving, cybercriminals are becoming more
knowledgeable about the financial sector, and attacks are becoming more sophisticated.
We’ve recently released a report, “The World of Financial Trojans,” describing the different
features and techniques used by banking malware. It would seem that the choices made
by the malware authors concerning these techniques and features depend on the
cybercriminals’ financial resources and market knowledge.
In most cases financial malware favors exploit kits as their infection vector. In the past few
months we have been actively monitoring an exploit kit, called Gongda, which is mainly
targeting South Korea. Interestingly, we have come across a piece of malware, known as
Castov, being delivered by this exploit kit that targets specific South Korean financial
companies and their customers. The cybercriminals in this case have done their research
on the South Korean online financial landscape.

Korea)
The initial stage of this threat is Downloader.Castov and is compiled in Delphi with the
ability to stop antivrius software which, once inside a computer, will report the infection to
its command-and-control (C&C) server and download an encrypted file that is the second
stage.
The second stage is Infostealer.Castov. The infostealer checks at specific offsets in a list
of clean DLLs (all related to Korean online banking software and security) for opcode
instructions and then patches those instructions. The injected code checks strings that
appear to be passwords, account details, and transactions. Once the data is found and
collected, it will be sent to a remote server.

Additionally, the infostealer collects the digital certificates stored in the compromised
computer’s NPKI directory (%ProgramFiles%\NPKI). Those digital certificates are widely
used in South Korea and are issued for financial general purposes (individual/corporate)
such as banking, credit card, insurance etc. They are unique to each user and are valid for
one year.
The combination of screenshots, passwords, and digital certificates will allow the
cybercriminals to access users’ financial accounts.
