A new botnet known publicly as “solarbot” has been making its rounds, according to a report
from ESET.

In their writeup, ESET analysts explain that solarbot(which they refer to as Win32/Napolar) is
capable of:
Denial of Service (DOS) attacks
Behave as a SOCKS proxy server
Stealing information from web forms
Amongst the tricks employed by this bot, one in particular is self-debugging, something we
mentioned here and by avast! here. The bot begins execution by unraveling code encrypted
with RC4 within Thread Local Storage (TLS) callback functions. To find the starting location of
the decrypted code, it searches for the PUSH EBP assembly instruction, which is 0x55.
This is a smart approach as most reverse engineers will place a software breakpoint at this
location to begin executing the decrypted code. However, whenever a software breakpoint is
placed, the instruction is actually replaced with an INT3 (0xCC), and therefore the malware
wouldn’t continue to execute as intended. Pretty slick.

It’s currently undetermined how the bot spreads, but researchers at ESET believe it’s likely
spread through Facebook, based on its ability to steal login credentials.
In addition, the bot’s creator had been publicly advertising the malware on the web, before the
site was taken down just recently. The bot supports multiple plugins (must be written in Delphi),
and even makes some references to TOR configuration files.
TOR has seen a lot of publicity lately, after a sudden surge in traffic occured earlier this month,
believed to be caused by the Mevade/SBC botnet. Perhaps we will see even more malware use
TOR to route traffic to C2 servers in the coming future.
We’ll continue to keep you updated with any unique findings on the solarbot malware. As a
closing note, users of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware are protected from known solarbot variants,
detected as Malware.Packer.SB.
