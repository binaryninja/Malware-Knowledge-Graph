The RobbinHood Ransomware is the latest player in the ransomware scene that is targeting
companies and the computers on their network. This ransomware is not being distributed
through spam but rather through other methods, which could include hacked remote
desktop services or other Trojans that provide access to the attackers.
Since it first came out, samples of the RobbinHood ransomware have not been easy to
come by. Yesterday, though, MalwareHunterTeam was able to find a sample so that it could
be reverse engineered and tested to learn more about it.

Taking a look at RobbinHood
As we previously stated, it has not been confirmed how the ransomware gains access to a
network and the computer's on it.
Security researcher Vitali Kremez, who reverse engineered the sample, told
BleepingComputer that on execution, RobbinHood disconnects all network shares from the
computer using the following command:
cmd.exe /c net use * /DELETE /Y

1/12

This means that each computer is targeted individually and that other computers are not
encrypted via connected shares. Kremez told us that this could indicate that the payload is
being pushed to each individual machine via a domain controller or through a framework
like Empire PowerShell and PSExec.
"One of the most notable ones is "cmd.exe /c net use * /DELETE /Y" since the malware
does not encrypt or crawl any shares and actually disconnects from network, which
indicates each variant is likely pushed into each machine via the domain controller or some
other automated means (maybe via psexec)"
Before continuing, the ransomware will now attempt to read a public RSA encryption key
from C:\Windows\Temp\pub.key. If this key is not present, it will display the following
message and the ransomware will exit.

Can't find pub.key error
If a key is present, it will continue preparing the victim's computer for encryption. To test the
ransomware, BleepingComputer generated a test public key and saved it to
C:\Windows\Temp.
Next it will stop 181 Windows services associated with antivirus, database, mail server, and
other software that could keep files open and prevent their encryption. It does this by
issuing the "sc.exe stop" command as shown below.
cmd.exe /c sc.exe stop AVP /y

A full list of services stopped by RobbinHood are found at the end of the article.
During this preparation stage, RobbinHood will also clear Shadow Volume Copies, clear
event logs, and disable the Windows automatic repair by executing the following
commands:
2/12

vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet
WMIC shadowcopy delete
wevtutil.exe cl Application
wevtutil.exe cl Security
wevtutil.exe cl System
Bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no
Bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures

Now that the computer is prepped, it begins to encrypt the victim's targeted files.
Kremez told BleepingComputer that when encrypting files an AES key is created for each
file. The ransomware will then encrypt the AES key and the original filename with the public
RSA encryption key and append it to the encrypted file.
Each encrypted file will then be renamed using the format
Encrypted_[randomstring].enc_robbinhood as shown below.

Encrypted RobbinHood Files
When encrypting files, RobbinHood will skip any files found in or under the following
directories:

3/12

ProgramData
Windows
bootmgr
Boot
$WINDOWS.~BT
Windows.old
Temp
tmp
Program Files
Program Files (x86)
AppData
$Recycle.bin
System Volume Information

While running, RobbinHood has the ability to send debug output to the console. This feature
is currently disabled in distributed versions of the ransomware and does not have a runtime
value to enable it.
The ransomware will, though, create numerous log files under the C:\Windows\Temp folder.
These files are called rf_, ro_l, and ro_s.

Log Files
It is not currently known what each log file is for other than the rf_s file, which is used to log
the creation of ransom notes in each folder.

Example logfile for RobbinHood ransom note creation
After encryption has been completed, these log files will be deleted. Below is an example
of some of the debug messages that would be displayed during this cleanup stage if
console output was enabled.

Cleaning up Logs
Furthermore, if console output is enabled in the ransomware, when done encrypting a
computer it will display a final message stating "Enjoy buddy :)))" as shown below.

5/12

Final message when RobbinHood is done encrypting
While encrypting the computer it will also create four different ransom note
named _Decrypt_Files.html, _Decryption_ReadMe.html, _Help_Help_Help.html, and
_Help_Important.html.
These ransom notes contains information as to what has happened to the victims files and
a bitcoin address that they can use to make a ransom payment. The ransom payments are
currently set at 3 bitcoins per affected system or 13 bitcoins for the entire network.

RobbinHood Ransom Note
Unfortunately, at this time no weakness has been found in the ransomware and there is no
way to decrypt files for free.

Protecting yourself from the RobbinHood Ransomware

6/12

As ransomware is only damaging if you have no way of recovering your data, the most
important thing is to always have a reliable backup of your files. These backups should be
stored offline and not made accessible to ransomware, which have been known to target
backups in the past.
While this ransomware is not being spread via spam, it is possible that it is being installed
by Trojans that are. Therefore, it is important that all users be trained on how to properly
identify malicious spam and to not open any attachments without first confirming who and
why they were sent.
Finally, it also important to make sure that your network does not make Remote Desktop
Services publicly accessible via the Internet. Instead, you should put it behind a firewall and
make it only accessible through a VPN.

What happened to your files?
All your files are encrypted with RSA-4096, Read more on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)
RSA is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt the data. RSA is
an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different
keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be
given to anyone:
1 - We encrypted your files with our "Public key"
2 - You can decrypt, the encrypted files with specific "Private key" and your
private key is in our hands ( It's not possible to recover your files without our
private key )
Is it possible to get back your data?
Yes, We have a decrypter with all your private keys. We have two options to get all
your data back.
Follow the instructions to get all your data back:
OPTION 1
Step 1 : You must send us 3 Bitcoin(s) for each affected system
Step 2 : Inform us in panel with hostname(s) of the system you want, wait for
confirmation and get your decrypter
OPTION 2
Step 1 : You must send us 13 Bitcoin(s) for all affected system
Step 2 : Inform us in panel, wait for confirmation and get all your decrypters
Our Bitcoin address is: xxx
BE CAREFUL, THE COST OF YOUR PAYMENT INCREASES $10,000 EACH DAY AFTER THE FOURTH DAY
Access to the panel ( Contact us )
The panel address: http://xbt4titax4pzza6w.onion/xx/
Alternative addresses
https://xbt4titax4pzza6w.onion.pet/xx/
https://xbt4titax4pzza6w.onion.to/xx/
Access to the panel using Tor Browser
If non of our links are accessible you can try tor browser to get in touch with us:
Step 1: Download Tor Browser from here:
https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en
Step 2: Run Tor Browser and wait to connect
Step 3: Visit our website at: panel address
If you're having a problem with using Tor Browser, Ask Google: how to use tor
browser
Wants to make sure we have your decrypter?
To make sure we have your decrypter you can upload at most 3 files (maximum size
allowance is 10 MB in total) and get your data back as a demo.
Where to buy Bitcoin?
The easiest way is LocalBitcoins, but you can find more websites to buy bitcoin
using Google Search: buy bitcoin online

Thanks for the details!
If we look closely at antivirus detections on VT, we will notice that almost all of
antiviruses write the word Robin with one letter 'B'. But the extortionists decided to
write it with two letters 'B'. This should be a funny. But there are two more
Ransomware named RobinHood, which were before.

Yes, writing it with one B is incorrect and companies should stop doing it.

Iconera - 3 years ago

Great analysis. Have you tried making a read only folder C:\Windows\Temp\pub.key
which will prevent the file of the same name being created to see if that is a
preventitive method on clean systems

11/12

Lawrence Abrams - 3 years ago

No, but those types of tricks last only as long as the developer doesn't know about it.
As these are targeted installs, the dev will prob notice something is amiss and work
around it.
