The master decryption keys for the Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet ransomware operations
were released last night on the BleepingComputer forums by the alleged malware
developer.
The Maze ransomware began operating in May 2019 and quickly rose to fame as they
were responsible for the use of data theft and double-extortion tactics now used by many
ransomware operations.
After Maze announced its shutdown in October 2020, they rebranded in September as
Egregor, who later disappeared after members were arrested in Ukraine.
The Sekhmet operation was somewhat of an outlier as it launched in March 2020, while
Maze was still active.

Master decryption keys released
Fast forward 14 months later, and the decryption keys for these operations have now been
leaked in the BleepingComputer forums by a user named 'Topleak' who claims to be the
developer for all three operations.
The poster said that this was a planned leak and is not related to recent law enforcement
operations that have led to the seizing of servers and the arrests of ransomware affiliates.
"Since it will raise too much clues and most of them will be false, it is necessary to
emphasize that it is planned leak, and have no any connections to recent arrests and
takedowns," explained the alleged ransomware developer.
They further stated that none of their team members will ever return to ransomware and
that they destroyed all of the source code for their ransomware.

The post includes a download link for a 7zip file with four archives containing the Maze,
Egregor, and Sekhmet decryption keys, and the source code for a 'M0yv' malware used by
the ransomware gang.

Each of these archives contains the public master encryption key and the private master
decryption key associated with a specific "advert", or affiliate of the ransomware operation.
In total, the following are the number of RSA-2048 master decryption keys released per
ransomware operation:
Maze: 9 master decryption keys for the original malware that targeted non-corporate
users.
Maze: 30 master decryption keys.
Egregor: 19 master decryption keys.
Sekhmet: 1 master decryption key.
Emsisoft's Michael Gillespie and Fabian Wosar has reviewed the decryption keys and
confirmed to BleepingComputer that they are legitimate and can be used to decrypt files
encrypted by the three ransomware families.
Gillespie told us that the keys are used to decrypt a victim's encrypted keys that are
embedded in a ransom note.

Emsisoft has released a decryptor to allow any Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet victims who
have been waiting to recover their files for free.

To use the decryptor, victims will need ransom note created during the attack as it contains
the encrypted decryption key.

Bonus M0yv malware source code

The archive also includes the source code for the M0yv 'modular x86/x64 file infector'
developed by the Maze ransomware operation and used previously in attacks.
"Also there is a little bit harmless source code of polymorphic x86/x64 modular EPO file
infector m0yv detected in the wild as Win64/Expiro virus, but it is not expiro actually, but AV
engines detect it like this, so no single thing in common with gazavat," the ransomware
developer said in the forum post.
"M0yv source is a bonus, because there was no any major source code of resident software
for years now, so here we go," the developer later explained.
This source code come in the form of a Microsoft Visual Studio project and includes some
already compiled DLLs.

19th, 2022.

Awww bless his heart. What a kind and caring criminal he is.

A smart criminal knows when it's time to cash in and walk away. Releasing the keys
wasn't necessary, I'm glad that many will be able to get their files back now.
