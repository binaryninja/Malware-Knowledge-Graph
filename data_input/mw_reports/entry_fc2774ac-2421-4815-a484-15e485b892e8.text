Infamous Hacker-for-Hire Group DeathStalker Hits the Americas & Europe With New
PowerPepper Malware
December 03, 2020
Woburn, MA – December 3, 2020 – Kaspersky researchers have spotted new malware
activity in the wild from DeathStalker, the advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known for
offering hacking-for-hire services targeting companies in the financial and legal sectors. The
group was found using a new malware implant and delivery tactics involving a backdoor
Kaspersky has dubbed PowerPepper.
The backdoor is used to remotely take control of victim devices. It leverages DNS over
HTTPS as a communication channel, in order to hide communications with the control server
behind legitimate-looking traffic. PowerPepper also uses several evasion techniques,
including steganography, a method for disguising data.

DeathStalker is a highly unusual APT actor. Active since at least 2012, the group conducts
espionage campaigns against small and medium-sized businesses, particularly law firms and
financial services organizations. Unlike other APT groups, it doesn’t appear to be politically
motivated or seek financial gain from the companies they target. Rather, they act as
mercenaries, offering their hacking services for a price.
Kaspersky researchers have recently uncovered new malicious campaigns from
DeathStalker. Like other malware strains associated with the group, PowerPepper is
typically spread via spearphishing emails with the malicious files delivered via the email body
or within a malicious link. The group has exploited international events, carbon emission
regulations, and even the pandemic to trick their victims into opening the malicious
documents.
The main malicious payload is disguised using steganography, a process that allows
attackers to hide data amid legitimate content. In the case of PowerPepper, the malicious
code is embedded in what appears to be regular pictures of ferns or peppers (hence the
name) and is then extracted by a loader script. Once that happens, PowerPepper begins to
execute remote shell commands sent by DeathStalker operators, which are aimed at stealing
sensitive business information. The malware can carry out any shell command on the
targeted system, including those for standard data reconnaissance, such as gathering the
computer’s user and file information, browsing network file shares, and downloading
additional binaries or copy content to remote locations. The commands are obtained from the
control server though DNS over HTTPS communications, an effective way to disguise
malicious communications behind legitimate server name queries.
The use of steganography is just one of several obfuscation and evasion techniques
employed by the malware. The loader is disguised as a verification tool from identity services
provider GlobalSign. It uses custom obfuscation, and parts of the malicious delivery scripts
are hidden in Word-embedded objects. Communications with the implant and servers are
encrypted and, thanks to the use of trusted, signed scripts, antivirus software won’t
necessarily recognize the implant as malicious at startup.
PowerPepper has been seen in attacks across Europe primarily, but also in the Americas
and Asia. In previously described campaigns, DeathStalker mainly targeted law consultancy
firms and organizations that provide financial or cryptocurrency services.
“PowerPepper once again proves that DeathStalker is a creative threat actor: one capable of
consistently developing new implants and toolchains in a short period of time,” said Pierre
Delcher, security expert at Kaspersky. “PowerPepper is already the fourth malware strain
affiliated with the actor, and we have discovered a potential fifth strain. Even though they are
not particularly sophisticated, DeathStalker’s malware has proven to be quite effective,
perhaps because their primary targets are small and medium-sized organizations—
organizations that tend to have less robust security programs. We expect DeathStalker to
remain active, and we will continue to monitor its campaigns.”

To protect your organizations from attacks like PowerPepper, Kaspersky experts
recommend:
Provide your SOC team with access to the latest threat intelligence (TI). The Kaspersky
Threat Intelligence Portal is a single point of access for the company’s TI, providing
cyberattack data and insights gathered by Kaspersky over more than 20 years.
To minimize the risk of infection through phishing emails, companies should educate
their employees with basic cybersecurity hygiene training to be wary of emails from
unknown senders. If they receive such letters, they shouldn’t open attachments or click
any links in them before making sure the letter is legitimate.
To protect medium-sized businesses from such advanced attacks, it’s better to use
endpoint security solutions with EDR functionality. Kaspersky’s Integrated Endpoint
Security solution detects an attack and provides a wide range of response actions
optimized for IT and security teams of mid-sized companies.
