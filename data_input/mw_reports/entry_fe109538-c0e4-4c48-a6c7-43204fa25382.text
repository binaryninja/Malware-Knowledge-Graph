UPDATE July 13, 20201: We've provided additional indicators of compromise (IOCs)
below. You can also find additional details on the threat actor and their findings in a
blog post from Microsoft.
UPDATE July 10, 2021: NOTE: This security vulnerability only affects Serv-U Managed
File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP and does not affect any other SolarWinds or Nable (formerly SolarWinds MSP) products.
SolarWinds was recently notified by Microsoft of a security vulnerability related to Serv-U
Managed File Transfer Server and Serv-U Secured FTP and have developed a hotfix to
resolve this vulnerability. While Microsoft’s research indicates this vulnerability exploit
involves a limited, targeted set of customers and a single threat actor, our joint teams have
mobilized to address it quickly.

1/10

The vulnerability exists in the latest Serv-U version 15.2.3 HF1 released May 5, 2021, and all
prior versions. A threat actor who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary
code with privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
run programs on the affected system.
Serv-U version 15.2.3 hotfix (HF) 2 has been released. Please see the Security Updates
table below for the applicable update for your system. We recommend you install these
updates immediately. If you are unable to install these updates, see the FAQ in this Security
Advisory for information on how to help protect your system from this vulnerability.
Additional details of the vulnerability will be published after giving customers sufficient time to
upgrade for the protection of their environments.

FAQ
What happened?

2/10

Microsoft reported to SolarWinds that they had discovered a remote code execution (RCE)
vulnerability in the SolarWinds Serv-U product. Microsoft provided a proof of concept of the
exploit. If exploited, a threat actor may be able to gain privileged access to the threat actor
on the machine hosting Serv-U.
To the best of our understanding, no other SolarWinds products have been affected by this
vulnerability.
Have SolarWinds customers been affected?
Microsoft has provided evidence of limited, targeted customer impact, though SolarWinds
does not currently have an estimate of how many customers may be directly affected by the
vulnerability. SolarWinds is unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers.
Have N-able customers been affected?
No, N-able customer who do not use Serv-U are not affected by this vulnerability.
Updated July 13, 2021
What products are affected?
Only SolarWinds Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP for Windows are
affected by this vulnerability. Please note the Serv-U Gateway is a component of these two
products and is not a separate product.
The Linux versions of these products are not vulnerable to a RCE exploit of this security
vulnerability. The Linux version of the Serv-U product crashes when the exploit is attempted
by a threat actor.
Updated July 15, 2021
What products are not affected?
All other SolarWinds and N-able (formerly SolarWinds MSP) are not affected by this
vulnerability. This includes the Orion Platform, and all Orion Platform modules. A complete

How is SolarWinds addressing this?
SolarWinds released a hotfix Friday, July 9, 2021, and we recommend all customers using
Serv-U install this fix immediately for the protection of your environment.
Updated July 10, 2021
What actions should I take?

6/10

If you are an active maintenance SolarWinds customer of the Serv-U product,
SolarWinds asks you to log into your Customer Portal to access your updates. This update
is expected to take only a few minutes to implement.
If you are not on active maintenance and currently using a Serv-U product, our
Customer Success team is available to help you with your questions. Please open a
customer service ticket with the subject "Serv-U Assistance" and our team will assist you
(no login required).
Updated July 13, 2021
How can I tell if my environment has been compromised?
The following steps are steps you can take to determine if your environment has been
compromised:
1. Is SSH enabled for your Serv-U installation? If SSH is not enabled in the environment,
the vulnerability does not exist.
2. Is your environment throwing exceptions? This attack is a Return Oriented
Programming (ROP) attack. When exploited, the vulnerability causes the Serv-U product to
throw an exception and then intercepts the exception handling code to run commands.
Please note, several reasons exist for exceptions to be thrown, so an exception itself is not
necessarily an indicator of attack.
Please collect the DebugSocketlog.txt log file, which can be found in the following
locations:
C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\DebugSocketlog.txt
C:\ProgramFiles\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\DebugSocketlog.txt
In the log file DebugSocketlog.txt you may see an exception, such as:
07] Tue 01Jun21 02:42:58 - EXCEPTION: C0000005; CSUSSHSocket::ProcessReceive();
Type: 30; puchPayLoad = 0x041ec066; nPacketLength = 76; nBytesReceived = 80;
nBytesUncompressed = 156; uchPaddingLength = 5
Exceptions may be thrown for other reasons so please collect the logs to assist with
determining your situation.
3. Are you seeing potentially suspicious connections via SSH? Look for connections
via SSH from the following IP addresses, which have been reported as a potential indicator
of attack by the threat actor:
98[.]176[.]196[.]89
68[.]235[.]178[.]32
208[.]113[.]35[.]58

7/10

144[.]34[.]179[.]162
97[.]77[.]97[.]58
Other indicators:
hxxp://144[.]34[.]179[.]162/a
C:\Windows\Temp\Serv-u.bat
C:\Windows\Temp\test\current.dmp
4. Are you seeing potentially suspicious activity by Serv-U? Review your monitoring
tools and/or EDR platforms for Serv-U.exe spawning anomalous processes, such as:
mshta.exe
powershell.exe
cmd.exe (or conhost.exe then spawning cmd.exe) with any of the following in the
command line:
whoami
dir
./Client/Common
.\Client\Common
type [a file path] > "C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users\[file
name].Archive"
Any process with the following in the command line:
C:\Windows\Temp\
The addition of any unrecognized Global users to Serv-U. This can be checked in the
users tab of the Serv-U Management Console, as shown below. It can also be
checked by looking for recently created files in C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\ServU\Users\Global Users, which appears to store the Global users information.

If you observe this activity, investigate these processes further, and any traffic
originating from the Serv-U box. Please contact SolarWinds Customer Support with this
information, and we will escalate for investigation.
Is this vulnerability related to the SUNBURST cyberattack?

8/10

No. It’s important to note this new vulnerability is completely unrelated to the SUNBURST
supply chain attack. Software vulnerabilities are quite common, range in severity levels, and
are routinely resolved by software vendors as part of their ongoing maintenance release
schedules.
What kind of vulnerability is this?
Based on our investigations, this is a remote code execution (RCE) exploit.
What versions of Serv-U are affected?
Based on our investigations, this RCE exploit affects all versions of Serv-U, prior to version
15.2.3 HF2, which has been built to address this vulnerability, and to help protect your
environment.
Updated July 13, 2021
Where can I get additional information?
We understand the desire for more information on this issue, and we’ll provide more
information here as it’s available.
In the meantime, our Customer Success team is available to you. Please open a customer
service ticket with the subject "Serv-U Assistance" and our team will assist you (no login
required).
