A Closer Look at the Russian Actors Targeting
Organizations in Ukraine

March 3, 2022

In the context of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, we have reviewed the
cyberattacks against the Ukrainian organizations that occurred in January and February
2022. We have already provided a detailed analysis of the WhisperGate wiper here.
The Russian APT group Gamaredon (Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM) was attributed to the
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and was identified by Unit 42 researchers [1] and
Microsoft [2] targeting Ukrainian organizations in the last few months. Unit 42 collected three
significant clusters of infrastructure (malicious domains, IP addresses, and malware
samples).
The first cluster represents the Gamaredon downloader infrastructure. The threat actor
deployed the UltraVNC software to connect back to a remote system (reverse tunnel). The
second cluster contains C2 domains associated with Gamaredon’s file stealer tool. The last
cluster serves as the C2 infrastructure for a custom RAT called Pteranodon. We recommend
blocking the IoCs reported by Unit 42 [3] [4].

An example of a lure document used by Gamaredon in the past is displayed in figure 1.

After the WhisperGate attacks that occurred in January 2022, several cybersecurity
companies reported about a new wiper called HermeticWiper [5] [6] [7]. Before deploying the
wiper, multiple DDoS attacks took place against Ukrainian organizations that were attributed
to Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).
The wiper was signed with a certificate issued to a Cyprus-based company called Hermetica
Digital Ltd. Legitimate drivers from a tool called EaseUS Partition Master were utilized to
corrupt the MBR (Master Boot Record) and MFT (Master File Table) for every physical drive.
After a system reboot, the user is presented with the following screen:

CISA also issued an alert regarding the WhisperGate and HermeticWiper wipers [8]. We
recommend implementing the mitigation techniques presented in the alert to prevent similar
attacks.
UAC-0056 (Lorec53) is another threat group that recently attacked organizations in Ukraine
[9]. The infection vector is a spear-phishing email with a document attached containing three
embedded objects. The malicious document’s purpose is to write a JavaScript file that uses
PowerShell to download a payload known as SaintBot (downloader) and OutSteel (document
stealer). The malicious document used in this campaign is displayed below:

ESET researchers documented a new wiper called IsaacWiper, and a worm that spreads
HermeticWiper in the LAN called HermeticWizard [10]. HermeticWiper is spread across a
local network via WMI and SMB. IsaacWiper wipes the first 0x10000 bytes of each physical
disk using the ISAAC pseudorandom generator and all files on logical drives with random
bytes generated by the same generator. A timeline of the events is shown below:

Any Ukraine-based company for the next 6 months can get entirely free access
to SecurityScorecard’s enterprise license to protect themselves from malware resilience in
light of ongoing cyber-attacks. We are also providing them with free access to
SecurityScorecard forensics remediation team to deal with ransomware issues or to recover
from any outage. Simply email Ukraine@securityscorecard.io.
