Reviewing the spam filters: Malspam pushing Gozi-ISFB
Introduction
Researchers should review their spam filters to see what malware is getting
caught. Security professionals should be aware of current practices used by
criminals pushing malware, even if it has little chance of infecting anyone in
their organizations. Reviewing the spam filters keeps provides a clearer
picture of our cyber-threat landscape.

In today's trip through the spam filters, I found two emails with malicious
attachments. These attachments are Word documents with malicious macros
designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host with Gozi-ISFB.

1/10

Shown above: Never a good sign when the document asks you to enable
macros.
Unfortunately, I cannot share the emails. Both emails appear to contain
legitimate correspondence. They each include a chain of previous messages,
and I could not easily redact the information like I normally do with other
examples of malicious spam.
Therefore, this diary will focus on the attachments, follow-up malware, and
network traffic.
What is Gozi-ISFB?
Gozi-ISFB is a variant of Ursnif, and today's traffic looked like an example
shared by @DynamicAnalysis in a blog post on malwarebreakdown.com.
I generated two infections using each of the Word documents. In today's
activity, about 8 to 10 minutes after the initial infection, the infected Windows
host downloaded follow-up malware. Here's what I saw:
1st Word document --> Gozi-ISFB --> Nymaim Trojan
2nd Word document --> Gozi-ISFB --> unknown malware
The first infection followed-up with the Nymaim Trojan, and I've documented
Nymaim traffic back in November and December of 2017.

2/10

Shown above: Traffic from the 1st infection filtered in Wireshark.
Since I've covered Nymaim before, I'm far more insterested in the second
infection where I couldn't identify the follow-up malware.
The second infection
The second infection follows the same patterns as the first. However, this time
the follow-up malware is different. I saw encrypted traffic with no associated
DNS requests or domains. Two of the IP addresses had interesting certificate
data as shown in the images below.

3/10

Shown above: Traffic from the 2nd infection filtered in Wireshark.

Shown above: One example of certificate data from the encrypted postinfection traffic.

4/10

Shown above: Another example of certificate data from the encrypted postinfection traffic.
Based on the network traffic and post-infection artifacts, I could not identify the
follow-up malware. The follow-up malware is a malicious DLL named
winmm.dll that's loaded by a legitimate Windows system file named
presentationsettings.exe. Both were found in a newly-created directory
under the infected user's AppData\Roaming folder. See the indicators section
below for details.

Of note, during the first infection, I rebooted the infected Windows host 3 or 4
times, which might account for multiple copies of what I assume are Nymaim.
If you review the pcaps, the reboots are indicated any place you see an HTTP
request to www.msftncsi.com.
Malicious domains

8/10

Indicators are not a block list. If you feel the need to block web traffic based on
this diary, I suggest the following domains:
ijqdjqnwiduqujqiuezxc.com
adistributedmean.net
fyibc.com
fortrunernaskdneazxd.com
bithedistributedlicense.net
fyicreative.ca
Final words
Pcaps and malware for today's diary can be found here.
Good spam filtering, proper Windows administration, and best security
practices will ensure most people never see this malware. However, criminals
are constantly tweaking their methods in an attempt to slip past our defenses.
It pays to be aware of current malware indicators, so we're prepared if any ever
make it into our network.

Unfortunately this sometimes can be tricky to update filters to block
preemptively in some organizations do not want to miss out on mail especially
false positives. Many times security researchers are subjected to only
employing filters reactively and specific to the malspam. These filters generally
are very specific and only come after the fact of discovery which usually means
someone opened the email and attachment. In todays business landscape
businesses need to stand strong with their security policies and do due
diligence to ensure that if false positives are caught, they have a process in
place to allow audit of these emails and releasing of them. All to often the
reaction is to turn off the filters because the emails get held up and impacts
sales. Unfortunately this happens at the cost of security. Just my 2 cents.

So how did the malware get attached to legitimate emails?

Quoting SasK:So how did the malware get attached to legitimate emails?
That's a very good question. If they are in fact legitimate emails, this implies a
host used by the other email account (or perhaps the email account itself)
communicating the with recipient is compromised. It's possible an infected host
is using a local cache of an email client to send these messages.
Unfortunately, without having access to the host at the other end of the
conversation, I don't know how this is being done.

It's also possible these long email chains are completely fake, but what little
I've seen indicates they are not. For example, signature blocks used by the
recipient in previous correspondence from the email chain make me think
these are legitimate conversations, and the host at the other end is somehow
compromised. How this happened? I don't know.
