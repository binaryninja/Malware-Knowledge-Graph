Introduction
Intelligence powers

Dive into the top threat
actors, attack vectors,
and threat intelligence
trends of 2014.

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Intro:

two thousand fourteen

At CrowdStrike, “Intelligence powers everything we do.” This is not a corporate slogan,
and it is not a marketing theme. It is the realization of having the most dedicated
professionals focusing on solving problems that have real strategic, political, and
financial impact on our customers. When we consider the problems facing our
customers, we know that intelligence allows them to make key decisions that can mean
the difference between disaster and triumph.
In the earliest days building CrowdStrike, we drew heavily on the concepts
encompassed in Colonel John Boyd’s OODA loop (OODA is an acronym for Observe,
Orient, Decide, Act). It has been applied over the years to all manner of decision-making
situations. The core of the OODA model is that a decision-making process is broken into
phases, and in an adversarial encounter, two entities will go through the same process.
Whichever entity goes through the process the fastest will likely prevail.
The reason that intelligence powers everything we do is that we seek to provide our
customers with the ability to come to a decision (the last step of the OODA loop)
before the adversary does, thus ensuring a favorable outcome. In intelligence circles,
this is often referred to as decision advantage, and when dealing with adversaries trying
to compromise your enterprise security, you want it.
Throughout 2014, the activity monitored by CrowdStrike in the cyber domain was
reflective of the events unfolding in the real world. This was punctuated in late 2014
with the now-infamous attack attributed to North Korean actors who levied destructive
malware in a flagrant assault against a private entity. The actor in this case, which
CrowdStrike has traced back to 2006, has a history of using destructive code against its
targets. This actor again launched attacks in December against its usual adversary, the
Republic of Korea.
The highly publicized events that initially suppressed the release of a movie deemed
offensive by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea resulted in unprecedented
awareness of the power that one adversary can wield against a target if they are
suitably motivated.
This final chapter in 2014 closed out what was a year of attribution and adversary
focus. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice, in concert with various partners including
CrowdStrike researchers, disrupted the infrastructure of Gameover Zeus, a prolific

botnet that was the scourge of security practitioners across the globe. This disruption,
which also impacted the nefarious CryptoLocker malware, provided the pause in
adversary activity needed by law enforcement to levy charges and take legal action to
permanently impact this malware.
In that same month, the U.S. Department of Justice charged five officers in the
People’s Liberation Army, the military organ of the People’s Republic of China, with
violating 18 U.S. Code § 1030. In June, CrowdStrike published a detailed analysis of
an actor associated with the 12th Bureau of the Third General Staff Department. This
report demonstrated a direct lineage between malware targeting a variety of western
technology and government targets, and an individual in the Chinese intelligence service.
The events that unfolded in the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands, the
emergence of ISIS, the unrest in Ukraine, and the disappearance of a Malaysian airliner
all took on a cyber element. This is no coincidence. The nation-states of the world are
all seeking the aforementioned decision advantage, and they know that the use of
interconnected computers allows them to collect intelligence that gives them the ability
to make informed decisions.
Our customers rely on us to provide them intelligence to thwart these attacks and make
informed decisions. This report will provide an overview of some of the intelligence
analyzed by the CrowdStrike team over the past year.
Wrapping so much analysis into one report means a lot of tough decisions needed to
be made on what to include. This report is structured to provide Key Findings first.
Following the key findings are some graph data based on the patterns that emerged
though visibility attained by the CrowdStrike team; this is meant to provide a snapshot
of the dozens of adversaries tracked this year. In the Notable Activity section, we cover
the three motivations that we see: Criminal, Targeted-Intrusion, and Hacktivist/Activist.
We explore notable activity around zero-day exploits and event-specific operations
conducted by these adversaries.
There are so many interesting actors we discovered this year, and even more that
advanced from previous years; the Know the Adversary section contains interesting
observations for just a few of the adversaries from the intelligence reports we
publish through the subscription service. Finally, we provide an analysis of the
2013 report predictions for the past year, and a forecast of what to expect in 2015.

Key
Findings:

two thousand fourteen

• Financial crime malware disruptions in 2014 changed
the threat landscape by eliminating two prevalent
malware families.
• Since the high-profile Target breach in 2013, Pointof-Sale (PoS) malware became prevalent in the targeting
of numerous retail organizations. Look for policy and
process changes to mitigate this threat in 2015.
• China-based adversaries continued to be the most
prolific in the targeted intrusion space, but public
reporting on a number of actors linked to Iran and
Russia show the breadth of the threat from targeted
intrusion operators.
• High-profile events continued to drive a significant
number of targeted intrusion campaigns. In 2014,
unpredictable events such as the Malaysia Airlines
incidents and increased unrest in Ukraine drove
campaigns more than planned events such as the
World Cup or the G20 Summit.
• Malicious activity related to elections in Ukraine and
Hong Kong underscore the threat state-sponsored
adversaries (and possibly hacktivist or nationalist
actors) pose to democratic processes.
• CrowdStrike reported on a number of new,
sophisticated adversaries from China and Russia such
as HURRICANE PANDA, GOTHIC PANDA,
FANCY BEAR, and BERSERK BEAR.

During 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed significant activity from 39
state-sponsored and nationalist adversaries targeting numerous verticals
all over the globe. The charts below provide a high-level illustration of this
targeting. There are a few takeaways from this data.
Vietnam and GOBLIN PANDA were respectively the most targeted
country and the most active adversary. From late spring through summer,
GOBLIN PANDA conducted consistent targeted intrusion operations
targeting organizations in Vietnam focused on tensions in the South China
Sea. These campaigns relied primarily on spear phishing with malicious
documents that dropped malware (mostly PlugX) along with Vietnameselanguage decoy documents. The content of these decoys often came from
documents produced by Vietnam’s government, which indicates that the
adversary possibly infiltrated the government’s network and was using
stolen documents in its operations. The frequency of GOBLIN PANDA’s
operations, and targeted activity aimed at Vietnam in general, tailed off in
the final months of 2014, but the volume of activity in spring and summer
was enough to push them to the top of CrowdStrike’s targeting stats.

Significant Targeting by Country in 2014

PlugX was by far the most used malware variant for targeted activity
during 2014. It proliferated greatly amongst China-based targeted intrusion
adversaries and now appears to be the tool of choice for many. The
malware has been around for years and has been used by multiple Chinese
actors for quite some time; however, the frequency of PlugX use during
2014 revealed just how prominent it is.
PlugX is used by both more advanced China-based adversaries such as
AURORA PANDA and adversaries of a lower level of sophistication such
as GOBLIN PANDA. The reason for its prevalence is not clear. It is possible
that there is a central malware dissemination channel supplying many
Chinese adversaries and this is why so many groups are now using it. It is
also possible that groups not using it in the past were more recently able
to obtain it via the underground or public malware repositories.

The stats below also reflect a wide range of other malicious cyber activity
associated with numerous other events. The conflict in Ukraine resulted in
targeted intrusion and other activity from both Russia-based and Chinabased adversaries. Adversaries with a nexus to Iran were also very active in
2014 targeting western government entities as well as private organizations,
particularly in the defense sector. Elections were also heavily targeted in
2014 both in Ukraine and in Hong Kong, where the Umbrella Revolution
garnered a great deal of attention from Chinese actors. These and a number
of other topics are covered in more detail in the sections below.

Criminal

Cybercrime Trends in 2014
2014 was an extremely active year for cybercrime.
Financial Trojans grew in both complexity and penetration.
Two major banking botnets – Gameover Zeus (GOZ)
and Shylock – dominated the first half of the year. Their
development focused on the ability to deliver complex
web injection scripts used to overcome two-factor
authentication and online banking security.
Two large, successful disruptions were mounted mid-year with CrowdStrike
assisting in a June takeover of GOZ (see the next section), and in Shylock being
taken down in July. For some time, this left a void in this space, but adversaries
were very quick to adapt. With many services that catered to GOZ and Shylock
still in operation, it was inevitable other botnets would step up to the plate.
CrowdStrike is now observing two new major contenders in this space:
Dyreza and Dridex, also known as Bugat. Dyreza takes a more simplistic
approach to banking fraud, acting to intercept logins and perform malicious
actions by acquiring the HTTP POST data from under banking SSL sessions.
Dridex uses the classic banking Trojan tactic of relying on complex JavaScript
web injects targeted at the institutions it wishes to steal from. Both threats
rely on the same criminal ecosystem as their predecessors.
Upatre, a loader previously used for delivering GOZ, is now being used to
deliver Dyreza, and known loaders such as Andromeda, Smoke Loader,
and Pony Loader continue to be developed in order to deliver these
primary payloads. The Cutwail and Pushdo botnets, previously tasked with
distributing loaders for GOZ, have since been retasked, and, alongside other
spamming botnets, are now delivering a number of phishing lures that
ultimately lead to the infection with persistent payloads. Dridex, for
example, favors Word documents with obfuscated macros. These macros,
if allowed to execute, will reach out and download first-stage loaders that will
then install the Dridex payload onto the victim machine.

In addition to the changing banking Trojan landscape, ransomware has also
undergone a major shift throughout 2014 — in particular becoming much
more professionally organized. CryptoLocker’s success made it the first
ransomware variant to make it into prime-time news. Its success was, in part,
due to its wide distribution, acting as an alternative revenue stream for the
operators of GOZ. When GOZ was dismantled, CryptoLocker was also taken
down, but now in its place many other copycat ransomware families are
trying to replicate its success, such as CryptoWall and TorrentLocker.
So what is to be expected for the cybercrime landscape of 2015?
CrowdStrike predicts the continuation of development in banking Trojans
such as Dyreza and Dridex. As recently as November, Dridex has added
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality to its arsenal in an attempt to become
more resilient, and it is likely changes in its capability will continue. In
addition, it is likely new threats will follow the business model of using of
phishing lures delivered by spambots using a range of first-stage loaders to
keep their primary payloads under the radar. Ransomware will continue to
become more of a threat as continued copycats try to develop the
next market leader.

Gameover Zeus Takedown
Gameover Zeus (GOZ) was a complex P2P botnet that has been one of the
most prevalent cyber threats for almost four years. It was forked off the
infamous Zeus Trojan, the source code of which was leaked in spring 2011 –
just a few months before the appearance of the first GOZ version. GOZ was
largely used for banking fraud and the delivery of other malware, such as the
CryptoLocker ransomware Trojan, and is believed to have caused more than
$100 million in financial damage.
The GOZ botnet was long believed to be resistant to any takedown attempts
because of its complex, tiered infrastructure: Infected machines form a
decentralized P2P network, with some peers acting as proxy nodes (brokers
between bots and the next tier). This upper tier, again, consists of proxies
that conceal the location of the actual back end. The use of P2P technology
eliminates static rendezvous points and allows the botnet operators to
announce new centralized components at any time, which makes any

efforts against them pointless. On top of this, a fallback mechanism
generates a weekly-changing, deterministic set of 1,000 domain names
that the botmaster can register in order to serve fresh peer lists. Bots that
fail to establish contact with the P2P network would consult the Domain
Generation Algorithm (DGA) in order to retrieve a new set of peers. Finally,
all communication in the botnet is encrypted.
In June 2014, the botnet was disrupted in a coordinated effort called
Operation Tovar that was the culmination of months of technical
investigation and legal wrangling. The botnet was disrupted by the taking
over of its infrastructure and at the same time preventing access by the
botmasters. While this effort had to take into account and block all different
communication channels, it was primarily focused on the P2P network,
as it was the most complex component. By propagating specially crafted
messages in the botnet, its infrastructure was degenerated and bots were
redirected to sinkholes.
The CrowdStrike Intelligence team provided technical expertise to permit
the enforcement of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), which successfully
disrupted not only the infamous Gameover Zeus botnet, but also
CryptoLocker. In addition to the technical disruption, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed an indictment against an individual called Evgeniy Mikhailovich
Bogachev, who is believed to be behind the GOZ botnet, as well as several
other unnamed co-conspirators.

Point-of-Sale Malware and Related Intrusions
Credit card fraud has traditionally been popular in the cybercrime scene.
In cases where credit card data is stolen through website breaches, the
exposed data usually consists of the card numbers, expiration dates,
cardholder names, and card security codes. However, with this data
alone, it is not always possible to accurately recreate what can be found
on a card’s magnetic strip. In the criminal marketplace, card track data is
therefore generally more highly valued than the information mentioned
above because it can be used in multiple ways, including manufacturing
counterfeit credit cards.
Throughout 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence investigated several large

15

breaches of U.S. companies in the retail sector. These breaches involved
targeting of Point-of-Sale (PoS) terminals in order to plunder consumer
credit card information. By infecting terminals with malware specifically
designed to steal credit card information as the cards are swiped by
customers, attackers were able to collect data for hundreds of thousands of
credit cards. Running in the background of a terminal, the malware would
continuously scan memory for unique patterns found on a card’s magnetic
strip and exfiltrate matching data to an adversary-controlled server.

Most PoS malware families will attempt to validate data matching the search
pattern using the Luhn Algorithm. This algorithm, originally developed by
IBM in the 1950s, allows for validation of card numbers by performing an
arithmetic operation against them. Despite being developed in the premodern computing era, the algorithm is still widely used in many modern
systems including cell phone IMEI numbers, credit card numbers, and
national identification numbers.

Target Breach
On 19 December 2013, U.S.-based retailer Target released a statement
confirming a breach and providing an estimate of the total scope. According
to the statement, the actors were able to steal data for approximately 40
million credit cards and up to 70 million individuals’ records with Personally
Identifiable Information (PII). From reporting about the breach, it is publicly
speculated that the actors were able to access Target’s network via
credentials stolen from a Pennsylvania-based HVAC contractor that provided
services to Target.
In January 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence analyzed several files from the
incident. One of these files was a PoS malware named Kaptoxa (also known
as mmon), which is used as a component in another PoS malware, BlackPoS.
This copy of Kaptoxa continuously scanned volatile memory of infected
systems for patterns that looked like credit card numbers and logged them
to a file that was transferred to an internal network share at regular intervals.
Another utility was deployed onto these network shares to perform the final
exfiltration step in which the data was transferred to external FTP servers.
In January 2014, CrowdStrike identified a malware staging site that was
hosting a copy of the BlackPoS source code. While it is believed that this
site is not linked to the Target breach, analysis of the source code provided
additional insight into the simplicity of these tools. Compared to other
crimeware families, most PoS malware is relatively simple in design and
functionality. The malware used does not accept tasking from controllers or
external systems; its sole function is to scan, log, and exfiltrate data found.
Despite the simplistic nature of these tools, the adversary behind the Target
breach demonstrated sophisticated tradecraft in mounting a successful
operation, primarily by taking full advantage of the initial stolen credentials
to laterally move throughout the targeted network into the PoS systems.

The Rise of Commodity PoS
In 2014, while several major companies were coping with breaches of their
PoS infrastructure, many smaller retailers were facing the same threat from
less-organized groups. In underground marketplaces, ready-to-use PoS
malware kits were becoming more commonly available.

17

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Notable

Malware such as BlackPoS requires a bit of strategic planning on the part of
the adversary; much of the system lacks the point-and-click intuitive nature
of commodity botnets. For less-organized or less-skilled adversary groups,
an off-the-shelf kit such as Dexter PoS may allow for exploitation and
offensive capabilities that may not otherwise be possible.
Dexter, which CrowdStrike Intelligence reported on in 2013, became one of
the most publicly known PoS malware kits on the market. By late 2014, the
source code for Dexter was publicly available on several criminal forums. The
malware scans memory for both Track 1 and Track 2 credit card data and
exfiltrates its findings back to control servers over HTTP requests.

Dexter
Commandand-Control
Panel

Dexter offers an adversary a clean, simple control panel, which allows for
infected host management and viewing of obtained data.
In 2014, CrowdStrike investigated several other kits similar to Dexter,
including vSkimmer and JackPoS, which also focused on stealing credit
card numbers from infected terminals. Many of these lacked technical
sophistication, but were generally found to be effective in identifying and
exfiltrating any found data.

State

Targeted Intrusion Trends in 2014
Incidents of targeted intrusion activity related to nation-state interests have
been on the increase for the past several years. Different states’ activities
often reflect their national interests and agendas, or their deepest concerns.
As an example, Chinese nation-state actors appeared to clearly align and plan
operations in support of real-world activities in the case of the Haiyang Shiyou
981 oil platform. In direct contradiction to pre-planned operations, in the case
of the Umbrella Revolution that dominated the streets of Hong Kong during
the summer and fall of 2014, Chinese adversary groups were observed broadly
targeting any and all organizations related to the civil unrest in a wild attempt
to collect intelligence on the protestors and their movements.
During the course of 2014, CrowdStrike observed the continued proliferation
of targeted intrusion activity. Nation-states understand the value of
collecting intelligence in the information domain and are mobilizing
resources to capitalize on the intelligence opportunities that exist there.
While the CrowdStrike Intelligence team identified and analyzed well over a
dozen new adversary groups worldwide in 2014, there were several that were
of general interest.

FLYING KITTEN
FLYING KITTEN is an adversary believed to be operating
out of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This group was first
observed initiating targeted intrusion activity in late 2013
and has continued to be active throughout 2014. In January
2014, CrowdStrike became aware of an ongoing operation by this actor
targeting a company in the defense industrial base in the United States. This
campaign leveraged fake websites to trick users into entering credentials,
and to concurrently serve malware that poses as software updates for
legitimate applications. Shortly after this activity was identified, other
campaigns against additional targets in the defense and aerospace sectors
were observed. Evidence supporting the attribution of FLYING KITTEN to
Iran is found in their secondary focus, which targets Iranian dissidents in
foreign countries, as well as in Iran itself.

19

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Notable
Activity

A common tactic of FLYING KITTEN is to set up spoofed login web pages
on domains that closely resemble the legitimate pages used by the targets.
These fake web pages serve two purposes: They log credentials entered by
users who believe the page is a legitimate authentication mechanism, and
then redirect to another page that prompts the download of an alleged
patch or update that is, in fact, a copy of their remote access tool. This tool
is used to log keystrokes, screenshots, and other user activity on infected
systems and exfiltrates this data to an attacker-controlled server.
The primary remote access tool used by FLYING KITTEN is a dropper that
is written in C# .NET and generally uses the same filename. The files to be
dropped are stored in .NET resources embedded in the executable. When
executed, it extracts and deploys a backdoor Trojan, a configuration file,
and optionally a decoy (an image or a legitimate executable). Likewise, the
backdoor executable is also written in C#, meaning it can be decompiled
back to a representation of the original source code. This code lists several
classes with telling names, such as Stealer.Browser, Stealer.Keylogger, or
Stealer.Messenger. Further, the code contains transcripts of Farsi language
artifacts, e.g., HavijeBaba and salam!*%#, as shown below.

In addition to the aerospace/defense and dissident targeting, it appears
that FLYING KITTEN was also engaged in broader targeting via the website
parmanpower.com that purported to be the website of a business engaged
in recruiting, training, and development in Erbil, Iraq. The Whois record

20

for this website is the same as for some of the other domains related to
the activity discussed above, which indicates that it was also in use by this
adversary, but the actual purpose of the website is still unknown.
The registrant email that currently appears in Whois records for many of
the observed domains is info@usa.gov.us. However, historical records show
that the domains were originally registered under the email address keyvan.
ajaxtm@gmail.com, which ties back to an Iran-based entity called Ajax
Security Team. This group has been known for low-level web defacements
and SQL injection attacks for some time. Until early 2014, Ajax Security
had an easily identifiable presence on the Internet with its own website and
related Facebook pages. This Internet presence has decreased significantly,
likely due to a desire to keep a lower profile now that the group is engaged
in targeted intrusion activity.

CHARMING KITTEN
In late May, public reporting was released about an Iran-based adversary that
leverages fake personas on social networking sites in order to conduct social
engineering and ultimately targeted attacks against desired targets. This
adversary, CHARMING KITTEN, has been known to CrowdStrike Intelligence
since January 2014, when it was observed targeting individuals in the U.S.
government and defense sectors.
CHARMING KITTEN engaged in both credential collection and malware
operations. Credential collection occurred through spoofed websites meant
to appear as if they were legitimate sites such as YouTube.
When victims clicked on the log
in link, they were redirected to a
different website that prompted
them to enter credentials for
harvesting by the adversary.
The malware used by this
adversary is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC)-based malware variant referred to
as Parastoo because of the IRC password it uses. This malware possesses

21

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Notable
Activity

an extensive command set capable of conducting reconnaissance of victim
machines, deleting files, downloading files, and exfiltrating data.
A number of factors support CHARMING KITTEN’s nexus to Iran. First of
all, the “Parastoo” password used by the malware is an Iranian word used
to refer to small birds. Also, the adversary used Iran-based web hosting
providers and infrastructure to host malicious domains. Finally, one of
the droppers related to one of the identified Parastoo variants dropped a
Persian-language decoy document purporting to be from Iran’s Ministry of
Interior.

PlugX – The Panda’s Tool of Choice
CrowdStrike has observed an upward trend in the use of PlugX Remote
Access Tool (RAT) malware during 2014. Multiple adversary groups have
used PlugX to target a number of sectors in countries surrounding China’s
sphere of influence, particularly those involved in science & technology,
government, and defense. Further afield, PlugX has been used in persistent
campaigns against commercial entities in the United States, as well as to
target organizations involved in counter-terrorism or other political
efforts worldwide.
Attacks associated with GOBLIN PANDA have been observed at an
increasing rate throughout the latter half of the year, while in the closing
months of 2014 CrowdStrike has investigated several instances of PlugX
activity consistent with the HURRICANE PANDA and PALE PANDA
adversaries. Other China-based adversaries observed using PlugX in their
operations include AURORA PANDA, NIGHTSHADE PANDA, PREDATOR
PANDA, EMISSARY PANDA, and WET PANDA. The upward trend in use of
PlugX indicates an increasing confidence in the capabilities of the platform,
justifying its continued use across multiple sectors and countries.
PlugX has existed in some form since 2008 and has evolved over time to
offer new capabilities and control mechanisms, supported by an active
development program. It provides an attacker with a range of functionality
including the ability to log keystrokes; modify and copy files; capture
screenshots or video of user activity; and perform administrative tasks such

22

Activity

as terminating processes, logging off users, and rebooting victim machines.
A full command shell is also provided through access to a cmd.exe process,
which sends output to the PlugX instance over named pipes for onward relay
to the attacker’s Command-and-Control (C2) servers.
While these capabilities are not unusual for a RAT and are comparable to
those provided by Poison Ivy and other tools, PlugX also offers a range of C2
protocols and execution options that help reduce the risk of being detected
by network defenders. Over time, these capabilities have been augmented
with additional releases of versions and plugins, which have in turn been
deployed by adversaries in active and ongoing campaigns. For example,
GOBLIN PANDA has been observed using PlugX with internal version
numbers of 20140101 in campaigns since Q2 2014, migrating to deployments
of 20140606 versions in the second half of the year.
PlugX is most frequently delivered to targets via a spear phishing attack
containing a malicious RTF or Word document leveraging exploit code
for the popular CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability. Some adversary groups also
attempted to leverage the CVE-2014-1761 vulnerability as a way to maximize
the chance of exploitation against more recently patched systems, with
varying degrees of success.
Attacks have also been identified using PowerPoint and Excel file formats, as
well as self-extracting RAR files and plain executables as email attachments.
However PlugX is installed on a victim machine, typically three files are
dropped on the file system after exploitation to enable initial start-up of
the malware: a legitimate, digitally signed application; an encrypted file
containing the PlugX payload; and a malicious, dynamically-linked library
that is used to load the malware using the Dynamic Link Library (DLL)
side-loading technique when the legitimate application is executed. This
methodology can provide a level of protection against some threat detection
techniques employed by anti-virus software packages, as the parent process
is a non-malicious executable. Often, a computer security tool such as a
component of a commercial anti-virus application is used for this purpose,
likely to take advantage of any process whitelisting strategies that may be in
place on a network.

Command and control of PlugX malware is facilitated using a range of
protocols including HTTP and a binary channel over ICMP. During 2014,
CrowdStrike observed an increased use of a newer DNS C2 module that
transmits data as lengthy DNS queries to adversary-controlled infrastructure.
While this mechanism deviates from some of the more typically monitored
protocols, the verbosity of communication using this module may provide
opportunities for detection through proactive analysis of such traffic leaving
a network.

Further demonstrating the continued development of this platform,
CrowdStrike observed modifications to HTTP and DNS requests produced by
PlugX throughout the year, presenting an adapting challenge for detection
of this threat. However, while some adversary groups have registered
domains over the course of 2014 for use in PlugX C2 (e.g., proxyme.net),
there has been a continued use of domain names that have been active for
a number of years, indicating the effectiveness of this infrastructure over
extended periods of time.
The ongoing development of PlugX provides attackers with a flexible
capability that requires continued vigilance on the part of network defenders
in order to detect it reliably. There is currently no clear evidence to suggest
that use of PlugX has proliferated to adversaries attributed outside of China;
an increase in its deployment over the last year could be a precursor to
future worldwide use, particularly as PlugX succeeds legacy capabilities such
as Poison Ivy as an adversary tool of choice.

Hacktivist/Nationalist
Hacktivist- and nationalist-motivated cyber actors are a third class of
adversary tracked by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team. The goals of these
actors may range from causing mischief for laughs to influencing opinions
or views about a particular issue. During the course of 2014, there were a
few notable events that demonstrate the capabilities of these actors. As
electronic voting continues to be used by more and more countries, the
targeting of such processes and equipment will continue to expand.

Operations Targeting Elections
In July 2014, the electronic voter registration system for the thenupcoming Tunisian presidential election suffered a cyber attack, rendering
registrations impossible for an unknown amount of time. Sources reported
that the authorities had control over the attack and that it was a systematic
process, intended to strike the electoral process. This incident is yet another
example of cyber attacks targeting electronic voting systems to
manipulate an outcome.

CyberBerkut
In February 2014, several bloody protests took place in Ukraine resulting
in the ousting of the pro-Russia prime minister, and an interim government
was created with the goal of creating closer ties with the European Union
(EU). Following the protests, CyberBerkut, a self-proclaimed nationalistic
hacking group, began taking credit for hacks against Ukrainian interim
leaders. The group was extremely proactive about distributing propaganda
decrying the new government and recruiting pro-Russia supporters to
engage in participatory Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against
a multitude of Ukrainian government and media sites. These attacks were
likely directed by Russian state services, with the CyberBerkut hacktivists
providing a layer of plausible deniability.
Several of the DDoS attacks against Ukraine’s Central Election Commission
(CEC) coincided with Russian state media broadcasts, further suggesting
coordination at the state level. In one case, an attack on the CEC occurred
around the time the election results were supposed to appear, while a
simultaneous broadcast on Russian state media appeared to show false

results where an extremist candidate won the election by a hefty margin.
The goal of the operation was likely to cause temporary confusion over
the immediate results of the election and to cause observers to question
the legitimacy of the elections, which were touted as being fair and well
equipped to withstand attacks. Had the operation been successful, it likely
would have incited unrest in Ukraine and supported the Russian narrative
that the elections were illegitimate and that Russian intervention was needed
to prevent Ukraine from slipping into complete chaos.
Whereas previous conflicts between Russia and former Soviet states
Estonia and Georgia saw a much heavier use of cyber tactics used to bring
down critical infrastructure and disrupt communications, the efforts against
Ukraine appeared muted and designed more for a disinformation campaign
to stir unrest in order for Russia to intervene in Ukraine in a “peacekeeper”
role as it did in Crimea. The widespread publicity the conflict received in
global media along with the threat of heavy sanctions imposed by the west
may have been a factor in preventing more aggressive cyber
action from Russia.
Although the campaign appeared to be ultimately unsuccessful, partly due
to a prepared Ukrainian defense, CrowdStrike noted several interesting
observations. Though the use of a proxy to carry out attacks for the
purposes of plausible deniability is hardly new, the coordination of the
propaganda distributed and Russian media reporting was particularly
telling with regard to how Russian state services can direct many moving
parts in unison to achieve their goals via cyber means. In addition, the
participatory DDoS client software CyberBerkut advertised to help launch
DDoS attacks against the Ukrainian government actually installed a
backdoor on victims’ machines, presumably enabling Russian intelligence
services to make a new botnet out of the compromised “volunteers”, which
could be used in future conflicts.
CrowdStrike Intelligence also investigated targeted attacks by CyberBerkut
against Ukrainian organizations and entities operating or doing business
in Ukraine. CyberBerkut was first observed in March 2014 when it made
statements about the illegitimacy of the government that took over Ukraine

upon the ousting of former president,
Viktor Yanukovych. Around this same
time, the group launched DDoS attacks
against state-controlled media in the
country as well as against NATO entities
such as the Cooperative Cyber Defense
Center of Excellence (CCDCOE). In April,
CyberBerkut claimed responsibility for
defacing the websites of several private
military companies – Greystone, Triple
Canopy, and Academi – that they claimed
were operating on the ground in Ukraine.
CyberBerkut’s operations during 2014 were very much in line with the
priorities of the Russian state; however, it is unclear if its activity is directly
state sponsored or if it is an independent group carrying out attacks
motivated by Russian nationalistic ideals.

Umbrella Revolution
First observed in late 2013, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) steadily
increased the use of its intelligence services and cyber operations in Hong
Kong as part of a response to the protests supporting universal suffrage and
democracy headed by Occupy Central (和平占中). The Hong Kong protests
fueled fears in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which perceives them
as a threat to its one-party rule in mainland China. This perceived threat
likely prompted the flurry of malicious cyber activity taken against various
organizations and citizens operating in support of the protests within Hong
Kong, later dubbed the Umbrella Revolution.
The methods used were a smattering of cyber tactics and human intelligence
(HUMINT) methods to collect information about leaders of the Occupy
Central Movement and locations of its supporters, as well as to gain an
overall picture of Hong Kong citizens’ perception of the protests. This began
with strategic web compromises of key websites associated with Occupy
Central in late 2013, followed by extensive HUMINT activities carried out
in early 2014 by suspected Ministry of State Security (MSS) officers likely

designed to elicit information from influential figures in Hong Kong and
pressure them to support Beijing’s stance in exchange for gifts.
The protests reached a critical point when a democratic online referendum
was held in June 2014 calling for open elections of Hong Kong’s chief
executive. At the peak of voting, the online hosting system, Popvote
(which at one point exceeded 500 gbps of traffic), suffered a massive
DDoS attack. The attackers were persistent and scaled their attacks as
defenders responded to the attack, starting with Layer 3 and 4 attacks and
progressively using more advanced Layer 7 attacks. Though the voting
system did persist and drew more than 780,000 votes, the apparent effort
the PRC went through to down the referendum was substantial.
As the protests persisted, the PRC appeared to increase its attempts to
monitor the protestors by proliferating mobile malware for both the Android
and iOS operating systems. The mobile Remote Access Tools (mRATs) were
authored by two individuals with extensive ties to legacy Chinese hackers
and were likely contracted out to customize malware for the purpose of
monitoring protestors’ communications and physical locations.
In addition to these specialized attacks and extensive censorship of the
Umbrella Revolution in mainland China, the PRC appears to have taken
a shotgun approach to handling the protests as they persisted. Several
known China-based groups including MAVERICK PANDA, VIXEN PANDA,
TEMPER PANDA, SABRE PANDA, and HURRICANE PANDA were observed
participating in activity related to the protests, suggesting a possible crossdivisional tasking as the CCP saw support for the protests increase. This
demonstrates the variety of approaches China has when dealing with a
threat to the CCP’s one-party rule. Along with the mobile targeting of most
of the citizens of Hong Kong, it shows a new level of brazenness that is
becoming increasingly common in Chinese cyber operations.

LizardSquad/DerpTrolling
DerpTrolling

The hacking collective DerpTrolling made early 2014 media headlines

28

after claiming a string of DDoS attacks on multiple gaming companies
and online gaming servers. The group likely originated out of the Steam
gaming community, where some of its suspected members engaged in early
DDoS attacks on rival gaming clans and their servers. DerpTrolling’s antics
were often childish and had no clear motive other than being “for the lulz”
and to boost their own egos. For this reason, they cannot be classified as
hacktivists. Despite their immaturity, the collective was able to consistently
carry out DDoS attacks on targets of their choosing, and these attacks had a
real-world effect on the victims within the gaming community.
The attacks were particularly noteworthy as their DDoS tool, dubbed the
Gaben Laser Beam (GLB) after Gabe Newell, the creator of Half-Life and
the Steam community, supposedly created an attack that exceeded 400
gbps of network traffic utilizing a NTP reflection attack. This suggested
DerpTrolling possessed an above-average knowledge of network protocols.
While NTP reflection is commonly known in the security community, most
“script kiddies” or “skids” were not aware of some of these more advanced
techniques involving amplification, which allows for fewer devices needed to
pull off larger DDoS attacks.
DerpTrolling has reportedly had several run-ins with law enforcement,
though it is unclear how much of this is verifiable versus a ploy to increase
their notoriety. One supposed encounter resulted in the group going silent
for several months before returning and carrying out lower-level attacks on
the gaming community once again. Given the collective’s poor operational
security practices, it is likely that the members are actively being tracked by
law enforcement agencies and that they cannot continue to maintain highprofile attacks while evading capture.

LizardSquad
Another group to begin DDoS operations targeting the gaming community
in 2014 is LizardSquad. The group was characterized by DerpTrolling
as much less skilled, however there may be some overlap of members
between the groups. At this time, LizardSquad has not shown any of the
more advanced amplification techniques used previously by DerpTrolling.
LizardSquad quickly rose to prominence after several media stunts drew

significant attention from the press as well as law enforcement. LizardSquad
not only began claiming to be affiliates of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(ISIS), but also called in a bomb threat, grounding a flight on which a Sony
Online Entertainment executive was a passenger. Though the group appears
to have no terrorist ties, their antics quickly gained them notoriety.
LizardSquad has even poorer operational security practices than
DerpTrolling, which allowed CrowdStrike to easily provide attribution on
possible members of the group. In addition, the group also admitted to
renting botnets and running booters, confirming that their skill level is
relatively low. Despite this, the threat they posed to gaming companies was
still noteworthy, especially when combined with terrorist threats; although
they were bluster, they still had considerable real-world consequences.

DEADEYE JACKAL: Far From Dead
Although DEADEYE JACKAL doesn’t have the kind
of coverage it once had in the media around its highprofile hacks, the group is still active. It still conducts the
occasional mass defacements and is focusing on improving
and strengthening its dissemination pathways, including migrating to more
private social media and adding a mobile site and Android app. DEADEYE
JACKAL even developed and released its own Linux-based operating
system, called SEANux, at the end of October 2014.

DEADEYE JACKAL continues its international censorship of online articles
that it deems detrimental to Syria or to Syrian President Bashar Assad. On
Thanksgiving, the group defaced just over 60 websites, including media
websites.1 The websites were primarily from the United States and the United
Kingdom but also included Japan, Canada, the Philippines, New Zealand,
Mexico, and South Africa. A message on DEADEYE JACKAL’s Twitter
account showed possible motivations outside of opportunistic targeting,
saying “The press: Please don’t pretend #ISIS are civilians”.
The most recent cyber attack by DEADEYE JACKAL was on 18 December
2014, when the group hacked the website of the International Business
Times to remove an article due to its coverage of Syria, which DEADEYE

JACKAL perceived as false.2 The deleted article discussed depleting military
resources of President Assad, in terms of soldiers, since the start of the U.S.
campaign in Syria against the Islamic State. The article, however, was soon
reposted by the International Business Times and remains available.3
DEADEYE JACKAL used to be limited to operating through its website,
Twitter account, and Facebook account, which proved problematic in some
ways since their communications could be terminated more easily when
Twitter or Facebook decided to shut down their accounts. It became a joke
to DEADEYE JACKAL how many Facebook pages it could start up that
would be shut down. However, DEADEYE JACKAL did realize that more
stable and varied dissemination pathways for their messaging were needed.
Additionally, the group decided it also needed communications that would
have less chance of being monitored by its enemies.
In September 2013, DEADEYE JACKAL changed its email provider from
Gmail to Mail.ru. The change was likely a result of suspicions that their emails
were being monitored in light of the leaks made by Edward Snowden earlier
in 2013. In other moves to protect privacy, DEADEYE JACKAL opened up
accounts with VK, formerly VKontakte4 (the Russia-based social media
website similar to Facebook owned by Mail.ru Group and Ello5), a new
social media website that boasts that it does not sell ads or its users’ data
to advertisers. It also does not allow any data mining against the users of
its site. DEADEYE JACKAL also launched a mobile site for its website and
an Android app. These are all in addition to the group’s already-established
accounts on Pinterest6, Instagram7, YouTube8, and Twitter9.
Most notably, the group developed and released its own operating system,
called SEANux. SEANux offers little overall improvement over other Linuxbased systems like Kali or BackTrack. SEANux automatically loads a desktop
system monitor that makes several network requests, creating a sidebar. The

The most notable aspect of SEANux is the tools it offers. SEANux offers
some standard offensive/pentesting tools, including Metasploit Framework,
SQLMap, nMap, Aircrack, and John the Ripper. There is also an included
directory with other miscellaneous PHP and Perl scripts, however most of
these do not appear to be created by DEADEYE JACKAL.

SEANux also offers a custom set of offensive/pentesting tools including:
• SEA SHELL - A basic web shell.
• UPLOADER - A web application for uploading files to the system where the
web app is hosted.
• MYSQL EXECUTOR - A web application for executing commands on local
and remote MySQL servers.
• JOOMLA & WORDPRESS SCANNER - A web application for checking
whether a remote system is running WordPress or Joomla.
• EXECUTER - A very rudimentary webshell for executing system
commands where the web app is hosted.
• DDOS ATTACKER - A basic DDoS web application. The adversary
specifies an IP address they want to flood with TCP or UDP traffic.
• WORDPRESS BRUTE FORCE ATTACKER - A web application for
preforming simple brute force attack against a WordPress site.
• JOOMLA BRUTE FORCE ATTACKER - A web application for
preforming simple brute force against Joomla sites.
• WEB SCANNER - A web application for scanning a remote web server for
files and folders.
• ORACLE QUERY EXECUTOR - A web application for executing commands
on local and remote Oracle database servers.
• ACP FINDER - A web application to scan for what are believed to be admin
control panels.
• BACK CONNECTION - A web application for creating a reverse shell
connection allowing another computer to control where the app is hosted.
• 5.2.3 SAFEMODE BYPASS / 5.2.11-5.3.0 SAFE MODE BYPASS - Both are
tools for attempting to bypass some of PHP’s built-in security.
DEADEYE JACKAL has not attempted the ruse that Anonymous did in
2012 when they released Anonymous-OS, which was found to be riddled
with Trojans. SEANux does connect to some DEADEYE JACKAL-controlled

operating system functions normally.

FRATERNAL JACKAL
In 2012 and 2013, a four-phased attack known as Operation Ababil, or
OpAbabil, was conducted by a group of Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial
institutions with DDoS attacks.
This adversary, which CrowdStrike tracks under the name FRATERNAL
JACKAL, has been suspected of having ties to the Iranian government. It
has been known to increase attack volume during periods of economic
tension between Iran and western countries. Despite suspicion of political
motivations, the group has publicly attested in several Pastebin.com posts
that the motivation for these attacks are negative depictions of the Muslim
Prophet Muhammad in several YouTube videos.
Attacks from this adversary group have been primarily conducted using
a botnet of public-facing web servers that have been exploited through
vulnerable Content Management Systems (CMS). Unlike traditional botnets
in which infected hosts connect to control servers for tasking, within
FRATERNAL JACKAL’s botnet, nodes are directly tasked by the adversary
through multiple layers of infrastructure.
CrowdStrike Intelligence continued to actively investigate this adversary
during 2014, specifically seeking means by which it propagated its botnet.
In October, a PHP script was identified in connection with this adversary.
This script is used for scanning lists of domains by parsing each domain’s
robots.txt file to identify any server running the CMS Joomla. Domains
identified from this script are directly posted to a hard-coded control server,
something not seen previously by CrowdStrike with this adversary’s toolkit.
Normally, performing server reconnaissance by parsing the robots.txt file
of a server is a trivial task. However, when looked at in the context of this
adversary’s strategic operations, it suggests that the adversary is not only

33

using their first-stage infrastructure for offensive actions against targets, but
also for further expansion of their botnet.
Despite FRATERNAL JACKAL no longer publicly posting motivations and
notices of upcoming attacks to Pastebin, their botnet remains online and
capable of performing attacks. It is likely that in the event of future tensions
between Iran and western countries, this group may publicly resurface and
continue their attack campaigns.

2014 Zero-Day Activity
The occurrence of a zero-day, or a previously unknown vulnerability being
exploited in the wild, is generally an unusual occurrence. These events almost
always tell an interesting story when they are initially discovered. During the
course of 2014, there were hundreds of newly identified vulnerabilities that
were categorized by Mitre under the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) system. Many of these were identified by researchers or vendors
through auditing and other proactive security reviews.
In some cases, the vulnerabilities were first identified being used by
adversaries (the development and proliferation of those vulnerabilities are
a fascinating component of the threat landscape). There were several such
events that occurred this year; three are particularly interesting from an
adversary perspective, namely CVE-2014-0322, CVE-2014-4113, and CVE2014-1761. There were numerous interesting exploits identified this year,
many used by various adversaries such as the SSL Heartbleed attack (CVE2014-0160) and the ShellShock Bourne Again Shell (BASH) vulnerabilities
(CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278, CVE-2014-7169, CVE2014-7186, and CVE-2014-7187). These exploits were not necessarily
exemplary of the related adversary narrative that helps to determine the
“who” behind the attacks that CrowdStrike focuses on from an intelligence
standpoint.

Web Compromise (SWC) or drive-by operations. There were two primary
campaigns associated with CVE-2014-0322.
The first to be publicly identified occurred in February 2014 and was hosted
on the website of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). This incident
delivered a fairly common, publicly available RAT called ZxShell, which
connected to a C2 at newss.effers.com. This is a domain that CrowdStrike
associates with the AURORA PANDA adversary.
Investigation into the VFW incident led to the discovery of other sites
(savmpet.com, gifas.assso.net, and icbcqsz.com) also hosting this exploit
code. These sites not only shared the same IP address as each other, but also
contained the same content that was taken from the website for the French
aerospace industries association, Groupement des Industries Françaises
Aéronautiques et Spatiales (GIFAS). The dates visible on these webpages
and those dates found in the pages’ source code indicated that they were
created on 17 January 2014, which predated the VFW incident by nearly a
month. However, this operation utilized drive-by tactics rather than SWC
because the sites hosting the code were controlled by the adversary and not
compromised legitimate sites.
The GIFAS-related activity delivered a different malware payload (Sakula)
than the VFW incident (ZxShell). The Sakula payload communicated with
an entirely different C2 infrastructure than the ZxShell, oa.ameteksen.com.
This indicates that a different adversary was responsible for the GIFASrelated SWC operation. Further investigation into this activity showed a
number of similarities to a 2012 zero-day (CVE-2012-4792) SWC campaign
that leveraged the website of a U.S.-based manufacturer, Capstone Turbine.
These similarities were: the use of Sakula malware, GIFAS-based subdomains
related to both incidents, and the use of zero-day vulnerabilities. At the end
of 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence also discovered potential links between this
adversary and its HURRICANE PANDA adversary (discussed in more detail
below); however, evaluation of these connections is still ongoing.

CVE-2014-4113 – Local Privilege Escalation

become desperate for access to a victim’s infrastructure. This occurred
in October 2014 when the Chinese adversary tracked by CrowdStrike as
HURRICANE PANDA deployed a tool called Win64.exe on a compromised
system that was used to invoke other programs with elevated privileges.
Analysis of the Win64.exe binary revealed that it exploits a previously
unknown vulnerability to elevate its privileges to those of the SYSTEM user
and then create a new process with these access rights to run the command
that was passed as an argument. The file itself is only 55 kilobytes in size and
contains just a few functions.
First, the exploit gained kernel execution by corrupting memory in the
Windows window manager and used this increased level of authority to
overwrite an access token in the EPROCESS structure of the user-mode
process with that of the SYSTEM process. From this elevation, any command
passed to the executable was executed with elevated privileges. The
vulnerability was present in both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures of Windows
from Windows XP to Windows 7.
The code to perform these steps is extremely well written and fully reliable.
The adversary has gone through considerable effort to minimize the
chance of its discovery. The exploit tool was only deployed when absolutely
necessary during the intrusion operations, and it was deleted immediately
after use.
A build timestamp of the Win64.exe binary of 3 May 2014 suggests that
the vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild for at least five months
prior to discovery. What is more, after being able to characterize the
exploit, earlier versions were found that indicate constant development of
privilege-escalation tools. In fact, some tools were found with exploits for
similar vulnerabilities that have been addressed by Microsoft in patches
released earlier in 2014. These tools share an overall structure with the
new one, indicating that the same code was used to weaponize privilegeescalation exploits for different security bugs. These observations suggest
that HURRICANE PANDA maintains an arsenal of exploits for unpatched
privilege-escalation vulnerabilities.

This case underlines the necessity of tight endpoint monitoring in order to
detect adversary behavior like this. Within days of discovering the use of
the exploit, CrowdStrike reported the vulnerability and a proof of concept to
Microsoft, which subsequently released security bulletin MS14-058, as well as
patches for all affected platforms.

CVE-2014-1761 - Microsoft Word
Remote Code Execution
In 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence spent a significant amount of time
investigating operations that leveraged the new Microsoft Word exploit,
CVE-2014-1761. The exploit for this vulnerability was a bit complex, but if
successful it allowed for remote code execution. Cybercrime adversaries
were the first to use the exploit in the wild; however, its use soon proliferated
to Russia- and China-based targeted intrusion adversaries.

The proliferation of an exploit such as CVE-2014-1761 across several
adversaries is not unprecedented, but it does illustrate the possible ways
in which actors are connected. In this instance, cybercrime actors were the
first observed using the exploit in the wild. Several weeks later targeted
intrusion adversaries began leveraging it in their operations. The most likely
explanation for this is that targeted intrusion adversaries were able
to rediscover and develop the exploit code once a vendor advisory
was released.

37

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

This seems to be the most likely because Microsoft released its initial
advisory on the exploit in late March, and targeted activity began in early
April. However, another possible proliferation pathway for the exploit is a
direct pass from a cybercrime actor to a targeted intrusion actor. It is also
possible that individuals involved in cybercrime operations are also carrying
out targeted intrusion operations and were able to use the exploit for
both purposes.
CrowdStrike Intelligence also discovered a simple builder program,
which allowed malicious actors to automatically build CVE-2014-1761
exploit documents.

This allows for a decoy document and malicious executable to be combined
with a malicious CVE-2014-1761 document. The Chinese characters show that
it was meant for use by Chinese adversaries, and could explain how it
so easily proliferated among China-based adversaries.
PITTY PANDA is one actor who actively developed the capability to use this
exploit. This actor is interesting in that they exhibit a remarkably disparate
level of sophistication. On the one hand, the actor has proven to be one
of the early groups that are able to successfully weaponize documents
with an exploit for CVE-2014-1761, showing a notable level of competence
in this specific matter. On the other hand, this adversary exhibits lack of

consistence or expertise in certain other areas. For example, the re-use of C2
domains ending in .tw certainly sticks out in target environments unrelated
to Taiwan. This was observed in attacks against western aerospace and
defense companies during 2014.
Recent CrowdStrike analysis on PITTY PANDA has revealed that this actor
has been operating for a longer time frame than previously assumed.
The activity likely goes back as far as June 2005, resulting in a total
operational window of more than nine years. PITTY PANDA has used at least
three different RAT families, some of which have undergone continuous
development.
PITTY PANDA has recently shifted their target profile toward the aerospace
and defense sectors, introducing a new aspect this actor’s operations.
The overall goal of much of PITTY PANDA’s past activity appeared to be
intelligence-gathering operations of a political nature, but more recent
operation point more toward the theft of intellectual property. The
development and adaptation of client-side exploits such as CVE-2014-1761
may indicate that this actor is seeking to further expand operations by
investing in technical capabilities to pursue harder targets than they have
previously attacked.

Event-Driven Operations
Malaysia Airlines Incidents

Malaysia Airlines suffered two catastrophic incidents in 2014. In March, one of
its flights (MH370) from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing mysteriously disappeared
less than an hour after takeoff. In July, another of its flights (MH17) from
Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down while flying over a conflict zone
in Ukraine. These events received large amounts of attention in the press,
and the controversy and mystery surrounding them made the incidents ideal
for targeted intrusion adversaries to use in their operations.
Operations leveraging the MH370 incident in spear phish email began within
days of the accident. The TEMPER PANDA adversary was particularly prolific
in its use of MH370-related emails to deliver malicious documents that

dropped malware connecting to a known TEMPER PANDA C2 address, www.
verizon.proxydns.com. Activity from the LOTUS PANDA adversary and an
actor using Naikon malware was also observed.
Additionally, CrowdStrike identified an incident carried out by an adversary
believed to have a nexus to Pakistan. This attack used a malicious zip archive
containing a file named Malaysia Airline MH370 hijacked by Pakistan.scr. It
delivered malware more commonly known as BitterBug, which used a C2 at
IP address 199.91.173.45.
Operations related to the MH17 crash appeared to be more limited, but also
began within days of the incident. A number of incidents from China-based
adversaries were observed like the one identified on 22 July 2014 leveraging
a decoy document concerning the black boxes on MH17 and NetTraveler
malware connecting to a C2 at www.gobackto.net. The Russia-based
adversary known to CrowdStrike as FANCY BEAR also piggybacked on the
MH17 disaster, targeting victims with the Sofacy malware dropped alongside
a document concerning the cessation of hostilities around the crash site.

Conflict in Ukraine
The conflict in Ukraine has been the motivation for a significant amount of
targeted intrusion operations and other malicious cyber activity. The conflict
was leveraged to conduct operations targeting entities in Ukraine, Russia,
and other countries with interests in the region.
China-based adversaries were active in targeting around this conflict. A
significant amount of the activity from Chinese actors was related to the
MH17 disaster discussed above. While other malicious operations related to
these events targeted Ukrainian entities, most of the activity from Chinabased actors appeared to be targeted at Russian organizations. Numerous
incidents were identified leveraging Russian-language lures with content
concerning security in Ukraine, such as the one below that was observed in
an incident from September using PlugX malware calling to chromeupdate.
authorizeddns.org and googlesupport.proxydns.com.

One of the primary reasons for this increase in Russian targeting by Chinabased adversaries is likely that ties between China and Russia have recently
been growing stronger. In May 2014, the two countries agreed on a $400
billion deal for Russia to supply natural gas to China. Additionally, they
reached agreements over the construction of a bridge between the countries
and the use of a port in eastern Russia; they also revealed a plan to set up
GPS ground stations in each other’s country. This interaction between the
two countries increasingly makes Russia a target of interest for Chinese
targeted intrusion operations.
In addition to the China-based activity, CrowdStrike Intelligence also
identified an interesting set of targeted activity apparently focused on
targets within Russia. The actor responsible employs a rather complex piece
of malware that uses polymorphic DLLs and filenames customized on a
per-deployment basis. The malware was dropped alongside a wide variety
of malicious documents containing exploit code for either CVE-2012-0158
or CVE-2014-1761. Related decoy documents were both Russian and English
language and contained content pertaining to Russia such as the Ukrainian
conflict, an advertisement for the sale of a car from the German embassy
in Moscow, and an invitation to a Russian university conference on space
technology. The actor abuses legitimate cloud infrastructure for its C2.

High Volume of Southeast Asia Targeting
Governments in Southeast Asia and organizations doing business in the
region have been popular targets for China-based targeted intrusion
operations for years. China is generally interested in Southeast Asia because
of its proximity and its desire to monitor activity in the region in order
to retain a strategic advantage. However, during 2014, China was more
specifically motivated to carry out targeted intrusion operations in the
region by tensions between it and other Southeast Asian nations, primarily
Vietnam and the Philippines, due to disputes over territorial rights in the
South China Sea.
The South China Sea has long been a source of tension between China and
other Southeast Asian nations. The United Nations (UN) attempted to ease
these tensions in its 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, which granted
countries in the region rights to marine and energy resources within a certain
range of their coast. This was meant to give all countries in the region some
claim to vital trade routes and to the vast energy resources believed to exist
there. China disputes the UN-granted rights and stakes a historical claim to
almost the entire South China Sea.
Tensions really boiled over in May 2014 when a Chinese state-owned
energy company placed an oil rig, HD-981, in Vietnamese territorial
waters. The rig was deployed close to the Paracel Islands, which are
claimed by both China and Vietnam. The presence of the rig precipitated
continuous clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels, violent
protests of Chinese businesses in Vietnam, and elevated tensions
between China and other nations in the region such as the Philippines.
It was during this time in May 2014 when China-based targeted intrusion
activity against entities in Southeast Asia increased significantly.
The uptick was likely due to Chinese interest in monitoring reaction
of government and other organizations in the region. Numerous
adversaries (primarily GOBLIN PANDA, VIXEN PANDA, LOTUS PANDA,
PREDATOR PANDA, and PIRATE PANDA) and numerous malware variants
(PlugX, Poison Ivy, Mirage, Enfal, and Naikon) were observed being used in
these operations.

CrowdStrike Intelligence observed that GOBLIN PANDA and VIXEN PANDA
were the adversaries most actively targeting Southeast Asia. GOBLIN
PANDA activity was heavily weighted towards Vietnamese targets. This
adversary used multiple malware variants during this period, but over time
switched over almost entirely to PlugX malware.
Based on the decoy documents used in the incidents, it appears that
Vietnamese government organizations were a primary target (although
private sector targeting of foreign companies was observed as well), as the

decoys were often Vietnamese government documents. The screenshot
below is an example of one of these decoys, with this one related to
Vietnam’s Fisheries Protection Department. A reference to the HD-981 oil
rig can be seen in the first sentence. The C2 domain for the malware used in
conjunction with this document was dns.dubkill.com.

In the regional targeting surrounding these events, VIXEN PANDA activity
was observed focusing mostly on the Philippines, particularly in the area of
defense. Pictured below is a decoy document from an incident identified in
April. The only content is a header marked “Secret” with the letterhead for
the Philippines Naval Operation Center. The malware used in this incident was
Mirage, installed using DLL side-loading, which takes advantage of the search
order the operating system goes through to load DLLs. This particular sample

used NVIDIA-related files often seen with PlugX to side-load the Mirage
payload. The C2 for the malware in this incident was todaynews.dns-dns.com.

The Southeast Asia activity declined dramatically at the end of August,
which coincided with the time that China removed HD-981 from Vietnamese
waters. A slight spike occurred in October when PIRATE PANDA and VIXEN
PANDA stepped up targeting of Vietnam and the Philippines again, possibly
due to arms acquisitions by Vietnam meant to bolster its maritime security
capabilities. Since that time, sporadic activity with a Southeast Asia focus
was observed, but nothing at a sustained level like that which was observed
from May to October.
It is highly likely that tensions will increase again as the disputes over
territory and resources in the South China Sea remain unresolved.

DEEP PANDA Think Tank Targeting
In July 2014, CrowdStrike publicly reported on malicious
activity linked to the DEEP PANDA adversary at two U.S.11 http://blog.crowdstrike.com/

based think tanks.11 This activity followed typical DEEP

what, at the time, was a novel technique utilizing PowerShell to download
MadHatter malware on victim machines. Although the TTPs were typical,
the specific targeting at each institution provided insight into how these
adversaries may be tasked in their operations.
Analysis of each incident revealed that, up until mid-June 2014, the
adversary was focused on experts on Asian and Chinese policy at each
affected institution. This targeting is consistent with the objectives likely
imposed on Chinese intelligence collection during this time in support of
global intelligence collection surrounding the ongoing HD-981 incident.
During mid-June, DEEP PANDA clearly and immediately shifted focus from
Asia-related issues to Middle East-related issues. This shift coincided with a
significant uptick in attacks from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),
particularly an attack on the Baiji oil refinery in Iraq.
At one institution, the actor focused on a target with expertise in China’s
natural resource consumption and energy sourcing requirements. Additional
targets at this institution included an executive assistant and network
engineers and administrators. The targeting of an executive assistant would
likely provide access to information on high-level strategy and operational
information, and targeting of network administrators would provide
information useful in lateral movement and establishing persistence.
At the second institution, targeted individuals had extensive careers in the
U.S. government and intelligence community, had written on U.S. Middle East
policy, and had given congressional testimony on ISIS issues. The targets
in this instance could provide information on potential U.S. strategy and
possibly even communications between the institution and U.S.
government entities.
The rapid pivot between individuals at these institutions focused on Asia
issues to individuals focused on Middle East issues shows how quickly these
adversaries are able to react to new tasking. The targeting in these cases
appear to be in line with interests of government organizations who would
desire information on strategic options that the U.S. might be considering
with respect to ISIS. Information from these kinds of institutions would also
be useful to companies doing business in the Middle East.

World Cup
The biggest event of the year in terms of media coverage and sheer global
attention was the FIFA World Cup played in Brazil between 12 June and 13

for purposes of deceiving targets into credentials theft, compromise of
networks for espionage, and other objectives.
CrowdStrike covered the run-up to the World Cup with reporting that
outlined potential threats to the event. Chief among these was that of

Effect of Public Reporting on Adversary Activity
In the 2013 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike
discussed a Russian adversary designated
ENERGETIC BEAR. Beginning in July 2014, several
security vendors disclosed additional information
on this actor.
This adversary has previously demonstrated more than a basic
awareness of operational security (OPSEC). Unsurprisingly,
ENERGETIC BEAR quickly abandoned their compromised website
C2 infrastructure they had acquired for these operations. Although
infected machines would continue to beacon to the C2 servers, no
further tasking would be provided.
Since the public disclosures, no new builds of the malware used
by ENERGETIC BEAR – primarily the Havex and SYSMain RATs –
have been observed. This toolset has seen several evolutionary
developments over a period spanning at least five years, and its
loss is likely to cause the adversary to enter a retooling phase. The
underlying intelligence requirements driving their operations are
unlikely to change, however, and it is likely that ENERGETIC BEAR
will re-emerge with a new toolset in the future.
In June 2014, CrowdStrike published13 public reporting detailing the
attribution of an adversary designated as PUTTER PANDA to the
12th Bureau of the 3rd General Staff Department of the People’s
Liberation Army, also known as Unit 61486. This attribution was
facilitated by one of the PUTTER PANDA operators providing
pictures of the unit’s operational base on social media, using
accounts that could be associated with C2 domains – a serious
OPSEC mistake. After the publication of CrowdStrike’s report, the
social media account containing photos of the unit’s base was
deleted, and PUTTER PANDA appears to have stopped using the

13 http://resources.crowdstrike.com/putterpanda/

tools previously identified by CrowdStrike.

49

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Know
the

Another significant public disclosure of an adversary group was the
publication of a report on Unit 61398 (a.k.a. COMMENT PANDA) in
February 2013. While this group also initially “went dark” following
the report’s public release, there have been indications that this
actor was in operation again by October 2013.
The disclosure of information regarding ongoing operations has
been hotly contested in the information security community. Many
attribute such disclosures to marketing or other self-promoting
behavior. While the motivations surrounding public disclosures are
certainly open to discussion, these observations indicate that public
disclosures to date have had a significant impact on advanced
adversary operations.
It is becoming apparent that the priorities levied by organizations
sponsoring cyber espionage are unaffected by such disclosures.
It is highly likely that groups who have been publicly reported on
will return to the same activities with new toolsets, if they have not
already. CrowdStrike’s approach to public disclosure balances the
benefits of disrupting operations with the risk of losing visibility into
adversary actions by driving a change in TTPs.
This balance is accomplished by looking at the existing publicly
available reporting, and what the likely reaction by the adversary
is. This is then reviewed in terms of Intelligence Gain/Loss (IGL);
among other things, this includes the potential intelligence value of
a disclosure, what are potential impacts to visibility of the adversary,
and how does this impact the ability to protect customers? Forcing
the adversary to retool means the cost of doing business has gone
up; they must invest in new tools, infrastructure, and potentially
training, which may have consequences for how brazen the
adversary will be in the future.

HURRICANE PANDA
HURRICANE PANDA is an advanced China-based adversary actively
targeting Internet services, engineering, and aerospace companies.

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Know
the
Adversary

Since February 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed
HURRICANE PANDA leverage at least two zero-day exploits, a
unique DNS resolution technique, and tools traditionally used by
Chinese actors. Once inside a victim’s network, this adversary
seeks to gain legitimate credentials to move laterally and establish
RDP sessions to achieve their objectives. Based on their technical
capabilities, HURRICANE PANDA is currently one of the most
advanced Chinese actors tracked by CrowdStrike.
Zero-days, Exploits, and Web Vulnerabilities
As stated above, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed HURRICANE
PANDA leveraging two zero-day exploits, indicating that this
adversary has above-average capability or access to exploit
developers. First, in February 2014 this actor was observed using
SWC tactics to gain initial footholds into victim networks via CVE2014-0322. Successful exploitation during this campaign led victims
to install the Sakula malware. Much of the targeting in this campaign
appeared to be against the French aerospace sector.14
In October 2014, HURRICANE PANDA used CVE-2014-4113 to
escalate privileges on already-compromised 64-bit Windows
machines.15 Their exploitation of this vulnerability marked the first
time it was observed in the wild.
In addition to zero-day exploits, HURRICANE PANDA has also used
three other privilege-escalation exploits and another remote code
execution exploit.
Finally, in another case, HURRICANE PANDA gained initial access
to a victim via a SQL injection vulnerability. They then used the

vulnerability to upload a simple Chopper webshell script to gain
additional access, move laterally to the corporate network, and
install additional RATs.

The RAT Pack

(RATs). Over the course of the year, CrowdStrike Intelligence
observed this adversary employing Sakula, Gh0st RAT, PlugX, and
HiKit. While Gh0st RAT has been widely available for many years,
the other RATs have exclusively been tied to China-based actors.
This actor also made extensive use of Chopper webshell; this
provides the equivalent functionality of a RAT for adversary control
of webservers. Chopper can exist in a rather simple form:

<?php eval($_POST[“chopper”]); ?>
where “chopper” is an attacker-selected password of sorts. This
simple one-line script gives an attacker access to a webserver from
which they can deploy privilege-escalation tools, move laterally,
or deploy more complex scripts to interact with databases on the
webserver.
While PlugX usage has increased significantly over the past year
among China-based actors, HURRICANE PANDA’s usage of the
tool was notable for two reasons. First, when configuring PlugX,
the attacker is given the option of using up to four DNS servers
of their choosing. Knowing this, HURRICANE PANDA discovered
a unique service offered by California-based Internet service
provider Hurricane Electric. By abusing Hurricane Electric’s free
DNS service, the actors were able to resolve popular domains like
www.pinterest.com, adobe.com, and github.com. Using legitimate
domains presumably would fool incident responders into believing
the communications were benign.
HURRICANE PANDA leveraged PlugX’s custom DNS feature to use
the free DNS hosting services provided by Hurricane Electric to
resolve these domains to PlugX C2 nodes instead of their legitimate
IP addresses. Hurricane Electric quickly took action to prevent the
abuse that allowed DNS resolution for legitimate domains.

the string. The decoded string contains the protocol over which
to communicate, as well as the IP address and port pair. When the
above strings are decoded, the following IP addresses are used as
PlugX C2 servers:

•

•

202.181.133.237

•

61.78.34.179

•

203.135.134.243

Post-Exploitation and Exfiltration
After HURRICANE PANDA has established a foothold on a victim’s
network, they then seek legitimate credentials via tools such
as Windows Credential Viewer, Windows Credential Editor, or
Mimikatz. Once credentials have been obtained, the actor tends to
use these for access to the network instead of interacting with their
RAT, thus reducing their footprint and allowing them to appear as
legitimate VPN users.
If credentials cannot be obtained, HURRICANE PANDA will often
rely on RDP. First, they will replace the sticky keys file (using the
sethc.exe hack16) with a copy of their preferred Chinese version of
cmd.exe on the victim machine. Then they will access the victim
computer over RDP, and, when presented with a login screen, IT
will invoke the sticky keys mechanism and be presented with an
administrative command shell. Furthermore, PlugX contains a
reverse-RDP tunneling capability that HURRICANE PANDA has
employed.
Exfiltration by HURRICANE PANDA follows a simple pattern often
performed by China-based adversaries. First, files of interest are
16 http://blog.crowdstrike.com/adversary-tricks-crowdstrike-treats/

compressed and password protected using RAR. Next, they stage
the files at a convenient location. Finally, they exfiltrate the files
from the network via FTP.

Possible Connections to AURORA PANDA
CrowdStrike Intelligence is currently evaluating possible
connections between HURRICANE PANDA and AURORA PANDA.
There is currently no definitive link, but indicators of compromise
linked to AURORA PANDA have been discovered on networks
also compromised by HURRICANE PANDA. Other connections
include: similar toolsets, access to zero-day exploits, and possible
infrastructure connections.
HURRICANE PANDA is among the more capable China-based
adversaries, and run-ins with this actor should be treated with the
utmost concern.

GOTHIC PANDA
GOTHIC PANDA is another advanced Chinese adversary that
CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked throughout 2014. This adversary
has been observed targeting a number of high-profile victims in
key sectors including financial, technology, NGO/international, and
energy.
In early May 2014, CrowdStrike observed this adversary mounting

In addition to targeting of individuals within targeted organizations,
phishing messages from this adversary were observed being sent
to mailing lists for specialized topics such as high-performance
computing, weather metadata software, and pre-medical programs
at educational institutions.
An observed phishing message is show below:

Victims in these campaigns were infected with the implant known
by the anti-virus name Pirpi, which has been seen in use since 2009.
Pirpi provides the adversary with a traditional set of RAT features
that allow the adversary to exfiltrate and deploy files, along with
remote shell access to a compromised system.
GOTHIC PANDA is considered by CrowdStrike Intelligence to be
one of the more advanced adversaries tracked. Over time, the Pirpi
implant has improved to feature more aggressive anti-analysis
techniques, and the network communication with control servers
has improved to hinder network-based detection.
While investigating GOTHIC PANDA, CrowdStrike Intelligence
identified a strong code overlap between the Pirpi implant and

56

a defunct malware known by the anti-virus name Dreammon (or
DreamClick). This malware possesses a feature set more in line
with adclicker malware rather than targeted activity. As adclicker
malware is more common with criminal adversaries, it has been
postulated that if the same adversary behind Dreammon is
behind Pirpi, this adversary’s initial motives may have been
financially driven.

Overview of Russian Threat Actors
Although the Chinese calendar predicted that 2014 would be the
Year of the Horse, in many respects 2014 has been the Year of the
Bear in the cyber realm, with several high-profile Russia-based
actors receiving public attention. The reported activity has included
actors tracked by CrowdStrike as ENERGETIC BEAR, FANCY BEAR,
and VENOMOUS BEAR, as well as other sets such as Sandworm,
which uses the Black Energy toolset in targeted attacks, in contrast
to its normal use as criminal malware. CrowdStrike also tracks
other adversaries attributed to Russia under cryptonyms such
as BERSERK BEAR, BOULDER BEAR, and the financial-crimemotivated actor MAGNETIC SPIDER.
VENOMOUS BEAR, also known as Snake, Turla, and Oroborous, uses
a set of implants that culminates in a sophisticated Windows-based
rootkit that can leverage an encrypted Virtual File System (VFS) as
a staging area for tools to deploy and data prepared for exfiltration.
It also includes implants for other platforms such as Linux that
can be used to operate command-and-control infrastructure.
External reporting indicates a targeting bias toward entities in the
government sector, along with the use of zero-day exploits. These
TTPs, along with the maturity of the attacker’s toolset, indicate that
this is a highly sophisticated adversary.
FANCY BEAR is CrowdStrike’s name for an adversary also known
as Sofacy. Although the tools used by this actor are not as complex
as those employed by VENOMOUS BEAR, they share a common
targeting focus on government and military entities, with a particular

57

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

emphasis on Russia’s “near abroad” regions such as Eastern Europe.
As well as implants for Windows, Linux, and mobile operating
systems, FANCY BEAR employs credential phishing attacks,
spoofing legitimate sites to harvest the details of users of interest.
Proactive analysis during 2014 revealed another Russian actor that
has not encountered public exposure, yet appears to have been
tasked by Russian state interests. BERSERK BEAR has conducted
operations from 2004 through to the present day, primarily aimed
at collecting intelligence but has also provided capability in support
of offensive operations in parallel to the Russia/Georgia conflict in
August 2008.
ENERGETIC BEAR has been tracked by CrowdStrike since 2012. The
adversary initially focused on targets in the energy sector, but more
recently had branched out to attempt to compromise financial,
industrial, and commercial organizations. This corresponded with
a shift from primarily using SWC attack vectors to targeted email
attacks. Analysis of ENERGETIC BEAR’s post-exploitation activity
revealed the use of custom tools for credential harvesting, network
enumeration, and interaction with industrial automation equipment.

FANCY BEAR
In the second half of 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence analyzed the
targeted attack activity of a particularly interesting Russian actor
named FANCY BEAR. The campaigns conducted by this actor
target high-profile military and government entities in a variety
of countries, most notably political institutions of former Soviet
nations as well as Eastern European countries, NATO institutions,
and organizations of western countries. Technical indicators, such
as the resource locales and C2 domain registrant information,
exhibit references to a Russian-speaking adversary. In addition,
the targeting is consistent with strategic interests of the Russian
Federation.

58

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Know
the
Adversary

two thousand fourteen

Targeting of high-profile entities requires mature and versatile
technical means. FANCY BEAR exhibits a consistent level of
technical sophistication with respect to its tools, and the actor is
characterized by a thorough preparation of attacks and required
infrastructure. Their main implant, called X-Agent, is a sophisticated
RAT that exhibits a modular architecture and a multi-year
development history. As a consequence, the adversary can combine
the necessary implant functionality on a per-target basis, spanning
multiple operating systems and mobile platforms.
A remarkable feature only seen with some of the well-engineered
and mature targeted attack malware is the following: If required,
the implant can switch the carrier protocol for its command-andcontrol channel ranging from HTTP over email to removable media.
The latter is specifically suited for target environments that do not
have direct network connectivity to a C2 node and instead rely on
periodic use of USB removable media to bridge air gaps. In addition,
recent incidents involved heavily obfuscated malware including code
flow obfuscation, likely another step taken in order to hinder analysis
efforts. All of these underline a clear targeted attack mission.

Predicting what will happen in 2015 is
a challenge, as unforeseen events will
inevitably occur and new TTPs from
adversaries across the motivational
spectrum will continue to shape the threat
environment. Before exploring what may
be coming in 2015, a brief look back at the
predictions for 2014 is in order.
Last year, CrowdStrike made a number of predictions about the
2014 threat landscape, many of which came to fruition:
• North Korean Activity – CrowdStrike Intelligence predicted that
North Korea might use its cyber operations to project power
during 2014. This prediction came to fruition at the end of 2014
when a North Korean adversary attacked Sony because of one of
the studio’s movies that North Korea perceived as an act of war.
• Windows XP End of Life – Targeted attackers did use exploits
such CVE-2014-1776 to target out-of-life Windows XP machines.
This continues to be a significant risk, as the existence of legacy
Windows XP machines continues to expose an attack surface.
•T
 hird-Party Targeting – 2013 saw actors targeting third-party
vendors offering DNS, social media, and content management
services in order to attack customers of those services. As one
example, CrowdStrike observed a number of attacks by the
HURRICANE PANDA adversary against DNS and hosting providers
in 2014; these attacks were highly likely used to ultimately target
those providers’ customers.
•S
 andbox-Aware Malware – The use of sandbox-aware malware
was not new to 2014, but adversaries did make significant use
of malware variants capable of detecting if they were being
run in sandbox environments. These techniques ranged from
detection of sandboxes through system and network artifacts,
detection of user activity, and even prompting user interaction as
a countermeasure.

•U
 se of High-Level Languages – The 2014 yearly report noted
a downward trend in the use of low-level languages like C and
a growing trend in the use of high-level languages like C# and
Python. During 2014, CrowdStrike did observe several adversaries
such as VICEROY TIGER making heavy use of a malware variant
that primarily leveraged Python script.
•A
 ctivity in the Physical World – Physical world conflict often leads
to related cyber operations, and 2014 was no different. A number
of conflicts in the physical space such as those in the South China
Sea, Ukraine, and the Middle East all resulted in related cyber
operations by targeted intrusion adversaries in China, Russia, and
Iran, as well as nationalist and hacktivist actors.
2015 will undoubtedly hold many surprises and new developments
in the realm of computer security. The following section contains
estimative judgments about what may be likely trends or
occurrences in the next year.

Research and Development
Research and development during one year can often set the
expectations and direction of the next. With this in mind, the
CrowdStrike Intelligence team carefully observed patterns and
trends in the security research community. Based on the trends of
2014, the following estimates were developed:
• It is expected that Let’s Encrypt, the first free certificate authority
with a pre-installed root certificate in major browsers, will launch in
2015. This service will offer very simple command line provisioning
of certificates for use in HTTPS. As a result of the ease of use and
availability, it is likely that an increasing amount of Internet traffic
will be encrypted. As HTTP traffic becomes less common, it is
more likely to be suspect and subject to closer inspection. This
opens the possibility that more adversaries may look to leverage
SSL certificates for command and control. Additionally, Content
Security Policy (CSP) for webpages means that XSS-attacks will
become more complicated to mount. In 2015, it is expected that

62

two-factor authentication will be more widely deployed across
enterprise and cloud services, which will hopefully hamper the
effectiveness of credential and banking phishing operations.
• Adversaries are constantly advancing their capabilities; overseas,
cryptography and its application has continued to dominate the
technology news, beginning with revelations from the Snowden
leaks. CrowdStrike assesses it is possible that adversaries will
deploy more sophisticated encryption and key agreement
schemes to hamper interception by security professionals and
intelligence services.
• In 2015, a number of sandboxes using hypervisor introspection
will become available, both commercially and in open source.
Introspection allows a sandbox to instrument a virtual machine
through the hypervisor; this provides additional stealth to the
sandbox, allowing it to avoid detection. It remains to be seen
whether malware authors will completely cease their efforts to
detect traditional sandboxing solution and/or whether they will try
to subvert introspection-based sandboxes. Given the difficulty in
detection, and the speed at which new technologies are adopted,
it is likely that adversaries will continue to detect traditional
sandboxes in 2015, with more advanced adversaries exploring
techniques to identify or evade introspection-based systems.
• Embedded devices, regardless of whether they are home routers
or industrial control systems, will be increasingly targeted. One
of the primary factors impacting this belief is the increasing pace
of vulnerability disclosures in the embedded space and in the
underlying software they leverage. The increasing prevalence and
popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, discussed in more
detail below, is another factor in this likely targeting. This targeting
will likely occur across a variety of threat actors. In 2014, we saw
the compromise of home router technology used to build an
embedded proxy layer used to mask the identity of the attacker.

63

• Internet of Things (IoT) devices are still in their infancy and the
concept of IoT has not yet become widely adopted or even
available to the average end user. There are, however, a large
number of devices being sold already that would fit under the IoT
umbrella, even if they do not make use of the IoT communication
standards. While targeted attacks against IoT devices are unlikely
at this time, the potential to abuse IoT devices for amplified DDOS
as well as disrupting IoT networks through DOS’ing of central
control infrastructure might well be possible.

Outlook for China-Based Adversaries
China is, by now, well known for conducting cyber espionage
campaigns focused on accessing intelligence about intellectual
property, mergers and acquisitions, and technologies highlighted
in its Five-Year plans. Targeting these technologies and strategic
business information allow its domestic companies to rapidly make
“leap frog” developments, and to benefit from favorable bargaining
positions, thus elevating them to become global leaders. This
behavior is expected to continue in 2015, as will continued targeting
of foreign government entities in an attempt to access information
related to the global strategy and plans of these countries.
China is expected to continue to leverage this espionage as a means
to conduct intelligence collection to support its aspirations to
further push the envelope on its territorial claims. This is particularly
true in the South China Sea (SCS) conflicts with Vietnam and the
Philippines, and the Senkaku/Diaoyu island dispute with Japan.
China has already undertaken substantial construction of manmade
islands in the SCS to begin projecting its power, and as its Navy
continues to grow, it will only seek to push further beyond its
current boundaries. China is aggressively moving forward with the
design and implementation of its own aircraft carriers, which will
no doubt have an impact in this regional issue, allowing the PRC to
project force and intimidate its neighbors.

Taiwan will continue to play a very important role in the potential
conflicts to come, not only as a testing ground for malware, but as
the main focus for expanding Chinese territorial claims. The PRC
views Taiwan as an inalienable part of China that will eventually
be reunited for the greater good of both peoples and therefore
places it above other territorial conflicts. Taiwan’s recent shift
towards a decidedly less-Beijing-friendly, DPP-led government is
of great concern to China and will be a major factor in how China
uses technology to facilitate its political maneuverings. Taiwan has
historically been penetrated by PRC intelligence services at all
levels, which makes cyber one of the first visible indicators of PRC
intentions regarding Taiwan.
China has also made significant headway on projecting its “soft
power” abroad via multiple billion-dollar investments, particularly
in the sectors of communications and transportation infrastructure.
For years, China has been making inroads in Africa to provide
the vast majority of the continent’s telecommunication systems,
but only recently have some of the more sinister intentions been
brought to light.
In December 2014, approximately
77 Chinese nationals were found
to be running a sophisticated
command center out of a house in
Nairobi, Kenya, which appeared to
be capable of targeting the main
communication systems in the
capital. A building with multiple
large satellites that appears to be
annexed to the Chinese embassy in

Paris was also recently reported on
and believed to be connected to
the 3PLA’s 8th Bureau, Unit 61046,
which is responsible for SIGINT
collection on western Europe.

There has also been a significant amount of investment poured
into transportation projects, particularly high-speed rail (HSR)
lines, in multiple countries. China has already planned to merge its
two top train makers into a HSR juggernaut capable of building
massive rail lines around the world. To this end, China has submitted
bids for massive rail projects in Nigeria, and nearly won (this was
subsequently canceled) another project in Mexico. China has
also suggested massive lines between Beijing and Moscow and
constructing a line between Delhi and Chennai in India. Beijing also
remains interested in proposals for HSRs in Britain and California,
and has already made headway on construction of a HungarySerbian HSR that will connect Belgrade to Budapest.
In total, the projects proposed by China would give it control of
more than 40,000 km, giving it significant control over the world’s
transportation routes. It seems fairly likely that, given China’s
previous use of espionage against foreign companies (which it has
used to gain advantages in competitive bidding and mergers &
acquisitions), there is a substantial motivation for China to follow
suit in the coming year as it looks to secure its position as the global
leader in HSR construction.

Joint Plan of Action Could Possibly
Drive Iranian Cyber Attacks
The Iranian Joint Plan of Action (JPOA), its delay, and its ultimate
desired path by politicians to negotiate a Comprehensive Plan
of Action (CPOA) are preeminent issues in the global press and
political circles. The JPOA is a temporary agreement made between
Iran and an intergovernmental negotiating body consisting of China,
France, the Russian Federation, the Unßited Kingdom, the United
States and Germany. The agreement was originally intended to be
a six-month period in which the Iranian government would reduce
its stockpile of enriched uranium fuel and suspend specific aspects
of its nuclear energy programs in exchange for the UN Security
Council relaxing of specific sanctions previously imposed against
Iran. During this time of suspended nuclear research activities and

66

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

eased sanctions, negotiating parties would discuss the details of a
more permanent agreement, known as the Comprehensive Plan of
Action (CPOA).
The JPOA could be a driver or tipping point for future cyber
attacks by Iran against western targets. Iran has publicly noted
the understanding that negotiations can be influenced and has
demonstrated historically that it is willing (and has capabilities)
to conduct cyber operations to influence negotiations if it sees fit
to do so. It has been publicly speculated that Iran has conducted
retaliatory attacks, notably the Shamoon incident in 2012.
Recent open-source activities in the Iranian underground suggest
Iran may be attempting to structure or resource for possible future
cyber operations. There have been visibility changes with regard
to information surrounding Iranian hackers, as well as forums and
websites. Popular forums for Iranian hackers ISCN and Shabgard
have been shut down and are no longer publicly accessible.
Despite the shutdowns, there will likely be little change to the
communication occurring between affiliated hackers in closed
communications pathways. The closing of these forums could be in
anticipation of future malicious activity and a desire to decrease the
public profile of individuals in the Iranian underground.
There are also clear links between the Iranian government hacking
contests intended to identify hackers with advanced skills and
to learn advanced methods of network intrusion. For example,
in November 2013, just before the JPOA agreement was signed,
Sharif University of Technology conducted a contest for “innovative
methods” of computer network intrusions and defense against
such intrusions. Based on the contest announcements, Iranian
government cyber security authorities had access to the students’
submissions in the contest, and those submissions were not
released to the public but rather kept private to only those with
access to the contest submissions.

Iranian adversaries such as ROCKET KITTEN, FLYING KITTEN,
and CHARMING KITTEN were quite active during 2014 targeting
western governments and companies. The motivation to attack
such targets will only increase during 2015. However, should the
process around the JPOA and CPOA take a turn that Iran perceives
as disadvantageous, the motivation will likely greatly increase.
Recent revelations indicate that ROCKET KITTEN may have, in fact,
targeted the JPOA negotiations using spear phishing that may have
targeted diplomats involved in the meetings.

Cyber Spillover from Regional Conflicts
Last year’s report included cyber spillover as something to look for
in 2014, and it will be equally as important in 2015. Increasingly, realworld physical conflicts are carrying with them associated cyber
components. Sometimes the related cyber operations are carried
out by entities directly engaged in the conflict, and other times
entities not directly involved will engage in cyber operations in an
attempt to support one side or the other. It is not possible to predict
all possible conflicts in 2015, but there are three primary areas to
keep an eye on.
The conflict that may see the most significant uptick in associated
activity is the one centered around ISIS. The Syrian civil war saw
quite a bit of associated cyber operations against western targets
in 2013, many of which were attributed to the DEADEYE JACKAL
adversary (Syrian Electronic Army). Since that time, the ISIS
terrorist group has become a significant threat in the region and
appears to be capable of bringing resources to bear to carry out
malicious cyber attacks.
Already, in early January 2015, a group calling itself CyberCaliphate
and declaring support for ISIS hacked the social media presence of
U.S. Central Command and used it to spread Islamist propaganda.
It is likely that this and other related groups supporting the Islamist
cause will engage in operations that support ISIS objectives. Most
of this activity is likely to be a nuisance, such as defacements and

68

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Looking
Forward

two thousand fourteen

low-level DDOS attacks, but it is possible that more advanced actors
could carry out targeted or even destructive attacks.
The South China Sea will be an area to continue to watch in 2015.
As discussed above, tensions in this area drove a great deal of
targeted intrusion activity from China-based adversaries in 2014.
Tensions subsided toward the end of 2014, but the region is rich in
natural resources and countries there, particularly China, are eager
to lay claim to those resources. Because of this, there is a significant
possibility that the conflict will flare up again in the coming year.
One thing that could temper the possibility for conflict is if oil
prices remain low, making oil exploration in the area potentially less
lucrative.
Ukraine is the third region to keep an eye on for possible cyber
spillover in 2015. The physical conflict there already spilled over
into cyberspace, as was discussed above. So long as the Ukrainian
conflict remains unresolved and foreign governments continue to
exert pressure on Russia via economic sanctions, expect continued
Russian targeting of governments, particularly those in Europe and
the U.S.
Another related contributing factor to Russian cyber operations is
the falling price of oil. Russia’s economy is deeply dependent on oil
prices. The precipitous fall in the price of oil at the end of 2014 and
going into 2015 has already caused a great deal of economic turmoil
in Russia. An extended period of low oil prices could result in
increased malicious cyber activity from Russian adversaries against
foreign governments and private sector organizations.

The Future for PoS Attacks
PoS malware experienced a great deal of success during 2014,
however upcoming changes may force changes in paymentprocessing systems in the U.S. For example, several major credit
card companies are expected to institute new policies in October
2015 that will shift liability for fraudulent transactions to whomever

69

is using the weakest payment-processing systems. The purpose
of this is to drive retailers to adopt EMV (Europay, MasterCard,
and Visa) standards, which entail chip and PIN cards that use a
combination of the traditional PIN number and an embedded
microchip that encrypts vital information. This type of card offers a
more secure payment card solution for consumers.
Additionally, several alternative solutions, such as Apple Pay and
Google Wallet, have started becoming adopted, allowing for
payment via token systems. In theses systems, rather than a card
number being transmitted, a one-time token is passed from a
consumer’s device to the retailer. The advantage to this system is
that in the event of the token being obtained by an unauthorized
party, it cannot be reused for later transactions.
Adoption of these newer payment processes should provide
consumers with more secure payment methods and make it more
difficult for criminals seeking to make money off these systems.
There will be some lag time in 2015 as retailers and banks move to
put these improvements in place, during which cybercriminals will
still be able to exploit the current, antiquated payment processing
systems in the U.S. However, the newer processes, once in place,
should lead to a decline in the type of PoS attacks seen over
the past year.
Despite this decline, it is almost certain that the implementation
of more secure methods will lead cybercriminals to develop
more sophisticated means by which to attack paymentprocessing systems.

Destructive and Disruptive Attacks
Destructive attacks (such as those carried out by SILENT
CHOLLIMA) and disruptive attacks (such as the DDOS activity
against gaming platforms) garnered headlines at the end of 2014.
The high-profile nature of these attacks does not necessarily
indicate that they will grow in popularity in 2015, however it is

70

CrowdStrike
Global Threat Intel Report

Looking
Forward

two thousand fourteen

possible that the success of these attacks may encourage other
groups to engage in destructive or disruptive operations to
advance their interests.
As an example of this, a series of disruptive attacks in December
targeted online gaming platforms. These attacks manifested in the
form of DDOS operations carried out by the LizardSquad group
briefly discussed above. The attacks came in two waves, the first of
which was in early December when the Xbox Live and PlayStation
networks were knocked offline for a short period of time. The
second wave of attacks occurred on 25 December 2014 when the
Xbox and PlayStation online platforms suffered more outages that
LizardSquad claimed responsibility for. CrowdStrike Intelligence
is also aware of DDOS threats against other gaming platforms
including Valve Software, which appeared to be targeted by a DNS
amplification DDOS attack that is similar to previous
LizardSquad activity.
Malicious actors have already engaged in disruptive campaigns in
early 2015. Following the January terrorist attacks in France, a group
of Islamist hackers known as Fallaga conducted DDOS attacks
against servers hosting websites for French foreign embassies. Soon
after, another Islamist group identifying with ISIS took control of
the Twitter and YouTube accounts for U.S. Central Command and
posted a number of messages threatening U.S. troops and their
families.
Organizations in all sectors should be aware of, and prepared
for, destructive and disruptive attacks. These operations are
often motivated by a specific grievance, but sometimes no clear
motivation can be established. Continuous monitoring for publicized
threats against an organization, or for potential areas of controversy
that could motivate malicious activity, is vital to detect and prepare
for these types of attacks.

Conclusion
The question now is:
How do you incorporate
intelligence into your
daily defenses and
prioritize resources based
on risk to your business?

Conclusion

two thousand fourteen

In the course of reviewing 2014, there were so many
interesting events, adversaries, and innovations that
selecting examples for this report was an incredible
challenge. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team spent
much time narrowing the scope of topics covered
herein. The adversaries in 2014 proved, if nothing else,
to be dynamic, persistent, and innovative. Defenders
must be inventive, diligent, and decisive in their efforts
to defend the enterprise from these attackers.
2015 will be a continuation of the cat-and-mouse
game that is played between the adversary and
the defender. Adversaries across the motivational
spectrum will continue to evolve their tactics in
order to achieve their objectives. Although tactics
may evolve, network defenders will be able to have
success against the adversary so long as they are well
prepared.
Intelligence will provide the decisive advantage
to both sides, and having a good defense will
be predicated on having an informed, intelligent
defensive team. The incorporation of intelligence into
the daily defense of the enterprise will continue to
be paramount and products, services, and solution
providers will need to use this intelligence to stay
ahead of the adversary.
At CrowdStrike, intelligence powers everything we do,
and as 2015 unfolds, organizations using intelligence
will be better prepared to detect, deter, and defend
against their adversaries.
