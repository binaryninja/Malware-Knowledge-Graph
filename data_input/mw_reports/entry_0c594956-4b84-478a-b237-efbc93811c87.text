What is
Magecart?

Also known as digital skimming, this crime has surged since 2015. Criminals steal
card data during online shopping. Who are behind these notorious hacks, how does it
work, and how have Magecart attacks evolved over time?
About Magecart

The Indonesian police announced on Friday that they have arrested three alleged Magecart
hackers on December 20th. The suspects are from Jakarta and Yogyakarta and are 23, 26
and 35 years old. After the press conference, one suspect admitted on Indonesian

television that he had injected web skimmers into ecommerce stores since 2017 and only
made enough money to “buy a jacket”. The suspects face up to 10 years in prison under
article 363 of the Indonesian Criminal Code.
The Indonesian police reported that this group had intercepted payments for 12 (mostly
European) stores. The arrests carried out by Indonesian police were part of a coordinated
Interpol anti-skimming campaign called Operation Night Fury with support from European
and US cyberteams.

571 stores hacked, suspects still at large
Sansec has been tracking the activity of this group for several years and has identified not
12 but 571 hacks by the same individuals. These hacks could be attributed because of an
odd message that was left in all of the skimming code:

“Success gan !” translates to “Success bro” in Indonesian and has been present for years
on all of their skimming infrastructure.
The hackers registered a range of domain names for their skimming operations, some of
them clearly referring to their whereabouts or intentions. Here is a small sample:
trustme.web.id
bikin.id
nganuenak.com ("delicious")
bakulsemprul.com (a cafetaria on Kalimantan)
adventurewar.com
ride4speed.com
magecart.net

Furthermore, we have observed similar hacks since the arrest at December 20th. The
Indonesian police confirms that suspects from the same group are still at large, but would
not disclose further details. As of today, we found 27 stores that are still being skimmed
using the same code. Several exfiltration servers are still actively collecting intercepted
payments, notably the brazen magecart.net domain.

End of Magecart?
This group had a serious impact on global ecommerce security in recent years, by
skimming at least 571 hacked stores. However, they were responsible for just 1% of all
Magecart incidents since 2017. Sansec estimates that there are yet another 40 to 50 more
sophisticated individuals involved in web-skimming activity.
