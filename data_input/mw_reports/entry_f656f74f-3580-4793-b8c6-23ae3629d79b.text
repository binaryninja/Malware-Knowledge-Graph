Threat Analysis Group

As part of TAG's mission to counter serious threats to Google and our users, we've published
analysis on a range of persistent threats including government-backed attackers, commercial
surveillance vendors, and serious criminal operators. Today, we're sharing intelligence on a
segment of attackers we call hack-for-hire, whose niche focuses on compromising accounts
and exfiltrating data as a service.
In contrast to commercial surveillance vendors, who we generally observe selling a capability
for the end user to operate, hack-for-hire firms conduct attacks themselves. They target a
wide range of users and opportunistically take advantage of known security flaws when
undertaking their campaigns. Both, however, enable attacks by those who would otherwise
lack the capabilities to do so.

We have seen hack-for-hire groups target human rights and political activists, journalists, and
other high-risk users around the world, putting their privacy, safety and security at risk. They
also conduct corporate espionage, handily obscuring their clients’ role.
To help users and defenders, we will provide examples of the hack-for-hire ecosystem from
India, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates and context around their capabilities and
persistence mechanisms.

How Hack-For-Hire Operations Work
The hack-for-hire landscape is fluid, both in how the attackers organize themselves and in
the wide range of targets they pursue in a single campaign at the behest of disparate clients.
Some hack-for-hire attackers openly advertise their products and services to anyone willing
to pay, while others operate more discreetly selling to a limited audience.
For example, TAG has observed Indian hack-for-hire firms work with third party private
investigative services — intermediaries that reach out for services when a client requires
them — and provide data exfiltrated from a successful operation. This is detailed in depth in
today’s Reuters investigation into the Indian hack-for-hire ecosystem. We have also
observed Indian hack-for-hire firms work with freelance actors not directly employed by the
firms themselves.
The breadth of targets in hack-for-hire campaigns stands in contrast to many governmentbacked operations, which often have a clearer delineation of mission and targets. A recent
campaign from an Indian hack-for-hire operator was observed targeting an IT company in
Cyprus, an education institution in Nigeria, a fintech company in the Balkans and a shopping
company in Israel.

Recent Hack-for-Hire Campaigns
India
Since 2012, TAG has been tracking an interwoven set of Indian hack-for-hire actors, with
many having previously worked for Indian offensive security providers Appin and Belltrox.
One cluster of this activity frequently targets government, healthcare, and telecom sectors in
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain with credential phishing campaigns.
These credential phishing campaigns have ranged from targeting specific government
organizations to AWS accounts to Gmail accounts.

TAG has linked former employees of both Appin and Belltrox to Rebsec, a new firm that
openly advertises corporate espionage as an offering on its company website.

Russia
While investigating a 2017 credential phishing campaign that targeted a prominent Russian
anti-corruption journalist, we discovered the Russian attacker targeting other journalists,
politicians across Europe, and various NGOs and non-profit organizations. But what stuck
out during this investigation was the breadth of targeting, which also included individuals that
had no affiliation with the selected organizations, and appeared to be regular, everyday
citizens in Russia and surrounding countries. This hack-for-hire actor has been publicly
referred to as 'Void Balaur'.
These campaigns were similar regardless of target, consisting of a credential phishing email
with a link to an attacker-controlled phishing page. The lures ranged from fake Gmail and
other webmail provider notifications to messages spoofing Russian government
organizations. After the target account was compromised, the attacker generally maintained
persistence by granting an OAuth token to a legitimate email application like Thunderbird or
generating an App Password to access the account via IMAP. Both OAuth tokens and App
Passwords are revoked when a user changes their password.

Russian hack-for-hire phishing site
During our early investigation, TAG discovered the attacker’s public website (no longer
available) advertising account hacking capabilities for email and social media services. The
site claimed to have received positive reviews on Russian underground forums such as
Dublikat and Probiv.cc. Over the past five years, TAG has observed the group targeting
accounts at major webmail providers like Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo! and regional webmail
providers like abv.bg, mail.ru, inbox.lv, and UKR.net.

United Arab Emirates
TAG is also tracking a hack-for-hire group now based in the United Arab Emirates that is
mostly active in the Middle East and North Africa. They have primarily targeted government,
education, and political organizations including Middle East focused NGOs in Europe and the
Palestinian political party Fatah. Amnesty International has also reported on their campaigns.
The group commonly uses Google or OWA password reset lures to steal credentials from
targets, often using the MailJet or SendGrid API to send phishing emails. Unlike many hackfor-hire actors that use open source phishing frameworks like Evilginx or GoPhish, this group
uses a custom phishing kit that utilizes Selenium, a self described 'suite of tools for
automating web browsers.' Previously described by Amnesty, this phishing kit has remained
under active development over the past five years.

Google Security Alert phishing page
After compromising an account, the actor maintains persistence by granting themselves an
OAuth token to a legitimate email app like Thunderbird, or by linking the victim Gmail
account to an attacker-owned account on a third-party mail provider. The attacker would then
use a custom tool to download the mailbox contents via IMAP.
This group also has links to the original developers of H-Worm, also known as njRAT. In
2014, Microsoft filed a civil suit against the developer, Mohammed Benabdellah, for the
development and dissemination of H-Worm. Benabdellah, who also goes by the moniker
Houdini, has been actively involved in the day-to-day development and operational
deployment of the credential phishing capabilities used by this group since its inception.

Protecting Our Users
As part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, we use results of our research to
improve the safety and security of our products. Upon discovery, all identified websites and
domains were added to Safe Browsing to protect users from further harm. We encourage
any high risk user to enable Advanced Protection and Google Account Level Enhanced Safe
Browsing and ensure that all devices are updated. Additionally, our CyberCrime Investigation
Group is sharing relevant details and indicators with law enforcement.

TAG is committed to sharing our findings as a way of raising awareness with the security
community, and with companies and individuals that might have been targeted. We hope that
improved understanding of the tactics and techniques will enhance threat hunting capability
and lead to stronger user protections across the industry.
