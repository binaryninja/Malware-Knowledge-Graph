The Nexus
of Devices,
Clouds, and
Applications

7

The any-to-any world and the
Internet of Everything is an evolution
in connectivity and collaboration that
is unfolding rapidly. It’s the nexus of
devices, clouds, and applications.
While this evolution is not unexpected,
today’s enterprises may be unprepared
for the reality of navigating an “anyto-any” world—at least, from a security
perspective.
“The crux of the any-to-any issue is
this: We’re quickly reaching the point
where it is increasingly less likely that
a user is going to access a business
through an enterprise network,” says
Chris Young, Senior Vice President of
the Security and Government Group at
Cisco. “More and more, it’s about any
device in any location coming over any
instantiation of the network. Internetenabled devices—smartphones, tablets,
and more—are trying to connect to
applications that could be running
anywhere, including in a public
software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud,
in a private cloud, or in a hybrid cloud.”
At the same time, another evolution
is under way—a steady movement

toward the formation of the “Internet
of Everything.” This is the intelligent
connection of:
• People: Social networks, population
centers, digital entities
• Processes: Systems, business
processes
• Data: World Wide Web, information
• Things: Physical world, devices
and objects

“More and more, it’s about any

“The growth and convergence
of people, processes, data, and
things on the Internet will make
networked connections more
relevant and valuable than
ever before.”
Nancy Cam-Winget, Distinguished
Engineer, Cisco

The Internet of Everything builds on
an “Internet of Things”1 foundation
by adding network intelligence that
allows convergence, orchestration,
and visibility across previously
disparate systems. Connections in
the Internet of Everything aren’t just
about mobile devices or laptops and
desktops, but also the rapidly growing
number of machine-to-machine (M2M)
connections coming online each day.
These “things” are often objects we
take for granted or rely on each day,
and don’t traditionally think of as being
connected—such as a home heating
system, a wind turbine, or a car.
The Internet of Everything is a
future state, to be sure, but is not
so distant when the any-to-any
issue is considered. And while it,
too, will create security challenges
for enterprises, it will bring new
opportunities as well. “Amazing things
will happen and be created as the

Internet of Everything grows,” says
Nancy Cam-Winget, distinguished
engineer, Cisco. “The growth and
convergence of people, processes,
data, and things on the Internet will
make networked connections more
relevant and valuable than ever before.
Ultimately, the Internet of Everything
will create new capabilities, richer
experiences, and unprecedented
economic opportunities for countries,
businesses, and individuals.”

How the Cloud
Complicates Security
The challenge of securing a wide
range of applications, devices, and
users—whether in an “any-to-any” or
Internet of Everything context—is made
tougher by the popularity of the cloud
as a means of managing enterprise
systems. According to data compiled
by Cisco, global data center traffic is
expected to quadruple over the next
five years, and the fastest-growing

Global data center traffic is
expected to quadruple over the
next five years, and the fastestgrowing component is cloud
data. By 2016, global cloud traffic
will make up nearly two-thirds of
total data center traffic.

component is cloud data. By 2016,
global cloud traffic will make up nearly
two-thirds of total data center traffic.
Piecemeal security solutions, such
as applying firewalls to a changeable
network edge, don’t secure data that
is now constantly in motion among
devices, networks, and clouds. Even
among data centers—which now
house organizations’ “crown jewels”
(big data)—virtualization is becoming
more the rule than the exception.
Addressing security challenges
presented by virtualization and the
cloud requires rethinking security
postures to reflect this new paradigm—
perimeter-based controls and old
models of access and containment
need to be changed to secure the new
business model.

Connected Workers

the any-to-any equation is young,
mobile workers. This group believes
they should be able to do business
wherever they happen to be and on

the changing attitudes that college
students and young professionals
around the globe have toward work,
technology, and security.
The latest study shines even more
light on these workers’ attitudes
toward security, with a special focus
on privacy and how much or how
often a company can intrude on an
employee’s desire to freely roam the
Internet while at work. The 2012 Cisco
Connected World Technology Report
study also examines whether online
privacy is still something that all users
actively worry about.

Data Analysis and
Global Security Trends
The 2013 Cisco Annual Security
Report includes in-depth analysis of
web malware and spam trends, based
on research conducted by Cisco.
While many who operate in the

“We are seeing some disturbing changes in the threat environment
facing governments, companies, and societies.”
John N. Stewart, Senior Vice President and Chief Security Officer at Cisco

“shadow economy” have centered their
efforts in recent years on developing
increasingly sophisticated techniques,
Cisco’s research makes clear that
cybercriminals are often turning to
well-known and basic methods to
compromise users.
The rise in distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attacks over the past
year is just one example of the trend
toward “what’s old is new again” in
cybercrime. For several years, DDoS
attacks—which can paralyze Internet
service providers (ISPs) and disrupt
traffic to and from targeted websites—
have been low on the list of IT security
priorities for many enterprises.
However, recent campaigns against
a number of high-profile companies—
including U.S. financial institutions2
—serve as a reminder that any
cybersecurity threat has the potential
to create significant disruption,
and even irreparable damage, if
an organization is not prepared for
it. Therefore, when creating their
business continuity management
plans, enterprises would be wise to
consider how they would respond to

and recover from a disruptive cyber
event—whether that event takes the
form of a DDoS attack directed at the
company; a critical, Internet-enabled
manufacturing facility suddenly going
offline; an advanced multistage attack
by the criminal underground; or
something else never before seen.
“While the IT security discussion has
suffered more than its fair share
of alarmism over the years, we are
seeing some disturbing changes
in the threat environment facing
governments, companies, and
societies,” says John N. Stewart,
Senior Vice President and Chief
Security Officer at Cisco. “Cybercrime
is no longer an annoyance or another
cost of doing business. We are
approaching a tipping point where
the economic losses generated
by cybercrime are threatening to
overwhelm the economic benefits
created by information technology.
Clearly, we need new thinking and
approaches to reducing the damage
that cybercrime inflicts on the wellbeing of the world.”

Endpoint
Proliferation

13

The “any-to-any” evolution already
involves billions of Internet-connected
devices; in 2012, the number of
these devices globally grew to
more than 9 billion.
3

Considering that less than 1 percent
of things in the physical world are
connected today, there remains
vast potential to “connect the
unconnected.”4 It is projected that
with an Internet that already has
an estimated 50 billion “things”
connected to it, the number of
connections will increase to
13,311,666,640,184,600 by the
year 2020. Adding just one more
Internet-connected “thing” (50 billion
+ 1) will increase the number of
connections by another 50 billion.5
As for the “things” that will eventually
comprise the “everything,” they will
range from smartphones to home
heating systems to wind turbines
to cars. Dave Evans, Cisco’s Chief
Futurist with the Internet Business
Solutions Group, explains the concept
of endpoint proliferation like this:
“When your car becomes connected
to the Internet of Everything in the

near future, it will simply increase the
number of things on the Internet by
one. Now, think about the numerous
other elements to which your car could
be connected—other cars, stoplights,
your home, service personnel, weather
reports, warning signs, and even the
road itself.”6

In the Internet of Everything,
connections are what matter most.
The types of connections, not the
number, are what create value
between people, processes, data, and
things. And eventually, the number
of connections will dwarf the number
of things.7 The explosion of new
connections already becoming part
of the Internet of Everything is driven
primarily by the development of more
and more IP-enabled devices, but also
by the increase in global broadband
availability and the advent of IPv6. The
security risks posed by the Internet of
Everything are not just related to the
any-to-any endpoint proliferation that
is bringing us closer, day by day, to an
even more highly connected world,
but also the opportunity for malicious
actors to utilize even more inroads
to compromise users, networks, and
data. The new connections themselves
create risk because they will generate
even more data in motion that needs
to be protected in real time—including
the ballooning volumes of big data that
enterprises will continue to collect,
store, and analyze.

“The Internet of Everything is
quickly taking shape, so the
security professional needs to
think about how to shift their
focus from simply securing
endpoints and the network
perimeter.”
Chris Young, Senior Vice President of the
Security and Government Group at Cisco

“The Internet of Everything is quickly
taking shape, so the security
professional needs to think about
how to shift their focus from simply
securing endpoints and the network
perimeter,” says Chris Young. “There
will be too many devices, too many
connections, and too many content
types and applications—and the
number will only keep growing. In this
new landscape, the network itself
becomes part of the security paradigm
that allows enterprises to extend
policy and control over different
environments.”

Cisco BYOD Update
Endpoint proliferation is a phenomenon Cisco knows well within its own organization of
70,000 employees worldwide. Since formalizing its bring-your-own-device (BYOD) practice
two years ago, the company has witnessed a 79 percent growth rate in the number of
mobile devices in use in the organization.
The Cisco 2011 Annual Security Report 8 first examined Cisco’s unfolding BYOD journey,
which is part of the organization’s ongoing and broader transition toward becoming a “virtual
enterprise.” By the time Cisco reaches the last stage of its planned journey, which will take
several years, the company will be increasingly location- and service-independent—and
enterprise data still will be secure.9
In 2012, Cisco added about 11,000 smartphones and tablet computers companywide—or
about 1,000 new Internet-enabled devices per month. “At the end of 2012, there were nearly
60,000 smartphones and tablets in use in the organization—including just under 14,000
iPads—and all of them were Bring Your Own (BYO),” says Brett Belding, Senior Manager
overseeing Cisco IT Mobility Services. “Mobile at Cisco is now BYO, period.”
The device type that’s seen the biggest increase in use at Cisco is the Apple iPad.
“It’s fascinating to think that three years ago, this product didn’t even exist,” says Belding.
“Now, there are more than 14,000 iPads being used at Cisco every day by our employees
for a variety of activities—both personal- and work-related. And employees are using
iPads in addition to their smartphones.”
As for smartphones, the number of Apple iPhones in use at Cisco has almost tripled in two
years’ time to nearly 28,600. RIM BlackBerry, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows
devices are also included in the BYOD program at Cisco. Employees make the choice to
trade having access to corporate data on their personal device with agreement on security

“We have more devices supported than ever before and, at the
same time, we’ve had the fewest number of support cases. Our goal
is that someday an employee can simply bring in any device and
self-provision using the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and set
up our core WebEx collaboration tools, including Meeting Center,
Jabber, and WebEx Social.”
Brett Belding, Senior Manager Overseeing Cisco IT Mobility Services

controls. For example, users who want to check their email and calendar on their device
are required to take Cisco’s security profile that enforces remote wipe, encryption and
passphrase.
Social support has been a key component of the BYOD program at Cisco from the start.
“We rely heavily on [the enterprise collaboration platform] WebEx Social as our BYOD support
platform, and it’s paid huge dividends,” says Belding. “We have more devices supported
than ever before and, at the same time, we’ve had the fewest number of support cases.
Our goal is that someday an employee can simply bring in any device and self-provision
using the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and set up our core WebEx collaboration
tools, including Meeting Center, Jabber, and WebEx Social.”
The next step for BYOD at Cisco, according to Belding, is to further improve security by
increasing visibility and control over all user activity and devices, on both the physical
network and virtual infrastructure, while improving the user experience. “Caring about the
user experience is a core consumerization of IT trend,” says Belding. “We’re trying to apply
this concept to our organization. We have to. I think what we’re seeing now is an ‘IT-ization’
of users. We’re beyond the point of them asking, ‘Can I use this device at work?’ Now
they’re saying, ‘I understand you need to keep the enterprise secure, but don’t interfere
with my user experience.’”

Services

Many Clouds

Global data center traffic is on the
rise. According to the Cisco Global
Cloud Index, global data center
traffic is expected to quadruple over
the next five years and will grow
at a compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of 31 percent between
2011 and 2016.
10

Of this tremendous growth, the
fastest-growing component is cloud
data. Global cloud traffic will increase
sixfold over the next five years,
growing at a rate of 44 percent from
2011 to 2016. In fact, global cloud
traffic will make up nearly two-thirds
of total data center traffic by 2016.11
This explosion in cloud traffic
raises questions about the ability of
enterprises to manage this information.
In the cloud, the lines of control are
blurred: Can an organization place
safety nets around its cloud data when
they don’t own and operate the data
center? How can even basic security

tools such as firewalls and antivirus
software be applied when the network
edge cannot be defined?
No matter how many security
questions are raised, it’s clear more
and more enterprises are embracing
the benefits of clouds—and those

that have are not likely to return to a
the private data center model. While
the opportunities of the cloud for
organizations are many—including
cost savings, greater workforce
collaboration, productivity, and a
reduced carbon footprint—the possible
security risks that enterprises face as
a result of moving business data and
processes to the cloud include:

Hypervisors
If compromised, this software that
creates and runs virtual machines
could lead to mass hacking or
data compromise against multiple
servers—applying the same ease
of management and access that
virtualization provides to a successful
hack. A rogue hypervisor (taken
control of by “hyperjacking”) can take
complete control of a server.12

Lowered cost of entry
Virtualization has lowered the cost of
entry to provide services like a virtual
private server (VPS). Compared to
older hardware-based data center
models, we are seeing growth in
quick, cheap, and easily available
infrastructure for criminal activities.
For instance, there are many VPS
services available for instant sale
(with the ability to purchase using
Bitcoin or other hard-to-trace payment
types) that are targeted to the criminal
underground. Virtualization has made
infrastructure much cheaper and
easier to provide—with little to no
policing of activities.

“Decoupling” of virtualized
applications
Because virtualized applications are
decoupled from the physical resources
they use, it becomes more difficult
for enterprises to apply traditional
security approaches. IT providers
seek to minimize cost with a very
elastic offering in which they can move
resources as needed—contrasted with
the security group seeking to collocate
services of like security posture and
keep them apart from others that may
be less secure.

“Virtualization and cloud computing
create problems just like those of
BYOD, but turned on their head,”
says Joe Epstein, former Chief
Executive Officer of Virtuata, a
company acquired by Cisco in 2012
that provides innovative capabilities
for securing virtual machine-level
information in data centers and
cloud environments. “High-value
applications and high-value data are
now moving around the data center.
And the notion of virtual workloads
makes enterprises uncomfortable.
In the virtual environment, how do
you know you can trust what you’re
running? The answer is that you
haven’t been able to so far—and that
uncertainty has been a key barrier to
cloud adoption.”
But Epstein notes that it is becoming
increasingly difficult for enterprises
to ignore virtualization and the
cloud. “The world is going to share
everything,” he says. “Everything
will be virtualized; everything will
be shared. It will not make sense to
continue running only private data
centers; hybrid clouds are where IT
is heading.”

“Virtualization and cloud
computing create problems
just like those of BYOD, but
turned on their head... High-value
applications and high-value
data are now moving around
the data center.”
Joe Epstein, Former Chief Executive
Officer of Virtuata

The answer to these growing cloud
and virtualization challenges is
adaptive and responsive security.
In this case, security must be a
programmable element seamlessly
integrated into the underlying data
center fabric, according to Epstein. In
addition, security needs to be built in
at the design phase, instead of being
bolted on post-implementation.

Blending of
Business and
Personal Use
Millennials and
the Workplace

23

Modern workers—particularly young
“Millennials”—want the freedom to
browse the web not only when and
how they want to, but also with the
devices they choose. However, they
don’t want these freedoms impinged
upon by their employers, a situation
that can spell tension for security
professionals.
According to the 2012 Cisco
Connected World Technology Report
study, two-thirds of respondents
believe employers should not track
employees’ online activities on
company-issued devices. In short,
they do not think employers have any
business monitoring such behavior.
Only about one-third (34 percent) of
workers surveyed say they don’t mind
if employers track their online behavior.
Only one in five respondents say
their employers do track their online
activities on company-owned devices,
while 46 percent say their employers
do not track activity. Findings for the

latest Connected World study also
show that Millennials have strong
feelings about employers tracking the
online activity of workers—even those
who report they work at organizations
where such tracking does not occur.

Only one in five respondents
say their employers do track
their online activities on
company-owned devices,
while 46 percent say their

24

2013 Cisco Annual Security Report

Compounding the challenges for
security professionals, there appears
to be a disconnect between what
employees think they can do with
their company-issued devices and
what policies IT actually dictates
about personal usage. Four out of 10
respondents say they are supposed
to use company-issued devices for
work activity only, while a quarter
say they are allowed to use company
devices for non work activity. However,
90 percent of IT professionals
surveyed say they do indeed have
policies that prohibit company-issued
devices being used for personal
online activity—although 38 percent
acknowledge that employees break
policy and use devices for personal
activities in addition to doing work.
(You can find information about Cisco’s
approach to these BYOD challenges
on page 16.)

There appears to be a
disconnect between what
employees think they can do
with their company-issued
devices and what policies
IT actually dictates about
personal usage.

25

Privacy and Millennials
According to the 2012 Cisco
Connected World Technology Report,
Millennials have accepted the fact that,
thanks to the Internet, personal privacy
may be a thing of the past. Ninety-one
percent of young consumers surveyed
say that the age of privacy is over and
believe they can’t control the privacy
of their information, with one-third of
respondents reporting they are not
worried about the data that is stored
and captured about them.
In general, Millennials also believe
their online identity is different from
their offline identity. Forty-five percent
say these identities are often different
depending on the activity in question,
while 36 percent believe these
identities are completely different.
Only 8 percent believe these identities
are the same.
Young consumers also have high
expectations that websites will keep
their information private, often feeling
more comfortable sharing data with
large social media or community sites
given the cloak of anonymity the crowd
provides. Forty-six percent say they
expect certain websites to keep their

information secure, while 17 percent
say they trust most websites to keep
their information private. However,
29 percent say that not only do
they not trust websites to keep their
information private, they also are very
concerned about security and identity
theft. Compare this to the idea of
sharing data with an employer who
has the context about who they are
and what they do.
“Millennials are now entering the
workplace and bringing with them
new working practices and attitudes
to information and the associated
security thereof. They believe in the
demise of privacy—that it’s simply
defunct in practice, and it’s in this
paradigm that organizations must
operate—a concept that will be
alarming to the older generation in
the workplace,” says Adam Philpott,
Director, EMEAR Security Sales, Cisco.
“Organizations can, however, look to
provide information security education
to their employees to alert them to the
risks and provide guidance on how
best to share information and leverage
online tools within the realms of
data security.”

Why Enterprises Need to Raise Awareness
of Social Media Disinformation
by Jean Gordon Kocienda
Global Threat Analyst, Cisco

Social media has been a boon for many enterprises; the ability to connect directly with
customers and other audiences via Twitter and Facebook has helped many organizations
build brand awareness via online social interaction.
The flip side of this lightning-fast direct communication is that social media can allow
inaccurate or misleading information to spread like wildfire. It isn’t hard to imagine a
scenario in which a terrorist coordinates on-the-ground attacks by using misleading
tweets with the intent to clog roads or phone lines, or to send people into the path of
danger. One example: India’s government blocked hundreds of websites and curbed
texts13 this summer in an attempt to restore calm in north-eastern part of the country
after photographs and text messages were posted. The rumors prompted thousands
of panicked migrant workers to flood train and bus stations.
Similar social media disinformation campaigns have affected market prices as well. A
hijacked Reuters Twitter feed reported that the Free Syrian Army had collapsed in Aleppo.
A few days later, a Twitter feed was compromised, and a purported top Russian diplomat
tweeted that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad was dead. Before these accounts could
be discredited, oil prices on international markets spiked.14
Security professionals need to be alert to such fast-moving and potentially damaging
social media posts, especially if they are directed at the enterprise itself—and quick
action is needed to defend networks from malware, alert employees to a bogus phishing
attempt, re-route a shipment, or advise employees regarding safety. The last thing
security executives want to do is alert managers to a breaking story that turns out to
be a hoax.
The first safeguard against falling for fabricated stories is to confirm the story across
multiple sources. At one time, journalists did this job for us, so that by the time we read
or heard the news, it was vetted. These days, many journalists are getting their stories
from the same Twitter feeds that we are, and if several of us fall for the same story,
we can easily mistake re-tweets for story confirmation.
For fast-breaking news requiring quick action, your best bet may be to use the
old-fashioned “sniff test.” If the story seems far-fetched, think twice before repeating
or citing it.15

Big Data
A Big Deal for
Today’s Enterprises

29

The business world is abuzz about
“big data”—and the potential for
analytics “gold” that can be mined
from the vast volumes of information
that enterprises generate, collect,
and store.
The 2012 Cisco Connected World
Technology Report examined the
impact of the big-data trend on
enterprises—and more specifically,
their IT teams. According to the
study’s findings, about three-quarters
(74 percent) of organizations globally
are already collecting and storing
data, and management is using
analysis of big data to make business
decisions. Additionally, seven in 10
IT respondents reported that big
data will be a strategic priority for
their company and IT team in the
year ahead.
As mobility, cloud, virtualization,
endpoint proliferation, and other
networking trends evolve or emerge,
they will pave the way for even more
big data and analytics opportunities

for businesses. But there are security
concerns about big data. The 2012
Connected World study’s findings
show that a third of respondents
(32 percent) believe big data
complicates security requirements
and protection of data and networks
because there is so much data and too
many ways of accessing it. In short,
big data increases the vectors and
angles that enterprise security teams—
and security solutions—must cover.

of Threat Research for Cisco Security

doesn’t complicate security—it makes it
possible. At Cisco we collect and store
2.6 trillion records every day—that
forms the platform from which we can
start incident detection and control.”
As for solutions designed to help
enterprises both better manage and
unlock the value of their big data, there
are barriers to adoption. Respondents
pointed to lack of budget, lack of time
to study big data, lack of appropriate

solutions, lack of IT staff, and lack
of IT expertise. The fact that almost
one in four respondents globally
(23 percent) said lack of expertise
and personnel was an inhibitor to their
enterprise’s ability to use big data
effectively indicates a need for more
professionals entering the job market
to be trained in this area.
The cloud is a factor in big data
success, as well, according to 50
percent of IT respondents to the 2012
Connected World study. They believe
their organizations need to work

More than half of overall IT

is not surprising considering the
market is just now trying to understand
how to harness their big data,
analyze it, and use it strategically.
In some countries, however, big-data
discussions are resulting in meaningful

Danger Lurks in
Surprising Places

Many security professionals—and
certainly a large community of
online users—hold preconceived
ideas about where people are most
likely to stumble across dangerous
web malware.
The general belief is that sites that
promote criminal activity—such as
sites selling illegal pharmaceuticals
or counterfeit luxury goods—are most
likely to host malware. Our data reveals
the truth of this outdated notion, as
web malware encounters are typically
not the by-product of “bad” sites in
today’s threat landscape.
“Web malware encounters occur
everywhere people visit on the
Internet—including the most legitimate
of websites that they visit frequently,
even for business purposes,” says
Mary Landesman, Senior Security
Researcher with Cisco. “Indeed,
business and industry sites are one
of the top three categories visited
when a malware encounter occurred.
Of course, this isn’t the result of
business sites that are designed to
be malicious.” The dangers, however,

are often hidden in plain sight through
exploit-laden online ads that are
distributed to legitimate websites, or
hackers targeting the user community
on the common sites they use most.
In addition, malware-infected
websites are prevalent across many
countries and regions—not just in
one or two countries, dispelling the
notion that some countries’ websites
are more likely to host malicious
content than others. “The web is the
most formidable malware delivery
mechanism we’ve seen to date,
outpacing even the most prolific

“Enterprises need protection, even if
they block common ‘bad’ sites, with
additional granularity in inspection
and analysis.”

Malware Encounters
by Company Size
The largest enterprises (25,000+
employees) have more than 2.5
times the risk of encountering web
malware than smaller companies.
This increased risk may be a reflection
that larger companies possess more
high-value intellectual property and
thus are more frequently targeted.
While smaller companies have fewer
web malware encounters per user, it’s
important to note that all companies—
regardless of size—face significant
risk of web malware encounters.
Every organization should focus on
the fundamentals of securing its
network and intellectual property.

Malware Encounters
by Country
Cisco’s research shows significant
change in the global landscape for
web malware encounters by country
in 2012. China, which was second
on the list in 2011 for web malware

encounters, fell dramatically to
sixth position in 2012. Denmark and
Sweden now hold the third and fourth
spots, respectively. The United States
retains the top ranking in 2012, as it
did in 2011, with 33 percent of all web
malware encounters occurring via
websites hosted in the United States.
Changes in geographical location
between 2011 and 2012 likely reflect
both changes in detection and user
habits. For example, “malvertising,”
or malware delivered via online ads,
played a more significant role in
web malware encounters in 2012
than in 2011. It is worth repeating
that web malware encounters most
frequently occur via normal browsing
of legitimate websites that may have
been compromised or are unwittingly
serving malicious advertising.
Malicious advertising can impact any
website, regardless of the site’s origin.
Overall, the geographical data for
2012 demonstrates that the web is an
equal-opportunity infector—contrary to
the perceptions that only one or two
countries are responsible for hosting
web malware or that any one country
is safer than another. Just as the
dynamic content delivery of Web 2.0
enables the monetization of websites
across the globe, it can also facilitate
the global delivery of web malware.

Of course, there is a distinct
difference between where a web
malware encounter occurs and
where the malware is actually hosted.
In malvertising, for example, the
encounter typically occurs when
visiting a reputable, legitimate website
that happens to carry third-party
advertising. However, the actual
malware intended for delivery is
hosted on a completely different
domain. Since Cisco’s data is based on
where the encounter occurred, it has
no bearing on actual malware origin.
For instance, increased popularity of
social media and entertainment sites
in Denmark and Sweden, coupled with
malvertising risks, is largely responsible
for increased encounters from sites
hosted in those regions but is not
indicative of actual malware origin.

Android Growth

Android Growth: 2577%
JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC

Android malware grew substantially
faster than any other form of webdelivered malware, an important trend
given that Android is reported to hold
the majority of mobile device market
share worldwide. It is important to
note that mobile malware encounters
comprised only 0.5 percent of all web
malware encounters in 2012, with
Android taking over 95 percent of all
these web malware encounters. In
addition, 2012 saw the emergence of

the first documented Android botnet
in the wild, indicating that mobile
malware developments in 2013
bear watching.
While some experts are claiming
Android is the “biggest threat”
or should be a primary focus for
enterprise security teams in 2013—
the actual data shows otherwise. As
noted above, mobile web malware
in general makes up less than 1
percent of total encounters—far from
the “doomsday” scenario many are
detailing. The impact of BYOD and
the proliferation of devices cannot
be overstated, but organizations
should be more concerned with
threats such as accidental data loss,
ensuring employees do not “root”
or “jailbreak” their devices, and only
install applications from official and
trusted distribution channels. If users
choose to go outside official mobile
app stores, they should ensure, before
downloading an app, that they know
and trust the app’s author and can
validate that the code has not been
tampered with.
Looking at the wider landscape for
web malware, it is not surprising that
malicious scripts and iFrames
comprised 83 percent of encounters
in 2012. While this is relatively
consistent with previous years,
it’s a finding worthy of reflection.

40

2013 Cisco Annual Security Report

These types of attacks often represent
malicious code on “trusted” webpages
that users may visit every day—
meaning an attacker is able to
compromise users without even
raising their suspicion.
Exploits take the second spot, with
10 percent of the total number of
web malware encounters last year.
However, these figures are largely a
result of where the block occurred
versus actual concentration of exploits
on the web. For example, the 83
percent of malicious scripts and
hidden iFrames are blocks that occur
at an earlier stage, prior to any exploit
rendering; hence, they may artificially
decrease the number of exploits
observed.
Exploits remain a significant cause
of infection via the web, and their
continued presence underscores the
need for vendors to adopt security
best practices in their product life
cycles. Organizations should focus on
security as part of the product design
and development process, with timely
vulnerability disclosures, and prompt/
regular patch cycles. Organizations
and users also need to be made aware
of the security risks associated with
using products that are no longer
supported by vendors. It is also critical
for organizations to maintain a core

41

vulnerability management process and
for users to keep to their hardware and
software up to date.
Rounding out the top five are
infostealers, with 3.5 percent of the
total web malware encounters in
2012, downloaders (1.1 percent), and
worms (0.8 percent). Once again,
these numbers are a reflection of
where the block occurs, generally
at the point in which the malicious
script or iFrame is first encountered.
As a result, these numbers are not
reflective of the actual number of
infostealers, downloaders, or worms
being distributed via the web.

Top Malware
Content Types
Malware creators constantly seek to
maximize their return on investment
(ROI) by finding ways to reach the
largest population of potential victims
with the least effort, and they often
take advantage of cross-platform
technologies when possible. Toward
these ends, exploit toolkits generally
deliver exploits in a specific order;
once a successful exploit has been
delivered, no further exploits are
attempted. The high concentration
of Java exploits—87 percent of total
web exploits—shows that these
vulnerabilities are attempted prior
to other types of exploits and also

In examining media content, Cisco
data reveals almost twice as much
image-based malware than non-Flash
video. However, this is due, in part,
to the way browsers handle declared
content types, and attackers’ efforts
to manipulate these controls by
declaring erroneous content types.
In addition, malware command-andcontrol systems often distribute server
information via comments hidden in
ordinary image files.

Top Site Category
As Cisco data shows, the notion
that malware infections most
commonly result from “risky” sites
such as counterfeit software is a
misconception. Cisco’s analysis
indicates that the vast majority of web
malware encounters actually occur
via legitimate browsing of mainstream
websites. In other words, the majority
of encounters happen in the places
that online users visit the most—and
think are safe.
Holding the second spot on the list
are online advertisements, comprising
16 percent of total web malware
encounters. Syndicated advertising
is a common means of monetizing
websites, so a single malicious ad
distributed in this manner can have a
dramatic, adverse impact.

When Gothic Horror Gives Birth to Malware
by Kevin W. Hamlen
Associate Professor, Computer Science Department, The University of Texas at Dallas

Malware camouflage is an emerging threat that security professionals may increasingly face.
While most malware already uses simple mutation or obfuscation to diversify and make itself
harder to reverse-engineer, self-camouflaging malware is even stealthier, blending in with
the specific software already present on each system it infects. This can elude defenses that
look for software anomalies like runtime unpacking or encrypted code, which often expose
more conventional malware.
The latest self-camouflaging malware technology—appropriately dubbed Frankenstein17—is
a product of our research this year in the Cyber Security Research and Education Center
at The University of Texas at Dallas. Like the fictional mad scientist in Mary Shelley’s 1818
horror novel, “Frankenstein malware” creates mutants by stealing body parts (i.e., code)
from other software it encounters and stitches the code together to create unique variants of
itself. Each Frankenstein mutant is therefore composed entirely of non-anomalous, benignlooking software; performs no suspicious runtime unpacking or encryption; and has access
to an ever-expanding pool of code transformations learned from the many programs it
encounters.
Under the hood, Frankenstein brings its creations to life using an array of techniques drawn
from compiler theory and program analysis. Victim binaries are first scanned for short byte
sequences that decode to potentially useful instruction sequences, called gadgets. A small
abstract interpreter next infers the possible semantic effects of each gadget discovered.
Backtracking search is then applied to discover gadget sequences that, when executed in
order, have the effect of implementing the malware payload’s malicious behavior.

In general, our research suggests that next-generation malware
may increasingly eschew simple mutations based on encryption and
packing in favor of advanced metamorphic binary obfuscations like
those used by Frankenstein.

Each such discovered sequence is finally assembled to form a fresh mutant. In practice,
Frankenstein discovers over 2,000 gadgets per second, accumulating over 100,000 from
just two or three victim binaries in under five seconds. With such a large gadget pool at
their disposal, the resulting mutants rarely share any common instruction sequences; each
therefore looks unique.
In general, our research suggests that next-generation malware may increasingly eschew
simple mutations based on encryption and packing in favor of advanced metamorphic
binary obfuscations like those used by Frankenstein. Such obfuscations are feasible to
implement, support rapid propagation, and are effective for concealing malware from the
static analysis phases of most malware detection engines. To counter this trend, defenders
will need to deploy some of the same technologies used to develop Frankenstein, including
static analyses based on semantic, rather than syntactic, feature extraction, and semantic
signatures derived from machine learning18 rather than purely manual analysis.

Evolutionary
Threats
New Methods,
Same Exploits

51

Anything goes when it comes
to cyber exploits today—as long
as the method selected will
get the job done.
This is not to say that actors in the
shadow economy do not remain
committed to creating ever-more
sophisticated tools and techniques to
compromise users, infect networks,
and steal sensitive data, among many
other goals. In 2012, however, there
was a trend toward reaching back
to “oldies but goodies” to find new
ways to create disruption or evade
enterprise security protections.
DDoS attacks are a primary example—
several major U.S. financial institutions
were the high-profile targets of two
major and related campaigns launched
by foreign hacktivist groups in the
last six months of 2012 (for detailed
analysis, see the 2012 Distributed
Denial of Service Trends section).
Some security experts warn that these
events are just the beginning and that
“hacktivists, organized crime rings,

and even nation states will be the
perpetrators”19 of these attacks in the
future, working both collaboratively
and independently.
“We are seeing a trend in DDoS, with
attackers adding additional context
about their target site to make the
outage more significant,” says
Gavin Reid, Director of Threat
Research for Cisco Security
Intelligence Operations, “Instead of
doing a SYN flood, the DDoS now
attempts to manipulate a specific
application in the organization—
potentially causing a cascading set
of damage if it fails.”

“Even against a sophisticated—but
average—adversary, the current
‘state of the art’ in network
security is often significantly
outmatched.”
Gregory Neal Akers, Senior Vice President
for the Advanced Security Initiatives Group
at Cisco

While enterprises may believe they
are adequately protected against the
DDoS threat, more than likely their
network could not defend against the
type of high-volume and relentless
DDoS attacks witnessed in 2012.
“Even against a sophisticated—but
average—adversary, the current ‘state
of the art’ in network security is
often significantly outmatched,” says
Gregory Neal Akers, Senior Vice
President for the Advanced Security
Initiatives Group at Cisco.

53

Another trend in the cybercrime
community revolves around the
“democratization” of threats. We are
increasingly seeing that the tools
and techniques—and intelligence
about how to exploit vulnerabilities—
are being “broadly shared” in the
shadow economy today. “Tradecraft
capabilities have evolved a great deal,”
Akers says. “We’re now seeing more
specialization and more collaboration
among malicious actors. It’s a threat
assembly line: Someone develops a
bug, someone else writes the malware,
another person designs the social
engineering component, and so on.”

Amplification and Reflection Attacks

Creating potent threats that will
help them gain access to the large
volumes of high-value assets coming
across the network is one reason that
cybercriminals are combining their
expertise more often. But like any realworld organization that outsources
tasks, efficiency and cost savings
are among the primary drivers for
the “build-a-threat” approach in the
cybercrime community. The “freelance
talent” hired for these tasks typically
advertise their skills and pay rates to
the broader cybercrime community via
secret online marketplaces.

Attack Sizes Continue to Trend Upward
Overall, there has been an increase in the average size of attacks over the past year. There
was a 27 percent increase in throughput of attacks (1.23 Gbps in 2011 to 1.57 Gbps in 2012)
and a 15 percent increase in the packets per second used in attacks (1.33 Mpps in 2011 to
1.54 Mpps in 2012).

DNS amplification and reflection attacks20 utilize domain name system (DNS) open recursive
resolvers or DNS authoritative servers to increase the volume of attack traffic sent to a
victim. By spoofing21 DNS request messages, these attacks conceal the true source of
the attack and send DNS queries that return DNS response messages 1000 to 10,000
percent larger than the DNS request message. These types of attack profiles are commonly
observed during DDoS22 attacks.
Organizations are inadvertently participating in these attacks by leaving open recursive
resolvers out on the Internet. They can detect the attacks using various tools23 and flow
telemetry24 technologies and can help prevent them by securing25 their DNS server or
rate-limiting26 DNS response messages.

2012 Distributed Denial of Service Trends
The following analysis is derived from the Arbor Networks ATLAS repository, which consists
of global data gathered from a number of sources, from 240 ISPs, monitoring peak traffic of
37.8 Tbps.27

Attack Demographics
The top three monitored attack sources, after removing 41 percent of sources for which
there is no attribution due to data anonymization, are China (17.8 percent), South Korea
(12.7 percent), and the United States (8.0 percent).
Largest Attacks
The largest monitored attack was measured at 100.84 Gbps and lasted approximately 20
minutes (source of attack is unknown due to data anonymization). The corresponding largest
monitored attack in (pps) was measured at 82.36 Mpps and lasted approximately 24 minutes
(source of attack is unknown due to data anonymization).

CASE STUDY

Operation Ababil
During September and October 2012, Cisco and Arbor Networks monitored a targeted
and very serious DDoS attack campaign known as “Operation Ababil,” which was aimed
at U.S.-based financial institutions.” The DDoS attacks were premeditated, focused,
advertised before the fact, and executed to the letter. Attackers were able to render several
major financial sites unavailable to legitimate customers for a period of minutes—and in
the most severe instances, hours. Over the course of the events, several groups claimed
responsibility for the attacks; at least one group purported to be protesting copyright and
intellectual property legislation in the United States. Others broadcast their involvement as
a response to a YouTube video offensive to some Muslims.

sent to TCP/UDP port 53 (DNS) or 80 (HTTP). While traffic on UDP port 53 and TCP port
53 and 80 represent normally valid traffic, packets destined for UDP port 80 represent an
anomaly not commonly used by applications.

From a cybersecurity standpoint, Operation Ababil is notable because it took advantage of
common web applications and hosting servers that are as popular as they are vulnerable.
The other obvious and uncommon factor used in this series of attacks was that simultaneous
attacks, at high bandwidth, were launched against multiple companies in the same industry
(financial).

While they are a critical part of any network security portfolio, IPS and firewall devices rely
on stateful traffic inspection. Application-layer techniques used in the Operation Ababil
campaign easily overwhelmed those state tables and, in several cases, caused them to
fail. Intelligent DDoS mitigation technology was the only effective countermeasure.

As is often seen in the security industry, what’s old is new again.
On September 18, 2012, “Cyber Fighters of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam” posted on Pastebin29
beseeching Muslims to target major financial institutions and commodities trading platforms.
The threats and specific targets were put up for the world to see and continued for four
consecutive weeks. Each week, new threats with new targets were followed up by actions
at the appointed times and dates. By the fifth week, the group stopped naming targets
but made it clear that campaigns would continue. As promised, the campaigns renewed in
earnest in December 2012, once again targeting multiple large U.S. financial organizations.
Phase 2 of Operation Ababil was also announced on Pastebin.30 Instead of infected
machines, a variety of PHP web applications, including the Joomla Content Management
System, served as the primary bots in the campaign. Additionally, many WordPress sites,
often using the out-of-date TimThumb plug-in, were being compromised around the same
time. The attackers often went after unmaintained servers hosting these applications and
uploaded PHP webshells to deploy further attack tools. The concept of “command and
control” did not apply in the usual manner, however; the attackers connected to the tools
directly or through intermediate servers, scripts, and proxies. During the cyber events in
September and October 2012, a wide array of files and PHP-based tools were used, not just
the widely reported “tsoknoproblembro” (aka “Brobot”). The second round of activity also
utilized updated attack tools such as Brobot v2.
Operation Ababil deployed a combination of tools with vectors crossing application-layer
attacks on HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS with volumetric attack traffic on a variety of TCP, UDP,
ICMP, and other IP protocols. Cisco’s analysis showed that the majority of packets were

A detailed report of the patterns and payloads of the Operation Ababil campaign can
be found in Cisco Event Response: Distributed Denial of Service Attacks on Financial
Institutions.31

Lessons Learned

Managed security services and ISPs have their limits. In a typical DDoS attack, the prevailing
wisdom says to deal with volumetric attacks in the network. For application-layer campaigns
that are deployed closer to the victim, these should be addressed at the data center or on
the “customer edge.” Because multiple organizations were targeted concurrently, network
scrubbing centers were strained.
It is critical to keep hardware and software current on DDoS mitigation appliances. Older
deployments are not always able to deal with newer threats. It is also important to have the
right capacity in the right locations. Being able to mitigate a large attack is useless if traffic
cannot be channeled to the location where the technology has been deployed.
While cloud or network DDoS mitigation typically has much higher bandwidth capacity,
on-premise solutions provide better reaction time against, control of, and visibility into the
attacks. Combining the two makes for a more complete solution.
In conjunction with cloud and network DDoS technologies, and as part of the collateral
produced for the Operation Ababil events, Cisco has outlined detection and mitigation
techniques in the Identifying and Mitigating the Distributed Denial of Service Attacks
Targeting Financial Institutions Applied Mitigation Bulletin.32 These techniques include
the use of Transit Access Control List (tACL) filtering, NetFlow data analysis, and unicast
Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF). In addition, there are a number of best practices that
should be regularly reviewed, tested, and implemented that will greatly help enterprises
to prepare for and react to network events. A library of these best practices can be found
by referencing the Cisco SIO Tactical Resources33 and Service Provider Security Best
Practices.34

Spam the
Ever Present

59

Spam volumes are continuing to
decline worldwide, according to
Cisco’s research, but spam remains
a go-to tool for many cybercriminals,
who view it as an efficient and
expedient way to expose users to
malware and facilitate a wide range
of scams.
However, despite the perception
that malware is typically deployed
through spam email attachments,
Cisco’s research shows that very few
spammers today rely on this method;
instead, they turn to malicious links
within the email as a far more efficient
distribution mechanism.
Spam is also less “scattershot” than
in the past, with many spammers
preferring to target specific groups
of users with the hope of generating
higher returns. Name-brand
pharmaceuticals, luxury watch brands,
and events such as tax season top the
list of things that spammers promote
most in their campaigns. Over time,
spammers have learned that the

quickest way to attract clicks and
purchases—and to generate a profit—is
to leverage spoofed brands and take
advantage of current events that have
the attention of large groups of users.

Global Spam Trends
Since the large-scale botnet
takedowns of 2010, high-volume
spam isn’t as effective as it once
was, and spammers have learned
and changed their tactics. There is a
clear evolution toward smaller, more
targeted campaigns based on world
events and particular subsets of users.
High-volume spam is also more likely
to be noticed by mail providers and
shut down before its purpose can
be fulfilled.

CISCO ASR / JAN 28, 2013 200 pm

In 2012, there were several
examples of spammers using
news about world events—and
even human tragedy—to take
advantage of users.

In 2011, overall global spam volumes
were down 18 percent. This is far from
the dramatic drop in volume seen in
2010 following the botnet takedowns,
but the continued downward trend is a
positive development nonetheless.
Spammers continue their focus on
minimizing effort while maximizing
impact. According to Cisco’s research,
spam volumes fall by 25 percent on
weekends, when users are often away
from their email. Spam volumes rise
to the highest levels on Tuesday and
Wednesday—an average of 10 percent
higher than on other weekdays. This
heightened activity in the middle of
the week and lower volumes on the
weekend allow spammers to live
“normal lives.”
It also gives them time to spend
crafting tailored campaigns based on
world events early in the week that
will help them to generate a higher
response rate to their campaigns.

In 2012, there were several examples
of spammers using news about world
events—and even human tragedy—to
take advantage of users. During
Superstorm Sandy, for example, Cisco
researchers identified a massive
“pump and dump” stock scam based
around a spam campaign. Using
a pre-existing email message that
urged people to invest in a penny
stock focused on natural resource
exploration, the spammers began
attaching sensational headlines about
Superstorm Sandy. An unusual aspect
of this campaign is that the spammers
utilized unique IP addresses to send a
batch of spam—and have not activated
those addresses since.

Spam Origination
In the world of spam, some countries
remain the same while others
dramatically change their rankings. In
2012, India retains the top spot as a
source of spam worldwide, with the
United States moving up from sixth in
2011 to second in 2012. Rounding out
the top five spam-originating countries
are Korea (third), China (fourth) and
Vietnam (fifth).
Overall, the majority of spammers
focus their efforts on creating spam
messages that feature the languages

According to Cisco’s research, the

languages that are being used in

while India was the number one

sent from India. The same was true
for Korea, Vietnam, and China.

Spam has long been thought of as
a delivery mechanism for malware,
especially when an attachment is
involved. But Cisco’s recent research
on the use of email attachments in
spam campaigns shows that this
perception may be a myth.
Only 3 percent of total spam has an
attachment, versus 25 percent of
valid email. And in the rare cases
when a spam message does include
an attachment, it is an average of
18 percent larger than a typical
attachment that would be included
in valid email. As a result, these
attachments tend to stand out.

In modern email, links are king.
Spammers design their campaigns
to convince users to visit websites
where they can purchase products
or services (often dubious). Once
there, users’ personal information
is collected, often without their
knowledge, or they are compromised
in some other way.

As the “Spoofed Brands” analysis that
appears later in this section reveals, a
majority of spam comes from groups
who seek to sell a very specific group
of name-brand goods—from luxury
watches to pharmaceuticals—that are,
in most cases, fake.

IPv6 Spam
While IPv6-based email remains a very
small percentage of overall traffic, it is
growing as more email users move to
IPv6-enabled infrastructure.
However, while overall email
volumes are growing at a rapid
clip, this is not the case with IPv6
spam. This suggests that spammers
are hedging against the time and
expense to migrate to the new
Internet standard. There is no driving
need for spammers—and little to no
material benefit—to cause such a shift
at present. As IPv4 addresses are
exhausted and mobile devices and
M2M communication drive explosive
growth in IPv6, expect spammers
to upgrade their infrastructure and
accelerate their efforts.

With spoofed-brands spam email,
spammers use organizations and

spoofed brands are prescription drugs,
such as anti-anxiety medication and
painkillers. In addition, luxury watch
brands form a constant layer of “noise”
that retains consistency across the
entire year.
Cisco’s analysis shows that spammers
are also skilled at tying their
campaigns to news events. From
January to March 2012, Cisco data
shows a spike in spam relating to
Windows software, which coincided
with the release of the Windows 8
operating system. From February to

in tax software spam.

From January to March 2012, and then
again from September to December

perhaps because spammers know
that people often begin job searches
during these times of the year.

The bottom line is spammers
are in it for the money, and over
the years, they have learned that
the quickest way to attract clicks
and purchases is by offering
pharmaceuticals and luxury
goods and by tailoring their
attacks toward events to which
much of the world is paying

Vulnerability Management: A Vendor Has to Do More
Than Enumerate Ambivalently35
How a vendor discloses its product security issues is the most visible aspect of their
vulnerability management practices. At Cisco, Security Advisories36 are researched and
published by the Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT), a group of senior
security experts who understand that protection of Cisco customers and of the corporation
must go hand in hand.
“Security Advisories announce our most severe product security issues and are generally the
first public evidence of a Cisco product vulnerability,” says Russell Smoak, Senior Director
of Cisco Security Research and Operations, “As such, it’s critical that they be an effective
communications vehicle that helps customers make informed decisions and manage their
risk. Combined with the advanced mitigation techniques37 we provide for our customers to
leverage the capabilities in their existing Cisco gear, we are able to provide as many details
as possible to respond quickly and confidently.”
Vulnerability management, however, starts much earlier in the lifecycle of a vulnerability and
can extend beyond initial disclosure. “Continuous improvement in vulnerability management
practices is imperative to keeping pace with the changing security environment as a result of
evolving threats as well as new products and technologies,” says Smoak.
In other words, a vendor that fails to evolve with threat technologies—and that does not
disclose threats—risks falling behind. For example, innovation of internal vulnerabilities
management tools at Cisco has taken place in the area of bundled third-party software.
Third-party software is any code included in a vendor’s product that was not written by the
vendor itself; this typically includes commercial third-party or open-source software.
Cisco takes advantage of custom-built tooling that uses vulnerability data from Cisco
IntelliShield38 to notify the product development teams when a security issue that originates
in third-party software may impact a Cisco product. This tool, called the Cisco Internal
Alert Manager, has greatly increased the ability to manage security issues that originate
in non-Cisco code.

A vendor that fails to evolve with threat technologies—and that does
not disclose threats—risks falling behind.

Improvement of security disclosure practices should be ongoing as well. In early 2013,
Cisco will begin using a new document type—the Cisco Security Notices—to disclose lowto-medium-severity product security issues. Cisco Security Notice will improve the efficacy
of communication around security issues not deemed severe enough to warrant a Cisco
Security Advisory. These documents will be available publicly and indexed by a Common
Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) identifier to improve visibility.
To further enhance how to best digest the ongoing reporting of security issues, vendors
(including Cisco) have begun to include the Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework
(CVRF)39 and Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)40 formats in their disclosures.
These emerging standards help end users evaluate vulnerabilities across multiple platforms
and technologies with confidence—and the standards are able to scale due to the benefits
of machine-readable format. Smoak says, “Ensuring that our customers have the tools that
they need to properly evaluate threats to their networks helps reduce risk and allows them to
prioritize tasks required to secure their infrastructures.”

Security
Outlook 2013

The threat landscape of today is not
a problem caused by uneducated
users visiting malicious sites or is
it solved by blocking known “bad”
locations on the web.
This report has demonstrated how
attackers have become increasingly
more sophisticated, going after the
sites, tools, and applications that
are least likely to be suspected, and
users visit most frequently. Modern
threats are capable of infecting mass
audiences silently and effectively, not
discriminating by industry, business,
size or country. Cybercriminals
are taking advantage of the rapidly
expanding attack surface found in
today’s “any-to-any” world, where
individuals are using any device to
access their business network.
As critical national infrastructure,
businesses, and global financial
markets continue their move to
cloud-based services and mobile
connectivity, an integrated, layered
approach to security is needed to
protect the burgeoning Internet
of Everything. “Hackers and

cybercriminals take advantage of the
fact that every private or public sector
enterprise has its own IT security
program,” says John Stewart. “Yes, we
go to conferences and stay in touch
with each other, but we really need to
move from individualized IT security
to one based on real-time intelligence
sharing and collective response.”
Building a better security infrastructure
doesn’t mean creating a more
complex architecture—in fact, quite
the opposite. It’s about making the
infrastructure and the elements within

it work together, with more intelligence
to detect and mitigate threats. With
the rapid adoption of BYOD, the reality
of multiple devices per user, and
growth of cloud-based services, the
era of managing security capabilities
on each endpoint is over. “We must
take a holistic approach to security
that ensures we are monitoring threats
across all vectors, from email to web
to users themselves,” says Michael
Covington, Product Manager for Cisco
SIO. “Threat intelligence needs to be
elevated above individual platforms in
order to gain a network perspective.”
As threats increasingly target users
and organizations across multiple
vectors, businesses need to collect,
store, and process all securityrelevant network activity to better
understand the scope and extent
of attacks. This level of analysis can
then be augmented with the context
of network activity to make accurate

The network of tomorrow is
an intelligent one that must
provide better security through
a collaborative framework than
previously possible through the

and timely security decisions. As
attackers become more sophisticated,
enterprises must design security
capabilities into the network from the
beginning, with solutions that bring
together threat intelligence, security
policy, and enforceable controls across
all touch points on the network.
As the attackers become more
sophisticated so, too, must the tools
used to thwart their efforts. With the
network providing a common fabric
for communication across platforms,
it will also serve as a means to protect
the devices, services, and users that
routinely use it to exchange sensitive
content. The network of tomorrow is
an intelligent one that must provide
better security through a collaborative
framework than previously possible
through the sum of its individual
components.

It has become an increasing
challenge to manage and secure
today’s distributed and agile
networks.
Online criminals continue to exploit
users’ trust in consumer applications
and devices, increasing the risk
to organizations and employees.
Traditional security, which relies on
the layering of products and the use
of multiple filters, is not enough to
defend against the latest generation
of malware, which spreads quickly,
has global targets, and uses multiple
vectors to propagate.
Cisco stays ahead of the latest threats
using real-time threat intelligence from
Cisco Security Intelligence Operations
(SIO). Cisco SIO is the world’s largest
cloud-based security ecosystem, in
which more than 75 terabits of live
data feeds from deployed Cisco email,
web, firewall, and IPS solutions are
analyzed each day.

Cisco SIO aggregates data from
across threat vectors and analyzes
it using both automated algorithms
and manual processing in an effort to
understand how the threats propagate.
SIO then categorizes threats and
creates rules using more than 200
parameters. Security researchers also
analyze information about security
events that have the potential for
widespread impact on networks,
applications, and devices. Rules are
dynamically delivered to deployed
Cisco security devices every three
to five minutes.

collects data from a worldwide
deployment of sensors that perform
functions such as trapping spam and
crawling the web to actively seek out
new instances of malware.

malicious activities on the Internet.
No security vendor has total visibility
