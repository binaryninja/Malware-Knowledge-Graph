For a month leading up to today's historic meet between North and South Korea's
presidents, a North Korean hacking group has amplified operations and has targeted a wide
variety of business sectors in at least 17 countries.
The purpose of this campaign was to infect organizations, perform reconnaissance, and
steal sensitive data. Targeted industries included critical infrastructure, entertainment,
finance, healthcare, and telecommunications.
This overly aggressive campaign appears to be a new operation carried out by a group of
hackers primarily known as Lazarus Group, the ones responsible for the infamous Sony
Studios hack in 2014. Other names for this group are Hidden Cobra, the name US
authorities are using to describe it, but also the Hastati Group, Group 77, or Labyrinth
Chollima.
The group operates in bursts of hacking activity aimed at specific targets. Past operations
include Operation Troy, Blockbuster, or Dark Seoul.

Operation GhostSecret started last month

The most recent Lazarus Group operation is codenamed Operation GhostSecret and
appears to have started in mid-March 2018 with attacks targeting the Turkish financial
sector.
Cybersecurity firm McAfee describes this particular campaign as sophisticated due to the
"significant capabilities, demonstrated by their tools development and the pace at which [the
attackers] operate."
Researchers identified malware with shared capabilities to hacking tools used in the 2014
Sony hack, but they also found newer tools such as Bankshot (implant), Proxysvc
(downloader), and Escad (backdoor).

Attacks amplify in scale following public disclosure
Experts noted that despite exposing the first attacks on the Turkish financial sector, the
group continued its attacks unphased by the attention their tools and hacking infrastructure
were getting.
Furthermore, attacks seem to have ramped up, most likely in an attempt to use hacking
tools while they were still effective and before security software would be able to detect
them.
McAfee said it alerted the Thai government that some of the command and control servers
used for Operation GhostSecret were hosted on the compromised servers of Thammasat
University in Bangkok. ThaiCERT seized and shut down the servers two days ago.
A full and detailed report on Operation GhostSecret, including IoCs, is available here.

War by other means? Perhaps, NK figures it can accomplish its goals more effectively
via cyber. If they have effective assets in place now (with the constraints and
sanctions), how much more effective would they be with more money and access?
Maybe Kim thinks the Democrats are right about the Russians using cyber to sway
the U.S. 2016 elections; and he can do even better with next elections in SK, Japan....
Don't think he has to worry about the next election in NK.
With their nuclear program, it will take time even to establish the framework of an
agreement; then more time to implement - and if they eventually close all their
facilities; will all their nukes go to China and Russia, as Syria's chemical weapons did
to Russia?
Suppose they do shed their nukes; they still have enough conventional artillery to
flatten the SK capital; it would just take minutes, rather than seconds. A treaty, would
void the UN use-of-force resolution from 1950 - and good luck getting another one
past Russia and China.
Still, today's breakthrough is a reason for optimism; just as long as it's tempered with
skepticism - and for heaven's sake: don't send John (let's make a deal), Kerry to
negotiate!

Indeed since it is know that only 30 computes exist on NK and they are in control of
the government, so obviously it is the government, why are we playing stupid? :)
