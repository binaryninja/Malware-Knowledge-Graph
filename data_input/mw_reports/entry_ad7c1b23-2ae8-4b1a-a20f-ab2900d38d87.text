Nuclear Bot Author Arrested in Sextortion Case
krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/nuclear-bot-author-arrested-in-sextortion-case/

Last summer, a wave of sextortion emails began flooding inboxes around the world. The
spammers behind this scheme claimed they’d hacked your computer and recorded videos of
you watching porn, and promised to release the embarrassing footage to all your contacts
unless a bitcoin demand was paid. Now, French authorities say they’ve charged two men
they believe are responsible for masterminding this scam. One of them is a 21-year-old
hacker interviewed by KrebsOnSecurity in 2017 who openly admitted to authoring a banking
trojan called “Nuclear Bot.”

On Dec. 15, the French news daily Le Parisien published a report stating that French
authorities had arrested and charged two men in the sextortion scheme. The story doesn’t
name either individual, but rather refers to one of the accused only by the pseudonym
“Antoine I.,” noting that his first had been changed (presumably to protect his identity
because he hasn’t yet been convicted of a crime).
“According to sources close to the investigation, Antoine I. surrendered to the French
authorities at the beginning of the month, after being hunted down all over Europe,” the story
notes. “The young Frenchman, who lived between Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic countries,
was indicted on 6 December for ‘extortion by organized gang, fraudulent access to a data
processing system and money laundering.’ He was placed in pre-trial detention.”
According to Le Parisien, Antoine I. admitted to being the inventor of the initial 2018
sextortion scam, which was subsequently imitated by countless other ne’er-do-wells. The
story says the two men deployed malware to compromise at least 2,000 computers that were
used to blast out the sextortion emails.
While that story is light on details about the identities of the accused, an earlier version of it
published Dec. 14 includes more helpful clues. The Dec. 14 piece said Antoine I. had been
interviewed by KrebsOnSecurity in April 2017, where he boasted about having created
Nuclear Bot, a malware strain designed to steal banking credentials from victims.
My April 2017 exposé featured an interview with Augustin Inzirillo, a young man who came
across as deeply conflicted about his chosen career path. That path became traceable after
he released the computer code for Nuclear Bot on GitHub. Inzirillo outed himself by

defending the sophistication of his malware after it was ridiculed by both security researchers
and denizens of the cybercrime underground, where copies of the code wound up for sale.
From that story:
“It was a big mistake, because now I know people will reuse my code to steal money
from other people,” Inzirillo told KrebsOnSecurity in an online chat.
Inzirillo released the code on GitHub with a short note explaining his motivations, and
included a contact email address at a domain (inzirillo.com) set up long ago by his
father, Daniel Inzirillo.
KrebsOnSecurity also reached out to Daniel, and heard back from him roughly an hour
before Augustin replied to requests for an interview. Inzirillo the elder said his son used
the family domain name in his source code release as part of a misguided attempt to
impress him.
“He didn’t do it for money,” said Daniel Inzirillo, whose CV shows he has built an
impressive career in computer programming and working for various financial
institutions. “He did it to spite all the cyber shitheads. The idea was that they wouldn’t
be able to sell his software anymore because it was now free for grabs.”
If Augustin Inzirillo ever did truly desire to change his ways, it wasn’t clear from his apparent
actions last summer: The Le Parisien story says the sextortion scams netted the Frenchman
and his co-conspirator at least a million Euros.
In August 2018, KrebsOnSecurity was contacted by a researcher working with French
authorities on the investigation who said he suspected the young man was bragging on
Twitter that he used a custom version of Nuclear Bot dubbed “TinyNuke” to steal funds from
customers of French and Polish banks.

The source said this individual used the now-defunct Twitter account @tiny_gang1 to taunt
French authorities, while showing off a fan of 100-Euro notes allegedly gained from his illicit
activities (see image above). It seemed to the source that Inzirillo wanted to get caught,
because at one point @tiny_gang1 even privately shared a copy of Inzirillo’s French
passport to prove his identity and accomplishments to the researcher.
“He modified the Tinynuke’s config several times, and we saw numerous modifications in the
malware code too,” the source said. “We tried to compare his samples with the leaked code
available on GitHub and we noticed that the guy actually was using a more advanced version
with features that don’t exist in the publicly available repositories. As an example, custom
samples have video recording functionality, socks proxy and other features. So the guy
clearly improved the source code and recompiled a new version for every new campaign.”

The source said the person behind the @tiny_gang Twitter account attacked French targets
with custom versions of TinyNuke in one to three campaigns per week earlier this year,
harvesting French bank accounts and laundering the stolen funds via a money mule network
based mostly in the United Kingdom.
“If the guy behind this campaign is the malware author, it could easily explain the
modifications happening with the malware, and his French is pretty good,” the researcher
told KrebsOnSecurity. “He’s really provocative and I think he wants to be arrested in France
because it could be a good way to become famous and maybe prove that his malware works
(to resell it after?).”
The source said the TinyNuke author threatened him with physical harm after the researcher
insulted his intelligence while trying to goad him into disclosing more details about his
cybercrime activities.
“The guy has a serious ego problem,” the researcher said. “He likes when we talk about him
and he hates when we mock him. He got really angry as time went by and started personally
threatening me. In the last [TinyNuke malware configuration file] targeting Poland we found a
long message dedicated to me with clear physical threats.”
All of the above is consistent with the findings detailed in the Le Parisien report, which
quoted French investigators saying Antoine I. in October 2019 used a now-deleted Twitter
account to taunt the authorities into looking for him. In one such post, he included a picture of
himself holding a beer, saying: “On the train to Naples. You should send me a registered
letter instead of threatening guys informally.”
The Le Parisien story also said Antoine I. threatened a researcher working with French
authorities on the investigation (the researcher is referred to pseudonymously as “Marc”).
“I make a lot more money than you, I am younger, more intelligent,” Antoine I. reportedly
wrote in July 2018 to Marc. “If you do not stop playing with me, I will put a bullet in your
head. ”
French authorities say the defendant managed his extortion operations while traveling
throughout Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe. But at some point he decided to
return home to France, despite knowing investigators there were hunting him. According to
Le Parisien, he told the French authorities he wanted to cooperate in the investigation and
that he no longer wished to live like a fugitive.
