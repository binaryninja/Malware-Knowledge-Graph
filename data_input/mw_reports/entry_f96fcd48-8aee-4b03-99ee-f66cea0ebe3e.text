Since the coronavirus became a worldwide health issue, the desire for more information and
guidance from government and health authorities has reached a fever pitch. This is a golden
opportunity for threat actors to capitalize on fear, spread misinformation, and generate mass
hysteria—all while compromising victims with scams or malware campaigns.
Proﬁting from global health concerns, natural disasters, and other extreme weather events is
nothing new for cybercriminals. Scams related to SARS, H1N1 (swine ﬂu), and avian ﬂu have
circulated online for more than a decade. According to reports from ZDnet, many state-sponsored
threat actors have already started to distribute coronavirus lures, including:
Chinese APTs: Vicious Panda, Mustang Panda
North Korean APTs: Kimsuky
Russian APTs: Hades group (believed to have ties with APT28), TA542 (Emotet)
Other APTs: Sweed (Lokibot)
Recently, the Red Drip team reported that APT36 was using a decoy health advisory document to
spread a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
APT36 is believed to be a Pakistani state-sponsored threat actor mainly targeting the defense,
embassies, and the government of India. APT36 performs cyber-espionage operations with the
intent of collecting sensitive information from India that supports Pakistani military and diplomatic
interests. This group, active since 2016, is also known as Transparent Tribe, ProjectM, Mythic
Leopard, and TEMP.Lapis.

APT36 mainly relies on both spear phishing and watering hole attacks to gain its foothold on
victims. The phishing email is either a malicious macro document or an rtf ﬁle exploiting
vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-0199.
In the coronavirus-themed attack, APT36 used a spear phishing email with a link to a malicious
document (Figure 1) masquerading as the government of India (email.gov.in.maildrive[.]email/?
att=1579160420).

Figure 1: Phishing document containing malicious macro code

We looked at the previous phishing campaigns related to this APT and can conﬁrm this is a new
phishing pattern from this group. The names used for directories and functions are likely Urdu
names.
The malicious document has two hidden macros that drop a RAT variant called Crimson RAT. The
malicious macro (Figure 2) ﬁrst creates two directories with the names “Edlacar” and “Uahaiws”
and then checks the OS type.

Figure 2: malicious macro

Based on the OS type, the macro picks either a 32bit or 64bit version of its RAT payload in zip
format that is stored in one of the two textboxes in UserForm1 (Figure 3).

Then it drops the zip payload into the Uahaiws directory and unzips its content using the
“UnAldizip” function, dropping the RAT payload into the Edlacar directory. Finally, it calls the Shell
function to execute the payload.

Crimson RAT
The Crimson RAT has been written in .Net (Figure 4) and its capabilities include:
Stealing credentials from the victim’s browser
Listing running processes, drives, and directories on the victim’s machine
Retrieving ﬁles from its C&C server
Using custom TCP protocol for its C&C communications
Collecting information about antivirus software
Capturing screenshots

Upon running the payload, Crimson RAT connects to its hardcoded C&C IP addresses and sends
collected information about the victim back to the server, including a list of running processes and
their IDs, the machine hostname, and its username (Figure 5).

Ongoing use of RATs
APT36 has used many different malware families in the past, but has mostly deployed RATs, such
as BreachRAT, DarkComet, Luminosity RAT, and njRAT.
In past campaigns, they were able to compromise Indian military and government databases to
steal sensitive data, including army strategy and training documents, tactical documents, and
other ofﬁcial letters. They also were able to steal personal data, such as passport scans and
personal identiﬁcation documents, text messages, and contact details.

Protection against RATs
While most general users needn’t worry about nation-state attacks, organizations wanting to
protect against this threat should consider using an endpoint protection system or endpoint
detection and response with exploit blocking and real-time malware detection.

Shoring up vulnerabilities by keeping all software (including Microsoft Excel and Word) up-to-date
shields against exploit attacks. In addition, training employees and users to avoid opening
coronavirus resources from unvetted sources can protect against this and other social
engineering attacks from threat actors.
Malwarebytes users are protected against this attack. We block the malicious macro execution as
well as its payload with our application behavior protection layer and real-time malware detection.
