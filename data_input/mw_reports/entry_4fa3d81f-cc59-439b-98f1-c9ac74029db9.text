Assembling the Russian Nesting Doll: UNC2452 Merged
into APT29
mandiant.com/resources/unc2452-merged-into-apt29

Mandiant has gathered sufficient evidence to assess that the activity tracked as UNC2452,
the group name used to track the SolarWinds compromise in December 2020, is attributable
to APT29.
This conclusion matches attribution statements previously made by the U.S. Government
that the SolarWinds supply chain compromise was conducted by APT29, a Russia-based
espionage group assessed to be sponsored by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service
(SVR). Our evaluation is based on firsthand data gathered by Mandiant and is the result of
an extensive comparison and review of UNC2452 and our detailed knowledge of APT29.
The merge of UNC2452 into APT29 significantly expands our knowledge of APT29 and
showcases an evolving, disciplined, and highly skilled threat actor that operates with a
heightened level of operational security (OPSEC) for the purposes of intelligence collection.
This blog post builds on our efforts to share information and provide awareness related to
APT29’s developments.

Evolving Tradecraft
APT29 is a highly sophisticated group that has continued to evolve and refine its operational
and behavioral tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to better obfuscate activity and
limit its digital footprint to avoid detection. The merge expands APT29’s operational profile,
emphasizing the group’s well-resourced nature, longevity of operations, time on targets,
OPSEC, adaptability, and stealth. The group has been steadily advancing its TTPs and
adopting new measures as new technologies emerge.
High Operational Tempo and Scale. Mandiant has tracked APT29 activity since at
least 2014 and despite significant public exposure following the SolarWinds
compromise in 2020, the group has continued to conduct multiple, large-scale
compromises simultaneously in different time zones throughout 2020 and 2021 at a
high operational tempo. In 2021 and 2022, we observed APT29 conduct large-scale
phishing campaigns targeting diplomatic entities in Europe, North America, and Asia.
The scale and scope of this activity suggests the group is well-resourced.
Wide Operational Scope. APT29 has targeted Western and European governments
and a range of additional industries including education, telecommunications,
government-adjacent organizations, medical research entities, and organizations that
provide third party access, such as technology companies and IT and business service
providers.

Victimology and Data Theft. APT29 has maintained a consistent focus on
aggressively gaining and maintaining access to email mailboxes. More recently, they
also targeted cloud-based resources and source code repositories to hunt for data
relevant to Russian strategic interests, conduct operational planning, and to use access
to third parties as a point of entry to downstream customers.

Figure 1: APT29 Victimology
Mandiant observed APT29 evolve its already advanced tradecraft to adapt to different victim
environments and emerging technology in the following ways:
Varying Intrusion Vectors. Since 2020, APT29 increasingly sought to exploit trust
relationships between customers and third parties and abuse the supply chain, as
evidenced by the prolific nature of the SolarWinds compromise. Mandiant observed
APT29 leverage varying operational techniques to gain initial access to victims
including stolen credentials, web server compromises, password sprays, and spear
phishing. Notably, from 2021 to the present, Mandiant observed APT29 alter its TTPs
slightly to deploy Cobalt Strike BEACON via spear phishing campaigns likely due to the
availability and success of the publicly available malware, as well as to complicate
attribution efforts given the tool’s wide use.

Heightened OPSEC. APT29 is known for its extensive operational discipline and
continues to maintain a strong OPSEC posture across all operations. APT29
demonstrates a heightened level of OPSEC to protect secondary backdoors, lateral
movement attempts, and data theft. For instance, APT29 went to considerable lengths
to hide its SUNBURST backdoor within the legitimate SolarWinds code during the initial
campaign. Additionally, Mandiant previously identified the group attempts to
compromise multiple accounts within an environment while keeping the use of each
account separate by function, using one for reconnaissance and the others for lateral
movement. This reduces the likelihood that detecting one compromised account’s
activity could expose the entire scope of the intrusion.
Since 2018, APT29 has consistently enhanced the operation security of its command
and control (C2) infrastructure using legitimate services and compromised
infrastructure, as well as using domain fronting techniques, and reliance on
anonymized internet access, such as using proxy services and the TOR network. In
addition, APT29 has continued to demonstrate a clear understanding of security
operations, incident response, remediation efforts, and network detection mechanisms.

Sophistication. APT29 has a proven ability to adapt quickly during operations. The
group uses innovative and novel techniques to bypass detection and strong
authentication requirements in victim environments. In more recent operations, their
fundamental understanding of native M365 features allowed them to move easily
between on-premises and cloud resources without using a substantial amount of
malware. We believe these measures, combined with a high level of OPSEC, longevity
of the group’s operations, and their time on targets demonstrate a well-resourced and
highly sophisticated actor.
On-prem to Cloud. APT29’s advanced knowledge of Microsoft tools and cloud
environments allows the group to abuse product features to achieve and maintain
access—despite strong authentication requirements– without using specific
vulnerabilities or deploying custom malware. This enables them to easily pivot
from on-premises networks to cloud resources to create persistent access to
targets and sensitive data. Mandiant observed APT29 target and move laterally to
the M365 environment starting in 2018 by using a combination of seven primary
techniques detailed in our guidance.
Bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): From 2018 to 2020, APT29
used an assortment of methods to satisfy strong authentication requirements in
victim environments for lateral movement. These included enrolling devices for
MFA or bypassing it via legacy authentication, adding credentials to service
principals and app registrations, and utilizing precomputed cookies to bypass
MFA requirements and log in successfully without raising any alarms. The group
also leveraged legitimate credentials to abuse repeated MFA push notifications to
an end user’s legitimate device until the user accepted the authentication. We
also observed the group evolve from using Golden Tickets to access sensitive
data from on-premises systems to Golden SAML (Security Assertion Markup
Language) for victim environments that used cloud hosted resources. Both
techniques allow attackers to bypass authentication requirements and access the
victim environment with any privileges and as any user, even after a domain-wide
password reset of user accounts.

Maintaining a Light Malware Footprint: APT29 shifted away from using a toolkit
of customized tools to maintaining a relatively light malware footprint since 2018,
likely due to extensive open-source reporting on the group’s toolkit. This allows
for fewer detection opportunities by anti-virus engines and complicates attribution
efforts. The group appears to favor the use of stolen credentials, abusing native
Microsoft features to maintain access to victim environments. In some cases, we
have observed the group shift from deploying custom tools after gaining a
foothold to deploying BEACON. This is likely due to the success, availability,
modification potential, and attribution complications provided by BEACON. From
2018 to 2021, APT29 limited their use of custom tools to a little under half of all
observed compromises. For compromises during that timeframe that featured
custom tools, APT29 used custom malware families including SUNBURST,
BEACON droppers RAINDROP and TEARDROP, a credential theft tool called
MAMADOGS, and CRIMSONBOX; a .NET tool that extracts the token signing
certificate from an ADFS configuration, assisting the group in forging SAML
tokens.
Speed and Agility. APT29 can quickly adjust their tools and TTPs to adapt to
victim environments and to retain access through remediation efforts. In multiple
cases, APT29 was able to gain Domain Administrator privileges less than 12
hours after the initial execution of a phishing payload. In 2020, approximately five
days after the public disclosure of the SolarWinds supply chain compromise,
APT29 moved the persistent BEACON backdoor to an additional system in a new
subnet following an email sent from the internal information security team to IT
administrators to request an image of the SolarWinds system. This suggests the
group was monitoring the organizations' emails and subsequently employed
countermeasures to maintain access.
Follow the Data. Since 2018, Mandiant observed APT29 adjust their tactics to
access victim environments to avoid losing access to critical data located onpremises and in cloud environments. Mandiant observed the group use different
methods to gather emails from different victim environments. These include using
publicly available tools that harvest local OST and PST files for on-premises
systems and switching to abusing service principals, adding permissions to
victims' mailboxes and mailbox folders, and using application impersonation for
cloud environments.

Outlook and Implications
Since Mandiant began tracking APT29 in 2014, the group has continued to advance its
significant technical tradecraft and OPSEC. The consistent and steady advancement in TTPs
speaks to its disciplined nature and commitment to stealthy operations and persistence.
Merging UNC2452 into APT29 has given us a better understanding of how APT29’s
operations have evolved over the years, including how the group further honed its technical
skills to bypass security controls, scale TTPs for emerging technology, blend in with victim
7/10

environments, and hinder detection across all aspects of its operations. Mandiant is almost
certain that APT29 will continue to evolve its operational and behavioral TTPs based on its
advanced skillset and ability to creatively employ novel TTPs and tools to gain persistent
access to targets.
