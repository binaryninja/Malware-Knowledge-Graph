The emergence of small groups of cyber-mercenaries available for
hire to perform surgical hit and run operations.
The world of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) is well known. Skilled adversaries
compromising high-profile victims and stealthily exfiltrating valuable data over the course of
many years. Such teams sometimes count tens or even hundreds of people, going through
terabytes or even petabytes of exfiltrated data.
Although there has been an increasing focus on attribution and pinpointing the sources of
these attacks, not much is known about a new emerging trend: the smaller hit-and-run gangs
that are going after the supply chain and compromising targets with surgical precision.
Since 2011 we have been tracking a series of attacks that we link to a threat actor called
‘Icefog’. We believe this is a relatively small group of attackers that are going after the supply
chain — targeting government institutions, military contractors, maritime and ship-building
groups, telecom operators, satellite operators, industrial and high technology companies and
mass media, mainly in South Korea and Japan. This Icefog campaigns rely on custom-made
cyber-espionage tools for Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X. The attackers directly
control the infected machines during the attacks; in addition to Icefog, we noticed them using
other malicious tools and backdoors for lateral movement and data exfiltration.

Key findings on the Icefog attacks:
The attackers rely on spear-phishing and exploits for known vulnerabilities (eg.
CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2012-1856, CVE-2013-0422 and CVE-2012-1723). The lure
documents used in the attacks are specific to the target’s interest; for instance, an
attack against a media company in Japan used the following lure:

Based on the profiles of known targets, the attackers appear to have an interest in the
following sectors: military, shipbuilding and maritime operations, research
companies, telecomoperators, satellite operators, mass media and television.

Research indicates the attackers were interested in targeting defense industry
contractors such asLig Nex1 and Selectron Industrial Company, ship-building
companies such as DSME Tech, Hanjin Heavy Industries or telecom operators such
as Korea Telecom.
The attackers are hijacking sensitive documents and company plans, e-mail account
credentials, and passwords to access various resources inside and outside the victim’s
network.
During the operation, the attackers are using the “Icefog” backdoor set (also known as
“Fucobha”). Kaspersky Lab identified versions of Icefog for both Microsoft
Windows and Mac OS X.
While in most other APT campaigns, victims remain infected for months or even years
and attackers are continuously exfiltrating data, Icefog operators are processing
victims swiftly and in a surgical manner — locating and copying only specific,
targeted information. Once the desired information is obtained, they abandon the
infection and move on.
In most cases, the Icefog operators appear to already know very well what they need
from the victims. They look for specific file names, which are identified and
transferred to the C&C.
Kaspersky Lab would like to thank KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency) and INTERPOL
for their support in this investigation.
We’re sharing Indicators of Compromise based on the OpenIOC framework for Icefog. This
way organizations have an alternative way of checking their network for presence of (active)
Icefog infections.

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware
9/11

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
