The Kingdom’s computer networks, including government servers, are reported to be the
targets of a virus unique to Cambodia and deployed through spam emails and phishing
campaigns, which lure victims with emails disguised as official communications, though
officials yesterday maintained they were unaffected.
First reported by the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks over the weekend, the attacks are
a form of Trojan – or malware disguised as legitimate software – known as “KHRAT”, which
began circulating in late June.
Attackers used a weaponised Word document in an email attachment labelled “MIWRMP
phase 3”, a reference to the $15 million World Bank-funded Mekong Integrated Water
Resources Management Phase 3 Project.
According to the security firm’s report, the virus grants hackers “access to the victim system,
including keylogging, screenshot capabilities, remote shell access and so on”.

“We believe this malware, the infrastructure being used, and the TTPs [tactics, techniques
and procedures] highlight a more sophisticated threat actor group, which we will continue to
monitor closely and report on as necessary,” Palo Alto’s report notes, adding that the attack
compromised Cambodian government servers.
Chea Pov, head of the Interior Ministry’s cybercrime unit, said while he was aware of the type
of attack, he had received no indication government officials, websites or servers had been
affected. “If this problem happens among our officials or institutions, they will submit the
complaint to us, but now I have not seen any. If we receive any complaint, we will work out
how to deal with it,” he said.
According to the World Bank website, the Mekong water management project is designed “to
establish the foundation for the effective management of water resources and fisheries in the
project areas of northeast Cambodia”.
The project also falls within the framework of the Mekong River Commission’s (MRC) work
on water management. Inquiries to the MRC and World Bank went unanswered yesterday.
Te Navuth, general secretary of the project’s implementing partner, the Cambodia National
Mekong Committee, said he was previously unaware of the cyber threat. “Now that I know
about it, I will have to think first about how this issue should be dealt with,” he said.
Cybersecurity expert Niklas Femerstrand in an email yesterday pointed out that while servers
in several different countries appear to be the origin the attack, it has been linked to the
DragonOK campaign.
“The DragonOK campaign has previously [in 2014] targeted organizations in Taiwan, Japan,
Tibet and Russia, and political organizations in Cambodia since at least January, 2017,” he
wrote, adding that there are “strong indications” the campaign is “an operation funded by
China”.
“They’re looking for any intelligence from anybody, and most probably this is linked to a wider
Advanced Persistent Threat operation . . . of which right now we are only seeing the iceberg
tip,” he wrote, referring to a continuous covert hacking process used to target a specific
entity.
Professor Carlyle Thayer, an Asian security expert at the University of New South Wales,
noted Chinese state-sponsored hacking is not necessarily always targeted, but did recall that
earlier this year “Chinese directed phishing attacks against Cambodian citizens was
reported”, and that some “seemed directed at opposition political parties”.
“While some hacking is specific, other hacking efforts are designed just to gather information
to expand files and data bases,” he wrote.

According to Femerstrand, the best protection is to not open unexpected attachments in
emails from unverified senders and to be wary of external links in documents, in addition to
keeping antivirus software up to date.
