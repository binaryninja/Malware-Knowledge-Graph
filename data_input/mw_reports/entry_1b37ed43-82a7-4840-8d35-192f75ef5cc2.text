What happened?
In March 2018 we detected an ongoing campaign targeting a national data center in the Central Asia
that we believe has been active since autumn 2017 . T he choice of target made this campaign
especially significant – it meant the attackers gained access to a wide range of government
resources at one fell swoop. We believe this access was abused, for example, by inserting malicious
scripts in the country’s official websites in order to conduct watering hole attacks.
T he operators used the HyperBro T rojan as their last-stage in-memory remote administration tool
(RAT ). T he timestamps for these modules are from December 2017 until January 2018. T he antidetection launcher and decompressor make extensive use of Metasploit’s shikata_ ga_ nai encoder as
well as LZNT 1 compression.
Kaspersky Lab products detect the different artifacts used in this campaign with the following

Who’s behind it?
Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor
(also known as EmissaryPanda and APT 27 ). Also the C2 domain update.iaacstudio[.]com was
previously used in their campaigns. T he tools found in this campaign, such as the HyperBro T rojan,
are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. Regarding Metasploit’s shikata_ ga_ nai
encoder – although it’s available for everyone and couldn’t be the basis for attribution, we know this
encoder has been used by LuckyMouse previously.
Government entities, including the Central Asian ones also were a target for this actor before. Due to
LuckyMouse’s ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect
that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject
JavaScripts into them.

How did the malware spread?
T he initial infection vector used in the attack against the data center is unclear. Even when we
observed LuckyMouse using weaponized documents with CVE-2017 -118822 (Microsoft Office
Equation Editor, widely used by Chinese-speaking actors since December 2017 ), we can´t prove they
were related to this particular attack. It’s possible the actor used a waterhole to infect data center
employees.
T he main C2 used in this campaign is bbs.sonypsps[.]com, which resolved to IP-address, that belongs
to the Ukrainian ISP network, held by a Mikrotik router using firmware version 6.34.4 (from March
2016) with SMBv1 on board. We suspect this router was hacked as part of the campaign in order to
process the malware’s HT T P requests. T he Sonypsps[.]com domain was last updated using GoDaddy
on 2017 -05-05 until 2019-03-13.

FMikrotik router with two- year- old firmware and SMBv1 on board used in this c ampaign
In March 2017 , Wikileaks published details about an exploit affecting Mikrotik called ChimayRed.
According to the documentation, however, it doesn’t work for firmware versions higher than 6.30.
T his router uses version 6.34.
T here were traces of HyperBro in the infected data center from mid-November 2017 . Shortly after
that different users in the country started being redirected to the malicious domain
update.iaacstudio[.]com as a result of the waterholing of government websites. T hese events suggest
that the data center infected with HyperBro and the waterholing campaign are connected.

center?

Anti- detec tion stages. Different c olors show the three dropped modules: legit app (blue),
launc her (green), and dec ompressor with the Trojan embedded (red)
T he initial module drops three files that are typical for Chinese-speaking actors: a legit Symantec
pcAnywhere (IntgStat.exe) for DLL side loading, a .dll launcher (pcalocalresloader.dll) and the laststage decompressor (thumb.db). As a result of all these steps, the last-stage T rojan is injected into
svchost.exe’s process memory.
T he launcher module, obfuscated with the notorious Metasploit’s shikata_ ga_ nai encoder, is the
same for all the droppers. T he resulting deobfuscated code performs typical side loading: it patches
pcAnywhere’s image in memory at its entry point. T he patched code jumps back to the decryptor’s
second shikata_ ga_ nai iteration, but this time as part of the whitelisted application.
T his Metasploit’s encoder obfuscates the last part of the launcher’s code, which in turn resolves the

necessary API and maps thumb.db into the same process’s (pcAnywhere) memory. T he first
instructions in the mapped thumb.db are for a new shikata_ ga_ nai iteration. T he decrypted code
resolves the necessary API functions, decompresses the embedded PE file with RtlCompressBuffer()
using LZNT 1 and maps it into memory.

What does the resulting watering hole
look like?
T he websites were compromised to redirect visitors to instances of both ScanBox and BEeF. T hese
redirects were implemented by adding two malicious scripts obfuscated by a tool similar to the Dean
Edwards packer.

Users were redirected to https://google-updata[.]tk:443/hook.js, a BEeF instance, and
https://windows-updata[.]tk:443/scanv1.8/i/?1, an empty ScanBox instance that answered a small
piece of JavaScript code.

Conclusions
LuckyMouse appears to have been very active recently. T he T T Ps for this campaign are quite
common for Chinese-speaking actors, where they typically provide new solid wrappers (launcher and
decompressor protected with shikata_ ga_ nai in this case) around their RAT s (HyperBro).
T he most unusual and interesting point here is the target. A national data center is a valuable source
of data that can also be abused to compromise official websites. Another interesting point is the
Mikrotik router, which we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign. T he reasons for this are
not very clear: typically, Chinese-speaking actors don’t bother disguising their campaigns. Maybe
these are the first steps in a new stealthier approach.
