Malicious Telegram Installer Drops Purple Fox Rootkit

We have often observed threat actors using legitimate software for dropping malicious files. This time
however is different. This threat actor was able to leave most parts of the attack under the radar by
separating the attack into several small files, most of which had very low detection rates by AV engines,
with the final stage leading to Purple Fox rootkit infection.
Thanks to the MalwareHunterTeam, we were able to dig deeper into the malicious Telegram Installer. This
installer is a compiled AutoIt (a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating Windows
GUI and general scripting) script called “Telegram Desktop.exe”:

This AutoIt script is the first stage of the attack which creates a new folder named “TextInputh” under
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp\ and drops a legitimate Telegram installer (which is not even
executed) and a malicious downloader (TextInputh.exe).

TextInputh.exe
When executed, TextInputh.exe creates a new folder named “1640618495” under the
C:\Users\Public\Videos\ directory. TextInputh.exe file is used as a downloader for the next stage of the
attack. It contacts a C&C server and downloads two files to the newly created folder:
1. 1.rar – which contains the files for the next stage. 7zz.exe – a legitimate 7z archiver.
2. The 7zz.exe is used to unarchive 1.rar, which contains the following files:

Next, TextInputh.exe performs the following actions:
Copies 360.tct with “360.dll” name, rundll3222.exe and svchost.txt to the ProgramData folder
Executes ojbk.exe with the “ojbk.exe -a” command line
Deletes 1.rar and 7zz.exe and exits the process
ojbk.exe
When executed with the “-a” argument, this file is only used to reflectively load the malicious 360.dll file:

This DLL is responsible for reading the dropped svchost.txt file. After which, a new
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Select\MarkTime registry key is created, whose value equals the
current time of svchost.exe and then, the svchost.txt payload is executed.
svchost.txt
As the attack flow continues, this file appears to contain the byte code of the next stage of the malicious
payload executed by the 360.dll. As the first action of svchost.txt, it checks for the existence of the
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\360safe.exe\Path registry key. If the
registry key is found, the attack flow will perform an additional step before moving on to the next stage:
The attack drops five more files into the ProgramData folder:
Calldriver.exe – this file is used to shut down and block initiation of 360 AV
Driver.sys – after this file is dropped, a new system driver service named “Driver” is created and
started on the infected PC and bmd.txt is created in the ProgramData folder

dll.dll – executed after UAC bypass. The UAC bypass technique used by svchost.txt is a “UAC
bypass using CMSTPLUA COM interface” and is well described here. This technique is commonly
used by the LockBit and BlackMatter ransomware authors. The dll.dll is executed with the
“C:\ProgramData\dll.dll, luohua” command line.
kill.bat – a batch script which is executed after the file drop ends. The script is:

speedmem2.hg - SQLite file

All these files work together to shut down and block the initiation of 360 AV processes from the kernel
space, thus allowing the next stage attack tools (Purple Fox Rootkit, in our case) to run without being
detected.
After the file drop and execution, the payload moves to the next step, which is the C&C communication.
As mentioned above, if the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App
Paths\360safe.exe\Path registry key is not found, the flow just skips to this step.
First, the hardcoded C&C address is added as a mutex. Next, the following victim’s information is
gathered:
1. Hostname
2. CPU – by retrieving a value of HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\0\
~MHz registry key

3. Memory status
4. Drive Type
5. Processor Type – by calling GetNativeSystemInfo and checking the value of
wProcessorArchitecture.

Next, the malware checks if any of the following processes are running on the victim’s PC:
360tray.exe – 360 Total Security

It seems that after this check is complete, all the collected information, including which security products
are running, is sent to the C&C server.
At the time of the investigation, the C&C server was already down, but a quick check of the IP address
and other related files all indicate that the last stage of this attack is the download and execution of the
Purple Fox Rootkit. Purple Fox uses the msi.dll function, 'MsiInstallProductA', to download and execute its
payload. The payload is a .msi file that contains encrypted shellcode including 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
Once executed, the system will be restarted with the 'PendingFileRenameOperations' registry to rename
its components. In our case the Purple Fox Rootkit is downloaded from
hxxp://144.48.243[.]79:17674/C558B828.Png.
Dll.dll
This DLL is only used for disabling UAC by setting the three following registry keys to 0:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\PromptOnSecureDesktop

Calldriver.exe
Used to shut down and block initiation of 360 AV processes from the kernel space. The technique used is
described here under “The ProcessKiller rootkit vs. security products” paragraph.

6/9

We found a large number of malicious installers delivering the same Purple Fox rootkit version using the
same attack chain. It seems like some were delivered via email, while others we assume were
downloaded from phishing websites. The beauty of this attack is that every stage is separated to a
different file which are useless without the entire file set. This helps the attacker protect his files from AV
detection.
