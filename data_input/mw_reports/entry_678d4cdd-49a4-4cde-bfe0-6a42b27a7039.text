Author of Sality

2015 LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Inc.

Author of Sality?
According to Symantec [1]:
“the curious reader asking where the name “Sality” originated from now has the
answer: it is derived from “Salavat City”, a Russian town from which the author
may originate. This threat bears a couple of other names, also related to strings
found inside the payload: “Kuku” (which means Hide-and-Seek in Russian), or
“Sector” (the nickname of the author).”

Author of Sality?
In those old emails there appear 3 nick-names:
1. Sector
2. iMAGER
3. Alien-Z
Those emails were used in the early samples:
Sender: 11581@mail.ru
Receiver: lamercool@rambler.ru,
alien-z@mail.ru, imager@mail.ru

Statistics
The reasons mostly 3rd world countries are affected are:

1. Pirated Windows with updates disabled
2. Often no AV installed; Sality’s detection is
VERY high, pretty much any AV detects &
removes it

Technical Information

2015 LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Inc.

Botnets?
 Only active botnets are #3 and #4, both are independent P2P botnets
 Network 1/2: Both dead
 Network 3: Since 2009, current version 241
 Network 4: Since 2010, current version 96

 Version numbers here are via URL packs
 So 241 + 96 different sets of C&C URLs
 If you know all the URL packs you can sinkhole them and find out info of old infections!

 You can find many domains from the URL packs in reports on the internet

2015 LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Inc.

Network #2 Sample
Injects into explorer.exe, starts immediately with the P2P algorithm and then falls
back to a hard-coded list of domains.

MD5 334B385F8DD9A8C70CF70D0D2BF9F9E7
SHA1 9B11CD8822F780275F23155AC0F92B44E9081A04
2015 LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Inc.

Network #3 Sample
Injects into a random process
Annoying port behavior – reinventing the TCP wheel over UDP:

MD5 B2FB74393D65E8CF91158D6DAAADC70A
SHA1 257E841963D52D2691D34AAE3E1EF7FCB95F4C99
2015 LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Inc.

P2P Algorithm
 UDP; default port 9674 but calculated from the computer name
 Peers keep a “goodcount” value -> makes fake peer injection more difficult
 Networks 3/4 have nearly the same commands (only the URL pack payload is
slightly different):
 Network 4 uses 2048 RSA instead of 1024 for the certificate
 Network 4 opens a TCP port on default 9673 for file transfer

2015 LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Inc.

P2P Algorithm
 Reinventing the TCP wheel
 “OK” responses
 One UDP port per connection (annoying); has a time-out
 One port always open for incoming control connections

 Basic commands:
 1 = Announcement & Promotion (“here I am!”, shares port number)
 2 = Peer Exchange (exchanging 1 single peer: IP:Port)
 3 = Pack Exchange (exchanging the URL list, both ways)

 Assigning internal (NOT shared) peer ids:
 < 16000000: low peer id, not reachable from outside (NAT)
 >: High peer id, supernode

URL Packs

http://slwocfd/sobaka1.gif
http://46.105.103.219/sobakavolos.gif

 There is no .ds TLD!
 “slwocfd” is not a valid domain as well!
 Unknown why they use invalid URLs.

More interesting observations
One C&C domain:
0-0-1-1-1-0-1-1-1-0-0-1-1-0-1-0-1-1-0-0-1-0-0-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-.0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-49-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.info
Yes that’s a valid domain.

Domains are easy to find, they usually use “/logo.gif” or similar document paths.
It creates the mutexes “purity_control_4428” and “kukutrusted!” to verify if it’s
already running. [4]

2015 LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Inc.

URLs in the URL Packs
 Every URL points to an executable file that is simply RC4 encrypted in blocks
 It is downloaded by Sality and executed
char * Sality_C2_Key = "GdiPlus.dll";
for (unsigned n = 0; n < Sality_C2_Payload_Size; n += 1024)
rc4((BYTE *)Sality_C2_Payload + n, 1024, (BYTE *)Sality_C2_Key, strlen(Sality_C2_Key));

 No certificate! Anyone can encrypt executables and distribute to Sality infections
by taking over existing C&C URLs (registering expired ones).
 (vs RSA signature in P2P commands)
 (interestingly there is no C&C panel – just the plain binary on servers)

 MSRT will kill it
http://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2012/02/21/pramro-and-sality-two-pes-in-a-pod.aspx

“The second of the families added to the February release of the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) is Win32/Pramro.
Win32/Pramro is a family of trojans that can act as a SOCKS proxy on an infected computer. In this case, this proxy may be used to relay spam and
HTTP traffic. Detection was first added for Pramro variants in January 2008.
There is a strong connection with the polymorphic file infector Win32/Sality, which shares portions of code with Pramo.“

How to remove globally

Enable Windows update everywhere?
P2P botnet control is not an option without having the secret RSA key to sign
commands.
Potentially send a disinfector via the URL pack channels; however that would
require takeover of legitimate websites

Conclusion
 Simple file infector + rootkit + mass = success

 Didn’t get much attention
 Probably the oldest still actively maintained Trojan?
