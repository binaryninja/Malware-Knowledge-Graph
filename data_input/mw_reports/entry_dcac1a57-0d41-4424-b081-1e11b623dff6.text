The likely Chinese government-sponsored threat group uses decoy documents and PlugX
malware to compromise targets. Thursday, September 8, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit
Research Team
In June and July 2022, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers identified a
PlugX malware campaign targeting computers belonging to government officials of several
countries in Europe, the Middle East, and South America. PlugX is modular malware that
contacts a command and control (C2) server for tasking and can download additional plugins
to enhance its capability beyond basic information gathering. Several characteristics of this
campaign indicate that it was conducted by the likely Chinese government-sponsored
BRONZE PRESIDENT threat group, including the use of PlugX, file paths and naming
schemes previously used by the threat group, the presence of shellcode in executable file
headers, and politically-themed decoy documents that align with regions where China has
interests.
The malware is embedded within RAR archive files. Opening the archive on a Windows
computer with default settings displays a Windows shortcut (LNK) file (see Figure 1) that
masquerades as a document.

Alongside the shortcut is a hidden folder that contains the malware, embedded eight levels
deep in a sequence of hidden folders named with special characters (see Figure 2). This
tiering is likely to bypass mail-scanning products that may not traverse the entire path when
scanning content, suggesting that the delivery mechanism was phishing emails, as there is no
other benefit to creating such a folder structure.

To execute the malware, the recipient must click the Windows shortcut file. The shortcut
executes a renamed legitimate file contained in the eighth hidden folder. Alongside the
legitimate file is a malicious DLL and an encrypted payload file. CTU™ researchers observed
the malicious payload using the folder names and filenames in Table 1.

Table 1. Filenames used in PlugX campaign.
The legitimate binary files are vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking. When executed, they
import the malicious DLL that loads, decrypts, and executes the payload file. In each sample
analyzed by CTU researchers, the shortcut file metadata indicates the file was created on a
Windows system either with hostname "desktop-n2v1smh" or "desktop-cb248vr".
Once running, the payload drops a decoy document to the logged-on user's %Temp%
directory and copies the three files to a ProgramData subdirectory using the pattern "
<Application><3 characters>" (e.g., Operavng) (see Figure 3). This naming scheme has been
used in previous BRONZE PRESIDENT PlugX campaigns. CTU researchers observed that
when the payload performs the copy operation, it names the legitimate executable with its
usual name (e.g., Opera.exe, AdobePlugin.exe, AvastBrowser.exe).

Figure 3. PlugX files copied to ProgramData subdirectory. (Source: Secureworks)
The political nature of the decoy documents suggests that the government officials of various
countries are targets for BRONZE PRESIDENT's intelligence collection efforts (see Figures 4,
5, and 6). The threat group consistently targets China's neighbors such as Myanmar and
Vietnam. However, its collection requirements can change quickly and are often driven by
geopolitical events such as the war in Ukraine.

PlugX sets up persistence on the host by setting a registry Run key (see Figure 7).

Figure 7. PlugX registry configuration. (Source: Secureworks)
The running instance of the PlugX payload executes the copy of the legitimate file under
ProgramData, passing it a command-line argument before exiting (see Figure 8). Passing
command-line arguments lets the malware adapt its execution based on its execution
location. CTU researchers observed this tactic in previous BRONZE PRESIDENT PlugX
campaigns. Once running, the legitimate file again imports the malicious DLL in the same
folder, loading, decoding, and passing execution to the malicious payload file.

The payload file calls GetCommandLineW to check the number of arguments. If an additional
argument follows the file path, the malware opens the decoy document previously dropped to
the user's %Temp% folder and continues execution with its C2 routine.
The malicious DLLs and payloads are heavily obfuscated to hinder analysis and to reduce the
likelihood of detection by host-based security software. The malicious DLL executes its
payload using an unusual technique. Instead of using a call or jmp instruction, it first decodes
and copies the payload to a new allocation of memory and then makes a call to
EnumThreadWindows to pass execution to the start of the malicious payload file (see Figure
9).

Figure 9. Malicious DLL calling EnumThreadWindows. (Source: Secureworks)
The start of the payload file is treated as executable code in the same way as a Cobalt Strike
stageless payload artifact. This could be a tactic developed by BRONZE PRESIDENT to
increase the likelihood of its malware being misidentified as the popular Cobalt Strike tool.
The payload resolves various required Windows functions. It then starts a new thread that
makes repeated calls to CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent, exiting if it detects a debugger.
Figure 10 shows the payload preparing to decode its configuration. The values pushed to the
stack are key length, key, data length, and data address. The key is used as a multibyte XOR
value. All observed key value lengths are nine bytes, and their values vary across samples.

Figure 11 shows the beginning of the decoded configuration, including the installation
directory, mutex name, and the name of the decoy document associated with the sample.

BRONZE PRESIDENT has demonstrated an ability to pivot quickly for new intelligence
collection opportunities. Organizations in geographic regions of interest to China should
closely monitor this group's activities, especially organizations associated with or operating as
government agencies.
To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use
available controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 2. Note that
IP addresses can be reallocated. The IP addresses may contain malicious content, so consider
the risks before opening them in a browser.
