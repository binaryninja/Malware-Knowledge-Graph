Threat Actors Exploiting Multiple CVEs Against
Zimbra Collaboration Suite
SUMMARY
Update November 10, 2022: This product was written
by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) and the Multi-State Information
Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) with
contributions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI).

Actions for ZCS administrators to
take today to mitigate malicious
cyber activity:

CISA and the MS-ISAC are publishing this joint
Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to active
exploitation of multiple Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVEs) against Zimbra Collaboration Suite
(ZCS), an enterprise cloud-hosted collaboration software
and email platform. CVEs currently being exploited
against ZCS include:

•

•
•
•
•

•

•

Patch all systems and prioritize
patching known exploited
vulnerabilities.
Deploy detection signatures and
hunt for indicators of compromise
(IOCs).
If ZCS was compromised, remediate
malicious activity.

CVE-2022-24682
CVE-2022-27924
CVE-2022-27925 chained with CVE-2022-37042
CVE-2022-30333

Cyber threat actors may be targeting unpatched ZCS instances in both government and private sector
networks. CISA and the MS-ISAC strongly urge users and administrators to apply the guidance in the
Recommendations section of this CSA to help secure their organization’s systems against malicious
cyber activity. CISA and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations who did not immediately update their
To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at

TECHNICAL DETAILS
CVE-2022-27924
CVE-2022-27924 is a high-severity vulnerability enabling an unauthenticated malicious actor to inject
arbitrary memcache commands into a targeted ZCS instance and cause an overwrite of arbitrary
cached entries. The actor can then steal ZCS email account credentials in cleartext form without any
user interaction. With valid email account credentials in an organization not enforcing multifactor
authentication (MFA), a malicious actor can use spear phishing, social engineering, and business
email compromise (BEC) attacks against the compromised organization. Additionally, malicious
actors could use the valid account credentials to open webshells and maintain persistent access.
On March 11, 2022, researchers from SonarSource announced the discovery of this ZCS
vulnerability. Zimbra issued fixes for releases 8.8.15 and 9.0 on May 10, 2022. Based on evidence of
active exploitation, CISA added this vulnerability to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on
August 4, 2022. Due to ease of exploitation, CISA and the MS-ISAC expect to see widespread
exploitation of unpatched ZCS instances in government and private networks.

CVE-2022-27925 and CVE-2022-37042
CVE-2022-27925 is a high-severity vulnerability in ZCS releases 8.8.15 and 9.0 that have
mboximport functionality to receive a ZIP archive and extract files from it. An authenticated user has
the ability to upload arbitrary files to the system thereby leading to directory traversal.[1] On August
10, 2022, researchers from Volexity reported widespread exploitation—against over 1,000 ZCS
instances—of CVE-2022-27925 in conjunction with CVE-2022-37042.[2] CISA added both CVEs to
the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on August 11, 2022.
CVE-2022-37042 is an authentication bypass vulnerability that affects ZCS releases 8.8.15 and 9.0.
CVE-2022-37042 could allow an unauthenticated malicious actor access to a vulnerable ZCS

instance. According to Zimbra, CVE-2022-37042 is found in the MailboxImportServlet
function.[3][4] Zimbra issued fixes in late July 2022.

CVE-2022-30333
CVE-2022-30333 is a high-severity directory traversal vulnerability in RARLAB UnRAR on Linux and
UNIX allowing a malicious actor to write to files during an extract (unpack) operation. A malicious
actor can exploit CVE-2022-30333 against a ZCS server by sending an email with a malicious RAR
file. Upon email receipt, the ZCS server would automatically extract the RAR file to check for spam or
malware.[5] Any ZCS instance with unrar installed is vulnerable to CVE-2022-30333.
Researchers from SonarSource shared details about this vulnerability in June 2022.[6] Zimbra made
configuration changes to use the 7zip program instead of unrar.[7] CISA added CVE-2022-3033 to
the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on August 9, 2022. Based on industry reporting, a
malicious cyber actor is selling a cross-site scripting (XSS) exploit kit for the ZCS vulnerability to
CVE-2022-30333. A Metasploit module is also available that creates a RAR file that can be emailed
to a ZCS server to exploit CVE-2022-30333.[8]

CVE-2022-24682
CVE-2022-24682 is a medium-severity vulnerability that impacts ZCS webmail clients running
releases before 8.8.15 patch 30 (update 1), which contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
allowing malicious actors to steal session cookie files. Researchers from Volexity shared this
vulnerability on February 3, 2022[9], and Zimbra issued a fix on February 4, 2022.[10] CISA added
this vulnerability to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on February 25, 2022.

DETECTION METHODS
Note: CISA and the MS-ISAC will update this section with additional IOCs and signatures as further
information becomes available.
CISA recommends administrators, especially at organizations that did not immediately update their
ZCS instances upon patch release, to hunt for malicious activity using the following third-party
detection signatures:

Additionally, CISA and the MS-ISAC recommend organizations apply the following best practices to
reduce risk of compromise:
•
•

•

•

Maintain and test an incident response plan.
Ensure your organization has a vulnerability management program in place and that it
prioritizes patch management and vulnerability scanning of known exploited vulnerabilities.
Note: CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Services (CyHy) are free to all state, local, tribal, and territorial
(SLTT) organizations, as well as public and private sector critical infrastructure organizations:
cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services.
Properly configure and secure internet-facing network devices.
o Do not expose management interfaces to the internet.
o Disable unused or unnecessary network ports and protocols.
o Disable/remove unused network services and devices.
Adopt zero-trust principles and architecture, including:
o Micro-segmenting networks and functions to limit or block lateral movements.
o Enforcing phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users and VPN
connections.
o Restricting access to trusted devices and users on the networks.

INCIDENT RESPONSE
If an organization’s system has been compromised by active or recently active threat actors in their
environment, CISA and the MS-ISAC recommend the following initial steps:
1. Collect and review artifacts, such as running processes/services, unusual authentications,
and recent network connections.
2. Quarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts.
3. Reimage compromised hosts.
4. Provision new account credentials.
5. Report the compromise to CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or
888-282-0870). SLTT government entities can also report to the MS-ISAC
(SOC@cisecurity.org or 866-787-4722).
See the joint CSA from the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious
Activity for additional guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in
incident handling. CISA and the MS-ISAC also encourage government network administrators to see
CISA’s Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although
tailored to federal civilian branch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures for
planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail steps
for both incident and vulnerability response.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
CISA and the MS-ISAC would like to thank Volexity and Secureworks for their contributions to this
advisory.
