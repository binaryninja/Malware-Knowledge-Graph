Briefing Room
• Presidential Actions
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United
States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated
malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately
the American people’s security and privacy. The Federal Government must improve its
efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to these actions and actors.
The Federal Government must also carefully examine what occurred during any major cyber
incident and apply lessons learned. But cybersecurity requires more than government
action. Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government
to partner with the private sector. The private sector must adapt to the continuously
changing threat environment, ensure its products are built and operate securely, and partner
with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace. In the end, the trust we
place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how trustworthy and transparent
that infrastructure is, and to the consequences we will incur if that trust is misplaced.

1/18

Incremental improvements will not give us the security we need; instead, the Federal
Government needs to make bold changes and significant investments in order to defend the
vital institutions that underpin the American way of life. The Federal Government must bring
to bear the full scope of its authorities and resources to protect and secure its computer
systems, whether they are cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid. The scope of protection and
security must include systems that process data (information technology (IT)) and those that
run the vital machinery that ensures our safety (operational technology (OT)).
It is the policy of my Administration that the prevention, detection, assessment, and
remediation of cyber incidents is a top priority and essential to national and economic
security. The Federal Government must lead by example. All Federal Information Systems
should meet or exceed the standards and requirements for cybersecurity set forth in and
issued pursuant to this order.
Sec. 2. Removing Barriers to Sharing Threat Information.
(a) The Federal Government contracts with IT and OT service providers to conduct an
array of day-to-day functions on Federal Information Systems. These service providers,
including cloud service providers, have unique access to and insight into cyber threat and
incident information on Federal Information Systems. At the same time, current contract
terms or restrictions may limit the sharing of such threat or incident information with
executive departments and agencies (agencies) that are responsible for investigating or
remediating cyber incidents, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other elements of the Intelligence
Community (IC). Removing these contractual barriers and increasing the sharing of
information about such threats, incidents, and risks are necessary steps to accelerating
incident deterrence, prevention, and response efforts and to enabling more effective defense
of agencies’ systems and of information collected, processed, and maintained by or for
the Federal Government.
(b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the
Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement contract requirements and language for contracting with IT and OT service
providers and recommend updates to such requirements and language to the FAR Council
and other appropriate agencies. The recommendations shall include descriptions of
contractors to be covered by the proposed contract language.
(c) The recommended contract language and requirements described in subsection (b) of
this section shall be designed to ensure that:
(i) service providers collect and preserve data, information, and reporting relevant to
cybersecurity event prevention, detection, response, and investigation on all information
systems over which they have control, including systems operated on behalf of agencies,
consistent with agencies’ requirements;
(ii) service providers share such data, information, and reporting, as they relate to
cyber incidents or potential incidents relevant to any agency with which they have
2/18

contracted, directly with such agency and any other agency that the Director of OMB, in
consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland
Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, deems appropriate, consistent with
applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies;
(iii) service providers collaborate with Federal cybersecurity or investigative agencies
in their investigations of and responses to incidents or potential incidents on Federal
Information Systems, including by implementing technical capabilities, such as monitoring
networks for threats in collaboration with agencies they support, as needed; and
(iv) service providers share cyber threat and incident information with agencies, doing
so, where possible, in industry-recognized formats for incident response and remediation.
(d) Within 90 days of receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (b) of this
section, the FAR Council shall review the proposed contract language and conditions and, as
appropriate, shall publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.
(e) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the
Director of OMB shall take appropriate steps to ensure to the greatest extent possible that
service providers share data with agencies, CISA, and the FBI as may be necessary for the
Federal Government to respond to cyber threats, incidents, and risks.
(f) It is the policy of the Federal Government that:
(i) information and communications technology (ICT) service providers entering into
contracts with agencies must promptly report to such agencies when they discover a cyber
incident involving a software product or service provided to such agencies or involving a
support system for a software product or service provided to such agencies;
(ii) ICT service providers must also directly report to CISA whenever they report
under subsection (f)(i) of this section to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) Agencies,
and CISA must centrally collect and manage such information; and
(iii) reports pertaining to National Security Systems, as defined in section 10(h) of this
order, must be received and managed by the appropriate agency as to be determined under
subsection (g)(i)(E) of this section.
(g) To implement the policy set forth in subsection (f) of this section:
(i) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in
consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the National
Security Agency (NSA), the Attorney General, and the Director of OMB, shall recommend to
the FAR Council contract language that identifies:
(A) the nature of cyber incidents that require reporting;
(B) the types of information regarding cyber incidents that require reporting to
facilitate effective cyber incident response and remediation;
(C) appropriate and effective protections for privacy and civil liberties;
(D) the time periods within which contractors must report cyber incidents based on
a graduated scale of severity, with reporting on the most severe cyber incidents not to
exceed 3 days after initial detection;
(E) National Security Systems reporting requirements; and
(F) the type of contractors and associated service providers to be covered by the

3/18

proposed contract language.
(ii) Within 90 days of receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (g)(i) of
this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommendations and publish for public
comment proposed updates to the FAR.
(iii) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense acting through
the Director of the NSA, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the
Director of National Intelligence shall jointly develop procedures for ensuring that cyber
incident reports are promptly and appropriately shared among agencies.
(h) Current cybersecurity requirements for unclassified system contracts are largely
implemented through agency-specific policies and regulations, including cloud-service
cybersecurity requirements. Standardizing common cybersecurity contractual requirements
across agencies will streamline and improve compliance for vendors and the Federal
Government.
(i) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting
through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through
the Director of the NSA, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of General Services,
shall review agency-specific cybersecurity requirements that currently exist as a matter of
law, policy, or contract and recommend to the FAR Council standardized contract language
for appropriate cybersecurity requirements. Such recommendations shall include
consideration of the scope of contractors and associated service providers to be covered by
the proposed contract language.
(j) Within 60 days of receiving the recommended contract language developed pursuant
to subsection (i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommended contract
language and publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.
(k) Following any updates to the FAR made by the FAR Council after the public comment
period described in subsection (j) of this section, agencies shall update their agency-specific
cybersecurity requirements to remove any requirements that are duplicative of such FAR
updates.
(l) The Director of OMB shall incorporate into the annual budget process a cost analysis
of all recommendations developed under this section.
Sec. 3. Modernizing Federal Government Cybersecurity.
(a) To keep pace with today’s dynamic and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat
environment, the Federal Government must take decisive steps to modernize its approach to
cybersecurity, including by increasing the Federal Government’s visibility into threats, while
protecting privacy and civil liberties. The Federal Government must adopt security best
practices; advance toward Zero Trust Architecture; accelerate movement to secure cloud
services, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and
Platform as a Service (PaaS); centralize and streamline access to cybersecurity data to drive
analytics for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; and invest in both technology and
personnel to match these modernization goals.
(b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall:
(i) update existing agency plans to prioritize resources for the adoption and use of
4/18

cloud technology as outlined in relevant OMB guidance;
(ii) develop a plan to implement Zero Trust Architecture, which shall incorporate, as
appropriate, the migration steps that the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) within the Department of Commerce has outlined in standards and guidance,
describe any such steps that have already been completed, identify activities that will have
the most immediate security impact, and include a schedule to implement them; and
(iii) provide a report to the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President and
National Security Advisor (APNSA) discussing the plans required pursuant to subsection (b)
(i) and (ii) of this section.
(c) As agencies continue to use cloud technology, they shall do so in a coordinated,
deliberate way that allows the Federal Government to prevent, detect, assess, and
remediate cyber incidents. To facilitate this approach, the migration to cloud technology shall
adopt Zero Trust Architecture, as practicable. The CISA shall modernize its current
cybersecurity programs, services, and capabilities to be fully functional with cloud-computing
environments with Zero Trust Architecture. The Secretary of Homeland Security acting
through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services
acting through the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) within
the General Services Administration, shall develop security principles governing Cloud
Service Providers (CSPs) for incorporation into agency modernization efforts. To facilitate
this work:
(i) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB, in consultation with
the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, and the
Administrator of General Services acting through FedRAMP, shall develop a Federal cloudsecurity strategy and provide guidance to agencies accordingly. Such guidance shall seek to
ensure that risks to the FCEB from using cloud-based services are broadly understood and
effectively addressed, and that FCEB Agencies move closer to Zero Trust Architecture.
(ii) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting
through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of OMB and the Administrator
of General Services acting through FedRAMP, shall develop and issue, for the FCEB, cloudsecurity technical reference architecture documentation that illustrates recommended
approaches to cloud migration and data protection for agency data collection and reporting.
(iii) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting
through the Director of CISA shall develop and issue, for FCEB Agencies, a cloud-service
governance framework. That framework shall identify a range of services and protections
available to agencies based on incident severity. That framework shall also identify data
and processing activities associated with those services and protections.
(iv) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the heads of FCEB Agencies, in
consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA,
shall evaluate the types and sensitivity of their respective agency’s unclassified data, and
shall provide to the Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA and to the
Director of OMB a report based on such evaluation. The evaluation shall prioritize
identification of the unclassified data considered by the agency to be the most sensitive and

5/18

under the greatest threat, and appropriate processing and storage solutions for those data.
(d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, agencies shall adopt multi-factor
authentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit, to the maximum extent
consistent with Federal records laws and other applicable laws. To that end:
(i) Heads of FCEB Agencies shall provide reports to the Secretary of Homeland
Security through the Director of CISA, the Director of OMB, and the APNSA on their
respective agency’s progress in adopting multifactor authentication and encryption of data at
rest and in transit. Such agencies shall provide such reports every 60 days after the date of
this order until the agency has fully adopted, agency-wide, multi-factor authentication and
data encryption.
(ii) Based on identified gaps in agency implementation, CISA shall take all
appropriate steps to maximize adoption by FCEB Agencies of technologies and processes to
implement multifactor authentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit.
(iii) Heads of FCEB Agencies that are unable to fully adopt multi-factor authentication
and data encryption within 180 days of the date of this order shall, at the end of the 180-day
period, provide a written rationale to the Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director
of CISA, the Director of OMB, and the APNSA.
(e) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting
through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of the
FBI, and the Administrator of General Services acting through the Director of FedRAMP,
shall establish a framework to collaborate on cybersecurity and incident response activities
related to FCEB cloud technology, in order to ensure effective information sharing among
agencies and between agencies and CSPs.
(f) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of General Services, in
consultation with the Director of OMB and the heads of other agencies as the Administrator
of General Services deems appropriate, shall begin modernizing FedRAMP by:
(i) establishing a training program to ensure agencies are effectively trained and
equipped to manage FedRAMP requests, and providing access to training materials,
including videos-on-demand;
(ii) improving communication with CSPs through automation and standardization of
messages at each stage of authorization. These communications may include status
updates, requirements to complete a vendor’s current stage, next steps, and points of
contact for questions;
(iii) incorporating automation throughout the lifecycle of FedRAMP, including
assessment, authorization, continuous monitoring, and compliance;
(iv) digitizing and streamlining documentation that vendors are required to complete,
including through online accessibility and pre-populated forms; and
(v) identifying relevant compliance frameworks, mapping those frameworks onto
requirements in the FedRAMP authorization process, and allowing those frameworks to be
used as a substitute for the relevant portion of the authorization process, as appropriate.
Sec. 4. Enhancing Software Supply Chain Security.
(a) The security of software used by the Federal Government is vital to the Federal
6/18

Government’s ability to perform its critical functions. The development of commercial
software often lacks transparency, sufficient focus on the ability of the software to resist
attack, and adequate controls to prevent tampering by malicious actors. There is a pressing
need to implement more rigorous and predictable mechanisms for ensuring that products
function securely, and as intended. The security and integrity of “critical software” —
software that performs functions critical to trust (such as affording or requiring elevated
system privileges or direct access to networking and computing resources) — is a particular
concern. Accordingly, the Federal Government must take action to rapidly improve the
security and integrity of the software supply chain, with a priority on addressing critical
software.
(b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce acting through
the Director of NIST shall solicit input from the Federal Government, private sector,
academia, and other appropriate actors to identify existing or develop new standards, tools,
and best practices for complying with the standards, procedures, or criteria in subsection (e)
of this section. The guidelines shall include criteria that can be used to evaluate software
security, include criteria to evaluate the security practices of the developers and suppliers
themselves, and identify innovative tools or methods to demonstrate conformance with
secure practices.
(c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of NIST shall publish preliminary
guidelines, based on the consultations described in subsection (b) of this section and
drawing on existing documents as practicable, for enhancing software supply chain security
and meeting the requirements of this section.
(d) Within 360 days of the date of this order, the Director of NIST shall publish additional
guidelines that include procedures for periodic review and updating of the guidelines
described in subsection (c) of this section.
(e) Within 90 days of publication of the preliminary guidelines pursuant to subsection (c)
of this section, the Secretary of Commerce acting through the Director of NIST, in
consultation with the heads of such agencies as the Director of NIST deems appropriate,
shall issue guidance identifying practices that enhance the security of the software supply
chain. Such guidance may incorporate the guidelines published pursuant to subsections (c)
and (i) of this section. Such guidance shall include standards, procedures, or criteria
regarding:
(i) secure software development environments, including such actions as:
(A) using administratively separate build environments;
(B) auditing trust relationships;
(C) establishing multi-factor, risk-based authentication and conditional access
across the enterprise;
(D) documenting and minimizing dependencies on enterprise products that are part
of the environments used to develop, build, and edit software;
(E) employing encryption for data; and
(F) monitoring operations and alerts and responding to attempted and actual cyber
incidents;

7/18

(ii) generating and, when requested by a purchaser, providing artifacts that
demonstrate conformance to the processes set forth in subsection (e)(i) of this section;
(iii) employing automated tools, or comparable processes, to maintain trusted source
code supply chains, thereby ensuring the integrity of the code;

potential vulnerabilities and remediate them, which shall operate regularly, or at a minimum
prior to product, version, or update release;
(v) providing, when requested by a purchaser, artifacts of the execution of the tools
and processes described in subsection (e)(iii) and (iv) of this section, and making publicly
available summary information on completion of these actions, to include a summary
description of the risks assessed and mitigated;
(vi) maintaining accurate and up-to-date data, provenance (i.e., origin) of software
code or components, and controls on internal and third-party software components, tools,
and services present in software development processes, and performing audits and
enforcement of these controls on a recurring basis;
(vii) providing a purchaser a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each product
directly or by publishing it on a public website;
(viii) participating in a vulnerability disclosure program that includes a reporting and
disclosure process;
(ix) attesting to conformity with secure software development practices; and
(x) ensuring and attesting, to the extent practicable, to the integrity and provenance
of open source software used within any portion of a product.

section, the Director of OMB acting through the Administrator of the Office of Electronic
Government within OMB shall take appropriate steps to require that agencies comply with
such guidance.
(k) Within 30 days of issuance of the guidance described in subsection (e) of this section,
the Director of OMB acting through the Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government
within OMB shall take appropriate steps to require that agencies comply with such guidelines
with respect to software procured after the date of this order.
(l) Agencies may request an extension for complying with any requirements issued
pursuant to subsection (k) of this section. Any such request shall be considered by the
Director of OMB on a case-by-case basis, and only if accompanied by a plan for meeting the
underlying requirements. The Director of OMB shall on a quarterly basis provide a report to
the APNSA identifying and explaining all extensions granted.
(m) Agencies may request a waiver as to any requirements issued pursuant to
subsection (k) of this section. Waivers shall be considered by the Director of OMB, in
consultation with the APNSA, on a case-by-case basis, and shall be granted only in
exceptional circumstances and for limited duration, and only if there is an accompanying plan
for mitigating any potential risks.
(n) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in
consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and
the Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government within OMB, shall recommend to the
FAR Council contract language requiring suppliers of software available for purchase by
agencies to comply with, and attest to complying with, any requirements issued pursuant to
subsections (g) through (k) of this section.

FAR Council shall review the recommendations and, as appropriate and consistent with
applicable law, amend the FAR.
(p) Following the issuance of any final rule amending the FAR as described in subsection
(o) of this section, agencies shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, remove
software products that do not meet the requirements of the amended FAR from all indefinite
delivery indefinite quantity contracts; Federal Supply Schedules; Federal Government-wide
Acquisition Contracts; Blanket Purchase Agreements; and Multiple Award Contracts.
(q) The Director of OMB, acting through the Administrator of the Office of Electronic
Government within OMB, shall require agencies employing software developed and
procured prior to the date of this order (legacy software) either to comply with any
requirements issued pursuant to subsection (k) of this section or to provide a plan outlining
actions to remediate or meet those requirements, and shall further require agencies seeking
renewals of software contracts, including legacy software, to comply with any requirements

9/18

issued pursuant to subsection (k) of this section, unless an extension or waiver is granted in
accordance with subsection (l) or (m) of this section.
(r) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce acting through the
Director of NIST, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of
the NSA, shall publish guidelines recommending minimum standards for vendors’ testing of
their software source code, including identifying recommended types of manual or

(k) Unless otherwise directed by the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall
extend the life of the Board every 2 years as the Secretary of Homeland Security deems
appropriate, pursuant to section 871 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.
Sec. 6. Standardizing the Federal Government’s Playbook for Responding to Cybersecurity
Vulnerabilities and Incidents.
(a) The cybersecurity vulnerability and incident response procedures currently used to
identify, remediate, and recover from vulnerabilities and incidents affecting their systems vary
across agencies, hindering the ability of lead agencies to analyze vulnerabilities and
incidents more comprehensively across agencies. Standardized response processes ensure
a more coordinated and centralized cataloging of incidents and tracking of agencies’
progress toward successful responses.
(b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting
through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of OMB, the Federal Chief
Information Officers Council, and the Federal Chief Information Security Council, and in
coordination with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the
Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall develop a standard set of
operational procedures (playbook) to be used in planning and conducting a cybersecurity
vulnerability and incident response activity respecting FCEB Information Systems. The
playbook shall:
(i) incorporate all appropriate NIST standards;
(ii) be used by FCEB Agencies; and
(iii) articulate progress and completion through all phases of an incident response,
12/18

while allowing flexibility so it may be used in support of various response activities.
(c) The Director of OMB shall issue guidance on agency use of the playbook.
(d) Agencies with cybersecurity vulnerability or incident response procedures that deviate
from the playbook may use such procedures only after consulting with the Director of OMB
and the APNSA and demonstrating that these procedures meet or exceed the standards
proposed in the playbook.
(e) The Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of the NSA, shall review and
update the playbook annually, and provide information to the Director of OMB for
incorporation in guidance updates.
(f) To ensure comprehensiveness of incident response activities and build confidence that
unauthorized cyber actors no longer have access to FCEB Information Systems, the
playbook shall establish, consistent with applicable law, a requirement that the Director of
CISA review and validate FCEB Agencies’ incident response and remediation results upon
an agency’s completion of its incident response. The Director of CISA may recommend use
of another agency or a third-party incident response team as appropriate.
(g) To ensure a common understanding of cyber incidents and the cybersecurity status of
an agency, the playbook shall define key terms and use such terms consistently with any
statutory definitions of those terms, to the extent practicable, thereby providing a shared
lexicon among agencies using the playbook.
Sec. 7. Improving Detection of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities and Incidents on Federal
Government Networks.
(a) The Federal Government shall employ all appropriate resources and authorities to
maximize the early detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents on its networks.
This approach shall include increasing the Federal Government’s visibility into and detection
of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats to agency networks in order to bolster the Federal
Government’s cybersecurity efforts.
(b) FCEB Agencies shall deploy an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) initiative to
support proactive detection of cybersecurity incidents within Federal Government
infrastructure, active cyber hunting, containment and remediation, and incident response.
(c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting
through the Director of CISA shall provide to the Director of OMB recommendations on
options for implementing an EDR initiative, centrally located to support host-level visibility,
attribution, and response regarding FCEB Information Systems.
(d) Within 90 days of receiving the recommendations described in subsection (c) of this
section, the Director of OMB, in consultation with Secretary of Homeland Security, shall issue
requirements for FCEB Agencies to adopt Federal Government-wide EDR approaches.
Those requirements shall support a capability of the Secretary of Homeland Secretary,
acting through the Director of CISA, to engage in cyber hunt, detection, and response
activities.
(e) The Director of OMB shall work with the Secretary of Homeland Security and agency
heads to ensure that agencies have adequate resources to comply with the requirements
issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
13/18

(f) Defending FCEB Information Systems requires that the Secretary of Homeland
Security acting through the Director of CISA have access to agency data that are relevant to
a threat and vulnerability analysis, as well as for assessment and threat-hunting purposes.
Within 75 days of the date of this order, agencies shall establish or update Memoranda of
Agreement (MOA) with CISA for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Program to
ensure object level data, as defined in the MOA, are available and accessible to CISA,
consistent with applicable law.
(g) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Director of the NSA as the National
Manager for National Security Systems (National Manager) shall recommend to the
Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Committee on National
Security Systems (CNSS) appropriate actions for improving detection of cyber incidents
affecting National Security Systems, to the extent permitted by applicable law, including
recommendations concerning EDR approaches and whether such measures should be
operated by agencies or through a centralized service of common concern provided by the
National Manager.
(h) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of
National Intelligence, and the CNSS shall review the recommendations submitted under
subsection (g) of this section and, as appropriate, establish policies that effectuate those
recommendations, consistent with applicable law.
(i) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of CISA shall provide to the
Director of OMB and the APNSA a report describing how authorities granted under section
1705 of Public Law 116-283, to conduct threat-hunting activities on FCEB networks without
prior authorization from agencies, are being implemented. This report shall also recommend
procedures to ensure that mission-critical systems are not disrupted, procedures for notifying
system owners of vulnerable government systems, and the range of techniques that can be
used during testing of FCEB Information Systems. The Director of CISA shall provide
quarterly reports to the APNSA and the Director of OMB regarding actions taken under
section 1705 of Public Law 116-283.
(j) To ensure alignment between Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN)
directives and FCEB Information Systems directives, the Secretary of Defense and the
Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Director of OMB, shall:
(i) within 60 days of the date of this order, establish procedures for the Department of
Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to immediately share with each other
Department of Defense Incident Response Orders or Department of Homeland Security
Emergency Directives and Binding Operational Directives applying to their respective
information networks;
(ii) evaluate whether to adopt any guidance contained in an Order or Directive issued
by the other Department, consistent with regulations concerning sharing of classified
information; and
(iii) within 7 days of receiving notice of an Order or Directive issued pursuant to the
procedures established under subsection (j)(i) of this section, notify the APNSA and
Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government within OMB of the evaluation described

14/18

in subsection (j)(ii) of this section, including a determination whether to adopt guidance
issued by the other Department, the rationale for that determination, and a timeline for
application of the directive, if applicable.
Sec. 8. Improving the Federal Government’s Investigative and Remediation Capabilities.
(a) Information from network and system logs on Federal Information Systems (for both
on-premises systems and connections hosted by third parties, such as CSPs) is invaluable
for both investigation and remediation purposes. It is essential that agencies and their IT
service providers collect and maintain such data and, when necessary to address a cyber
incident on FCEB Information Systems, provide them upon request to the Secretary of
Homeland Security through the Director of CISA and to the FBI, consistent with applicable
law.
(b) Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in
consultation with the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Office of Electronic
Government within OMB, shall provide to the Director of OMB recommendations on
requirements for logging events and retaining other relevant data within an agency’s systems
and networks. Such recommendations shall include the types of logs to be maintained, the
time periods to retain the logs and other relevant data, the time periods for agencies to
enable recommended logging and security requirements, and how to protect logs. Logs
shall be protected by cryptographic methods to ensure integrity once collected and
periodically verified against the hashes throughout their retention. Data shall be retained in a
manner consistent with all applicable privacy laws and regulations. Such recommendations
shall also be considered by the FAR Council when promulgating rules pursuant to section 2
of this order.
(c) Within 90 days of receiving the recommendations described in subsection (b) of this
section, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the
Secretary of Homeland Security, shall formulate policies for agencies to establish
requirements for logging, log retention, and log management, which shall ensure centralized
access and visibility for the highest level security operations center of each agency.
(d) The Director of OMB shall work with agency heads to ensure that agencies have
adequate resources to comply with the requirements identified in subsection (c) of this
section.
(e) To address cyber risks or incidents, including potential cyber risks or incidents, the
proposed recommendations issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall include
requirements to ensure that, upon request, agencies provide logs to the Secretary of
Homeland Security through the Director of CISA and to the FBI, consistent with applicable
law. These requirements should be designed to permit agencies to share log information, as
needed and appropriate, with other Federal agencies for cyber risks or incidents.
Sec. 9. National Security Systems.
(a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense acting through the
National Manager, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence and the CNSS,
and in consultation with the APNSA, shall adopt National Security Systems requirements that
15/18

are equivalent to or exceed the cybersecurity requirements set forth in this order that are
otherwise not applicable to National Security Systems. Such requirements may provide for
exceptions in circumstances necessitated by unique mission needs. Such requirements
shall be codified in a National Security Memorandum (NSM). Until such time as that NSM is
issued, programs, standards, or requirements established pursuant to this order shall not
apply with respect to National Security Systems.
(b) Nothing in this order shall alter the authority of the National Manager with respect to
National Security Systems as defined in National Security Directive 42 of July 5, 1990
(National Policy for the Security of National Security Telecommunications and Information
Systems) (NSD-42). The FCEB network shall continue to be within the authority of the
Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA.
Sec. 10. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
(a) the term “agency” has the meaning ascribed to it under 44 U.S.C. 3502.
(b) the term “auditing trust relationship” means an agreed-upon relationship between two
or more system elements that is governed by criteria for secure interaction, behavior, and
outcomes relative to the protection of assets.
(c) the term “cyber incident” has the meaning ascribed to an “incident” under 44 U.S.C.
3552(b)(2).
(d) the term “Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies” or “FCEB Agencies” includes
all agencies except for the Department of Defense and agencies in the Intelligence
Community.
(e) the term “Federal Civilian Executive Branch Information Systems” or “FCEB
Information Systems” means those information systems operated by Federal Civilian
Executive Branch Agencies, but excludes National Security Systems.
(f) the term “Federal Information Systems” means an information system used or
operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or by another organization on behalf
of an agency, including FCEB Information Systems and National Security Systems.
(g) the term “Intelligence Community” or “IC” has the meaning ascribed to it under 50
U.S.C. 3003(4).
(h) the term “National Security Systems” means information systems as defined in 44
U.S.C. 3552(b)(6), 3553(e)(2), and 3553(e)(3).
(i) the term “logs” means records of the events occurring within an organization’s systems
and networks. Logs are composed of log entries, and each entry contains information
related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.
(j) the term “Software Bill of Materials” or “SBOM” means a formal record containing the
details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.
Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling existing open source
and commercial software components. The SBOM enumerates these components in a
product. It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging. An SBOM is useful to
those who develop or manufacture software, those who select or purchase software, and
those who operate software. Developers often use available open source and third-party
software components to create a product; an SBOM allows the builder to make sure those
16/18

components are up to date and to respond quickly to new vulnerabilities. Buyers can use an
SBOM to perform vulnerability or license analysis, both of which can be used to evaluate risk
in a product. Those who operate software can use SBOMs to quickly and easily determine
whether they are at potential risk of a newly discovered vulnerability. A widely used,
machine-readable SBOM format allows for greater benefits through automation and tool
integration. The SBOMs gain greater value when collectively stored in a repository that can
be easily queried by other applications and systems. Understanding the supply chain of
software, obtaining an SBOM, and using it to analyze known vulnerabilities are crucial in
managing risk.
(k) the term “Zero Trust Architecture” means a security model, a set of system design
principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy based on an
acknowledgement that threats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries.
The Zero Trust security model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, node, or service
and instead requires continuous verification of the operational picture via real-time
information from multiple sources to determine access and other system responses. In
essence, a Zero Trust Architecture allows users full access but only to the bare minimum
they need to perform their jobs. If a device is compromised, zero trust can ensure that the
damage is contained. The Zero Trust Architecture security model assumes that a breach is
inevitable or has likely already occurred, so it constantly limits access to only what is needed
and looks for anomalous or malicious activity. Zero Trust Architecture embeds
comprehensive security monitoring; granular risk-based access controls; and system security
automation in a coordinated manner throughout all aspects of the infrastructure in order to
focus on protecting data in real-time within a dynamic threat environment. This data-centric
security model allows the concept of least-privileged access to be applied for every access
decision, where the answers to the questions of who, what, when, where, and how are
critical for appropriately allowing or denying access to resources based on the combination
of sever.
Sec. 11. General Provisions.
(a) Upon the appointment of the National Cyber Director (NCD) and the establishment of
the related Office within the Executive Office of the President, pursuant to section 1752 of
Public Law 116-283, portions of this order may be modified to enable the NCD to fully
execute its duties and responsibilities.
(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head
thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to
budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(c) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.
(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its
departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
17/18

(e) Nothing in this order confers authority to interfere with or to direct a criminal or national
security investigation, arrest, search, seizure, or disruption operation or to alter a legal
restriction that requires an agency to protect information learned in the course of a criminal
or national security investigation.
