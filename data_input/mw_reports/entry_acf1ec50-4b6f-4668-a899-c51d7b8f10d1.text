Below research is reflecting our observations during month of March 2022. We also would like to thank Maria Jose Erquiaga for
her contribution in introduction and support during the process of writing.

Overview
As the Russian-Ukrainian war continues over conventional warfare, cybersecurity professionals witnessed their domain turning
into a real frontier. Threat actors picking sides [1], group members turning against each other [2], some people handing out DDoS
tools [3], some people blending in to turn it into profit [4], and many other stories, proving that this new frontier is changing daily,
and its direct impact is not limited to geographical boundaries.
While attacks seem to be evolving daily, it is challenging for one to stay up to date with all that is going around. Therefore, we
believe that it is important to distinguish between information and actionable intelligence. In Cisco Global Threat Alerts, we would
like to share our observations related to this conflict during March of 2022 and discover how we can turn them into actionable
intelligence together.

Threat Actors in the Russian-Ukrainian Conflict
Since the rapid escalation of the conflict in 2022, security researchers and analysts have been gathering information regarding the
adversarial groups, malware, techniques, and types of attacks implemented [1, 5, 6]. Some of the groups and malware related to
the conflict are described in Table 1:

Gamaredon
1/7

Gamaredon group, also known as Primitive Bear, Shuckworm and ACTINIUM, is an advanced persistent threat (APT) based in
Russia. Their activities can be traced back as early as 2013, prior to Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. They are
known to target state institutions of Ukraine and western government entities located in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials attribute them
to Russian Federal Security Service, also known as FSB [17].
Gamaredon often leverages malicious office files, distributed through spear phishing as the first stage of their attacks. They are
known to use a PowerShell beacon called PowerPunch to download and execute malware for ensuing stages of attacks. Pterodo
and QuietSieve are popular malware families that they deploy for stealing information and various actions on objective [18].
We were able to collect network IoC’s related to Gamaredon infrastructure. During our initial analysis, most of the indicators were
not attributed directly to any specific malware and they were rather listed as part of Gamaredon’s infrastructure. Therefore, we
wanted to analyze their infrastructure to understand their arsenal and deployment in greater detail.

Network Infrastructure
The first part of this research is focused on WHOIS record analysis. We observed that Gamaredon domains were dominantly
registered by REG[.]RU. Creation dates are going back as early as February 2019 and have a changing pattern for the registrant
email. Until August 2020, we observed that message-yandex.ru@mail[.]ru was the main registrant email. Later, it shifted to
macrobit@inbox[.]ru, mixed with the occasional usage of message-yandex.ru@mail[.]ru and tank-bank15@yandex[.]ru. Domain
creation dates in some of the WHOIS records are as recent as March 2022.
Other than WHOIS information, the domains we observed that were related to Gamaredon campaigns had a distinguishing
naming convention. While dataset consisted of domain names (without TLDs) varying between 4 to 16 characters, 70% percent of
them were between 7 to 10 characters. Combined with a limited group of top-level domains (TLDs) used (see Table 2), this leads
us to a naming pattern for further attribution. Additionally, the usage of TLDs on domain creation seems to be rotating.

Table 2: TLD distribution and time in use
In the case of domain resolutions, we aimed to analyze the distribution of autonomous system numbers (ASN) used by resolved
IP addresses (see Table 3). Once more, the owner REG[.]RU is leading the list, owning most of the domains. TimeWeb was the
second this time, with 28% of the domains we found to be related to Gamaredon activities. Domains having ‘. online’ and ‘.ru’
TLDs are regularly updating their IP resolutions, almost daily.

Tooling
After understanding the infrastructure, let’s proceed with their arsenal. We looked at associated file samples for the domains
through Umbrella and Virustotal. A sample of the results can be seen below. Referring to a file type, we can see that the
Gamaredon group prefers malicious office documents with macros. Also, they are known to use Pterodo, which is a constantly
evolving custom backdoor [8, 18].

Table 4: Domains, files (hash and type), and malware name associated to the Gamaredon group
After reviewing the behaviors of the associated malicious samples, it is easier to build attribution between the malicious domain
and the corresponding sample. IP addresses resolved by the domain are later used to establish raw IP command and control (C2)
communication with a distinguishing URL pattern. The following example shows how
1c7804155248e2596ec9de97e5cddcddbafbb5c6d066d972bad051f81bbde5c4 resolves gorigan[.]ru and uses its IP address
to build a C2 URL (http|https<IP>/<random alphanumerical string>). Therefore, DNS and outgoing web traffic is crucial for its
detection.

Detecting Gamaredon Activity with Global Threat Alerts
In Cisco Global Threat Alerts, we are tracking the Gamaredon group under the Gamaredon Activity threat object. The threat
description is enriched with MITRE references (see Figure 3).

Figure 4 shows a detection sample of Gamaredon activity. Observe that the infected device attempted to communicate with the
domains alacritas[.]ru, goloser[.]ru, and libellus[.]ru, which seemed to be sinkholed to the OpenDNS IP address of 146.112.61.

Conclusion
We’ve walked through the steps of producing intelligence from information we’ve collected. We began our analysis with an
unattributed list of network IoC’s and were able to identify unique patterns in their metadata. Then, we pivoted to endpoint IoC’s
and attributed domains to malware families. Next, we showed how we turned it into a detection of the Gamaredon group displayed
in the Cisco Global Threat Alerts portal.
