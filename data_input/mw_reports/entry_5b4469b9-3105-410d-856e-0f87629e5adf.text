We (Did!) Start the Fire: Hacktivists Increasingly Claim
Targeting of OT Systems
mandiant.com/resources/blog/hacktivists-targeting-ot-systems

In January 2023, the Anonymous affiliated hacktivist group, GhostSec, claimed on social
media to have deployed ransomware to encrypt a Belarusian remote terminal unit (RTU)—a
type of operational technology (OT) device for remote monitoring of industrial automation
devices. The actors’ stated intention was to demonstrate support for Ukraine in the ongoing
Russian invasion. Researchers, OT security professionals and media outlets analyzed the
claims and concluded that the actor overstated the implications of the alleged attack.
Although there was no significant impact in this particular incident, the event highlights the
increasing need for a wider discussion regarding the extent of risk hacktivists pose to OT
environments. For the last several years, Mandiant has tracked various hacktivists' claims of
targeting OT systems claiming physical damage as a result. Exacerbated by geopolitical

1/11

tensions in different regions—such as Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine—these actors
have recently intensified their activity, resulting in more frequent claims and new avenues to
impact targets.
In most cases, hacktivists’ claims are exaggerated or unsubstantiated. The number of false
claims is at times challenging to debunk. However, despite the inaccuracy of most claims,
when hacktivist activity targeting OT becomes commonplace, the likelihood of actual and
even substantial OT incidents increases. The risk is higher for organizations that are
perceptibly associated with political events or social disputes based on geographic location,
nationality, language, or industry of relevance.
In this blog post, Mandiant offers a comprehensive analysis of recent hacktivist activity
targeting OT systems. Mandiant was able to leverage information from previously
undisclosed and known incidents to discuss the potential implications for OT defenders.
Awareness about emerging hacktivism trends helps OT defenders to prioritize
countermeasures and differentiate state-sponsored fronts leveraging the hacktivism cloak.

Hacktivists Increasingly Claim to Target and Impact OT
In 2021, Mandiant published a blog post describing an increasing trend in low sophistication
compromises where actors targeted internet-exposed assets across multiple industries. Most
of the cases we analyzed were seemingly conducted for financial or opportunistic
motivations. But others were conducted with ideological motivations by hacktivist groups
claiming to target OT devices or releasing training tutorials to inform other actors how to
attack OT systems.
One year later in 2022, Mandiant observed more than twice as many hacktivist claims
targeting OT as compared to 2021. The majority of cases Mandiant tracked in 2022 were
conducted by actors in support of Ukraine—although we also observed instances in favor of
Russia. Additionally, Mandiant noted an interesting trend where hacktivist actors focused
their targeting on organizations in the Middle East, likely in response to political tensions in
the region. Figure 1 illustrates some relevant keywords we observed across different
hacktivist claims.

While in most cases, Mandiant was not able to fully validate the actors’ claims, we assess
with moderate confidence that hacktivist actors have more often than not, overstated the
effects and impact of their attacks. In other cases, it is possible hacktivists provided
questionable claims about their independence or non-affiliation with government-sponsored
groups.
Nevertheless, in the majority of the cases, the actors provided evidence of at least being
proficient in accessing unidentified internet-exposed OT assets. It is important to note that
there are also multiple other cases, wherein the actors targeted IT assets from OT
organizations, however for the purpose of this analysis, we are not including those instances.

Trends in Hacktivist Activity Targeting OT
Throughout 2022, the majority of hacktivist claims that Mandiant observed targeting OT
followed similar techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs) and behavioral patterns. The
actors often leveraged similar social media and messaging channels and targeted victims in
the same way.
Most often, the hacktivists likely gained initial access via insecure, internet accessible
devices or public-facing applications. This allowed them to execute actions via commandline, or graphical user interfaces (See the Appendix for a list of MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
tactics and techniques used by hacktivists targeting OT). While these types of techniques
have historically been used to conduct low sophistication OT compromises, we recently
observed some unique trends that indicate changes from baseline activity.

Hacktivists Increasingly Use Public Forums and Social Media Platforms to
Post Claims
3/11

Historically, hacktivist claims of compromising OT systems were distributed exclusively
across closed audiences via underground forums or private communication channels.
However, recent claims have also been promoted via dedicated assets affiliated with the
actors on public forums and popular social media platforms. These methods help the actors
to gain public attention via media and specialized publications, enabling them to leverage
claimed OT compromises to grow their reputations, gain notoriety, and spread their promoted
messaging across broader audiences. A negative effect of this trend is that the amplification
of such activity can also inspire other actors to build offensive OT-oriented capabilities.

Hacktivists Support Both International and Domestic Political Narratives
Most recent OT-oriented hacktivist activity was allegedly conducted in response to
geopolitical events—with the vast majority of that activity targeting Russia as a result of its
invasion in Ukraine, as well as targeting Israeli regional policies. These hacktivists often
depicted their OT-oriented operations as contributing to militias fighting on behalf of Ukraine
or Palestine.
The most active group we tracked in 2022 was Team OneFist (also known as Joint Cyber
Center). Team OneFist issued multiple claims via social media, alleging to conduct attacks
against power plants, an airport, uninterruptible power supply (UPS systems), a paper mill,
and SCADA systems, among others. The actor’s promoted narrative suggests the group’s
main motivation is to target Russian organizations in support of Ukraine.

paper mill
Although most messaging associated with hacktivist claims appeared responsive to
geopolitical developments, we observed at least one case where the actor opposed domestic
policies in the United States. In July 2022, the threat actor "SiegedSec" targeted U.S.-based

4/11

IP addresses with exposed ICS ports to protest abortion restrictions in the United States. The
attack was part of a broader Anonymous-related hacktivism campaign known as Operation
Jane (aka #OpJane).

Some Hacktivists Leverage Known OT Exploits to Target Victims Assets
Recently, we have observed hacktivist groups leveraging specialized exploits and exploit
modules to increase the likelihood of impacting OT devices. Such evolution in hacktivist
techniques results both from the existence of an active community sharing knowledge, and
the increasing availability of resources shared publicly to interact with OT.
For example, in June and July 2022, actors "GhostSec" and "SiegedSec" targeted OT assets
in the U.S., Israel, and Russia using OT-oriented exploit modules. The actors leveraged an
IEC-104 and EtherNet-IP CIP Metasploit modules, and a custom Modbus-based tool dubbed
"Killbus" (Figure 3).

Figure 3: EtherNet/IP CIP Metasploit module commands executed by hacktivists
In other cases, actors exploited known vulnerabilities to reach their target. For example, in
June 2022, pro-Ukraine threat actor Team OneFist targeted a cellular router allegedly
supporting OT in Russia by exploiting a known cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability in the system that leads to remote code execution.

5/11

Between April and July 2022, multiple hacktivist groups targeted ELNet OT assets in Israel,
possibly by exploiting a missing authentication vulnerability reported in the assets' web
consoles. We have not identified evidence indicating formal collaboration between these
actors, but it is possible that mutual awareness of each other’s activity prompted interest in
reusing similar vulnerabilities to target their victims.

Hacktivists Share Documentation of Physical Incidents to Gain Credibility
In most of the hacktivist claims we tracked, the actors leveraged documentation, such as
videos or screenshots, to provide evidence of their actions and gain credibility. Often, the
actors shared images of real physical incidents to claim responsibility for the destruction of
assets – even if they were not caused by their attacks. This is likely a strategy used by actors
to help bring attention to their political and social messaging.
For example, in July 2022, Iraqi group Altahrea Team claimed it was responsible for a fire at
the Orot Yosef power plant in the Negev in southern Israel. The actor shared a video of the
fire to illustrate their claim (Figure 4). A couple days later, GhostSec shared a video of a
physical incident at a hydro-power plant in Russia and claimed credit for the incident. The
actor noted their recent activity targeting internet-accessible electricity assets in Russia as
proof of their claims. In both cases, we found no evidence connecting the hacktivist actions
to the physical incidents.

In June 2022, Team OneFist claimed to have disabled a cellular router supporting OT in
Russia. The actor took advantage of a publicly reported physical incident at a nearby power
plant and claimed that it was the result of their operation. However, the primary cause of the
outage was reportedly a fire at a different power plant situated nearly 400 miles away.
This trend illustrates a common challenge for OT security professionals, which is the limited
understanding of the field outside of specialized industry cliques and the lengthy process
required to conduct root-cause analysis. As we observe an increasing number of claims from
actors taking responsibility for physical damage, OT defenders require more resources to
filter what information is relevant. Additionally, other information operations actors could
potentially leverage such claims to further their own objectives in targeting a given
population.

Some Actors Emphasize Intent to Avoid Impacts to or Endanger Human
Safety
Some hacktivist actors have also claimed to avoid impacts to human safety. However, there
is no evidence to verify their intentions. It is plausible that the hacktivists emphasized safety
either because of the perception of OT-oriented attacks as potentially harmful or simply to
improve their reputation and gain sympathy from their audiences.
One example was the case of GhostSec in July 2022, which claimed to cause an incident at
a power plant in Russia. The actor then claimed the attack was "executed with 0 casualties in
the actual explosion due to our proper timing while performing our attacks" (Figure 5).

their alleged cyber-physical attack avoided human casualties
Another example is the self-proclaimed hacktivist Predatory Sparrow–also known as
UNC4368–which in June 2022, claimed to conduct cyber attacks against three steel
manufacturers in Iran, alleging it destroyed physical infrastructure. The actor shared a video
showing an explosion in a manufacturing facility and emphasized the attack was carried out
carefully to protect innocent individuals. We note that the techniques used by Predatory
Sparrow in prior incidents are more complex than those from other hacktivists. This may
indicate collaboration or sponsorship from sophisticated actors.

attack
While less common, we have also observed self-proclaimed hacktivists claiming direct intent
to endanger human safety. On Jan. 29, 2023, Arabic-speaking hacktivist group `Force
Electronic Quds` (FEQ) claimed several attacks against OT in Israel. In a post from one of
those attacks, the actor shared screenshots from systems that allegedly belonged to
chemical facilities. The post threatened the company’s employees and stated they “will never
hesitate to melt your bodies with chemicals”.

Hacktivists Target OT to Make Political Statements
Hacktivism leverages cyber threat activity as a means to convey political or social narratives.
As such, any attempts to inflict damage on a victim may only be a means to this end or one
of multiple objectives. Historical hacktivist activity has largely focused on simpler attacks that
are intended to get the attention of broad audiences, such as website compromises or denial
of service attacks. The shift in hacktivist activity to also target OT can be explained by
multiple factors:
Attacks against OT systems are often perceived as impactful, given their potential to
damage or modify physical processes. Prioritizing higher-profile targets increases the
likelihood that an actor will attract the public’s attention even if they do not damage OT
systems or if their compromise results in trivial impacts. Similarly to information
operations campaigns, these types of hacktivist claims can also serve to undermine the
public’s trust in governments and organizations.

9/11

In some cases, targeting OT systems enables actors to participate and offer support for
a cause from distant locations, such as during armed conflicts. This is illustrated by
self-proclaimed hacktivist groups that currently conduct cyber operations in opposition
or in favor of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Self-proclaimed hacktivist cyber operations have also been used in the past to conceal
state-sponsored activity and provide nation-states with plausible deniability—enabling
states to conduct attacks with a lower risk of repercussions. An example is XakNet
Team, which Mandiant has assessed with moderate confidence to be operating in
coordination with APT28 actors. Given that hacktivist claims are often difficult to verify,
nation-states can also use them to conduct false-flag operations.
Some hacktivist actors have likely been inspired by prior cyber threat activity related to
both low sophistication compromises and high-impact OT-oriented threat activity.

Situational Awareness to Prevent Hacktivist Compromises
In 2022, Mandiant observed a significant increase in the number of instances where
hacktivists claimed to target OT. While we observed activity across different regions, most of
these cases were conducted by actors that have mobilized surrounding the Russian invasion
of Ukraine. The implication of this is that the increase in hacktivism activity targeting OT may
not necessarily become consistent over time. However, it does illustrate that during political,
military, or social events, OT defenders face a heightened risk.
These risks are also exacerbated by the quick evolution of hacktivist actors that have
experimented with new tools and exploits during the war in Ukraine. The information and
knowledge about OT compromises, which has been produced and shared during the last
year, will likely help reduce the learning curve for different actors interested in targeting OT.
This may increase the complexity of low sophistication compromises even after the end of
the war. It is also possible that other more sophisticated actors will copy hacktivist techniques
to limit the risk of facing consequences when targeting OT, or to support other types of
information operations.
Asset owners and operators should maintain situational awareness of trends in hacktivist
threat activity targeting OT systems to anticipate potential risks. We also highlight that most
often, hacktivist threat activity can be prevented following common best practices for remote
access to critical and internet-accessible systems.
