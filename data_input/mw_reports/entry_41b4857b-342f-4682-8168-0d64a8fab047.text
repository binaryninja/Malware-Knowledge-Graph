After almost a year and a half, the operators behind the GandCrab Ransomware are
shutting down their operation and affiliates are being told to stop distributing the
ransomware.
Filling the gaps left behind by the shutdown of large scale ransomware operations such as
TeslaCrypt, CryptoWall, and Spora, GandCrab exploded into the ransomware world on
January 28th, 2018, when they started marketing their services on underground criminal
sites.
Since then, they had become one of the dominant, if not the most dominant, actors in
ransomware operations, with their operations only starting to slow down over the past few
months.
According to security researchers Damian and David Montenegro who have been following
the exploits of GandCrab on the underground hacking and malware forum Exploit.in, the
GandCrab operators have posted that they are shutting down their operation.

In images provided to BleepingComputer by Damian, we can see the operators stating that
they have generated more than $2 billion in ransom payments, with average weekly
payments of $2.5 million dollars. They go on to say they have personally earned $150
million, which they have cashed out and invested in legal business entities.

GandCrab Ransomware
With this announcement GandCrab has said they have stopped promoting the ransomware,
asked the affiliates to stop distributing the ransomware within 20 days, and asked their topic
to be deleted at the end of the month.

They have also told victims to pay for needed decryption now as their keys will be deleted
at the end of the month. This is could be a last money grab and we hope that the GandCrab
devs will follow other large ransomware operations and release the keys when shutting

down.
BleepingComputer has reached out to the developers and asked them to do so.
Historically, BleepingComputer has seen large-scale ransomware operations fill the void left
when another ransomware shuts down. It would not be surprising to see another operation
spring up in the near future, especially when as noted by GandCrab:
"We have proven that by doing evil deeds, retribution does not come."

Lofty claims of earnings
While the operators behind GandCrab most likely made many millions of dollars, the claims
of $2 billion in ransom payments are very likely to be untrue.
These lofty claims are not surprising, as the developers of GrandCrab have always been
jokesters and have engaged security researchers in ways most malware developers do
not.
Using taunts, jokes, and references to organizations and researchers in their code, it was
obvious that the GandCrab developers were monitoring us as much as we were monitoring
them and got a big kick out of it.
For example, in their first release of the ransomware, GandCrab decided to use domain
names for their Command & Control servers that are based on organizations and sites
known for ransomware research. For example, you can bleepingcomputer, nomoreransom,
eset, and emsisoft listed below in their initial C2 servers.
bleepingcomputer.bit
nomoreransom.bit
esetnod32.bit
emsisoft.bit
gandcrab.bit

They also frequently dropped hellos to researchers who analyzed their ransomware.

It was not all fun and games, though, for the GandCrab operators also had a vindictive
streak. After AhnLab released a vaccine app for GandCrab, the ransomware developers
contacted BleepingComputer to tell us that they were releasing a zero-day for the AhnLab
v3 Lite antivirus.

Their antics and success didn't go unnoticed by other members of Exploit.in who wished
them farewell or were saddened to see them leave.

While the GandCrab antics have been amusing at times, they ultimately inflicted a lot of
pain and suffering on many people who lost their data, work, and potentially even
businesses. Their shutdown of operations is a good thing.

Karma has a way of catching up to people and I think these guys will get more bad
karma than they can handle.
