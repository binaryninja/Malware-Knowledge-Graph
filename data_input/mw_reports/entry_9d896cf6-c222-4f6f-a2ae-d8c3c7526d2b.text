UNC788: IRAN’S DECADE OF CREDENTIAL HARVESTING... HAEGHEBAERT

ABSTRACT
Driven by the authoritarian’s desire for regime survival, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of
Intelligence (MOIS) have long conducted extensive domestic surveillance and espionage operations against the country’s
domestic populace and foreign targets of strategic intelligence value. This paper analyses and dissects UNC788’s most
recent domestic surveillance operation with a malicious Android application dubbed PINEFLOWER. Our analysis
confirmed that the actors exfiltrated recorded phone calls, room audio recordings, pictures and entire SMS inboxes along
with relevant metadata from devices which appeared to belong to individuals residing in Iran. At least one device belonged
to an individual who appears to be engaged in social activism in Iran. This activity confirms long-standing suspicions that
UNC788 conducts domestically focused operations as part of its mandate to conduct cyber espionage and credential
harvesting operations in support of Iranian strategic priorities.
The results presented in this paper are based on threat intelligence, collection and reverse engineering of threat actor tools,
and analysis of their malicious infrastructure. This paper will focus on my experience and analytical process uncovering
this operation by stepping through the initial discovery of the malicious infrastructure, discussing the various tools used to
pivot to additional actor resources and to facilitate victim data analysis, and by exploring the evidence underpinning our
attribution assessment.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2020, FireEye published a blog post [1] detailing its use of ‘UNC’ groups – or ‘uncategorized’ groups – as
a way of clustering and keeping track of threat activity clusters that are not yet eligible to be classified as APT or FIN
groups. As the blog notes, UNCs are created around a defining, anchoring characteristic of threat activity and, ‘as we
discover new artifacts associated with other incidents and proactive collections efforts, the UNC provides a framework
to join discrete pieces of evidence together.’ UNCs include observables such as adversary infrastructure, tools and
tradecraft, and can grow, merge with, or break off from other clusters as more data becomes available over time. The
blog provides several case studies.
FireEye analysts created UNC788 in May 2017 to track a large group of credential-harvesting domains. Over time, we
created new UNCs that we suspected, but at the time could not prove, were part of the same sustained credential-harvesting
effort defined by UNC788. As of early 2021, however, we have merged seven clusters with UNC788, resulting in a large
activity that we believe first became operational in 2012. The group remains highly active.
It is inherent in any threat intelligence capability that clustering of activity does not map 1:1 in all cases to those of other
researchers, vendors or organizations. As a result we have a complex adversary- and malware-naming environment, where
multiple names can refer to either the same activity, elements thereof, or simply a related operation. The threat activity we
track as UNC788, however, largely corresponds to activity others track as TA453 (Proofpoint), Phosphorus (Microsoft) and
Charming Kitten (ClearSky Cyber Security, Certfa Lab).

LITERATURE REVIEW
UNC788 operations have been well documented over the past several years. One of the first public reports on the group
dates to June 2015, when ClearSky Cyber Security (‘ClearSky’) published its report on ‘Thamar Reservoir’ [2], an
operation targeting approximately 500 individuals active in academia, security and defence, journalism, and human rights
activism in the Middle East. ClearSky further suggested that the campaign may have begun in mid-2014. A 2017 ClearSky
report then named Charming Kitten as an Iranian cyber espionage group pursuing access to private email and Facebook
accounts as opposed to compromising larger organizations, linking the Thamar Reservoir activity to Charming Kitten [3].
Two years later, ClearSky reported that it had observed Charming Kitten targeting academic researchers and influential
public figures around the world. To do so, the group used spear phishing messages impersonating researchers or journalists
inviting the victim to an event or encouraging the target to review their resume [4].
This type of activity is consistent with Microsoft’s reporting on ‘Phosphorus’ in October 2019, when the company stated
its security researchers had observed Phosphorus, which they linked to the Iranian government, targeting accounts
‘associated with a US presidential campaign, current and former US government officials, journalists covering global
politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran’ [5]. Microsoft noted that the group, while not technically
sophisticated, appeared highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources in its operations. This
report came on the heels of Microsoft’s filing of an official complaint in March 2019, alleging the defendants had
established an Internet-based cyber-theft operation referred to as Phosphorus, which allowed the company to seize 99
domains used by the group [6].
In a follow-on report in October 2019, ClearSky researchers subsequently wrote that they assessed with a medium to high
level of confidence that the aforementioned Microsoft blog and ClearSky’s reporting were indeed tracking the same activity
[7]. In this report, they further detailed Charming Kitten’s most recent attack vectors, including spear phishing,
impersonating social media websites and using these platforms to distribute malicious links, and sending SMS messages
directly to a target’s cellular device.

The group remained highly active during 2020, with numerous news articles discussing UNC788’s persistent operations
against high-level individuals, journalists, conference attendees, and political and human rights activists. In January 2020,
Certfa Lab (‘Certfa’) published a report detailing its investigation of phishing campaigns with the apparent objective to
steal email account data and information on the victim’s contacts. The group used fake interview invitations, and in one
case impersonated a known New York Times reporter, to entice the target to log into, for example, a fake Google page.
Similar to the activity described in previous reporting, this time Charming Kitten went after government institutions, think
tanks, and academics institutions, but also organizations with ties to the Baha’i faith [8]. Additional campaigns in 2020
targeted attendees at the Munich Security Conference [9] and an Iran analyst at the Atlantic Council [10]. Notably, in
mid-2020, researchers at IBM X-Force retrieved from an open directory server what appeared to be ‘training demonstrations
the Iran-backed hackers made to show junior team members how to handle hacked accounts’ [11]. This discovery appears
to corroborate Microsoft’s perception that the group is not particularly adept at operational security.
In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a noticeable shift in the group’s targeting patterns occurred. For the first
time, UNC788 started pursuing public health, medical technology, and pharmaceutical information. According to
Reuters, the actor started conducting credential harvesting operations against the personal email accounts of staff at the
World Health Organization [12]. In May 2020, open sources reported that the group targeted Gilead, a US drugmaker at
the time working on treatments for COVID-19 [13]. Interestingly, the group appeared interested in medical research
beyond treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. Most recently, in March 2021, Proofpoint reported that TA453 had
‘launched a credential phishing campaign targeting senior medical professionals who specialize in genetic, neurology
and oncology research in the United States and Israel’ [14]. Iran suffers from rampant shortages of medical equipment,
supplies, and drugs, including for cancer treatments [15], despite US economic sanctions explicitly not applying to
medical devices or medicine. These types of operations may indicate renewed efforts by the regime to try to offset
these challenges.
Note: The threat activity cluster Mandiant tracks as UNC788 generally corresponds with the activity ClearSky and Certfa
have reported on as Charming Kitten, that Microsoft tracks as Phosphorus, and that Proofpoint calls TA453. However, public
reporting frequently describes this actor as ‘also known as APT35’. Mandiant tracks APT35 as distinct from UNC788.

UNC788 DEFINED
UNC788 is a cluster of threat activity Mandiant suspects conducts cyber espionage operations on behalf of the Iranian
government. The group is characterized by credential theft operations against corporate and personal email accounts and
has consistently targeted Western think tanks and academics, current and former government officials, members of the
Iranian diaspora in the United Kingdom, Israel, and the United States, as well as high-profile individuals within Iran. In
2020, we also observed UNC788 targeting employees of pharmaceutical companies in the United States and the United
Kingdom, in line with public reporting, in a likely effort to obtain medical information in support of the COVID-19
response. This suggests the group may alter its operational focus as Iran’s strategic priorities evolve over time. UNC788 has
been operational since at least 2012 and likely evolved from the participants of Iranian hacktivist forums.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS) have long conducted extensive
domestic surveillance and espionage operations against its domestic populace and foreign targets of strategic
intelligence value.
In March 2021, we uncovered a widespread domestic surveillance operation using a malicious Android application
dubbed PINEFLOWER. We detected the campaign during our routine monitoring for UNC788 infrastructure procurement.
The next several sections of this paper will discuss our discovery of this operation and our analysis of the PINEFLOWER
malware.

INFRASTRUCTURE: INITIAL DISCOVERY
During routine monitoring for newly procured infrastructure configured in a manner consistent with UNC788’s domain
registration pattern, we identified the domain ‘display-monitor[.]site’ resolving to the IP addresses 198[.]23[.]213[.]155 and
198[.]23[.]213[.]157, where it still resolves at the time of writing and is likely parked. Also resolving to the former IP
address a few weeks prior was the domain ‘account-inbox[.]com’ (see Table 1).

The DNS Start of Authority (SOA) entry for ‘account-inbox.com’ was set to ‘nami.rosoki@gmail.com’, an email address
we have historically observed UNC788 use to register malicious infrastructure. One of these malicious domains,
‘youtubee-videos.com’, was registered in July 2017 and mimicked the Telegram login page in an attempt to steal user
credentials, as detailed in this 2018 Cisco Talos blog [16]. The re-use of this email address for domain registration is also
indicative of the actor’s relatively low regard for operational security.

Figure 1: Domain registration email for ‘account-inbox[.]com’ on DomainTools.

INFRASTRUCTURE: PIVOTING
The domain ‘display-monitor[.]site’ hosted content impersonating a legitimate flower shop based in North Carolina in the
United States. A scan of the domain available on VirusTotal also shows that links to the legitimate company’s social media
pages were hosted on this site, suggesting the actors had scraped the flower shop’s website in an attempt to make the
domain appear benign.
Pivoting on the URLs in VirusTotal leads to another suspicious domain, ‘developer-app[.]xyz’, which also matched
UNC788’s domain registration patterns. The actors hosted the same scraped flower shop content on this domain, according
to a screenshot saved by DomainTools.
VirusTotal showed a file that communicated with this domain, named ‘WhatsApp.apk’ (Figure 2). Considering the
proximity in space of ‘display-monitor[.]site’ to ‘developer-app[.]xyz’, which served as a C&C server for this newly
identified APK, we hypothesize that this implant may be operated by the same actor. Having observed the scraped flower
shop content on the two malicious domains, we chose to dub the Android malware family PINEFLOWER.

Figure 2: ‘WhatsApp.apk’ listed as a communicating file to ‘developer-app[.]xyz’.
The APK file appeared to have two DEX files bundled within it (Figure 3).

Figure 3: WhatsApp.apk bundled files.
The strings of the ‘assets/classes.dex’ file show the string ‘.data_gsc98647a3’, which appeared to be relatively unique
(Figure 4).

Figure 4: ‘assets/classes.dex’ strings.
A second DEX file contained this unique string, suggesting they may be related, even though this second sample was
submitted to VirusTotal in January 2018. The parent APK file appeared to be spoofing Google Services, using
‘GoogleServices’ as the subject and issuer of the certificate, and using the Google Services icon.

Table 2: PINEFLOWER samples.
The C&C server ‘hardship-management[.]com’ had been mentioned in a public blog called Iran Cyber News and an article
titled ‘CORRUPT KITTEN Exposed’ [17]. CORRUPT KITTEN was the author’s chosen name for an Android implant that,
according to the blog, ‘supports a full range of spying and device management capability’. The blog contained a summary
analysis of this CORRUPT KITTEN implant and an MD5 hash for a DEX file allegedly using the same C&C server.
Notably, the author also noted that the malware stored files ready for exfiltration in a directory named ‘.data_gsc98647a3’,
the string we identified in our PINEFLOWER samples. It seemed likely that CORRUPT KITTEN and PINEFLOWER
were one and the same.
Finally, by pivoting on the known infrastructure, we identified additional domains that may be related to UNC788 activity.
Notably, the C&C server 91[.]134[.]244[.]133 shared an SSL certificate with the IP address 79[.]137[.]3[.]102, which also
hosted both ‘developer-app[.]xyz’ and ‘inbox-account[.]info’. In turn, the IP 91[.]121[.]217[.]34 had also hosted
‘secure-team[.]xyz’ and ‘device-monitor[.]xyz’ (see Table 2). While this infrastructure is suspicious and roughly matches
UNC788’s domain registration pattern, we were unable to definitively attribute the domains to the group at the time this
report was written.

Figure 5 provides a visual overview of our discovery and pivots, including the activity surrounding the Android implant we
dubbed PINEFLOWER, the suspected related activity, and the links to historical activity.

PINEFLOWER: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
In this section, I describe the technical analysis we conducted on PINEFLOWER. We used a variety of tools including the
MobSF Framework [18], an Android emulator built into Android Studio, and jadx GUI [19] for code analysis. While our
initial analysis was done statically, followed by running PINEFLOWER in an emulator and MobSF, we have combined our
findings here to describe the execution pattern of the malware. Of the two samples available for analysis, we focused on the
sample most recently submitted to VirusTotal, ‘WhatsApp.apk’.

Initial execution
Using the emulator built into Android Studio, we ran the ‘WhatsApp.apk’ sample on several devices to observe its
behaviour. Upon installation of the PINEFLOWER malware, the malicious application masquerades as WhatsApp before
hiding itself and running in the background. On devices running Android 11, the user is prompted to accept various
permissions and the application remains visible from the main menu (Figure 6).

On older devices, the user is not prompted to accept permissions. Instead, once the application is installed, it is hidden from
the main menu while it continues running in the background (Figure 7).

Once the malware has successfully been installed on the device, it sends an initial beacon to the command-and-control
server. PINEFLOWER first reads the decimal-encoded C&C hard coded in the malware (Figure 8). The array decodes to
http://developer-app.xyz/.

(SHA256: c2c1d804aeed1913f858df48bf89a58b1f9819d7276a70b50785cf91c9d34083).
The beacon, sent to the C&C via an HTTP POST request, contains a SHA-1 value of the hard-coded AES key, device, and
network information:

After this initial beacon, PINEFLOWER waits for commands from the C&C server and uses a local SQLite database to
store queued commands as well as results of tasks run by these commands. When the malware successfully executes one of
its modules following a command from its C&C, it adds a new entry to the SQL database. The final SQLite database can be
uploaded to the C&C server (Figure 10).

Figure 10: PINEFLOWER reading SQLite into an ArrayList for uploading to the C&C.

Supported commands
PINEFLOWER can receive and support a wide range of commands from the C&C server. Some notable commands,
including ‘calls_recorder’, ‘sound_recorder’, ‘sms_inbox’ and ‘picture_take’, suggest the malware is capable of recording
calls, triggering sound recordings, taking pictures using the compromised device’s camera, and exfiltrating SMS inboxes.
Table 5 shows the supported commands and the first 16 characters of the corresponding SHA-1 value, which the malware
then uses to name files for exfiltration.

Staging & exfiltration
Files ready for exfiltration are stored in a directory that is hard coded into the malware:
• Android/.data_gsc98647a3
When PINEFLOWER writes the files to this folder, it generates a unique filename in the following format:
• <first 16 characters of command name SHA-1 value>_<first 21 characters of a random UUID, dashes removed>.<Unix
timestamp>.complete.d
For example, for the file ‘c2cc53c99fb858a9_871388f9f5f14c178246e.1606985941.complete.d’:
• ‘c2cc53c99fb858a9’ are the first 16 characters of the SHA-1 value for ‘sound_recorder’, which is
c2cc53c99fb858a9c6c836d0f48c874b1d78d00b.
• ‘871388f9f5f14c178246e’ is the result of a randomly generated UUID with the dashes removed.
• ‘1606985941’ is a Unix timestamp that converts to ‘12/3/2020 03:55:35’.

Figure 11: Filename generation methods.
PINEFLOWER uses a compression and encryption routine to obfuscate the files prior to exfiltration. Similar to the
hard-coded C&C, the encryption key and IV for the AES-128-CBC encryption are stored in a decimal-encoded byte array
(Figure 12).

Figure 12: Encryption key and IV hard coded into decimal-encoded byte arrays.
PINEFLOWER first compresses the data via GZIP, and then passes the key and IV as parameters to a function that encrypts
the data using AES-128-CBC (Figure 13).

Figure 13: Compression with GZIP and encryption using AEC-128-CBC.
Finally, for each exfiltrated file, the malware appends a Base64-encoded JSON object containing the name of the original
command, a Unix timestamp, and a Boolean ‘data’ field to the file data. The following is an example of such
Base64-encoded string that would be appended to an audio file:
• eyJuYW1lIjoic291bmRfcmVjb3JkZXIiLCJkYXRlIjoxNjA2OTg3NjQwMTczLCJkYXRhIjoiZmFsc2UifQ
Base64 decoded, this string is:
• {“name”:“sound_recorder”,“date”:1606987640173,“data”:“false”}
Our analysis showed that PINEFLOWER would not use the compression and encryption routine on every file it prepares
for exfiltration. Rather, some files are simply saved in the .complete.d format and have the Base64-encoded string, as
shown above, appended to the content. It is therefore likely that these files could simply be saved with the correct file
extension or opened with appropriate software.
The only differences we observed between the two samples of PINEFLOWER are in the hard-coded key and IV
combinations for the encryption routine and the C&C servers. While the Iran Cyber News blog listed an MD5 hash value
for a third sample we were unable to retrieve, the blog’s description of the implant matched our analysis of PINEFLOWER.

UNC788: IRAN’S DECADE OF CREDENTIAL HARVESTING... HAEGHEBAERT

PINEFLOWER SUSPECTED TARGETING
As discussed in the literature review section, UNC788 has long targeted members of the Iranian diaspora, dissidents, and
other individuals of interest to the Iranian regime. This campaign is no exception. Our analysis confirmed that the actors
exfiltrated recorded phone calls, room audio recordings, pictures, and entire SMS inboxes along with relevant metadata
from devices which appeared to belong to individuals residing in Iran. At least one device belonged to an individual who
appears to be engaged in social activism in Iran. This activity confirms long-standing suspicions that UNC788 conducts
domestically focused operations as part of their ostensible mandate to conduct cyber espionage and credential harvesting
operations in support of Iranian strategic priorities.

CONCLUSION
The use of Android malware to target individuals of interest to the Iranian government provides UNC788 with a productive
method of obtaining sensitive information on their targets, including movement, contacts of interest, and personal
information. The malware’s ability to record phone calls, activate the microphone and record the audio, exfiltrate images
and take pictures on command, read SMS messages, and track the victim’s GPS location in real time poses a real-world risk
to the individual victims of this campaign.
While UNC788 carries out frequent credential-harvesting operations using pages spoofing login portals to services like
Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook Web Access, we have confirmed that a subset of its operations also targets mobile device users.
The group clearly has access to an expansive toolset, so we deem it likely that they have additional mobile malware tools at
their disposal, and that the PINEFLOWER samples we observed are but a few of many.
