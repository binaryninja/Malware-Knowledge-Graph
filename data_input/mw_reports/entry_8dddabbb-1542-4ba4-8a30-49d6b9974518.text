Introduction
Kaspersky Lab has always worked closely with vendors to protect users.
As soon as we ﬁnd new vulnerabilities we immediately inform the vendor
in a responsible manner and provide all the details required for a ﬁx.
On October 10, 2017, Kaspersky Lab’s advanced exploit prevention
systems identiﬁed a new Adobe Flash zero day exploit used in the wild
against our customers. The exploit was delivered through a Microsoft
Oﬃce document and the ﬁnal payload was the latest version of FinSpy
malware. We have reported the bug to Adobe who assigned it CVE-201711292 and released a patch earlier today:

So far only one attack has been observed in our customer base, leading us
to believe the number of attacks are minimal and highly targeted.
Analysis of the payload allowed us to conﬁdently link this attack to an
actor we track as “BlackOasis”. We are also highly conﬁdent that
BlackOasis was also responsible for another zero day exploit (CVE-20178759) discovered by FireEye in September 2017. The FinSpy payload used
in the current attacks (CVE-2017-11292) shares the same command and
control (C2) server as the payload used with CVE-2017-8759 uncovered
by FireEye.

BlackOasis Background
We ﬁrst became aware of BlackOasis’ activities in May 2016, while
investigating another Adobe Flash zero day. On May 10, 2016, Adobe
warned of a vulnerability (CVE-2016-4117) aﬀecting Flash Player
21.0.0.226 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and
Chrome OS. The vulnerability was actively being exploited in the wild.
Kaspersky Lab was able to identify a sample exploiting this vulnerability
that was uploaded to a multi scanner system on May 8, 2016. The sample,
in the form of an RTF document, exploited CVE-2016-4117 to download
and install a program from a remote C&C server. Although the exact
payload of the attack was no longer in the C&C, the same server was
hosting multiple FinSpy installation packages.
Leveraging data from Kaspersky Security Network, we identiﬁed two
other similar exploit chains used by BlackOasis in June 2015 which were
zero days at the time. Those include CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-20160984, which were patched in July 2015 and February 2016 respectively.
These exploit chains also delivered FinSpy installation packages.
Since the discovery of BlackOasis’ exploitation network, we’ve been
tracking this threat actor with the purpose of better understanding their
operations and targeting and have seen a couple dozen new attacks.
Some lure documents used in these attacks are shown below:

Decoy documents used in BlackOasis attacks
To summarize, we have seen BlackOasis utilizing at least ﬁve zero days
since June 2015:
CVE-2015-5119 – June 2015
CVE-2016-0984 – June 2015
CVE-2016-4117 – May 2016
CVE-2017-8759 – Sept 2017
CVE-2017-11292 – Oct 2017

Attacks Leveraging CVE-201711292
The attack begins with the delivery of an Oﬃce document, presumably in
this instance via e-mail. Embedded within the document is an ActiveX
object which contains the Flash exploit.

Flash object in the .docx ﬁle, stored in uncompressed format
The Flash object contains an ActionScript which is responsible for
extracting the exploit using a custom packer seen in other FinSpy exploits.

Unpacking routine for SWF exploit

The exploit is a memory corruption vulnerability that exists in the
“com.adobe.tvsdk.mediacore.BuﬀerControlParameters” class. If the
exploit is successful, it will gain arbitrary read / write operations within
memory, thus allowing it to execute a second stage shellcode.
The ﬁrst stage shellcode contains an interesting NOP sled with alternative
instructions, which was most likely designed in such a way to avoid
detection by antivirus products looking for large NOP blocks inside ﬂash
ﬁles:

NOP sled composed of 0x90 and 0x91 opcodes
The main purpose of the initial shellcode is to download second stage
shellcode from hxxp://89.45.67[.]107/rss/5uzosoﬀ0u.iaf.

Second stage shellcode
The second stage shellcode will then perform the following actions:
1. Download the ﬁnal payload (FinSpy) from
hxxp://89.45.67[.]107/rss/mo.exe
2. Download a lure document to display to the victim from the same IP
3. Execute the payload and display the lure document

Payload – mo.exe
As mentioned earlier, the “mo.exe” payload (MD5:
4a49135d2ecc07085a8b7c5925a36c0a) is the newest version of Gamma
International’s FinSpy malware, typically sold to nation states and other
law enforcement agencies to use in lawful surveillance operations. This
newer variant has made it especially diﬃcult for researchers to analyze
the malware due to many added anti-analysis techniques, to include a
custom packer and virtual machine to execute code.
The PCODE of the virtual machine is packed with the aplib packer.

Part of packed VM PCODE
After unpacking, the PCODE it will look like the following:

Unpacked PCODE
After unpacking the virtual machine PCODE is then decrypted:

Decrypted VM PCODE
The custom virtual machine supports a total of 34 instructions:

Example of parsed PCODE
In this example, the “1b” instruction is responsible for executing native
code that is speciﬁed in parameter ﬁeld.
Once the payload is successfully executed, it will proceed to copy ﬁles to
the following locations:

C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\AdapterTroubleshooter.exe
C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\15b937.cab
C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\install.cab
C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\msvcr90.dll
C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\d3d9.dll
The “AdapterTroubleshooter.exe” ﬁle is a legitimate binary which is
leveraged to use the famous DLL search order hijacking technique. The
“d3d9.dll” ﬁle is malicious and is loaded into memory by the legit binary
upon execution. Once loaded, the DLL will then inject FinSpy into the
Winlogon process.

Part of injected code in winlogon process
The payload calls out to three C2 servers for further control and
exﬁltration of data. We have observed two of them used in the past with
other FinSpy payloads. Most recently one of these C2 servers was used
together with CVE-2017-8759 in the attacks reported by FireEye in
September 2017. These IPs and other previous samples tie closely to the
BlackOasis APT cluster of FinSpy activity.

Targeting and Victims
BlackOasis’ interests span a wide gamut of ﬁgures involved in Middle
Eastern politics and verticals disproportionately relevant to the region.
This includes prominent ﬁgures in the United Nations, opposition
bloggers and activists, and regional news correspondents. During 2016,
we observed a heavy interest in Angola, exempliﬁed by lure documents
indicating targets with suspected ties to oil, money laundering, and other
illicit activities. There is also an interest in international activists and think
tanks.
Victims of BlackOasis have been observed in the following countries:
Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Libya, Jordan, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Iran,
Netherlands, Bahrain, United Kingdom and Angola.

Conclusions
We estimate that the attack on HackingTeam in mid-2015 left a gap on the
market for surveillance tools, which is now being ﬁlled by other
companies. One of these is Gamma International with their FinFisher suite

of tools. Although Gamma International itself was hacked by Phineas
Fisher in 2014, the breach was not as serious as it was in the case of
HackingTeam. Additionally, Gamma had two years to recover from the
attack and pick up the pace.
We believe the number of attacks relying on FinFisher software, supported
by zero day exploits such as the ones described here will continue to
grow.
What does it mean for everyone and how to defend against such attacks,
including zero-day exploits?
For CVE-2017-11292 and other similar vulnerabilities, one can use the
killbit for Flash within their organizations to disable it in any applications
that respect it. Unfortunately, doing this system-wide is not easily done,
as Flash objects can be loaded in applications that potentially do not
follow the killbit. Additionally, this may break any other necessary
resources that rely on Flash and of course, it will not protect against
exploits for other third party software.
Deploying a multi-layered approach including access policies, anti-virus,
network monitoring and whitelisting can help ensure customers are
protected against threats such as this. Users of Kaspersky products are
protected as well against this threat by one of the following detections:
