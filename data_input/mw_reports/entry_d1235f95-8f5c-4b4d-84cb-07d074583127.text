New Disk Wiper Malware Hits Hundreds of Ukrainian Computers
In addition to suffering a full-scale military invasion in recent weeks, Ukraine is also being
subjected to numerous cyberattacks aimed at crippling its organizations and digital
infrastructure. One of the latest of these is HermeticWiper, a new data wiper malware that
targets infrastructure and defense sectors in Ukraine, with additional reports of
compromised systems coming from Lithuania and Latvia.
HermeticWiper shares some similarities with the recently discovered WhisperGate malware,
in that it appears to function solely as a tool for destruction. After wiping the victim’s disk, it
then targets the Master Boot Record (MBR) before forcing a reboot, resulting in a total boot
failure and rendering the system inoperable.
First reported in a tweet by ESET Research on February 23rd, 2022, the threat intelligence
community subsequently named the new malware HermeticWiper, a reference to two of its
main activities. The wiper first hijacks a valid code-signing certificate from Hermetica Digital
1/15

Ltd. to gain the victim’s trust. It then uses a legitimate disk recovery program from EaseUS
Data Recovery Wizard, packed by the threat authors as a driver, to overwrite data in the
victim’s Master Boot Record (MBR) and thus corrupt the file system.
A decoy ransomware component has also been reported on some systems affected by
HermeticWiper, to distract the victim while the main functionality occurs.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
Wiper Overview
In this blog, BlackBerry researchers will analyze a sample hash of HermeticWiper, to see
what lies under the hood.
Sample hash:
0385EEAB00E946A302B24A91DEA4187C1210597B8E17CD9E2230450F5ECE21DA
The file presents itself as “conhost.exe,” borrowing the filename of the Console Windows
Host for Microsoft® Windows®. The executable file uses a standard Visual Studio Project
icon, as seen in Figure 1, and displays the Hermetica certificate shown in Figure 2. This
inclusion of a valid certificate helps the wiper to evade detection on the system by
appearing to come from a legitimate and trusted source.

A brief look into the file shows there are four drivers packaged inside. These drivers are
named DRV_X64, DRV_X86, DRV_XP_X64, and DRV_XP_X86, with each having “SZDD”
as the first few bytes of the file, as seen in Figure 3. This indicates that the drivers are
compressed with the built-in MS-DOS “compress.exe.”

Figure 3 – Compressed drivers
Once each driver has been extracted and saved as their own file on the victim’s system, an
unzipping program such as 7-Zip can be used to decompress the files and reveal what they
really are. An expired certificate shown in Figure 4 for CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development
Co. Ltd. can be found in each driver. A quick Internet search links this certificate to a disk
recovery software program called EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard.

Wiper Behavior
The files must be launched as Administrator for the wiper to execute. And for the system
reboot to be triggered, the first character of the file name must be C.
Immediately after launch, a new service with a four-character randomized name starts to
run, as seen in Figure 5.

By using a hex editor like HxD before and after launching, you can reveal the damage that
HermeticWiper is causing to the C:\ disk. Before execution, you can see the standard 52 90
4E 54 46 53 20 bytes (shown in Figure 6) that represent the start of an NTFS formatted
drive. After HermeticWiper begins to run, the threat corrupts those bytes, as you can see in
Figure 7. The malicious wiper will continue to change these values as it completes its
execution.

Figure 7 – C:\ drive after HermeticWiper runs
When HermeticWiper has finished corrupting the C:\ drive, the malware restarts the affected
system, which results in the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). After attempting to
restart again, the victim will be greeted with a new message indicating that their operating
system is missing, as shown in Figure 8. The C:\ drive is now wiped, and the system is
inoperable.

Load Driver and Wipe Disk

8/15

Taking a step back, let’s take a look at the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard. This is loaded
by the malware as a compressed driver. The wiper contains four copies of this driver, with
each corresponding to different OS versions (Windows XP or Windows 7+) and
architectures (32-bit or 64-bit). As shown in Figure 9, system information first needs to be
loaded by the wiper so it can then choose to start the correct driver version.

Once the OS is identified by the malware, the corresponding compressed driver is loaded.
DRV_X64 – Windows 7+ 64-bit
DRV_X86 – Windows 7+ 32-bit
DRV_XP_X64 – Windows XP 64-bit
9/15

DRV_XP_X86 – Windows XP 32-bit
HermeticWiper then decompresses the drivers with the LZMA algorithm. It uses
“DeviceIoControl” for file operations such as finding the PhysicalDriveID to get information
on the victim’s disk partitions, as shown in Figure 10.

With the drive information loaded, the CryptGenRandom function then begins to overwrite
data in the Master File Table fields, $Bitmap and $LogFile files, recursively in the AppData,
MyDocuments, Desktop, and Documents and Settings folders, and then the MBR. Once the
malware has finished overwriting this data with random bytes, the system will automatically
restart. This time, however, it will not boot because almost all the data on disk has been
wiped. The victim’s device is now unrecoverable.

Ransomware Component
Decoys and false flags are deployed in many scenarios where the goal is to confuse and
misdirect victims, to buy the adversary time to conduct its real mission of destroying and
disabling their opponent’s systems and infrastructure.
Let’s take a closer look at HermeticWiper’s decoy.
Sample hash:
4DC13BB83A16D4FF9865A51B3E4D24112327C526C1392E14D56F20D6F4EAF382
There is a ransomware component that, according to AVAST, sometimes comes along with
the wiper as a tool of misdirection. Upon launch, the ransomware (written in the
programming language “Go”) displays behavior typical of ransomware. The victim device’s
CPU utilization jumps to 100% as their files are encrypted. Once files are encrypted, they
are renamed with an “.encryptedJB” extension.
There is some good news, however. The encryption used by HermeticWiper is not strong,
and a free decryptor has already been made available for any files that victims are able to
salvage from their machines.

Conclusion
HermeticWiper differentiates itself from other wipers by its creator’s efforts to help it evade
detection. This malware was created specifically to destroy the machines of victims.
HermeticWiper was initially observed targeting Ukraine, but we are now hearing that it has
also spread to organizations in other countries. This sort of spillover was also observed with
the NotPetya attack, which affected numerous organizations in countries outside Ukraine.
While we’re used to seeing financially motivated malware such as ransomware, wipers that
exist solely for the purpose of data destruction have become a convenient tool for nefarious
actors when their goal is to cripple individual organizations or even entire industries within a
target area.
