Over the course of the past few weeks, new activity has been observed from TrickBot, one of
today’s largest malware botnets, with reports that its operators have helped create a new
ransomware strain called Diavol and that the TrickBot gang is returning to its roots as a
banking trojan with a new and updated banking module.
In a report from cybersecurity firm Fortinet, malware researchers Dor Neeamni and Asaf
Rubinfeld detailed the TrickBot gang’s newest work, the Diavol ransomware:
Per Fortinet, Diavol was seen in the wild in only one incident, deployed alongside a
version of the Conti ransomware in what appeared to have been a test run.
The Diavol code also contained multiple similarities with the code for the Conti
ransomware.
Following this discovery, Fortinet said it believed Diavol was the work of the Wizard
Spider gang, an industry codename for the operators of the TrickBot botnet and the
Conti ransomware.
The Diavol ransomware also reused some language from Egregor ransom notes, but
no other connection has been seen between the two.
No leak site has been discovered for Diavol yet.
Surprisingly, Diavol did not come with code to prevent the ransomware from running
inside former Soviet states, something that is found in almost all major ransomware
strains today.

The ransomware’s name, Diavol, means “devil” in Romanian.
But while Diavol has been linked to the TrickBot creators, in a report published yesterday,
security firm Kryptos Logic said it spotted changes to the TrickBot malware code itself.
Since June 2021, TrickBot has been seen pushing a new module on infected
computers. The new module contains a revamped version of its old banking
component that tries to intercept credentials for e-banking websites.
Called a “webinject” module, this component has been rewritten to include new
methods to inject malicious code inside banking websites.
Per Kryptos Logic, this new code appears to have been copied from the old Zeus
banking malware, different from the two webinject techniques TrickBot had used in
previous years.
Zeus-style injects work by proxying traffic through a local SOCKS server. If the web
traffic matches a list of banking login URLs, the traffic is modified accordingly with
malicious code to record credentials or carry out other operations.
Per Kryptos Logic, this new banking/webinject module shares substantial code
with IcedID‘s webinject module.
The move to support Zeus-style web injects may be an attempt from the TrickBot gang
to muscle into the territory of other Malware-as-a-Service banking trojans and steal
some of their customers in the underground cybercrime market.
The resumption of development of the webinject module indicates that TrickBot intends
to revive its bank fraud operation, which appears to have been shelved for over a year.
The addition of Zeus-style webinjects may suggest expansion of their Malware-as-aService platform, enabling users to bring their own webinjects.

TrickBot has brought back their bank fraud module, which has been updated to support
Zeus-style webinjects. This could suggest they are resuming their bank fraud
operation, and plan to expand access to those unfamiliar with their internal webinject
format. https://t.co/YrS2bVZ0Xt
