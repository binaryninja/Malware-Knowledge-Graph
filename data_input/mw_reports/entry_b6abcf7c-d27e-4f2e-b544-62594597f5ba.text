How to Slam a Door on the Cutwail Botnet: Enforce
DMARC
mimecast.com/blog/how-to-slam-a-door-on-the-cutwail-botnet-enforce-dmarc/

Key Points
The Cutwail botnet continues to be very active and often spoofs the brands of wellknown organizations via email as part of its attacks.
Though many well-known organizations use DMARC to limit abuse of their brands via
email, not enough email receiving organizations are enforcing on DMARC.
While not a magic bullet, DMARC can be an important contributor to improved security
when used more broadly and in conjunction with other security controls.

First discovered in 2007, Cutwail is a large botnet comprised of infected windows hosts. By
2009, it was determined that the Cutwail botnet was the largest botnet of its kind based on
the number of infected hosts. Cutwail is still active today, and its primary aim is to turn
infected hosts into spambots capable of generating high volumes of malicious and otherwise
unwanted email. In the past, Cutwail has been responsible for pushing out well-known
malware families like Gozi, URLZone and Dridex.
Over the past couple of months, Cutwail has become more active and has been sending
email-borne attacks loaded with malicious URLs and Excel file attachments. These attacks
have often been sent out spoofing the domains and brands of well-known global
organizations, such as Intuit, UPS, FedEx and ADP. Well-known brands are extremely
useful, in particular to spammy services such as Cutwail, given the vast majority of people
that receive them will at minimum recognize them, if not also regularly do business with
them, and thus be more likely to trust and engage with the emails.
The good news is that all of these companies, as well as many others, have done the right
thing to stop the email-borne exploitation of their online brands; They have implemented
DMARC and also have set the “p” values of their DMARC DNS entries to “reject.” This
means that any email security system that receives these fraudulent emails should be able to
analyze and reject them as imposters. Implementing DMARC is not a trivial IT project, and
thus we should give credit where credit is due to those domain owners that have successfully
done it.
The bad news is that many of these emails continue to land at their intended targets and
apparently are being acted on. Why? Unfortunately, not enough organizations are enforcing
on DMARC on their inbound email and thus the DMARC action request flag of “p=reject” is
falling on the security equivalent of deaf ears. This issue of lack of DMARC enforcement is
not new. In fact, it was recently reported by SC Magazine that attacks spoofing
Microsoft.com were ironically being delivered to organizations that were using Microsoft 365
as their email provider. Evidently, many organizations using Microsoft 365 are not enforcing
DMARC, even though Microsoft has Microsoft.com set to DMARC “reject.”
Let’s look at a couple recent examples of the malicious emails that are being sent by the
Cutwail botnet.

Note in these examples that these Cutwail generated emails are not using similar sending
domains to UPS and Intuit; Cutwail is using the actual domains of the spoofed organizations
– intuit.com & ups.com. It does this, combined with the appropriate branding and text, to
increase the credibility of the email and thus improve engagement with the receiver. In
addition, compelling email subjects also play a role in gaining trust and engagement.

Example subjects:
FedEx Billing Online - Invoice Ready for Payment
Your UPS Invoice is Ready
ADP Payroll Invoice(s) 04-NOV-2020: 193987187
FBA Inbound Shipment Bill of Lading Ready (FBA855RXJZV9)
Invoice 419665
Electronic Invoice (#05250943)
Reminder: Invoice 625953
Unfortunately, engagement with any of these emails rewards the target with the download of
the Dridex trojan from one of these locations:

With the Dridex trojan installed, the attackers have a lot of flexibility as to what comes next.
Unfortunately, the delivery of ransomware in the next stage of the attack has recently been
shown to be very popular.

The Bottom Line
While there are many ways Cutwail botnet initiated attacks can be stopped, such as with
security awareness training to address user engagement and sophisticated endpoint
protections to block the installation of the malware, it is particularly frustrating that a control
specifically designed to make this type of phishing more difficult for the phisher — DMARC
— has not yet been more broadly implemented. The domain owners have done their part,
what about everyone else in the world of email?

emails have proven to be effective.
