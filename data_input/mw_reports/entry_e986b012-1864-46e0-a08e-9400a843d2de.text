FIN7 Spear Phishing Campaign Targets Personnel Involved
in SEC Filings
fireeye.com /blog/threat-research/2017/03/fin7_spear_phishing.html
In late February 2017, FireEye as a Service (FaaS) identified a spear phishing campaign that appeared to be
targeting personnel involved with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings at various
organizations. Based on multiple identified overlaps in infrastructure and the use of similar tools, tactics, and
procedures (TTPs), we have high confidence that this campaign is associated with the financially motivated threat
group tracked by FireEye as FIN7.
FIN7 is a financially motivated intrusion set that selectively targets victims and uses spear phishing to distribute its
malware. We have observed FIN7 attempt to compromise diverse organizations for malicious operations – usually
involving the deployment of point-of-sale malware – primarily against the retail and hospitality industries.

Spear Phishing Campaign
All of the observed intended recipients of the spear phishing campaign appeared to be involved with SEC filings for
their respective organizations. Many of the recipients were even listed in their company’s SEC filings. The sender
email address was spoofed as EDGAR <filings@sec.gov> and the attachment was named
“Important_Changes_to_Form10_K.doc” (MD5: d04b6410dddee19adec75f597c52e386). An example email is
shown in Figure 1.

We have observed the following TTPs with this campaign:
The malicious documents drop a VBS script that installs a PowerShell backdoor, which uses DNS TXT
records for its command and control. This backdoor appears to be a new malware family that FireEye iSIGHT

Intelligence has dubbed POWERSOURCE. POWERSOURCE is a heavily obfuscated and modified version
of the publicly available tool DNS_TXT_Pwnage. The backdoor uses DNS TXT requests for command and
control and is installed in the registry or Alternate Data Streams. Using DNS TXT records to communicate is
not an entirely new finding, but it should be noted that this has been a rising trend since 2013 likely because it
makes detection and hunting for command and control traffic difficult.
We also observed POWERSOURCE being used to download a second-stage PowerShell backdoor called
TEXTMATE in an effort to further infect the victim machine. The TEXTMATE backdoor provides a reverse
shell to attackers and uses DNS TXT queries to tunnel interactive commands and other data. TEXTMATE is
“memory resident” – often described as “fileless” malware. This is not a novel technique by any means, but
it’s worth noting since it presents detection challenges and further speaks to the threat actor’s ability to
remain stealthy and nimble in operations.
In some cases, we identified a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload being delivered via POWERSOURCE. This
particular Cobalt Strike stager payload was previously used in operations linked to FIN7.
We observed that the same domain hosting the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload was also hosting a
CARBANAK backdoor sample compiled in February 2017. CARBANAK malware has been used heavily by
FIN7 in previous operations.

Victims
Thus far, we have directly identified 11 targeted organizations in the following sectors:
Financial services, with different victims having insurance, investment, card services, and loan focuses
Transportation
Retail
Education
IT services
Electronics
All these organizations are based in the United States, and many have international presences. As the SEC is a
U.S. regulatory organization, we would expect recipients of these spear phishing attempts to either work for U.S.based organizations or be U.S.-based representatives of organizations located elsewhere. However, it is possible
that the attackers could perform similar activity mimicking other regulatory organizations in other countries.

Implications
We have not yet identified FIN7’s ultimate goal in this campaign, as we have either blocked the delivery of the
malicious emails or our FaaS team detected and contained the attack early enough in the lifecycle before we
observed any data targeting or theft. However, we surmise FIN7 can profit from compromised organizations in
several ways. If the attackers are attempting to compromise persons involved in SEC filings due to their information
access, they may ultimately be pursuing securities fraud or other investment abuse. Alternatively, if they are tailoring
their social engineering to these individuals, but have other goals once they have established a foothold, they may
intend to pursue one of many other fraud types.
Previous FIN7 operations deployed multiple point-of-sale malware families for the purpose of collecting and
exfiltrating sensitive financial data. The use of the CARBANAK malware in FIN7 operations also provides limited
evidence that these campaigns are linked to previously observed CARBANAK operations leading to fraudulent

banking transactions, ATM compromise, and other monetization schemes.

Community Protection Event
FireEye implemented a Community Protection Event – FaaS, Mandiant, Intelligence, and Products – to secure all
clients affected by this campaign. In this instance, an incident detected by FaaS led to the deployment of additional
detections by the FireEye Labs team after FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering quickly analyzed the
malware. Detections were then quickly deployed to the suite of FireEye products.

variety of topics discussed in this post, including FIN7 and the POWERSOURCE and TEXTMATE malware.
