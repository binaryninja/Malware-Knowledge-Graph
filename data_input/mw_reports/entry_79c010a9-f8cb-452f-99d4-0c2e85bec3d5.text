Moving Left of the Ransomware Boom
accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/moving-left-ransomware-boom

To foster better collaboration and cyber ground truth, VMware and Accenture’s Cyber
Defense group teamed up to deliver relevant security research. Our goal is to expose
criminals’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and thereby help security teams better
focus their prevention, detection and response programs.
Ransomware isn’t new—in fact, it’s over 30 years old. Attacks date back as far as 1989 and
have been the most pervasive cyber threat since 2005, with a dramatic spike in recent years
that continues to increase. In fact, Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that the damage caused
by ransomware could cost up to $265 billion by 2031, making it ever more important for
companies to prepare their defenses and understand ways to stop the attackers prior to
ransomware deployment.

Time-to-Ransom (TTR)
Time-to-Ransom refers to the amount of time from when the threat actor gains initial access
into a network to the time the threat actor deploys the ransomware. This time can range from
hours to days, or even months.

The old quote “defenders have to be right 100% of the time” proves to be untrue. The reality
is that in most cases there are several opportunities for teams to disrupt the criminal's
behavior prior to the ransomware executing. This blog will examine the common tactics that
cybercriminals use to infiltrate and move around a company network prior to ransomware
deployment, paying close attention to the time-to-ransom (TTR). Each stage of the attacker
lifecycle offers unique opportunities to detect and remove them from the network prior to
significant and costly damage. It only takes one mitigation to break the criminals’ kill chain.
Cyber Extortion at scale is big business and business is good for criminals
As ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) explodes in popularity on the crimeware forums,
cybercriminals are finding new and unique ways to deploy ransomware across organizations.
Ransomware groups may be recruiting insiders or affiliates specializing in a specific part of
the attack chain to increase the stealth of their attack while employing multiple extortion
tactics by first stealing company data before locking it up. According to Accenture incident
responders, data extortion was confirmed in about 30% of 10 cases they analyzed between
June 2020 and June 2021.
As ransomware groups become increasingly capable, TTR can decrease. In contrast,
however, if the actor combines data extortion with data destruction, the on-network
requirements to steal sensitive data require greater TTR and additional on-host activities,
providing opportunities for detection. According to Accenture incident response investigators,
in analyzed cases over the past year, the TTR has been as low as 2.5 hours and as high as
six months, with Carbon Black estimating that the TTR is on average between two and four
days. The longer the TTR, the more opportunity there is for an organization to detect and
respond to an attack prior to data destruction.
Methodology
Accenture Cyber Defense utilized data from over 10 recent cyber investigations, forensics
and response (CIFR) ransomware incident response investigations, combined with
Accenture’s Cyber Threat Intelligence’s (ACTI) dark web monitoring to identify popular preransomware deployment network activities. Additionally, VMware Carbon Black leveraged
data from the Carbon Black Cloud where the product suite can successfully prevent the
execution of ransomware, as well as the pre-execution TTPs that were observed prior to
ransomware payload execution.
Our threat research uses MITRE ATT&CK® – a comprehensive framework to document
adversary TTPs - to focus on TTPs relevant to the initial stages of infection that precede a
ransomware attack. We will also be focused on the TTR to help teams better create
playbooks and responses when an infection occurs.
MITRE ATT&CK Stages

2/18

Initial Access
Accenture and Carbon Black have identified remote desktop protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities
as a primary initial access method for ransomware actors. RDP is exploited in roughly half of
the documented attacks that are escalated to VMware’s Threat Analysis Unit (TAU). In many
of these attacks there is a 48-to-92-hour period between the initial observed RDP access
and the ransomware portion of the attack. Similarly, Accenture has found RDP vulnerabilities
to be a preferred method for several ransomware groups. For example, the ransomware
group Avaddon appears to prefer exploiting RDP vulnerabilities as a breach methodology.
This group has advertised specific interest in acquiring specialists who can develop network
access through compromised RDP sessions or virtual private network (VPN) connections.
The second-greatest portion of the remaining cases studied by TAU initially start with a social
engineering element like phishing emails. These emails will typically contain an initial
dropper which is either an office document or an executable concealed in an archive format,
like a zip file. The initial dropper will either download a first-stage payload like IcedID, SdBot,
Trickbot, or Emotet or leverage PowerShell to execute a Cobalt Strike cradle. These tools
help the threat actor gain unauthorized access to the remote systems and can perform a
variety of functions including, downloading and executing additional files, credential
harvesting, and lateral movement operations.
The remainder are known vulnerabilities being exploited combined with lateral movement.
Execution
Accenture Security and VMware TAU continue to observe ransomware actors leverage
living-off-the-land techniques in conjunction with off-the-shelf tools like Cobalt Strike, Koadic,
PowerShell Empire, and Metasploit. Because of the effectiveness of tools like Cobalt Strike,
as well as the anonymity that their popularity provides, many actors have adopted them into
their overall attacker portfolios.
Prior to bans on ransomware advertisements by many forums, dark web findings indicated
that at least Ragnar Locker and REvil operators had actively recruited hackers experienced
with commodity tools including the Cobalt Strike platform; additionally, actors regularly sell or
release cracked versions of Cobalt Strike, lowering the barrier to entry for this versatile tool.
Cobalt Strike Beacon, a penetration testing product, provides vast functionality against the
host, including privilege escalation, file transfer, command execution, port scanning and
lateral movement, which is why it is an increasingly popular tool for ransomware operations.
Persistence
VMware TAU and the Carbon Black Cloud identified attackers using PowerShell to modify
windows registry and startup files as the predominate method of gaining persistence on
endpoints observed in the bar graph below. This finding is consistent with observations by
Accenture’s CIFR team. For easiest viewing, the graph below represents a two-week period,
however, the trends have been consistent over time. Based on Windows Antimalware Scan

The commodity trojans prevalent in ransomware operations, like Trickbot, IcedID, and
Emotet, have the capability to create scheduled tasks for persistence.
Privilege Escalation / Credential Access
Privilege Escalation / Credential AccessPrivilege escalation and credential access are
priorities for ransomware operators, as these tactics often enable additional actions against
the network, such as lateral movement or disabling endpoint monitoring software. Credential
harvesting is one of the tactics used to ensure secondary extortion methods have higher
efficacy. This allows attackers to gain access to business communication channels like email,
Slack and Microsoft teams, which can make real-time response communications a challenge
during an outbreak.
Attackers are using Mimikatz predominately to harvest credentials. The execution of signed
Mimikatz binaries remains the highest detection related to credential harvesting that VMWare
has historically observed. This is followed by PowerShell running Mimikatz and credential
theft using NTDSutil. Commodity tools, such as Meterpreter, have built-in techniques to try to
obtain system-level administration privileges.
<<< Start >>>

Lateral Movement
Lateral movement is a key component of an effective attack and ransomware groups can
use port scans and the lateral movement capabilities embedded in commodity malware and
tools. As the use of Cobalt Strike increases among ransomware operators, Accenture
Security and Carbon Black have, in turn, observed attackers use Cobalt Strike Beacon
capabilities, such as named pipes over Server Message Block (SMB) and WinRM to move
laterally in targeted networks.

Defense Evasion
Ransomware threat actors are keenly aware of being exposed through antivirus or other
endpoint defense detections and would proactively try to nullify these tools with antivirus
blocking tools or by uninstalling antivirus from a privileged account.

Carbon Black monitors numerous techniques that fall into the defense evasion category. The
graph below is data solely from AMSI-based detections; historically attempting to unload
AMSI via reflection is the most popular PowerShell defense evasion technique observed.
<<< Start >>>

Source: Carbon Black AMSI data
<<< End >>>
In other cases, ransomware operators will try to work around endpoint defenses. For
example, in one ransomware attack at a health and public services company, the threat
actors executed a Cobalt Strike payload. However, the execution sequence was detected by
Windows Defender and quarantined accordingly. After about two days of triggering Windows
Defender detections, the threat actor pivoted to the use of another open-source tool called
Koadic. This tool is also a Windows Post-Exploitation rootkit that utilizes Windows Script
Host; however, it creates small payloads executed in memory which can be less noisegenerating. Throughout the engagement, the threat actor continued to monitor the endpoint
detections and would pivot to new tools or tactics in an attempt to avoid them.

8/18

Command and control
Often ransomware actors achieve command and control in one of two ways. First, the actor
will leverage compromised credentials in combination with exposed RDP. Second, the
attackers once again leverage the capabilities within Cobalt Strike to communicate externally.
In one CIFR investigation, the ransomware actors used domain fronting to disguise the
destination of their command and control.
Exfiltration
Ransomware groups have widely adopted double extortion as a core tactic to ensure
profitability. In fact, nearly 40% of security professionals said double-extortion ransomware
was the most observed new ransomware attack technique in 2020. By taking time to quietly
exfiltrate sensitive information from the organization, cybercriminals gain incrementally
significant leverage on their victim organizations, forcing organizations to not only pay to
decrypt their content but also prevent potentially harmful data from being sold or otherwise
publicly disclosed.
Ransomware groups will use a variety of methods to exfiltrate data, and this additional
process will likely mean more TTR, leaving artifacts that can trigger detection and
remediation efforts.
In one investigation, Accenture identified a ransomware gang use RClone to exfiltrate 2TB of
data prior to executing Maze and Mountlocker ransomware. RClone is an open-source
command line tool that allows the actors to sync files from the local disk to a cloud storage
provider. During another investigation the ransomware actors downloaded and utilized
curl.exe to maximize download capabilities and exfiltrate .bat files and a tmp.vbs file used to
calculate disk space on the staging server.
Opportunities for Defenders
The above pre-ransomware tactics leave evidence that provides organizations with possible
detection opportunities prior to exfiltration of data and deployment of destructive malware.
VMware and ACTI recommend implementing a managed detection and response (MDR)
service like Accenture’s, which is a true multi-tenant, cloud-based service that provides
extended threat detection and response via network monitoring, endpoint management and
remediation; security incident analysis; and escalation via a dedicated team of security
experts. The Accenture MDR service helps secure the client’s endpoints, while leveraging
their existing investments, with a managed endpoint detection and response service that
provides additional investigation of identified suspicious endpoint-based activities, and
enhanced context, threat hunting and proactive responses.
