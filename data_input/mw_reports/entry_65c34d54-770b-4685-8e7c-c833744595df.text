New Inight into nergetic ear’
Watering Hole Attack on Turkih
Critical Infratructure
Novemer 2, 2017, Yonathan Klijnma

On Octoer 20th U-CRT pulihed an alert (TA-17-293A) with information aout
the activitie of an APT targeting the critical infratructure ector. The report
contain an extenive et of indicator with detailed context and information around
them. Part of the Ruian phere of influence, the threat group dicued in the UCRT report i the perpetrator of documented cer epionage attack around the
world, man of which target indutrial and manufacturing rm and critical
infratructure. Known  man name, the group i mot prominentl known a
‘nergetic ear’ and ‘Crouching Yeti.’
Detailed anali of nergetic ear’ malware and activitie wa recentl done 
Kaperk, and RikIQ initiall invetigated them earlier thi ear. Through our we
crawling network, we were ale to determine that a weite elonging to a Turkih
energ compan wa eing ued in a watering hole attack targeting people
aociated with Turkih critical infratructure. Compromied via a uppl chain
attack, the ite wa injected with M credential-harveting malware. RikIQ then
linked the maliciou infratructure to a tring of related Turkih ite that were
compromied for the ame purpoe and traced the attack ack to a likel timeframe
in which it egan.
Watering hole attack, epeciall thoe involving uppl chain compromie, have
een an extremel e ective method for operator of cer epionage campaign
ecaue the target victim of peci c group, organization, and region, and with

cloe ut tumultuou relation etween Turke and the Ruian Federation, Turke i
not a urpriing target for nergetic ear. We hared our nding with law
enforcement and national CRT partner, ut now that the indicator have ecome
pulic per U-CRT’ pulication, we want to give our unique point of view on the
threat.

trategical Compromie for Reconnaiance
Part of nergetic ear’ campaign involved trategical we compromie that give
them expoure to peci c target. For example, prior activitie from the group
include compromiing oftware upplier for programmale logic controller (PLC)
component ued in critical infratructure and ackdooring them with the Havex
malware. In the cae of the campaign decried in the U-CRT report, the group
compromied the weite of Turca Petrol, a Turkih energ compan, located at
turca.com.tr.

In Ma 2017, during one of our crawl of Turca’ weite, RikIQ encountered a

watering hole etup in ue  nergetic ear. In the creenhot of the weite aove,
ou can ee four top element: ‘Join the Turca nerg Famil,’ ‘Announcement,’
‘Compan New,’ and ‘Tv interview.’ Thee eparate element are tructured a
iframe to other page on the weite a hown in the DOM capture elow:

However, the iframe’d page for the ‘Announcement’ uection wa modi ed 
nergetic ear operator to contain a mall addition in the form of an image
incluion:

The image URL redirect to a link uing the le:// cheme, which force the
connection through the le protocol, which then allow the group to harvet
Microoft M credential. Thi ehavior wa alo noted  Talo, which wrote a
detailed anali of the pear-phihing email elonging to the ame campaign a
thi watering hole attack. It’ intereting to note that the ack-end erver ued in

the attack eem to e written uing the Tornadoerver Pthon framework ued for
uilding we and networking application:

In the cae of Turca Petrol, elow i the entire chain of event we oerved during
the crawl:

In and of itelf, thi compromie eem targeted at Turca Petrol and thoe with a
cloe relationhip with the uine, a tactic that mirror other nergetic ear
campaign. entiall, the group’ goal i to influence area of interet to the
Ruian Federation. What we’d like to how, which eem to e miing from the UCRT report, i the entire chain of event for thi attack.
RikIQ found that the M credential harveting hot at 184.154.150.66 i not alwa
directl included on the weite. Intead, the intermediar hot at 103.41.177.58 i
uuall preent on the we page, which, in turn, redirect viitor—mot likel with
ome ltering to avoid unwanted tra c—to the M harveting hot. Additionall,
the URL format of the le requeted, which in thi cae wa turca_icon.png, i not
related to the referring weite. Intead, nergetic ear eem to ue a form of
tagging to correlate an poile victim and their ource weite. The format we
oerved i <tag>_icon.png and <tag>.png.

trategical Compromie for road Targeting
The previou example of the Turca Petrol weite compromie howed peci c
targeting. While compan-peci c weite were compromied in thi campaign,

‘general purpoe’ weite were alo amongt the victim. One uch ite i
plantengineering.com which erve a an information and new hu for the critical
infratructure ector.

Fig-6 Another compromied weite linked to the attack
For a few month in earl 2017, thi weite had one of it reource compromied,
likel meaning that nergetic ear operator had road acce to the erver. On the
main page of the weite, a reource load from
/tpo3conf/ext/t3_jlidernew/re/j/jquer.eaing.j a een in our crawl:

At the ottom of the cript, we can nd the M credential harveting link, which i
emedded a an image element in the main page’ DOM:

When we go through more of our data for thi ver impli ed direct image incluion,
we nd a pattern in the URL and weite. Here are three of our hit:

All three URL are the ame, a i the injected content. All the a ected weite are

Fig-10 Other a ected ite
From our data, RikIQ found that controleng.com, plantengineering.com, and
cemag.com were all a ected  the injection from nergetic ear. ecaue the’re
geared toward engineer working in the critical infratructure ector and thu prime
target for thi watering hole attack, the odd are that CF Media’ other weite
were a ected. In fact, CF Media ha at leat ix con rmed rand that pulih new

Concluion: Don’t Feed the ear
Over the pat few ear, uppl-chain attack are ecoming more and more
prevalent in the attacker’ portfolio. Javacript can e changed and compromied
without the knowledge of the ite owner, nding it wa onto a ite when pulic
code wa modi ed downtream. To prevent thi, ite owner mut have an
undertanding of what elong to their organization, how it’ connected to the ret
of their aet inventor, including inventoring all the third-part code running on
their we aet o the can avoid eing a pawn  operator like nergetic ear.
