Conti puts the ‘organized’ in organized crime

Combing through business intelligence platforms to find new prospects. Deciding whether to
focus on huge multinational companies or small- and medium-sized businesses. Finding the
right person to contact in the organization. Developing a script that will land information
that’s critically needed for success.
The above scenario is one that may seem familiar to anyone that works in sales. However,
this set of actions has also been adopted by organizations which make money by less
conventional means, particularly criminals who are responsible for ransomware attacks.
Due in part to the leak of information tied to the Conti ransomware group, Intel 471 was able
to piece together the inner workings of the notorious criminal syndicate. With this
information, researchers were able to understand how Conti conducted its actions, which
often mirrored processes used by countless legitimate businesses.
Intel 471 discovered communications tied to one division of Conti which had its own
dedicated mission. This team was responsible for collecting information on targets for
ongoing and future attacks, drafting phishing scripts that were used over the phone and sent
via email, and applying multiple forms of pressure in the course of ransomware negotiations.
The team had access to several open-source intelligence (OSINT) and business intelligence
tools, as well as a legal “expert” who provided advice on how to threaten victims with
litigation or official complaints that would be sent to government authorities. In chats found
by Intel 471 researchers, some team members were unaware they were working for criminals,
instead believing they worked for a company providing competitive intelligence to their
customer base.
Team Building!
The division, known inside Conti as the “Fire Team,” started in July 2021 as a way for the
gang to invent cover stories for phishing phone calls to targeted personnel, as well as
randomize spam letters to potential victims. By November 2021, the team consisted of 10
people, which prepared operational and revenue reports on potential targets. The team
leader allegedly made US $3,000 per month while members were paid US $2,000 per
month. In addition to their salary, team members also received a one percent cut of any
ransom they helped negotiate. While ransom cuts were dispersed via cryptocurrency, some
salaries were paid via prepaid bank cards.
Despite initially being stood up to do reconnaissance on future targets, the team started
ransomware negotiations as more members were brought on board.

The reports put together by the team contained general information on targeted companies
that included operations and revenue. However, the team focused heavily on the target’s
personnel. The reports were required to include phone numbers, email addresses and social
media accounts of the company’s leadership, mid-level employees, and some information
technology personnel. Leaders requested contact information of at least 20 personnel per
report, with encouragement to focus on female employees.
Some people were also tasked to collect open source information on a target’s network
infrastructure following directions that included:
Internet domains
WHOIS data like IP notations, domain registrar, age, and who purchased the domain.
Subdomains, with IP addresses if possible
SSL certificates in raw format, open TCP ports, and vulnerabilities found using OSINT
tools
“Remember, any information about the company may be useful for its competitor (our
client), therefore, do not disregard any nuances that may seem insignificant at first glance.
We need EVERYTHING!,” a team leader posted in a Russian-language chat discovered by
Intel 471 researchers.
The team apparently utilized several tools and subscription-based services to gather the
information required. Those most frequently mentioned included the SignalHire contact
information platform, the SpiderFoot OSINT tool and the Shodan search engine. Another
team member brought on in November 2021 apparently also had access to a paid version of
the ZoomInfo business intelligence platform.
Companies that made the cut
In the early stages of standing up the division, the higher-level leaders of Conti asked for
draft reports on a variety of high-profile technology, pharmaceutical and finance industry
companies. However, a month later, the team changed direction, focusing on organizations
in the aerospace, chemical, defense, energy, hospitality and medical equipment industries,
particularly those with an annual revenue from US $500 million to US $5 billion.
As affiliates launched attacks, reconnaissance assignments changed. Actors from other parts
of the group told the team to find information on dental clinics and online stories, as they
were considered to be the “best” targets. Preference also was given to insurance, law and
logistics companies.
Circling back on deliverables

The Fire Team’s leader took the information gathered in the reports and used it for various
ransomware negotiations, often collaborating with other people working within the
syndicate. Some of these actors managed calls to Conti victims and potential targets, while
others would jump into ongoing conversations and leave messages for victims, even if they
did not start the negotiation process. Additionally, an alleged “lawyer” familiar with U.S. and
European legislation sought additional ways to pressure hacked companies with threats of
litigation from customers or employees, or official complaints that would be sent to
government authorities. This set of actors would also have side conversations about
ransomware victims, primarily focused on data that would be posted on the Conti name-andshame blog from time to time.
Over the course of the conversations Intel 471 researchers observed, other actors gave the
Fire Team feedback on what types of companies it should reconnaissance on in the future.
One actor specifically mentioned that they were having trouble convincing JP MorganChase
employees over the phone to install malware. In turn the actor suggested targeting smaller
companies with less strict security policies.
No job is perfect
Even criminal syndicates can’t avoid office politics. Despite the structure set up by Conti,
team members still complained to their bosses and one another about time spent working
and the amount of money each member made. One team member who received 0.5% of
ransom payouts often claimed to have a much higher workload compared to the team leader
and complained about being exploited. The team leader often called this actor “greedy” and
actively sought to give this person more work and pay the actor less.
Ransomware, Inc.
One of the biggest mysteries for years when discussing ransomware was wondering how
these criminal groups conducted operations. With the Conti leaks, the information security
community now has the best look it's ever gotten at what makes these criminal groups tick.
As Intel 471’s analysis shows, these groups are set up to conduct crimes as if they were a
legitimate business. There are divisions dedicated to examining every facet of a potential
target — no matter the size — in the hopes that the information can help them extract more
money post-attack. The stereotype of young men in a basement coding their way into
international crime sprees is woefully inaccurate. Ransomware-as-a-service groups operate
like corporate entities, with payroll, revenue goals and salary bonuses worked into their
operations. By understanding their inner workings, security teams can better adjust their
threat models and take the necessary steps to make sure that security measures make similar
reconnaissance efforts worthless.
