The US Department of Justice says that the Microsoft Office 365 email accounts of
employees at 27 US Attorneys' offices were breached by the Russian Foreign Intelligence
Service (SVR) during the SolarWinds global hacking spree.
"The APT is believed to have access to compromised accounts from approximately May 7
to December 27, 2020," the DOJ said in a statement issued earlier today.
"The compromised data included all sent, received, and stored emails and attachments
found within those accounts during that time,
"While other districts were impacted to a lesser degree, the APT group gained access to
the O365 email accounts of at least 80 percent of employees working in the U.S.
Attorneys’ offices located in the Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Districts of New
York." [emphasis ours]

"After learning of the malicious activity, the Office of the Chief Information Officer eliminated
the identified method by which the actor was accessing the O365 email environment and in
accordance with FISMA, the department took steps to notify the appropriate federal
agencies, Congress, and the public as warranted," the DOJ added.

The DOJ confirmed that the hacking group behind the SolarWinds supply-chain attack
breached the Department’s Microsoft O365 email environment in a statement published on
January 6, 2021.
In April, the United States government formally accused the Russian government of
orchestrating the SolarWinds attack.
The White House named the SVR's hacking division (aka APT29, The Dukes, or Cozy
Bear) as the group behind the cyber espionage activity exploiting the SolarWinds Orion
platform, which allowed them to access the networks of multiple US federal agencies and
private tech sector firms.

The SolarWinds Orion supply-chain attack
The attackers breached SolarWinds' internal systems and trojanized the Orion Software
Platform source code and builds released between March 2020 and June 2020.
These malicious builds were later used to deploy a backdoor tracked as Sunburst to "fewer
than 18,000" victims, but, luckily, the Russian hackers only picked a substantially lower
number of targets for second-stage exploitation.
Before the attack was disclosed, SolarWinds displayed a list of 300,000 customers
worldwide [1, 2] on its website: over 425 US Fortune 500 companies, all top ten US telecom
companies, as well as a long list of govt agencies (the US Military, the US Pentagon, the
State Department, NASA, NSA, Postal Service, NOAA, the US Department of Justice, and
the Office of the President of the United States).
Multiple US govt agencies later confirmed that they were breached, including:
the Department of the Treasury,
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA),
the Department of State,
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (part of the U.S. Department of Health),
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
the Department of Energy (DOE),
and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).
SolarWinds reported expenses of $3.5 million from last year's supply-chain attack in March,
including costs related to remediation and incident investigation.
