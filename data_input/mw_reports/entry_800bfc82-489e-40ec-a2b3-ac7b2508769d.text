The Islamic Republic of Iran is unique in that its most powerful officials—namely Supreme
Leader Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—are inaccessible, while its
most accessible officials—including Foreign Minister Javad Zarif—are far less powerful.
Iran’s offensive cyber activities are almost exclusively overseen by the IRGC—likely without
the oversight of the country’s publicly “elected” officials—and composed of a scattered set of
independent contractors who mix security work, criminal fraud, and more banal software
development. While the relationships between proxies and governments can range from
passive support to complete control, Iran’s indigenous threat actors maintain an arm’s-length
relationship to the state, with certain operations orchestrated to meet the needs of the
government.36
After successfully suppressing the 2009 Green Movement and first detecting the Stuxnet
attack in 2010, Iranian threat actors conducted sustained campaigns against domestic and
foreign adversaries. These indigenous operations appear to be performed by small groups of
individuals that have varying levels of technology experience with no more than ten people
per team. These campaigns and the resources produced by the groups range from
rudimentary to relatively professional, but most actors still face a low capacity ceiling.37
Though U.S. officials and some cybersecurity companies have speculated that Tehran has
received technical assistance from countries like Russia and North Korea, the level of
sophistication is commensurate with the established practices of amateur hacking
communities inside Iran.38 While Iranians have demonstrated talents in social engineering
and embedding themselves in compromised networks, this alone is not indicative of external
training or technological transfers.
On several occasions, Iranian threat actors have used off-the-shelf or pirated versions of
professional penetration testing tools to conduct campaigns, but there is little indication of
Tehran acquiring exploits or malware from foreign governments. Iran has acquired hardware
for internet surveillance from Chinese telecommunication firms and maintains cooperative
agreements with Russia on cybersecurity; however, these relationships differ from providing
Tehran with offensive cyber capabilities.39 No publicly documented or privately observed
attack has demonstrated the use of tools or resources that are beyond the capacity of Iranian
threat actors.

In principle, the tools and tactics used in cyber operations are subject to an exposure risk.
Unlike conventional weapons, malware attacks or other cyber activities lose their
effectiveness when discovered and when their functionality and infrastructure is documented.
Describing a missile does not provide effective countermeasures, but describing malware
can provide antivirus companies and system administrators the ability to protect systems.
State-aligned threat actors will likely not employ the most sophisticated tools and strategies
available to them unless the target is well protected and worth potentially exposing tradecraft
to compromise. However, unlike in other countries, there are not observed examples from
Iranian threat actors of escalation into more sophisticated attacks against hardened
targets.40
Iranian threat actors conduct campaigns with established toolkits that sometimes last for
years and ensnare hundreds of targets. However, the fluid nature and decentralization of
these groups make them relatively difficult to track. Malware that is publicly attributed to
Tehran is often abandoned immediately on exposure, and identifiable members appear to
change groups over time. Some groups seem to split up, have members move elsewhere, or
even collaborate, further blurring lines.41 For example, while an IRGC-affiliated group labeled
Rocket Kitten was the most active operator for a two-year period (2014–2016), attracting
press attention as Iran’s premiere threat, it has since faded into quiescence, eclipsed by the
actor Oilrig.42
Despite their substantial financial impact, Tehran’s disruptive operations against foreign
targets have been technically simple. The compromise of a small number of IT personnel
enabled the destruction of data on computers maintained by Saudi Aramco, eventually
resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.43 In only a few campaigns have
Iranian threat actors shown the professionalism and sophistication approaching that
expected of a nation-state actor; in one such case, the operation could be tied directly to the
Ministry of Intelligence (Magic Kitten, discussed later).44
Success can often be attributed to security failures and to poor protection of infrastructure on
the part of the victim, alongside opportunistic targeting and patience by the attacker. The
defacement of Voice of America’s websites by the Iranian Cyber Army, one of the first
disruptive attacks by Iran against the United States, was accomplished through social
engineering the news agency’s domain name service provider.45 Other basic security failures
gave Iranians a toehold in the networks of Las Vegas Sands Corp. after its owner, Sheldon
Adelson, advocated military force against Iran.46 Symantec, an American cybersecurity
company, noted that the perpetrators of a recent Saudi-focused campaign had invested a
“significant amount of preparatory work for the operation,” but the custom malware was
described by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky as “generally of low quality” partially
derived from open-source toolkits.47
Similarly, a major attack on the American financial sector—known as Operation Ababil—
which caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, was described as one of the largest
DDoS attacks known at the time. Yet it took only a few young Iranian computer experts,
3/16

breaching thousands of websites that were running vulnerable software, to pool enough
bandwidth to overwhelm the infrastructure of banks and cause unpredicted software
failures.48 Thus, while Iranian threat actors have limited capacity, through basic tradecraft
and persistence they can still be effective at espionage and sabotage.
The overall sophistication and dedication observed in such campaigns has not significantly
changed in the decade that Iran has engaged in offensive cyber operations—the attacks
documented against Las Vegas Sands Corp. in 2014 are comparable to those used against
Saudi Arabia in renewed hostilities over the course of 2016-2017. Indeed, many research
disclosures cover groups that have been active for several years, using the same malware
with only incremental changes over the course of time.
While sophistication alone can be a superficial metric of posed threat, Iranian operations do
not demonstrate the common technical precautions taken by other nation-state actors (such
as obfuscating malware), and, even with strong social engineering capabilities, attacks are
often betrayed by a lack of investment in nontechnical resources (such as fluency in English
or personal tailoring of messages).49 These resource constraints also account for why
Iranians are more effective at compromising dissidents—Iranian threat actors understand
their target’s context and language, as opposed to when they are tasked with European
languages or other cultures. Iran shows little indication of becoming a first-tier cyber power in
the foreseeable future unless it begins to further organize its operations and invest in
professionalism.

Magic Kitten
In January 2015, the German news outlet Der Spiegel released previously unpublished
documents on cyber espionage conducted by American intelligence agencies.50 One of them
revealed an NSA tactic labeled “fourth party collection,” which is the practice of breaking into
the command and control infrastructure of foreign-state-sponsored hackers to look over their
shoulders. The presentation describes a real-life example of acquiring intelligence and
stealing victims from a group code-named VOYEUR by the NSA, otherwise known as Magic
Kitten.
Magic Kitten appears to be among the oldest and most elaborate threat actors originating in
Iran. It is also distinct from other groups because of its apparent relationship with the Iranian
Ministry of Intelligence rather than the IRGC. However, Magic Kitten’s activities mirror those
of other groups, with the primary targets being Iranians inside Iran and Tehran’s regional
rivals. The earliest observed samples of Magic Kitten’s custom malware agent dates to 2007,
well before other known malware apparently originated, and the threat actor continues to be
active.
Magic Kitten appears to exercise the most mature tradecraft of Iran-based threat actors. It
has opportunistically compromised dozens of websites at random (including those of an
Indian hospital, an Italian architect, and a well-known Canadian comedian) to create a relay
4/16

network to hide its operations. Such attention to tradecraft appears elsewhere in Magic
Kitten’s operations, including in the design of malware, which is modular in nature.
Magic Kitten has not been observed using sophisticated exploits and instead appears to rely
on social engineering and other common tactics to deceive users. In the case of the
journalist Vahid Pour Ostad, the malware was sent by his former Ministry of Intelligence
interrogator with a threat attached and relied on private records that would have been
available only to government actors. This coordination represents both independent
confirmation of the NSA’s attribution and an extreme example of the strategies employed by
Magic Kitten. Other samples of the malware agent appear to have been delivered posing as
Turkish asylum forums for Syrian refugees.
The NSA presentation also provides a window on Magic Kitten’s targets up to May 2011,
portraying an operation focused on North America, Europe, and the Middle East. These
campaigns continued through the June 2013 presidential election of Hassan Rouhani,
provoking a blogpost from Google about related attacks.51 As the election approached,
exposed logs showed the daily capture of dozens of accounts connected to Iranian cultural
and media figures, graduate students, and social activists (including individuals that would
later join the Rouhani administration). Magic Kitten continued to target Iranians after the
election, attempting to unmask pseudonymous internet users by baiting them with content on
women’s rights and the security establishment.
Like other Iranian operations, Magic Kitten maintains a strong secondary interest in
conducting espionage against regional targets and international foreign policy institutions.
CrowdStrike, another American cybersecurity company, accounts for part of this focus on
“international corporations, mainly in the technology sector” and other political targets.52 An
NSA slide with a victim map portrays a broad-reaching operation targeting nearly every
country in the Middle East. Sinkhole data collected from expired domains previously used as
relays and other fallback infrastructure suggest that Magic Kitten, or the malware agent used,
continues to actively compromise individuals in Germany, Indonesia, Iraq, Lebanon, the
Netherlands, Palestine, Pakistan, Qatar, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United
Arab Emirates. Notably, compromised individuals in Iraq were also typically in Iraqi
Kurdistan, mirroring a common pattern with other threat actors.
A diagram within the NSA presentation suggests that the malware agent employed by Magic
Kitten was also used at the time by Iran’s Shia Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, under
independent infrastructure. While Hezbollah has been known to maintain its own offensive
cyber operations and engage in intelligence sharing with Iran, there has been little prior
evidence of direct sharing of tools.53

Understanding Iranian Government Involvement and Attribution

5/16

It is often difficult to determine the origins and perpetrators of Iranian offensive cyber
operations, as these campaigns may disappear as quickly as they appear. Public exposure
often leads them to change tactics and abandon tools, making tracking even more difficult.
The history of cyber operations targeting Iranians and originating from Iran is populated by
groups that arise out of nowhere and conduct campaigns for ambiguous reasons over a finite
time span, then disappear. This unusually frenetic character conspicuously differentiates the
Iranian hacking ecosystem from that found elsewhere, particularly those tied to state actors
in advanced countries.
The history of cyber operations targeting Iranians and originating from Iran is populated
by groups that arise out of nowhere and conduct campaigns for ambiguous reasons
over a finite time span, then disappear.
The amateur hackers connected to the Iranian defacement community have long been
politically engaged and have often vandalized foreign sites for ostensibly nationalistic
reasons.54 In one of the first international incidents attributed to Iran, domestic hacking
groups in mid-2008 exchanged tit-for-tat defacements with competitors in neighboring Arab
countries after the official sites of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani were vandalized with antiShia content by an Emirati hacker. Such defacement activities can often evolve into stateaffiliated activities: one of the participants in the anti-Sunni website-defacement campaign in
2008 was later linked to the Iranian Cyber Army. This transition from patriotic hackers to
state-aligned threat actors, and the ambiguity between civic nationalism and state
involvement, mirrors the apparent development of cyber communities in China and
elsewhere.55
In only two incidents have Iranian government entities taken direct credit for the defacement
of political opposition sites, both attributed to branches of the Revolutionary Guard. The first
case was the March 2010 takedown of sites connected to the organization Human Rights
Activists in Iran, which was alleged to be training cadres to mobilize against the regime like
the Velvet Revolution. The attack relied on the arrest of a website administrator inside the
country rather than on complicated tactics. The arrests and destruction of data had a lasting
impact on the organization by instilling fear in members and giving rise to rumors about
collaboration with the government.
The second government-initiated campaign, carried out during a Shia holiday in December
2013, led to the defacement of nine human rights and independent media websites with a
Quranic verse in Arabic and Persian. The IRGC’s Public Relations Department announced
that the operation had been conducted by the Revolutionary Guard’s Kerman Branch and
claimed that the defaced websites had been established by the country’s enemies and
supported by internal seditionists.
In most cases, Iran uses cutout or proxy organizations, allowing it to keep some distance
from the disruptive incidents and propagandistic defacements. These cutouts represent
themselves as patriotic Iranians or pan-Islamic movements acting independently in defense
6/16

of the supreme leader, national sovereignty, and religious ideals. Conducting offensive cyber
operations through covert organizations provides Tehran plausible deniability for any attacks,
thereby protecting its claim to victimhood while also allowing the state to signal its intentions
to its opponents. These tactics are effective: there is still no definitive public agreement on
who was behind the Yemen Cyber Army’s attacks that led to stolen Saudi Arabian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs documents being published by WikiLeaks, with the consensus split between
Iran and Russia.56 The cutouts tend to develop their own mythology and continue to be
treated as active threats past their expiration date, bolstering perceptions of Iran’s capability.
Conducting offensive cyber operations through covert organizations provides Tehran
plausible deniability for any attacks, thereby protecting its claim to victimhood while
also allowing the state to signal its intentions to its opponents.
Nevertheless, a comprehensive study of Iran-linked cyber operations often reveals Tehran’s
hand in such proxies. When the U.S. Justice Department unsealed its Operation Ababil
indictment in March 2016, it named two Iranian corporate entities that employed at least
seven individuals who had been contracted by the Iranian government.57 The indictment
implicated three of the participants as being part of the Sun Army, an Iranian cutout
defacement group. The Sun Army followed the typical pattern found with the Iranian Cyber
Army and other state-aligned defacements, arising out of nowhere to perform targeted
political acts over a short life span. Its first documented defacements, in February 2010, were
of sites connected to now-detained opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi. The vandalism
accused him of being a traitor and was timed to blunt planned antigovernment street
protests.58
As Iran’s cybersecurity landscape has professionalized, some defacement groups have
sought to convert their infamy into corporate success. Based on the disclosure of personal
information about threat actors, there are indications that those engaged in Iranian offensive
cyber operations work within corporate entities (such as IT consultancies) or contractors of
Iranian security forces.59 For example, aspects of the Madi espionage campaign implicated
the Mortal Kombat Underground Security Team, a small Iranian group that has attempted to
sell spyware and other hacking tools since at least 2008.60 The frequent overlap of legitimate
digital commerce sites and servers used for intrusion campaigns is demonstrative of these
blurred lines—a company might simultaneously provide web design services for businesses
and hack for the government.61
The transition of amateur hackers into contractors for state security agencies is reflected in
basic qualities and patterns of life found across most threat actors. There are clear
indications that the threat actors documented are solely Iranians operating inside Iran, not
diaspora Iranians or non-Iranians. At the most basic level, they tend to follow the normal
patterns of life of office workers, being active during the Iranian workweek (Saturday through
Wednesday) and dormant during Iranian holidays, particularly the long holiday of Nowruz,
the Persian New Year.

Iranian threat actors have often used pornography as bait in their spearphishing
campaigns and display an irreverent sense of humor.
Disclosures of aliases and real names, which may be discoverable because of a disregard
for operational security due to insulation from repercussions or a lack of professionalism,
help reveal both the lives and the motivations of Iranian threat actors. While those behind the
groups may be nationalists or ideologically aligned with the regime, they do not appear to be
enrolled members of the military or security apparatus. These individuals and groups also
differ in social and religious predilections; some participants promote the use of narcotics
and trade pornography on personal social media, while others are devoutly religious and
embed Islamic references in malware code. Iranian threat actors have often used
pornography as bait in their spearphishing campaigns and display an irreverent sense of
humor.

Criteria for Independent Assessment of State Involvement
Campaigns conducted against dissidents and others inside Iran provide the most direct
evidence of government involvement. Whereas it can be difficult to trace the consequences
of foreign espionage, for those on the ground the implications are more direct and tangible.62
As a pattern builds between cyber operations and the offline actions of security forces, the
relationship between both becomes clearer.63 While these cases of collaboration are
discernible in only a few threat actors, the patterns support a broader narrative around the
intrusion ecosystem.64 Indications that Iranians undertaking offensive cyber operations are
associated with the government include the following:
The campaigns have been conducted based on information that appears to have been
provided by security agencies. In certain cases, the campaigns have been carried out
in coordination with government employees and in advance of the arrest of the target.
The targets of such operations align with the sensitivities of the Islamic Republic, and
certain individuals are targeted repeatedly by multiple threat actors over time.
Persistent and costly campaigns have been sustained against thousands of targets
without an apparent financial motive and without clear indication of the end use of the
data obtained by intrusion.
In rare cases, potential ties to the government are even disclosed by the participants
themselves. A malware developer associated with the Rocket Kitten group, Yaser Balaghi,
was identified by name based on a pseudonym found in the malware’s code. In a résumé
from 2013, Balaghi listed past information security projects and a history of conducting
hacking projects under contract to an otherwise unnamed “cyber-organization.”65 Balaghi is
not alone in listing his hacking activities on his résumé; still other pseudonyms embedded in
malware code used against Saudi Arabia and internal dissidents can be associated with
LinkedIn profiles describing their experience as an “Information Security Researcher” with a
“Secret” group.

8/16

To add a complication common in cybersecurity research, it is often difficult to distinguish
commonplace electronic fraud from politically motivated disruptions and state-sponsored
surveillance efforts, especially where the attacks are not sophisticated. In at least one case,
Iranians that had staged persistent attempts against U.S. foreign policy organizations and
two European foreign ministries had also maintained infrastructure linked with commercial
banking fraud.66 In another example, the same social engineering skills used by an individual
behind the Iranian Cyber Army defacements also proved successful in a career in the
commercial theft of domains and PayPal fraud. More recently, in an indictment against an
Iranian accused of attempting to extort HBO with stolen copies of unreleased television
episodes in the summer of 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice claimed that the same
individual had worked on behalf of the Iranian government to target military systems and
Israeli infrastructure.67
Analyses of Iranian offensive cyber operations often rest on the country’s strict domestic
controls as an indication of endorsement—that the government would not allow something to
happen that it didn’t want to occur. However, Tehran’s controls are not so absolute, and
many of the operations could occur surreptitiously given their simplicity. Cyber activity
emanating from Iran could theoretically be conducted without the state’s sanction, consent,
or even knowledge. Daily, millions of Iranians circumvent censorship using antifiltering tools
that allow them to bypass network restrictions and encrypt their communications against
surveillance. These tools provide space for Iranians to engage in actions against the
government without persecution, and similarly can conceal cyber activities. Therefore, an
Iranian origin does not alone indicate state sponsorship.
Nor does the financial damage resulting from an operation, the political implications of the
campaign, or the number of targets necessarily directly correlate with the probability of
government involvement. The destructive operations conducted against Saudi Aramco
resulted in millions of dollars in damages, yet the malware was unsophisticated and the
attack did not require significant resources, putting the incident plausibly within reach of a
sole individual acting without sponsorship. Such straightforward metrics of harm, then, are
poorly informative of the degree of governmental involvement in cyber activities originating
from Iran.

Government Entities and Threat Actors
The coordinated timing of cyber operations with politically motivated arrests are a strong
indication of the Iranian government’s direct involvement. Since at least July 2014 a pattern
has emerged: individuals in the custody of the IRGC are forced to provide access to their
online accounts and devices, which are then immediately used to conduct spearphishing
attacks associated with known threat actors.
A vivid example of this coordination is the case of Iranian-American Siamak Namazi, a fortysix-year-old Dubai-based energy consultant and previously a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars in Washington, DC. In October 2015, he was arrested by
9/16

Iranian security forces months after having had his passport confiscated while visiting the
country. Within hours of his arrest, Namazi’s Google and Facebook accounts initiated
conversations with his wide array of foreign policy and media contacts. The intruder,
pretending to be Namazi, sent contacts an article about the recent nuclear deal and in poor
English solicited edits on the document. This message was accompanied by an email
directing the target to a fake Google site requiring visitors sign in to their account to view the
document, a credential theft attempt connected to Rocket Kitten. Numerous individuals were
compromised in this campaign, including scholars, U.S. State Department employees, and
one prominent journalist whose Gmail account—which included communications with former
U.S. secretaries of state, CIA directors, and other foreign ministers—was overtaken by the
Iranian hackers for nearly two days. 68 This pattern has been repeated in numerous cases
involving other Iranians, dual nationals, and foreign nationals detained in Iran.
Cyber operations have also been documented in preparation for arrests.69 A prominent
example of target selection prior to arrest is the case of Babak Zanjani, an Iranian-Danish
businessman who had been personally sanctioned by the United States and European Union
for involvement in Iranian sanctions evasion. After months of claims regarding his role in the
embezzlement of oil revenue, a process that included a parliamentary investigation, at the
end of December 2013 Zanjani was arrested and subsequently charged with “corruption on
earth.”70 After an opaque judicial process, in March 2016 he was condemned to death, a
sentence the Ministry of Justice indicated could be commuted if Zanjani cooperated in
recovering Iran’s foreign assets.
This overarching trend points to probable relationships between certain threat actors
and the intelligence agencies, a business relationship that has been revealed when
Iranians have been indicted by the United States for hacking.
A persistent effort targeted Zanjani’s personal accounts and business infrastructure in the
weeks immediately preceding his arrest. Iranian threat actors sought access to Zanjani’s
iCloud services and successfully compromised employees associated with his holding
company, the Sorinet Group.71 These activities indicate that in advance of the arrest of
Zanjani, the group (Flying Kitten) had acquired access to the confidential information of
Sorinet subsidiaries and personnel; however, it is not clear whether any material accessed
during this time was used in the investigation or prosecution of Zanjani. The case of Zanjani
reflects a broader trend witnessed with other cases; Iranian threat actors frequently pursue
online the types of individuals commonly persecuted by the Islamic Republic offline.
The association between Iranian-origin cyber activities and Iran’s intelligence agencies is
further supported by the fact that the data acquired during such operations is rarely
disclosed. The Navy Marine Corps Intranet breach, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. incident, and
the compromise of State Department employees have all led to the exfiltration of substantial
amounts of highly sensitive information. There is no indication of ulterior motives, such as
fraud, extortion, humiliation, or disclosure to the hardline press.72 The operations required
costly infrastructure, including dedicated servers and dozens of domain names, in addition to
10/16

personnel time. The activities must have provided some degree of income to their members,
with the primary value being espionage. This overarching trend points to probable
relationships between certain threat actors and the intelligence agencies, a business
relationship that has been revealed when Iranians have been indicted by the United States
for hacking.

Notes
36 Ibid.
37 The tools and resources developed by Tehran have been almost uniformly described by

outside investigators as unsophisticated, particularly in comparison with malware produced
by other state and nonstate actors. The information security company Mandiant affirmed this
observation in a 2014 report: “Mandiant’s observations of suspected Iranian actors have not
provided any indication that they possess the range of tools or capabilities that are hallmarks
of a capable, full-scope cyber actor. They rely on publicly available tools and capitalize solely
on Web-based vulnerabilities—constraints that suggest these cyber actors have relatively
limited capabilities.” See: Mandiant, “M-Trends 2014 Annual Threat Report: Beyond the
Breach by Mandiant, a FireEye Company,” accessed December 5, 2017,
https://www2.fireeye.com/fireeye-mandiant-m-trends-report.
38 For example, former representative Peter Hoekstra speculated at a U.S. House hearing

that Iran’s advances in cyberwarfare came from the “cooperation they have with Russia.”
Other former and current officials have commented, often on background, that Russia was a
potential partner in warfare. For the subcommittee hearing on Iran’s support terrorism
worldwide, see the following: “Iran’s Support for Terrorism Worldwide,” Foreign Affairs
Committee, March 4, 2014, https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/joint-subcommitteehearing-irans-support-for-terrorism-worldwide/ . Elsewhere, claims have been made by
lesser known cybersecurity companies, but these analyses have been flawed and not well
accepted. For more on these flawed analyses, see: Collin Anderson, “Bears and Kittens, and

40 This could be either indicative of the ceiling of Iran’s capabilities or reflective of Iran not

facing the sort of existential threat that would provoke it to use any latent resources in its
arsenal. The former appears more likely.

41 Rocket Kitten and Flying Kitten are examples of how the line demarcating intrusion groups

is not always clear. The structural similarities of certain intrusion tools and the reuse of lesser
known infrastructure indicate that parts of Flying Kitten and Rocket Kitten may have had a
common heritage, including common members and shared tools; see: Collin Anderson,

53 The lack of clarity in the slides is also compounded by the age of the document and could

reflect an arrangement that is no longer in effect. However, within observations of activity,
there does appear to be a clustering of victims, with some samples of the malware agent
specifically used to compromise Lebanese and Qatari victims, but not Iranians or other
targets of exclusive interest to Iran.

Members of the infamous Ashiyane hacking community and others commonly broke into
Arabic media and U.S. government sites with political messages, such as protesting
alternative names for the Persian Gulf, Western perceptions of Islam, nuclear rights, the
administration of George W. Bush, and the crimes of other countries—often in broken
13/16

English and always bearing attribution. In a few cases these campaigns were sustained over
longer periods of time and were intended to make a point, especially when it came to Israeli
and Saudi targets. “Al Khaleej Newspaper Website Hacked,” Gulf News, March 7, 2017,

In its indictment, it even went as far as claiming that one individual had received relief from
mandatory military service in return for participation. United States of America v. Ahmad
Fathi et al., unsealed March 24, 2016, https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/834996/download. The
attribution for the campaigns and indication of the American intelligence community’s early
attribution of the participants are evident in screenshots from a presentation on the NSA’s
CyberCOP program from April 2013, which describes the scale of the DDoS attacks and the
infrastructure behind the botnet in its later phases of operation. See: “CyberCOP,”

61 Flying Kitten has also established Pars Security (Pars Pardazesh Hafez Shiraz). The FBI

had made similar allegations not only for the culprits of Operation Ababil, companies named
Mersad and ITSecTeam, but also in the Arrow Tech Associates theft. The FBI’s indictment
claims that two other individuals formed a company, Andisheh Vesal Middle East Company,
to steal software on behalf of the Iranian government. United States of America v.
Mohammed Saeed Ajily and Mohammed Reza Rezakhah, unsealed July 17, 2017,

For those on the ground the threats posed are more complex and multifaceted. For
example, Iranian telecommunications firms appear to have cooperated with the government
in order to provide access to the recovery and two-factor authentication codes sent by text.
These then allowed access to Google, Telegram, and other accounts on foreign platforms.
63

The most significant counterevidence of state-alignment is that when the Infy group was
disclosed by Palo Alto in May 2016, the domains used in the communications of the malware
were filtered by the censorship apparatus, blocking access to those victims. There are
explanations for this action that would not conflict with the theory that Infy was acting on
behalf of the government, including that the censorship was intended to hide evidence of the
operation from the Iranian public.
64

Specifically, we observed direct interactions between the Iranian state and the groups
Charming Kitten, Flying Kitten, Magic Kitten, and Rocket Kitten. More tenuous links exist for
Infy based on this criteria.

The incident was orchestrated by a threat actor who had registered domains under
cmprus1394[@]mail[.]ru and teymurov1984[@]gmail[.]com, which impacts a vast network of
espionage and criminal activity.

A dual national who had previously worked with a foreign broadcaster was arrested two
weeks after his email was also compromised after a phishing attempt. According to one
account, the attacker attempted to extract a ransom to keep the victim’s private information,
which was ignored. Then, after the arrest, the accounts were again used to target others.

These intrusions reflected a studied understanding of Sorinet’s operations and included
names such as “Baharak Zanjani” that appear on the corporate registrations of the
company’s subsidiaries but are believed to be false identities. See article in Persian, Young
Journalists Club, February 2, 2013,

Iranian security and intelligence agencies have however frequently used blackmail and
humiliation to intimidate or coerce individuals, including BBC Persian journalists. It is
possible that material compromised through intrusions has been used for political
manipulation, as this would be difficult to observe without acknowledgement from the victim.
