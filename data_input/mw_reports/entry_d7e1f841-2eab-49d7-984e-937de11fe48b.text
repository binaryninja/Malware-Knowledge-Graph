TAGGED: APAC, Elirks, Japan, PlugX, Scarlet Mimic

A recent, well-publicized attack on a Japanese business involved two malware families, PlugX
and Elirks, that were found during the investigation. PlugX has been used in a number of attacks
since first being discovered in 2012, and we have published several articles related to its use,
including an analysis of an attack campaign targeting Japanese companies.
Elirks, less widely known than PlugX, is a basic backdoor Trojan, first discovered in 2010, that is

primarily used to steal information from compromised systems. We mostly observe attacks using
Elirks occurring in East Asia. One of the unique features of the malware is that it retrieves its C2

address by accessing a pre-determined microblog service or SNS. Attackers create accounts on
those services and post encoded IP addresses or the domain names of real C2 servers in
advance of distributing the backdoor. We have seen multiple Elirks variants using Japanese blog

in early 2016.

Link to previous attack campaign
Unit 42 previously identified an Elirks variant during our analysis of the attack campaign called
Scarlet Mimic. It is years-long campaign targeting minority rights activists and governments. The

malware primarily used in this series of attacks was FakeM. Our researchers described the
threat sharing infrastructure with Elirks in the report.
As of this writing, we can note similarities between previously seen Elirks attacks and this recent
case in Japan.

When a user opened the attached PDF file, the following message is displayed. It exploits a
vulnerability in Adobe Flash, CVE-2011-0611 embedded in the PDF and installs Elirks malware
on the system.

Airline E-Ticket
Attackers choose a suitable file name to lure targeted individual or organization. In the recent
case, the malicious attachment name in the email was reported as “E-TKT”. We found similar
file name in the previous attack in Taiwan in August 2012 (Figure 5).

When opening the file, Elirks executes itself on the computer and creates ticket.doc to deceive

users (Figure 6).

We’ve also seen another file name related to aviation at Taiwan in March 2012. Figure 7 shows
PDF file named “Airline Reservation Numbers (updated version).pdf”. When opening the PDF
file, it displays the exactly same message with the Figure4, exploits CVE-2011-0611 and installs
Elirks.

Currently, we have found no reliable evidence to indicate the same adversary attacked a
company in Japan in 2016 and multiple organizations in Taiwan in 2012. However, we can see
some resemblances between the two attacks. In both cases, attackers used the same malware
family, crafted spear phishing emails in a similar manner, and seem to be interested in some
areas related to aviation. We have been seeing multiple Elirks variants targeting Japan in the
last few years, potentially indicating an ongoing cyber espionage campaign. We will keep an
eye on the threat actors.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from Elirks variant and can gather additional
information using the following tools:
