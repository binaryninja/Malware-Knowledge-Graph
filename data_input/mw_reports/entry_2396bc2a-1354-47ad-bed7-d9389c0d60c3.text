Malware authors are using simple but very effective approaches to stay low and steal user’s
data. SonicWall RTDMI ™ engine has recently detected Windows shortcut file (LNK) inside
an ISO image which downloads and executes LALALA infostealer to the victim’s machine.
LALALA infostealer is a batch script, which takes help of PowerShell to steal and send
victim’s data to the server:

1/8

The LNK file copies itself to “%TEMP%\ htn90.bat” and executes the batch script file. The
malware is intended to run only once on the victim’s machine. The batch script checks
presence of “%TEMP%\htn.txt” file, if already present then the batch script terminates and
deletes itself. The batch script writes “htn” into “%TEMP%\htn.txt”. The batch script
downloads an archive file “%TEMP%\htn.rar” and a WinRAR (compression tool) executable
file “%TEMP%\rar.exe” from Unified Resource Locator (URL) h[t]
[t]p://185.183.96.54/[filename].
The batch script extracts LALALA infostealer “htn.bat”, an image file
“lebenslauf_2019_11_20.jpeg” and an executable “sqlite3.exe” from “%TEMP%\htn.rar”
using WinRAR executable:

The batch script displays “lebenslauf_2019_11_20.jpeg” image to the user which contains
“ERROR 0x89976 IMAGE BROKEN” message, to make him feel that the LNK file has some
issues. The batch script then executes LALALA infostealer “%TEMP%\htn.bat”:

LALALA InfoStealer:
The malware creates directory “%TEMP%\jjghgjhfyt6” to store the stolen data. The
malware uses PowerShell command to collect and save installed programs information
into “%TEMP%\jjghgjhfyt6\proglist.txt”:

BACKDOOR ACTIVITY:
The malware opens a backdoor to the malware author by scheduling a task which executes
the VBScript “%TEMP%\[random].vbs” every minute. The VBScript takes web request
result from “185.183.96.54/gate990.php” as an argument and it contains the code to
execute the argument:

DATA EX-FILTRATION:
The malware usually process the data on victim’s machine to extract very precise
information which is sent to the malware server. But LALALA sends good amount of data to
the server which needs further processing at server’s end to extract the operative data. The
malware decrypts some application’s data (eg. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge) on
victim’s machine which uses Windows logon based encryption because that data can not
be decrypted on the other machine.
The malware steals login information from listed applications:
Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Microsoft Edge
Mozilla Thunderbird

Microsoft Outlook
The malware copies Chrome data files “cookies”, “Login Data” and “Web Data” from
“%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default” to “%TEMP%\jjghgjhfyt6\”. The
malware decrypts and saves card details, cookies and passwords
into “%TEMP%\jjghgjhfyt6\”:

The malware copies data files from Mozilla Thunderbird and Mozilla Firefox to
“%TEMP%\jjghgjhfyt6”:

The malware terminates “taskhost” and “dllhost” processes, then it decrypts and saves login
passwords from Microsoft Edge into “%TEMP%\jjghgjhfyt6\edg_[randome]”:

5/8

The malware decrypts and saves Outlook data into %TEMP%\jjghgjhfyt6\outloo_[random]:

NETWORK:
The malware compresses stolen data using WinRAR executable into “%TEMP%\
[random].rar” and sends the compressed file to “185.183.96.54/zit.php”. The malware
deletes the stolen data files and malware component files except “%TEMP%\htn.txt”:

The file is detected by only a few security vendors on popular threat intelligence sharing
portal VirusTotal at the time of writing this blog indicates its spreading potential:
