Email-based attacks are the most prominent threat vector that organizations see today. Like
any other form of communication, emails get exploited to become carriers for a wide variety
of attacks. Securing email nowadays means worrying about malicious attachments, links
leading to malware, links leading to phishing sites, and business email compromise attacks.
Due to their nature, those attacks are commonly perceived as threats external to the
organization. However, when the organization is already compromised, internal emails can
become a tool used by the attacker to move laterally through the organization. In some
cases, they are the stealthiest choice, as some organizations only perform security checks
against incoming emails.
The following analysis is a reconstruction of an attack on a manufacturing company with ties
to aerospace and defense industries.
Yosi and Idan both work for a compromised manufacturing company. Yosi, a mechanical
engineer, is sending an email to Idan. He is notifying his colleague about changes to their
helpdesk software. The email contains a short message about the documentation that he’s
attached.

When run through an automated language translation service, the message reads something
like this.

Sounds quite convincing. Since Idan trusts his coworker Yosi, he feels comfortable opening
the attachment. There’s no reason for Idan to suspect that Yosi isn’t the one sending him the
email. The email is sent from Yosi’s email address; it has the same reply-to address. Even if
Idan put in the extra effort to inspect the email headers, all he would see is that the email
was routed through the internal mail server.
However, that attachment is not a RAR archive despite its file extension. In reality, it is an
ACE archive - a format that WinRAR knows how to open. Within WinRAR, the ACE format
support is provided by a freeware library made by the WinACE authors.
That library has recently been found to be affected by a path traversal vulnerability - an issue
that allows an attacker to place a file in an arbitrary folder on the system. This vulnerability
can be used to place an executable file in just the right place for it to launch the next time the
machine powers up. That is exactly what the attachment is trying to do.
ReversingLabs A1000 visualizes the email headers and allows analysts to browse email
contents. Email attachments - when they are an archive - are extracted and displayed in a
view similar to one of an archive manager. The image below shows the contents of the ACE

archive Yosi sent to Idan.

The documentation that Yosi promised to Idan is certainly there. There’s lots of it, and it is
used to cover the fact that Yosi is not who he claims to be. The first folder in the list of files is
an indication that the attached ACE archive is exploiting the path traversal vulnerability assigned CVE-2018-20250.
Following the folder path all the way down, it is easy to see where the following executable
file is going to be extracted to.

Not only is the executable installed to the startup location, but it is also clear that this attack
is a highly personalized one. The path traversal only works because the absolute paths are
hardcoded to point to the user-specific startup folder. That makes the attack viable only for
the machine of the intended email recipient, Idan.
At this point, it is clear that the attacker has compromised the organization. That Yosi’s
credentials are in the hands of the attacker. That the recon phase of the attack has been
completed, and that the attacker is interested in moving laterally through the organization. It
is more than likely that the next target, Idan, has access or information that the attacker is
ultimately after.

The malicious executable the attacker expects to have successfully planted on Idan’s
machine reveals more about the who and the why.

While "Agent" is not a particularly interesting or indicative threat name produced by our
system, it is a starting point. It means that the threat itself isn’t particularly unique, and that it
shares at least some of the commonality with previously discovered trojans. This is where
functional code similarity can help. There is exactly one more file in the ReversingLabs cloud
system similar to the one we’re looking at.

That file has been classified as RisingSun Trojan by McAfee. The report which McAfee’s
Advanced Threat Research team published on the Operation Sharpshooter describes what
we’ve seen so far perfectly - an advanced attacker targeting the defense sector.

The suspicion that the attacks are connected is further supported by URLs extracted from
the relevant executable. They seem to follow the same pattern as described in McAfee’s
report.

A look at the executable hex dump also reveals a few striking similarities between the
attacks.

The email Yosi sent to Idan may very well be an indication of new activity for this APT actor.
While the infection techniques seem to have evolved since McAfee published their report in
December 2018, the methods of operation remained similar. The list of targets the actor is
interested in has apparently been expanded to a new region as well - Israel.
Scouring the web for additional information based on what’s been discovered at this point
reveals one more report published by the FireEye Threat Research team. They go into the
analysis of this same email, so it is recommended to read their report as a follow-up to our
discussion here.
Email is an important threat-carrying vector. Securing an organization's email infrastructure
mandates checking all emails received by the organization, whether they are coming from
the outside or from within. The ReversingLabs Titanium platform enables such deep
inspection with its elastic file processing capabilities. With our platform, the possibility of

checking every email message the organization sees becomes the norm. Deploying such a
capability within an organization could make the difference between catching the lateral
email movement and missing it altogether.
