DEWMODE Web Shell Used on
Accellion FTA Appliances

MALWARE/TOOL PROFILE

Key Judgments
• The Accellion FTA data breach was enabled by
4 zero-day vulnerabilities, with initial access
gained through an SQL injection vulnerability,
CVE-2021-27101.

This report provides a high-level overview of the Accellion File
Transfer Appliance compromise and analysis of the DEWMODE webshell
employed in the resulting breaches. Insikt Group used open source
research (OSINT), PolySwarm, malware analysis, and the Recorded
Future® Platform to execute this research. The target audience of this
research includes day-to-day security practitioners as well executive
decision-makers concerned about targeting of third-party systems and
software.

Executive Summary
The compromise of the Accellion File Transfer
Appliance (FTA) file sharing service impacting nearly 100
clients of the company was enabled primarily by 4 zeroday vulnerabilities in the tool that allowed threat actors
to place the DEWMODE web shell on victim servers
and exfiltrate files from those servers. As of February
25, 2021, 13 organizations in multiple sectors (finance,
government, legal, education, telecommunications,
healthcare, retail, and manufacturing) and multiple
countries (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, the UK,
and the US) have suffered data breaches as a result of
the Accellion FTA compromise. Victim data has appeared
on the website CL0P LEAKS, establishing a link between
the operators of this website and the attackers behind
the Clop ransomware. There are likely to be reports of
additional victims in the near future, and we suspect
that these victims will be part of additional industries
and countries beyond what have already been reported.
Clients using Accellion FTA in their environment are
advised to update the software to version FTA_9_12_416
or later and employ Insikt Group’s recommended
mitigations to look for related malicious behavior on
these servers.

• Based on the changes in statements from
Accellion over the course of reporting on this
campaign, the company may still not be fully
aware of the extent of compromise associated
with these vulnerabilities. Furthermore, based
on the number of industries and countries that
include clients of Accellion, we suspect that
future reports of Accellion FTA exploitation
will disclose more companies, industries, and
countries than have previously been reported.

Background
On January 10, 2021, the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand reported a data breach due to compromise
of a third-party file sharing service, shortly afterward
identified as Accellion. The bank released a statement
about the breach a day later, in which they stated that the
breach may have exposed commercially and personally
sensitive information. Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr
said it had been advised by Accellion that the Reserve
Bank was not specifically targeted and that other users
of Accellion FTA were also compromised.
Shortly afterward, on January 12, Accellion stated
in a press release that “less than 50 customers” were
affected by a “P0 vulnerability” in its legacy FTA
software. They further claimed that they first learned
of the vulnerability in mid-December 2020, and that
a patch was subsequently released “in 72 hours with
minimal impact”.

Threat Analysis
Within a few weeks after Accellion’s initial press release,
multiple other companies disclosed data breaches that occurred
due to exploitation of Accellion FTA. Additionally, data of victims
of Accellion FTA compromise began to appear on the website
CL0P LEAKS, establishing a link between the operators of this
website and the attackers behind the Clop ransomware. Based
on an updated number of potential victims disclosed by Accellion
on February 22, and an expanding list of victims up to the time
of writing (February 24), we expect additional similar reports to
appear over the next month. The following timeline tracks new
victim disclosures, security researcher analysis, and updates
from Accellion itself.
• January 22 — Australian law firm Allens reports a data
breach due to Accellion FTA compromise.
• January 25 — The Australian Securities and Investment
Commission discloses that on January 15, it became
aware of a data breach due to Accellion FTA compromise.
• February 2 — US law firm Goodwin Procter, the first
non-Australian or New Zealand victim, discloses a data
breach due to Accellion FTA compromise.
• February 4 — The Office of the US Washington State
Auditor discloses a data breach due to Accellion FTA
compromise.
• February 9 — Open sources report that the University
of Colorado suffered a data breach due to Accellion FTA
compromise.

• February 21 — Recorded Future data confirms the
appearance of Jones Day data on the CL0P LEAKS
website.
• February 22 — FireEye releases a blog detailing links
between the Accellion FTA breaches and a group known
as UNC2546, the cybercrime group FIN11, the operators
of the extortion site for data stolen via Clop ransomware
attacks, and a web shell called DEWMODE. On the
same day, Accellion releases a statement that “out of
approximately 300 total FTA clients, fewer than 100 were
victims of the attack”.
• February 23 — Canadian airplane manufacturer
Bombardier and Australian government agency Transport
for NSW disclose data breaches due to Accellion FTA
compromise.
• February 24 — Recorded Future logs data exposures
for Singtel and Bombardier on the CL0P Leaks website.
Five Eyes members issue a joint advisory regarding
ongoing attacks exploiting Accellion FTA vulnerabilities.
The advisory states that impacted organizations are in
“Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom
[from which no organizations have yet disclosed a data
breach], and the United States”. An open source report
discloses that US health insurance company Centene
is another victim of data breach due to Accellion FTA
compromise.

We anticipate that the countries identified by the Five Eyes
report and our research as hosting victims of Accellion FTA
compromise (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, the
UK, and the US) are and will continue to be the most impacted
by this series of attacks based on the distribution of victims
so far. However, we do not believe that these attacks are

based on narrow targeting of these countries. Additionally, as
the map below shows, there are several other countries that
host customers of Accellion (and therefore potential victims of
exploitation), including France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, and
the Netherlands.

to further exploit, these servers. It is not clear at this time
whether the threat actor found these vulnerabilities themselves,
which would suggest technical sophistication, or whether they
purchased them from another actor.

MALWARE/TOOL PROFILE

If the web shell receives a GET request with the key
“csrftoken” and value “11454bd782bb41db213d415e10a0fb3c”,
it will perform a cleanup of itself, which entails deletion of the
web shell from the server, and the writing of the command seen
in Figure 5 below (reformatted for clarity) to a temporary file at
/tmp/.scr. This script does the following:
• For each log in the server’s Apache logs located in /var/
opt/apache, put all lines not containing references to
“about.html” (as noted by the -v parameter to grep) into
a temporary file, located at /tmp/x. Overwrite the original
logfile with this temporary file, and delete the temporary
file.

Vulnerabilities Used in Breach
Four vulnerabilities were cited in association with the
Accellion FTA data breach, specifically CVE-2021-27101, CVE2021-27102, CVE-2021-27103 and CVE-2021-27104.

CVE-2021-27101
RF Risk Score( 79 :High)
NIST Base Score( 9.8 :Critical)
Description :This vulnerability is an SQL injection
via a crafted Host header in a request to document_
root.html that was exploited to enable initial access to
Accellion FTA servers .It affects software versions FTA
370_12_9and earlier.

• Overwrite the contents of adminpl.log with nothing.
• Remove the DEWMODE web shell (about.html) and the
eval web shell (oauth.api) and redirect the output to /
tmp/.out (to prevent logging).
• Allow anyone to read, write or execute /tmp/.out and set
the owner to “nobody” to obfuscate who created the file.

Mitigation :Update Accellion FTA software to
version FTA 380_12_9_or later.

CVE-2021-27104

The attacker’s cleanup procedure associated with the
DEWMODE web shell is fairly thorough, even adjusting the logs
that could indicate malicious behavior associated with the web
shell. Additionally, rather than fully deleting these logs, which
would likely look suspicious to a system administrator, the threat
actor modifies the logs to remove the lines with “about.html” in
them. However, depending on how long the threat actor spent
between the deployment of the web shell and the cleanup, if
the organization is exporting or otherwise saving the log files
to another location, references to “about.html” would remain
in those egressed logs, allowing for incident response efforts.

Mitigations
While TTPs used in the Accellion breach and in association
with the DEWMODE web shell have become widely publicized,
and threat actors may modify them to evade detection, Insikt
Group advises the following mitigations:

• Organizations should monitor for network requests
associated with the DEWMODE web shell, including:
• GET requests to /about.html?dwn=[encrypted
path]&fn=[encrypted filename]
• GET requests to /about
tml?csrftoken=11454bd782bb41db213d415e10
a0fb3c

• Monitor third-party risk to your organization from this
campaign. Potential monitoring parameters can include
publicly reported cyberattacks against companies that
use Accellion FTA, new references to leaked data on
the CL0P LEAKS website, and threat groups or malware
associated with UNC2546, FIN11, or Clop ransomware.
• Accellion has released patches for all of the
vulnerabilities associated with this breach, and
organizations using Accellion FTA servers should update
to version FTA_9_12_416.

• GET requests to /about.html?aid=1000
• According to CISA, there was an incident in which
a large amount of data was exfiltrated on port 443
to 194.88.104[.]24 and another in which several
TCP sessions had IP address 45.135.229[.]179.
• The following file system events were associated with
the breach:
• Creation of “about.html” in /home/seos/courier or /
home/httpd/html

• If a system is running Accellion FTA, consider
isolating the system from the internet until
patches can be applied.

• Writes to the file /courier/oauth.api, where data
contained matches the description of the eval
shell, above

• If malicious behavior is identified, CISA
recommends resetting the “W1” encryption token
and any other security tokens on the system.
• Accellion’s FTA product will be reaching end of
life on April 30, 2021. Clients using the product
should consider alternative options for file-sharing
platforms to migrate to as the EOL approaches for
FTA.
If your organization was running a vulnerable version
of Accellion FTA, an incident response investigation should
be undertaken to determine whether there was a breach.
The following methods may be used to examine log data for
indications of a compromise.

www.recordedfuture.com | Recorded Future ®

• Accesses to /courier/document_root.html, or /
courier/sftp_account_edit.php
• Several modifications to logs contained in the
Apache log directory, /var/opt/apache
• While other researchers have linked this threat activity
with varying degrees of confidence to the threat actors
behind Clop ransomware, Insikt Group does not have
enough information to confirm or refute this.

Outlook
Based on the changes in statements from Accellion over
the course of reporting on this campaign, the company may
still not be fully aware of the extent of compromise associated
with these vulnerabilities. Furthermore, based on the number
of industries and countries that include clients of Accellion, we
suspect that future reports of Accellion FTA exploitation will
disclose more companies, industries, and countries than have
previously been reported.
As products approach end of life, such as Accellion FTA,
they are likely to have less developer support, and update
oversight moving forward. Organizations with software or
hardware in their technology stack that has reached end of life
or is approaching it should continue to monitor these products
and develop migration strategies for these tools to more current,
supported tools.
