During the back half of 2021, INKY began detecting phishing emails that impersonated the
United States Department of Labor (DoL). Eventually, the campaign grew to hundreds of
instances.
INKY caught enough of these attempts to do a thorough analysis of the campaign, which is
set out in this edition of Fresh Phish.

Quick Take: Attack Flow Overview

1/10

Type: Phishing
Vector: Spoofed DoL senders and newly created look-alike domains
Payload: Malicious links in PDF attachments leading to credential harvesting sites
Techniques: Brand impersonation, mail server abuse, VIP impersonation
Platform: Google Workspace and Microsoft 365
Target: Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 users

The Attack
In this campaign, the majority of phishing attempts had sender email addresses spoofed to
look as if they came from no-reply@dol[.]gov, which is the real DoL site. A small subset was
spoofed to look as if they came from no-reply@dol[.]com, which is, of course, not the real
DoL domain.
The rest came from a set of newly created look-alike domains:
dol-gov[.]com
dol-gov[.]us
bids-dolgov[.]us

Distribution of spoofed domains

These phishing emails invited recipients to submit bids for “ongoing government projects"
and claimed to be from a senior DoL employee responsible for procurement.

Email impersonating the U.S. DoL
Each phishing email had a three-page PDF attachment (shown below) with well-crafted DoL
branding elements.

Recipients were instructed to click the “BID” button on Page 2 to access DoL’s procurement
portal. Behind the button was a malicious link. The links varied, but they all led to malicious
domains that impersonated the DoL.
Here are the variants INKY detected:
opendolbid[.]us
usdol-gov[.]com
bid-dolgov[.]us
us-dolbids[.]us
dol-bids[.]us
openbids-dolgov[.]us
open-biddolgov[.]us
openbids-dolgov[.]com
usdol-gov[.]us
dolbids[.]com
openbid-dolgov[.]us
dol[.]global
What the victim saw when they reached the evil site was a set of fake instructions.

When the victim closed the instructions, what they saw was an identical copy of the real DoL
website. The clever phishers had simply copied HTML and CSS from the real site and
pasted it into the phishing site.

Identical copy of DoL site (except for red “Click here to bid” button)
Victims who clicked on the red “Click here to bid” button was presented with a credential
harvesting form with instructions to sign in and bid using a Microsoft or other business email
account.

Credential harvesting form
When an INKY engineer made the first attempt at entering fake credentials, the site
displayed a fake incorrect credentials error. But behind the scenes, those fake credentials
had already been harvested (and either stored on the malicious site or emailed to the
phisher).

Fake incorrect credentials error
In a classic “blow-off,” when our engineer made a second attempt at entering fake
credentials, they were redirected to the real DoL site. This nuanced touch, borrowed from
con artistry that well predates the digital era, is designed to confuse the victim and delay the
moment when they realize that they were taken.

Techniques
In the majority of these attacks (the ones in which the spoofed sender was either noreply@dol[.]gov or no-reply@dol[.]com), the phishers were able to send their phishing emails
from abused servers nominally controlled by a non-profit professional membership group.

Received headers of a phish sent on New Year's Day

In this example’s received headers (the path of servers through which the email travelled),
the email originated from 185.105.7.219, and the non-profit’s abused mail server accepted it
before passing it off to Microsoft Outlook servers. This technique allowed the phishing email
to receive a DKIM pass for the reputable group’s domain. An investigation into
185.105.7.219 revealed that the IP address was associated with albacasino[.]com, a new
domain created barely a week prior.
In other cases, the phishers used newly created domains to both send initial phishing emails
and host fake DoL sites. Newly created domains are a black-hat favorite because they are
able to pass standard email authentication (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC). Since they are brand
new, the domains represent zero-day vulnerabilities; they have never been seen before and
typically do not appear in threat intelligence feeds commonly referenced by legacy antiphishing tools. Without a blemish, these sites used in this exploit did not look malicious.

A WHOIS lookup surfaced a recently created phishing domain
Although several email security vendors use computer vision to detect impersonation sites,
simplistic computer vision would not have helped in this case because the first thing the
victim saw was the instructions, which concealed the actual impersonated site.

Recap of Techniques
Brand impersonation — is done seamlessly by phishers who copy and paste HTML
and CSS directly from the real DoL site to spoof it
Abuse of a mail server — leverages a legitimate organization’s mail server to send
phishing emails
Newly created domains — are not yet known by threat intelligence feeds and
therefore pass rudimentary security checks
Credential harvesting — occurs when a victim tries to log into what they think is a real
government site and ends up instead entering credentials into a form controlled by the
phishers

Best Practices: Guidance and Recommendations
Official U.S. government domains usually end in .gov or .mil rather than .com or another
suffix.
The U.S. government does not typically send out cold emails to solicit bids for projects.
Potential victims should be aware that it makes no sense to be asked to log in with email
credentials to view a document on a completely different network.
For message administrators, it ought to be clear that SMTP servers should not be configured
to accept and forward emails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by
unauthenticated and unauthorized users.
