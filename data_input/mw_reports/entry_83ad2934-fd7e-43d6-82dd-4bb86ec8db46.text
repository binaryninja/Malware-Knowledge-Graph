A few years ago public RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) offerings were plentiful. SATAN,
Nemesis, Petya, RaaSberry, Shark, Data Keeper…the list goes on. However, the trend,
especially in the last year, has been for these services to become increasingly exclusive.
NEMTY Revenue & Zeppelin are two prime examples of this.
Still, every now and then we stumble across a fully public service. It gets even more
interesting when that service offers a “seamless” experience across OS platforms.
Ransomware families with full feature parity across Windows, Linux and macOS do not pop
up all that often, which brings us to today’s topic: the SMAUG RaaS (Ransomware as a
Service) offering.

SMAUG’s Differentiators
The SMAUG RaaS emerged towards the end of April 2020, and seems to have gained some
traction in the following months. SMAUG appears to be a robust and full-service RaaS, with
a few tweaks that set it apart from the others.
Criminals who wish to become SMAUG “distributors” will likely be used to the offerings
associated with this type of service. The SMAUG operators currently charge a 20% service
fee. However, there is also a registration fee which is quite steep when compared to other
1/10

“fully-public” services. The current registration fee is .2 BTC, around $1800 USD at today’s
prices.
There are some possible exceptions to getting around the registration fee. On some forums
where SMAUG is advertising, the developers state that free memberships (owing only the
service fees) will be given to the first five customers with a certain number of posts, and the
ability to prove their past work (attacks).

Perhaps the most interesting differentiators are multi-platform support (all 64-bit) and the
inclusion of a “Company Mode”, which allows for a single key to apply to an entire body of
infected ‘hosts’ (aka a targeted company). If the victim chooses to comply with the attackers,
then a single key can be used to decrypt (theoretically) all the encrypted hosts in that
environment.

SMAUG also has offline capabilities, meaning that the payload does not have to have any
amount of connectivity in order to execute and encrypt.

SMAUG is designed to evade traditional AV products. Along with crypting/obfuscation, the
payloads have been developed to have as minimal a footprint as possible.
It should be noted that SMAUG does not appear to include a native crypting/packing feature.
Consequently, the developers advise attackers to further obfuscate their payloads. They note
the following within the Campaign configuration options of the SMAUG management
interface: “Even though the payload is stealthy it is recommended to use crypting service to
ensure the payload is undetectable by antivirus solutions.”

The operators advertise a fully automated payment system, as well as highly customizable
campaigns. This allows attackers to streamline and organize multiple campaigns within the
management interface.

Most RaaS operators offer a high level of “support” for their affiliates, and this one is no
different. SMAUG offers full support for both their customers and victims.

Customizable Malware, But Mind Your Targets
In SMAUG’s service advertisements, they state “Infecting CIS is forbidden and will result in a
ban” In this context, CIS is the ‘Commonwealth of Independent States’ aka the group of
independent countries that were once part of the Soviet Union.
Campaigns created by SMAUG are, as stated, fully customizable, allowing attackers to set
their desired price (BTC), deadline/timing constraints, as well as the actual ransom note’s
message.
SMAUG-generated malware is designed to execute extremely fast. They tout this as follows:
“The payload utilizes multi-threaded native code which ensures the encryption is done before
your victims can react to it.”

Payloads are generated directly in SMAUG’s web-based management interface. While many
RaaS offerings provide their own offline builder, this can often complicate the process, and
lead to issues for the aspiring attackers. SMAUG works around this with their “simple web
UI”. Victims are able to submit a single file for decryption for free. Beyond that, they must
comply with the ransom demands as set in the campaign.

Individual files are encrypted via AES-256. An RSA-2048 public key is used to encrypt the
AES encryption key.

Go Payloads
The SMAUG payloads for Windows are obfuscated Go binaries. With that in mind, these
payloads begin to bear a resemblance to other similar Ransomware services (ex: Project
Root).

Upon launch the malware will drop a copy of itself into a local driver directory, such as:
C:WindowsSysWOW64drivers
C:WindowsSystem32drivers

The malware will then attempt to establish persistence via LoadAppInit_DLLs key in the
registry. For example,
HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWindowsLoadAppInit_DLLs

The SMAUG payloads contain additional functionality to gather system information and
stored browser credentials. Encryption is achieved via simple AES-256, again similar to
Project Root and other Go-based ransomware services. Upon encryption, affected files will
have a lengthy extension added (e.g., 11bdd939-1d45-421c-9be0-0addcdc8181c )

6/10

A ransom note is deposited in all directories containing encrypted files. In our analyzed
example, the dropped ransom note was simply named “HACKED.TXT” with the following
contents:
“Your files have been encrypted using military grade encryption. They can never be
accessed again without buying a decryption key. You can buy the decryption key at
http://[redacted].onion. To access the site you need Tor Browser.
to view site you can download torbrowser here – https://www.torproject.org/download/
need help?support [redacted]@secmail.pro”

Victims are instructed, via the ransom note, to visit SMAUG’s onion-based portal for payment
instructions and processing.

Oddly enough, SMAUG appears to have one of the most “helpful” payment (aka extortion)
portals we have seen. Their walkthroughs (for both victims and affiliates) are very thorough:

Conclusion
Protecting your environment against threats like SMAUG is more critical than ever. In order
to prevent loss of data and the consequences of a large-scale data breach, organizations
must rely on a modern, well maintained, and properly-tuned and trusted security solution.
Prevention is key with these attacks. Even in the event that the encryption/data-loss can be
mitigated through decryptors, backups or rollbacks, victims still face the problem of their data
being posted publicly. We encourage security teams to analyze and understand the threats
and to take swift and appropriate action to prevent incidents occurring in the first place.
