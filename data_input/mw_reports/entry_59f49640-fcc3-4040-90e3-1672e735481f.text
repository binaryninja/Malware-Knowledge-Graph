TTPs: Malware Modularity

§ Rise in modular malware cases, mostly
attributed to APT41
§ Other actors consistent:

– APT10, dissident targeting in South East Asia

TTPs: Supply Chain & Execution Guardrails
§ In June 2018, a utility to update ASUS
computers was compromised

– Kaspersky reported more than 50,000 systems
installed the malicious update

§ Guardrail #1:
– Utilized MAC address whitelisting to limit
download & execution of 2nd stage malware
(APT41 POISONPLUG)

§ Guard rail #2:
– POISONPLUG sample matches C: drive volume
serial number to limit execution to 1 system

Google Docs
(embedded C&C command)

§ PII was the most commonly
observed type of data stolen

§ IT data was stolen as well
§ Military application IP theft
continues

§ No direct evidence of theft of IP
with purely commercial
applications
