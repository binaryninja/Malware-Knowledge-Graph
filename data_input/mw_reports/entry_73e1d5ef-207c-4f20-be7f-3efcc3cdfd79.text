The creator of the Osiris banking trojan has shut down its operation in March, citing a lack of
interest for banking trojans in the cybercriminal underground.
The shutdown announcement was posted in a hacking forum thread where the Osiris author,
an individual named Anubi, initially started advertising the trojan back in April 2018.

For the past three years, Anubi has been providing copies of the Osiris banker to cybercrime
groups, which have been distributing them using email spam campaigns to victims all over
the world.
The trojan, which is a revamped and improved version of the Kronos malware (2014), is a
classic banking trojan that infects Windows computers and then injects malicious code in
web browsers to steal e-banking credentials and alter banking transactions.
According to an analysis by security firm Check Point, the trojan also employed advanced
rootkits to get a permanent foothold inside infected hosts and could also steal credentials
from multiple local apps, data that it later sent to a command and control (C&C) server via
the Tor protocol.

But in an interview today with The Record, malware analyst 3xp0rt, who spotted the Osiris
retirement post, said the shutdown announcement comes as the banking trojan has been
seeing less and less usage among cybercriminal groups.
The last major spam campaign distributing a version of the Osiris trojan was spotted in
January this year, targeting German users, the researcher said.
Since then, new Osiris campaigns have been rare, although some of Anubi’s former
customers appear to continue using it in some smaller-scale operations.
While the Osiris source code has not been leaked online, 3xp0rt told The Record that they
believe that some of the malware’s former clients will eventually resell it in second-market
backroom deals as they stop using it for their own attacks and move to newer codebases.

New Kronos-variant spotted as Osiris died
But just as Anubi was announcing the Osiris retirement, security firm Zscaler also reported
about a new banking trojan named Ares that was based on the old Kronos codebase and
shared different components and similarities with the Osiris trojan.

Currently, it is unclear if Anubi is involved in the creation of this new trojan or if they handed
over the codebase to a new developer who has now put their own spin on this dangerous
malware.
Either way, the connections between the three malware strains are more than evident,
although, according to Zscaler researchers, the Ares code is in early stages of development.
“The code contains several bugs and unreferenced code segments that are likely used for
debugging purposes,” they said. “The threat actor has invested significant resources in
building DarkCrypter, BMPack, Ares, and Ares Stealer. Therefore, activity related to this
threat is likely to increase as the malware continues to mature.”
