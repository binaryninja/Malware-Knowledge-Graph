While some financially motivated scams may seem simple on the surface, the truth of the
matter is that cybercriminals are investing large amounts of money into strategies and
infrastructure to scale up their malicious campaigns. Those investments are paying off as
threat actors continue to target mobile users with successful campaigns.
In October, the Zimperium zLabs team informed the community about GriftHorse, a massive
mobile premium service abuse campaign that compromised around 10 million victims
globally. In the pursuit of identifying and taking down similar financially motivated scams,
zLabs researchers have discovered another premium service abuse campaign with
upwards of 105 million victims globally, which we have named Dark Herring. The total
amount of money scammed out of unsuspecting users could once again be well into the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
These malicious Android applications appear harmless when looking at the store
description and requested permissions, but this false sense of confidence changes when
users get charged month over month for premium service they are not receiving via direct
carrier billing. Direct carrier billing, or DCB, is the mobile payment method that allows
consumers to send charges of purchase made to their phone bills with their phone number.
Unlike many other malicious applications that provide no functional capabilities, the victim
can use these applications, meaning they are often left installed on the phones and tablets
long after initial installation.
Threat intelligence on the active Dark Herring Android Scamware campaign revealed that
the date of publication of the apps dates back to March 2020. To date, Dark Herring is the
longest-running mobile SMS scam discovered by the Zimperium zLabs team.
These malicious applications were initially distributed through both Google Play and thirdparty application stores. Zimperium zLabs reported the findings to both Google and the web
hosts, who verified the provided information and removed the malicious materials as part of
a coordinated takedown. At the time of publishing, the scam services and phishing
sites are no longer active, and Google has removed all the malicious applications
from Google Play.

However, the malicious applications are still available on third-party app repositories, once
again highlighting the risk of sideloading applications to mobile endpoints and the need for
advanced on-device security.
Disclosure: As a key member of the Google App Defense Alliance, Zimperium scans
applications before they are published and provides an ongoing analysis of Android
apps in the Google Play Store.
In this blog, we will:
Cover the capabilities of the scamware;
Discuss the architecture of the applications;
Show the communication with the C&C server; and
Explore the global impact of this campaign.

Summary of Dark Herring Android Scamware
The Dark Herring mobile applications pose a threat to all Android devices by functioning as
a scamware that subscribes users to paid services, charging an average monthly premium
of $15 USD per month. This campaign has targeted millions of users from over 70 countries
by serving targeted malicious web pages to users based on the geo-location of their IP
address with the local language. This social engineering trick is exceptionally successful
and effective as users are generally more comfortable with sharing information to a website
in their local language.
Upon infection, the Dark Herring-infected application communicates with the C&C server,
exposing the victim’s IP address. Based on the geolocation of the IP address, the decision
to target the victim for Direct Carrier Billing subscription or not is taken by using server-side
logic. The malware redirects the victim to a geo-specific webpage where they are asked to
submit their phone numbers for verification. But in reality, they are submitting their phone
number to a Direct Carrier Billing service that begins charging them an average of $15 USD
per month. The victim does not immediately notice the impact of the theft, and the likelihood
of the billing continuing for months before detection is high, with little to no recourse to get
one’s money back.
The threat actors responsible for Dark Herring generated and published almost 470
applications on the Google Play Store over a long period, with the earliest submission
dating to March 2020 and as recently as November 2021. The number of applications
attributed to this campaign indicates that the motivated and persistent threat actors are
continuously scaling up their architecture and resources to infect as many victims as
possible to maximize their gains.
Zimperium zLabs researchers have noticed a pattern in the C&C communication, which
suggests that the threat actors have developed an infrastructure to handle the
communication coming from several applications with unique identifiers and responding
2/14

accordingly.
The download statistics reveal that more than 105 million Android devices had this
scamware installed, potentially falling victim to this campaign globally, possibly suffering
incalculable financial losses. The cybercriminal group behind this campaign has built a
stable cash flow of illicit funds from these victims, generating millions in recurring revenue
each month, with the total amount stolen potentially well into the hundreds of millions.

How does the Dark Herring Android Scamware work?
Once the Android application is installed and launched, a URL that acts as the first-stage
endpoint is loaded into a webview. The URL can be retrieved from a hard-coded string, the
resource strings, or decrypting a string. The first-stage URL is always an endpoint hosted
on Cloudfront. The initial GET request sent to the Cloudfront URL is shown in Figure 1.

Figure.1: The GET request to first-stage URL containing the application’s package name
The response contains the links to JavaScript files hosted on AWS instances, and the
application fetches all the resources to proceed with the infection process, as shown in
Figure.2.
One of such JS files instructs the application to get a unique identifier for the device by
making a POST request to the “live/keylookup” API endpoint and then constructing a finalstage URL.

The baseurl variable, as seen in Figure 3, is used to make a POST request that contains
unique identifiers created by the application to identify the device and the language and
country details.

The response from the above endpoint contains the configuration for the application’s
behavior based on the victim’s details. A list of supported countries is found in the response
that indicates the targeted citizens of countries will be subject to subscription of the Direct
Carrier Billing.

The Threat Actors

10/14

Despite the similarities in approach between this campaign and GriftHorse, the Zimperium
zLabs researchers have attributed this campaign to a new group of threat actors unaffiliated
with the GriftHorse attackers. Several differences in the core codebase and other indicators
are unique to this campaign, along with infrastructure investments not seen before. The
level of sophistication, use of novel techniques, and determination displayed by the threat
actors has allowed them to have such a large distribution around the world.
The Dark Herring campaign is one of the most extensive and successful malware
campaigns by measure of the sheer number of applications that the zLabs threat research
team has witnessed in 2021. Its success is attributed mainly to the rarely seen combination
of several features:
Novel techniques undetected by any other AV vendors
Around 470 scamware applications were used in the campaign
Use of proxies as first-stage URLs
The geolocation of the users based on IP is used to identify potential victims.
Vetting of application users to identify potential victims
Using a sophisticated architecture to obfuscate the true intent
Producing a large number of malicious applications and submitting them to app stores
points to an extensive, concerted effort by a well-organized group. These apps are not just
clones of each other or other apps but are uniquely produced at a high rate to deceive
traditional security toolsets and the potential victims.
The commonality of the malicious code and where the apps connect to it is more often than
not the only common facet among the over 470 applications. The evidence also points to a
significant financial investment from the malicious actors in building and maintaining the
infrastructure to keep this global scam operating at such a high pace.
In addition to over 470 Android applications, the distribution of the applications was
extremely well-planned, spreading their apps across multiple, varied categories, widening
the range of potential victims. The apps themselves also functioned as advertised,
increasing the false sense of confidence.

The Victims of Dark Herring Scamware
The campaign is exceptionally versatile, targeting mobile users from 70+ countries by
changing the application’s language and displaying the content according to the current
user’s IP address. Due to the nature of Direct Carrier Billing, some countries might have
been targeted with less success than others due to the consumer protections set in place
by telcos. Based on the collected intel, the Zimperium zLabs team estimates that Dark
Herring has attempted to infect over 105 million devices since March 2020. In the map
below, 70 countries have been identified with targeted victims. In the map below, nations
highlighted in red have the highest risks to victims due to the lack of consumer protects
from these types of Direct Carrier Billing scams.
