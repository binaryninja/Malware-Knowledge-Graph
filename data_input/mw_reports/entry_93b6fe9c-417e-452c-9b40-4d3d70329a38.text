A ransomware named SunCrypt has joined the 'Maze cartel,' and with their membership,
we get insight into how these groups are working together.
In June, we broke the story that the Maze threat actors created a cartel of ransomware
operations to share information and techniques to help each other extort their victims.
When first started, this cartel included Maze and LockBit, but soon expanded to include
Ragnar Locker.
When Maze first formed this group, they refused to answer our questions on how members
of their cartel benefited, and if there was a monetary benefit to Maze.

SunCrypt joins the Maze ransomware cartel

1/8

In an email sent to BleepingComputer, the operators of a ransomware named SunCrypt
stated that they are a new member of the Maze Ransomware cartel.
Based on submissions statistics to ID-Ransomware, this ransomware family began
operating in October 2019, but was not very active.
SunCrypt told BleepingComputer that they are an independently run ransomware operation
from Maze, but as part of the cartel, they have "two-way communication channels with
them,"
When asked why they joined this 'cartel,' we were told that Maze could not handle the
volume and needed outside help.
"They just can't handle all the available field of operations. Our main specialization is
ransomware attacks," - SunCrypt ransomware operators.
After further questions, they eventually told us that they "share revenue from the successful
operation," but did not provide any details about what Maze provided to earn that revenue
share.
Based on their statement that they were brought in because Maze can't handle all of the
potential attacks, Maze may provide compromised network access to cartel members in
exchange for a revenue share.
From a ransomware sample seen by BleepingComputer, it looks like cartel members get
more for their money.

Maze shares its resources with cartel members
Yesterday, GrujaRS was finally able to find a sample of the SunCrypt ransomware so we
can get a better glimpse into how the ransomware works.
The SunCrypt Ransomware sample is installed via a heavily obfuscated PowerShell script,
shown below.

Obfuscated PowerShell script
When the ransomware is executed, it will connect to the URL http://91.218.114[.]31 and
transmit information about the attack and its victim.
The use of this IP address provides another big clue as to what services the Maze threat
actors provide their cartel members.
For months, Maze has been hosting a data leak site and launching attacks from known
public IP addresses. Yet in all this time, their services remain intact and have not been
taken down by law enforcement.
The 91.218.114.31 address is one of the addresses that the Maze operation uses as part of
its campaign. Even more similar, Maze infections also transmit information to this IP
address during an attack.
This shared IP address means one of the two things; Maze is sharing their infrastructure or
white-labeling their ransomware technology to other groups.
This sharing of resources would also explain why they would earn a revenue share for each
ransom payment.

Update 8/31/2020: The Maze threat actors have told BleepingComputer that they are not
affiliated with the SunCrypt ransomware operators.
"We do not have any connections with SunCrypt, it is a lie."
"We do not know why SunCrypt does it, but we believe it is a PR strategy, to send links to
companies in chat that they are working with us as a pressure," Maze told
BleepingComputer.
Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez has told BleepingComputer that in addition to connecting to
http://91.218.114[.]31, the SunCrypt ransomware will also connect to http://91.218.114[.]30.
Both of these IP addresses are on the same address space.
As previously stated, 91.218.114[.]31 has been used by Maze in the past.
SunCrypt is no longer responding to our queries with follow up questions.

The SunCrypt Ransomware
The SunCrypt ransomware itself is still being analyzed, but we can provide a basic overview
of the ransomware.
The ransomware is currently being distributed as a DLL that, when executed, will encrypt a
computer's files.
When encrypting files, it will append a hexadecimal hash to the end of each file name. It is
not known what this hash represents.

SunCrypt encrypted files
In every folder a ransom note named YOUR_FILES_ARE_ENCRYPTED.HTML is created
that contains information on what happened to a victim's files and a link to the Tor payment
site.

5/8

SunCrypt ransom note
The Tor link enclosed in a ransom note is hardcoded into the ransomware executable. This
means that every victim encrypted by a particular SunCrypt executable will have the same
Tor payment site link.
The Tor payment site does not have automated features and simply contains a chat screen
where a victim can negotiate a ransom with the SunCrypt threat actors.
Furthermore, every ransom note contains a link to the SunCrypt data leak site that the
threat actors warn will be used to publish the victim's data.

6/8

SunCrypt data leak site
At this time, there are approximately five victims listed on the SunCrypt data leak site.
Other ransomware operations that run data leak sites or have stolen unencrypted files to
extort their victims include Ako, Avaddon, Clop, Conti, CryLock, DoppelPaymer, Maze,
MountLocker, Nemty, Nephilim, Netwalker, Pysa/Mespinoza, Ragnar Locker, REvil,
Sekhmet, Snatch, and Snake.
SunCrypt is currently being analyzed for weaknesses, and it is not known if it is possible to
recover files for free.
Update 8/31/20: The Maze operators deny having any affiliation with SunCrypt.
