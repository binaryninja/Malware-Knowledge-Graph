Yet Another Archive Format Smuggling Malware
trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/another-archive-format-smuggling-malware/

The use of novel disk image files to encapsulate malware distributed via spam has been a
theme that we have highlighted over the past couple of years. As anticipated, we have seen
more disk image file formats being used, in addition to .ISO, .IMG, and .DAA which we
blogged about.
We recently spotted another file format being used. These spams, spoofing courier
companies, contain a malicious WIM (Windows Imaging Format) file disguised as an
invoice or consignment note. WIM is a file-based disk image format developed by Microsoft.
The file format serves to deploy Windows software components and updates ever since
Windows Vista. This format uses a ".wim" extension and its content can be extracted using
archiving tools like 7Zip, PowerISO, and PeaZip. Below are some samples from this
campaign.

The attachments, although they have a ‘.wim.001’ file extension which denotes that they are
the first part of a larger WIM file, have the complete file structure of a WIM file. Using the
ImageX tool, we verified that all the WIM attachments we collected are not compressed and
have one file only.

Opening the WIM files in a hex editor, its immediately noticeable that an executable file is
hiding in them. Using the archiving tool 7Zip as displayed in Fig. 3, the EXE file bearing the
same name as its WIM container can be extracted.

All the WIM files we gathered from our samples contain Agent Tesla malware. This threat is
a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) written in .Net which can take full control over a
compromised system and can exfiltrate data via HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and Telegram. In 2020,
Agent Tesla was one of the predominant RATs and early this year, we reported that this
malware is still actively getting distributed in spam emails.

Summary
Encapsulating malware in an unusual archive file format is one of the common ways to
bypass gateways and scanners. However, this strategy also poses a hurdle – the target
system must recognize the file type or at least have a tool which can unpack and process
the file. In contrast to the more popular .IMG and .ISO disk image files, WIM files are not
supported by Windows built-in ability to mount disk image files. Moreover, the other popular
archive utilities WinRAR and WinZip do not recognize the WIM disk image. WIM files can
be processed with the widely used 7Zip.
In terms of suspiciousness, an inbound email containing a WIM file is not usual and should
raise a few flags. Administrators could look to block these outright. Trustwave MailMarshal
detects these threats bundled inside unusual disk imaging containers using a combination
