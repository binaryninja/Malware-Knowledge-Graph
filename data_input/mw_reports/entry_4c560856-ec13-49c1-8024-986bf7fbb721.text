The new 'Erbium' information-stealing malware is being distributed as fake cracks and
cheats for popular video games to steal victims' credentials and cryptocurrency wallets.
Erbium is a new Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) that provides subscribers with a new
information-stealing malware that is gaining popularity in the cybercrime community thanks
to its extensive functionality, customer support, and competitive pricing.
Researchers at Cluster25's team were the first to report on Erbium earlier this month, but a
new report by Cyfirma shares further information on how the password-stealing trojan is
distributed.

New Malware-as-a-Service operation
Erbium has been promoted on Russian-speaking forums since July 2022, but its actual
deployment in the wild has been uncertain thus far.
Erbium initially cost $9 per week, but since its popularity rose in late August, the price went
up to $100 per month or $1000 for a full-year license.
Compared to the "defacto" choice in the field, RedLine stealer, Erbium's cost is roughly onethird, so it's aiming to disrupt the market for malware commonly used by threat actors.
Like other information-stealing malware, Erbium will steal data stored in web browsers
(Chromium or Gecko-based), such as passwords, cookies, credit cards, and autofill
information.

The malware also attempts to exfiltrate data from a large set of cryptocurrency wallets
installed on web browsers as extensions.

Targeted hot cryptocurrency wallets (Cyfirma)
Cold desktop wallets like Exodus, Atomic, Armory, Bitecoin-Core, Bytecoin, Dash-Core,
Electrum, Electron, Coinomi, Ethereum, Litecoin-Core, Monero-Core, Zcash, and Jaxx are
also stolen.
Erbium also steals two-factor authentication codes from Trezor Password Manager, EOS
Authenticator, Authy 2FA, and Authenticator 2FA.
The malware can grab screenshots from all monitors, snatch Steam and Discord tokens,
steal Telegram auth files, and profile the host based on the OS and hardware.
All data is exfiltrated to the C2 via a built-in API system, while the operators get an overview
of what has been stolen from each infected host on a Erbium dashboard, shown below.

The malware uses three URLs for connecting to the panel, including Discord's Content
Delivery Network (CDN), a platform that malware operators have heavily abused.
While Erbium is still a work in progress, users on hacker forums have praised the author's
efforts and willingness to listen to client requests.
Cluster25 reported signs of Erbium infections worldwide, including in the USA, France,
Colombia, Spain, Italy, India, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

While the first Erbium campaign uses game cracks as lures, the distribution channels could
diversify significantly anytime, as buyers of the malware may choose to push it via different
methods.
To keep the threat out of your system, avoid downloading pirated software, scan all
downloaded files on an AV tool, and keep your software up to date by installing the latest
available security patches.
