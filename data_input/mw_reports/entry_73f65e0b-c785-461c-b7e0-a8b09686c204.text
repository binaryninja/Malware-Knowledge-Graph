– multiple different exploits in each campaign
– often using zero-day (or very fresh) exploits

 stealthy operation and persistence
– reduced risk of detection
– average time of undetected compromise is ~1 year

 well-funded and well-staffed organizations behind
– military or state intelligence organizations
– large companies

Malware
 often used mechansim in targeted attacks
 types
– virus, worm, Trojan, ...

 delivery methods
– attachment of a targeted e-mail
• spear phishing based on social engineering

– redirection to a malicious web page
• drive-by-download

– through a compromised legitimate site
• watering hole attacks

– through an infected USB drive

 infection by exploiting known or publicly unknown vulnerabilities
– bugs in the OS or in applications (e.g., web browser, office suite)
– often allow for executing arbitrary code (e.g., installer of the malware)

Duqu Detector Toolkit
 instead of signature based identification, focus on
behavior based anomaly detection
– e.g., PNF files without corresponding INF files
– detection of encrypted components and registry entries
– false positives are acceptable, given the critical nature of potential
targets

 simple components (tools) provided in C source code
 evaluation results
– detect Duqu and Stuxnet.A
– low number of false positive alarms

 the toolkit has been downloaded from more than 12000
distinct IP addresses distributed over 150 countries

16

How could Duqu have been detected?
 manual inspection of the system status
– multiple running instances of lsass.exe
– suspicious function calls into sortEA74.nls in the stack trace of a
malicious lsass instance (checked with Sysinternal’s Process
Monitor)
– by checking the bootlog, one can figure out that the parent
process of lsass.exe is svchost.exe, whose parent process is
services.exe, which injects code into lsass.exe, alg.exe,
imapi.exe, spoolsv.exe and other svchost.exe instances

 we also tested the hook detection performance of ~40
freely available rootkit detection tools on Duqu infected
computers
– several tools identified anomalies that would be very suspicious
for a knowledgeable system administrator

18

The Duqu experience
 we have never done this sort of work before
– no hands-on experience with state-of-the-art tools (e.g., IDApro)
– didn’t know the information sharing practices in the AV industry
– not sure about our expected role given the supposed creator(s)
and purpose of Duqu

 we worked under extreme time pressure

 “Luck favors the prepared mind” (Pasteur)
 increased visibility
– media coverage
– invitations to various places and visits of different “entities”

Flame (aka sKyWIper) (2012)
 another info-stealer malware
–
–
–
–
–

activates microphones and web cam
logs key strokes
takes screen shots
extracts geolocation data from images
sends and receives commands and data through Bluetooth

 data saved in SQL databases
 data transport via network connections and USB pen drive
 infects computers by masquerading as a proxy for Windows
update
– uses a fake certificate that looks like a valid Microsoft certificate
– needed advanced collision attack on the MD5 hash function

 thousands of victims, mostly in Iran, Israel (Palestine territories), and
Sudan, but also in Hungary!

21

Flame vs. Duqu (Stuxnet)
 Flame is a platform different form Duqu (and Stuxnet)
– larger code size
– use of Lua scripting language
– use of SQLite databases
– larger C&C infrastructure
– C&C servers run different OS (Ubuntu vs. CentOS Linux)

 they may be two implementations for the same requirement
specification developed by two different teams
 the two teams may not be independent
– Kaspersky researchers found chunks of code from a 2009 Stuxnet
variant inside Flame
– CrySyS Lab identified an encryption routine that is the same in
Flame and Stuxnet

Rapid SSL attack in 2008
 collaboration of hackers and
academics led by Alex Sotirov and
Marc Stevens
 demonstrated a practical MD5
collision attack against the
RapidSSL CA
– resulted in a fake SSL certificate
trusted by all browsers

 generating a collision required 2
days on a cluster of 200 PS3s
– equivalent to about $20K
computing capacity on Amazon
EC2

25

Challenges for the attackers
 serial number and validity values are not controlled by the
attacker
– they depend on the issue time of the certificate

 the attackers needed to get the certificate issued at the right
moment (matching the preset serial number and validity)
– they had a 1-millisecond window to submit their query
– probably large number of attempts were required

 questions
– Did the attackers have a fast collision generation algorithm or a large
cluster for computations?
– Were they located close to Microsoft’s certificate server to minimize
packet jitter?

MiniDuke (February 2013)
 targeted multiple government entities and human right
organisations
– governmental victims have been identified in Ukraine, Belgium,
Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Ireland

 uses targeted pdf documents as droppers
– exploits the Acrobat Reader 0-day vulnerability that was published by
FireEye on February 12, 2013

 drops a highly customized backdoor written in assembly
language
– very small in size (only 20kb) and unique for all victims

 this backdoor uses Twitter and Google to locate C&C servers
– The weather is good today. Sunny!
uri!wp07VkkxYt3Mne5uiDkz4Il/Iw48Ge/EWg==

 downloads stage 2 and 3 codes from C&C server disguised as
GIF files

27

Lessons learned
 current practice to defend systems against targeted attacks
have limitations
– Duqu, Flame, and MiniDuke passed signature based virus scanners
– code signing did not help either
• compromised signature key in case of Duqu (and Stuxnet)
• fake certificate for signature verification key in case of Flame

 the attackers are in possession of advanced cryptographic
knowledge
– MD5 collision attack in Flame

 vigilant system administrators could detect advanced attacks
with simple approaches and available tools
– manual inspection of system status, resource usage, and bootlog
– available rootkit detector tools

28

Lessons learned
 mainstream security products are bypassed by attackers
– McAfee, TrendMicro, Sysinternals tools failed to detect Duqu and
Flame
– attackers can fine-tune their code until it pass mainstream
products

 information sharing is crucial for identification of droppers
(and potentially 0-day exploits)
– we played the role of a trusted mediator between Microsoft and
the Duqu victim
– this led to efficient handling of the incident and the discovery of a
0-day Windows kernel exploit
– unlike in our case, security vendors are often unable to obtain
forensics information even when their product detected infection
• droppers of Flame?

Challenge #1: Prevention
 signature based scanning does not work
– assumes that AV company already detected the threat before it affects the
user
– not true for targeted attacks (you may be the first and only victim)
– polymorphism allows for individualized malware samples
– attacker can test AV products available on the market

 on-the-fly dynamic analysis of behavior?
– open document / download web page in closely monitored virtual machine
– examples: FireEye, LastLine
– problems:
• malware can detect the virtualized environment
• ensuring transparency is very difficult

 sandboxing and virtualization?
– create isolated execution environments and monitor accesses through their
boundary to system resources
– examples: Java VM, VMware, VirtualBox, Bromium vSentry, Qubes OS
– problems:
• usability, convenience, and performance issues

30

Challenge #2: Fast detection
 determined and resourceful attackers will eventually succeed in
compromising any system
 detection of being compromised can focus on lateral movement, C&C
communications, and data exfiltration

 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems?
– collect and correlate event logs
– raise alarms
– problems:
• false positives
• need expert knowledge to configure properly

 defender can also take advantage of the home ground
–
–
–
–

can use traps and baits to mislead the attacker
examples: honeypots and honeytokens
also allow for observation of attacker activities, tools, and tactics
problems:
• management of honeypots and honeytokens can be cumbersome
• is this only a question of lacking good management tools?

31

Challenge #3: Information asymmetry
attackers have knowledge on available security tools, and
they may also know the security posture of the defender
defenders know very little about the attacker
 how can we decrease this asymmetry?
 hide some part of the security posture
– custom security tools and configurations
– honeypots and honeytokens could also be used here

 try to obtain more information about the attacker
– threat intelligence gathering from different sources
– client honeypots

www.crysys.hu

32

Challenge #4: Information sharing
 victims of attacks are reluctant to share incident information
and forensics material
– privacy issues, sensitive company related information

 security vendors could collect lot of information on potential
new threats
– e.g., silent detection by AV vendors, Cisco SenderBase, cloud based
protection by SIEM vendors, ...

 but security vendors may not want to share their collected
intelligence to preserve market advantage

 standards for exchange of incident data are emerging
– STIX - Structured Threat Information Expression
– TAXII - Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information

 legal issues may impede data sharing
– incident reports, traffic logs, DNS data include personally identifiable
information

CrySyS Adat- és Rendszerbiztonság Laboratórium
www.crysys.hu

33

Challenge #5: Lack of good experts
 a good expert
– knows about old tricks and new trends in cyber attacks
– knows the systems and networks he is responsible for
– can use and configure available security tools
– can select new security tools to buy
– has time to look into the tools’ output

 better education, training, simulation exercises are
needed
