LockPOS is a point-of-sale malware discovered in 2017 that is used to exfiltrate payment
card data from targeted point-of-sale systems’ memory. The most recent version of
LockPOS examined here changed its injection technique to drop the malware directly to the
kernel to evade detection and bypass traditional antivirus (AV) hooks.
This evasion technique has been seen before being employed by a similar malware
(Flokibot POS Malware). In addition to the injection technique, this new malware variant is
also communicating with a new command-and-control (C2) server that hasn’t been seen
before.
The following a technical overview of this new technique used by LockPOS:

Technical Analysis

1/17

The malware has a core resource section that is encrypted:

Figure 1
When it runs, it begins making API calls that are used to decrypt itself, and the APIs are
obfuscated using API hashing:

The decrypted executable with a debugging string shown below is then loaded to memory
for execution:

7/17

Figure 3
When executed, the malware uses API calls from ntdll.dll to inject itself into explorer.exe as
a persistence mechanism. The API calls are still made using the API hashing, a method
that is new for LockPOS which allows the malware to avoid traditional AV detection by
injecting the code on-the-fly within memory:

Figure 4
The injected code will then try to connect to the C2 server at the following address:
bbbclearner[dot]at/_x/update[dot]php
This is a new C2 server that has never been seen in malware campaigns prior. The C2
server also has what seems to be a back-end panel that is similar to the one seen before
with the treasurehunter[dot]at C2 server.

Figure 5
In addition to the abovementioned C2 server, the malware also reaches out to multiple,
unregistered domains, most likely as a method used to disrupt any analysis of the file and to
hide the real C2 server domain (a full list of the domains can be found in IOCs section
below).
