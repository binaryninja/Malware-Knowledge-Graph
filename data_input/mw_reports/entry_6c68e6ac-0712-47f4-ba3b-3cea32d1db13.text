Threat Attribution Research Comparison
On 12 January 2021, Fox-IT & NCC Group published their detailed report, “Abusing Cloud
Services to Fly Under the Radar”. The threat actor tracked in their report shared many
similarities to the China-linked threat actor Chimera, whom CyCraft attributed to a year-long
cyberattack targeting the Taiwan semiconductor industry just last year.
Much like Chimera, the threat actor mentioned in the Fox-IT & NCC Group report (referred to
in this article as CUTR, Chimera Under the Radar) targeted intellectual property (IP) from the
semiconductor industry; however, the report goes into further detail explaining how their

threat actor’s targets were more diverse, including targeting sensitive data from the EU
aviation industry.
In this article, we analyze and compare their research to ours.

Conclusions
1. There is a strong probability the threat actor, CUTR, is Chimera as their IoCs,
commonly used infra, tools, techniques, and behaviors are all very similar to Chimera;
42 of the 67 adversarial techniques used in both campaigns were identical.
2. China-linked threat actors (e.g., Chimera, BlackTech, APT30) are known to share tools
and attack methods with each other, making attribution challenging.
3. Some differences in attack behavior may be due to differences in the victims’
architecture, security maturity, or geographic location (EU, not Taiwan). Different
environments may require different TTP. TTP designed for infiltrating Taiwan’s
semiconductor industry may require adjustment for the EU aviation industry and vice
versa.
4. Chimera was focused solely on the Taiwan semiconductor industry. CUTR showed “a
wide set of interests,” including the EU semiconductor industry as well as aviation.
While some China-linked threat actors have demonstrated an ability to adapt
techniques, tools, and targets, sudden changes in attack behavior are not common —
keeping true to the ideas behind Bianco’s Pyramid of Pain, as mentioned in the Fox-IT
& NCC Group report. As TTPs are the hardest to change and tend to stay inflexible for
longer periods of time, similar TTP usage between different attack
campaigns/operations is a strong indicator of attribution.

2/8

As mentioned in the FOX-IT & NCC Group report, Bianco’s Pyramid of Pain illustrates how
difficult it is for an attacker to circumvent a particular attack method that has been stripped
away from them. For example, while blocking a file or IP address is rather trivial for an
attacker to get around, taking away an attacker’s tool is challenging; they will have to devise
a new way of carrying out their objectives.
According to the Fox-IT & NCC Group report, “the largest overlap [between Chimera and
their threat actor] is in the top half of the Pyramid of Pain: domain names, host artifacts,
tools, and TTPs.”
We will compare Chimera with CUTR using the Pyramid of Pain model from the ground up.

Hash Values
The following table shows the hash of these IoCs. As depicted in the table, 3 of the hashes
are identical to our research. Even though the identical WinRAR and get.exe can be easily
used by other threat actors, the added inclusion of the Cloud exfil tool increases the
probability of Chimera attribution.
Chimera primarily used both the Cobalt Strike Beacon and the Winnti backdoors during their
operation against Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. CUTR was not observed using the Winnti
backdoor but was observed using Cobalt Strike Beacon’s remote access functionality;
however, we cannot confirm if it is the exact same Cobalt Strike Beacon as Fox-IT & NCC
Group did not release the hash in their report.

IP address & Domain Name
None of the domain names are identical, but the behavior of abusing the cloud platforms
such as Appspot or Azure Edge is aligned with our findings. This increases the probability of
Chimera attribution.

Network & Host Artifacts
Some file names used are similar to our research. Here we list some similar naming
schemes.

TTP
According to the Pyramid of Pain model, TTP are the most difficult and less frequently
changed methods of an attacker, suggesting that campaigns/operations with multiple
similarities in TTP are most likely performed by the same threat actor.
Comparing the adversarial techniques used by Chimera and CUTR, 42 of the 67 adversarial
techniques used in both campaigns were identical. Below are a few notable similarities and
differences.

Techniques critical to both Chimera & CUTR’s attack behavior:
T1003.003 OS Credential Dumping: NTDS
T1003.001 OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory
T1053.005 Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task
T1078 Valid Accounts

Observed only in CUTR:
T1574.002 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading
T1111 Two-Factor Authentication Interception
T1550.002 Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash

Observed only in Chimera:
T1055.001 Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection
T1556.001 Modify Authentication Process: Domain Controller Authentication
Differences in attack behavior may be due to differences in the victims’ architecture, security
maturity, geographic location (EU, not Taiwan), or differences in visibility.
Both threat actors are China-based and located in the UTC +8 timezone.

Summary
Threat attribution is difficult.
China-linked threat actors are known to share tools and attack methods (and possibly even
personnel) with each other. Differences in victim security operational culture, geographic
location, system architecture, security maturity, industry, and defense technology can all lead
to minor and major differences in attack behavior. There are always numerous factors to
consider and weigh, making perfect attribution difficult.

6/8

However, the evidence presented after comparing research from both CyCraft and Fox-IT &
NCC Group illustrates a strong likelihood that CUTR is Chimera.
Chimera and CUTR are both located in the UTC +8 timezone, are China-based, and have a
strong overlap in IoCs, commonly used infra, tools, techniques, and behavior. 42 of the 67
adversarial techniques used in both Chimera and CUTR campaigns were identical.
CyCraft confirms with high confidence that CUTR is Chimera.
We would like to thank Fox-IT & NCC Group for their detailed report, added visibility into the
Chimera threat, and added threat intelligence against this China-based threat actor so that
SOCs can better defend their organizations and keep their data secure.
