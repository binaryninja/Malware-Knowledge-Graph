Nefilim Ransomware Attack Uses “Ghost” Credentials

Keeping close tabs on the account credentials in your organization should always be a top
priority, as a Sophos Rapid Response customer recently learned. Sophos Rapid Response is
a 24/7 service that helps organizations to quickly identify and neutralize active threats.
The company reached out to Rapid Response to get help with a Nefilim (also known as
Nemty) ransomware attack in which more than 100 systems were impacted. Sophos’
Intercept X endpoint protection has no problem detecting and stopping Nefilim.
Unfortunately, the customer did not have this protection in place. Nefilim ransomware, like
virtually all major ransomware, replaces the original files with encrypted versions, making
recovery impossible without either the decryption key or a recent backup.
The Rapid Response team sprang into action as soon as they were contracted by the
customer, loading Sophos security onto all the systems it could access, ensuring all
necessary protections were turned on for systems that already had Sophos installed, and
digging for clues as to how and when the intrusion began and what might have been stolen.
By the time of Sophos’ standard “kick-off” call to describe the process of the Rapid Response
team and gather context around the evidence uncovered so far, the team had already
singled out user accounts that had been taken over and compiled a general timeline of the
attack.

The team determined the attacker had compromised an admin account with high level
access about one month before
launching Nefilim ransomware.
Or more accurately, the attacker
gained access to that admin
account, then spent one month
quietly moving around to steal
credentials for a domain admin
account, finding the trove of data
they wanted, exfiltrating hundreds
of GB of data, and then finally
announcing their presence with
the ransomware attack.
“Ransomware is the final payload in a longer attack. It is the attacker telling you they already
have control of your network and have finished the bulk of the attack. It is the attacker
declaring victory,” Peter Mackenzie, manager for Rapid Response, said. “Identifying you are
under a ransomware attack is easy, identifying the attacker was on your network a week
earlier is what counts.”
Based on Sophos intelligence, the Rapid Response team knew the threat actors behind
Nefilim ransomware commonly gain initial access either by exploiting vulnerable versions of
Citrix or Remote Desktop Protocol. In this case, the adversary exploited vulnerable Citrix
software, gained access to the admin account, then stole the credentials for a domain admin
account using Mimikatz.
During Sophos’ initial kick-off call, the Rapid Response team relayed which admin account
had been compromised in the initial intrusion, and asked the customer: Whose account was
it? The answer: the account belonged to an individual who had sadly passed away around
three months before the attacker’s first move.
Apparently, the account was kept active because there were services that it was used for,
meaning the Rapid Response team had to discern which activities from that account were
legitimate and which were malicious.
“The malicious activities were often in the middle of the night for the customer’s local time,”
Mackenzie said. “We were able to work out some of the movements in the account based on
when they occurred and when the commands were being performed.”
If an organization really needs an account after someone has left the company, they should
implement a service account and deny interactive logins to prevent any unwanted activity.
Or, if they don’t need the account for anything else, disable it and carry out regular audits of
Active Directory. Active Directory Audit Policies can be set to monitor for admin account
activity or if an account is added to the domain admin group.

Mackenzie noted far fewer
accounts need to be a domain
admin than most people think.
“People assume because a
person is an executive or is in
charge of the network that they
need to be using a domain admin
account. This isn’t true and it’s
dangerous,” Mackenzie said. “No
account with privileges should be
used by default for work that
doesn’t require that level of
access. Users should elevate to
using the required accounts when
needed and only for that task.”
Mackenzie added that alerts
should be set so that if the
domain admin account is used or
if a new admin account is
created, someone knows. A
previous case that Rapid
Response was called in on
proved this point.
In this particular case, an attacker
gained access to an
organization’s network, created a
new user, and added that
account to the domain admin
group in Active Directory. No
alerts were set off, so that new
domain admin account went on to
delete about 150 virtual servers
and used Microsoft BitLocker to
encrypt the server backups.
Mackenzie told the customer they
were lucky the attack was so
visibly destructive and easily
noticed.

“If they hadn’t done that, how
long would they have had domain
admin access to the network
without the customer knowing?”

Detection and IoCs
Nefilim ransomware is detected in Sophos Endpoint Protection under the definition
Troj/Ransom-GDN.
Additional indicators of compromise have been published to the SophosLabs Github.

Nefilim group Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
The common Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of the group(s) that operate
Nefilim ransomware have often utilized Citrix vulnerabilities or Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) to gain initial entry into victim environments by exploiting public facing applications
MITRE ATT&CK T1190.
In this case, the Rapid Response team discovered vulnerable versions of Citrix software on
customer systems. Although it is unclear what vulnerability was exploited, the installed Citrix
Storefront 7.15 CU3 was vulnerable at time of incident to 1 Critical (CVE-2019-11634) and 4
High rated CVE vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-13608, CVE-2020-8269, CVE-2020-8270, CVE2020-8283) which may have been exploited in order to gain initial access to the target
network.
Once in, the threat actor also used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logins to maintain
access to the initial admin account used in the attack. On the network, the threat actor used
Mimikatz, which allows the threat actors to reveal the credentials stored on the system, to
compromise a domain admin account.

4/5

The Rapid Response investigation uncovered PowerShell commands as well as the use of
RDP and Cobalt Strike to move laterally to multiple hosts, conduct reconnaissance, and
enumerate the network.
The threat actor installed the file transfer and synchronization application MEGA in order to
exfiltrate data.
The Nefilim ransomware binaries were deployed using Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) via the compromised domain admin account.

Checklist for secure account access management
Only grant the access permissions needed for a specific task or role
Disable accounts no longer needed
If you need to keep an account active after the original owner has left the organization,
implement a service account and deny interactive logins
Carry out regular audits of Active Directory: Active Directory Audit Policies can be set
to monitor for admin account activity or if an unexpected account is added to the
domain admin group
Have a robust security solution in place, ideally with anti-ransomware technologies
such as that featured in Intercept X
