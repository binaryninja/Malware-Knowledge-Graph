Exploring CVE-2015-2545 and its users

06 May 2016
By Pierre Montagnier and Tom Lancaster
Executive Summary
This report, available at TLP:GREEN to researchers and network defenders, gives an overview of
different attacks using CVE-2015-2545. Speciﬁcally we look at the different ways attackers are triggering
the vulnerability, and the possibility that the exploit is shared amongst various groups. Based on overlaps
in the samples analysed, our ﬁndings show that there are several clusters of documents, with the majority
of the document-based builders sharing similar constructs in terms of how the ﬁnal payload is discovered
and executed. We also found that more recently some attackers are triggering the vulnerability through
the use of MHTML ﬁles with .doc extensions.
Background
Back in November 2015, FireEye published a report titled 'Two For One'[1] detailing two new zero days,
one affecting Microsoft (MS) Word and the other affecting the Windows operating system. Our report
focuses on the former, CVE 2015-2545.
The vulnerability stems from a ﬂaw in the processing of Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) ﬁles and allows
an attacker to execute arbitrary code. We have been tracking samples exploiting this vulnerability as well
as tracking the associated malware, much of which has been already discussed in public reporting.

The report summarises our ﬁndings based on samples collected in 2016, and explores similarities and
differences in the shellcode between different documents exploiting this vulnerability.
