Description

This Windows program from the Kupay Service site is a Windows MSI Installer with the file name Kupay[GUID].msi. The installer was hosted at
hxxps[:]kupaywallet.com/product/[GUID]. The [GUID] is a unique file that is crated for a specific victim and is being withheld to preserve the identit
recipient.
The installer looks legitimate and will install the "Kupay.exe" (1b60a6d35c872102f535ae6a3d7669fb7d55c43dc7e73354423fdcca01a955d6) file in
(x86)\Kupay” folder. It also installs "KupayUpgrade.exe" (fc1aafd2ed190fa523e60c3d22b6f7ca049d97fc41c9a2fe987576d6b5e81d6d) in the “C:\U
<username>\AppData\Roaming\KupaySupport” folder. Immediately after installation, the installer launches the "KupayUpgrade.exe" binary.

Description

In March 2020, a download link for the OSX version of Kupay Wallet was found to be hosted at hxxps[:]//kupaywallet.com/[GUID]. The OSX progr
download link is an Apple DMG installer. The [GUID] is a unique file that is crafted for a specific victim and is being withheld to preserve the identi
recipient. The OSX program uses a DMG installer with the file name Kupay[GUID].dmg.
The OSX program does not have digital signature, and will warn of that before installation. Just as JMTTrader, CelasTradePro, and UnionCrypto,
appears to be legitimate, and installs both “Kupay” in the “/Applications/Kupay.app/Contents/MacOS/” folder and a program named kupay_upgrad
“/Applications/Kupay.app/Contents/MacOS/” folder. The installer contains a postinstall script (Figure 8).
The postinstall script is identical in functionality to the postinstall scripts from previous AppleJeus variants, though accomplishes the same function
previously done. The postinstall script creates a “KupayDaemon” folder in the OSX “/Library/Application Support” folder, and moves kupay_upgrad
Support” folder contains both system and third-party support files which are necessary for program operation. Typically, the subfolders have name
actual applications. At installation, Kupay placed the plist file (com.kupay.pkg.wallet.plist) in “/Library/LaunchDaemons/”.
While previous versions of AppleJeus simply moved the plist file to the LaunchDaemons folder and waited for a restart for it to be loaded, the Kup
command “launchctl load” to load the plist without a restart. The postinstall then launches the kupay_upgrade program in the background.

Description

This OSX sample was contained within Apple DMG "Kupay.dmg." When executed, "kupay_upgrade" immediately sleeps for five seconds and the
coded value stored in “isReady” is a 0 or a 1. If it is a 0, the program sleeps again, and if it is a 1, the function “CheckUpdate” is called. This functi
logic functionality of the malware. "CheckUpdate" sends a POST to the C2 hxxps[:]//kupaywallet.com/kupay_update.php with a connection named
(Check Update Osx)."
Just as the Windows malware, the timestamp is placed into a format string “ver=%d&timestamp=%ld” where ver is set as the 90001, possibly refe
version 4 Kupay Wallet (Figure 11).
If the C2 server returns a file, it is decoded and written to “/private/tmp/kupay_update”, with permissions by the command chmod 700 (only the us
execute). The stage2 (/private/tmp/kupay_update) is then launched, and the malware kupay_upgrade returns to sleeping and checking in with the

Description

This file is the stage 2 payload for the OSX KupayWallet. The stage 2 payload for the OSX KupayWallet was decoded and analyzed, and file prop
decoded file. The stage 2 kupay_update has a variety of functionalities. Most importantly, kupay_update checks in with the C2 levelframeblog.com
connecting to the C2, kupay_update can send or receive a payload, read and write files, execute commands via the terminal, etc.
If a payload is received or is going to be sent, kupay_update will base64 encode/decode and XOR encode/decode the data before sending or afte
which base64 encode and decode are named b64_encode and b64_decode.
The functions which XOR encodes and decodes is XEncoding, and it uses a 32-byte XOR key which is hardcoded into kupay_update. The key is
“wLqfM]%wTx`~tUTbw>R^0x18#yG5R(30x7FC:;” where all values are in ASCII except for 0x18 and 0x7F as those are non-readable characters in
used in the DecryptPayload and CryptPayload functions. These two functions implement the XOR encode or decode without calling XEncoding, a
b64_decode and b64_encode functions.
Kupay_update checks in with the C2 frequently, in order to execute or preform whatever commands and requests the server sends. There are mu
throughout the function to dictate when the contact with the C2 is made.
