Italian authorities have launched an inquiry into a spyware vendor that made malicious apps
for the Google Play Store and infected almost 1,000 people with them.
Friday, Motherboard revealed that an Italian company called eSurv had uploaded 25
malicious apps on Android’s official app store over the span of two years. The company has
a contract for the development of a “passive and active interception system” for the Italian
State Police, but it’s unclear if the apps were used by law enforcement authorities.
Now, newspapers in Italy have revealed that prosecutors in Naples opened an inquiry into
eSurv and its activities well before last week’s report. Two sources close to the company
confirmed the investigation to Motherboard.

Three weeks ago, one of the sources said, police raided eSurv’s office and seized all
computers on suspicion of illegal wiretapping.

On Monday, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that prosecutors are specifically
looking into four people. Among them are Giuseppe Fasano, the head of eSurv, and
Salvatore Ansani, another member of the company’s management.
A spokesperson for eSurv did not respond to a request for comment.
The Naples prosecutor's office said in a press release Monday that it is investigating both
eSurv and STM, another company that worked with the surveillance company. As part of the
investigation, the press release read, the prosecutors shut down eSurv’s infrastructure, which
was used to operate the spyware, code-named Exodus.
