Impact of Alleged Russian Cyber Attacks
By William C. Ashmore *
During a two week period in April and May of 2007 Estonia was the
victim of a sustained massive cyber attack on its information infrastructure.
While the cyber attack was not the first nor was it the largest, it was the
first cyber attack that was directed at the national security of a country.
(Davis, 2009)
The significance of a cyber attack on a small country can be difficult to
measure for a casual observer. Estonia is a small country that can be seen
as a model for the future. Estonians have developed and used internet
technology for voting, education, security and banking (ninety-five percent
of banking operations are done electronically) (Collier, 2007). It is not
uncommon to see a sign for free Wi-Fi internet access at a pub, restaurant
or on public transportation. 1
Imagine going to an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), while on a
business trip, to get money for meals and lodging and the system is down.
Restaurants and hotels are unable to process your credit card. You try to
send a message to your bank, your work, and your family but the computer
servers are all down. The government is unable to communicate with the
public and its different departments. News agencies are having difficulties
publishing information. The aftermath of a cyber attack can impact anyone
that uses the internet, whether it is an individual, business, or government
that has been affected. By investigating the attack, how it happened, and
Estonia’s reaction, states can decide whether their internet defences and
strategies are adequate. 2
The cyber attacks on Estonia have implications for both its allies and
adversaries. This article is not meant to establish a complete strategy for
cyber defence but to create a better understanding of how a cyber attack
can have far reaching consequences beyond the immediate aftermath of a
targeted infrastructure. What are the implications for Estonia? Is the
framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
appropriate for cyber defence? Is an attack against one really an attack

against all? Does the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE) have the ability to react to cyber attacks? Lastly, does the
Russian Federation have a coherent cyber strategy that it is willing to use
and what have been the consequences for Russia?
Any country that uses the internet as part of its infrastructure needs to be
aware of the vulnerabilities and consequences of a cyber attack on their
system. A coherent strategy must include internet defences that are set-up
in conjunction with technical defences. Currently, legal definitions for
cyber crimes do not exist in all countries. The international community
must examine treaties and update them to better define assistance and
common defence in the event of a cyber attack. Russians have shown the
ability and the desire to use cyber warfare. Cyber strategy by, in defence of,
or against Russia affects more than computer networks. Although, attacks
that originate in China, Japan or the United States may have similar
implications they are outside of the scope of this article.
Internet attacks occur on a daily basis throughout the world. How nations
prepare themselves for an internet attack will determine the impact of a
cyber attack on their infrastructure. The aim of this article is to achieve a
greater understanding of the possible Russian cyber strategy and to
understand the counter measures that can be used to prevent or mitigate
cyber attacks. This awareness could possibly prevent a tactical defeat
during conflict when a cyber attack targeting command and control and
communications infrastructure is blocked.
1. The media accounts
Internet trade magazines and mass media reports were used to gather
evidence on the events surrounding the cyber attack on Estonia. Internet
sources were a major source of information on the subject of cyber
security because of the amount of information that is new and has not yet
been published in books. Several Estonian government officials have
spoken on the issue of cyber attacks at great lengths. Estonian government
documents were also used to analyze the Estonian response to the cyber
attack. Media accounts along with documents from the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were used to analyze the aftermath of the
Estonian cyber attack on organizations and other states. Analysis of
Russian involvement was conducted using western documents.

In order to understand the reasons behind the Estonian cyber attack this
article will explore the social tensions and the cyber attack itself. The
impact that the attack had on the different actors will also be noted. The
reality of the attacks indicates some important implications for Estonia and
other former Soviet satellites to work with NATO to develop a coherent
cyber strategy. Russia’s cyber strategy also has considerable significance for
the United States. This article will conclude with a summary of possible
countermeasures to a cyber attack.
2. Cyber attack on Estonia
The social tensions between Estonians and Estonia’s Russian minority are
key to understanding why there was a cyber attack. Estonia is made up of
1.3 million people where 25.6 percent of the population is Russian (Central
Intelligence Agency, 2008). In 1918, the Estonians gained their
independence from Russia, and in 1940 they were forced into the Soviet
Union. From 1940 until they regained their independence in 1991 Estonia
viewed Russia’s presence as an illegal occupation. Mass deportations were
made, people were summarily executed, and the population was resettled
by ethnic Russians. Russians on the other hand view the Estonians as
ungrateful because they were saved by Russians from the Nazi German
fascists. Today there exists significant animosity between the Russians and
the Estonians that permeate personal relationships and political
interactions within the country and between the two nations. (Vesilind,
2008) 3
The actual events that occurred in Estonia centred on the Soviet Bronze
Soldier monument. The Bronze Soldier monument is a World War II
Soviet War memorial which memorialized the graves of Soviet Soldiers
who died during World War II. However, over time ethnic Russians had
used the memorial as a rallying site for demonstrations and other forms of
protest against the Estonian government. This led to a decision by the
Estonian government to move the monument to an area that was less
public. (Davis, 2009)
The decision to move the statue led to actual riots in the capital city of
Tallinn on April 27th, 2007. The demonstrations degraded into criminal
activities involving looting and the destruction of private and public
property. Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested, most of whom were

6

Volume 11, 2009

ethnic Russians. The civil unrest was contained, order was restored to the
streets by the Estonian government, and most of the physical damage was
repaired by the next morning. (Davis, 2009)
During this period of civil unrest computers in the Estonian government
and the Estonian national media were hacked into with significant affect.
Some of the attacks on the system were vandalism of sites and some were
distributed denial of service attacks (a cyber attack that disrupts internet
service so that a user cannot access a given computer service). The attacks
started small with a major attack culminating on the Estonian internet
system on May 9th, 2007. This date coincidentally corresponded to the day
the Russians celebrate their victory over the Germans in World War II.
During this time a Russian youth-group conducted protests against the
Estonian ambassador to Russia and against the Estonian Embassy in
Moscow. The protests against the ambassador and the embassy did not
end until the ambassador left the country as part of a deal that was
negotiated by Germany. The Russian government even suspended
passenger rail services between Tallinn and St. Petersburg. The riots, the
protests, the stopping of rail service, and the cyber attacks led to an
increasingly tense relationship between Estonia and Russia. (Davis, 2009;
Kampmark, 2003: 288-293)
The Estonians were able to respond to the cyber attacks in a very
proficient manner, as they were able to coordinate responses that only
caused relatively short term outages instead of any permanent damage to
their IT infrastructure. The Estonian government was able to employ its
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) which coordinated IT
responses among government and civilian specialists. However, due to the
ambiguous nature of the internet and the use of fake internet protocol (IP)
addresses the Estonian’s were unable to conclusively prove who initiated
the cyber attacks. (Collier, 2007)
The cyber attacks themselves were not very sophisticated as the attackers
used techniques that had been in existence for several years. The focus of
the cyber attack was to completely shut down the IT structure of Estonia.
The cyber attackers used botnet attacks to perform a distributed denial of
service rendering systems that use the internet useless. Botnets are hijacked
computers that send out mass amounts of information which overwhelm
an internet server. The increase in internet traffic will cause a server to
exceed its bandwidth capabilities and cause it to shut down. The botnets

7

can be installed well in advance of a planned cyber attack, and they can be
placed in any computer anywhere in the world. If the computer user has
not installed appropriate protective software on their computer they will
not even know that they have been hijacked and that they are participating
in a cyber attack. The botnet attacks on the Estonian IT structure ended as
abruptly as they began leading Estonian officials to conclude that the
attack was a planned and coordinated. (Davis, 2009)
The cyber attacks on Estonia illustrates the vulnerability of IT structures
that rely on the internet. The use of technology can improve personal,
business, and government interactions but it is still vulnerable to attacks
and interruptions. The next section of this article will concentrate on the
implications for Estonia in the aftermath of the cyber attacks.
3. Implications for Estonia
After the cyber attacks in 2007, there were several implications for Estonia
as the country recovered from the cyber wake-up call. Some implications
had an immediate impact on the people and the government of Estonia,
while others were more long term and required a deliberate strategy. The
immediate implication for Estonia was the loss of services for government,
communication, and banking. What emerged from the attack was Estonia’s
ability to counter and minimize the effects of the attack. There was no
permanent damage to the information technology (IT) structure and
financial losses were minimal, but the significance was frightening. (Collier,
2007)
One of the long term implications is the continued strain on Estonia’s
relationship with Russia. Members of the Estonian government and
outside observers believe that the attacks originated in Russia, but that fact
remains unproven. The finger pointing between Estonia and Russia began
immediately after the attacks and continues today. Dmitry Peskov, Deputy
Press Secretary for the Russian President said, “Russia can no way be
involved in cyber terrorism and all claims to the contrary are an absolute
lie” (The Baltic Times, 2007a). Andrus Ansip, the Estonian Prime Minister,
and others have accused the Russian government because of the
identification of Russian internet protocol (IP) addresses used in the attack.
To date, Russian involvement has never been proven, but the implications
and belief that they were involved continues to influence and affect the
relationship between Russia and Estonia. (The Baltic Times, 2007b)

After the attacks and recovery, Estonia has been heralded as a leader in
technological security. According to Alexander Ntok, head of Corporate
Strategy at the International Telecommunication Union, “it was
imaginative responses that allowed Estonia to emerge from the spring
cyber attack relatively unscathed” (Collier, 2007). As a result Estonia has
capitalized on the internet security market. They are called upon to assist
during attacks and to speak to different business and IT groups on internet
security issues. Estonian government leaders have spoken to allies, regional
organizations and international organizations to improve IT security and
cooperation. (Ibid.)
When Georgia’s IT infrastructure was attacked in August 2008 specialists
from Estonia’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) travelled to
Georgia and assisted response efforts to counter the attacks (DPA, 2008).
This example demonstrates how Estonia has established itself as a major
player in an emerging field, as they are too small to make a large impact on
the international scene through the use of economic or military power.
Estonia has been able to establish itself as a major player in Europe and
among NATO members as an expert in cyber security and cyber war.
Their expertise has allowed them to lobby for increased IT awareness and
for increased cooperation to defeat or deter future cyber attacks.
(Nikiforov, 2008)
In 2003 Estonia proposed a cyber excellence centre in Tallinn even before
it became a member of NATO. In light of Estonia’s expertise in IT the
NATO Cyber Defence Centre was approved. In May 2008 the centre
opened in Tallinn with Estonia providing the leadership and personnel to
man the centre. Estonia emerged as a leader within NATO and leads the
effort to protect the IT structure of NATO. (Socor, 2008)
The continuous threat of cyber attacks against its IT structure, and the
dedication of public officials to improve IT security resulted in a
comprehensive national cyber security strategy. This strategy, developed by
the Ministry of Defence, was adopted by the Estonian government in May
of 2008, just over a year after the attack on its IT systems. The main
measures of its strategy included IT security measures that strengthened
their defensive posture, as well as developed their expertise and awareness
in the IT field. Estonia now looks to strengthen the international legal
framework to ensure that the IT system is protected by laws, and that

9

violators of the law will be prosecuted. Estonia has also taken the charge
of increasing international co-operation not just to protect their systems
but to protect the global cyber system. (Estonian Ministry of Defence,
2008)
4. Cyber concerns for former Soviet satellites
What do the countries of Estonia, Georgia, Lithuania and Kyrgyzstan have
in common? They are all former Soviet satellites and have all been allegedly
cyber attacked by Russia.
4.1. Georgian cyber attack
On July 20th, 2008 the website of the Georgian president came under a
denial of service cyber attack. The attack shut the website down for 24
hours and was a precursor to a larger cyber attack that would come less
than a month later (Melikishvili, 2008/2009). On August 8th, 2008 a
coordinated distributed denial of service attack was made against the
Georgian government websites at the same time that Russian forces were
engaged in combat with Georgian forces. As the ground attacks increased
so did the cyber attacks. This was the first time that a cyber attack was
done in conjunction with armed conflict. (Ibid)
The cyber war between Georgia and Russia focused on shaping public
opinion on the internet. Georgian and Russian supporters used a variety of
cyber techniques including distributed denial of service attacks and the
creation of fake web sites to control how their version of the “truth” was
delivered to the public. (Thomas, 2009:55-59)
Georgia’s IT infrastructure was not very advanced so the disruption of
service was not as complicated as it was in Estonia. Banking, media and
government websites were blocked disrupting the flow of information
throughout Georgia and to the outside world. The websites of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and the National Bank were vandalized by adding
pictures of the Georgian President and Adolf Hitler (Melikishvili,
2008/2009). The cyber attacks against Georgia were different from the
cyber attacks on Estonia, as these attacks included distributed denial of
services using botnets, but they also included SQL injection attacks that are
harder to identify than a botnet attack because they require less computers
than a botnet attack. The SQL injection attack shows a greater expertise in

10

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

the ability to conduct a cyber attack than the cyber attacks on Estonia’s IT
infrastructure. (Secure Works Press Release, 2008)
Georgia received considerable assistance in countering the cyber attacks
and in communicating internally and internationally. Google provided
domain space to protect the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and Civil.ge, a Georgian Daily online news service. A private American
internet service provider (the head of the company is an ethnic Georgian)
assisted the Georgian government by hosting the Georgian President’s
website. The President of Poland also assisted the Georgian government
by placing official press releases on his website. Estonia even sent two
information security specialists from its Computer Emergency Response
Team to assist Georgia in countering the cyber attacks. According to
outside investigators there is no direct proof of any Russian government
involvement in the cyber attacks. But what is undeniable is that even
without proven Russian government involvement it remains clear that the
Russian government benefited from the cyber attacks. (Melikishvili,
2008/2009)
4.2. Lithuanian cyber attack
Lithuania faced its own attacks in June 2008 three days after it passed a law
outlawing the use of Soviet and communist symbols; over 300 websites
were attacked. Some were denial of service attacks while other sites were
vandalized with the Soviet hammer and sickle. Prior to the attacks and the
passage of the law, Russian and Lithuanian ties had deteriorated because of
Russia’s refusal to compensate Lithuanian victims of Soviet labour camps,
and Russia’s leveraging of energy resources for political gain. Lithuania also
blocked talks on an EU-Russia partnership. The animosities between the
two countries have provided observers with a clear motive that the attacks
were by the Russians. The reason for the cyber attacks against Lithuania
was similar to the cyber attacks against Estonia, both attacks were in
response to a government action that was unpopular to the Russian
people. (McLaughlin, 2008)
4.3. Kyrgyzstan cyber attack
The latest country that has come under a cyber attack from computers in
Russia is Kyrgyzstan. On January 18th, 2009 Kyrgyzstan’s two main
internet servers came under a denial of service attacks shutting down

11

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

websites and email within the country. The originators of the attacks were
traced back to Russia (Rhoads, 2009). The attacks occurred on the same
day that the Russian government was pressuring Kyrgyzstan to stop U.S.
access to the airbase at Bishkek at Manas. The airbase is a key logistics
centre that supports the U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan. According to Don
Jackson, a senior security researcher at SecureWorks 4, the distributed denial
of service attacks are believed to be directed towards any opposition that is
not in favour of the closure of the airbase. While it is unproven whether
the government was behind the attacks the implication is that cyber attacks
will be used against any opposition to the Russian government (Bradbury,
2009).
The cyber attacks on Georgia, Lithuania and Kyrgyzstan have two
characteristics in common. The first characteristic is that the cyber attacks
were initiated because of opposition to the Russian government and
secondly that there is no proof that the Russian government was involved
in the cyber attacks. Regardless of who is initiating the attack it is clear that
opposition to the Russian government could result in a cyber attack which
could disrupt critical government infrastructure.
5. Compelling realities for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
Cyber defence is a critical issue for NATO. U.S. General James Mattis,
NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation, articulates the
importance of cyber defence for NATO by stating, “We cannot say that
we are not going to defend the Web that everybody needs” (Tanner &
Peach, 2008). Nations that are party to the North Atlantic Treaty agree on
Article 5 “that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or
North America shall be considered an attack against them all…” (The
North Atlantic Treaty, 1949). Does a cyber attack fit the requirement of an
armed attack? A senior NATO official asked, “If a member state’s
communications centre is attacked with a missile, you call it an act of war.
So what do you call it if the same installation is disabled with a cyberattack?” (The Economist, 2007). However, the current political reality is
that they are not the same. Prior to the cyber attacks on Estonia, NATO’s
cyber strategy was focused on NATO’s ability to protect its own IT
infrastructure. Now, the current reality is, is that the NATO’s strategy
must focus on assisting allies as they protect their own IT infrastructure
during an attack (North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undated a).

12

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

Members of NATO have taken several steps in defining a cyber strategy
and implementing a cyber defence. As early as 2002, at the Prague Summit,
cyber defence appeared on NATO’s agenda. At the Prague Summit
NATO leaders agreed to the implementation of a NATO Cyber Defence
Program. The program consisted of a NATO Computer Incident
Response Capability and for NATO to use the latest cyber defence
measures (North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undated a). In the spring of
2006 cyber defence was made a priority for NATO during the Riga
Summit. The issue of cyber security gained even more attention when
Estonia, a NATO member, was cyber attacked in 2007 (EU News, Policy
Positions & EU Actors online, 2008).
NATO conducted a thorough assessment of its IT structure and how it
would defend itself against a cyber attack. This assessment led to an
October 2007 report on cyber defence that was issued to the Allied
Defence Ministers. The report recommended measures to improve
protection against cyber attacks (North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
undated a). What followed was a cyber defence policy in early 2008 and the
creation of a NATO Centre of Excellence for cyber defence in May 2008
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 2008a). In April 2008, during the
Bucharest Summit, cyber defence was part of the summit declaration. The
declaration emphasizes the need to protect key information systems, the
sharing of best practices, and for Allied nations to provide assistance to
counter a cyber attack (North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 2008b).
Even though not all NATO nations are part of the Cyber Defence Centre
the centre works to enhance the cyber defence capabilities of all NATO
members. The centre itself is not even funded by NATO but by the
nations that participate in the running of the centre of excellence. The
centre has been charged with doctrine and concept development,
awareness and training, research, development, analysis, and lessons
learned. The experts at the centre also serve as cyber defence consultants
for NATO members North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undated b).
The compelling reality for NATO is that cyber warfare has affected
member nations and continuous to be a realistic threat for the organization
and for its members. NATO members are continuing to develop ways to
counter future threats by sharing best practice information, information on
technical cyber defences, and by agreeing to assist member nations in
countering a cyber attack.

6. Multilateral initiatives
Only a few international treaties on cyber security exist making
international cooperation to prevent cyber attacks extremely difficult. Even
finding and then holding accountable a person that commits a cyber crime
is almost impossible without some international cooperation (Organization
for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, 2008). In the aftermath of the
cyber attacks on Estonia the European Union commissioned a study to
examine the issues concerning cyber security facing members of the
European Union. This section will examine the European Union study and
other multinational initiatives that have an impact on the cyber security of
former Soviet satellites and Russia. (Cornish, 2009)
6.1. Convention on Cybercrime
The Council of Europe has established a treaty on cyber crime that entered
into force 5 in 2004. Twenty-two Council of Europe member nations, along
with the United States, have ratified the treaty agreeing to international
cooperation concerning cybercrime issues. The Russian Federation has not
agreed to the treaty making it difficult for states to resolve issues with
Russia concerning cyber crimes in an international forum (Council of
Europe, undated a). This treaty is still significant because it is the first
international treaty on crimes committed on the internet (Council of
Europe, undated b).
The main goal of the convention, as stated in the preamble, is to protect
nations against cybercrime, by adopting laws and regulations, and fostering
co-operation internationally. The states that become a party to the
Convention on Cybercrime agree to adopt laws that create criminal
penalties for committing crimes on the internet. The convention outlines
several areas that states have agreed to make criminal statutes on issues
such as illegal access of computer systems, system and data interference,
and other computer related fraud. Nations that are party to the convention
also agree to cooperate with investigations, to provide mutual assistance
concerning cyber crimes, and to pursue the collection of evidence. The
extradition of alleged cybercriminals is also agreed to by parties to the
treaty. Disagreements between states that have ratified the treaty include
direct negotiations, settlement in front of the European Committee on
Crime Problems (CDPC), a tribunal for arbitration or adjudication in front

14

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

of the International Court of Justice. The Convention on Cybercrime gave
a framework for cooperation among member states for the prosecution of
cyber criminals by removing safe havens for the cyber criminals. (Council
of Europe, 2001)
However, Russia does agree to the convention and it protects citizens who
engage in cyber misconduct by preventing their extradition out of Russia.
Failing to sign the convention agreement also prevents Russia from having
any legal standing to prosecute trans-national cyber criminals who attack
Russia’s IT infrastructure.
6.2. Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has a
tradition of promoting the security and stability of Europe. This tradition
of promoting security and stability since 2004 has included cyber security.
The OSCE’s initial focus on cyber security concerned the use of the
internet for recruiting, fundraising, and communication by terrorist
organizations. In 2006 the OSCE’s efforts began to focus on protecting
vital information infrastructures against cyber attacks. Debate in the OSCE
has not led to great change but has been a forum for further cooperation
in cyber security in Europe. In June 2008, the Estonian Defence Minister,
Jaak Aaviksoo, in an address to members of the OSCE, said there is “an
immense amount of work to be done [concerning cyber security].”
Minister Aaviksoo used the forum of the OSCE to use his nation’s
experience in defending against cyber crime to increase international
cooperation in Europe. This statement by the Estonian Defence Minister
sums up OSCE’s efforts concerning cyber defence, they are still in the
talking phase and have at least recognized the importance of cyber defence
(Cornish, 2009:20-21). The OSCE will continue to be a forum to publicize
grievances for European nations that have had their IT infrastructures
attacked by Russian hackers. European nations will judge Russia on its
cooperation with the OSCE in finding and prosecuting individuals who
engage in cyber attacks.
6.3. The European Union
Estonia continues to lobby for improved international cooperation in
cyber security as it calls on the European Union (EU) to pass legislation
concerning crimes committed on the internet. While addressing the

15

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

European Parliament, Toomas Hendrik, the Estonian President, called
upon the EU to pass legislation that make cyber attacks against public and
private web sites a criminal act (Jones, 2008). The EU has several initiatives
involving different agencies but lacks an overall cyber security strategy. The
European Commission has the Information Society and Media Directorate
General, the European Network and Information Security Agency
(ENISA), and the Contact Network of Spam Authorities that deal with
different aspects of cyber security. The Information Society and Media
Directorate has a program to improve the content of the internet by
protecting people from child pornography, racism, and other harmful
online content. The ENISA is an agency that was created in 2004 to raise
awareness of cyber security issues and to promote best practices by
member nations with the EU. The Contact Network of SPAM authorities
is an initiative to counter SPAM and share information on best practices
between EU member nations. (Cornish, 2009:24-27)
The European Parliament has established several standing committees
concerned with cyber security issues. The Committee on Industry,
Research, and Technology (ITRE) is concerned with establishing
information technology networks within the EU. The Committee on Civil
Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) is responsible of the
protection of personal information on the internet for members of the
EU. The Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible for the Security and
Security policies of the EU which includes internet security policies.
(Cornish, 2009:26)
The European Police Office (EUROPOL) is an agency of the Police and
Judicial Co-operation (PJC) that has more of a direct role in EU cyber
security in the context of combating terrorism, organized crime, and
financial crime (Cornish, 2009:25). Although cyber security is addressed by
the EU there is no organization within the EU to ensure that there are no
contradictions in cyber security policy among all of the various EU
agencies, commissions, and co-operations. The European Parliament
commissioned a study on cyber security published February 2009 that
examined security challenges concerning the internet for the EU. The
study recommended that clear roles should be defined for cyber security
responses with the many EU organizations, including the establishment of
the post of cyber security coordinator and the establishment of a common
operating vision for cyber security in order to achieve operational
consistency across the EU (Cornish, 2009:31). The EU and Russia work

16

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

together on different challenges including drug and human trafficking,
organized crime, and counter-terrorism. Russia is also the EU’s third
largest trading partner (European Commission, 2009). The EU’s cyber
security organizations can offer a framework for increased cooperation to
defeat cyber attacks that originate from or are directed at Russia.
6.4. The United Nations
The main purpose of the United Nations (UN) is to maintain international
peace and security among the different nations of the world (United
Nations, 1945). The focus for cyber security for the UN, through the UN
Security Council, has been on countering terrorism. Debates among the
UN General Assembly started in 2002 highlighted the growing dependence
on IT use. Out of discussions came a warning that law enforcement
activities would not be sufficient but that more efforts in cyber security
need to be made on prevention. (Cornish, 2009:17)
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the main
organization that is responsible for cyber security within the UN
framework. The ITU’s goal is to enhance cyber security in order for
individuals, businesses and nations to have confidence in the use of
cyberspace. The ITU uses its Global Cyber Security Agenda, which began
in 2007, to promote its goals of increased cyber security. The ITU has not
been an agency for the enforcement of legislation and international
agreements concerning cyber security but has focused on assisting in
building nation’s capabilities for cyber security (Cornish, 2009:17-18).
Former Soviet satellites can cooperate with the ITU to improve their cyber
defences against cyber criminals from Russia or any other nation. The UN
will continue to be a forum for Russia to voice grievances or defend
themselves against world opinion in matters involving international peace
and security including cyber security.
6.5. Relevance of multilateral initiatives
Although the Russian government cooperates with Europe and other
nations on a variety of economic and security issues, individuals,
organizations, and governments are able to exploit the weaknesses of the
international system in order to use the internet for criminal activities
without fear of any major reprisals. Significant effort has been made
towards cyber security since the cyber attack on Estonia in 2007, but much

17

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

more needs to be done among national and international organizations to
ensure genuine cyber security. The framework for increasing cyber security
exists, but it will take the cooperation of many nations, including Russia, to
make a difference in cyber security.
7. Implications for the United States
The cyber attack on Estonia should be considered a significant wake-up
call for the United States. Even though the attacks had no direct impact on
the U.S., Estonia is a NATO ally and the attack clearly showed aggressive
intent seeking advantage. When the attacks occurred the U.S. sent experts
to assist and help Estonia with its cyber defences. Jaak Aaviksoo, the
Estonian Defence Minister, was told by U.S. officials that Estonia coped
better than the U.S. is likely could in responding to a cyber attack. The
Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) was able to
concentrate on protecting vital sites by coordinating government and
public efforts. They were also able to create diversions which caused
hackers to attack sites which were already disabled or not very important.
(Collier, 2007)
The cyber attack on Estonia demonstrated the importance of legal
obligations for the U.S. in rendering support to its allies during a cyber
attack (Gee, 2008). The cyber attack also showed the vulnerability of an IT
system, raising the question, if it could happen to Estonia could another
trans-national cyber attack of this magnitude happen in the U.S. (Griggs,
2008)? The convention on cybercrime, which the U.S. is a party to,
outlines principles for providing mutual assistance regarding cybercrime
(Council of Europe, 2001). The convention does not mention cyber
attacks or cyber war but treats such activities as crimes (Korns &
Kastenberg, 2008/2009). Because only 23 countries have agreed to this
treaty, its force in the international community is limited (Gee, 2008).
Several members of NATO are participating in the Cyber Defence Centre
of Excellence that was established in Estonia, but the U.S. only agreed to
the creation of the cyber defence centre as an observer. The cyber defence
centre is working on issues of cyber security that affect NATO along with
the U.S (The Associated Press, 2008). What will the U.S.’s response be if a
cyber attack destroys infrastructure and kills citizens in an allied country,
and then that ally declares war because of the attack? The plausibility of
such an attack was demonstrated in 2007 when scientists from the Idaho

18

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

National Laboratory demonstrated how a cyber attack could cause a power
plant to overload its system, begin to smoke, and then break down which
caused physical damage to equipment. Currently, both international law
and NATO’s framework lack coherent responses that are legal in the event
of such an attack. The cyber attackers could limit options for the U.S.
under such a scenario by routing their cyber attack through countries
which do not have laws or agreements to cooperate with the U.S. The
cyber attacker could remain completely anonymous if the country where
the attack was routed through refused to hand over information identifying
the cyber attackers. (Gee, 2008)
Cyber attacks on the U.S. government IT infrastructure are not new. In
March 1998 a cyber attack was launched against computer systems of the
U.S. government, private universities and research labs computer systems
that lasted for over three years. Government investigators named the
attacks “Moonlight Maze.” The cyber attacks targeted gaining access to
sensitive but unclassified information (Abreu, 2001). John Adams, a
National Security Agency (NSA) consultant says that government
investigators have identified seven internet addresses involved in the cyber
attacks that originated in Russia. Dion Stempfley, a former Pentagon
computer analyst, believes that the U.S. prove that the Russian Federation
government is sponsoring the attacks but there is evidence that they are
allowing or otherwise permitting the cyber attacks. The cyber attacks
which resulted in the theft of technical defence information were serious
enough that the U.S. State Department issued a formal complaint to the
Russian Federation. (Loeb, 2001)
In Global Trends 2025, a study conducted by the National Intelligence
Council, states over the next two decades non-military aspects of warfare,
including cyber, will be prominent (National Intelligence Council, 2008).
According to Secure Works, a cyber security company, in 2008 over 20
million attacks originated from computers within the United States (Secure
Works Press Release, 2008). In 2008 the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security created the National Cybersecurity Centre to counter these threats
(Griggs, 2008). The threats to the U.S. infrastructure and technology are
moving at a much faster pace than the creation of government structures
to counter the threat.
Even a casual observer can see that there is a cyber threat to the U.S., but
how is that connected to any Russian involvement in cyber attacks? There

19

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

are three recent examples of how cyber attacks, that may have allegedly
originated in Russia, that demonstrate danger for U.S. and Russian
relations. These examples show how attacks against an IT structure were
used as cyber pressure to influence nations or organizations.
The first example is when Radio Free Europe’s internet sites in April 2008
in Eastern Europe were shut down because of a denial of service attack.
The attack lasted two days and coincided with the planned coverage of the
anniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The attacks effectively shut
down the websites which stopped the flow of information from Radio
Free Europe, a U.S. sponsored program (America.gov, 2008).
Another example is the malware (malware is a term used to identify illegal
computer access including computer viruses) attack on U.S. Department of
Defence computer systems in November 2008. According to WMD
Insights 6 the computer attacks are thought to have originated from Russia.
The attacks seemed to target military computer systems and affected the
U.S. central command along with computers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The
attacks led to a ban on the use of external computer flash drives on
military computers throughout the world. (Melikishvili, 2008/2009)
The latest example of an attack that may have originated in Russia is the
January 2009 denial of service attack that was directed at the government
websites of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. One theory on why the attack was
started was because of Kyrgyzstan’s support of the U.S. in its war on terror
in Afghanistan. This shows the significance of a cyber attack not directed
against the U.S. but against one of its allies. (Rhoads, 2009)
One senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, D.C. believes there is no adversary that can defeat the U.S. in
cyber space. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
commented that the U.S. government is able to protect itself from cyber
attacks, but the U.S. IT system is not completely impenetrable. The
director of a non-profit research institute, the United States Cyber
Consequences Unit, stated that because the U.S. controls so much internet
bandwidth that most of the people that want to harm the U.S. lack the
capabilities to shut down U.S. servers. (Griggs, 2008)
The U.S. faces a wide variety of challenges in protecting its own IT
structure along with facing the reality of the challenges of its allies’ cyber

20

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

defences. In the future the U.S. may face cyber attacks that could cause the
deaths of its or its allies’ citizens due to the effects of a cyber attack on an
electrical system. The U.S.’s bilateral agreements with countries that hold a
strategic U.S. interest could be affected by the use of a cyber attack to
influence leaders. The cyber threats to the U.S. are real and continued
attention by the leaders must focus on this threat.
8. The weakest link – the computer user
As you read this article you could be an accomplice to a cyber criminal
without even knowing that your computer is conducting a worldwide
distributed denial of service attack. The actions or lack of action of
computer users have contributed to the ability of hackers in Russia and
elsewhere to conduct their attacks in relative anonymity. 7 The internet has
vulnerabilities and the individual computer user contributes to the
vulnerabilities of private and government IT systems.
In 1997 the National Security Agency (NSA) conducted an exercise to find
out how vulnerable government IT systems were to external cyber attacks.
They named the exercise “Eligible Receiver.” Thirty-five IT specialists
were given the mission to hack into government systems. They could use
any software programs that were available on the internet and they were
only given a few limitations. The IT specialists couldn’t use any classified
hacking software that belonged to the NSA and they could not violate U.S.
law. The IT specialists were also confined to U.S. government computer
systems. (Verton, 2003:32-33)
What they discovered was how easy it was to hack into government
systems, into both classified and unclassified networks. With the free
software that they downloaded from the internet, the NSA specialists were
able to conduct distributed denial of service attacks, delete or modify
sensitive information and shut down or reformat systems. Along with the
software they used, personal contact methods were also used to gain access
into the systems. The NSA computer specialists would use telephone calls
or emails to gain passwords or entry into a system by posing as a
supervisor or technician. The IT specialists were surprised at how easily
government and military members delivered their passwords without
question. Even though the exercise was conducted in 1997, and may seem
dated, it gives us a great example of how a dedicated effort can disrupt any
IT system. (Verton, 2003:32-33)

21

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

As noted earlier, external flash drives were banned from use with military
computer systems. Authorized users unknowingly passed intrusive
malware files from computer to computer infecting IT systems throughout
the U.S. Central Command. The ban on flash drives complicated the
sharing of information throughout the theatre. The malware file was even
found on a classified network. This is one more example of how an
individual can spread malicious software infecting multiple computer
systems because of a lack of computer security protocols. (Melikishvili,
2008/2009)
One vulnerability that is associated with computer users is that some
people who become hackers are former employees with a grievance against
their former employer. Such people may be motivated by a personal
grudge against the U.S. government because they were fired or lost their
job due to a reorganization or downsizing. Their actions as hackers are
usually malicious in nature as such people steal or corrupt data, deface
websites, or shut down systems. (Conway, 2007:82)
Even more dangerous than an angry former employee is a case of cyber
espionage. This is where an individual who is motivated by money or
ideology sells highly sensitive IT security information. One such case
involves Herman Simm and his wife, Heete Simm, from Estonia
(Melikishvili, 2008/2009). Mr. Simm was arrested in September 2008 for
allegedly passing highly classified information on cyber security and missile
defence to members of the Russian foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Mr.
Simm was the head of the State Secret Protection Office where he was
responsible for protecting Estonia’s classified information. Mrs. Simm was
a lawyer who was previously employed at the Estonian national police
headquarters. Mr. Simm had access to classified information concerning
NATO and allies of Estonia including the operational information of the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre based in Tallinn. If the
Estonian government had access to a secret so did Mr. Simm. The amount
of classified information that was compromised is unknown, but may be
quite large. Mr. Simms allegedly became a Russian spy in the mid-1990’s
and was paid millions of dollars from the Russian Government. Regardless
of how secure a country’s IT structure is, it is still vulnerable because some
people will compromise sensitive cyber security information for personal
gain. (Melikishvili, 2008/2009)

22

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

Along with the vulnerabilities already mentioned there are always problems
with software products. Some software is easy for hackers to take
advantage of because of security deficiencies. Computers may be infected
before the user or software company has identified the problem. Then it
will take time for the software company to produce a security patch. It will
take even more time to get the patch to the computer program user and
for the security patch to be installed. During this time the infected
computer program may have already infected other computers in a system
or throughout the internet. (Wilson, 2006:15-16)
A major vulnerability for any IT system is the computer user. Whether the
computer user is a military member, a government employee, or just a
computer user sitting in front of his computer at home, their practices can
cause serious damage to a computer system. Normal computer users
receive little or no training in the best security practices. (Wilson, 2006:14)
The cost of poor security practices can be high. Along with the loss of data
or the disruption of service there is also the physical cost associated with
malware and viruses. For example, in 2007 the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) uncovered a botnet campaign that caused losses of
over 20 million dollars (Cornish, 2009:9). One of the botnet hackers that
was caught by the FBI and sentenced to prison used botnets to steal
peoples’ identities and bank account information. After gaining access to
personal information and passwords he made on-line purchases and
transferred money from the bank accounts. Another cyber attacker used a
phishing scheme where he collected information through infected emails
(Wired Staff, 2009). This section highlighted how the computer user has
made IT structures even more vulnerable and the Simm affair
demonstrates how cyber espionage adds to that vulnerability. If countries
like the U.S. and Estonia that have highly developed IT infrastructure can
be attacked, it is not hard to imagine the vulnerabilities less developed
former Soviet satellites have in their IT development phase.
9. The Russian Federation
In this article study several cyber attacks have been attributed to Russia.
Regardless of whether the government of Russia is responsible for the
attacks, or merely sanctioned them, for many the perception remains that
Russia was behind the cyber attacks. I will examine Russia’s use of cyber
warfare against former Soviet satellite states. (Davis, 2009)

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

The Russian government views itself as the victim in the case of the cyber
attacks on Estonia in 2007. According to sources in the Kremlin the
website of the President of Russia came under a cyber attack. This was
supposedly the largest attack the Russians have faced and it appeared that
the servers used to originate the attack were located in the Baltic States.
The Deputy Press Secretary of the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov,
countered accusations from Estonia with the fact that Russian government
websites are under attack every day from all over the world. (The Baltic
Times, 2007a)
Even as cyber attacks occurred against Georgia, Russians said that they
were also the victims of cyber attacks. Russia Today 8, a major media source
in Russia, was shut down because of a denial of service attacks directed
towards its websites. IT security specialists that work for Russia Today
believe that the denial of service attacks originated from Tbilisi, the capital
of Georgia. (Watson, 2008)
In the aftermath of the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, and other
attacks mentioned in this article, the Russian response was to deny any
involvement in any cyber attack. When confronted with evidence that
some of the attacks originated from Russian government computers
members of the Russian government countered with the fact that
computers from all over the world were hijacked and used to attack
different computer systems. (The Baltic Times, 2007a)
Another fact that Russian officials are quick to point out is that the only
person arrested for the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia was an Estonian.
Dmitri Galushkevich, a 20 year old ethnic Russian, who was convicted for
the cyber attacks. Some members of the Estonian government have issued
statements doubting the involvement of the Russian government in the
cyber attacks. (Greenberg, 2008)
With the finger pointing that ensues after a cyber attack it is still unclear
who was behind the attacks. The actions of cyber activist groups, or
hactivists, will be examined in the case of the cyber attacks on Estonia and
Georgia. Hactivists are individuals that use cyber attacks to take a patriotic
or political stand on a political or international issue. (Melikishvili,
2008/2009)

24

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

During the protests in Estonia, increased chatter and postings on how to
conduct and participate in denial of service attacks were found on Russian
internet chat sites (Melikishvili, 2008/2009). Along with the denial of
service attacks, some of the Estonian government websites were hacked in
order to deface the site. The sayings on the websites were very pro Russian
and very anti Estonian. Joshua Davis in Wired Magazine supports the view
that the reason behind the attacks was nothing more than Russian pride.
(Davis, 2009)
In March of 2009 a member of a Russian pro-Kremlin youth group,
Konstantin Goloskokov, publicly took responsibility for creating the 2007
cyber attacks on Estonia. Goloskokov is a leader of the youth movement
Nashi that has routinely conducted cyber attacks and intimidation
campaigns on behalf of the Russian government. The government of the
Russian Federation is able to maintain separation from the youth group
because it does not directly fund their activities. The youth groups are
funded by pro-government business owners who are trying to gain favour
from the Russian government (Shachtman, 2009). Goloskokov believes
that his actions were not illegal but were, “an act of civil disobedience
organized within the confines of virtual space” (Buranov, Vodo &
Yegikyan, 2009). The cultural aspects or belief that actions in the cyber
world are beyond the law is a consequence for the Russian government
and how cyber attacks affect their international relationships.
An assistant to Sergei Markov, a member of Russia’s State Duma lower
house, has also admitted to using his own initiative to conduct cyber
attacks against Estonia (Baltic News Service, 2009). Rein Lang, the
Estonian Justice Minister, is contemplating issuing a European arrest
warrant for individuals who have admitted to taking part in the attack. The
idea for the warrant is not to send law enforcement officials into Russia,
but to have the alleged perpetrators arrested whenever they leave the
country (Baltic News Service, 2009). Aleksandr Gostev, director of the
Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, explains that hackers
who participate in a distributed denial of service attack violate the Russian
Criminal Code (Article 274, Violation of the Rules Governing the Use of
Computers, Computer Systems, or Networks Thereof) and can be imprisoned for
four years for violating the code. But he also states that the article is rarely
used (Buranov, Vodo & Yegikyan, 2009). The examples of Russian citizens
admitting to participating in the Estonian cyber attacks are grounds for

25

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Russian citizens to be arrested in other parts of Europe if Russia fails to
uphold its own laws.
Similar actions occurred in the Georgian cyber attacks. Messages were
posted on Russian hacker forums on how to participate in shutting down
Georgian websites. The website StopGeorgia.ru was also established as a
private forum to coordinate the denial of service attacks. Jeff Carr, a
network security expert and cyber analyst, established an all volunteer
group to investigate the cyber attacks. Throughout the course of the
investigation, which they named Project Grey Goose, no evidence was found
to implicate the Russian government. This was just another example of a
hactivist movement which had the collective power to conduct a cyber
attack against a government. (Melikishvili, 2008/2009)
The Project Grey Goose investigation has looked at hactivists and how they
can independently conduct cyber attacks. It also focused on a criminal
gang known as the Russian Business Network (R.B.N.). The R.B.N. is based
in St. Petersburg and engages in criminal cyber activities. According to
Don Jackson, the director of threat intelligence at Secure Works, some of
the cyber attacks used against Georgian websites originated from
computers under the control of the R.B.N. As is the case with any cyber
attacks it is very difficult to establish who is completely responsible or if
there is any Russian government sanctioned involvement. (Markoff, 2008a)
This article has already noted that there are other groups involved with
cyber attacks against former Soviet satellites. The evidence of Russian
government involvement will now be investigated (Davis, 2009). Indeed,
some statements made by Russian government officials suggest Russian
government involvement in cyber attacks. Prior to the cyber attacks in
Estonia the Russian government protested the movement of the Russian
memorial, the Bronze Soldier, to the Estonian government. The Russian
government warned how disastrous the move would be to Estonia. What
followed were the protests and the cyber attacks. (Davis, 2009)
The head of the Russian Army Centre for Military Forecast, Colonel
Anatoly Tsyganok, made comments to the Russian news outlet, Gazeta,
about the cyber attacks on Estonia. He believes that there was nothing
wrong with the attacks because there are no international agreements
established. Colonel Tsyganok also believes that NATO couldn’t do

26

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

anything to stop the attacks, and that they were highly successful.
(prygi.blogspot.com 9, 2008)
The most telling example of Russian government involvement in cyber
warfare was with Herman Simm selling IT secrets to the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service that was discussed earlier in this article. This examples
shows that the government of the Russian Federation is actively seeking
information on cyber defences and is willing to pay large sums of money
(Mr. Simm is accused of selling cyber security secrets for millions of
dollars) to receive information on cyber security. (Melikishvili, 2008/2009)
There are also cases where cyber attacks were used against people who are
in opposition to the Russian government. One such example is with Gary
Kasparov, Russian opposition party leader, had his website shut down for
two weeks due to denial of service attacks during the Russian presidential
campaign. John Palfrey, a researcher at Harvard Law School, believes that
several organizations in Russia who plan to protest, or act in opposition to
the Russian government, are subjected to cyber attacks in an attempt to
control the information that is getting to the public. (Greenberg, 2008)
Another example of Russian government complicity is the lack of
assistance or interest in tracking down those responsible for the cyber
attacks against governments of former Soviet satellites (Davis, 2009). The
evidence of government involvement remains circumstantial, but certain
facts are clear concerning cyber security and former Soviet satellites. If
there is opposition to Russian Federation policy than that country that is in
opposition is likely to be subject to a cyber attack and it has been shown
that the Russian Federation actively collects information on other
countries cyber defences.
10. The future of Russian cyber warfare
The perception exists among different nations (some of those nations have
been discussed earlier in this study) that the government of the Russian
Federation has been involved in cyber attacks. This section will examine
future trends concerning the use of cyber attacks by, or sanctioned by, the
Russian Federation government. The cyber attacks against Estonia and
Georgia have forced Russia to evaluate its future cyber strategy. In
examining the Russian focus on improving its cyber strategy some

27

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

conclusions can be drawn about the future of Russian cyber warfare.
(Panarin, 2008)
As with many countries that have an advanced IT system, a sub-culture of
hacking has developed. Even though the state sponsored university in St.
Petersburg produces computer programmers that are highly regarded it is
believed that most of the hackers are young and not educated at the
university level. The reason behind the growth of Russian computer
hackers is the prestige and monetary reward that hacking garners in a
growing IT infrastructure. (Varoli, 2000)
The criminal organization, R.B.N., has been able to conduct its cyber
activities with little interference from the Russian Federation government.
The R.B.N. is very difficult to track on the internet as they are able to
locate their activities from several different locations. The group has been
involved in several different types of criminal cyber activities such as the
use of malware, identity theft, and child pornography. Without any
concerted effort to stop the R.B.N., and their ability to operate anywhere,
R.B.N. is an organization that is positioned in Russian cyber activities now
and in the future. (Markoff, 2008a)
One example of latitude and scope created by Russian indifference, a
group identified by a computer security firm as a Russian gang conducted a
botnet based computer operation operating in Wisconsin. The Russian
gang was controlling as many as 100000 computers in an effort to steal
passwords and information. As soon as the system was shut down the
Russian gang moved its host computer system to a site in the Ukraine. This
shows how resilient these gangs are when they can relocate their operating
systems to countries that are out of reach of law enforcement of the
country that they are targeting. (Markoff, 2008b)
The Russian responses to the recent cyber attacks are a guide to how they
will react in the future. Valery Yashenko, vice director of the Institute of
Information Security Issues at Lomonosov Moscow State University,
advises the Russian government on the issues of cyber terrorism.
Yashenko believes that there should be greater international cooperation
concerning cyber security but does not think that the cyber attack on
Estonia was of any real consequence. Yashenko indicates that the Russian
Federation government is only concerned with cyber security matters that
affect his own government. (Davis, 2009)

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

Not surprisingly, the Russian Federal Security Service (F.S.B.) is believed
to employ its own hackers (Varoli, 2000). The manner of recruiting is a
little different than normal ways of looking for employees. When an IT
specialist or hacker is caught committing a cyber crime they may receive an
offer to work for the F.S.B., or face criminal charges. According to a
Russian computer security specialist hackers that were working for the
F.S.B. attacked pro-Chechen web sites. According to the same computer
security specialist the F.S.B. hackers have hacked into opposition
newspapers in order to control information about the Russian Federation
government and its leaders. The recruitment of hackers for offensive cyber
attacks vice cyber defences is an indication of the future Russian
Federation government cyber strategy. (Varoli, 2000)
The Russian Federation government has shown the capability for law
enforcement in cyber space. Laws exist in Russia that make crimes
committed on the internet punishable under the law. Russia has even
established a computer crime unit, which it called Department “K,” which
operates under the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation
(MVD). Department “K” is responsible for the detection, prevention,
suppression, and solving crimes involving information technology. In
2008, Department “K” was able to identify 158 computer crimes and shut
down seven illegal internet operations. The MVD is currently conducting
Project “Clean Network” aimed a combating illegal uses of the internet
(Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, undated). It
remains to be seen whether the efforts of Department “K” will have any
negative impact on the R.B.N. or the cyber gangs that support the Russian
government.
The Russian Federation Public Chamber 10 organized a discussion on
Russian information warfare in September 2008 and Just Russia 11 political
party hosted an international conference on information warfare in
October 2008. The conclusions of the meeting were that Russia has grossly
underestimated the role of information warfare and failed to ‘champion’
their goals and interests in the world media. (Panarin, 2008)
Dr. Igor Panarin, the Dean of the Faculty of International Relations of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Diplomatic Academy in Moscow, used the
information warfare discussions to make several recommendations to the
Russian government concerning information and cyber warfare. Dr.

29

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Panarin proposes that Russia develop specialized management and
analytical structures to counter information threats. Dr. Panarin proposes a
system that has eight key components. (Panarin, 2008)
The first component is the creation of a Council for Public Diplomacy that
will develop a single point of view for both the Russian government and
Russian businesses. Government and business leaders are to be included
on the council in order to ensure that all activities concerning foreign
political media are coordinated. The second component is to create an
advisor to the President of Russia for Information and Propaganda
Activities in order to coordinate the foreign political information activities
of the administration of the President, the government, different
ministries, and the Russian Security Council. (Panarin, 2008)
The third and fourth components are to create state holding companies,
one for foreign media affairs and one for the internet. The holding
companies would be combined between business and government to see
that Russian political positions were broadcast to the world. The
information would not just be focused towards ethnic Russians but would
be focused globally towards economic partners, future partners,
adversaries, and overall world opinion. (Panarin, 2008)
The fifth component would be the creation of an information crisis action
centre in order to ensure that Russia maintains the initiative when
delivering the state message to the world. The information crisis action
centre would be responsible for developing talking points and themes that
would support the government in any crisis. (Panarin, 2008)
The sixth component would create an information countermeasures
system that would counter enemy information operations. The information
countermeasures system would include assets from business and the
government. The seventh component focuses on a system on
nongovernmental organizations that would operate throughout the world.
(Panarin, 2008)
The final component would consist of a system for training information
warfare specialists. This system would use existing educational institutions
and academies to train specialists that would be able to operate at the
diplomatic, management, or individual level. The training system would

30

Baltic Security & Defence Review

Volume 11, 2009

also include the creation of an Information Special Forces that are highly
trained to for conducting information operations in a crisis. (Panarin, 2008)
Along with the creation of the information warfare system Dr. Panarin
believes that financing for information warfare needs to be increased by
both the Russian government and by Russian businesses. The increased
attention on information warfare is designed to increase Russia’s image
throughout the world and ensure that Russia is prepared for future conflict
in the cyber and information arenas. (Panarin, 2008)
Statements by Russian government officials have been very similar to Dr.
Panarin’s position which makes the future of cyber warfare in Russia
offensively poised. Colonel Aleksandr Drobyshevskiy, head of the Russian
Federation Ministry of Defence Directorate for Press Service and
Information, stated that Georgia won the information war during the
conflict in South Ossetia and there is a need for the development of
information and telecommunications technologies within the Ministry of
Defence. Colonel Drobyshevskiy further advocates the creation of an
information warfare system. (Svobodnaya Pressa, 2009)
Another clue to the future of Russian cyber warfare is the development of
a new information warfare defensive strategy by the Russian Armed Forces
General Staff. Colonel-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, Deputy Chief of the
General Staff, stated that leading world powers will be able to conduct fullscale information warfare and that Russia must be prepared (Usov, 2009).
General Nogovitsyn believes that Russia will be involved in a large-scale
information war within two to three years that will be fought in the cyber
world (Litovkin, 2009).
The existence of hackers that support the Russian government and
information specialists within the Russian government have created an
asset that will be used during future cyber conflicts. The Russian
government’s emphasis on developing cyber strategies will enable Russia to
be prepared for future cyber conflict.
11. Countermeasures
We need to examine what can be done to counter cyber crimes and protect
a nation’s IT structure. Cyber countermeasures can be taken at the
international level, followed by cyber defences at the national level, and

31

Volume 11, 2009

Baltic Security & Defence Review

ending with actions that an individual computer user can make to improve
cyber defence.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the organization
within the UN that is responsible for the international oversight of the
world’s telephone system, is developing a system for oversight of the
internet. The ITU is working towards a convention against cybercrime that
will provide international cooperation on issues concerning internet
communications (Schrank, 2007). Members of the international
community will need to work together in order to track and prosecute
cyber criminals that operate outside of the country that is being attacked.
Nations will also have to work together to share technical data to maintain
cyber defences to keep up with the newest and ever changing cyber
attacks. Hackers routinely share information on new techniques that can
penetrate IT defence structures. Nations need to do the same to protect
their own IT infrastructure, the same IT structure that affects the entire
globe (Lipson, 2002:47-48).
Individual countries can improve their cyber defences within their own
boundaries which would also improve the cyber security of the
international IT system. Countries can make laws making cyber crimes
illegal with punishments and programs that will deter potential cyber
criminals. Governments can create a system that increases co-operation
between the government, businesses, and academic institutions in order to
improve their cyber defences. This co-operation could lead to an IT
infrastructure that is resilient and able to withstand and recover from a
cyber attack with little or no permanent damage to a country’s IT structure.
(Schrank, 2007)
In 8th section the computer user was identified as the weakest link in an IT
system. Some individual countermeasures are easy to accomplish for any
computer user. Actions like keeping antivirus and anti-spyware software up
to date along with updating your web browser and operating system can
greatly enhance your own computer security. Even following safe
computer practices of not opening unknown attachments on emails that
may carry viruses or malware are very instrumental in making the cyber
environment more secure (Secure Works Press Release, 2008). The U.S.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has tips for computer users
posted on their website to increase internet security. The main points of
the DHS website are to promote personal responsibility for increasing

32

cyber security and to promote best practices for safe computer usage. The
best practices that DHS advertises are to make cyber security a habit by
following three core practices. The three core practices are to “install antivirus and anti-spyware programs and keep them up to date, install a
firewall and keep it properly configured, and to regularly install updates on
your computer’s operating system” (Homeland Security, 2008). Computer
users are the first line of defence in cyber security and their actions can
help protect the cyber infrastructure that is used by all.
Conclusion
The international system is lacking in its ability to effectively manage issues
of cyber security. The Russian Federation is perceived by the international
community as a country that engages in or supports groups that are
involved in cyber crime. International and regional organizations along
with countries that interact with the Russian Federation have to deal with a
reality that they may be the target of a cyber attack if they are in opposition
to the government of the Russian Federation.
The issue of cyber security is ongoing. As more of the former Soviet
satellites become more developed with an advanced IT structure they will
have to face the realities of cyber attacks. Regardless of whether the
government of the Russia Federation has been involved in any cyber
attacks, or will be in the future, the reality remains that nations, groups, or
individuals that are in opposition to Russia may face a cyber attack. The
cyber attacks will be used to influence public opinion or to influence
government leaders through the use of cyber pressure. Future conflicts
that involve the use of force will also see cyber attacks in conjunction with
combat operations. Currently international agreements and laws are
inadequate which allows cyber attackers to take advantage of the lack of
such laws and can conduct acts of civil disobedience on the internet.
The conflict in Georgia has been a motivator for military reform which
includes reform in the cyber arena. The Russian government and the
Russian military will continue to develop systems to improve both their
offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. Russia will continue to capitalize
on their diaspora present throughout the world to support their political
positions but will have to realize that some of that diaspora will be in
opposition to them and provide private support to organizations and
nations that have received cyber attacks. Russia’s active collection of cyber

defence secrets will also be a combat multiplier for them in future conflicts
either alone in the cyber world or as part of a ground conflict.
Organizations and nations will be best served by creating a resilient
defence in depth while educating users and managers of IT systems in best
practices to counter the threat of a cyber attack. This defence in depth
includes technical responses to counter the threats while ensuring that their
IT systems are resilient and become effective after an attack. President
Bush remarked in 2001 that, “It’s time to work together to address the new
security threats that we all face. And those threats are not simply missiles
or weapons of mass destruction in the hands of untrustworthy countries.
Cyber-terrorism is a threat, and we need to work on that together”
(Verton, 2003:248).
