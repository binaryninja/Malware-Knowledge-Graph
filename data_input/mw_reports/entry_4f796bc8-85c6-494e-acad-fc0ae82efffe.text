Mars Stealer malware analysis

Mars Stealer is the latest variant of Oski Stealer. This info stealer can gather data from the
most popular web browsers, including 2FA plugins and multiple cryptocurrency extensions
and wallets.
Mars Stealer is a stealthy and powerful malware with only 95 KB but capable of stealing a
large volume of data. According to 3xp0rt analysis, this is a redesigned variant of the Oski
trojan that stopped its operation in July 2020. Its authors closed the Telegram channel and
stopped all activity, including communication with their clients. Later, in July 2021, Mars
Stealer began to be promoted on a Russian-speaking underground forum. [CLICK IMAGES

How Mars Stealer malware works
Mars Stealer takes advantage of several techniques to be stealthy. The malware strings are
obfuscated and decrypted in run time using the RC4 algorithm and Base64 combinations.

Figure 2: Mars Stealer obfuscated strings.
By implementing a simple strings decryptor, obtaining all the plain-text strings is possible, as
observed in Figure 3. In detail, the RC4 key “86223203794583053453” is extracted from an
initialization function responsible for starting the decryption process. The “key” is also
highlighted below.

After decrypting the malware strings, some internal procedures became more apparent. This
new variant uses anti-analysis techniques, namely anti-debug and emulation procedures.

In detail, the malware obtains the computer name and compares it with a hardcoded string,
probably the development hostname. If it matches, then the malware stops its activity.
Also, queries to the GetUserDefaultLangID() WinCall are performed to skip machines’
infections from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This function can be
disabled when new samples are generated, as observed later.

The malware downloads some target DLLs from its C2 server during its execution. These
DLLs are the malware dependencies used to support all the malicious operations when data
is exfiltrated from popular web browsers. After decrypting the strings, it’s possible to see the
flow responsible for downloading the DLL files into the “C:\ProgramData” folder.

As observed, all the addressed DLLs are available to download on the Mars stealer C2
server along with its web panel, also detailed towards the end of this article.

Mars Stealer web-panel
Mars Stealer is being sold for approximately $160. The files include the web panel with all
needed data to propagate new campaigns and the malware builder to generate new
samples.
Regarding the web panel, a PHP panel with a MySQL database engine is used by criminals
to take control over all the exfiltrated information and victims’ machines. Figure 10 shows the
web-panel structure and the db.php file with the database configuration.

The main dashboard provides information on the collected information, as observed below.

On the other hand, a builder is also provided in the same bundle. This application is capable
of generating new samples of this specific Mars Stealer version (6.1), and some fields can be
introduced, namely:
C2 hostname

C2 gate.php file location (file that receives all the information from victims and
parses them)
Code encryption pass; and
the possibility of disabling CIS check

The threat of Mars Stealer
Mars Stealer is a new and different malware in contrast to other popular and emergent
threats. This piece of software was designed within a stealthy approach, in order to maintain
the threat active for a long time. The real targets of this malware are crypto-wallets, and
because of that, some steps need to be taken to prevent potential infections.
In the first place, backups are a rule of thumb to fight any cyberattack. It’s mandatory to keep
backup copies of your wallet files and their private keys safe and secure.
To circumvent the Mars Stealer’s intent, the usage of wallets that offer offline storage is the
most suitable solution. For instance, using a simple paper wallet for single keys can be very
effective. However, if you need to store a larger volume of crypto assets, consider using a
hardware wallet. These physical devices can store private keys away from your computer
offline and provide an extra layer of security.
Your assets will be safe from potential attacks with this approach in place.
