Doctor Web—the leading Russian developer of anti-virus software —informs users
that its virus analysts have discovered a new threat to computers running Mac OS X.
BackDoor.Olyx is the second known backdoor for the operating system. If a machine
is compromised by the malware, attackers get an opportunity to covertly control the
computer. The backdoor receives commands from a remote server to create, transfer,
rename, delete various files, as well as some other instructions.
The number of malicious programs for MAC OS X is small, especially compared with the
number of threats to Windows. Until recently only one backdoor program for the OS was
known—BackDoor.DarkHole. Versions of this malware exist for Mac OS X and for Windows.
When launched, it enables hackers to open web pages in the default browser on the infected
machine, restart the computer remotely and perform various operations with files. Now, in the
Dr.Web virus database contains entries for both BackDoor.DarkHole and BackDoor.Olyx.

The program gets to a user's computer as an application designed for Macs featuring the
Intel-compatible architecture, BackDoor.Olyx creates the /Library/Application
Support/google/ directory on the disk to which it saves a file named startp. Then
BackDoor.Olyx places the file /Library/ LaunchAgents/www.google.com.tstart.plist into the
home directory, and uses the file to launch the malicious object after a system reboot.

After that the program moves itself to a temporary folder named google.tmp to delete the
executable from its original location. As the name implies, BackDoor.Olyx operates in an
infected system as a backdoor which includes downloading and running malicious files on
infected machines and executing various commands in the /bin/bash shell. Thus, attackers
can gain control over an infected computer without the user's knowledge.
Users of Dr.Web for Mac OS X can rest assured about the security of their computers, since
the signature of the malware has already been added to the Dr.Web virus database. To
prevent BackDoor.Olyx from infecting systems, users of Dr.Web for Mac OS X are
recommended to enable automatic updating and scan their hard drives regularly.
