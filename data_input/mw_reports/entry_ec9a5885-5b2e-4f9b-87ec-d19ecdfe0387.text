EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
When Accenture Security asked CISOs about the risks they face,
71 percent of respondents said cyberattacks are still a “bit of a
black box; we do not quite know how or when they will affect our
organization,” a rise of 5 percent over the year.1 In a more recent
study, only 13 percent of organizations consider future threats
when drawing up their security budgets.2 These responses point to
a clear need for more effective use of actionable threat intelligence.

71% OF RESPONDENTS SAID
CYBERATTACKS ARE STILL A
“BIT OF A BLACK BOX; WE DO
NOT QUITE KNOW HOW OR
WHEN THEY WILL AFFECT OUR
ORGANIZATION.”
Accenture Security iDefense threat intelligence analysts were not
surprised to learn that 71 percent of organizations are still growing and
expanding their knowledge of cyberattacks, hacktivist activities, cyber
espionage, and other cyber threats. Organizations need to enhance
their threat intelligence capabilities to stay ahead of cyber threats,
not just activate their incident response plans when their network is
breached. They need to expand their team’s research capabilities,
their ability to provide strategic insights, and grow their use of cyber
research tools and technologies. Organizations must focus on building
a data-driven approach fueled by threat intelligence to better anticipate
potential attacks and develop a more proactive security posture for their
businesses based on strategic, operational and tactical demands:

Executive summary

What’s inside?
Cyber threat actors and threat groups are continuously networking, researching,
and testing out new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). They are also
always looking for new ways to disrupt operations, make money, or spy on their
targets. iDefense threat intelligence analysts have observed multiple tactical shifts
in terms of victim network targeting, use of attack tools and technologies, and use
of up-and-coming monetary vehicles to attain maximum return on investment (ROI).
In the 2017 mid-year Cyber Threatscape Report, we discussed the continued
development of Iran’s cyber-espionage programs and influence operations. The
expectations of growth in Iran’s cyber-espionage activity described in that report
have been realized. The threats posed by Android malware and ransomware
developed in Iran and used by actors located in Iran are growing and expanding
beyond levels seen prior to the past year. It is not just threat actors located in Iran
from which iDefense threat intelligence is seeing more activity; threat actors and
threat groups across the globe are broadening their attack scope. They are not just
directly attacking chosen targets with spear-phishing campaigns and vulnerability
exploitation; they are looking to reach their targets via the networks of third- or
fourth-party supply chain partners by exploiting weaknesses in less modern
technologies, or by attacking Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of
Things (IIoT) technologies—in the oil and natural gas industry, in particular—that
were not originally designed with cyber defense in mind. The convergence of
information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) is opening doors to
adversaries to disrupt operations, deploy crypto-mining malware, or to conduct
deep-seated espionage operations.
Although the attribution of attacks is improving, and arrests have been made,
when one cyber criminal is captured, a new one quickly emerges. Cyber
defenders must continue to be vigilant and pivot their defense patterns quickly
to meet the evolving attack vectors. Our observations, explored in detail in this
report, identify key areas for concern:

Executive summary

IRANIAN THREAT
IS A GROWING FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH
Iran-based threat actors and threat groups are likely to continue to grow
their malicious activities and capabilities in the foreseeable future.
iDefense threat intelligence analysts have uncovered evidence that the
number of nation-state-sponsored cyberattacks has grown, and this is
likely to continue. iDefense threat intelligence indicates that the Iranian
government and hacktivists located in Iran pose a disruptive or destructive
cyber threat against the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Iran
will likely focus much of its attention on other Middle Eastern nations;
however, Iran-based threat actors have the potential to pivot their attacks
to other nations, consumers, or businesses. Organizations, businesses,
and governments should not ignore the Iran-based threat; they should
proactively build resilience against it, especially against Android-based
malware and ransomware, as Iran-based threat actors will likely use these as
their cyber weapons of choice.
The attack surface for threat actors and threat groups growing and
expanding. iDefense threat intelligence has been closely tracking the
growth in number and types of Android-platform-specific malware. Threat
actors are capitalizing on unofficial or third-party Android application
marketplaces as their key destinations for malicious application delivery
using obfuscation techniques. Threat actors also regularly attempt to
disseminate malicious applications through the official Google Play Store
to appear legitimate and reach a larger installation base.
The development and use of ransomware from Iran is likely to continue.
The increased repurposing of popular malware by Iranian actors could
lead to the use of ransomware for destructive purposes by statesponsored organizations.

Executive summary

EXTENDED SUPPLY CHAIN THREATS

ARE CHALLENGING THE ECOSYSTEM

Organizations should think beyond the enterprise to the full
ecosystem. Future enterprises might conduct business electronically
with hundreds or even thousands of suppliers and partners around
the world, each of which can expose such companies to cyberattacks.
Organizations should work with their ecosystem partners to jointly
protect themselves. Today, however, only 39 percent of companies
say that the data exchanged with strategic partners or third parties
is adequately protected by their cybersecurity strategy.
Cyber adversaries have slowly shifted their attack patterns to
exploiting third- and fourth-party supply chain partner environments to
gain entry to target systems, even in verticals with mature cybersecurity
standards, frameworks, and regulations.
Organizations operate in a complex and challenging environment.
During the past few months, we have collected intelligence on recent
campaigns that highlight the challenges of combatting weaponized
software updates, prepackaged devices, and supplier ecosystems as
these all fall outside the control of victim organizations. iDefense threat
intelligence analysts believe cyber criminal, espionage, and hacktivist
groups will continue to target supply chains and the strategic business
partners that contribute to them for monetary, strategic, and political gain.

Executive summary

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

IS A HIGH-VALUE TARGET FOR THREAT ACTORS
Nation-state-sponsored, hacktivist-driven, and other adversarydriven attacks on IIoT systems are increasing in the utilities, oil and
natural gas (ONG), and manufacturing industries. iDefense threat
intelligence profiled the ONG industry as an example. Adversaries are
taking advantage of the fact that the ONG industry is slowly moving to
digitize its IIoT systems. The current cybersecurity procedures do not
seem to be fully prepared to meet the rapid convergence rates of IT and
OT. In fact, 66 percent of surveyed ONG IT managers said digitization
has made them more vulnerable to security compromises.3
The ONG industry will continue to be an attractive target for threat
actors, given the high number of entry points along the value chain,
rise of IIoT, and the potential damage or disruption that a cyber incident
could inflict on the security and economy of a given oil producing
country. Our analysis indicates that despite the potential increase in
these security vulnerabilities to the OT environment, IT-OT convergence
will continue to grow within the ONG sector.
Threats to the ONG industry will continue to broaden. Organizations
need to adopt a corporate cybersecurity culture that consists of
continuous security awareness and training for all employees, IT teams,
and OT teams. The IT and OT teams need to build strong collaborative
processes and procedures to reduce or prevent future cyber incidents.
ONG industry organizations need to hire new talent to manage
and support emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence
(AI)-based technologies at the upstream level, and should make sure
the IT-OT convergence aligns with the priorities and concerns of both
IT and OT departments.

Executive summary

ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS

ARE BECOMING MORE FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED

Financially motivated cyber criminals are stepping up their game.
Much reporting on advanced persistent threat (APT) cyberattacks
indicates financial attacks are motivated by espionage. Using TTPs
akin to their espionage counterparts, groups such as Cobalt Group
and FIN7 have allegedly been targeting large financial institutions and
restaurant chains successfully.
FIN7 continues to innovate, with analysts having observed a new
version of the Bateleur malware, version 1.1.0, in April 2018. iDefense
threat intelligence finds that FIN7 has been less active in 2018 than in the
previous year, but this decreased activity does not mean this threat is
not present. The FIN7 malware did not include major upgrades from the
previous version (1.0.8) but instead included only minor changes, such as
the addition of a new network traffic encoding prototype function.
Other threat groups have been less active and even dormant. The
leader of the Carbanak and the Cobalt Group was arrested by the
Spanish National Police on March 26, 2018. The Cobalt Group became
dormant in March and April 2018 but renewed attacks in May. This might
indicate new threat group leadership. iDefense threat intelligence will
continue to monitor these groups closely to see how their attacks might
evolve. They might pivot their attention to other industries or other high
ROI cyberattacks.

Executive summary

MINER MALWARE

IS CREATING A CRYPTOCURRENCY SURGE
Cyber criminals have grown their use of cryptocurrency miner
malware. It has been one of the largest growth areas in malware in
2018, and its growth is likely to continue into 2019. Miner malware
rewards its operators with the cryptocurrency mined on infected hosts,
with those victim systems potentially benefiting from rapid fluctuations
in price. Such fluctuations are caused by rampant speculation.
Traditionally, miners have sought Bitcoins due to the currency’s wide
adoption among cyber criminals and legitimate businesses. iDefense
threat intelligence has documented a radical shift toward mining
alternative cryptocurrencies, most notably Monero. Monero can be
more easily and efficiently mined. Tracking Monero transactions is more
difficult than tracking Bitcoin transactions.
GDPR can unleash serious risks for businesses across
the globe. GDPR has had significant effects on the risk calculations
of organizations holding EU subjects’ data. The risk of data theft and
manipulation from external actors remains high, despite the increased
regulatory burden. iDefense threat intelligence analysts assess it is
likely that cyber criminals will try to leverage the threat of GDPR
non-compliance in attempts to extort organizations, especially in
the immediate aftermath of GDPR implementation in May 2018.
iDefense threat intelligence analysts have already identified actors
discussing how to leverage GDPR as a social engineering lure when
communicating with target organizations.

10 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

Executive summary

Ransomware continues to be the most prevalent attack vector for
extortion operations, with attacks against organizations doubling
from 2016 to 2017, rising from 13 percent to 27 percent of all reported
incidents targeting corporations.4 Cyber criminals are innovating their
attack methods and diversifying toward the use of multi-functional
ransom malware—encompassing secondary functionality such as
miner malware or data exfiltration—to ensure a second layer of possible
profitability. iDefense threat intelligence analysts predict that targeted
attack groups will continue to use ransomware, with threat actors
repurposing malware advertised on the criminal underground to deflect
attribution efforts away from APT groups’ use of destructive malware.
Our threat intelligence experts and cyber defenders take great
pride in uncovering cyber adversaries and their tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs). We aim to build tactical and strategic threat
intelligence for our clients to better defend their networks and make
data-driven business decisions to stay ahead of relevant threats to
their business.
The Cyber Threatscape Report 2018 relies on iDefense intelligence
collection, research, and analysis including research using primary and
secondary open-source materials. It covers the increased prevalence
of destructive attacks; the aggressive use of information operations
by nation-states; growth in the numbers and diversity of threat actors;
as well as the greater availability of exploits, tools, encryption, and
anonymous payment systems available to malicious actors.

11 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

WHAT’S HAPPENING?
IRANIAN THREAT IS A GROWING
FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH
Topline assessment:
• Post the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)
annulment, the Iranian government’s behavior has been
defensive. Unless the country is placed under extreme
economic pressure, it is unlikely to pose a disruptive or
destructive threat against the United States or Europe.
However, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain,
and Israel are more likely to face cyberattacks emanating
from Iran.
• The attack surface pertaining to Android devices, specifically
in Iran and other countries where update adoption is low,
will continue to expand. Unofficial and third-party Android
application marketplaces continue to be used broadly and will
increase in availability and utilization. This increased use will lead
to more opportunity for malicious application delivery using
obfuscation techniques through the official Google Play Store in
an effort to appear legitimate and reach a larger installation base.
• iDefense threat intelligence analysts predict that actors in Iran
will continue to develop and deploy ransomware that they
have repurposed from popular malware. State-sponsored
organizations such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
(IRGC) Cyber Command could use such ransomware.

12 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Iran’s geopolitical trends
iDefense threat intelligence has seen a high increase in the number
of cyberattacks, types and uses of ransomware, and malware trade
and usage by threat actors based in Iran; hence, iDefense threat
intelligence is carefully tracking Iranian cyber threats to ensure clients
are adequately protected from this growing and expanding cyber threat.
iDefense threat intelligence analysts predicted that based on the United
States President Donald Trump’s removal of Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson from his position, the nomination of former US CIA Director
Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state, and the appointment of former
US Ambassador to the United Nations (UN) John Bolton as the National
Security Advisor, the Obama-era Iran nuclear agreement better known
as “JCPOA” would end.5 Consequently, the annulment of the JCPOA by
the current United States president has put Iran in a defensive position,
which has led Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (a hardline
cleric) to use harsh rhetoric against the United States president and
the United States as a whole and to threaten to resume Iran’s nuclear
activities, especially if talks with European counterparts fail.6 Although
based on current Iranian policy, the feud may not lead to any disruptive
or destructive cyberattack against the United States or European
counterparts in the near future. The Iranian government is likely to
continue its cyber espionage activities and develop its cyber capabilities
for political and strategic influence; however, it might also take a more
aggressive posture against its neighboring rivals and regional enemies,
such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Israel,
for encouraging and supporting the United States decision on the
annulment of the JCPOA agreement.

13 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

On September 14, 2017, the Director of
National Intelligence, the Honorable Dan
Coats, provided his remarks at the Billington
Cybersecurity Summit, stating, “Iran and
North Korea are improving their capabilities to
launch disruptive or destructive cyberattacks
to support their political objectives.” Office
of the Director of National Intelligence.
iDefense threat intelligence analysts believe that a result of political
tensions stemming from the possible abolishment of the JCPOA
agreement will be that the IRGC Cyber Command is highly likely to
resurrect its cyber threat activity against organizations in multiple
industry sectors such as the financial, critical infrastructure, healthcare,
government, and military, and energy sectors; consequently, iDefense
threat intelligence assesses operational and economic risks to these
organizations are likely to increase.7

Iran’s cyber espionage
Growing POWERSTATS malware family activity
iDefense observed that the POWERSTATS malware family activity is
on the rise and continuing to evolve, as seen in targeted attacks that
Palo Alto Networks has dubbed “Muddy Water.”8 POWERSTATS is a
PowerShell-based first-stage backdoor that uses and drops scripts to
contact a command-and-control (C2) server. The malware performs
14 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

reconnaissance on a victim system, lowers its Microsoft® Office security
settings, and can execute any PowerShell command the threat actor using
it sends. This threat activity was first observed and disclosed by iDefense
threat intelligence in 2017; however, it has continued to blossom in 2018.
The first generation of POWERSTATS malware used basic PowerShell and
VBScript and has grown in complexity and sophistication, mainly due
to the public reporting of its activities. This evolution has included more
sophisticated and more advanced infection and evasion techniques,
such as AppLocker bypass methods, malware analysis tool detection, antisandbox checks, extended C2 proxy lists, base64 encoding, and PowerShell
obfuscation that is more layered. In addition, new infection vectors have
been observed; they include infection via a Java-based version coupled
with a BurpSuite-KeyGen and a malicious Microsoft Help file.
In initial reporting from October 2017, iDefense threat intelligence attributed
this activity with moderate confidence to Iran-based actors. Evidence of
specific strings and metadata found within the malware has strengthened
our assessment of the malware’s Iranian origin; additionally, the malware’s
continued changes are consistent with the identified threat group behind
this malware. Deep familiarity with this threat group has enabled iDefense
threat intelligence to identify previously undetected and unreported samples
that have assisted in tracking this group. Furthermore, a third party posed as
a victim and participated in sessions with the hacker behind this malware,
enabling the third party to discover a tradecraft error made by the operator:
the exposure of an IP address in Iran believed to be a final endpoint. This
exposed IP address contributed to our assessment.9 In response to this Iranbased attribution by the security community, iDefense threat intelligence has
observed the threat actor embedding Chinese false-flag strings, as reported
in the Security Ownage blog by Mo Bustami, that were added in early 2018 to
cause misattribution and confusion.10
15 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

iDefense threat intelligence has observed this threat group continuing
to focus its targeting on West and Southwest Asia, North Africa, and the
Middle East, most prominently Saudi Arabia. iDefense threat intelligence
has noted that the attacks have been very timely and included the
targeting of Jordan during a period of political turmoil in May 2018.11
Accenture Security fully expects this activity to continue and to evolve, as
public reporting of the group’s TTPs continues to emerge, despite efforts
by Microsoft to securely control PowerShell.12

More PIPEFISH cyber espionage efforts
iDefense threat intelligence has observed the PIPEFISH (aka OilRig)
cyber espionage threat group continues to be active and is advancing
its toolset.13 iDefense threat intelligence assesses that this threat group
has been primarily targeting Middle Eastern entities for surveillance and
espionage objectives in the energy sector. iDefense threat intelligence has
maintained an effective tracking collection of PIPEFISH despite this threat
group’s continuous changes and shifting of techniques. It has consistently
shown a propensity to reuse metadata, IP infrastructure, components of
lure documents, and domain registrants, which has enabled analysts to
produce high-confidence intelligence against the group.
iDefense threat intelligence analysts identified new ISMDoor variants in
early 2018; these variants included an information stealer and remote
administration tool (RAT) that was consistent with previous samples
created by this threat group.14 However, in a radical change to earlier
variants, this new ISMDoor implant does not visibly implement any
persistence mechanisms. Accenture Security believes that the C2 human
operator may manually download additional backdoor stages, establish
implants, or create scheduled tasks in the compromised machine to
achieve persistence in the absence of the persistence module in the
ISMDoor. It remains unclear if the persistent component of the malware is
16 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

removed to avoid detection or is performed manually to create tailored
persistent access based on an interactive operator’s assessment of the
targeted system. In addition, communication from the malware was
performed via the Domain Name System (DNS), which is weak to atomic
domain identification and may indicate the use of manual persistence as
a method to preserve the longevity of malicious DNS infrastructure.
iDefense threat intelligence also observed activity from a new Trojan
from the PIPEFISH Iranian threat group. Palo Alto Networks named this
Trojan the “OopsIE trojan”; it is a .NET-based, packed and obfuscated
malware.15 This malware uses the Internet Explorer application object to
disguise its communications to make them look like they are part of a
legitimate browser session. This Trojan has the ability to execute remote
commands and to upload and download files from the victim system.
In addition, iDefense threat intelligence analysts attributed a newly seen
PowerShell backdoor to PIPEFISH: the PRB Backdoor, which was named
after the function used in the final PowerShell script payload.16 iDefense
threat intelligence observed this malware targeting companies in Egypt,
matching previous threat-actor interest in civil aviation organizations
in the region. Third-party analysis has linked an IP address to the
resolution of a C2 domain associated with the PIPEFISH infrastructure.
It is noteworthy that this PowerShell backdoor shares some similarities
(obfuscation and substitutions) with the POWERSTATS backdoor, which
may indicate code reuse by the “Muddy Water” actors in Iran. While
these backdoors are different, their similarities are significant enough
to enable analysts to conduct additional monitoring and tracking
of the backdoors’ repurposed code and may indicate an interesting
reorganization or strategies of Iranian cyber threat groups.

17 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Iran-based ransomware
Global ransomware attacks have dramatically increased in number over
previous years and have caused millions of dollars of data recovery costs,
brand damage recovery costs, operational costs, insurance costs, and
other expenses to organizations. Since October 2016, iDefense threat
intelligence has identified a number of Iran-based ransomware, indicating
that Iranian cybercrime actors are likely to be financially motivated to target
global organizations by using ransomware and cryptocurrency miners for
financial gain.17 iDefense threat intelligence has also identified that Iranbased ransomware developed in Iran or used by actors located there is not
only limited to the Windows operating system but also is being developed
to compromise and encrypt Android mobile devices.18 iDefense threat
intelligence has analyzed and identified at least two ransomware samples
(TYRANT and RASTAKHIZ), both of which were repurposed by a single
actor.19 The emergence of Iran-based threat actors and groups developing
Iran-based ransomware, in addition to carrying out threat activities and
sophisticated TTPs, opens a new cybersecurity challenge for global
organizations. The rise of state-affiliated cybercrime, as seen with Mabna
Institute and its for-profit massive data theft of intellectual property from
various universities and private sector organizations, provides a different
perspective on Iran-based cyber criminals, their TTPs, and how they shared
data with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for future research and
development (R&D).20
iDefense threat intelligence identified the following ransomware variants

Iranian android malware
Analysis of multiple malware families in 2018 has shown continued use of
the “Application Update” lure for regionally specific applications. Attacks
using update lures have been primarily targeting users of messaging and
social media platforms (such as, Telegram, Facebook). More-targeted
espionage campaigns have gone so far as to create new platforms to
act as a new form of watering hole whereby the platform operates as
expected, but is designed to compromise the device through which
a user is accessing the platform. As most Android malware families
originating from and targeting users within Iran are not available in the
official Google Play store, probably due to its strict code policies, these
malware families are likely disseminated via social media and unofficial
Android marketplaces such as Myket. While there have been examples
of threat actors successfully propagating and distributing malware via
Google Play, their success is limited in number probably due to the
safeguards and security controls that Google Inc. has implemented.
An overall increase in the number of malware families using multi-stage
mechanisms in a manner similar to PE32/PE64 infection chains, whereby

23 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

different payload stages are selected based on reconnaissance and an
assessment of the victim host, increasingly, has been seen in the wild
and within targeted campaigns. The following describes how a targeted
malware family attack chain may unfold:
1. The victim opens a benign Microsoft® Office document that has an
inline link within the document’s body.
2. The victim clicks the link, which leads to the downloading of a
malicious Android application package (APK) from a compromised
or owned threat actor infrastructure.
3.The Android app continues with the theme and deception of the
original document, prompting the victim to either enable Device
Administrator access or install a downloader and staging component
on the Android device.
• Users are often additionally prompted to enable a developer or
“non-trusted” application installation.
4. If Device Administrator is enabled, a full-featured RAT is installed or
an additional payload is retrieved and installed after the malware has
completed an assessment of the device.
Due to the nature of bring your own device (BYOD) policies and the
inclusion of Android devices on corporate networks, analysis of select
(generally more targeted) campaigns have shown Windows (PE32/PE64)
executable files being embedded within Android applications. iDefense
threat intelligence analysts presently believe this is being done in an effort
to use Android devices as an additional entry point to Windows corporate
networks. This enables malicious actors to bypass security boundaries
and information flow controls by utilizing an Android’s cellular data
network to bridge a targeted corporate network when the mobile device
is plugged into the corporate system for charging or data sharing.

24 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

The most prominent change observed within the context of Android
malware analysis has been developers’ increased focus on evading
detection. The primary methods of evading detection seen within newer
versions of Android malware are as follows:
•

Java reflection and basic string obfuscation (to evade static detection
of malware behavior as well as C2 definitions within the application).

•

Rotation of C2 servers that provide final-stage domain and IP address
destinations within the body of response content from the Web
server (to evade static and dynamic detection).

•

Embedded resource files called by the application instead of being
defined within standard code body and functionality.

•

Code packing and class obfuscation.

•

Definition of C2 domains and IP addresses within XML fields rather
than standard function calls.

Iranian threat trends and predictions
Iranian ransomware development will continue to improve in the
future to evade detection. Iranian cybercrime actors may have
been using the aforementioned ransomware as test beds for their
future attacks against foreign targeted entities or organizations, as
targeting Iranian victims is against Iran’s cybercrime laws. Cybercrime
actors in Iran are now more capable of using, mining, or exchanging
cryptocurrencies, as Iranian nationals are becoming more and more
familiar with blockchain technology and are better at understanding
the concept of cryptocurrencies. The development and repurposing
of ransomware on both desktop and mobile platforms may also be
used for blackmail or extortion.

25 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Exploitation of the Android platform will continue to expand, especially
in regions where adoption of current operating system versions is
significantly lower. The availability and delivery of updates from
telecommunication providers via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms will
continue to be insufficient for users to apply regularly, further exposing
end users to threats, such as by enabling them to inadvertently install
spyware, keyloggers, or RATs by a malicious third party. Unofficial
Android marketplaces will also continue to increase in number, enabling
threat actors to infect more devices at an increasing rate. Threat actors
will continue to attempt to utilize legitimate mechanisms (such as,
Google Play) to facilitate malware distribution. Due to the level of
persistence and complexity that malware can have when it is present in
Google Store, iDefense threat intelligence analysts believe this avenue
will continue to be used primarily in highly focused cybercrime or
espionage campaigns.

EXTENDED SUPPLY CHAIN THREATS ARE
CHALLENGING THE ECOSYSTEM
Topline assessment:
• Third- and fourth-party environments provide adversaries with an
entry point, even in verticals with mature cybersecurity standards,
frameworks, and regulations.
• Recent campaigns highlight the challenges of combatting
weaponized software updates, prepackaged devices, and supplier
ecosystems as they fall outside the control of victim organizations.
• Cyber criminals, espionage, and hacktivist groups will continue to
target supply chains for monetary, strategic and political gain.

Supply chains are an integral component for enterprises as they work
to bring their products and services to market. Consisting of Nth parties,
supply chains are a robust web of large, medium, and small firms that
underpin the operations of nearly every organization globally. With
such an important role to play, these networks are attractive targets
for nefarious cyber activity perpetrated by cyber criminals, hacktivists,
and nation-states. Threat actors have identified supply chains as being
effective means of infiltrating or affecting victim organizations. Even
verticals in which companies have bought into the maintenance of
mature security hygiene or in which the regulatory landscape has forced
such adoption, supply chains still present openings. Firms that are
cornerstones of the supply chains of other institutions bear the burden
of evaluating threats as both suppliers and consumers.

27 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Supply chains are not homologous across every organization; however,
there are higher-level groupings to which threats can be aligned.
Successful attacks involving the supply chain of affected organizations
have included software and hardware weaponization, data theft (IP data,
personally identifiable information, insider information, etc.), logistics
disruption, and intrusions (watering holes, e-mail compromise, etc.).

Overview
Attacks against supply chains have been both opportunistic and
targeted. Vulnerabilities with global impact, like Meltdown and
Spectre, have exposed a vast pool of potential organizations that
could be affected via commodity campaigns. False patches laced
with Smokeloader quickly appeared following the end of the embargo
placed on the disclosure of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.21
Periods of widespread vulnerability disclosure provide opportune times
for actors to distribute malicious communications to users anticipating
updates. Targeted attacks against technology supply chains can be
especially damaging. The devastating Petya pseudo-ransomware
outbreak on June 27, 2017, showed security practitioners worldwide,
throughout all verticals and in both public and private sectors, that
even attacks intended for limited targets can inflict massive collateral
damage on companies with operations in targeted countries or sectors.
The attacks, which leveraged widely used applications for financial
document-delivery, showed the risks of third-party software and
services in the supply chain.22 While there are tried-and-tested methods
of attack, preemptively identifying unique software and technologies
within a potential target organization is crucial when forecasting where
attackers may look to direct their future activity.

28 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Cyber espionage and the supply chain
Nation-state threat groups have evidenced interest and aptitude in
executing supply chain attacks. Suspected Chinese and Russian threat
groups have targeted infrastructure with supply chain implications.
Compromise of the CCleaner software that Avast developed was
used by PIGFISH to perform targeted attacks against specific victim
organizations.23 PIGFISH is a likely Chinese cyber espionage group
that Accenture Security believes has dual goals of fulfilling information
collection requirements and simultaneously gaining access to
additional supply chain attack capabilities and resources.24 BLACK
GHOST KNIFEFISH, a Russian group, has heavily targeted oil, natural
gas, energy production, manufacturing, pharmaceutical, education,
and IT firms.25 In 2014, the group successfully compromised software
produced by three industrial control systems (ICS) equipment providers
in Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium. The infected software was
installed by countless victims and led to hundreds of successful
compromises throughout Europe. Software supply chain tampering by
resourced nation-state or criminal groups will continue to be used as a
delivery method for increasingly sophisticated malware families like the
SHADOWPAD backdoor Trojan that PIGFISH used.26

Third-party concerns
Across multiple ecosystems, third-party providers are often leveraged
for business tasks such as conducting transaction settlements and
customer assistance. The compromises of processors and even chatbot
services expose a vast external attack surface to which businesses
in the digital age are connected. The late March and early April 2018
breach of Latitude Technologies’ third-party software for an electronic
data interchange (EDI) system led to the disruption of scheduling and
other EDI-mediated services for at least four pipeline companies.27
29 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

This incident came at a time of heightened international tension and
highlighted the kinship verticals share through mechanisms like data
interchanges, which are employed independently in both the oil and
gas, and financial services industries. Additionally, actors such as Joker’s
Stash have advertised large credit card dumps in recent months, with the
common points of exposure for their victims being spread across retailers
around the world. The entry point for attackers during these compromises
has often been through third-party environments. In more severe
instances, delayed remediation of such breaches in retail environments
has led to the repeated closing and reissuance of cards.

Implications for national security
An ongoing subject of debate is the risk associated with deploying
technologies manufactured in or associated with adversarial nations.
Government mandates addressing this issue demonstrate the supreme
concern Nations have regarding the use of software, firmware, and
hardware that is potentially weaponized or weakened prior to delivery.
Nations including the United States, China, North Korea and Russia have
been accused of leveraging or compromising domestic technology
suppliers to support espionage efforts abroad.
iDefense threat intelligence has identified an additional, pertinent
example: a Russian information security services company with a
presence in numerous countries.28 Companies like this one, which
operate in the shadows, are a considerable threat to the environments
of unassuming organizations and their suppliers. Stringent third-party
risk assessments, supported by threat intelligence, can aid in steering
technology strategy discussions.

30 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Evolving legislative environment
In response to heightened attention focused on third-party threats, the
legislative and regulatory landscape addressing supply chain risks from
a cyber threat perspective is undergoing a period of resurgence. In the
United States, bills have been proposed that highlight cybersecurity risks
in federal supply chains and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act (FASCSA)29 and the
Small Business Advanced Cybersecurity Enhancements Act ,30, 31 are not
being created in a vacuum, as other nations are also taking considerable
steps to evaluate supply chains.
The threat of cybercrime and espionage focused on supply chains is
multidirectional, and mitigation methods for supply chain weaknesses
are being addressed as part of larger strategic goals.
iDefense threat intelligence anticipates that cyber threat actors motivated
by financial, political, or ideological gain will increasingly focus attacks on
supplier networks with weaker cybersecurity programs. As adversaries
continue to use trusted third parties as vectors of intrusion, attribution
and thus intent will become more challenging. This is especially the
case for multifunction activities, like state-sponsored hacktivism, where
target organizations may have a difficult time discerning commodity from
targeted activity. An increasingly complex attack and intrusion vector,
supply chains should be considered an inherent component of IT and OT
threat models. Third-party assessments, audits, and enhanced monitoring
should be considered essential pieces of supply chain defenses.

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS A
HIGH-VALUE TARGET FOR THREAT ACTORS
Topline assessment:
• Current cybersecurity practices in the oil and gas industry do not
seem to be fully prepared to meet the rapid rates of convergence
of IT and OT. One survey of OT cyber risk managers found that
66 percent of respondents believed digitization has made their
organizations more vulnerable to security compromises.32
• The oil and gas industry will continue to be an attractive target
for cyber threat actors, given the number of points of entry along
the value chain, the rise of the IIoT, and the potential damage or
disruption that a cyber incident could inflict on the security and
economy of a given oil-producing country.
• Despite the potential increase in security vulnerabilities to the
OT environment, IT-OT convergence will continue to grow within
the oil and gas sector.
• Oil and gas organizations need to adopt a cybersecurity culture
that includes security awareness and training for both IT and OT
teams and that fosters collaboration between teams to reduce
and prevent future incidents. The industry needs to hire talent
to manage and support emerging technologies, including AIbased technologies at the upstream level, and ensure that IT-OT
convergence aligns with the priorities and concerns of both
IT and OT departments.

32 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Overview
Digitization in industrial and manufacturing industries, including the oil
and gas industry used here as a case study, is providing companies with
the opportunity to improve their bottom lines, but has created changes
in the cyber threat landscape that could erase those profits if digitization
is not properly managed. In fact, recent technological progress in big
data and analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, sensors, and
control systems has enabled industrial, manufacturing, and of course
ONG companies to significantly reduce operations and business costs
by automating high-cost, dangerous, or error-prone tasks.33

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a
network of sensors and devices connected to
machinery in industries such as oil and gas,
energy, and transportation.
This progress was made possible by digitization and the rapid growth
of the IIoT, which enabled the convergence of IT and OT—that is, the
equipment and processes that control industrial production. These
two systems have traditionally operated as independent networks with
different objectives, functions, and requirements within the oil and gas
industry but, increasingly, are integrated, exposing potentially dangerous
physical processes to malicious activity conducted over the Internet.

33 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

State of cybersecurity in oil and gas
The increasing convergence of IT and OT service providers, which
Gartner predicts will reach 50 percent by 2020,34 has exposed the
OT environment to greater security threats that current cybersecurity
practices in the oil and gas industry do not seem fully prepared to meet.
Some of the vulnerabilities of ICS or OT are inherent to such systems
and include the use of legacy software, default configurations, lack
of encryption, and lack of network segmentation. Others are due to
increasing network connectivity using IIoT with no embedded security.
•

In a 2017 survey of United States oil and gas cybersecurity risk
managers conducted by the Ponemon Institute, 66 percent of
respondents said that digitization has made their organizations
more vulnerable to security compromises, and about 68 percent
had lost confidential information or experienced disruption of their
operations over the year prior to taking the survey. Only about onethird of respondents viewed their organization’s OT cyber readiness
as high while the majority considered their current cybersecurity
measures as inadequate at keeping pace with the increasing rates
of digitization in the industry.35

•

 nother survey of IT, and ICS, and supervisory control and data
A
acquisition (SCADA) security practitioners that the SANS Institute
conducted in 2017 showed that about 69 percent of respondents
considered threats to ICS systems to be high or severe, and
44 percent considered unsecured IIoT devices added to the network
to be the top threat vector to their ICS. This data compares to the
only 35 percent of respondents who viewed extortion, including
ransomware, to be a top threat vector.36

34 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Increased targeting: Threat actors
The oil and gas industry tends to be an attractive target for threat
actors, including state-sponsored actors, cyber criminals, hacktivists,
and insider threats, given the large number of entry points along the
industry’s business cycle and the potential damage or disruption that
an incident could inflict on the security and economy of a given oil
producing country. Several cyber threat types target the oil and gas
industry, and some may have a significant impact. Examples include
both destructive threats and disruptive threats such as resource theft.

Destructive incidents
Triton, a recently emerged destructive malware threat, alters and
disrupts the operations of safety instrumented systems (SIS). These
process control systems are commonly used in industrial units across
multiple verticals, including oil and gas, utilities, and other energyrelated industries, to enable the controlled shutdown of an industrial
process when it has encountered unsafe operating conditions.37
Unknown threat actors have deployed this malware, which is specially
designed to exploit weaknesses in ICS and SCADA systems, in at
least one critical infrastructure facility, apparently with the intent of
developing the ability to cause physical damage.
Upon discovering third-party reports of Triton infections, iDefense threat
intelligence researchers captured the full scope of related malware
modules and thoroughly analyzed their sub-components. Based on
our internal hunting systems and telemetry data, iDefense threat
intelligence assesses with high confidence that entities in the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia (KSA) were among the targets of the initial campaign
deploying this malware.
35 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Disruptive incidents
Third-party service provider
In late March 2018, third-party software for an EDI system widely used by
pipeline companies was compromised, resulting in the shutdown of the
EDI service.38 Although the breach was not the first cyber threat attempt
on United States gas pipelines, which did not seem to affect the flow of
natural gas, and affected only a few companies, the incident highlighted
concerns within the energy industry of possible disruption to business
transactions via the theft of intellectual property, the risk of interruption
to operations, and increasing vulnerabilities introduced to operational
systems by third-party service providers along the industry’s supply chain.
Crypto-jacking on ICS and SCADA systems
In early February 2018, Radiflow reported the first incident of Monero
cryptocurrency mining malware on a SCADA system in a water utility
environment. The analysis showed that the malicious mining activity
sapped computing power and network bandwidth. Activity like this
could negatively affect the response times of devices used to monitor
physical changes in an OT network. A large amount of the Monero
malware has been known to damage security devices to allow the
malware to remain undetected.39
The following developments are likely to increase incentives for state
actors to sponsor cyber threat activities:
•

The United States is projected to be a net oil and gas exporter by
2022.40 If this projection comes to fruition, the United States will
directly compete with Russia in the European market. Russian
state actors could sponsor disruptive or espionage-related cyber
operations or support hacktivists in the name of protecting the
environment to contain new competition to its largest energy market.

36 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

•

Newly imposed sanctions on Iran are likely to push that country
to intensify state-sponsored cyber threat activities in pursuit of its
geopolitical and strategic objectives at the regional level, particularly
if Iran fails to keep its European counterparts committed to the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement.

•

Rising oil prices could create incentives for North Korea to launch
ransomware attacks and other financially motivated cyber threat
activity such as cryptojacking, which the country has done before
to raise money for fuel purchases.

Mitigation methods and recommendations
Given the potential gains in reducing operations and business costs through
automation, particularly at the upstream level, IT and OT convergence
will continue to grow within the oil and gas sector despite the potential
increase in security vulnerabilities to the OT environment. The following
recommendations are likely to assist in mitigating cyber risks:
•

Promote a cybersecurity culture that consists of providing security
awareness and training for both IT and OT teams, and foster collaboration
between these teams to reduce or prevent future intrusions.

•

Invest in cybersecurity and operational team training to make sure
that system processes are considered with cybersecurity in mind.

•

Hire talent to manage and support AI-based technologies at the
upstream level.

•

Ensure that IT-OT convergence aligns with the priorities and concerns
of both IT and OT departments.

•

Evaluate all third-party service providers along the entire value chain
of the business.

ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS ARE
BECOMING MORE FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED
Topline assessment:
• iDefense threat intelligence observes that FIN7 has been quieter in
2018 than in the previous year.
• FIN7 continues to innovate with the new Bateleur version (1.1.0),
observed in April 2018; however, this was not a major upgrade from
the previous version (1.0.8), as it included only minor changes, such
as the addition of a new network-traffic-encoding prototype function.
• The Spanish National Police arrested the leader of the Carbanak
and Cobalt Groups on March 26, 2018.
• The Cobalt Group became dormant in March and April 2018 but
renewed attacks in May.

Overview
While much reporting indicates that APT cyberattacks are espionage
motivated, financially motivated cyber criminals have also been stepping
up their game since as early as 2013. Using TTPs akin to their espionage
counterparts, groups such as Cobalt Group and FIN7 have been targeting
large financial institutions and restaurant chains with much success. The
Cobalt Group alone is said to be responsible for causing 1 billion euros
worth (US$1.17 billion) of damage to the financial sector.41 The distinction
between espionage and financial APTs is further blurred by state-sponsored
threat groups like NEEDLEFISH (aka Lazarus) that carry out
both types of attacks using very similar TTPs, further highlighting the
changing threat landscape for organizations that would otherwise not
be considered legitimate targets for espionage attacks.
38 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

iDefense threat intelligence has been actively tracking financially motivated
threat groups over the past 24 months, with FIN7 and Cobalt Group being the
two most active and capable groups on the iDefense threat intelligence radar.

Background
FIN7
Often associated with the original Carbanak gang, FIN7 is a financially
motivated syndicate that uses the Carbanak malware as part of its TTPs
but has a distinctive preference for using script-based backdoors as firststage backdoors to establish persistent access to a compromised system
and plant additional payloads. This group commonly spear-phishes with
malicious RTF documents (see Figure 2) to deliver a first-stage backdoor to
its intended targets.

FIGURE 3
Victimology of FIN7 by vertical and country
Based on our observation of FIN7’s activities, including the group’s
frequency of attacks and tool innovation, analysts assess with high
confidence that the group is highly skilled and well resourced.
Malware families that FIN7 uses include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

A script-based first-stage malware known as HALFBAKED
A script-based first-stage malware known as BELLHOP
A script-based first-stage malware known as Bateleur
Meterpreter
Cobalt Strike BEACON

According to iDefense threat intelligence’s telemetry, FIN7 targets
the verticals and countries in Figure 3.

40 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

FIGURE 4
Evolution of Bateleur functionalities
Evidently, Bateleur is a highly versatile and lightweight first-stage
backdoor, and the continued development of the malware suggests
that the group has been having success using this tool.
Bateleur version 1.1.0 uses the Schedule tasks named “Adobe Acrobat
Updater” and “Adobe Acrobat Player Update” to ensure the Bateleur
script is executed every time a Windows session starts.
Cobalt Group
Cobalt Group was first publicly named and reported in October 2016.
The group has continued to be actively targeting financial services
organizations predominantly in Russian-speaking countries, but also
in the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Figure 5 shows the
verticals and countries that the Cobalt Group targets.

waves of attacks involving the use of the Squiblydoo post-exploitation
mechanism to plant the main backdoor. The information below illustrates

Assessment and implications
The TTPs used by financially motivated attackers are often not too
dissimilar from those typically observed in espionage attacks. Therefore,
organizations such as financial institutions, not thought of as typical
espionage targets, must be ready to detect, respond to, and contain
espionage threat actors’ TTPs. iDefense threat intelligence assesses
with moderate confidence that the level of activities from financially
motivated targeted attack threat groups will remain significant but lower
in volume in 2018 than in 2017.
To detect and defend against Cobalt Group’s TTPs specifically outlined
in this section, iDefense threat intelligence recommends searching
for the Registry key UserInitMprLogonScript configured with a path
pointing to a .txt script in %APPDATA% or %USERPROFILE% and blocking
access to the domains safe.my-documents[.]biz and api.toshiba[.]org.kz.

MINER MALWARE IS CREATING A
CRYPTOCURRENCY SURGE
Topline assessment:
• Cryptocurrency miner malware has been one of the largest growth
areas in malware in 2018, and its growth is likely to continue into
2019. Miner malware rewards its operators with the cryptocurrency
mined on the infected hosts of victims, who can potentially benefit
from rapid fluctuations in the price of the currency caused by
rampant speculation.
• While miner malware has traditionally mined Bitcoins—the first major
and most globally popular cryptocurrency—2017 saw a radical shift
toward and growth in malware mining alternative cryptocurrencies,
or “altcoins.”
• Monero has become by far the most popular currency used by miner
malware in 2018; Monero miner programs, such as XMRig, are freely
available on many open-code repositories and are easily incorporated
into malware by even low-capability malware developers.

Overview
Cryptocurrency miner malware has emerged in 2018 as one of the most
popular forms of malware due to its ease of use and the possibility for
a “quick win”; the return on investment for using this type of malware
is simply too high to not use it in a threat campaign. iDefense threat
intelligence analysts have observed the use of cryptocurrency miners
by both cybercrime and cyber espionage threat groups; an example
of such miners is BlackRuby, a ransomware variant that appeared in

48 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

February 2018 that would not only encrypt files like typical ransomware,
but also included a cryptominer for Monero. On the other hand, a cyber
espionage actor known as ARCHERFIST, also known in the public domain
as Iron Tiger, was observed using a Monero miner in combination with a
modified Gh0st RAT (see Figure 9).

FIGURE 9
Screenshot of Overseer RAT’s advertised Monero miner function
Typically, cryptocurrency miner malware and its network traffic are not
obfuscated and are therefore easy to detect, depending on the specific
type of miner malware creating that traffic. Both CPU and GPU miners
exist, and both increase the use of a victim system’s CPU or the GPU,
respectively. Additionally, network administrators can monitor for network
traffic on unusual ports as well as traffic to miner pools.
A significant reason for the growth in miner malware in 2017 and into
2018 is the profitability of mining alternative cryptocurrencies. Monero
has a far lower “difficulty rate” for mining than Bitcoins, mining for which
is unprofitable without the use of application-specific integrated circuit

49 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

chips (ASICs), which is dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware frequently
used on an industrial scale by Bitcoin miners. Monero has since
risen to become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies used by
miner malware. iDefense threat intelligence analysis of cyber criminal
underground activity has indicated a plethora of advertisements by
malware authors and resellers for Monero miner malware during 2017
and going into 2018. The variety of malware available ranges from
generic and cheap entry-level malware to vast botnets of compromised
devices infected with custom malware.
Monero has also been linked to threat activities associated with the
NEEDLEFISH group, also known as the Lazarus group, a cluster of
advanced espionage and financially motivated threat actors likely
affiliated with the North Korean state. Operators of Bitcoin wallets
previously collected ransom payments for the ransomware WannaCry,
which multiple security vendors have publicly attributed to NEEDLEFISH,
which the United States government has attributed to the North Korean
state, and which may have used Monero to launder funds after emptying
victims’ wallets, according to cryptocurrency transaction analysis
vendor Chainalysis.42 On several occasions, campaigns associated
with NEEDLEFISH have reportedly conducted Monero mining on
infrastructure of targeted organizations as part of a wider campaign.
It is likely that Monero offers strong benefits for states interested
in circumventing economic sanctions, especially financial system
sanctions, as well as for states subject to a high level of surveillance
of their international trade practices.

GDPR: How GDPR could influence cyber criminal extortion
and data-for-ransom attacks
Topline assessment:
• GDPR continues to have a potential impact on the risk calculations
of organizations holding EU subjects’ data. Several organizations
have issued breach notifications following the introduction of
GDPR legislation on May 25, 2018, indicating that the risk of data
theft and manipulation from external actors still remains, despite
the increased regulatory burden.
• iDefense threat intelligence analysts assess it is likely that cyber
criminals will attempt to leverage the threat of GDPR noncompliance in attempts to extort organizations, especially in the
immediate aftermath of GDPR coming into force. iDefense threat
intelligence analysts have already identified actors discussing
how to leverage GDPR as a social engineering lure when
communicating with target organizations.
• Distorted incentives to disclose breaches may result in more-frequent
abuse and misuse of “bug bounty” vulnerability disclosure platforms
to keep breaches out of the view of the public and regulators.

Overview
GDPR came into force on May 25, 2018, and is considered to be
one of the most important changes in data privacy regulation in the
past 20 years. The regulation imposes fines of up to 20 million euros
(approximately US$24 million), or 4 percent of global annual turnover, on
companies who fail to comply with GDPR. GDPR is designed to protect
the data of all EU subjects, regardless of the country in which they reside
51 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

or the platform on which their data resides. As a result, a company
located and domiciled in the United States that handles the data of EU
subjects could be the subject of fines levied by EU member states if that
company’s data is found to have been misused or mishandled. As a result
of GDPR, users must also be notified within 72 hours if their data has
been exposed in a breach or be subject to a fine of up to 10 million euros
(approximately US$12 million), or 2 percent of global annual turnover.
In the past six months, in the lead up to the deadline for GDPR
compliance, iDefense threat intelligence analysts identified an increase
in criminal chatter regarding GDPR and news coverage of the issue.
The high level of attention of those in the technology community and
vertical surrounding the GDPR “cliff edge” of May 25 has also filtered
through to the cyber criminal community. Cyber criminals tend to pay a
great deal of attention to industry news, with actors frequently sharing
news updates and media stories on underground criminal forums and
marketplaces. Paying attention to developments in the markets heavily
informs actors’ TTPs and their targeting of specific verticals.
Cyber extortion using stolen or modified private data, also known
as “data-for-ransom,” is one of the most prevalent attack techniques
that financially motivated cyber criminals use in targeted attacks.
Threat actors, by gaining access to internal networks or vulnerable
Web-facing infrastructure, siphon off data and threaten to release the
data publicly or sell it on the criminal underground unless the victim
organization pays a ransom fee to the criminals. Actors frequently
spend time reconnoitering an organization to identify the data of most
value or sensitivity to the organization, such as customer payment data,
intellectual property, or private e-mail messages. Access to this data is
then used to blackmail victims by threatening to publicly disclose it or
modify it beyond recovery.

FIGURE 10
Cyber extortion Twitter discussion
Whether GDPR will be leveraged by data-for-ransom actors has been the
subject of significant discussion within the information security industry.
Given the potential threat of punitive financial sanctions, far more than
those previously leveraged by a European data protection authority, as
well as the EU claiming global jurisdiction of its subjects, threat actors
could extract additional leverage against their victims by threatening
to report GDPR non-compliance to national data protection authorities.
While organizations are still required to issue notifications within 72 hours
if they discover a breach, there is still a potential risk that companies will
avoid issuing notifications to avoid reputational damage resulting from
a breach. As a result, companies may prefer to risk making an extortion
payment far smaller than the potential fine to a cyber criminal actor rather
than provide a notification that would result in enforcement action.
iDefense threat intelligence analysts assess it highly likely that cyber
criminal actors will leverage GDPR when attempting to employ social
engineering attacks against an organization’s employees. iDefense
threat intelligence analysts have already identified actors on a criminal
53 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

Tor-based marketplace discussing using GDPR as a social engineering
lure to cover up the theft of a publicly exposed customer database by
reporting the vulnerability to the company’s IT department:
“Your play would be that the company is not compliant with GDPR and that
you just wanted to give the IT guy in charge a friendly heads up by pointing
out that their database is accessible through a misconfiguration.”
This tactic is also likely to also manifest itself in targeted spear-phishing
e-mail lures and telephone social engineering attacks through which
the mention of GDPR non-compliance could be used to trigger action
by a targeted IT department that the attacker could exploit. The United
Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) reported that in
May 2018 it identified actors utilizing GDPR notifications as e-mail
phishing lures to target Apple Inc. customers with credential theft.43
iDefense threat intelligence analysts will continue to monitor for
malicious e-mail traffic utilizing GDPR as a lure in 2018 and beyond.
Low-skilled threat actors, who routinely target Web-facing infrastructure
with automated mass Web application attacks, such as cross-site
scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi) attacks, could also use GDPR
as leverage to demand payments by describing them as legitimate
vulnerability disclosures. For example, a threat actor could identify
an externally accessible database containing sensitive customer
information vulnerable to SQLi attacks. The actor could then demand
a “bug bounty” payment for the disclosure and to keep the information
private; without payment, the actor could threaten to refer the
vulnerability and any exfiltrated data to the national regulator. iDefense
threat intelligence analysts assess that the potential for the bug bounty
process to be manipulated in a GPDR environment may be significant
if organizations attempt to classify ransom payments as legitimate
bounties to avoid dealing with disclosure and GDPR legislation.

Developments in the ransomware threat
Topline assessment:
• Ransomware continues to be the most prevalent attack vector for
extortion operations, with attacks against organizations doubling
from 2016 to 2017, rising from 13 percent to 27 percent of all reported
incidents targeting corporations.44
• High-profile ransomware attacks, such as WannaCry and BadRabbit,
have resulted in increased public awareness of the threat, with end
users becoming more conscious of operating with improved security
measures, including backing up data and not opening unknown
attachments.
• Cyber criminals are innovating their attack methods and diversifying
toward the use of multi-functional ransom malware that encompasses
secondary functionality such as miner malware or data exfiltration to
ensure a second layer of possible profitability.
• iDefense threat intelligence analysts predict that targeted attack
groups will continue to use ransomware, with threat actors
repurposing malware advertised on the criminal underground to
deflect attribution efforts away from APT groups’ use of the malware
for destructive purposes.

Overview
Ransomware continues to target organizations as part of both opportunistic
and targeted attacks, with threat actors taking advantage of anonymous
cryptocurrencies, underground networks of skilled criminal labor, and

55 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

increased dependence on access to data and technology. Through
ransomware, attackers can target data that is intrinsically valuable
to victims, eradicating the need to seek out a buyer for data on the
underground. Attackers are willing to exploit human and technical
vulnerabilities and are not afraid to go after so-called softer targets,
such as those in the healthcare vertical, in which data and service
availability is paramount. iDefense threat intelligence analysts assess
that ransom malware continues to be an affordable and lucrative option
for threat actors, and its crypto-ransomware and locker-ransomware
variants will likely remain popular attack types for financially motivated
criminals during the remainder of 2018.
With public awareness of the ransomware threat being significantly
heightened following the WanaCrypt0r and NotPetya campaigns of
2017, end users and organizations are likely to have become more
knowledgeable and resilient to the ransomware threat. This resilience
may result in a natural shift toward cyber criminals exploring alternative,
novice attack techniques. Developers continue to work to maintain the
effectiveness of their malware by generating new, undetectable strands
of crypto-ransomware or blockers. There remains a strong financial
incentive associated with extortion, and developers are likely to continue
to seek out improved attack methods, looking to diversify away from
the typical Windows-variant CryptoLocker malware that has been
highly prolific and a consistent threat in recent years.
With end users and corporations moving toward practices including
more regular backups of data, malware developers may seek to
add additional functionality to that which was previously standard
ransomware. With such malware, criminals may add in dual- or trifunctionality to ensure a profitable return on investment. iDefense

56 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

threat iIntelligence research indicates that attackers are already adding
data exfiltration functionality to ransomware. During August 2017,
a Cerber variant was identified with added infostealer features that
target passwords stored in browsers and files related to Bitcoin wallet
applications. While this example limits attackers’ abilities to target data
that could contain direct additional financial value, such as banking
passwords and cryptocurrency wallets, attackers may target other
applications or security systems to access databases, servers, or client
applications from victim computers.45
Another functionality that criminals are exploring for ransom malware is
the inclusion of cryptominer malware, as noted previously in this report
with the mention of the BlackRuby ransomware variant.46 The inclusion
of coin miner malware, which has become increasingly prevalent in the
wild and is being advertised widely on criminal underground forums,
may act as an insurance policy for threat actors to ensure that their
victim infections are not without profit should the target opt not to meet
ransom demands. Separately, a tactic that emerged in 2017 was the
use of ransomware by targeted attack and APT groups to camouflage
destructive malicious attack activity. This appears to have been the case
with the NotPetya attacks launched in June 2017, in which ransomware
that initially appeared to be based on a financially motivated variant
sold on the criminal underground, Petya, was reused to carry out
destructive, politically motivated attacks. This use of ransomware as
a smokescreen—whereby attackers deliver ransomware to distract
investigators and deflect attention away from the primary purpose of
the attack against the victim—has been seen in the past.

57 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

What’s happening?

In addition to using ransomware as a smokescreen, it can effectively
be deployed to destroy data, with malware appearing to take the form
of ransomware infecting targeted individuals or organizations to wipe
data. An example of this can be seen in the MBR-ONI campaign that
was identified in November 2017. The attacks targeted several Japanese
organizations with what initially appeared to be ransomware deployed
on hundreds of computers. The “ransomware” provides a ransom note
promising the prospect of recovered data if an extortion demand is met;
however, researchers assess that MBR-ONI was not actually designed
to have a decryption key provided and instead acted to hide evidence
of a targeted infiltration and data exfiltration campaign that had been
ongoing for up to nine months prior to the identified attack.47

58 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

PROACTIVE DEFENSE
Organizations should not feel they can only activate their incident
response plans in the event of a breach. Today, the best approach is
to adopt a continuous response model—always assume you have been
breached—and use your incident response and threat hunting teams
to look for the next breach.
In summary:
1.	
Cyber threats and adversaries located in Iran continue to be a
growing force to be reckoned with. iDefense threat intelligence
research indicates that these threat actors and threat groups will
continue to grow their malicious activities and capabilities. These
threat actors will likely target other Middle Eastern nations with
Android malware and repurposed ransomware.
2.	Increasingly, adversaries are utilizing third- or fourth-party supply
chain partners to penetrate target networks. These adversaries will
continue to grow their use of weaponized software updates, prepackaged devices, and supplier ecosystems to take advantage of
the fact that these are out of target companies’ control.
3.	The oil and natural gas industry continues to be an attractive
target for adversaries because of the convergence of IT and OT.
IIoT devices are introducing attack vectors and vulnerabilities into
a technology stack that is largely unprepared for malicious cyber
threat activities.

59 > CYBER THREATSCAPE REPORT 2018

Proactive Defense

4.	Financially motivated cyber criminals are expanding their capabilities
to include traditional cyber espionage TTPs. Adversaries are poised to
explore new malicious tools to attain financial rewards and a profitable
return on investment for attacks.
5.	Cyber criminals are shifting their cryptocurrency mining malware
from Bitcoins to other cryptocurrencies. They are also expanding
their extortion-based attacks using ransomware and uncovering
GDPR violations for the purpose of extortion.
By better analyzing data, organizations can start to anticipate risks
and adopt a more proactive approach to defensive strategies through
actionable threat intelligence.
