We came across this news and this tweet which spoke about how money lending apps (loan
apps) on Google Play Store abuse and threaten the user, demanding exorbitant amounts of money.
These money lending apps collect money with high interest rates and then threaten the user if there
is any delay in repaying the dues and in some cases, even after clearing the dues the loan agent
demands more money. If the user does not repay the demanded money, abusive messages/images
of the user will be sent to all the contacts in the user’s device. There are many reports of users taking
their own life as they were unable to withstand the harassment. And the more saddening part is that
some of these apps are still available in Google Play Store.
Some of the loan apps in Google Play Store are shown in Figure 1.

Technical Analysis
In this blog, we will be analysing the com.lvcash.lvcashcomshoz app in Google Play Store.
This loan app is named “Cash Advance” in Google Play Store.
When the user installs this app as shown in Figure 3, the app requests for a list of permissions as
shown in Figure 4. Why does a loan app request these permissions? Whenever any app is installed,
users should be alert as to what permissions are sought by the app and decide which permissions
are actually necessary for the app to function properly.

This app accesses the camera on the user’s device as shown in Figure 5 and captures images and
records videos of the user as shown in Figure 6, which can later be used to threaten them.

The app collects the contact lists from the user’s device as shown in Figure 7. Later, the loan agent
threatens the user by sending abusive messages/images to this collected contact list.

The app also collects a list of installed packages from the user’s device as shown in Figure 8.

The app collects the location, SMS details and device information from the user’s device as shown in
Figure 9 and Figure 10.

Considering the aforementioned modules of the app, viz contact list collection, camera control, etc;
we can understand that this app is designed with deception and strong-arm tactics in mind. Once the
user makes a financial commitment through this app, they are trapped and their own user data is
used against them. During the installation, the app does mention in its privacy policy that it collects
all SMS details, contact list, access camera, storage, installed applications, IP of the device and also
says that it will upload this information to their site https[:]//app[.lvcash[.xyz.
