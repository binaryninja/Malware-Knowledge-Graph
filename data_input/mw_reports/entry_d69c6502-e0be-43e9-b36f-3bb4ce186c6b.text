At the start of the year, Bitdefender noticed a RIG Exploit Kit campaign using CVE-202126411 exploits found in Internet Explorer to deliver RedLine Stealer, a low-cost password
stealer sold on underground forums.
When executed, RedLine Stealer performs recon against the target system (including
username, hardware, browsers installed, anti-virus software) and then exfiltrates data
(including passwords, saved credit cards, crypto wallets, VPN logins) to a remote command
and control server.

Key Findings
Bitdefender discovered a new RIG Exploit Kit campaign targeting an Internet Explorer
vulnerability designed to distribute RedLine Stealer malware.
If executed, the stealer exfiltrates passwords, cookies and credit card data saved in
browsers, as well as crypto wallets, chat logs, VPN login credentials and text from
files as per the instructions received from the C2 infrastructure.

Mitigation
Ensure anti-virus and EDR solutions have exploit detection capabilities.
Look for the indicators of compromise (IOCs) and keep operating systems and thirdparty applications up to date, and prioritize security fixes.
