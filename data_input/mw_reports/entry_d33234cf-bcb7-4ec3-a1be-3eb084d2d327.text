Introduction

A distributed denial-of-service attack (or DDoS attack) is a malicious attempt using multiple
systems to make computer or network resources unavailable to its intended users, usually by
interrupting or suspending services connected to the Internet.[1]
The evolution of DDoS attack techniques and targets has been continuously followed in the
past by the specialists ranging from powerful companies, which manage an important part of
the global Internet bandwidth and content delivery networks, to security expert blogs. However,
recently it has caught general attention due to several incidents that might mean a change of
paradigm in the way such attacks have been addressed so far, mainly for two reasons presented
below.
First, from a technical perspective, it is remarkable that the bandwidth of some of the latest
attacks skyrockets in comparison to what has been seen previously. On October 21, 2016, a
series of DDoS attacks against Dyn DNS (a DNS provider used by many important Internet
companies) impacted the availability of a number of sites concentrated in the north-east of the
United States and, later on, other areas of the USA. Impacted sites included among others:
PayPal, Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and RuneScape. Also, earlier that
month, the attacks against the Krebs on Security blog and the French Internet service and hosting
provider OVH reached 620 Gbps and 1.2 Tbps respectively [2].
The attack against the Krebs on Security blog trying to silence it – this blog has been very active
explaining the techniques and motivation of the DDoS threat actors [3] – is especially revealing
about this change of scale. The blog, which had been targeted by DDoS attacks previously,
was protected by the Akamai DDoS mitigation service. Akami was providing protection for free
due to the public relevance of this blog in the community. However following the attacks in
October 2016, Akami was forced to cancel the service due to the huge resources needed for the
mitigation:
Akamai had protected krebsonsecurity.com for four years, but the magnitude of the attacks seen
during the final week were significantly larger than the majority of attacks Akamai sees on a regular
basis. [4]
Botnets exploiting vulnerabilities in hundred of thousands of Internet connected devices, such
as cameras, DVRs, and home DSL routers were behind an important part of these massive
attacks. The fact that security was not one of the design targets for these devices was long
considered a potential threat by the security community, which was often neglected by the
manufacturers. These potential threats have turned into serious incidents with many devices
affected. On November 26, 2016, Deutsche Telekom announced an outage affecting over 900
000 customers. The affected customers all had routers that were vulnerable to a specific exploit
that was incorporated into an Internet of Things (IoT) worm that was released on the Internet.
The aim of this worm was to add these devices under the control of one of the botnet masters.
During that week, there was a peak of traffic related to that vulnerability – most prominently in
Brazil and the UK [5, 6].
The second factor to be underlined is the fact that in August 2016 the code of one of the IoT
botnets was publicly released on Internet, which makes it much more easy for different threat
actors to achieve such attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the IoT devices. It is difficult to
assess at the moment, how this potentially easy proliferation of such botnets will affect the
number and power of the attacks in the future.
Strategies to mitigate DDoS need to be adopted. These should focus initially on prevention,
but eventually by designing multi-layered defense strategies. Therefore, DDoS threats should

1

be taken into account as part of Business Continuity Planning, along with issues such as site
selection, power outages, and natural disasters.
In this document, CERT-EU has focused on procedures for securing IT infrastructure from threats
against availability. The white-paper is based on proven DDoS identification and mitigation
methods that can effectively and efficiently respond to DDoS attacks.

1.1

Target Audience

This document is aimed at general IT staff that has undertaken the responsibility of being prepared to respond to DDoS incident. This document only provides high-level guidelines. Different approaches are possible and may be valid. This document should rather be seen as a
guideline in case of the absence of more specific local policies and procedures related to this
topic. It does not supersede any specific applicable policies or procedures, which should be
followed if they exist.
In case of doubts or any additional questions about this document, do not hesitate to seek
further advice and assistance from your respective authorities or CERT-EU team.

DDoS Attack Categories

There are three primary categories of DDoS attacks [1]:
Volumetric Attacks: These include UDP, ICMP, and other (spoofed or not) packet floods. The
attack aims to saturate the bandwidth of the targeted resource. Magnitude is measured in bits
per second. In this category it is important to underline the amplification attacks – attacks that
take advantages of the asymmetry design of some protocols (such as DNS and NTP) to flood the
victim with the answers to queries, which multiply many times the number of bits of the query.
Protocol Attacks: These include SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, Smurf, and more. This
type of attack consumes actual server resources or resources on the intermediate equipment,
such as firewalls and load balancers. Magnitude is measured in packets per second.
Application Layer Attacks: These include slow POST, HashDos, GET flood, clogging and more.
This attack sends data according to specific features of well-known applications such as HTTP,
DNS, SMTP, SSL. Comprised of seemingly legitimate packets, the goal of these attacks is the
depletion of certain resources in the application. Magnitude is measured in requests per second.
The different layers potentially used by the DDoS attacks are presented in Figure 1.

DDoS Threat Landscape

Getting global information concerning the evolution of the DDoS attacks is not an easy task,
because the information is spread between the ISPs and the targets of the attacks all around the
Internet. For writing this white-paper, CERT-EU has reviewed the latest reports from two of the
leading companies offering defense services against DDoS. These reports are based on the data
recorded by these defense networks and in one of them also on information from a periodic
technical survey sent to its clients [7, 4]. The aim of this white-paper is not to reproduce nor
summarize these reports, but to offer some of the conclusions with analysis, but underlining the
original sources.

2

Figure 1: The layering of DDoS attacks on the OSI network model
According to [7], 34% of the enterprise, government, and education organizations reported
that they have experienced DDoS attacks in 2015. Among those, over one-quarter indicated
that they suffered more than 10 attacks per month, and about half say the attacks exceeded
their total Internet capacity. The motivation that these organizations attribute to these attacks
is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: DDoS attack motivations
This data gives a predominant role in the DDoS attacks to criminal organizations in contrast
to the information offered in the previous version of this white-paper, related to the year 2013
[8]. Although the source is also different, such attribution can be supported by the evidence
that stresser tools/bots have been used much more often recently, in contrast with other typical
hacktivism tools (such as the famous LOIC) used previously.
3

Regarding the attack size, in general the peak attack sizes and large attack frequency seem to
have increased dramatically over the last years [7]. A graph of the tendency of the size of the
DDoS attacks over the last several years is presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Size of DDoS attacks in the rent years
The latest data available for the third quarter of 2016 shows – versus the same quarter of 2015
– a 77% increase of the DDoS and a 138% increase of those bigger than 100Gps [7]. This trend
is consistent with the recent attacks against the Krebs on Security blog and the French Internet
service and hosting provider OVH reached 620 Gbps and 1.2 Tbps respectively. It confirms the
trend of significant growth in the top-end size of DDoS attacks year-over-year.
UDP fragments and DNS reflection continued to be the largest portion of the DDoS. The two
vectors are strongly correlated, because a considerable amount of the UDP fragmentation traffic
is caused by DNS traffic. Combined UDP fragmentation and DNS floods grew by 4.5% in the
third quarter of 2016, accounting for nearly 44% of the attack vectors reported by [7].
The evolution of the NTP protocol attacks presented in the quoted report is of special interest,
because it seems that while the number of NTP attacks has grown over time, the amount of
traffic generated by each attack has decreased significantly. This is because the number of
vulnerable servers has stabilized, after decreasing significantly due to the patching. Also there
started to appear a competition between the attackers for the remaining resources, since this
attack has improved its popularity during the last two years. During 2014, when the NTP
vulnerability was published, CERT-EU started a scanning campaign reporting to the constituency
with a good rate of fixing the vulnerable servers. The same was done after that for DNS open
resolvers and to prevent amplification attacks using the SNMP protocol.
On the other hand, stressers and botnets account for a large portion of the attack traffic in the
largest attacks. Usually different techniques are used in these largest attacks. Among them,
Mirai botnet has had an prominent role in the last few months. Rather than using reflectors,
Mirai uses compromised IoT systems and generates traffic directly from those nodes. Mirai scans
the Internet for telnet services using well-known weak passwords present in many devices. The
code itself is downloaded during a telnet session using FTP. Mirai also terminates processes that
belong to competing botnets and closes its own attack vector.
Mirai can be highly tailored. The first version was capable of ten different attacks. Half of its
success is the use of the GRE protocol1 as application layer attack. It is also resilient with respect

network by encapsulating its datagrams over IP packets

to the availability of its C2 servers, and it has a great capacity of generating peak traffic without
using reflectors/amplification, because it has available a big number of vulnerable IoT devices
[4].
Due to the public release of the source code and ita extensible nature, new versions of the code
have been detected. In addition, according to statistics about the use of telnet service, they have
skyrocketed in the last four months. It is than quite possible that we might see in the future
attacks of several Tbps which might be the peak power of all the potential Mirai controlled
devices on the Internet.
However, it is not easy to assess if (and if so - when) this potential threat will materialize. The
attention received by Mirai after its release in the public domain might contribute to acceleration of the process described above related to the life cycle of the NTP amplifications attacks.
It may lead to many attackers competing for controlling the same resources. Although in this
case, the size of the potentially available resources to set up the attack is much bigger than in
the case of NTP amplification attacks.

DDoS Mitigation

As mentioned, DDoS is one of the risks to be addressed in the organization Business Continuity
Plan (BCP). The organization should start by assessing the likelihood of different scenarios and
the business impact for the organization. Only after understanding the consequences of a DDoS
and its likelihood, the accountable managers for the affected service can start and support the
needed actions and plans to reduce the risk to a level they can accept.
Some of the aspects that have to be taken into account are common for risk assessment supporting BCP. Following suggested points should be reviewed specifically for DDoS mitigation in
this analysis:
• On what IT assets the services depend on, and what are the relationships/dependencies
between them. Ideally, it would be useful to have a dependency tree describing the connections between assets and services. For instance: knowing what databases are supporting what services, or what services might be affected, if it is decided to reduce the TTL
in the DNS. Such information can be very useful in order to foresee the consequences of
some mitigation techniques.
• What are the external nodes in the dependency trees and which underpinning contracts
assurance their availability. What are the contact points related to these resources to be
reported to in case of a DDoS.
• What are the different scenarios that might be applicable concerning these dependency
trees; which are the single points of failure; which assets are critical to support more than
one service or the most critical service.
• What threats can by identified that can cause a fail in the dependency tree. Gathering
further technical information about the assets and dependencies might help to foresee the
type of DDoS that the organization is most vulnerable to. For example, it does not make
sense to publish through a Content Delivery Network of resources with high dependency
on dynamic content. Reviewing a DDoS attack which might target the assets that generate this dynamic content (such as the databases) might be more useful. In this phase,
some controlled stress-tests might be helpful to point to the weakest link in the chain of
dependencies.

5

Having all that information, one can start to select the mitigation techniques and controls to be
implemented in the mitigation plan and its continuous improvement strategy.
In any case, CERT-EU recommends a formal approach to the risk assessment for those constituents which have been already attacked, as well as for those who have a high risk as result
of a preliminary estimation. In order to achieve it, CERT-EU recommends to use the same risk
assessment methodology that are used for the rest of IT security risk mitigation, but focus on
the availability of the information, instead of on confidentiality or integrity.
Defending a site against a DDoS attack has both a fixed and a variable cost. The fixed costs
come in the form of locations, servers, and engineering. The variable, or operational, costs
include the bandwidth served and manpower needed to mitigate attacks for the time they are
on-going [4]. From this perspective, mitigating DDoS is a business decision that should address
what service should be still available under what kind of a DDoS attack and for how long. It is
also important to support the proper mitigation plan with the proper budget allocations and to
accept the residual risk. It is important to remember that starting by considering only or mainly
technical aspects might be misleading.

4.1

Mitigation Techniques

It is important to underline that taking into account the strength of the latest attacks, it may be
necessary to hire specialist services, if continuous availability under a powerful DDoS attack is
the requirement of an organization. There have been several guides from different specialists
published that show possible approaches to facing such attacks [9, 10]
Similarly to the list of types of attacks, the list of mitigation techniques does not try to be
exhaustive. It only offers a summary that can be extended by specialized literature. Eventually,
the techniques chosen should be tailored to reach the proper residual risk that the management
can or has to accept.
• Blocking the attack via FW/IPS. It can be useful with Layer 7 DDoS attacks when they
can be detected by signatures or when the source IPs make it feasible. On the other
hand, these devices can be themselves targeted by network DDoS attacks, they are useless
against reflective attacks, and in oder to work properly against DDoS attacks they might
need additional personnel training or specialist in the team.
• Auto-scale resources. Although theoretically possible in the cloud, might not be possible
for the back-end. In addition, it might not be setup fast enough to mitigate the attack.
• Adding mitigation DDoS hardware. It may be very useful to detect application-layer attacks early, which is very important to avoid that the services get affected. On the other
hand, it might require to setup a specialist team in-house or will add an important overhead to the network administrators.
• Publishing service through a Content Delivery Network. It can be useful to absorb
volumetric attack for static content, but without other techniques might not address
application-layer attacks.
• Hiring DDoS scrubbing services. Theoretically they are able to just send to the organization the clean traffic after absorbing the attack, because they are supposed to have the
intelligence to detect and discard most of the DDoS attack types. However, they might
need to be complemented with DNS and BGP solutions in order to be effective. In addition, considering the attack’s peak bandwidth seen lately, it might be really expensive for
the size of the resources required to mitigate such attack.

4.2

DDoS Mitigation Plan

An effective immediate response is difficult and may depend on third parties, such as ISPs and
DDoS mitigation specialists. These external partners have large scale infrastructures and use a
variety of technologies for identification, containment, and remediation. Therefore, DDoS attacks can sometimes be identified and mitigated before they reach the organization’s premises.
Additional tasks, especially in case of attacks on the network-layer, such as bandwidth prioritization and sinkholing may be performed at end-user/organization level.
The following list summarizes the proposed DDoS mitigation guide:
1. Preparation
• contacts and procedures
• ISP and specialized support
• network & infrastructure setups
2. Identification
• detection and alerting
• attack analysis
• motivation identification
• mitigation acquirement/refinement
• traceback
3. Containment
• network modifications
• content delivery control
• traffic control
4. Remediation
• bandwidth prioritization and blocking
• traffic-scrubbing
• sinkholing
5. Recovery
• normal state verification
• rollback
6. Aftermath
• incident review and information disclosure
• law enforcement

Proposed Course of Action per Mitigation Stage
Preparation

Contacts and procedures:
• Maintain contact information for team members and others within and outside the organization such as ISP, CDN services, response teams, and law enforcement authorities.
• Establish communication mechanisms. For data communications make sure that nonsaturated lines will be used.
• Update the Recovery and Continuity Plan on new DDoS developments. Define a clear
response escalation path.
• Ensure that the capacity of the entire infrastructure is not restricted by a single or limited
number of resources.
• Dedicate Hardware and Software for DDoS mitigation (workstations, servers, network
monitoring and analysis tools).
7

• Establish alternative service and Internet gateways.
ISP and specialized support:
• Update on ISP’s mitigation services.
• Establish DDoS protection contracts and SLAs. Secure immediate activation of agreed
services.
• Obtain a clear overview on infrastructure’s performance in order to identify deviations
derived from an attack.
• Establish specialized support from DDoS mitigation experts.
Network & infrastructure setups:
• Create ACLs for traffic prioritization.
• Set up alternative communication on critical services using VPN.
• Use Reverse path forwarding (RPF).
• Apply inbound and outbound traffic filtering.
• Introduce weak authentication phase prior to the actual on authentication protocols.
• Apply limits for:
– ICMP packet rate,
– SYN packet rate,
– DNS TTL for the exposed systems,
• Secure network, operating systems, servers, applications and components.

4.3.2

Identification

Detection and alerting:
• Search for traffic patterns to expose known attacks (signature detection).
• Compare parameters of the observed network traffic with normal traffic (anomaly detection).
• Contact CERT-EU for early warnings and indicator notices.
Attack analysis:
• Identify the abused systems and services.
• Understand if you are the target of the attack or a collateral victim.
• Get a list of attacking IPs by tracing them onto the log files.
• Define the attack’s profile by using network monitoring and traffic analysis tools.
Motivation identification:
• Make a list of potential DDoS attack initiators.
• Investigate possible motives.
Mitigation acquirement/refinement:
• Contact ISP to report the attack.
• Ask for assessment and visibility into the attack.
• Enable remediation measures.
• Notify executives and law enforcement services.
Traceback:
• If possible identify the inbound points (by ACLs, NetFlow or backscatter mechanisms).

8

4.3.3

Containment

Network modifications:
• Switch to alternative sites or networks using DNS or other mechanism.
• Distribute attack traffic across network of data centers.
• Route traffic on scrubbing services and products.
Content delivery control:
• Use caching/proxing.
• Enable alternative communication channels (VPN).
Traffic control:
• Terminate unwanted connections or processes on servers and routers.
• Configure outbound filters for reducing DDoS response footprint.
• Control content delivery based on user and session details.

4.3.4

Remediation

Bandwidth prioritization and blocking:
• Deny connections using geographic information.
• Deny connections based on IP and traffic signatures.
• Place limits on the amount of traffic, maximum burst size, traffic priority on individual
packet types.
Traffic scrubbing:
• Use dedicated devices and modules with high-performing hardware that can support focused scrubbing algorithms.
Sinkholing:
• Attract DDoS traffic on the IP blocks advertised by the sinkhole to apply specialized analysis.

4.3.5

Recovery

Normal state verification:
• Verify that traffic is nominal with no sharp increases. Let a period of time since last
violation before the traffic flow is considered normal.
• Ensure that the impacted services can be operational again.
• Ensure that your infrastructure performance is back to your baseline.
• Ensure that there are no collateral damages.
Rollback:
• Initiate suspended services, applications and modules.
• Rollback the mitigation measures.
• Announce the end of the incident.
• Revert to your original network.

9

4.3.6

Aftermath

Incident review and information Disclosure:
• Evaluate the effectiveness of response.
• Review the measures that could be taken to better address the incident response.
• Review and refine attack-handling tools and procedures taken during the incident.
• Create an incident review.
• Measure the operational impact and costs.
Law enforcement:
• Ensure the attack evidences are valid for forensic analysis.
• Collaborate with law enforcement services.

Conclusion

Until recently, DDoS attacks targeting on-line public services might have appeared to be mostly
linked to hacktivism. Nowadays, it is not possible to find any important political movement or
campaign without Internet presence. Hacktivism is simply a way protests and demonstrations
have moved to Internet. Hence, it is likely that hacktivism (and the DDoS threat it is associated
with) will play even more important role also in the future.
However, recent data gives a predominant role in the DDoS attacks to criminal organizations.
With the increased use of stresser tools and botnets, much larger volumetric attacks are now
possible. These new tools can be easily used for criminal purposes and for financial gain, but
also possibly to achieve political means of certain groups, parties, or even nation-states.
These possibilities have to be kept in mind when evaluating and deciding on how to prepare
against the potential DDoS attacks.
Consequently, the main ideas that CERT-EU would offer for consideration in order to face such
issues, are:
• Institutions should establish their availability requirements clearly. It might have different
implications for critical services that must be available (even with legal implications),
such as publications in the Official Dairy or on-line call-for-tenders than for resources that
might support and explain public policies or political decisions.
• It is very important to know in advance the weakest links and bottlenecks that might
threaten this availability requirements in case of a DDoS attack. In order to do that, a
comprehensive risk assessment is highly recommended.
• Taking into account the latest attack strength, it might be required to hire specialist help or
consultancy services to address demanding availability requirements. CERT-EU can help
the constituency to analyze the proposals they might have from a vendor-neutral point of
view.
Finally, in case of a DDoS attack, reporting the incident and investigating various aspects, such
as the threat actors involved or the techniques used, can help for the global security on Internet.
