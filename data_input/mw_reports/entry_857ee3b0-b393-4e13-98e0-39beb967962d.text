üßê About

The CISA Hunt and Incident Response Program (CHIRP) is a tool created to dynamically
query Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) on hosts with a single package, outputting data in a
JSON format for further analysis in a SIEM or other tool. CHIRP does not modify any system
data.

üèÅ Getting Started

We build and release CHIRP via Releases. However, if you wish to run with Python3.6+,
follow these instructions.
You can also write new indicators or plugins for CHIRP.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or greater is required to run CHIRP with Python. If you need help installing
Python in your environment, follow the instructions here
CHIRP must be run on a live machine, but it does not have to be network connected.

Installing
python3 -m pip install -e .

In our experience, yara-python comes with some other dependencies. You MAY have
to install Visual Studio C++ 14.0 and the Windows 10 SDK, this can be retrieved with
Visual Studio Community

# defaults
.\chirp.exe -a AA21-008A
# with args
.\chirp.exe -a AA21-062A -p registry yara -t c:\\target_dir\\** -o chirp_result -non-interactive -vv

From python
# defaults
python3 chirp.py -a AA21-008A
# with args
python3 chirp.py -a AA21-062A -p registry yara -t c:\\target_dir\\** -o chirp_result
--non-interactive -vv

Example output
[15:32:19] [YARA] Enumerating the entire filesystem due to ['CISA Solar Fire', 'CISA
Teardrop', 'CrowdStrike Rempack', 'CrowdStrike Sunspot', 'FireEye
common.py:103
Cosmic Gale', 'FireEye Sunburst']... this is going to take a while.
[YARA] Entered yara plugin.
common.py:103
[REGISTRY] Found 0 hit(s) for IFEO Persistence indicator.

[REGISTRY] Found 0 hit(s) for Teardrop - Registry Activity indicator.

[+] Done! Your results can be found at Z:\README\output.

Non-interactive Mode
Non-interactive mode may be used by issuing the "--non-interactive" flag at runtime. Using
this flag enables process completion without input. In addition, a non-zero status of 1 will be
emitted at runtime completion if IoC's were discovered.

‚õè Built Using

Python - Language
Nuitka - For compilation
evtx2json - For event log access
yara-python - Parses and runs yara rules
rich - Makes the CLI easier on the eyes
psutil - Provides an easy API for many OS functions
aiomp - Asynchronous multiprocessing
pyyaml - Allows YAML interpretation
