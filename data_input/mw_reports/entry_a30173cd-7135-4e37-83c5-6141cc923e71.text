Nozomi Networks Researchers Track Malicious Glupteba
Activity Through the Blockchain

December 15, 2022

Threat actors are increasingly leveraging blockchain technology to launch cyberattacks. By
taking advantage of the distributed and decentralized nature of blockchain, malicious actors can
exploit its anonymity for a variety of attacks, ranging from malware propagation to ransomware
distribution.
The Glupteba trojan is an example of a threat actor leveraging blockchain-based technologies to
carry out their malicious activity. In this blog, Nozomi Networks Lab presents our latest findings
on Glupteba and how security teams can search for malicious activity in the blockchain.

Nozomi Networks Researchers have tracked Glupteba through the blockchain, identifying 15
Glupteba bitcoin addresses spawning over four years, through four different campaigns.

What is Glupteba?
Glupteba is a backdoor trojan that is downloaded via Pay-Per-Install networks – online ad
campaigns that prompt software or application downloads – in infected installers or software
cracks. Once Glupteba is active on a system, the botnet operators can deploy additional
modules from the credential stealer to exploit kits compromising devices on the target network.
There are several Glupteba modules aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in various Internet of
Things (IoT) appliances from vendors, such as MikroTik and Netgear.

Surprisingly, Glupteba leverages the Bitcoin blockchain to distribute its Command and Control
(C2) domains to infected systems. Apart from the fact that this is an uncommon technique, this
mechanism is also extremely resilient to takedowns as there is no way to erase nor censor a
validated Bitcoin transaction. Using the same approach that Glupteba is using to hide data
within the blockchain, researchers can hunt for malicious transactions and recover their
payloads. If the said domains are not stored in plaintext, reversing the Glupteba samples
enables security researchers to decrypt the payload and access the embedded domains.

Using the Blockchain to Store Data
The Bitcoin blockchain can be used to store arbitrary data. This is made possible by the
OP_RETURN opcode that enables storage of up to 80 bytes of arbitrary data within the signature
script. This storage mechanism has several advantages. First, it is resilient to takedowns. Once
a transaction has been validated, there is no way to erase it – this is the nature of the
blockchain. Using this mechanism to distribute C2 domain means that law enforcement officers,
network defenders, and incident responders have no way to take down the Bitcoin address and
erase the transaction. The way the Bitcoin blockchain is built on top of modern cryptography
also makes this mechanism secure; without the Bitcoin address private key, one cannot send a
transaction with such a data payload originating from the malicious address, hence, taking over
the botnet is not possible. Additionally, threat actors can encrypt their payload from peering
eyes, making the data storage scheme robust and cost effective.
This technique has also been used by the Cerber ransomware in the past. Bitcoin transactions
originating from specific addresses were monitored and the first 6 characters of a destination
address were used along with a .top TLD appended to> generate a domain, which would be
used to query the active C2 infrastructure.
Glupteba is known to be using a similar mechanism relying on OP_RETURN instead of destination
addresses to distribute its C2 domains. In case of a C2 domain being taken down, the botnet
operators only need to send a new transaction from the Bitcoin address distributing the domains
and voila, the malware will adjust its configuration the next time the C2 is refreshed. The latest
identified Glupteba bitcoin transaction dates to the 8th of November 2022 with its embedded
payload 000c0b0006171c11064d150a0b16.
The hexadecimal payload above does not seem to represent anything close to a domain name
and that is because Glupteba uses, in its latest variant, a XOR encryption scheme to protect the
data. Once the key is known, typically by reverse engineering a sample such as
c6d4ce67dd25764f571a84caa19fa6c2b067cae6, decrypting the data becomes simple; see a
sample of this decryption in Github.

The Evolution of Glupteba

2/20

Glupteba is known to use the Bitcoin blockchain to distribute its C2 servers since at least 2019.
To retrieve the Bitcoin transactions, several providers are used, usually blockchain.com and
blockstream.info. The Glupteba function responsible for querying blockchain.com to retrieve the
transaction data is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1.

The Bitcoin address that contains the transactions with the command-and-control domains.
The way the domains are protected within the transactions has slightly evolved over time. In
2019, Glupteba used AES-GCM to protect and embed the data in the bitcoin transactions. Each
sample was shipped with a hardcoded key and initialization vector enabling the sample to
decrypt the payload from the Bitcoin transaction. Figure 2 shows the decryption routine in the
oldest Glupteba versions..

Figure 2.

The Glupteba code calling the AES-GCM decryption routine.
In newer versions of the malware, this scheme was switched to a simple XOR cipher, which is
currently being used. All samples we found were using the same key: “cheesesauce”. Figure 3
shows this key being moved around in memory in the function responsible to decrypt the
ciphertext.

Timeline of Events
Given all that information, we went on a blockchain harvesting tour, scanning the entire Bitcoin
blockchain for hidden C2 domains. We tried to decrypt the data payload of the OP_RETURN script
present in each transaction of every block using all the algorithms and keys we know to be
associated with Glupteba. In addition, we downloaded over 1500 Glupteba samples from
VirusTotal and looked at the wallet addresses they used to make sure we did not miss anything.
But that is not all: the latest set of TLS certificates Glupteba uses also exhibits a precise pattern
in the Subject Alternative Names and, thanks to certificate transparency, this can be hunted for.
Finally, we also took a close look at the passive DNS records at our disposal to find potential
associated domains and hosts.
This research gave us a massive series of events we decided to summarize with the timeline
below, showing when actions were taken by Glupteba operators.

The 4 Glupteba Campaigns
We have been able to identify 15 Glupteba bitcoin addresses spawning over 4 years and what
we believe to be 4 different campaigns.

Campaign 1
The oldest wave seems to have started in June 2019. Back then, only one single Bitcoin
address was used to distribute the malicious domains. This also corroborates what Google
found out in their lawsuit against two Glupteba operators.

Figure 4 shows a graph of the address transactions. We can see the OP_RETURN transactions
like 3Jt2U where the funds bounce back to the 15y7d address. Interestingly all the remaining
$36.18 on the 15y7d address were sent to the address 3Jwj7 in February 2020. No activity has
been observed at that address since then.

The graph shows the transaction to and from the address involved in the 2019 campaign.

Campaign 2
The second wave seems to have started in April 2020, this time two Bitcoin addresses were
used to distribute the malicious C2 domains. Interestingly we did not find any samples using the
second address; it could be a testing address to ensure the Glupteba variants were behaving as
expected. In addition, the domain distributed via the supposedly testing address
deepsound[.]live has not been seen in any other transactions we were able to find across both
addresses. It could also be that we simply are missing some samples.

Here the same pattern can be observed on the main address 1CgPC, after a period of activity,
the remaining funds accounting for $28.45 were transferred back to some vendor or merchant in
November 2021. At the supposed test Bitcoin address, the funds were not transferred and
remain to this day on the account for a balance of $76.80. Figure 5 shows the transactions to
and from both addresses.

campaign.

Campaign 3
The third campaign starts in November 2021; the number of bitcoin addresses used to deliver
malicious domain doubled, from 2 in 2020 to 4 in 2021. This campaign was the shortest of all,
with a lifespan of only about two months. We believe this is likely due to Google efforts to take
the botnet down, when about a1 year ago Google filed a lawsuit against Glupteba two operators
and several actions were taken to disrupt the botnet operations. This is also the first time TOR
hidden services were used as a command-and-control server by Glupteba.

Address

Glupteba operators used four wallets, with the most active one being 1CUha as shown in Figure
6. Again, there were no remaining funds left on the Bitcoin addresses. This is also the oldest
address in this campaign and the one with the highest number of transactions. Interestingly, we
were not able to find a single sample referring to the address 1GLjC which we believe could
have been used for testing the malware, similar to 2020. The domain used newcc[.]com was
also not registered at the time and could indicate it was used in a testing environment or we
could be missing some samples.

Figure 6.

The graph shows the transaction to and from the addresses involved in the 2021 Glupteba
campaign.

Campaign 4
The latest and ongoing campaign started in June 2022, 6 months after the Google lawsuit, and
this time the number of malicious bitcoin addresses significantly increased. We believe this is
due to several factors. First, having more Bitcoin addresses makes security researcher job more
complicated. Second, to show that the Google lawsuit did not have a major effect on their
Glupteba operations. For this campaign we were not able to find any samples for 3 of the
addresses we gathered. We believe these addresses are not made for testing as they distribute
some domains found in other Bitcoin addresses for which we found samples. In addition, there
was a tenfold increase in TOR hidden service being used as C2 servers since the 2021
campaign.

The transactions graphs shown in Figure 7 involving the addresses used in the 2022 campaign
show the upscaling of the operations since 2019. Lastly, we traced back these transactions
even further, and we believe that at least five different merchants and exchanges were used to
fund the Glupteba addresses since 2019.

Figure 7.

The graph shows the transaction to and from the addresses involved in the 2022 campaign.

Conclusion
In this blog, we have shown how Glupteba can be hunted by following blockchain transaction,
TLS certificate registrations, and by reverse engineering samples. We also had a look at how
the blockchain can be used to store arbitrary data and how threat actors leverage this in the
wild. In addition, we tried to shed some light on the Glupteba campaigns over the years. In
terms of resilience, we have seen how the actions Google took to disrupt the Glupteba botnet
had an impact on the 2021 campaign, which we believe ended abruptly. Even with Google
winning a favorable ruling recently, we hoped it would have inflicted a severe blow to Glupteba
operations, but almost a year later we can say it most likely did not. Indeed, it took Glupteba
about six months to build a new campaign from scratch and distribute it in the wild, and this time
on a much larger scale.
For defenders and responders, we strongly suggest blocking blockchain-related domains like
blockchain.info but also Glupteba known C2 domains in your environment. We also recommend
monitoring DNS logs and keeping the antivirus software up to date to help prevent a potential
Glupteba infection.
