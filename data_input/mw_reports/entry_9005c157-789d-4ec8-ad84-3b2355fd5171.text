ATT&CK Technique

DEFEND Mitigations

1/22

Initial Access

T1189 – Drive-by
Compromise:
Adversaries may gain
access to a system through
a user visiting a website
over the normal course of
browsing. With this
technique, the user's web
browser is typically targeted
for exploitation, but
adversaries may also use
compromised websites for
non-exploitation behavior
such as acquiring
Application Access Token.

M1048 - Application
Isolation and
Sandboxing:
Browser sandboxes
can be used to
mitigate some of the
impact of exploitation,
but sandbox escapes
may still exist.Other
types of virtualization
and application
microsegmentation
may also mitigate the
impact of client-side
exploitation. The risks
of additional exploits
and weaknesses in
implementation may
still exist for these
types of systems.

M1050 - Exploit Protection:
Security applications that look for
behavior used during exploitation
such as Windows Defender Exploit
Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced
Mitigation Experience Toolkit
(EMET) can be used to mitigate
some exploitation behavior. Control
flow integrity checking is another
way to potentially identify and stop a
software exploit from occurring.
Many of these protections depend
on the architecture and target
application binary for compatibility.
M1021 - Restrict Web-Based
Content:
For malicious code served up
through ads, adblockers can help
prevent that code from executing in
the first place. Script blocking
extensions can help prevent the
execution of JavaScript that may
commonly be used during the
exploitation process.

2/22

M1051 – Update Software:
Ensure all browsers and plugins kept
updated can help prevent the exploit
phase of this technique. Use modern
browsers with security features
turned on.
T1566.001 – Phishing:
Spearphishing Attachment:
Adversaries may send
spearphishing emails with a
malicious attachment in an attempt
to gain access to victim systems.
Spearphishing attachment is a
specific variant of spearphishing.
Spearphishing attachment is
different from other forms of
spearphishing in that it employs the
use of malware attached to an email.
All forms of spearphishing are
electronically delivered social
engineering targeted at a specific
individual, company, or industry.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Anti-virus can also
automatically quarantine
suspicious files.

M1031 - Network Intrusion
Prevention:
Network intrusion prevention
systems and systems designed to
scan and remove malicious email
attachments can be used to block
activity.
M1021 - Restrict Web-Based
Content:
Block unknown or unused
attachments by default that should
not be transmitted over email as a
best practice to prevent some
vectors, such as .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl,
etc. Some email scanning devices
can open and analyze compressed
and encrypted formats, such as zip
and rar that may be used to conceal
malicious attachments.

3/22

M1054 - Software Configuration:
Use anti-spoofing and email
authentication mechanisms to filter
messages based on validity checks
of the sender domain (using SPF)
and integrity of messages (using
DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms
within an organization (through
policies such as DMARC) may
enable recipients (intra-org and
cross domain) to perform similar
message filtering and validation.
M1017 - User Training: Users can be
trained to identify social engineering
techniques and spearphishing
emails.
Execution

T1059.001 – Command
and Scripting Interpreter –
PowerShell:
Adversaries may abuse
PowerShell commands and
scripts for execution.
PowerShell is a powerful
interactive command-line
interface and scripting
environment included in the
Windows operating system.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Anti-virus can be used
to automatically
quarantine suspicious
files.

M1045 - Code Signing:
Set PowerShell execution policy to
execute only signed scripts.

4/22

M1042 - Disable or Remove Feature
or Program:
It may be possible to remove
PowerShell from systems when not
needed, but a review should be
performed to assess the impact to
an environment, since it could be in
use for many legitimate purposes
and administrative functions.
Disable/restrict the WinRM Service
to help prevent uses of PowerShell
for remote execution.
M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control where
appropriate.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
When PowerShell is necessary,
restrict PowerShell execution policy
to administrators. Be aware that
there are methods of bypassing the
PowerShell execution policy,
depending on environment
configuration.
T1059.003 – Windows Command
Shell:

M1038 - Execution
Prevention:

Adversaries may abuse the
Windows command shell for
execution. The Windows command
shell (cmd) is the primary command
prompt on Windows systems.

Use application control
where appropriate.

5/22

T1059.005 – Command and
Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic:

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:

Adversaries may abuse Visual Basic
(VB) for execution. VB is a
programming language created by
Microsoft with interoperability with
many Windows technologies such
as Component Object Model and the
Native API through the Windows
API. Although tagged as legacy with
no planned future evolutions, VB is
integrated and supported in the
.NET Framework and cross-platform
.NET Core.

Anti-virus can be used to
automatically quarantine
suspicious files.

M1040 - Behavior Prevention on
Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable Attack
Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to
prevent Visual Basic scripts from
executing potentially malicious
downloaded content.
M1042 - Disable or Remove Feature
or Program:
Turn off or restrict access to
unneeded VB components.
M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control where
appropriate.
M1021 - Restrict Web-Based
Content:
Script blocking extensions can help
prevent the execution of scripts and
HTA files that may commonly be
used during the exploitation process.
For malicious code served up
through ads, adblockers can help
prevent that code from executing in
the first place.

6/22

T1106 – Native Application
Programming Interface (API)

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to prevent
Office VBA macros from
calling Win32 APIs.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Identify and block potentially
malicious software executed that
may be executed through this
technique by using application
control tools, like Windows Defender
Application Control, AppLocker, or
Software Restriction Policies where
appropriate.
T1204.002 – User Execution:
Malicious File:

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint:

An adversary may rely upon a user
opening a malicious file in order to
gain execution. Users may be
subjected to social engineering to
get them to open a file that will lead
to code execution. This user action
will typically be observed as followon behavior from Spearphishing
Attachment. Adversaries may use
several types of files that require a
user to execute them, including .doc,
.pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and
.cpl.

On Windows 10, various
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules can be enabled
to prevent the execution of
potentially malicious
executable files (such as
those that have been
downloaded and executed
by Office
applications/scripting
interpreters/email clients or
that do not meet specific
prevalence, age, or trusted
list criteria). Note: clouddelivered protection must
be enabled for certain
rules.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Application control may be able to
prevent the running of executables
masquerading as other files.

7/22

M1017 - User Training:
Use user training as a way to bring
awareness to common phishing and
spearphishing techniques and how
to raise suspicion for potentially
malicious events.
T1047 – Windows Management
Instrumentation:
Adversaries may abuse Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI)
to execute malicious commands and
payloads. WMI is an administration
feature that provides a uniform
environment to access Windows
system components.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block
processes created by WMI
commands from running.
Note: many legitimate tools
and applications utilize
WMI for command
execution.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control configured to
block execution of wmic.exe if it is
not required for a given system or
network to prevent potential misuse
by adversaries. For example, in
Windows 10 and Windows Server
2016 and above, Windows Defender
Application Control (WDAC) policy
rules may be applied to block the
wmic.exe application and to prevent
abuse.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Prevent credential overlap across
systems of administrator and
privileged accounts.

8/22

M1018 - User Account Management:
By default, only administrators are
allowed to connect remotely using
WMI. Restrict other users who are
allowed to connect, or disallow all
users to connect remotely to WMI.
Privilege Escalation

T1134.001 – Access Token
Manipulation: Token
Impersonation/Theft:

M1026 - Privileged
Account
Management:

Adversaries may duplicate
then impersonate another
user's token to escalate
privileges and bypass
access controls. An
adversary can create a new
access token that
duplicates an existing token
using DuplicateToken(Ex).
The token can then be
used with
ImpersonateLoggedOnUser
to allow the calling thread
to impersonate a logged on
user's security context, or
with SetThreadToken to
assign the impersonated
token to a thread.

Limit permissions so
that users and user
groups cannot create
tokens. This setting
should be defined for
the local system
account only. GPO:
Computer
Configuration >
[Policies] > Windows
Settings > Security
Settings > Local
Policies > User Rights
Assignment: Create a
token object. Also
define who can create
a process level token
to only the local and
network service
through GPO:
Computer
Configuration >
[Policies] > Windows
Settings > Security
Settings > Local
Policies > User Rights
Assignment: Replace
a process level token.
Administrators should
log in as a standard
user but run their
tools with
administrator
privileges using the
built-in access token
manipulation
command runas.

9/22

M1018 - User Account Management:
An adversary must already have
administrator level access on the
local system to make full use of this
technique; be sure to restrict us
T1134.002 – Access Token
Manipulation: Create Process with
Token:
Adversaries may create a new
process with a different token to
escalate privileges and bypass
access controls. Processes can be
created with the token and resulting
security context of another user
using features such as
CreateProcessWithTokenW and
runas.

M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Limit permissions so that
users and user groups
cannot create tokens. This
setting should be defined
for the local system
account only. GPO:
Computer Configuration >
[Policies] > Windows
Settings > Security Settings
> Local Policies > User
Rights Assignment: Create
a token object. Also define
who can create a process
level token to only the local
and network service
through GPO: Computer
Configuration > [Policies] >
Windows Settings >
Security Settings > Local
Policies > User Rights
Assignment: Replace a
process level token.
Administrators should log in
as a standard user but run
their tools with
administrator privileges
using the built-in access
token manipulation
command runas.

M1018 - User Account Management:
An adversary must already have
administrator level access on the
local system to make full use of this
technique; be sure to restrict users
and accounts to the least privileges

10/22

T1055 – Process Injection:
Adversaries may inject code into
processes in order to evade
process-based defenses as well as
possibly elevate privileges. Process
injection is a method of executing
arbitrary code in the address space
of a separate live process. Running
code in the context of another
process may allow access to the
process's memory, system/network
resources, and possibly elevated
privileges. Execution via process
injection may also evade detection
from security products since the
execution is masked under a
legitimate process.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint:
Some endpoint security
solutions can be configured
to block some types of
process injection based on
common sequences of
behavior that occur during
the injection process. For
example, on Windows 10,
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules may prevent
Office applications from
code injection.

M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Utilize Yama (ex:
/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope)
to mitigate ptrace based process
injection by restricting the use of
ptrace to privileged users only. Other
mitigation controls involve the
deployment of security kernel
modules that provide advanced
Defense Evasion

T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files
or Information:
Adversaries may use
Obfuscated Files or
Information to hide artifacts
of an intrusion from
analysis. They may require
separate mechanisms to
decode or deobfuscate that
information depending on
how they intend to use it.
Methods for doing that
include built-in functionality
of malware or by using
utilities present on the
system.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

11/22

T1562.001 – Impair Defenses:
Disable or Modify Tools:

M1022 - Restrict File and
Directory Permissions:

Adversaries may modify and/or
disable security tools to avoid
possible detection of their
malware/tools and activities. This
may take the many forms, such as
killing security software processes or
services, modifying / deleting
Registry keys or configuration files
so that tools do not operate properly,
or other methods to interfere with
security tools scanning or reporting
information.

Ensure proper process and
file permissions are in place
to prevent adversaries from
disabling or interfering with
security services.

M1024 - Restrict Registry
Permissions:
Ensure proper Registry permissions
are in place to prevent adversaries
from disabling or interfering with
security services.
M1018 - User Account Management:
Ensure proper user permissions are
in place to prevent adversaries from
disabling or interfering with security
services.
T1562.009 – Impair Defenses: Safe
Mode Boot:

M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:

Adversaries may abuse Windows
safe mode to disable endpoint
defenses. Safe mode starts up the
Windows operating system with a
limited set of drivers and services.
Third-party security software such as
endpoint detection and response
(EDR) tools may not start after
booting Windows in safe mode.
There are two versions of safe
mode: Safe Mode and Safe Mode
with Networking. It is possible to
start additional services after a safe
mode boot.

Restrict administrator
accounts to as few
individuals as possible,
following least privilege
principles, that may be
abused to remotely boot a
machine in safe mode.

12/22

M1054 - Software Configuration:
Ensure that endpoint defenses run in
safe mode.
T1070.004 – Indicator Removal on
Host: File Deletion:
Adversaries may delete files left
behind by the actions of their
intrusion activity. Malware, tools, or
other non-native files dropped or
created on a system by an
adversary may leave traces to
indicate to what was done within a
network and how. Removal of these
files can occur during an intrusion, or
as part of a post-intrusion process to
minimize the adversary's footprint.
T1036.005 – Masquerading: Match
Legitimate Name or Location:
Adversaries may match or
approximate the name or location of
legitimate files or resources when
naming/placing them. This is done
for the sake of evading defenses
and observation. This may be done
by placing an executable in a
commonly trusted directory (ex:
under System32) or giving it the
name of a legitimate, trusted
program (ex: svchost.exe). In
containerized environments, this
may also be done by creating a
resource in a namespace that
matches the naming convention of a
container pod or cluster.

This type of attack
technique cannot be easily
mitigated with preventive
controls since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

M1045 - Code Signing:
Require signed binaries
and images.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use tools that restrict program
execution via application control by
attributes other than file name for
common operating system utilities
that are needed.

13/22

M1022 - Restrict File and Directory
Permissions:
Use file system access controls to
protect folders such as
C:\Windows\System32.
T1112 – Modify Registry:
Adversaries may interact with the
Windows Registry to hide
configuration information within
Registry keys, remove information
as part of cleaning up, or as part of
other techniques to aid in
persistence and execution.
T1027 - Obfuscated Files or
Information:
Adversaries may attempt to make an
executable or file difficult to discover
or analyze by encrypting, encoding,
or otherwise obfuscating its contents
on the system or in transit. This is
common behavior that can be used
across different platforms and the
network to evade defenses.

M1024 - Restrict Registry
Permissions:
Ensure proper permissions
are set for Registry hives to
prevent users from
modifying keys for system
components that may lead
to privilege escalation.
M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Consider utilizing the
Antimalware Scan Interface
(AMSI) on Windows 10 to
analyze commands after
being
processed/interpreted.

M1040 - Behavior Prevention on
Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable Attack
Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to
prevent execution of potentially
obfuscated scripts.

14/22

Discovery

T1083 – File and Directory
Discovery:
Adversaries may
enumerate files and
directories or may search in
specific locations of a host
or network share for certain
information within a file
system. Adversaries may
use the information from
File and Directory
Discovery during
automated discovery to
shape follow-on behaviors,
including whether or not the
adversary fully infects the
target and/or attempts
specific actions.

T1069.002 – Permission Groups
Discovery: Domain Groups:
Adversaries may attempt to find
domain-level groups and permission
settings. The knowledge of domainlevel permission groups can help
adversaries determine which groups
exist and which users belong to a
particular group. Adversaries may
use this information to determine
which users have elevated
permissions, such as domain
administrators.
T1012 – Query Registry:
Adversaries may interact with the
Windows Registry to gather
information about the system,
configuration, and installed software.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

This type of attack
technique cannot be easily
mitigated with preventive
controls since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

This type of attack
technique cannot be easily
mitigated with preventive
controls since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

15/22

T1082 – System Information
Discovery:
An adversary may attempt to get
detailed information about the
operating system and hardware,
including version, patches, hotfixes,
service packs, and architecture.
Adversaries may use the information
from System Information Discovery
during automated discovery to
shape follow-on behaviors, including
whether or not the adversary fully
infects the target and/or attempts
specific actions.
T1614.001 – System Location
Discovery: System Language
Discovery:
Adversaries may attempt to gather
information about the system
language of a victim in order to infer
the geographical location of that
host. This information may be used
to shape follow-on behaviors,
including whether the adversary
infects the target and/or attempts
specific actions. This decision may
be employed by malware developers
and operators to reduce their risk of
attracting the attention of specific
law enforcement agencies or
prosecution/scrutiny from other
entities.
T1007 – System Service Discovery

This type of attack
technique cannot be easily
mitigated with preventive
controls since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

This type of attack
technique cannot be easily
mitigated with preventive
controls since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

This type of attack
technique cannot be easily
mitigated with preventive
controls since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

16/22

Command and Control

T1071.001 – Application
Layer Protocol: Web
Protocols:
Adversaries may
communicate using
application layer protocols
associated with web traffic
to avoid detection/network
filtering by blending in with
existing traffic. Commands
to the remote system, and
often the results of those
commands, will be
embedded within the
protocol traffic between the
client and server.

M1031 - Network
Intrusion Prevention:
Network intrusion
detection and
prevention systems
that use network
signatures to identify
traffic for specific
adversary malware
can be used to
mitigate activity at the
network level.

Protocols such as HTTP
and HTTPS that carry web
traffic may be very common
in environments. HTTP/S
packets have many fields
and headers in which data
can be concealed. An
adversary may abuse these
protocols to communicate
with systems under their
control within a victim
network while also
mimicking normal,
expected traffic.

17/22

T1573.002 – Encrypted Channel:
Asymmetric Cryptography:

M1031 - Network Intrusion
Prevention:

Adversaries may employ a known
asymmetric encryption algorithm to
conceal command and control traffic
rather than relying on any inherent
protections provided by a
communication protocol. Asymmetric
cryptography, also known as public
key cryptography, uses a keypair per
party: one public that can be freely
distributed, and one private. Due to
how the keys are generated, the
sender encrypts data with the
receiver’s public key and the
receiver decrypts the data with their
private key. This ensures that only
the intended recipient can read the
encrypted data.

Network intrusion detection
and prevention systems
that use network signatures
to identify traffic for specific
adversary malware can be
used to mitigate activity at
the network level.

M1020 - SSL/TLS Inspection:
SSL/TLS inspection can be used to
see the contents of encrypted
sessions to look for network-based
indicators of malware
communication protocols.

18/22

T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer:
Adversaries may transfer tools or
other files from an external system
into a compromised environment.
Files may be copied from an
external adversary controlled system
through the command and control
channel to bring tools into the victim
network or through alternate
protocols with another tool such as
FTP. Files can also be copied over
on Mac and Linux with native tools
like scp, rsync, and sftp.

Exfiltration

M1031 - Network Intrusion
Prevention:
Network intrusion detection
and prevention systems
that use network signatures
to identify traffic for specific
adversary malware or
unusual data transfer over
known tools and protocols
like FTP can be used to
mitigate activity at the
network level. Signatures
are often for unique
indicators within protocols
and may be based on the
specific obfuscation
technique used by a
particular adversary or tool,
and will likely be different
across various malware
families and versions.
Adversaries will likely
change tool C2 signatures
over time or construct
protocols in such a way as
to avoid detection by
common defensive tools.
T1041 – Exfiltration Over
C2 Channel:

M1057 - Data Loss
Prevention:

Adversaries may steal data
by exfiltrating it over an
existing command and
control channel. Stolen
data is encoded into the
normal communications
channel using the same
protocol as command and
control communications.

Data loss prevention
can detect and block
sensitive data being
sent over unencrypted
protocols.

19/22

M1031 - Network Intrusion
Prevention:
Network intrusion detection and
prevention systems that use network
signatures to identify traffic for
specific adversary malware can be
used to mitigate activity at the
network level. Signatures are often
for unique indicators within protocols
and may be based on the specific
obfuscation technique used by a
particular adversary or tool, and will
likely be different across various
malware families and versions.
Adversaries will likely change tool
command and control signatures
over time or construct protocols in
such a way to avoid detection by
common defensive tools.
Impact

T1485 – Data Destruction:
Adversaries may destroy
data and files on specific
systems or in large
numbers on a network to
interrupt availability to
systems, services, and
network resources. Data
destruction is likely to
render stored data
irrecoverable by forensic
techniques through
overwriting files or data on
local and remote drives

M1053 - Data
Backup:
Consider
implementing IT
disaster recovery
plans that contain
procedures for taking
regular data backups
that can be used to
restore organizational
data. Ensure backups
are stored off system
and is protected from
common methods
adversaries may use
to gain access and
destroy the backups
to prevent recovery.

20/22

T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact:
Adversaries may encrypt data on
target systems or on large numbers
of systems in a network to interrupt
availability to system and network
resources. They can attempt to
render stored data inaccessible by
encrypting files or data on local and
remote drives and withholding
access to a decryption key.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on Endpoint: On
Windows 10, enable clouddelivered protection and
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block the
execution of files that
resemble ransomware.

M1053 - Data Backup: Consider
implementing IT disaster recovery
plans that contain procedures for
regularly taking and testing data
backups that can be used to restore
organizational data. Ensure backups
are stored off system and is
protected from common methods
adversaries may use to gain access
and destroy the backups to prevent
recovery. Consider enabling
versioning in cloud environments to
maintain backup copies of storage
objects.
T1490 - Inhabit System Recovery:
Adversaries may delete or remove
built-in operating system data and
turn off services designed to aid in
the recovery of a corrupted system
to prevent recovery. Operating
systems may contain features that
can help fix corrupted systems, such
as a backup catalog, volume
shadow copies, and automatic repair
features. Adversaries may disable or
delete system recovery features to
augment the effects of Data
Destruction and Data Encrypted for
Impact.

M1053 - Data Backup:
Consider implementing IT
disaster recovery plans that
contain procedures for
taking regular data backups
that can be used to restore
organizational data. Ensure
backups are stored off
system and is protected
from common methods
adversaries may use to
gain access and destroy
the backups to prevent
recovery.

21/22

M1028 - Operating System
Configuration: Consider technical
controls to prevent the disabling of
services or deletion of files involved
in system recovery.
T1489 - Service Stop:
Adversaries may stop or disable
services on a system to render those
services unavailable to legitimate
users. Stopping critical services or
processes can inhibit or stop
response to an incident or aid in the
adversary's overall objectives to
cause damage to the environment.

M1030 - Network
Segmentation: Operate
intrusion detection,
analysis, and response
systems on a separate
network from the
production environment to
lessen the chances that an
