2. Threat Thursday: Dr. REvil Ransomware Strikes Again, Employs Double Extortion Tactics

Summary
The FBI has named the Russia-affiliated Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group REvil (also known as Sodin
or Sodinokibi) as the culprits behind attacks on the world’s largest meat supplier, JBS. These attacks
threatened the global food supply chain and serve as a reminder of the vulnerable state of critical
infrastructure worldwide.
Given the success of the REvil attacks and other similar malware, it is crucial for organizations to learn how to
prevent ransomware threats. This blog offers a brief overview of how REvil operates and offers effective
solutions for stopping these kinds of attacks in the future.
The malware acts as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and became prolific after another RaaS
group, GandCrab, shut down their operations. Security researchers have identified many similarities and code
reuse between REvil and GandCrab. REvil was first advertised on Russian language cybercrime forums and is
associated with the threat actor “Unknown” or “UNKN”.

REvil is most famously associated with recent attacks on Travelex, Acer, and Apple supplier Quanta
Computer. Acting as a RaaS, REvil relies on affiliates or partners to perform its attacks. The REvil developers
receive a percentage of all proceeds from ransom payments. Because the ransomware is distributed by
different entities, the initial infection vector can vary; typically, this is either via phishing campaigns, brute force
attacks to compromise RDP, or through software vulnerabilities. REvil is also known to be distributed by other
malware such as IcedID.

Operating System

Risk and Impact

Technical Analysis
REvil stores its configuration as an encoded resource. The first 32 bytes are the key used to decode the
configuration, which is contained in the remaining bytes:

Figure 1: REvil’s key is contained in the first 32 bytes.
Initially, REvil will fingerprint the target machine and gather system information. Before beginning the
encryption routine, REvil will kill certain processes such as email clients, SQL or other database servers,
browsers and Microsoft® Office applications to ensure it can encrypt important files belonging to the victim. It
will also remove shadow copies to prevent easy recovery.
For persistence, the ransomware creates a registry key to execute with Windows startup under:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\aDTFUAIa7j
:

Figure 2: Registry key created.

The sample analyzed also creates registry entries under HKLM\BlackLivesMatter\ containing hex values:

Figure 3: Hex values.
The malware creates a mutex: "Global\8C39F091-3A8D-46F4-DBC5-DDA17B3C63C2", to ensure it is the
only running instance. If another instance is executed, it will prompt an error message:

Figure 4: REvil error message.
REvil will enumerate files on the system and during the encryption process appends a random alpha numeric
extension between 5 and 10 characters in length, E.G.: “.oh24o8”.
A ransom note, with the same alpha-numeric name as that used for the file extensions, followed by
“readme.txt”, is dropped in all affected directories, E.G.: “oh24o8-readme.txt”:

Figure 6: REvil ransom note.
For file encryption, REvil uses curve25519/Salsa20; key encryption utilizes curve25519/AES-256-CTR. The
developers of REvil pride themselves as having created the best data encryption and decryption system
currently available.
A custom .bmp image is dropped to the %Temp% directory and this is set as the desktop wallpaper via a
registry setting. The wallpaper image informs the user that their files have been encrypted:

To pay the ransom, two URLs are provided, one accessible with the TOR browser and a secondary site which
can be used if TOR is blocked in the user’s location:

The ransom note provides the key to enter after navigating to either website. The ransom can be paid in either
Monero or Bitcoin, although if the user chooses to pay in Bitcoin, this increases the cost by 10%:

REvil also benefits from employing the effective tactic of double extortion. To encourage the victim to pay the
ransom in a timely manner, the attacker threatens to publicly disclose or sell confidential stolen information on
the dark web:

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
At BlackBerry, we take a prevention-first and AI-driven approach to cybersecurity. Putting prevention first
neutralizes malware before the exploitation stage of the kill-chain. By stopping malware at this stage,
BlackBerry solutions help organizations increase their resilience. It also helps reduce infrastructure complexity
and streamline security management to ensure business, people, and endpoints are secure.
