Russian authorities have detained earlier this month a popular figure on the Russian hacking
scene on charges of distributing malicious software via his Telegram channel.
Pavel Sitnikov, known primarily for operating the now-suspended @Flatl1ne Twitter account
and the Freedom F0x Telegram channel, was raided by law enforcement officials on May 20
at his home in the town of Velikiye Luki, in the Pskov region in Eastern Russia.

He was charged the next day under Article 273, Part 2 of Russian criminal law, and forbidden
to leave the town or use any electronic devices until his trial.

Sources close to Sitnikov have told Recorded Future analysts that the Russian hacker was
allegedly charged for posting the source code of the Anubis banking trojan on Freedom F0x,
a Telegram channel where Sitnikov often posted data leaks and malware source code under
the pretense of helping the security community.

Suspect’s wife claims arrest is payback
But in a video interview with Russian news site Readovka, which first reported on the arrest,
Sonia Sitnikov, the suspect’s wife, claimed the arrest was actually related to a post her
husband made on December 9, last year, when he shared a download link to the personal
data of more than 300,000 COVID-19 patients that registered with the Moscow Department
of Health.

The data, which contained names, phone numbers, addresses, and COVID-19 status,
sparked an outcry at the time, but Moscow officials eventually confirmed that the leak
occurred because of a human error and not because of a malicious intrusion.
Nevertheless, despite high-ranking officials admitting their mistake, Sitnikov’s wife believes
the investigation and the Anubis-related charges are payback for publicizing the leak last
December.
In an interview with The Record last year, Sitnikov touched on the sensitive nature of leaking
data from Russian companies, such as banks, and the reason he did it.
This data is obtained either from the banks themselves, or fraudulently by various
cybercriminal groups or researchers. Either sold or leaked publicly. As long as the
knowledge about the leak is hidden and not publicized, people affected by the leak
continue to suffer. As soon as it is announced, the most important thing is that at least
for the moment those who are mentioned in the leak think about their security.

Suspect faces up to five years in prison
Sitnikov, who at one point claimed to have connections to Russian state-sponsored hacking
group APT28 (Fancy Bear), has a long and muddled history on the cybercrime underground.
A member of multiple underground hacking communities, Sitnikov previously sold and
shared the source code of multiple malware strains, such as Carberp, Dexter, Alina, Rovnix,
and Tinba; hence the reason why the recent charges did not surprise those who followed his
past activity.
Under Article 273, Part 2 of Russian criminal law, Sitnikov risks up to five years in prison.
