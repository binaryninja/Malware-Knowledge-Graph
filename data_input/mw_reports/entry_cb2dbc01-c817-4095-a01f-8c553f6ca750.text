Cloud Atlas Navigates Us Into New Waters
domaintools.com/resources/blog/cloud-atlas-navigates-us-into-new-waters

Executive Summary
Taking recent Cloud Atlas nameserver activity as a starting point, the DomainTools
researchers enumerated a potential sinkhole network containing hundreds of previously
known malicious domains spanning dozens of campaigns. Using this domain knowledge,
defenders and researchers can make inferences during day-to-day analysis such as the
end point of a campaign or whether or not a particular sample is still dangerous.
Additionally, DomainTools researchers provide a working method for enumerating
infrastructure based on nameserver activity.

Background
In the past six months, DomainTools researchers have investigated multiple campaigns
from the entity known as Cloud Atlas or Inception. As mentioned prior, Cloud Atlas’
targeting spans a number of government entities and industries, primarily in parts of the
former Soviet Union and Europe, but has been actively seen across Asia, North America,
and the Middle East as well. Cloud Atlas makes use of template injection to load malicious
payloads on victim systems and spread their C2 infrastructure across a variety of cloud
providers which makes tracking their activities a bit more difficult.

Nameserver Movement
On May 26, DomainTools researchers observed previously known Cloud Atlas domains
transitioning their NS records from bitdomain[.]biz to one of three new nameservers that
each contain roughly 150 domains that the DomainTools data science team’s risk scoring
rates at a high risk for maliciousness. The original nameserver, bitdomain[.]biz, belongs to a
discount hosting provider that accepts Bitcoin for payment, a common feature in APT group
hosting provider choice. A number of unrelated domains exist on bitdomain[.]biz so this is
not exclusive to Cloud Atlas and neither is the movement to these other nameservers.

The movement between nameservers can be indicative of a number of things, but first and
foremost movement means that there was interaction with the domain as someone or some
process had to change the record. Many malicious domains, after use, are left to become
stale but a domain moving between nameservers indicates that there is another intent left
for that domain. This could be the final steps in a well organized campaign’s cleanup
process, a further aging of the domain for other campaigns in the future, or movement to
other infrastructure for a myriad reasons.
Since these domains are each less than 100 days old, they have not yet expired on their
original registration, so this isn’t a “drop catch” situation. These nameservers also do not
belong to any sinkholes that DomainTools researchers are aware of at this time. Lastly, the
two-by-two pairing seems like an odd pattern since one would assume sinkhole
infrastructure would keep domains from the same campaign on the same servers for
measuring telemetry.

Examining New Nameservers
The domains behind these new nameservers, which Cloud Atlas has not previously been
seen using, are well aged between the three of them with over five and a half years for an
average age. With youth being a heavy indicator in maliciousness prediction products
across the cyber threat intelligence industry, many threat actors have begun turning to well
aged domain reseller services or trying to catch domains that have recently dropped from
their registration. A prime example of this could be the avsvmcloud[.]com domain used in
the high-profile SolarWinds supply chain compromise earlier this year. In this case, we have
a long, contiguous set of ownership records in historical Whois for the domains attached to
these nameservers so none of the above possibilities seem to fit here.
2/13

The top IP address looks to belong to a domain parking provider that has been around
since 2010. However, the bottom two addresses point to Amazon EC2 nodes that are
running just DNS services on port 53, acting as a DNS forwarding service -- a sign this may
be an unknown sinkhole. Digging into a history of domains that have resided on these
nameservers ties them to other maliciousness, such as the .NET RAT SamoRAT’s domain
samorat[.]com which resides on newregs-domain[.]com until May 19, 2021 or the domain
360mediashare[.]com seen distributing another RAT via phishing emails in late 2020. In
fact, the same goes for the domain-transition1[.]com nameserver which hosts domains such
as porkhalal[.]site which the Zusy banking trojan has been observed using for C2 and
alhajikudi[.]com which has been observed in traffic of other malware samples in early 2021.
As DomainTools researchers looked further into these nameservers and the domains
contained on them, it became apparent that this must be a domain reseller network or a
sinkhole telemetry network due to the large swath of known malicious domains transitioning
through these nameservers over time. DomainTools’ own proximity risk scoring rated all of
these related domains an average of 80 due simply to their proximity to known malicious
infrastructure on industry standard blocklists. Typically, in the experience of DomainTools
researchers, a scoring above 70 means that a domain should not be trusted and should be
investigated further. It became apparent that mapping this network would be a useful
exercise.

Looking For More Nameservers
With these bottom two domains there is a pattern we can treat as a composite object for
hunting additional infrastructure:
They have nameservers that are hosted on the domain themselves.
This domain is hosted on Amazon’s AWS on an EC2 node.
The domain contains a dash.

3/13

The emails in the Whois record have both privacyprotect[.]org and bigrock[.]com in the
record.
Searching for these features in the DomainTools Iris Investigate data set reveals a total of 5
additional domains that DomainTools researchers can say with high confidence belong to
the same clustering:

Note the misspelling in suspended-domians[.]com. Expanding on these nameservers
reveals just over 1,086 domains, most of which have been involved in some sort of
cybercrime activity in the past. Of those 1,086 domains none of them had a reseller page
when navigating to the domain which domain resale companies use to signal that the
domain is for sale. Lastly, DomainTools Research noticed that all of the domains associated
with those nameservers pointed to one of 3 IP addresses, spread across all nameservers,
that definitively tied this clustering together.
4/13

IPs of Nameserver Cluster
18.235.92[.]123
50.17.5[.]224
54.227.98[.]220
Inverting the search from nameserver properties to solely A records reveals a single site as
an outlier: dropbox-download[.]com. It is an outlier because it contains a different
nameserver in domain-imminent3[.]com, a naming schema nearly identical to one of the
nameservers associated with the original Cloud Atlas movement at the beginning of this
report, domain-imminent[.]com. Of note is that the dropbox-download[.]com domain here is
associated with TA505, the group behind the Dridex banking trojan, from a campaign they
ran over two years ago.

Viewing all domains on domain-imminent3[.]com, repeating the process from above, reveals
another common IP address (52.6.206[.]192) spanning multiple new nameservers including
domain-imminent1[.]com, domain-imminent2[.]com. The inclusion of these final two
nameservers contain a recent lapse in privacy protection on the Whois record and an email
address of resellerclub@protonmail[.]com that is tied to them.

5/13

This email in historical Whois records ties to 20 records total that span most of the
nameservers DomainTools researches enumerated. On top of that, many of the domains in
that group—including elsewhere in the list of total domains—move to the nameservers at
foundationapi[.]com at one point or another, a property of Endurance International Group, a
company in the domain and web services space that owns a number of properties including
BigRock, HostGator, and ResellerClub.

6/13

ResellerClub allows for the bulk resale of domains. Searching on their documentation you
can see the use of foundationapi[.]com as a backend as well as the services and pricing
they offer for bulk domain purchases.

The Domain Swamp
Expanding across the domains tied to all nameservers there are a total of 1,378 domains,
559 of which are on known industry blocklists for malware and on average score above 80
in the DomainTools Risk Score engine. Going through those 1,378 domains, none could be
found on domain auction sites or for sale, so this further backs up the potential that this is a
sinkhole network run by the Endurance International Group or one of their subsidiaries. To
show the broad swath of domains and campaigns associated, DomainTools researchers
coupled one nameserver’s holdings, domain-imminent1[.]com, with Alienvault OTX pulses
below.

Conclusion
12/13

At this point DomainTools researchers are led to believe that these nameservers are a
holding pen for known malicious domains on the reseller network until they can be resold or
are actively being used as a sinkhole by the reseller network for telemetry. Since
DomainTools researchers cannot find a description of the sinkhole network or any of that
telemetry being posted elsewhere online, defenders can only assume that this is a private
sinkhole network associated with Endurance.

Lessons for Defenders
If you are an analyst working with malicious software or mapping adversary infrastructure,
knowing of these dead zones in domain data so that you do not get distracted by them
when trying to map live infrastructure is key to efficiently researching threats. For threat
hunters, watching the transitioning of domains on and off these nameservers, through a tool
like the DomainTools Nameserver Monitor, can provide ample domains for hunting queries
on public repositories of malicious binaries and lead to pivots of fresh, un-sinkholed
infrastructure.
