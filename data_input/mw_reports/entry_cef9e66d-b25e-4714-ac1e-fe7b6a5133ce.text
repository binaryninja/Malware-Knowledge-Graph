A new ransomware has been spotted over the weekend, carrying references to the Russian
president and antivirus software. The researchers call it Nemty.
This is the first version of Nemty ransomware, named so after the extension it adds to the
files following the encryption process.

The ransom demand
Like any proper file-encrypting malware, Nemty will delete the shadow copies for the files it
processes, taking away from the victim the possibility to recover versions of the data as
created by the Windows operating system.
Victims will see a ransom note informing that the attackers hold the decryption key and that
data is recoverable for a price.

In BleepingComputer's tests, the ransom demand was 0.09981 BTC, which converts to
around $1,000 at the moment.
The payment portal is hosted on the Tor network for anonymity, and users have to upload
their configuration file.
Based on this, they are provided with the link to another website that comes with a chat
function and more information on the demands.

Messages in the code
Security researcher Vitali Kremez took a closer look at the malware and noticed that it
comes with an unusual name for the mutex object. The author called it "hate," as visible in
the image below.

A mutually exclusive (mutex) object is a flag that allows programs to control resources by
allowing access to them to one execution thread at a time.
Another weird thing Kremez noticed in Nemty's code is a link to this picture of Vladimir
Putin, with a caption saying "I added you to the list of [insult], but only with pencil for now."
The list of peculiarities does not stop at this. A straight message to the antivirus industry
was spotted by the researcher.
At first, the reference seemed an odd thing in the code but a second look at how Nemty
worked revealed that it was the key for decoding base64 strings and create URLs is a
straight message to the antivirus industry.

Another interesting thing is a verification Nemty makes to identify computers in Russia,
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Ukraine. This is not to exempt the hosts from the file
encryption routine, though, Kremez told BleepingComputer.
The "isRU" check in the malware code simply marks the systems as being in one of the five
countries and then sends to the attacker data that includes the computer name, username,
operating system, and computer ID.

It's unclear how Nemty is distributed but Kremez heard from a reliable source that the
operators deploy it via compromised remote desktop connections.
Compared to phishing email, which is currently the common distribution method, leveraging
a RDP connection puts the attacker in control as they no longer have to wait for the victim
to take the phishing bait.
Kremez published his research notes on Nemty where he includes the list of folders
(anything needed for booting the OS) and the file extensions (binaries, shortcuts, and log
data) the malware does not touch.
