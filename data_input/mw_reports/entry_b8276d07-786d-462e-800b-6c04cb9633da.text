Aug 28 Morto / Tsclient - RDP worm with DDoS features
contagiodump.blogspot.com/2011/08/aug-28-morto-tsclient-rdp-worm-with.html

According to Microsoft, Morto is a worm that spreads by trying to compromise (lame)
administrator passwords for Remote Desktop connections on a network. They also note it
can perform Denial of Service attacks against attacker-specified targets.
I can add that it runs what it looks like a quick DoS test against one Google IP. In addition, it
creates a lot of traffic: RDP scans, downloads, receiving commands, and interesting DNS
queries for command and control servers.

Judging by the domain owners of CC servers (China) and their location (Hong Kong), I would
say it is likely it be cybercrimeware originating in erm,...Asia. I don't know how difficult it is for
a foreigner to register domains with Jiangsu Bangning Science & technology Co. Ltd.in
China. One of the domains existed for a few years and changed several Chinese registrars
and hosting companies. Like in Russia, DDoS attack crimes are very common in China (I
don't have stats for other Asian countries but I am guessing common there too :)
I want to thank jsunpack.jeek.org and malc0de.com for the sample.

Exploit information and analysis links
Windows Remote Desktop worm "Morto" spreading (F-Secure )
Expert analysis has been done already and I won't repeat it. I ran the sample posted and it
does what the links below describe
Worm:Win32/Morto.A Analysis by Matt McCormack (Microsoft)

Excerpt from Microsoft:
The malware consists of several components, including an executable dropper
component (the installer), and a DLL component which performs the payload.
When the dropper is executed, the DLL component is installed to the Windows
directory as clb.dll. If updated by the malware, backups are created as clb.dll.bak.The
executable component also writes encrypted code to the registry key
HKLM\SYSTEM\WPA\md and exits.
The name clb.dll is chosen because it is the name of a real DLL (located in the System
directory), which is used by regedit. To load this malware DLL, a regedit process is
spawned by the malware. Once regedit is executed, it loads the malicious clb.dll
preferentially over the real clb.dll due to the way in which Windows searches for files
(i.e. the Windows directory is searched before the System directory). This dll has
encrypted configuration information appended to it in order to download and execute
new components.
The following additional files are also created:
%windows%\temp\ntshrui.dll
\sens32.dll
c:\windows\offline web pages\cache.txt
Technet forum discussions
Some screenshots
contents of cache.txt in offline web pages folder

They may be replaced later on with malicious components which are
downloaded to:
c:\windows\offline web pages\cache.txt

Traffic
As you already noted, it is a worm capable of spreading through local area network. Please
remember this when running it on a VM attached to any LAN. Take appropriate measures to
prevent it from spreading.
From what I see, it performs DNS queries using servers that are not in the victim's TCP/IP
configuration

According to Microsoft (and the samples they analysed ), morto

Worm:Win32/Morto.A connects to the following hosts in order to download additional
information and update its components:

Morto may be ordered to perform Denial of Service attacks against attacker-specified
targets.
