The Zirconium group successfully created and operated 28 fake ad agencies to distribute
malvertising campaigns through 2017, buying an estimate of 1 billion ad views throughout the
year, and reaching 62% of ad-monetized websites on a weekly basis.

Forced redirects
Through 2016 and 2017, the prevalence of exploit kits in online advertising has decreased, as browsers became more secure. A
few drivers explain this evolution:
The standardization of browser sandboxes (not only Chrome/Safari but now Firefox and Edge)

1/20

The decline of Adobe Flash as a vector for exploit kits, accelerated by the ban of Flash ads in Google Chrome from
September 2015
The high profile demise of Angler Exploit Kit in June 2016
The rise of exploit detection and sophisticated telemetry that uncovers attacks in spite of evasion
As a consequence, many malvertising campaigns moved to “forced redirects” as the second best attack vector. A forced redirect
is when a person is surfing the web on a computer or mobile device and through no action of their own gets redirected to a
different website. Usually the website they are redirected to is a vehicle for some form of affiliate fraud or malware.
Although forced redirects require social engineering (tricking users into falling for a scam or infecting their computer), they can
durably stay under the radar by avoiding to trigger in situations that may correspond to security investigations.

Execution and chain of redirection

Fig. 1: Redirection flow
Beginads was only briefly used to establish relationships with ad platforms as a fake ad agency. Confiant observed it as a standalone ad server in March 2017, but it later became the domain that acts as the TDS (Traffic Direction System) on behalf of all the
campaigns running on all the fake agencies’ ad servers.
Zirconium established a well thought-out organization to maximize both Supply (user traffic) and Demand (landing pages).
Supply is brought in by the fake agencies, establishing relationships with legitimate ad platforms, and buying traffic. Having
multiple relationships makes the operation more robust (in case an agency gets caught) and stealthier — as each agency poses
as a long-tail small business agency and buys small amounts at a time.
Aggregating Demand is the other key component to Zirconium’s business model. Confiant established that Zirconium does not
operate these landing pages on their own. Instead, they resell the traffic to affiliate marketing platforms.

Maintaining those relationships at the agency level would have been cumbersome and inefficient. Beginads.com became the
central gateway to manage the demand. Just like a legitimate advertising operation, this requires constant optimization and
testing to yield the most revenue. Beginads.com became the centralized place were Zirconium could rationalize its revenue.

MyAdsBro, the not-fake ad network by Zirconium
Confiant found yet another level of redirection between Beginads / Horizon-media and the affiliate networks, going by the name
“MyAdsBro” and operated by Zirconium.
Essentially, Zirconium’s own campaigns run via MyAdsBro but anyone can also push traffic to it and leave a revenue commission
to them. MyAdsBro claims to pay out in crypto-currencies.
Going as far as to build a black-hat affiliate network shows the level of sophistication that they reached in their operations.

Previous research by @ExecuteMalware identified Zirconium’s PlaiMedia serving landing pages operated by the Kovter Group.
Another large malvertising operation, Kovter has embraced social engineering schemes in recent years. [Edit Jan 24] After
review and feedback from Kaffeine at ProofPoint, there is no evidence that ties Zirconium to Kovter.

ROI and Evasion
Just like any other business, malvertising is driven by return on investment. But crucially, it needs to operate behind sophisticated
evasion techniques. This means that only a small portion of the acquired traffic actually delivers a payload. Using Confiant’s
telemetry, we estimate the group served in the order of 1 billion ad impressions through 2017.
Starting in October, the group became more aggressive at optimizing for ROI, at the risk of more overtly showing suspicious
activity, by using “fingerprinting”. Fingerprinting is the process of gathering data on the browser/device to target a subset of the
audience. The goal is to evade detection, and this is typically done from within the browser in JavaScript. Attackers decrease
their chances of delivering their payload to security scanners, which means they can trigger their payload more often and
increase their ROI. This is a risky endeavor because this javascript is visible to anyone paying attention.

Fingerprinting
Fingerprinting is a client-side mechanism (javascript) used by attackers to forge a signature of the browser / device, focusing on
minute differences between a realistic user environment and a researcher / scanner / bot environment.
Alternatively, server-side mechanisms are more evasive because they cannot be inspected by a security researcher, unless they
actually trigger. Such mechanisms include detecting the type of connectivity used by the user, by looking up the “ASN” from the
browser client’s IP. Datacenter IPs are commonly used in ad scanners and attackers will ensure that absolutely no payload
triggers under a datacenter IP.

10/20

Server-side is more wasteful than client-side, it involves serving large volumes of ads that do not trigger their payload.
Client-side brings more data to assess the user so allows for more aggressive payload triggers, but the mere fact of collecting
this data exposes the attacker and so is more risky.
Confiant observed Zirconium switching to more javascript fingerprinting roughly from October. We believe this trend was
accompanied by an increase in traffic.

Fig. 6: Javascript fingerprinting used in Zirconium’s AdTekMedia malvertising campaign
This code snippet was found in one of the ads served by the “adtekmedia” agency. Note the odd “RegExp” override for matching
the user agent to expected browsers. Zirconium campaigns have been observed to exclusively target desktop browsers,
excluding mobile — not only targeting Windows, but also Mac, ChromeOS and even Linux.
Aside from very basic data points like the user agent, they also check:
Hardware concurrency: How many cores in the CPU?
Availability of webGL APIs
Availability of Chrome-specific objects in JavaScript
Virtual machines typically don’t expose the full set of CPU cores available at the hardware level. This is true both in cloud
computing (where scanners run) and on researchers virtual environments.
WebGL is only available in “real” full-featured modern browser. Most importantly, WebGL leaks the GPU chipset powering the
device’s graphics rendering. Cloud machines typically lack a GPU.
Identifying Chrome-specific javascript objects allows the attacker to identify potential user agent spoofing. When a Chrome
browser declares itself as an IE browser for example, the attacker can pick up that inconsistency.

11/20

By checking these elements, the attackers can weed out the traffic that corresponds more to patterns found in researchers rather
than victims.
Beyond evasion, malvertising actors want to keep fake traffic away from their campaigns, to maximize conversion rates. Similar
fingerprinting / anti-bot technique was very recently documented in the RIG Exploit Kit.

Clumsy beginnings
On March 15, 2017 IndiaOnClick made its entrance in online advertising exchanges.
The website was a poorly executed copy-cat of a large ad exchange.

IndiaOnClick was later revamped, with an original design and original content — just like the other 27 ad agencies that Zirconium
operated.

Reaching a massive scale
Everything is the same but everything is different: Each of the companies has been staged with a deliberate effort to
Fake CEO personas with LinkedIn presence like Ferdinand Konrad (98 connections), and countless others.

Stock business photos (laptop and a coffee, suits in a meeting room, …)
Regular social media posts with seemingly machine-generated content.
Efforts to generate unique content, especially branded photos with marketing messages.
From a technical perspective, each fake company is operated by a completely independent infrastructure, from hosting to SSL
servers to domain registration. Ad serving code is unique to each fake company.

Social Media content generation
Zirconium leverages a mysterious “marketing-o-tron” to generate automated content on social media via bots.
As of this writing, the bots are still active. Here’s a sample of deep marketing mantras for January 10, 2018, as found on Twitter:

14/20

“There can’t be any peak prices for your online campaigns”
- ElixMedia
“You must choose a valuable approach to all online campaigns”
- DeshMedia
“The best way to solve online ad problems is to use quality packs from k5market“- K5Market
“There must be an array of options to provide quality online services”
- HoffmanBroker
“Without a doubt, it is very important to have a chance to take a credit at the beginning of the advertising”- Face2Trade
“This company doesn’t make naked promises about the quality of provided services”- MediaParade
“We always allow our clients to use our online services for free”
- GrandonMedia
Zirconium’s concept is to build independant marketing brands from scratch, en-masse. The vast majority went live in March/April
2017 according to Twitter account creation dates. At the date of this writing, 8 remain unused, ready to be leveraged when the
ones currently exploited dry out.
In each case, Confiant found that the attacker was acquiring/building a large amount of media at once to support their
malvertising campaigns, which then trickled down over months.
Long tail ad agencies are numerous and widely embraced by the ad industry. Zirconium was extremely successful at replicating
the “small business” ad agency style. The attackers successfully built direct business relationships with as many as 16 ad
platforms.
Leveraging a swarm of fake ad agencies gives a strong justification for running custom ad servers, a critical part of the scheme
because it allows for javascript execution on websites running ads.

Dormant ad agencies
Out of the 28 fake ad agencies, only 20 ever had any activity in advertising markets. We believe Zirconium was progressively
rolling out their agencies to overcome occasional bans, as they progressively got caught. We observed a pace of 1 to 3 releases
per month. Since the majority of agencies were created around February 2017, the dormant ones progressively built precious
reputation (mostly history, and social media following) to pose as established companies and maximize their potential of striking
deals with more ad platforms.
The group had also recently started to come up with new agencies, like Big Shark Media (November 2017).

A sophisticated legal structure
Thanks to cooperation with partners in the ad industry, Confiant identified the legal entity fronting the Zirconium activity as Cape
Diamond LP, a shell company incorporated in Scotland with partners in the Seychelles — Damitra Group LTD and Lamen
Business LTD.
The Zirconium business model is capital intensive and it makes sense that they would need to shield themselves behind an
opaque offshore corporate structure.
Through 2017, both offshore companies have been extensively involved in online fraud activities, some of which crypto-currency
related, most notably btc-e.com — a crypto exchange shut down by the US authorities in June 2017.

Conclusion
The Chrome team announced that forced redirects will be blocked in Chrome 64 scheduled for release on January 23. Google is
fixing the hole that largely allows for this illegal business to thrive. They’ve already proven their adaptability and this will shift their
efforts to some new threat vectors. Confiant will be here to greet them!
