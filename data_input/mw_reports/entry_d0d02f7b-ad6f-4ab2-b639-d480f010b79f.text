STRONTIUM: Detecting new patterns in credential
harvesting

September 10, 2020

Microsoft has tied STRONTIUM to a newly uncovered pattern of Office365 credential
harvesting activity aimed at US and UK organizations directly involved in political elections.
Analysts from Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Identity Security
have been tracking this new activity since April 2020. Credential harvesting is a known tactic
used by STRONTIUM to obtain valid credentials that enable future surveillance or intrusion
operations. Subsequent analysis revealed that between September 2019 and June 2020,
STRONTIUM launched credential harvesting attacks against tens of thousands of accounts
at more than 200 organizations. In the two weeks between August 18 and September 3, the
same attacks targeted 6,912 accounts belonging to 28 organizations. None of these
accounts were successfully compromised.
Not all the targeted organizations were election-related. However, we felt it important to
highlight a potential emerging threat to the 2020 US Presidential Election and future electoral
contests in the UK.
Microsoft CVP Customer Security and Trust, Tom Burt provided some additional details on
this campaign in his recent On The Issues blog post. The purpose of this post is to provide
defenders in any organization, but especially those directly or indirectly affiliated with
electoral systems, insight into the technical nature of this activity. By providing these details,
we hope to enable better defense against future attacks and share best practices for
securing cloud environments against this type of activity.

Tactical Details
STRONTIUM relied heavily upon spear phishing in its credential harvesting efforts leading up
to the 2016 US presidential election. In 2016, spear-phishing was the most common tactic for
stealing credentials from targeted accounts. This time around, STRONTIUM appears to be
taking a different approach, namely, brute-force/password-spray tooling. This shift in tactics,
also made by several other nation-state actors, allows them to execute large-scale credential
harvesting operations in a more anonymized manner. The tooling STRONTIUM is using
routes its authentication attempts through a pool of approximately 1,100 IPs, the majority
associated with the Tor anonymizing service. This pool of infrastructure has evolved over
time, with an average of approximately 20 IPs added and removed from it per day.
STRONTIUM’s tooling alternates its authentication attempts amongst this pool of IPs
approximately once per second. Considering the breadth and speed of this technique, it
seems likely that STRONTIUM has adapted its tooling to use an anonymizer service to
obfuscate its activity, evade tracking, and avoid attribution.
During the two-week period, August 19 – September 3, STRONTIUM’s credential harvesting
tooling utilized a daily average of 1,294 IPs associated with 536 netblocks and 273 ASNs. Of
these netblocks, some were much more heavily utilized by the tooling than others, both in
terms of the total number of authentications attempted from them and the total number of IPs
utilized within them. Figure 1 below represents the 5 netblocks from which the highest
number of total auth attempts were observed. As highlighted in the table, several of these
netblocks had much higher IP utilization rates than the rest. This observed behavior indicates
that the underlying anonymization services providing the infrastructure backbone for
STRONTIUM auth attempts are, in a sense, over-serving IPs in these specific netblocks.

The fact that the anonymization service is over-serving specific netblocks gives defenders an
opportunity to hunt for activity associated both with this STRONTIUM activity or other
malicious tooling that is utilizing the same anonymization service. The following Azure

Sentinel query (GitHub link) is designed to identify failed authentication attempts from the
three highest-signal, highest-utilization netblocks highlighted above, and group the results by
UserAgent.

Microsoft Threat Protection (MTP) also provides a platform for users to identify failed
authentication attempts. The following query will give MTP users the ability to hunt and
address these threats as well:

MSTIC has observed that the STRONTIUM tooling operates in two modes when targeting
accounts: brute-force and password-spray.
In password-spray mode, the tooling attempts username: password combinations in a
‘low-‘n-slow’ manner. Organizations targeted by the tooling running in this mode typically see
approximately four authentication attempts per hour per targeted account over the course of
several days or weeks, with nearly every attempt originating from a different IP address.
In brute-force mode, the tooling attempts many username: password attempts very rapidly
for a much shorter time period. Organizations targeted by the tooling running in this mode
typically see over 300 authentication attempts per hour per targeted account over the course
of several hours or days.

Organizations targeted by STRONTIUM using this tooling saw auth attempts against an
average of 20% of their total accounts. In some instances, MSTIC assesses the tooling may
have discovered these accounts simply by attempting authentications against a large
number of possible account names until it found ones that were valid.

Guidance: Proactive defense
There are some very simple steps businesses and targeted individuals can take to
significantly improve the security of their accounts and make these types of attacks much
more difficult.
1. Enable multi-factor authentication
We have seen clear proof that enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) across both
business and personal email accounts successfully thwarts the majority of credential
harvesting attacks. Our colleagues in Azure Active Directory put it more precisely—
“… doing any form of MFA takes you out of reach of most attacks. MFA (using any
mechanism) is just too costly to break – unless a highly motivated attacker is after that
high-value account or asset.”
Blog: Your password doesn’t matter—but MFA does!
However, most enterprise accounts have not implemented this simple protection:
“When we evaluate all the tokens issued with MFA claims, we see that less than 10%
of users use MFA per month in our enterprise accounts (and that includes onpremises and third-party MFA). Until MFA is more broadly adopted, there is little reason
for attackers to evolve.”

2. Actively monitor failed authentications

4/5

When monitoring login activity in your accounts, look for any type of discernable patterns in
these failed authentications and track them over time. Password spray is an increasingly
common tactic of nation-state actors.
You can also maintain broader visibility into behavioral anomalies like failed login attempts by
running detections and monitoring using Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) which
monitors user sessions for third-party cloud apps, including G-Suite, AWS, and Salesforce.
The MCAS detection engine looks for anomalous user activity for indicators of compromise.
One indicator, “multiple failed login attempts,” can be used to create a dynamic baseline per
user, across the tenant, and alert on anomalous login behavior that may represent an active
brute force or password spray attack.
Microsoft Threat Protection (MTP) can help to automatically track and rebuild the Incident
view of all the compromised identities by password-spray leveraged later by the attacker to
expand the breach to endpoint or cloud assets.
3. Test your organization’s resilience
Attack Simulator in Office 365 ATP lets you run realistic, but simulated phishing and
password attack campaigns in your organization. Pick a password and then run the
campaign against as many users as you want. The results will let you know how many
people are using that password. Use the data to train users and build your custom list of
banned passwords.
