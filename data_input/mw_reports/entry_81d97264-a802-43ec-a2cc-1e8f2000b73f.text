Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Inve
the Department of Defense (DoD). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the N
government. This malware variant has been identified as HOTCROISSANT. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North K
as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activi
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use
should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI C
(CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This report looks at a full-featured beaconing implant. This sample performs a custom XOR network encoding and is capable of many features inc
system surveys, file upload/download, process and command execution, and performing screen captures.

Description

The sample performs dynamic DLL importing and API lookups using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress on obfuscated strings in an attempt to hide
network functions. However, only a small number of API calls are obfuscated this way, and their selection is not consistent through the sample.
The sample obfuscates strings used for API lookups as well as the strings used during the network handshake using a simple Byte xor with 0x0f.
The sample attempts to connect to a hardcoded C2 IP and then immediately sends itâ€™s Victim Info. It then listens for commands from the C2 and r
Network communications are first zipped and then encoded with a custom xor algorithm. The session structure (Figure 1), packet format (Figure 2
(Figure 3), a Python 3 script to decrypt network traffic, and implant functionality (Figure 4) are given below.

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
