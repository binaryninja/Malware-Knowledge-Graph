Fighting an emerging cybercrime trend

On July 16, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) again secured a court order to take down
malicious infrastructure used by cybercriminals. As we continually explore new ways to
combat emerging trends and techniques to better protect our customers, we filed this case to
target the use of “homoglyph” – or imposter – domains that are increasingly being used in a
variety of attacks. As a result, a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia issued a court order
requiring domain registrars to disable service on malicious domains that have been used to
impersonate Microsoft customers and commit fraud.
These malicious homoglyphs exploit similarities of alpha-numeric characters to create
deceptive domains to unlawfully impersonate legitimate organizations. For example, a
homoglyph domain may utilize characters with shapes that appear identical or very similar to
the characters of a legitimate domain, such as the capital letter “O” and the number “0” (e.g.
MICROSOFT.COM vs. MICR0S0FT.COM) or an uppercase “I” and a lowercase “l” (e.g.
MICROSOFT.COM vs. MlCROSOFT.COM). We continue to see this technique used in
business email compromise (BEC), nation state activity, malware and ransomware
distribution, often combined with credential phishing and account compromise to deceive
victims and infiltrate customer networks.

This case started with a single customer complaint regarding BEC, and our investigation
revealed that this criminal group had created 17 additional malicious homoglyph domains
that were registered with third parties. The targets are predominantly small businesses
operating in North America across several industries. Based on the techniques deployed, the
criminals appear to be financially motivated, and we believe they are part of an extensive
network that appears to be based out of West Africa.
In this BEC attack, these fraudulent domains, together with stolen customer credentials,
were used by cybercriminals to unlawfully access and monitor accounts. The group
proceeded to gather intelligence to impersonate these customers in an attempt to trick
victims into transferring funds to the cybercriminals. Once the criminals gained access to a
network, they imitated customer employees and targeted their trusted networks, vendors,
contractors and agents in an effort to deceive them into sending or approving fraudulent
financial payments.
In this instance, the criminals identified a legitimate email communication from the
compromised account of an Office 365 customer referencing payment issues and asking for
advice on processing payments. The criminals capitalized on this information and sent an
impersonation email from a homoglyph domain using the same sender name and nearly
identical domain. The only difference between the genuine communication and the imposter
communication was a single letter changed in the mail exchange domain, done to escape
notice of the recipient and deceive them into believing the email was a legitimate
communication from a known trusted source. As seen in the example below, these criminals
used the same subject line and format of an email from the earlier, legitimate conversation,
but falsely claimed a hold had been placed on the account by the CFO, time was running out
and payment needed to be received as soon as possible.

Often, once detected or addressed by Microsoft through technical means, these criminals
move their malicious infrastructure outside the Microsoft ecosystem and onto third-party
services in an attempt to continue their illegal activities. With this case, we secured an order
which eliminates the defendants’ ability to move these domains to other providers. The
action will further allow us to diminish the criminals’ capabilities and, more importantly, obtain
additional evidence to undertake further disruptions inside and outside court. This disruption
effort follows 23 previous legal actions against malware and nation-state groups that we’ve
taken in collaboration with law enforcement and other partners since 2010.
Microsoft goes to great lengths to protect customer accounts. Office 365 uses real-time antispam and multiple anti-malware engines to prevent threats from reaching their inboxes.
Microsoft also offers Defender for Office 365, which helps protect customers against new,
sophisticated attacks in real time. When we identify customer accounts that have been
targeted or compromised, such as the ones in today’s court order, or where our
investigations uncover homoglyph domains impersonating customers, we provide notice
through the Microsoft 365 Message Center.

Cybercriminals are getting more sophisticated. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit will continue to
fight cybercrime with our comprehensive efforts to disrupt the malicious infrastructure used
by criminals, through referrals to law enforcement, civil legal actions on behalf of our
customers such as this one, or technical measures in partnership with our product and
service teams. Organizations should regularly check for messages in the Microsoft 365
Message Center and can follow these steps to prevent BEC attacks.
