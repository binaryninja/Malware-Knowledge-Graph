WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As diplomats gathered at the African Union’s headquarters earlier
this year to prepare for its annual leaders’ summit, employees of the international
organization made a disturbing discovery.

Acting on a tip from Japanese cyber researchers, the African Union’s (AU) technology
staffers discovered that a group of suspected Chinese hackers had rigged a cluster of
servers in the basement of an administrative annex to quietly siphon surveillance videos from
across the AU’s sprawling campus in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.
The security breach was carried out by a Chinese hacking group nicknamed “Bronze
President,” according to a five-page internal memo reviewed by Reuters. It said the affected
cameras covered “AU offices, parking areas, corridors, and meeting rooms.”
“We cannot estimate the quantity and value of the data which have been stolen,” the memo
continued, adding that while AU technicians had managed to interrupt the flow of data, the
hackers could easily regain the upper hand.
“We are still weak to prevent another attack,” the memo said.
The alert, drafted in late January and circulated to senior officials, provides a glimpse of how
world powers are jockeying for influence and visibility at the continent’s paramount panAfrican organization. Some American and European officials have voiced concern as Beijing
has stepped in to meet the AU’s needs - part of an Africa-wide shift that has seen China
become the continent’s top creditor. Chinese workers built the AU’s showpiece new
conference center in 2012 and Chinese technicians still help maintain the organization’s
digital infrastructure.
The Chinese mission to the AU said in an email that “the AU side has not mentioned being
hacked on any occasion” and that Africa and China are “good friends, partners and
brothers.”
“We never interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and wouldn’t do anything that harms the
interests of the African side,” the email said.

Repeated messages sent to AU spokesperson Ebba Kalondo asking about the January
breach were marked as “read” but went unanswered.
Longstanding doubts over Beijing's role at the AU spilled into the open in 2018, when French
newspaper Le Monde reported here that AU employees had found that the servers at the
new conference center were sending copies of their contents to Shanghai every night and
that the building itself had been honeycombed with listening devices.
Both the AU and the Chinese government vehemently denied the report at the time, but a
former AU official told Reuters the article in Le Monde was accurate and had put officials
there on high alert over cyberespionage.

The former official said the latest breach was discovered following a tip from Japan’s
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), which in a Jan. 17 email alerted AU officials
to unusual traffic between the international organization’s network and a domain associated
with Bronze President.
Koichiro Komiyama, who directs the global coordination division of Japan’s CERT, confirmed
to Reuters that he sent the warning after a fellow researcher discovered the malicious traffic
while picking through the hacking group’s old infrastructure.
The AU memo said that, within days of Komiyama’s email, the AU’s information technology
team had traced the suspicious traffic to a set of servers in the basement of the
organization’s Building C - part of an older complex across the road from the new conference
center.
The memo said the hackers were able to siphon off “a huge volume of traffic” from the
servers by hiding it in the regular flow of data leaving the AU’s network during business
hours, even pausing their data theft during lunch.
Secureworks, an arm of Dell Technologies Inc which has been tracking Bronze President
since 2018, confirmed that the malicious domain identified by Japan’s CERT was linked to
the hackers.
Secureworks researcher Mark Osborn said his company had seen strong evidence that
Bronze President operated from China, adding that it had been detected in several
espionage campaigns targeting China’s neighbors, including Mongolia and India.
Any official protest over the spying is unlikely, according to the former AU official. He said
China plays a critical role in keeping the organization running, including during an incident in
June when part of the AU’s network was knocked out by a power failure and Chinese
technicians swiftly repaired the damage.
For that reason, the former official expects that the surveillance camera incident - like the
listening devices reported in 2018 - would be swept under the rug.
“Attacking the Chinese, for us, it’s a very bad idea,” he said.
