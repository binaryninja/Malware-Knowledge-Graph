Summary
At BitSight we do a lot of malware sinkholing, and by late 2021 we started registering some
DGA-like domains that not only did not belong to any known domain generation algorithm
(DGA) but were also being classified as different types of malware like SmokeLoader,
PrivateLoader, Socelars, and Redline. We registered more than 50 domains, all in the form
[a-jm-r]{10}.com, and started investigating what we thought could be an unknown malware
family.
In this post we'll go through a technical analysis of this unknown malware, describing how we
went from unknown DGA-like domains to sinkholing and emulating a fairly recent botnet that
in the last 8 months has infected nearly 500,000 machines (2.2M unique IPs) in total, across
at least 40 countries, and has a current estimated botnet size of around 50,000 machines.

Sample Discovery

1/13

The process of tracing back a domain to a specific malware sample that generates traffic can
vary; It can sometimes be as easy as opening the first result on a Google search for the
domain, or as annoying as going through multiple search engines and ending on a Wayback
Machine page that does not resolve. In this section we'll detail how we traced a sample for
this specific malware family, going from the domains and their traffic to a recent family
dubbed PseudoManuscrypt by Kaspersky.
We were confident that we had registered DGA domains given the pattern and traffic of the
domains. We also knew that the domains were generating UDP traffic on port 53 (Figure 1),
so we started by looking at communicating files from VirusTotal Intelligence (Figure 2) to get
a better sense of the infection chain and hopefully reach a sample that would communicate
with our sinkholes.

Figure 1
Our first impression was that there were a lot of files generating traffic to the DGA (Figure 2)
and that many were installers or archives that contained detections for multiple families,
explaining why our systems' classification was also reporting different families for the set of
domains.

Figure 2.
The large amount of bundled communicating files makes it harder to track down the exact
source of the traffic, so we went through some trial and error, sending multiple files to a
sandbox and searching both for traffic to the DGA domains, as well as the uncommon UDP
traffic on port 53. While going through the sandbox's runs we found this sample, which
contains UDP traffic on port 53 to toa.mygametoa[.]com. By searching for this domain on
Google, we found a fairly recent (by the time of the research) article from Kaspersky
mentioning a new malware family: PseudoManuscrypt.
The article's description of how PseudoManuscrypt is distributed and communicates with the
C2 matches what we were seeing, and it filled the gap for some of our unknowns: the
uncommon UDP traffic we were seeing was actually KCP over UDP, and the kill chain that
led to the communication was originating from a .dat and .dll file. Looking back at this
sample, we could see a call to rundll32.exe with a file ending in sqlite.dll. This file (together
with the .dat) was being downloaded by one of the bundled executables from
t.gogamec[.]com (Figure 3).

Figure 3.
The article gave us high confidence that we were seeing PseudoManuscrypt traffic to our
sinkholes. There was, however, no mention of any Domain Generation Algorithm within the
research.

Distribution and Execution Flow
In the previous section we found the malware family that was generating the traffic we were
observing, and we also identified one of the distribution methods. In this section we'll dig
further into the distribution and execution flow of PseudoManuscrypt, enabling us to easily
obtain recent samples of it, as well as giving us a starting point for a more in-depth analysis
of the communication protocol.
We already know based on Kaspersky's work that there are multiple distribution methods for
the PseudoManuscrypt family. For us it was obvious from the beginning that some of it is
done from within archive files containing many other malware families, like Socelars,
Smokeloader or Redline (hence our DGA domains being incorrectly classified), but during
some parallel work we had on PrivateLoader, we noticed samples that included a hardcoded
URL to fetch the main PseudoManuscrypt executable (Figure 4).

4/13

Figure 4.
We do not know the purpose of the hardcoded URL list that PrivateLoader has, since we
didn't see PrivateLoader samples fetching those URLs, but the presence of this URL hints at
the possibility of PrivateLoader distributing PseudoManuscrypt. At the time of writing the URL
redirected to another domain (b.dxyzgame[.]com) that wasn't resolving to any IP, but in the
past it was dropping this executable.
Both the previously mentioned executable and the executables bundled in the installers and
archives show signs of being a dropper for the PseudoManuscrypt family. Their behavior
coincides with Kaspersky's description as well as with what we've seen, where the
executable downloads 2 files from a domain that, as far as we've seen, always contains the
"game" keyword (check IOCs for domain list).
As for the files that are downloaded:
One is a packed data file, usually pointed by the URI /X/sqlite.dat or X.html where we
believe that X is the campaign number.
The other file is a 32-bit Windows library, pointed by the URI /sqlite.dll or login.html.
Most recent droppers write both files to %APPDATA%\Local\Temp with the names sqlite.dll
and sqlite.dat, and then run the following command:
rundll32.exe "C:\Users\X\AppData\Local\Temp\sqlite.dll",global

5/13

The "global" export will locate the file named sqlite.dat in the same directory, unpack it in
memory and then execute it (Figure 5). The unpacking algorithm includes a rolling XOR, and
a decompression routine. sqlite.dll runs the rolling XOR on sqlite.dat, and then jumps to the
beginning of it. The decrypted shellcode will then XOR and decompress a part of itself using
the LZNT1 algorithm. We've shared a Python script to unpack the .dat file here.

6/13

Figure 5.
This execution flow would suggest that the DLL that is downloaded simply behaves as the
unpacker for the packed core component. This claim is backed by the fact the unpacker DLL
is always identical, whereas the packed core changes frequently.
We close this section with a better understanding of the distribution and execution flow of this
family (Figure 6), and with easy access to the core component that will enable us to better
understand the communication protocol.

Figure 6.

Sample Analysis
In this section we'll detail some of the analysis we did on the core component of
PseudoManuscrypt. We won't detail every aspect of the sample, as our main focus was on
understanding the basics of the communication protocol to create a custom sinkhole.

Hardcoded C2s and DGAs
By this point we had access to PseudoManuscrypt's core component, and our hypothesis
was that there was a main (possibly hardcoded) C2 domain (toa.mygametoa[.]com) and a
fallback DGA that would trigger on specific conditions. To quickly test our hypothesis, we
manually ran the unpacker and the core, while also changing the hosts file to point
toa.mygametoa[.]com to 127.0.0.1. This triggered the DGA (Figure 7), confirming our
hypothesis.
7/13

Figure 7.
We then started looking at the core component itself to find and reverse the DGA. Just by
looking at the strings contained in the core, we were able to identify two hardcoded C2s:
toa.mygametoa[.]com
tob.mygametob[.]com
By looking for references to the hardcoded C2s, we identified that the client tries to connect
to the first one, if it is not able to communicate with it, the infected machine will fallback to the
DGA. As for the second hardcoded domain, our understanding is that it will be used only if
the C2 server instructs the client to use it.
The DGA uses the hardcoded C2 and a key as seeds. The algorithm is as follows (Figure 8):
1. The domain and key variables are concatenated with a ","
2. The string is MD5 hashed
3. 8 bytes are retrieved from the hash, starting at index 4 and ending at position 12
4. For the first 10 hexadecimal values of the retrieved bytes:
1. If it's a number, 0x31 is added (outputs "a" to "j")
2. If an uppercase letter, 0x2c is added (outputs "m" to "r")
5. ".com" is appended to the resulting string
For every call to the DGA algorithm, the previously generated domain is used as the first
argument, while the second argument is always the same string. This makes the domains
dependent on the previously generated domain, making a circular group of all possible
domains.
A Python implementation of this DGA is available here.

8/13

Figure 8.
The infected client will try to connect to each of the sequentially generated domains, and
everytime it fails it will generate a new one.
Given the circular characteristics of the DGA and the small size of the domains, we
generated all possible domains for both the hardcoded C2s. Here you can see a list with all
possible 585,723 unique domains for the toa.mygametoa[.]com C2, and here is a list with all
possible 812,811 unique domains for the tob.mygametob[.]com C2.
In order to collect infection telemetry from infected machines, we needed to implement the
protocol the malware uses.

Communication protocol
From Kaspersky's research and our own, we know that this family communicates using KCP
over UDP, and TCP as a fallback. The KCP protocol has been designed as a replacement for
TCP, and its specification can be found on GitHub. PseudoManuscrypt's code of KCP is very
similar to the linked repository, suggesting that they might be using that specific
implementation.
Although the communication protocol uses UDP port 53 and TCP port 443, they implement
their own messaging protocol. We focused on the first exchange between the client and the
server, which allowed us to map connections from the domains into infections, and also
extract a lot of information about the infected machines.
This custom protocol can be divided into 2 layers. The first layer (L1) contains the message
to be sent, while the second layer (L2) contains metadata about the message. Both layers
are independent of each other.

9/13

L2 has the following format:
Struct L2
{
BYTE header;
BYTE compression_type;
int32 L2_size;
int32 L1_size;
BYTE L1[L2_size - 10];
}

Where:
`header` byte is always 0x43
`compression_type` can be one of the following:
0x0F -> no compression, no encryption
0x1F -> no compression, L1 xored with 0x88
0x2F -> zlib compression, no encryption
0x3F -> zlib compression, then L1 xored with 0x88
0x4F -> RtlCompressBuffer compression, no encryption
0x5F -> RtlCompressBuffer compression then L1 xored with 0x88
`L2_size` is the size of L2, which contains both the metadata and the compressed L1
`L1_size` is the real size of L1
`L1` is an array with L1 content
The L1 format will vary based on the type of received message. We believe that the generic
format is the following:
Struct L1
{
BYTE message_type;
... varies based on message_type
}

First message
When the infected machine first communicates with the C2, it sends a lot of information
about the computer. In all samples we found, the `compression_type` was always 0x3F (zlib
compression, then 1-byte-xor with 0x88) for the L1 format. The following is what we believe
is the L1 format for this initial message:
struct L1_layer
{
BYTE message_type;
BYTE padding1[3];
int32 campaign;
10/13

char client_id[33];
BYTE padding2[3];
int32 major_winver;
int32 minor_winver;
int32 build_number;
int32 platform_id;
int32 is_intel_amd;
int32 is_running_wow64;
int32 winserv_version; // Not working (always 0)
int32 is_winserv;
BYTE padding3[256];
int16 number_of_proc;
BYTE padding4[2];
int32 proc_freq_mhz;
int32 mem_size_mb;
char hostname[50];
BYTE padding5[2];
int32 ms_needed_to_connect;
BYTE tbd2[100];
wchar client_release_date[9];
BYTE padding6[182];
wchar client_version[9];
BYTE padding7[22];
int32 has_a_camera;
char internal_ip_port[94];
int16 port;
int32 tickcount;
int32 pid;
int32 sz_firmware_table;
BYTE firmware_table[sz_firmware_table];
}

Most of the fields are self-explanatory, we'd just like to detail that:
`message_type` is 0x99 for this first message
`paddingX` fields are always null
`campaign` always matches the number that is seen in the URL from there the
sqlite.dat was downloaded from
`client_id` is the MD5 sum of the substructure containing the fields `sz_firmware_table`
and `firmware_table`
`client_release_date` and `client_version` are dates and are almost always the value,
with the exception that `client_version` has a `v` in the beginning.
First response

11/13

Once the server receives the first message, it can send various types of commands to
execute on the system, like: running a binary, clearing event logs, modifying registry keys,
etc. The C2 usually responds with a sleep command of 3600 seconds (`message_type`
0x00), unless the `client_version` field in the first message isn't the most recent one, and if
so the C2 replies with a "binary update" (`message_type` 0x01) command, and sends the
most recent version of PseudoManuscrypt's core.
We did not investigate the communication protocol any further, as at this point we had
enough information to be able to identify and sinkhole PseudoManuscrypt infections.

Conclusion
With the previous work we developed our own custom sinkhole for this family. We've been
tracking it for over 8 months, seeing a daily botnet size of around 16,000 machines until the
end of August, where a new version with a new C2 was pushed (consequently a new DGA)
and the daily numbers dropped to around 7k.
Roughly 5 days before the new version was pushed, we saw a sudden increase in infections
that peaked at around 51,500 unique client IDs (Figure 9). We hypothesize that the
hardcoded C2 could have had an issue, making the bots fallback to the DGA, and
consequently communicate with our sinkhole.

Figure 9.
As PseudoManuscrypt seems to be a recent, but fairly large botnet, in a future post we'll
detail some insights about the telemetry we're getting from sinkholing the DGA domains.
We'll also detail the botnet's evolution and its bots.
