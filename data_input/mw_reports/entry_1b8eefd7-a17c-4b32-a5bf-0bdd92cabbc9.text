Some notes on IoCs
blog.erratasec.com/2016/12/some-notes-on-iocs.html

Obama "sanctioned" Russia today for those DNC/election hacks, kicking out 35 diplomats
(**), closing diplomatic compounds (**), seizing assets of named individuals/groups (***).
They also published "IoCs" of those attacks, fingerprints/signatures that point back to the
attackers, like virus patterns, file hashes, and IP addresses.
These IoCs are of low quality. They are published as a political tool, to prove they have
evidence pointing to Russia. They have limited utility to defenders, or those publicly
analyzing attacks.
Consider the Yara rule included in US-CERT's "GRIZZLY STEPPE" announcement:

What is this? What does this mean? What do I do with this information?

1/3

It's a YARA rule. YARA is a tool ostensibly for malware researchers, to quickly classify files.
It's not really an anti-virus product designed to prevent or detect an intrusion/infection, but to
analyze an intrusion/infection afterward -- such as attributing the attack. Signatures like this
will identify a well-known file found on infected/hacked systems.
What this YARA rule detects is, as the name suggests, the "PAS TOOL WEB KIT", a web
shell tool that's popular among Russia/Ukraine hackers. If you google "PAS TOOL PHP WEB
KIT", the second result points to the tool in question. You can download a copy here [*], or
you can view it on GitHub here [*].
Once a hacker gets comfortable with a tool, they tend to keep using it. That implies the YARA
rule is useful at tracking the activity of that hacker, to see which other attacks they've been
involved in, since it will find the same web shell on all the victims.
The problem is that this P.A.S. web shell is popular, used by hundreds if not thousands of
hackers, mostly associated with Russia, but also throughout the rest of the world (judging by
hacker forum posts). This makes using the YARA signature for attribution problematic: just
because you found P.A.S. in two different places doesn't mean it's the same hacker.
A web shell, by the way, is one of the most common things hackers use once they've broken
into a server. It allows further hacking and exfiltration traffic to appear as normal web
requests. It typically consists of a script file (PHP, ASP, PERL, etc.) that forwards commands
to the local system. There are hundreds of popular web shells in use.
We have little visibility into how the government used these IoCs. IP addresses and YARA
rules like this are weak, insufficient for attribution by themselves. On the other hand, if
they've got web server logs from multiple victims where commands from those IP addresses
went to this specific web shell, then the attribution would be strong that all these attacks are
by the same actor.
In other words, these rules can be a reflection of the fact the government has excellent
information for attribution. Or, it could be a reflection that they've got only weak bits and
pieces. It's impossible for us outsiders to tell. IoCs/signatures are fetishized in the
cybersecurity community: they love the small rule, but they ignore the complexity and context
around the rules, often misunderstanding what's going on. (I've written thousands of the
things -- I'm constantly annoyed by the ignorance among those not understanding what they
mean).
I see on twitter people praising the government for releasing these IoCs. What I'm trying to
show here is that I'm not nearly as enthusiastic about their quality.

Note#1: BTW, the YARA rule has to trigger on the PHP statements, not on the imbedded

2/3

BASE64 encoded stuff. That's because it's encrypted with a password, so could be different
for every hacker.
Note#2: Yes, the hackers who use this tool can evade detection by minor changes that avoid
this YARA rule. But that's not a concern -- the point is to track the hacker using this tool
across many victims, to attribute attacks. The point is not to act as an anti-virus/intrusiondetection system that triggers on "signatures".
Note#3: Publishing the YARA rule burns it. The hackers it detects will presumably move to
different tools, like PASv4 instead of PASv3. Presumably, the FBI/NSA/etc. have a variety of
YARA rules for various web shells used by know active hackers, to attribute attacks to
various groups. They aren't publishing these because they want to avoid burning those rules.
Note#4: The PDF from the DHS has pretty diagrams about the attacks, but it doesn't appears
this web shell was used in any of them. It's difficult to see where it fits in the overall picture.

(**) No, not really. Apparently, kicking out the diplomats was punishment for something else,
not related to the DNC hacks. (***) It's not clear if these "sanctions" have any teeth.
