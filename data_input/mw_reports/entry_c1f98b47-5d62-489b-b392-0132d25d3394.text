ShadowPad: A successor to PlugX? (cont.)
▪

The relationship between ShadowPad and PlugX
Comparisons on their codes have been discussed[1]
– They share the same project name “SC” according to the PDB strings of their controllers

PlugX Controller: D:\My2014\SController(5.6)(天道)(匙)\SC\
ShadowPad Controller: X:\My2015\SC(1.1)\x64\Release\SoSvr.pdb

The alleged author of PlugX: whg
whg aka 无花果, based in the Sichuan province of China
▪ His nickname was found in some of the PlugX samples[2]:
▪

C:\Documents and Settings\whg\桌面\Plug\FastGui(LYT)\Shell\Release\Shell.pdb
– C:\Users\whg\Desktop\Plug\FastGui(LYT)\Shell\Release\Shell.pdb
–

▪

He had a solid track record of developing backdoors and hacking tools, while he claimed
to sell some “shared software”.
–

Also, he had deep connection with Rose,
one of the threat actors in APT41.

The business model
of ShadowPad

© 2021 SentinelOne. All Rights Reserved.

How flexible is the controller?
The plugins are place in a directory.
▪ In theory, you can upload any plugin within the
correct format.
▪

© 2021 SentinelOne. All Rights Reserved.

24

How flexible is the controller?
▪

… but the user cannot interact with
the plugins without an interface
The interfaces are hardcoded in the
controller
– No options to add a new interface
–

25

A piece of sold malware with extendibility
▪

ShadowPad is not extendible by the users except the original developer.
–

▪

Not originally designed as a framework.

The developer can remove a plugin from the package easily.
–

Just remove the plugins from the directory.

29

Selling the plugins separately (cont.)
▪

Most of the samples do not have utility plugins embedded in them.
Need to upload other plugins remotely through the controllers.
– The plugins are placed in the directory:
easy to be removed from a package
–

▪

Tick – an active user of ShadowPad – developed a tool with the same functionality of the
plugin “Software” in an overlapped timeframe.
–

▪

Tick did not have access to that plugin while it was already available

The plugins should be provided separately.
–

Not given in a full bundle.

30

The business model of ShadowPad
ShadowPad is a sold malware.
▪ The plugins need to be acquired separately.
▪ It is only sold to a limited set of users.
▪

▪

Why is ShadowPad a good choice for the attackers:
The cost to develop a stable backdoor/RAT is high.
– The plugins (functionalities) are complete, and the attackers can choose which they want.
–

•

–

ShadowPad was the primary backdoor for long-term espionage in several campaigns.

The use of a shared backdoor reduces the chance to be attributed.

Landscape shift

From developing backdoors to acquiring backdoors
▪

Past
–

▪

Chinese threat actors develop their own tool sets based on their needs during operations

Now
The popularity of malware such as ShadowPad and CobaltStrike among Chinese espionage
groups
– Here is an example about Tick's timeline of backdoor
–

© 2021 SentinelOne. All Rights Reserved.

42

The benfit of acquiring backdoors
▪

Lower the cost
Reduces the cost of a well-designed piece of malware
– Reduces the human resource to develop the malware in-house
–

▪

Keeps enhancing the stability and usability
The service provider will provide newest version of the backdoor with new features added
– Unlike much of the commodity malware found in cybercriminal circles or underground forums

Mitigation advice

© 2021 SentinelOne. All Rights Reserved.

Mitigation advice for ShadowPad
▪

Audit the services and the registries to find any suspicious items

▪

Monitor dynamic behaviors of “spawning a new process” and “process injection”

▪

Apply memory forensics periodically to identify malware which resides in-memory

▪

Adopt an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution across your organization

▪

A well consolidated monitoring capability provides visibility into cyber threats

Conclusion

© 2021 SentinelOne. All Rights Reserved.

Conclusion
▪

Why do the actors choose to use ShadowPad?
Experienced developers to develop something much better with active updates
– Reducing the cost of operation and development
– Harder for security company to do further research
–

▪

Why ShadowPad is not disappearing?
Still under updates with more advanced obfuscation and persistence techniques
– A powerful backdoor with more functionalities so good for long-term espionage operations and
keep stealthy under the radar
–

▪

How ShadowPad affect threat intelligence?
–

Need to develop more systematic ways for attribution
