Remove COSMICGALE rule
7e90a79
Please consider removing this Yara rule from the repo to reduce on-going industry
confusion. Based on my analysis, shared with FEYE pre-publication on 2020-12-10, this
unsigned SolarWinds "plugin" DLL may be abused maliciously - but that postexploitation activity and filewrites occur within inetpub in-the-wild and are more
indicative of web-facing exploitation with artifacts more similar to CVE-2019-8917.
As there is no tied to the software supply chain compromises, we are not currently
tracking this as the same threat actor - and my understanding is that FireEye is also
no longer tracking this as UNC2452. Since COSMICGALE is not referenced in the blog
with this delineation, it's probably better to remove entirely to reduce industry
confusion.
