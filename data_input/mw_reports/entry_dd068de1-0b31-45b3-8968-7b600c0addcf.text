Four months after the arrest of the suspected mastermind of the Carbanak cyber heist gang
in Spain, three more “high-ranking” members have been arrested, according to the US
Department of Justice (DoJ).
Since 2013, the cyber crime gang – also known as Fin7 and JokerStash – has attempted to
attack banks, e-payment systems and financial institutions using pieces of malware they
designed, known as Carbanak and Cobalt, and is linked to the theft of up to $1bn from
financial institutions worldwide.
The criminal operation has targeted banks in more than 40 countries and has resulted in
cumulative losses of more than €1bn for the financial industry, according to Europol, with the
Cobalt malware enabling criminals to steal up to €10m per heist.
The DoJ said the latest arrests involve three Ukrainian citizens linked to the theft of credit
and debit card records from restaurants, casinos and other businesses across the US, as
well as in the UK, France and Australia, with losses totalling tens of millions of dollars.
Dmytro Fedorov (44), Fedir Hladyr (33) and Andrii Kolpakov (30) face 26 charges that
include wire fraud, computer hacking and identity theft.
Hladyr, who was arrested in Germany in January, is in custody in Seattle, while Fedorov is
being held in Poland and Kolpakov is in Spain, both awaiting extradition to the US.
The group is believed to have hacked into thousands of computer systems and stolen
millions of customer credit and debit card numbers, which the group used or sold for profit
through criminal marketplaces on the dark web, the DoJ said in a statement.
In many cases, the gang is believed to have used cleverly crafted emails to trick employees
into activating an adapted version of the Carbanak malware and other tools to access and
steal payment card data.

According to the DoJ, the group – which is still believed to be active – stole more than 15
million payment card details from more than 6,500 payment check-out points in the US
alone.
“Protecting consumers and companies who use the internet to conduct business – both large
chains and small “mom and pop” stores – is a top priority for all of us in the Department of
Justice,” said US Attorney Annette Hayes.
“Cyber criminals who believe that they can hide in faraway countries and operate from
behind keyboards without getting caught are just plain wrong.
“We will continue our long-standing work with partners around the world to ensure cyber
criminals are identified and held to account for the harm that they do – both to our
pocketbooks and our ability to rely on the cyber networks we use,” she said.
The naming of the gang leaders marks a major step towards dismantling this sophisticated
criminal enterprise, said FBI special agent in charge Jay Tabb.
“As the lead federal agency for cyber attack investigations, the FBI will continue to work with
its law enforcement partners worldwide to pursue the members of this devious group, and
hold them accountable for stealing from American businesses and individuals,” he said.
Hladyr’s trial is currently scheduled for 22 October. No other trial dates have been set.
