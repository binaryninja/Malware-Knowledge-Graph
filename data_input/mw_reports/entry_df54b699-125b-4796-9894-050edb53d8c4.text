No, this will not be a skiddy Tutorial on how to earn quick crypto but rather an analysis of the
Open Source Ransomware "Hiddentear".

A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below
will lead to the encryption of your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check
with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources might be illegal depending
on where you live.

Because HiddenCrypt is Written in C# utilizing the .NET Framework 4 static analysis of the
Binary will happen in Progress Telerik JustDecompile and dnspy. With over 370 Forks and
about as many stars on Github at the time of writing this, Hiddentear is the arguably the most
popular open source Windows Ransomware on the platform.

The original Ransomnote that is dropped to the Desktop by Hiddentear:

It uses the RijndaelManaged class implemented in System.Security.Cryptography for the file
encryption routine (which is just a fancy way of saying, that victim data is encrypted with
AES-256-CBC :D).

By default Hidden Tear will only spare Folders named Windows, Program Files and Program
Files (x86) and encrypt the contents of every Directory that doesn't match this condition.

3/10

if (!directories[j].Contains("Windows") && !directories[j].Contains("Program Files")
&& !directories[j].Contains("Program Files (x86)"))
{
this.encryptDirectory(directories[j], password);
this.messageCreator(directories[j]);
}

Another common mechanism to disrupt detection and analysis is a self deletion routine. After
a timeout to ensure a completed execution it will just remove itself via the Del argument.
public void selfDestroy()
{
ProcessStartInfo processStartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo()
{
Arguments = string.Concat("/C timeout 2 && Del /Q /F ",
Application.ExecutablePath),
WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden,
CreateNoWindow = true,
FileName = "cmd.exe"
};
Process.Start(processStartInfo);
}

This sample was found on the IIS Webhost of the Mineral Resources Authority of Papua New
Guinea and tries to disguise as a Vodafone PDF Invoice.

Throwing the dropped binary into Detect it Easy returns the notice that it pretends to be a
WinRAR installer Version 5.x.

Extracting the strings out of the mentioned executable (with a relatively new fancy tool by
fireeye called stringsifter) one can see that actually includes three references related to
WinRAR, where the first is
D:\Projects\WinRAR\sfx\build\sfxrar32\Release\sfxrar.pdb . As for a TIL: sfx
stands for "self-extracting archive" which is packaged with an executable to extract it so it's
(more or less) independent from the hostsystem. Wikipedia's got you hooked up.
The full string dump can be had here. It also contains a number of messages in a foreign
language which are identified as turkish by Google Translate:

Loading the binary into JustDecompileIt we notice that it was crypted by something called
Aika.

The Assembly Information also gives away that ConfuserEx is involved as well. The payload
section confirms that hint as we have an encrypted payload that will be fetched in runtime
and then executed via RunPE.

Below you can see a screenshot of the Aika Crypter. As I already mentioned it is based on
ConfuserEx and includes the other run of the mill evasion techniques and Injections (RunPE
or self).

This sample also features an anti-debugging check via IsDebuggerPresent. Nothing we
haven't seen before either. (▀Ĺ▀ ̿)

Open Source Ransomware (Malware)?
The main reason why projects like Hidden Tear exist is to use it as a training model and PoC
to handle "real" ransomware more efficiently. Critics say that OSS Malware will never match
real threats - which is definitely true to some extent - and that it only promotes building
weaponized versions of it. On the other hand OSS ransomware is very useful to get a true
baseline reading from a sandbox system since you know for sure what it will do next. So
what should you think about it know? If you ask me the bad outweighs the good here: Per
day multiple new weaponized versions of Hidden Tear hit AnyRun, VT and Co. that are
packed/obfuscated or modified with numerous evasion techniques. If it shows us one thing
it's that building ransomware isn't hard. Even worse: it is not like ransomware is a dual use
tool (like e.g. a hammer). Nobody will call you out for build a PoC binary to better understand
the inner workings and how to analyse it afterwards. Don't get me wrong: I'm a HUGE
advocate of open source software, but please don't push your "Proof of Concepts" to Github
if they can literally be turned into malware by exchanging a URL and Bitcoin address.
