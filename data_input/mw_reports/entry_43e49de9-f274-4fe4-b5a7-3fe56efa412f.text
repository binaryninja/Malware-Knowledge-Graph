June 11, 2021

The criminal group behind the Avaddon ransomware has shut down its operation
today and released decryption keys for past victims.
The keys were made available earlier today via a private message sent to Bleeping
Computer, a ransomware support forum and news site that has been covering the
ransomware scene since 2016.
The keys have now been shared with Emsisoft, a security firm that has previously released
tens of free decryption utilities for all kinds of ransomware strains.
The company expects to release a free decryptor over the weekend, Emsisoft security
researcher Michael Gillespie has told The Record in an interview. [Update: Decryptor now
live here.]
The decryptor will take the 2,934 decryption keys and allow past Avaddon victims to decrypt
their files for free if they still have the encrypted files around and have not deleted the data.

PSA: Avaddon appears to have shut down and released 2934 private keys of victims.
A public Emsisoft decryption tool is coming soon. Do not pay. If you are a victim and
want to know if your files can be decrypted, please reach out to [email protected]
Thanks.

Avaddon was slowly becoming a top-tier threat
The Avaddon shutdown today came out of the blue and has surprised the security research
community.
After the disappearance of the Darkside ransomware gang in the aftermath of the Colonial
Pipeline attack, the Avaddon gang had moved very aggressively to fill the gap left on the
market, Allan Liska, a Recorded Future security analyst who tracks ransomware operations,
told The Record.
“Avaddon was tied with Conti for most number of ransomware extortions published since the
Colonial Pipeline attack,” Liska told us. “Fifty-nine victims published since May 7th ), 182 in
total since launching in August 2020.”

Furthermore, the group had also been extremely active even before the Colonial Pipeline
attack.
Tens of victims reported intrusions and submitting Avaddon-encrypted files and ransom
notes to the ID-Ransomware service on an almost weekly basis this year.

Avaddon’s recent sudden spike in attacks also led the US Federal Bureau of Investigation
and the Australian Cyber Security Centre to issue alerts at the start of May about their evergrowing number of intrusions.

Actual shutdown or just rebranding?
However, earlier today, the gang shut down its servers, its dark web leak site, wiped profiles
on hacking forums, and then sent the decryption keys to Bleeping Computer.

Avaddon ransomware leak site
Unlike other ransomware gangs who shut down operations through pompous messages
posted online, the Avaddon gang appears to have disappeared from the face of the earth.
Messages to a now-wiped hacking forum account were not returned. All posts made from
that account have also been deleted.
A theory gaining ground in the infosec community suggests that the group may be entering a
rebranding phase, something that many other gangs have done before, such as Nemty-toNefilim and Gandcrab-to-REvil.
Shortly after the Colonial Pipeline attack, the Avaddon gang also announced plans to go
private and work only with a selected number of affiliates for their intrusions.
Rebranding and going private would be a good way for the Avaddon gang to lose the law
enforcement agencies and security firms currently tracking its every moves.

Prior to shutting down, the Avaddon gang was also notorious for running one of the most
professional and responsive Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operations.

The group advertised through hacking forums such as Exploit and XSS, was responsive to
customer demands, and ran an automated leak portal as a double-extortion scheme for
victims who refused to pay.
In addition, the Avaddon gang also built one of the easier to use RaaS portals (see image
below, courtesy of the Recorded Future Insikt Group), and when a bug was found in its code
that allowed for free decryptions, they fixed it within a day.
