Introduction
At the end of October, a person deeply involved in the pro-democracy side of the Hong Kong
protests received a spear phishing email from someone claiming to be a law student at a top
foreign university, requesting for feedback on his supposed thesis which includes
recommendations on how to end the Hong Kong unrest. The email contained a link to a Google
drive ZIP ﬁle.

The contents of FYI.zip downloaded from the Google Drive link

The ZIP archive contained three ﬁles – an August 2019 policy brief downloaded from Freedom
House regarding the Democratic Crisis in Hong Kong, a September 2019 Hong Kong report
downloaded from Human Rights First, and a supposed RTF ﬁle from the Nikkei Asian Review.

Public document from Human Rights First

The third ﬁle masquerading as a Nikkei Asian Review document is actually a LNK shortcut ﬁle
which had a double extension. When LNK ﬁles are viewed through archiving software, the double
extension “.rtf.lnk” will be shown correctly. If the ﬁle was extracted and viewed through the
Windows Explorer, however, the operating system always hides the LNK extension by default.

Analysis of the LNK ﬁle shows running it will execute msiexec.exe to download and run a remote MSI ﬁle

The LNK ﬁle is actually a shortcut to the Windows utility msiexec.exe, which can be used as a
LOLBin to remotely download and run MSI ﬁles which have the PNG extension. In this case, the
MSI ﬁle is remotely downloaded from a GitHub repository and account which was created on
October 10.

A snapshot of the GitHub repository on October 29

siHost64
The MSI ﬁle, “siHost64.png”, was created using a registered or cracked EXEMSI program.
Running it will drop and run “siHost64.exe” in the %APPDATA% folder. This executable is a
PyInstaller executable which has over a thousand ﬁles inside it, but the main important ﬁle is the
compiled python script “siHost64”.

Unpacking the PyInstaller executable shows the real ﬁles, some of which cannot be seen when performing
dynamic analysis

By restoring the ﬁrst eight missing bytes of “siHost64” which is typically required for such
PyInstaller ﬁles, we are then able to decompile the compiled python script and analyze the
functionality of this malware:
Use the Python requests library to call the DropBox API which connects to DropBox and
uses it as a HTTPS C2 server
Use the system proxy for communications if any
Add itself to the registry AutoRun location
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run with the registry name “siHost64”.
On October 31, the new version of the malware changed the registry name used to
“Dropbox Update Setup”.
Perform AES encryption with CBC mode on uploaded ﬁles with the key
“ApmcJue1570368JnxBdGetr*^#ajLsOw” and a random salt
Check in to the C2 server by creating an encrypted ﬁle containing the operating system
version and architecture, date, computer name, and logged in user
Check for ﬁles from the C2 server which contain encrypted arbitrary commands to be run,
execute that command, and create a new encrypted ﬁle containing the results of the
executed command.

Example of the malware using the Dropbox API to check in

Based on the check in information from infected machines, it appears that there is a single
infected Hong Kong victim of interest to this threat actor connecting to the Dropbox app besides
the target we described at the start. The ﬁles exﬁltrated from this victim appeared to be personal
documents related to the victim traveling to the United States, business forms, and Christian
hymns.
Besides those exﬁltrated documents, the C2 server also appeared to host their next stage
malware such as two ﬁles named “GetCurrentRollback.exe” and “GetCurrentDeploy.dll”.
“GetCurrentRollback.exe” is a signed Microsoft executable which seems to be for upgrading the
previous Windows operating system version to Windows 10, and “GetCurrentDeploy.dll” likely
being the name of the DLL which is side loaded. The ﬁrst version of “GetCurrentRollback.exe” we
could ﬁnd was since 2016 and the latest in 2019 November, which means all version might be
exploitable by DLL Sideloading at ﬁrst glance.

A version of GetCurrentRollback.exe signed on November 13, 2019 is still vulnerable to DLL Sideloading

Conclusion
Based on the victim proﬁle and the exﬁltrated ﬁles, it appears one of the intelligence requirements
of the threat actor is to monitor people with relations to the Hong Kong protests, targeting either
them or the people around them. There are multiple possibilities for this requirements, with the
most likely being to understand the inner thoughts of pro-democracy movement, or to support or
undermine the movement behind the scenes.
Using Dropbox and other legitimate services such as Google Drive and GitHub
throughout the attack life cycle is not a new concept for threat actors, allowing them to easily
bypass network detection. To counter this threat, enterprises or teams within enterprises
nowadays block or detect such Shadow IT services if they are not in ofﬁcial use, but individual or
non-enterprise users which may be targeted by state sponsored threat actors rarely have this
luxury.

recommendations is available to existing NSHC ThreatRecon customers. For more information,
