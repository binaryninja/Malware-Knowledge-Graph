North Korean Defectors and Journalists Targeted
Using Social Networks and KakaoTalk
By Jaewon Min (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/author/jaewon-min/) on Jan 11, 2018

Recently, South Korean media wrote about North Korean refugees (http://www.newdaily.co.kr/news/article.html?
no=362555) and journalists (http://www.dailynk.com/korean/m/read.php?cataId=nk00400&num=111620) being targeted
by unknown actors using KakaoTalk (a popular chat app in South Korea) and other social network services (such as
Facebook) to send links to install malware on victims’ devices. This method shows that attackers are always looking for
di erent ways to deliver malware.
The McAfee Mobile Research Team has acquired malicious APK les that were used in the targeted attacks. According to
the articles, Google-shortened URLs were used to spread malware. We analyzed those statistics.

There are two versions of the dropper malware: “
” (Pray for North Korea) and “BloodAssistant” (a health care app).
In both cases, most clicks originated in South Korea and the most common browser and operating system combination
was Chrome and Windows. (Android was the second most common.) The referrers diagram of BloodAssistant shows
Facebook was used in 12% of cases to send the link to its targets.
In the case of the journalist who was targeted, the attacker sent a shortened link showing a thumbnail of another story
written by the journalist, according to the news article. The link directs to ihoodtec[.]com/upload/newslist[.]php (now
o ine), which seems to be used for redirecting to links in other domains. This shortened URL was clicked by someone with
an account at mail[.]police[.]go[.]kr, suggesting the shortened URL was also sent via email to the police address.

The number of clicks might not be meaningful because it can include access from malware researchers, but what is
meaningful is that malware-download links were spread using di erent platforms: Facebook, KakaoTalk, email, etc.

Analysis

Dropper
All the malicious APK les (including additional variants) dropped the Trojan on the victim’s device. Although the apps look
di erent, the dropper mechanism is identical. The following screens show the execution of the dropper les.

Figure 1: Screenshots of droppers.
When the dropper APK executes, it rst checks whether the device is already infected. If not infected, it phishes the victim
to turn on the accessibility permission. If the victim clicks the pop-up window, the view changes to the accessibility settings
menu so the app can acquire the permission.
When the accessibility service starts, it overlays the window (by playing a video, for example) to hide the process of turning
on required settings and dropping and installing the Trojan. The overlay is removed after the Trojan is installed. The
following diagram explains the ow after executing the dropper malware.

Figure 2: Execution ow of the dropper.
Trojan
The dropped Trojan uses popular cloud services Dropbox and Yandex as a control server to upload data and receive
commands. The following diagram explains the execution ow of the Trojan. The names of broadcast receivers and
services (with some misspellings) may vary between samples but the execution is the same.

Figure 3: Execution ow of the Trojan.
When the dropped Trojan is installed, it saves device information in a temporary folder and uploads it to the cloud. It then
downloads a le containing commands and other data to control the infected device. (We’ll explain the format of the
downloaded le in the next section.) Most of the malicious behaviors—such as saving SMS, contact information, etc.—are
implemented inside a separate dex le “core,” which is downloaded from the control server. This dex le is referenced in
many places in the malware. The malicious functionality can be extended, as we’ll explain in the following section.

Command le structure
The command le has its own format. The following diagram explains the types of values. O set designators are used to
retrieve each value when parsing the le. The next table explains each value.

Figure 4: Command le format.

Figure 5: Command le values.
The handler for command code received from the cloud (CMD value) is implemented as a separate dex le and is
downloaded either before or after the malware parses the command le. This mechanism allows the attacker to easily
extend its malicious functionality without needing to update the whole malware.
Our analysis shows that only some of the commands are implemented now and uploaded to the cloud control server.
Note Command 12 captures KakaoTalk chat logs.

Variants
We have found variants of the APKs that news articles initially reported on Google Drive. (The APKs on Google Drive are
marked as malware and cannot be downloaded.) Some variants use di erent cloud services as their control servers while
others drop the separate call-recording app “com.toh.callrecord” (assets/bbb). The following graph shows the relationships
among variants and dropped les.

Figure 7: Relationships among variants.

The Actors
Initial malicious APKs we found were uploaded to Google Drive by the same account, and we found a connected social
network account. By following activities of this account, we conclude with high con dence that this account was used to
send shortened URLs to victims to get them to download malicious APK les.
The group behind this campaign is certainly familiar with South Korean culture, TV shows, drama, and the language
because the account names associated with the cloud services are from Korean drama and TV shows, including the
following:

피형” (“blood type”), which is not used in South Korea but is used in North Korea.

We found the use of an interesting word, “

혈액형

(“
” is the word for blood type in South Korea.) We also found a North Korean IP address in test log les of some
Android devices that are connected to accounts used to spread the malware. However, Wi-Fi was on so we cannot exclude
the possibility that the IP address is private.
By looking at the list of deleted folders in the cloud, we found one with the name “sun Team Folder,” possibly the name of
the actors. This group has been active since 2016, according to the cloud storage creation date.

Conclusion
This malware campaign is highly targeted, using social network services and KakaoTalk to directly approach targets and
implant spyware. We cannot con rm who is behind this campaign, and the possible actor Sun Team is not related to any
previously known cybercrime groups. The actors are familiar with South Korea and appear to want to spy on North Korean
defectors, and on groups and individuals who help defectors.
McAfee Mobile Security detects this malware as Android/HiddenApp.BP. Always keep your mobile security application
updated to the latest version, and never install applications from unveri ed sources. We recommend installing KakaoTalk
only from Google Play. These habits will reduce the risk of infection by malware.
