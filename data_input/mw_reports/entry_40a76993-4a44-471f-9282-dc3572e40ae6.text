tl;dr
NCC Group’s Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) have responded to several extortion
cases recently involving the threat actor Karakurt.
During these investigations NCC Group CIRT have identified some key indicators that the
threat actor has breached an environment and we are sharing this intelligence to assist the
cyber defense security community.

1/4

It is thought that there may be a small window to respond to an undetected Karakurt breach
prior to data exfiltration taking place and we strongly urge any organisations that use single
factor Fortinet VPN access to use the information from the detection section of this blog to
identify if they may have been breached.

Initial Access
In all cases investigated, Karakurt have targeted single factor Fortigate Virtual Private
Network (VPN) servers.
It was observed that access was made using legitimate Active Directory credentials for the
victim environment.
The typical Dwell time (Time from threat actor access to detection) has been in the region of
just over a month, in part due to the fact the group do not encrypt their victims and use “living
off the land” techniques to remain undetected by not utilising anything recognised as
malware.
It is not clear how these credentials have been obtained at this stage with the VPN servers in
question not being vulnerable to the high profile Fortigate vulnerabilities that have had
attention over the past couple of years.
NCC Group strongly recommends that any organisation utilising single factor authentication
on a Fortigate VPN to search for the indicators of compromise detailed at the conclusion of
this blog.

Privilege Escalation
Karakurt have obtained access to domain administrator level privileges in all of the
investigated cases, but the privilege escalation method has not yet been accurately
determined.
In one case, attempts to exploit CVE-2020-1472, also known as Zerologon, were detected by
security software. The actual environment was not vulnerable to Zerologon however
indicating Karakurt may be attempting to exploit a number of vulnerabilities as part of their
operation.

Lateral Movement
Karakurt have then been seen to move laterally onto the primary domain controller of their
victim’s using the Sysinternals tool PsExec which provides a multitude of remote
functionality.
Karakurt have also utilised Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move around victim
environments.

Discovery
Once Karakurt obtain access to the primary domain controller they conduct a number of
discovery actions, enumerating information about the domain controller itself as well as the
wider domain.
One particular technique involves creating a DNS Zone export via an Encoded PowerShell
command.
This command leaves a series of indicators in the Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service
Event Log in the form of Event ID 3150, DNS_EVENT_ZONE_WRITE_COMPLETED.
This log is interesting as an indicator as it was present in all Karakurt engagements
investigated by NCC Group CIRT and in all cases the only occurrence of these events were
caused when Karakurt performed the zone exports. This was conducted very early in the
breach just after initial access and prior to data exfiltration occurring, which was typically two
weeks from initial access.
This action is also accompanied by extraction of the NTDS.dit file, believed to be utilised by
Karakurt to obtain further credentials as a means of persistence in the environment should
the account they initially gained access with be disabled.
This is evident through the presence of logs showing the volume shadow service being
utilised.
NCC Group CIRT strongly recommends that any organisation using single factor Fortinet
VPN access checks their domain controllers Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server logs for
evidence of Event ID 3150. If this is present at any point since December then it may well be
an indicator of a breach by Karakurt.

Data Staging
Once the discovery actions have been completed Karakurt appeared to leave the
environment before re-entering and identifying servers with access to sensitive victim data
on file shares. Once such a server is identified a secondary persistence mechanism was
utilised in the form of the remote desktop software AnyDesk allowing Karakurt access even if
the VPN access was removed.
On the same server that AnyDesk is installed Karakurt have been identified browsing folders
local to the server and on file shares.
7-Zip archives have then been created on the server.

3/4

In the cases investigated there were no firewall logs or other evidence to confirm the data
was then exfiltrated but based on the claims from Karakurt along with the file tree text file
provided as proof, it is strongly believed that the data was exfiltrated in all cases
investigated.
It is suspected that Karakurt are utilising Rclone to exfiltrate data to cloud data hosting
providers. This technique was discussed in a previous NCC Group blog, Detecting Rclone –
An Effective Tool for Exfiltration

Mitigations
To remove the threat immediately multi-factor authentication should be implemented for
VPN access using a Fortinet VPN.
Ensure all Domain Controllers are fully patched and patch for critical vulnerabilities
generally.

Detection
Look for evidence of the hosts authenticating from the VPN pool with the naming
convention used as default for Windows hosts, for example DESKTOP-XXXXXX.
Check for event log 3150 in the Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service Event Log.
Check for unauthorised use of AnyDesk or PsExec in the environment.
