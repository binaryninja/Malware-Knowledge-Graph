We recently became aware of customer reports advising that Avast antivirus was missing from their
systems – like the following example from Reddit.

From Reddit
We looked into this report and others like it and have found a new malware we’re calling
“Crackonosh” in part because of some possible indications that the malware author may be Czech.
Crackonosh is distributed along with illegal, cracked copies of popular software and searches for
and disables many popular antivirus programs as part of its anti-detection and anti-forensics tactics.
In this posting we analyze Crackonosh. We look first at how Crackonosh is installed. In our analysis
we found that it drops three key files winrmsrv.exe , winscomrssrv.dll and winlogui.exe
which we analyze below. We also include information on the steps it takes to disable Windows
1/25

Defender and Windows Update as well as anti-detection and anti-forensics actions. We include
information on how to remove Crackonosh. Finally, we include indicators of compromise for
Crackonosh.

Number of hits since December 2020. In total over 222,000 unique devices.

Number of users infected by Crackonosh since December 2020. In May it is still about a thousand
hits every day.
The main target of Crackonosh was the installation of the coinminer XMRig, from all the wallets we
found, there was one where we were able to find statistics. The pool sites showed payments of
9000 XMR in total, that is with today prices over $2,000,000 USD .

Installation of Crackonosh
The diagram below depicts the entire Crackonosh installation process.

Diagram of installation
1. First, the victim runs the installer for the cracked software.
2. The installer runs maintenance.vbs
3. Maintenance.vbs then starts the installation using serviceinstaller.msi

3/25

4. Serviceinstaller.msi registers and runs serviceinstaller.exe , the main malware
executable.
5. Serviceintaller.exe drops StartupCheckLibrary.DLL .
6. StartupCheckLibrary.DLL downloads and runs wksprtcli.dll .
7. Wksprtcli.dll extracts newer winlogui.exe and drops winscomrssrv.dll and
winrmsrv.exe which it contains, decrypts and places in the folder.
From the original compilation date of Crackonosh we identified 30 different versions
of serviceinstaller.exe , the main malware executable, from 31.1.2018 up to 23.11.2020. It is
easy to find out that serviceinstaller.exe is started from a registry key created by
Maintenance.vbs .
The only clue to what happened before the Maintenance.vbs creates this registry key and how
the files appear on the computer of the victim is the removal of InstallWinSAT task in
maintenance.vbs . Hunting led us to uncover uninstallation logs containing Crackonosh
unpacking details when installed with cracked software.
The following strings were found in uninstallation logs:
{sys}\7z.exe
-ir!*.*? e -pflk45DFTBplsd -y "{app}\base_cfg3.scs" -o{sys}
-ir!*.*? e -pflk45DFTBplsd -y "{app}\base_cfg4.scs" o{localappdata}\Programs\Common
/Create /SC ONLOGON /TN "Microsoft\Windows\Maintenance\InstallWinSAT" /TR
Maintenance.vbs /RL HIGHEST /F
/Create /SC ONLOGON /TN "Microsoft\Windows\Application
Experience\StartupCheckLibrary" /TR StartupCheck.vbs /RL HIGHEST /F

This shows us that Crackonosh was packed in a password protected archive and unpacked in the
process of installation. Here are infected installers we found:

Infected installers
The installer Inno Setup executes the following script. If it finds it’s “safe” to run malware, then
installs the Crackonosh malware to %SystemRoot%\system32\ and one configuration file to
%localappdata%\Programs\Common and creates in the Windows Task scheduler the tasks
InstallWinSAT to start maintenance.vbs and StartupCheckLibrary to start
StartupcheckLibrary.vbs . Otherwise it does nothing at all.

Analysis of Maintenance.vbs
As noted before, the Crackonosh installer registerers the maintenance.vbs script with the
Windows Task Manager and sets it to run on system startup. The Maintenance.vbs creates a
counter, that counts system startups until it reaches the 7th or 10th system start, depending on the
version. After that the Maintenance.vbs runs serviceinstaller.msi , disables hibernation
mode on the infected system and sets the system to boot to safe mode on the next restart. To cover
its tracks it also deletes serviceinstaller.msi and maintenance.vbs .
Below is the maintenance.vbs script:

Maintenance.vbs
Serviceinstaller.msi does not manipulate any files on the system, it only modifies the registry

to register serviceinstaller.exe , the main malware executable, as a service and allows it to
run in safe mode. Below you can see the registry entries serviceinstaller.msi makes.

Using Safe Mode to Disable Windows Defender and Antivirus
While the Windows system is in safe mode antivirus software doesn’t work. This can enable the
malicious Serviceinstaller.exe to easily disable and delete Windows Defender. It also uses
WQL to query all antivirus software installed SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct . If it finds any of
the following antivirus products it deletes them with rd <AV directory> /s /q command where
<AV directory> is the default directory name the specific antivirus product uses.
Adaware
Bitdefender
Escan
F-secure
Kaspersky
Mcafee (scanner only)
Norton
Panda
It has names of folders, where they are installed and finally it deletes %PUBLIC%\Desktop\ .
Older versions of serviceinstaller.exe used pathToSignedProductExe to obtain the
containing folder. This folder was then deleted. This way Crackonosh could delete older versions of
Avast or current versions with Self-Defense turned off.
It also drops StartupCheckLibrary.dll and winlogui.exe to %SystemRoot%\system32\
folder.
In older versions of serviceinstaller.exe it drops windfn.exe which is responsible for
dropping and executing winlogui.exe . Winlogui.exe contains coinminer XMRig and in newer
versions the serviceinstaller drops winlogui and creates the following registry entry:

This connects the infected PC to the mining pool on every start.

Disabling Windows Defender and Windows Update
It deletes following registry entries to stop Windows Defender and turn off automatic updates.

In the place of Windows Defender it installs its own MSASCuiL.exe which puts the icon of
Windows Security to the system tray.

Searching for Configuration Files
Looking at winrmsrv.exe
( aaf2770f78a3d3ec237ca14e0cb20f4a05273ead04169342ddb989431c537e83 ) behavior showed
something interesting in its API calls. There were over a thousand calls of FindFirstFileExW and
FindNextFileExW . We looked at what file it was looking for, unfortunately the author of malware
hid the name of the file behind an SHA256 hash as shown below.

In this image, you see the function

readability.
This technique was used in other parts of Crackonosh, sometimes with SHA1.
Here is a list of searched hashes and corresponding names and paths. In the case of
UserAccountControlSettingsDevice.dat the search is also done recursively in all subfolders.

These files contain configuration information encrypted with xor cipher with the keys in
executables.
After decryption we found names of other parts of malware, some URLs, RSA public keys,
communication keys for winrmsrv.exe and commands for XMRig. RSA keys are 8192 and 8912
bits long. These keys are used to verify every file downloaded by Crackonosh (via
StartupCheckLibrary.dll , winrmsrv.exe , winscomrssrv.dll ).
Here we found the first remark of wksprtcli.dll .

StartupCheckLibrary.dll and Download of wksprtcli.dll
StartupCheckLibrary.dll is the way how the author of Crackonosh can download updates of

Crackonosh on infected machines. Startupchecklibrary.dll queries TXT DNS records for
domains first[.]universalwebsolutions[.]info and
second[.]universalwebsolutions[.]info (or other TLDs like
getnewupdatesdownload[.]net and webpublicservices[.]org ). There are TXT DNS
records like ajdbficadbbfC@@@FEpHw7Hn33 . From the first twelve letters it computes the IP
address as shown on image. Next five characters are the digits of the port encrypted by adding 16.
This gives us a socket, where to download wksprtcli.dll. The last eight characters are the version.
Downloaded data is validated against one of the Public keys stored in the config file.

11/25

Decryption of IP address, screenshot from Ida
Wksprtcli.dll (exports DllGetClassObjectMain ) is updating older versions of Crackonosh.
The oldest version of wksprtcli.dll that we found checks only the nonexistence of
winlogui.exe . Then it deletes diskdriver.exe (previous coinminer) and autostart registry
entry. The newest version has a time frame when it runs. It deletes older versions of
winlogui.exe or diskdriver.exe and drops new version of winlogui.exe . It drops new
config files and installs winrmsrv.exe and winscomrssrv.dll . It also changed the way of
starting winlogui.exe from registry
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run to a task scheduled on user login.

Tasks created in Windows task scheduler by wksprtcli.dll
In the end it disallows hibernation and Windows Defender.
Wksprtcli.dll also checks computer time. The reason may be not to overwrite newer versions

and to make dynamic analysis harder. It also has written date after which it to stop winlogui task to
be able to replace files.

Analysis of Winrmsrv.exe
12/25

Winrmsrv.exe is responsible for P2P connection of infected machines. It exchanges version info

and it is able to download newer versions of Crackonosh. We didn’t find any evidence of versions
higher than 0 and therefore we don’t know what files are transferred.
Winrmsrv.exe searches for internet connection. If it succeeds it derives three different ports in the

following ways.
First, in the config file, there is offset (49863) and range (33575) defined. For every port there is
computed SHA-256 from date (days from Unix Epoch time) and 10 B from config file. Every port is
then set as offset plus the first word of SHA moduled by range (offset + (2 B of SHA % range)).
First two ports are used for incoming TCP connections. The last one is used to listen to an incoming
UDP.

13/25

Obtain ports, screenshot from IDA
Next, winrmsrv.exe starts sending UDP packets containing version and timestamp to random IP
addresses to the third port (approximately 10 IP’s per second). Packet is prolonged with random
bytes (to random length) and encrypted with a Vigenère cipher.

14/25

UDP packet
Finally, if winrmsrv.exe finds an IP address infected with Crackonosh, it stores the IP, control
version and starts updating the older one with the newer one. The update data is signed with the
private key. On the next start winrmsrv.exe connects all stored IP’s to check the version before
trying new ones. It blocks all IP addresses after the communication. It blocks them for 4 hours
unless they didn’t follow the protocol, then the block is permanent (until restart).
We have modified masscan to check this protocol. It showed about 370 infected IP addresses over
the internet (IPv4).

Encryption scheme of the TCP Packet
It’s notable that here is a mistake in TCP encryption/decryption implementation shown above.
Instead of the red arrow there is computed one more SHA256, that should be used in the xor with
the initialization vector. But then there is the source of the SHA used instead of the result.

Analysis of winscomrssrv.dll
It is preparation for the next phase. It uses the TXT DNS records the same way as
StratupCheckLibrary.dll . It tries to decode txt records on URL’s:

C:\WINDOWS\System32\winuptddm0 .

Anti-Detection and Anti-Forensics
As noted before, Crackonosh takes specific actions to evade security software and analysis.
Specific actions it takes to evade and disable security software includes:
Deleting antivirus software in safe mode
Stopping Windows Update
18/25

Replacing Windows Security with green tick system tray icon
Using libraries that don’t use the usual DllMain that is used when running library as the
main executable (by rundll32.exe ) but instead are started with some other exported
functions.
Serviceinstaller tests if it is running in Safe mode
To protect against analysis, it takes the following actions to test to determine if it’s running in a VM:
Checks registry keys:
SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Virtual Machine\Guest\Parameters
SOFTWARE\Oracle\VirtualBox Guest Additions

Test if computer time is in some reasonable interval e.g. after creation of malware and before
2023 ( wksprtcli.dll )
Also, as noted it delays running to better hide itself. We found the specific installers used hard
coded dates and times for its delay as shown below.

Hardcoded timestamps in installers
We also found a version, Winrmsrv.exe
( 5B85CEB558BAADED794E4DB8B8279E2AC42405896B143A63F8A334E6C6BBA3FB ), that instead

current system time is lower than the extracted value, winrmsrv.exe doesn’t run.
It also takes specific actions to hide itself from possible power users who use tools that could
disclose its presence.
It uses Windows-like names and descriptions such as winlogui.exe which is the Windows Logon
GUI Application.
It also checks running processes and compares it to the blocklist below. If it finds process with

Winlogui.dat , wslogon???.dat : temporary files to be moved as new winlogui.exe .
Perfdish001.dat : a list of infected IP addresses winrmsrv.exe found.
Install.msi and Install.vbs : these are in some versions a step between
maintenance.vbs and serviceinstaller.msi , containing commands that are otherwise
in maintenance.vbs .

Error messages
On infected machines, sometimes the following error messages about the file Maintenance.vbs
can appear.

Type Mismatch: ‘CInt’, Code: 800A000D

Can not find script file

Both of these are bugs in the Crackonosh installation.
Although there are some guides on the internet on how to resolve these errors, instead we
recommend following the steps in the previous chapter to be sure you fully remove all traces of
Crackonosh.

Conclusion
Crackonosh installs itself by replacing critical Windows system files and abusing the Windows Safe
mode to impair system defenses.
23/25

This malware further protects itself by disabling security software, operating system updates and
employs other anti-analysis techniques to prevent discovery, making it very difficult to detect and
remove.
In summary, Crackonosh shows the risks in downloading cracked software and demonstrates that it
is highly profitable for attackers. Crackonosh has been circulating since at least June 2018 and
has yielded over $2,000,000 USD for its authors in Monero from over 222,000 infected
systems worldwide.
As long as people continue to download cracked software, attacks like these will continue to be
profitable for attackers. The key take-away from this is that you really can’t get something for
nothing and when you try to steal software, odds are someone is trying to steal from you.
