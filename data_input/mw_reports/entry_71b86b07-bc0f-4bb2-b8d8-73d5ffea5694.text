Description
This tool is designed to identify processes, services, and drivers that SUNBURST attempts
to identify on the victim's machine.
This tool leverages the same logic SUNBURST uses to obtain a list of running
processes/services/drivers, then applies the same hashing algorithm, and performs the
blacklist check. The outcome/results of the blacklist check are then printed to the console.
