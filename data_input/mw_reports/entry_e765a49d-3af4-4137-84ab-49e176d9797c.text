Warning: Massive "WannaCry" Ransomware campaign launched
blog.gdatasoftware.com/2017/05/29751-wannacry-ransomware-campaign

An outbreak of the latest version of "WannaCry" has been claiming victims in several countries. The
speed and ferocity of the outbreak has taken many by surprise. Researchers are as yet puzzled as to the
origin of the outbreak which hit 11 countries within just three hours. So far Spain and Russia were are
among those who were hit hardest.

Like a bolt from the blue
In the early morning hours (CET) of Friday, May 12, a sizeable wave of infections with the latest iteration
of the WCry / WannaCry ransomware was spotted. Researchers are not sure where the sudden
onslaught came from, but suspicions currently include bot nets, exploit kits, infected emails or malicious
advertizing (also called malvertizing). In Spain, Telef√≥nica, a major ISP, was hit with an infection on one
of their internal servers. From there, things escalated to a point where IT staff are reaching out to
employees to shut down their computers immediately. They were also asked to cut any VPN connections
in order to stop the ransomware from ravaging more parts of the company's network. According to
Spanish newspaper El Mundo, some utility companies had their networks affected in a similar fashion.
According one data source, Russia has reported the highest number of infections.
So far the extent of the damage is unknown.

Implications
The unfolding events make it abundantly clear that ransomware is a problem for companies of all sizes.
Since utilities and telecommunications are considered "essential and critical infrastructure", adequate
measures must be take to secure those.

Countermeasures
Virus signatures should be updated immediately.
G DATA customers are protected. The WannaCry ransomware is detected by all of G DATA's solutions as
Win32.Trojan-Ransom.WannaCry.A.
Since the vulnerability was addressed in the March update for Windows, updates should be installed as
soon as possible. In addition to this, Microsoft has also released a mitigation patch for some legacy
versions of Windows which should also be applied immediately.

Update: May 12, 8:10 pm: more organizations hit
As of this time, reports started pouring in about the victims who are affected by the ransomware wildfire:
Private businesses in Spain and Portugal are hit with WannaCry
2/6

Some computer labs also suffer from the ransomware's ability to spread rapidly through a network
One source reports that computers at the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs are infected
According to a statement from the British NHS, some of their organizations in the UK are affected

Update: May 12, 8:20 pm: WannaCry uses a leaked NSA exploit to infect
machines - how to mitigate
It seems that the mechanism used by WannaCry is based on exploit code originally developed by the
NSA. The Exploit is called ETERNALBLUE and was part of a series of files which were leaked last
month.
The security flaw in SMB which made the exploit possible (also referenced in the NVD) and which was
rated "critical" has been patched by Microsoft during March patch day.
G DATA strongly recommends to install all Windows updates or implement the workaround
suggested by Microsoft as soon as possible.

Update: May 12, 11:20 pm
IOC list updated & Detection names added

Update: May 13, 7:30 am: train timetable displays in Germany infected, NHS
declares "major incident"
First WannaCry infections were reported in the timetable displays of various train stations in
Germany. The infection wave has spread across several hospitals in the UK, forcing staff to use paperbased fallbacks to maintain a basic service level. The NHS declared this a "major incident". Doctors are
joining in with warnings that the WannaCry infections may cost lives.

Update: May 13, 9:15 am - Microsoft releases a mitigation patch for Windows
XP, Windows 8, Server 2003 to address vulnerability
Given that there is still a large number of Windows XP installations out there (including those in critical
places), Microsoft has made an unusual move and issued an update for Windows XP, Windows 8 and
Windows Server 2003.

Update: May 15, 8:30 am: Accidental hero throws a wrench in WannaCry's
works
A security researcher had begun analyzing WannaCry as soon as it hit the ground. During his
examinations he found out that WannaCry attempts to contact a specific domain. The domain was not
registered at the time, so he took it on himself to do so in order to find out what WannaCry wanted to chat
about. This is a common procedure in security research.
It later turned out that the domain was in effect a "killswitch" for WannaCry. The principle is rather simple:
WannaCry contacts the domain and waits for a reply. If a reply comes back, it shuts off and does not
infect the system. Initially, the researcher was not aware of the fact that this killswitch existed, so the fact

3/6

that this discovery helped slow down the infection wave significantly was a happy accident - many news
portals refer to him as "The accidental hero of WannaCry".
This is good news of course: new infections are stopped in their tracks. There are two major caveats
about this, though: the killswitch only works on machines which were not previously infected. It cannot
"clean" an infected system and it will not bring back encrypted files. Also, the killswitch domain will not
work if the to-be-infected machines are located behing a proxy server.
Still, the slowdown allowed security staff to breathe a sigh of relief, albeit a cautious one.

Update: May 15, 8:50 am: "Brace for impact"
As mentioned previosly, the full extent of the infection wave may only become apparent this Monday
morning when workers return to their offices. Therefore users should pay really close attention to any
messages they see on screen and alert their IT department immediately as soon as a ransom note
appears on screen.
It is also goes without saying that email attachments should be treated with utmost caution, especially if
they were received after Thursday, May 11.

Update: May 16, 3:00 pm: Some things are not adding up - Copycats give
researchers trouble - Attribution attempts
Although many researchers are warning that "this is not over yet", there are some things that strike us as
odd around WannaCry. First and foremost, the intention of any ransomware campaign is to rake in
as much money as possible in the shortet amount of time. With the infection count at over 200,000 and
counting, one would expect the attackers' Bitcoin wallets almost bursting at the seams. However, only
three BTC wallets have been identified so far and they only have a meager 60.000 dollars to show
between them. Even if we calculate this in a very conservative manner and assume that about 2,5% of
the victims actually pay up, we should still at least be looking at seven-figures in Bitcoins. That does not
seem to be the case, though, which opens up room for speculations.
There are several possibilities as to why there does not seem to be any money transferred. For instance,
the people behind the ransomware attack may not have anticipated that their creation would be so wildly
successful and were just overwhelmed by the infection rates - triggering decryption in WannaCry's case is
a manual process which on this scale requires a lot of resources.
To make life even more difficult, there are large numbers of "copycat" version circulating. After many
people had gotten their hands on a sample, they started experimenting with it. In some cases, they
disabled the killswitch domain, in other cases its URL is changed. Some of the versions would not even
work as other modifications were made in the file. Those modifications often "break" a file and make it
unusable for infecting a machine. At the time of this writing, several hundred modified versions of the file
have been counted by G DATA and were also added to our detection database.
As with any man-made event that causes great damage, the question of "who done it?" inevitably comes
up. This case is no different. Some researchers point out that some routines of the malware bear
characterisitics that were seen in attacks by an APT group called Lazarus. At this point we cannot rule out
this possibility, but neither can we confim it.

Update: May 17, 9:45 am: Copycats vs. Duplicates
4/6

As mentioned in our previosu update, numerous updates of the WannaCry files are in circulation at this
time. We need to distinguish several categories here:
Variations of the original file with the killswitch removed
Variations with a modified killswitch domain
Variations without ransomware components; those are able to spread without performing any
malicious activities on a system.
"Real" copycats which imitate the ransom note of Wannacry, but do not have any connection to
WannaCry on the technical side.
Correction:
Contrary to what was mentioned in the previous update, the decryption components do not need to be
created manually as they are part of the malware already. However, the decryption process must still be
triggered manually by the attackers.

Update: 17.05., 10:00 Uhr - IoC list updated
Killswitch domain added under "Network-based IoCs"

Update: May 18, 12:30 pm: parking garages in Germany hit with WannaCry distribution method still unclear
According to current reports, the payment systems in some German parking garages are affected by the
WannaCry infection wave. The company that rund the parking garages has not issued a statement about
how much money was lost due to the outage, but this example show very clearly what a direct effect a
ransomware infection can have on everyday operations. This development is problematic for another
reason: should the outage continue for longer, traffic jams may develop because it is now impossible to
keep track of how much parking space (if any) is left in the garage. This would cause drivers to attempt
entering a (full) parking garage.
The exact mehtod used by WannaCry to spread this rapidly is still unclear. However, at this point it seems
unlikely that email attachments were used as a vessel. As previously reported, WannaCry uses a security
flaw in the fil and folder sharing protocol of Microsoft Windows. This akes it possible to distribute the
malware over the internet as the protocol is usually not filtered out by ISPs. This makes an infection more
likely if a system is connected directly to the internet with this feature enabled. Note, though, that this is
also based on conjecture, but for a definitive answer, more information is needed.

Update: May 18,12:30 pm: Makers of WannaCry are speaking up

5/6

Some victims are seeing this message
which supposedly comes from the
attackers.

The message some victims of WannaCry are starting to see

right now (Image credit: Twitter / Thijs Bosschert)
As we have learned about an hour ago, some victims of the WannaCry infection are getting messages on
their screens which appear to come from the attackers. The message asks victims to send the attackers
their unique Bitcoin ID one hour prior to making the payment to speed up the process of receiving their
decryption key.
This is the first time since the infection wave has started that the attackers seem to speak up. We had
already suspected that they may have been overwhelmed by their own success and had difficulties
coping with it.
What is still unclear, though, is where the ransom payment are supposed to go - up to now, only three
BTC wallets have been identified that were associated with the attackers.
We still strongly discourage making any ransom payments.

Update: June 8, 12:00 pm: WannaCry is still no blunt axe
Reports from the Health & Human Services department clearly show that despite its famed kill switch the
danger from WannaCry is not over. Since machines in several hospitals are still affected, HHS
experts advise affected organizations to rebuild (or reimage) affected systems and to install the latest
updates as quickly as possible. Even though the kill switch prevents WannaCry's ransomware module to
kick in and encrypt files, the worm part of WannaCry is not affected by this - WannaCry remains on the
lookout for vulnerable machines.
