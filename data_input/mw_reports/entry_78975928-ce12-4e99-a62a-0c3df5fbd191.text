The HookAds malvertising campaign has been active lately and redirecting visitors to the
Fallout Exploit Kit. Once the kit is activated, it will attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in
Windows to install different malware such as the DanaBot banking Trojan, the Nocturnal
information stealer, and GlobeImposter ransomware.
HookAds is a malvertising campaign that purchases cheap ad space on low quality ad
networks commonly used by adult web sites, online games, or blackhat seo sites. These
ads will include JavaScript that redirects a visitor through a serious of decoy sites that look
like pages filled with native advertisements, online games, or other low quality pages. Under
the right circumstances, a visitor will silently load the Fallout exploit kit, which will try and
install its malware payload.
You can see an example of one of the decoy sites discovered last week by exploit kit
expert nao_sec below.

According to nao_sec, these two campaigns were discovered last week with one
campaign being on November 8th that was distributing the DanaBot password stealing
Trojan and another campaign on November 10th that was installing the Nocturnal stealer
and the GlobeImposter ransomware.

If the redirected user is running Internet Explorer, the Fallout Exploit Kit will attempt to
exploit the Windows CVE-2018-8174 VBScript vulnerability to install the payload.
Therefore, it is very important that users make sure to have all available Windows security
updates installed in order to protect themselves from known vulnerabilities.
