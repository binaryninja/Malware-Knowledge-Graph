Summary
Kaspersky Lab has been tracking a series of attacks utilizing unknown malware since early
2017. The attacks appear to be geopolitically motivated and target high profile organizations.
The objective of the attacks is clearly espionage – they involve gaining access to top
legislative, executive and judicial bodies around the world.
1. The attackers have targeted a large number of organizations globally since early 2017,
with the main focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), especially Palestine.
High-profile organizations have also been targeted in other regions. The number of
attacks has decreased since the beginning of 2018.
2. The attacks were initially discovered while investigating a phishing attack that targeted
political figures in the MENA region. At first the attacks looked to be the work of the
low-sophistication Gaza Cybergang (decoys, file names), but further analysis painted a
very different picture.

3. Targets include high-profile entities such as parliaments, senates, top state offices and
officials, political science scholars, military and intelligence agencies, ministries, media
outlets, research centers, election commissions, Olympic organizations, large trading
companies, and other unknown entities.
4. The malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers,
enabling them to execute any scripts/commands and receive the result via HTTP
requests.
5. Kaspersky Lab users and Threat Management and Defense clients are protected from
the attacks.
Cisco Talos recently published a blogpost describing targeted attacks in the Middle East
region which we believe may be connected.

Victimology and Statistics
Based on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown
geopolitically motivated threat actor. The campaign started in 2017, with the attackers doing
just enough to achieve their goals. They most likely have access to additional tools when
needed and appear to have access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive
organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. The
victim systems range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain
controller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those
responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on.
Victims have been spotted in the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi
Arabia, Djibouti, Qatar, Lebanon, Chile, Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, India, Iran, Canada,
the USA, the UK, Germany, Israel, Afghanistan, Serbia, Russia, Oman, Kuwait, South Korea
and Denmark.

The number of victims/victim organizations probably doesn’t represent the full scope of the
attacks – only a portion.

Attack description and attribution
Operation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle
East region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another
attack group in the region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before
proceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. The targeting
seems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the
desired data or access was obtained. The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously
seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an
elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical
and/or digital).

With deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a
hard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such
as the Middle East.

cyberattacks:

Malware description
The malware was first seen packed with VMProtect; when unpacked the sample didn’t show
any similarities with previously known malware. All the strings and settings were encrypted
and obfuscated. Functionality was identified that enables HTTP communication with the C&C
server and invokes “processcreate” based on parameters received as a response.
The configuration and strings are encrypted using 3DES and Base64 encoding. Data sent to
the C&C server is also encrypted using 3DES and Base64. Different keys are used for local
and network encryption.
The malware starts communicating with the C&C server by sending basic information about
the infected machine. The C&C server then replies with the encrypted serialized
configuration.
The malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers,
enabling them to execute scripts/commands and receive the results via HTTP requests.

What should high-profile organizations do?
High-profile organizations should have elevated levels of cybersecurity. Attacks against them
are inevitable and are unlikely to ever cease. These organizations need to pay particular
attention to their security, implementing additional measures to ensure they are well
protected. Anti-targeted attack solutions, threat intelligence capabilities and data flows,
default-deny application lockdown, endpoint detection and response, data leak and insider
threat prevention, and even isolated/air-gapped networks should form the basis of any
strategy for protecting organizations in the current threat landscape.
The victims of Operation Parliament need to re-evaluate their approach to cybersecurity.
