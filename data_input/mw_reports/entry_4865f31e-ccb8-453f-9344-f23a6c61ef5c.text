On 15 January 2021, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) became
aware of a cyber security incident related to a server used by ASIC.

The incident
On 28 December 2020, an unidentified threat actor accessed an ASIC server containing
attachments to Australian credit licence applications submitted to ASIC between 1 July 2020
and 28 December 2020.
The cyber incident occurred due to a vulnerability in a file transfer appliance (FTA) provided
by California-based Accellion and previously used by ASIC to receive attachments to
Australian credit licence applications.
ASIC engaged independent cyber experts to undertake a forensic investigation. Their
analysis has confirmed there is no evidence that the attachments to credit licence
applications have been read or downloaded. This has not changed.
We were of the view in January 2021 that the filenames of these attachments may have
been viewed.
However, following additional analysis performed by ASICâ€™s independent cyber experts, it is
highly unlikely that the threat actors accessed any data held on the ASIC server, including
filenames of the attachments related to Australian credit licence applications submitted to
ASIC between 1 July 2020 and 28 December 2020.
