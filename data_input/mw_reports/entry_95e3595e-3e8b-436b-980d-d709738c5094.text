Executive summary
AT&T Alien Labs has observed the Mirai variant botnet, known as Moobot, scanning for
known but uncommon vulnerabilities in Tenda routers, resulting in a considerable peak in our
internal telemetry. The research associated with this peak resulted in the discovery of a
malware hosting domain, providing several different Mirai variants, like Moobot and Satori.
Key points:
AT&T Alien Labs identified a short but intense peak in scanning for Tenda routers,
which had been uncommon in previous months.
The Cyberium malware hosting domain has been serving Mirai variants for several
known, but different botnets over the past year.
Our research team has gathered intelligence from previous campaigns launched by
this same attacker; though they made changes in their infrastructure and payloads,
they have mostly recycled their tactics and techniques.

Analysis
During the end of March, AT&T Alien Labs observed a spike in exploitation attempts for
Tenda Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability CVE-2020-10987. This spike was
observed throughout a significant number of clients, in the space of a few hours. This
vulnerability is not commonly used by web scanners and was barely detected by our
honeypots during the last six months, except for a minor peak in November.
This exploit can be identified by the URL that is requested, which includes ‘setUsbUnload’
with the payload assigned to the vulnerable parameter ‘deviceName’. This payload contains
the logic to change the execution path to a temporary location, wget a file from a malware
hosting page, provide execution permissions, and execute it.

Following this thread, a single actor was identified to be behind these scans in late March —
at the time, the actor appeared to have no previous activity. The scan for Tenda vulnerable
routers only lasted one day, but the scanning activity continued for several weeks, including
the below vulnerabilities:
Port 80 and 8080: Axis SSI RCE.
Port 34567: DVR scanner attempting default credentials for Sofia main video
application.
Port 37215: Huawei Home routers RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2017-17215).
Port 52869: Realtek SDK Miniigd UPnP SOAP Command Execution (CVE-2014-8361).
Some of these exploit attempts were captured by honeypots. All of them appeared to be
pulling their next iteration of the malware from the same malware hosting page:
dns.cyberium[.]cc.
When this domain was investigated, several campaigns were identified, going back at least
one year to May 2020. Most of the attacks lasted for approximately a week while they hosted
several Mirai variants, after which they left the subdomain unresolvable. However, this
seems to be the behavior of the threat actor in between operations. The actors appear to
come back to the same domain with a new subdomain for each new campaign. Activity in

2/10

between campaigns goes quiet to increase the trust of the original domain. Keeping a longrunning existing domain while issuing brand new one domain helps to divert attention to the
new domain and thus distract from the original.

All of the domains use the same:

3/10

Registrar: Namecheap.
Top level domain: CC.
All of them served Mirai variants.
The first request to these malware hosting pages was for a bash script, which aimed to
download later stages of the malware. As seen in the screenshot below, the script attempts
to download a list of filenames (associated with different CPU architectures), executes each
one of them, achieves persistence through a crontab that redownloads the bash script itself,
and finally deletes itself.

Figure 3. Tenda downloader script.
This script is very similar to downloaders previously seen for Mirai variants. The minor
modifications appear to be on the downloading server, persistence methods (if any) and the
filename, usually named after the vulnerable device vendor.
During the time this domain was available and delivering malware, at least three different
variants of Mirai were identified: Moobot, Satori/Fbot, and other samples unassociated with
these botnets. One of the peculiarities of this domain was how it juggled between Mirai
variants, even under the same filenames. The same URL could be hosting Satori one day
and Moobot the week after.

Moobot
In October 2020, Lacework reported on a new Mirai variant called Moobot. This variant
mainly chased exposed and vulnerable Dockers APIs to include them into their DDoS botnet.
One of the main distinctions of this variant has been a hardcoded string
“w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, compared to the Mirai source code which used the

4/10

string “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw012345678” as a seed to generate an alphanumeric string.
This random string is used several times throughout the code, one of them to generate the
process name to be used during execution.
Many samples available at Cyberium contained the above-mentioned string and this domain
was already being used to distribute this botnet when Lacework first reported on it. However,
the number of samples Alien Labs has seen with that string has greatly increased in the last
months, scattering from the original Moobot sample. This could potentially mean that last
year's Moobots samples were used to create new branches of Mirai variants.
Unlike some other Mirai variants, the samples obtained from Moobot were encrypted,
attempting to evade string-based detection, static analysis of the exploits used, or after
compromised activities. However, it did maintain other previously seen characteristics, like a
hardcoded list of IP addresses to avoid, such as: private ranges, the department of Defense,
IANA IPs, GE, HP and others.

Figure 4. Moobot’s IP scan restrictions.
The malware writers appear to be very aware of who they’re potential victims are. For this
reason, the malware will try to hide its process name by changing it using prctl. The covert
process name is “/var/Sofia”, which is the name of a video application on the targeted
devices.

Figure 5. Moobot process hideout.
Right after hiding the process, this sample will print to screen the string
“9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p” which has been associated with different Mirai variants over time
(Fbot and Gafgyt). However, it appears this is a passed down characteristic through variant
versions, like previously seen with “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, but this time there
aren’t any shared IOCs with previous attackers.
After successful infection, the payload attempts to query the hardcoded C2 on port 12028 to
get a list of C2. At the time of study, the Cyberium domain was down, and these
communications couldn’t be analyzed.

Satori/Fbot
Early in March 2021, the same links previously mentioned for Moobot, for example
dns.cyberium[.]cc/arm, were actually providing samples for Satori. The Satori botnet, also
known as Fbot, is yet another Mirai variant based botnet. Unexpectedly, these samples were
mingled with other UNIX botnets in the same malware hosting server.
The similarities between Moobot and Satori samples are vast, since they both are coming
from the same Mirai source code. These similarities include:
Downloading method
Vulnerability scannings and targets in IoT devices
The String 9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p printed after execution
Process name to hide behind (/var/Sofia) (despite having seen other Satori samples
hiding behind /bin/busybox)
The most noteworthy differences observed were:
6/10

The string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f” wasn’t present in the Satori samples
The C2 domain for Satori where it notifies successful infection is bin.rippr[.]cc, which
has been previously associated with other Satori campaigns
In the first observed samples, the code wasn’t encrypted and many more strings could
be read without any additional operations — unlike Moobot samples that were encoded
to reduce the number of strings in plain text

Other samples
Additional samples were identified under the same domain, which on a first investigation
appeared to be a mix between the already mentioned Moobot and Satori samples with a
random combination of their characteristics. Most of them looked like Moobot samples
without the encoding or Satori without the hardcoded domain.
However, the samples are not associated with the current domain under study, probably
because it is being left fallow. After pivoting on the scanning IP, delivering the downloaders
scripts, it is currently providing the same script with an updated temporary domain, which is
currently delivering additional Satori/Fbot samples packed with UPX.

Recommended Actions
1. Keep all IoT devices updated, and specifically focus on addressing the mentioned
devices or CVEs.
2. Monitor network traffic for known incoming exploits.
3. Monitor egress and ingress network traffic to the Cyberium or ripper domain.
4. Regularly perform process auditing and accounting looking for known malicious
processes names that a botnet could be hiding under.

Conclusion
Alien Labs has identified the Cyberium malware hosting domain to be providing many
different Mirai variants, like Moobot or Satori, during the last year. Actors have been jumping
between subdomains to recycle their infrastructure as most as possible. At the time of
publishing this blog (May 2021) some of the Cyberium subdomains were up, but they were
not hosting any malware samples. They could be potentially awaiting new requests for C2
lists.
Several questions remain unanswered. Why would the attackers deliver different Mirai
variants with different C2s on the same campaign? And, are they trying to avoid anti-virus
detection through diversification of variants? Or, are they trying to improve the botnet
resiliency by diversifying C2.
