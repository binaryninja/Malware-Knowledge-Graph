Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of
the Department of Defense (DoD). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the N
referred to by the U.S. Government as BADCALL. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HID
information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov /hiddencobra.
FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers to maintain a presence on vict
further network exploitation. DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean gover
activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use
should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NC
Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This report provides analysis of four (4) malicious executable files. The first three (3) files are 32-bit Windows executables that function as proxy s
"Fake TLS" method similar to the behavior described in a previously published NCCIC report, MAR-10135536-B. The fourth file is an Android Pac
designed to run on Android platforms as a fully functioning Remote Access Tool (RAT).

Description

This file is a malicious 32-bit Windows executable. Analysis indicates this application is designed to force a compromised system to function as a
executed, the malware binds and listens for incoming connections on port 8000 of the compromised system. The proxy session traffic is protected
cipher based on rotating XOR and ADD. The cipher will XOR each byte sent with 47h and added by 28h. Each byte received by the malware will
subtracted by 28h. See Figures 1, 2 and 3 for code examples. Notably, this malware attempts to disable the Windows firewall before binding to po
following registry key:
--Begin Firewall Reg Key Modified-SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\StandardProfile\GloballyOpenPorts\\List
--End Firewall Reg Key Modified-Analysis of this malware indicates it is designed to turn a victim host into a "hop point" by relaying traffic to a remote system. When the adversary
victim’s machine via port 8000, the adversary must first authenticate (over a session secured with the XOR/ADD cipher described above) by provi
"1qazXSDC23we”. If the malware does not receive this value, it will terminate the session, responding with the value "m*^&^ghfge4wer”.
If the operator authenticates successfully, they can then issue the command "ghfghjuyufgdgftr" which instructs the malware to begin functioning a
respond to the operator with the value "q45tyu6hgvhi7^%$sdf”. Next, the malware attempts to create a proxy session between the operator and a
process, the malware will attempt to authenticate with the destination server by sending the value "ghfghjuyufgdgftr" as a challenge. To complete
sequence, the malware expects to receive a response value of "q45tyu6hgvhi7^%$sdf". All challenge and response traffic is encoded using the A
described earlier.
The proxy session begins with a remote operator connecting to this implant via a "fake TLS" connection attempt, similar to the behavior described
NCCIC report, MAR-10135536-B. Essentially, the malware initiates the TLS session using one of several public SSL certificates obtained from we
internet services and embedded in the malware. However, the traffic from the operator to this implant is not protected with SSL / TLS encryption. T
protected via the ADD/XOR cipher embedded within this implant (see Figure 2-3.). If the remote operator authenticates correctly as detailed abov
begin a proxy session with the remote target system. The traffic to the remote systems from this implant are sent and received via the SSL_read a
available in OpenSSL. However, the malware does not appear to attempt to load an SSL private key or certificate.
The malware contains public SSL certificates for the following list of domains, which are used for initiating the "fake TLS" session:

Description

This file is a 32-bit DLL file. Static analysis indicates this application is very similar in structure and function to C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE14
This DLL is designed to force a compromised system to act as a proxy server. This implant is designed to proxy network traffic from an operator to
that is being operated by the adversary on a remote system. The traffic to and from this proxy server will be protected with the same simple XOR
malware C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230.
Static analysis indicates the OpenSSL library is used to implement a TLS/SSL initialization between the operator and this implant. The malware w

key from a file named 'wbemhost.dll' (see Figure 11.) and a certificate from a file named 'netconf.dll'. The malware does not drop these two files, t
be already dropped on the system using another method.
Analysis of this malware indicates it is designed to bind to and listen for incoming connections on port 443 of a victim’s system after disabling the f
following registry key:
--Begin Firewall Reg Key Modified-SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\StandardProfile
GloballyOpenPorts\\List
--End Firewall Reg Key Modified-Static analysis indicates the malware attempts to read configuration data from the following registry key:
--Begin Config Registry Key -Key: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\windows\CurrentVersion\NetConfigs

--End Config Registry Key-The registry key name is decrypted via RC4 and the malware will attempt to decrypt the contents by using RC4 if the key is present on the victim's
binds and listens for C2 sessions on the victim's system (see Figure 12.). Once a C2 session is received on a binded port the malware will read th
OpenSSL library and will decode it using a simple rotating XOR / ADD cipher.
After decrypting the incoming traffic the implant ensures it contains the following authentication value:
--Begin Auth Value-qwertyuiop
--End Auth Value-If the authentication value exists, the implant knows the external operator wants to proxy traffic through to another location. The malware will resp
encoded value "asdfghjkl" to let the operator know it is ready to proceed with the proxy requests. Static analysis indicates the malware will connec
via the Fake TLS protocol mentioned in prior analysis. SSL encryption will not be used to secure communications between this implant and the re
will simply use its embedded XOR / ADD cipher (view screenshot). The malware notifies the remote proxy server it wants to open a session by se
"1qazXSDC23we". It then expects the remote proxy server to respond with the value "m*^&^ghfge4wer". If the remote proxy server does not resp
proxy session will not continue.
Analysis indicates the malware also contains a large structure capable of gathering a great deal of information about the victim's system including
and attached adapters. If the following authentication value is received from the external operator, the malware knows the operator wants to gathe
victim's system:
--Begin Auth Value-ghfghjuyufgdgftr
--End Auth Value--

The malware will then respond with the XOR / ADD encoded value "q45tyu6hgvhi7^%$sdf" to let the remote operator know that it received the co

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
