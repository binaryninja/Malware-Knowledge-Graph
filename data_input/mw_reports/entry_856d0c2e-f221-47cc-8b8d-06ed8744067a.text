January 17, 2022

Ransomware is a category of malware that uses various encryption algorithms to encrypt crucial data on the
user’s machine and demands the user for ransom. AvosLocker is a ransomware group identified in 2021,
specifically targeting Windows machines. Additionally, Cyble Research Labs have come across a Twitter post
that mentioned a new Linux variant of AvosLocker ransomware targeting VMware ESXi servers. In this blog
post, we will discuss AvosLocker Linux ransomware in detail.
Cyble Research Labs found through dark/deepweb research that the Threats Actors (TAs) or affiliates of
AvosLocker ransomware groups are using Proxyshell to exploit Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities
compromising victim’s network, such as CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31206, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE2021-31207. Once the TAs access the machine, they deploy mimikatz to dump passwords. TAs can get RDP
access to the domain controller by using the identified passwords, exfiltrating data from the compromised
machine. Finally, AvosLocker ransomware gets deployed on the victim system by the attacker to encrypt the
victim’s documents and files.

Technical analysis

1/8

Based on static analysis, we found that the malicious file is an x64 based Executable and Linkable Format
(ELF) file, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 – Static

ELF File Details
Upon executing the AvosLocker ransomware on Linux machines, it instructs the user to run a command which
has the parameter that specifies the path of the directory to be encrypted. Also, the command has another
parameter that denotes the number of threads to be involved in the encryption process. The in-built
multithreading functionality helps TAs to encrypt the files faster, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 – Malware Instructs

for Drive Path
After execution, the AvosLocker checks the presence of VMware Elastic Sky X Integrated (ESXi), Virtual
Machine File System (VMFS), and kills the Virtual Machines (VMs) if they are running using the command
given in the figure below.

Figure 3 – Command to Kill ESXi VMs
The below figure demonstrates that the malware appends the extension as .avoslinux after encrypting the files
on the victim’s machine.

Before encrypting the files, the malware performs thread synchronization operation using mutex lock/unlock
APIs to avoid overlapping the encryption process, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 – Thread Synchronization Encrypting the Files

The content of an encrypted file has base64 encoded content at the end of the file. As shown in the figure
below, we suspect that the base64 encoded data contains a cryptographic key used to encrypt the file.

Figure 6 – Encrypted File Contents
Before starting the encryption process, the malware drops ransom notes with the name
README_FOR_RESTORE.txt in the specific drive. Then, like other ransomware groups, the attackers instruct
the victims to visit the TOR website, as shown in the figure below.

Figure 7 – Ransom note
When the victim visits AvosLocker’s TOR website, it asks for the ID given on the ransom note to proceed with
the payment process, as shown in the below figure.

TOR Website
Once the victim enters the ID, the website redirects to the payment page where TAs instructs victims to pay
USD 1,000,000.00/ 4629.63 XMR/ 28.61 BTC (25% processing fee) – the ransom amount would double if the
victim does not pay the ransom before the deadline.
For payment through Monero, the TAs has provided Monero ID and the payment ID, as shown in Figure 9.

Other Observations
Cyble Research Labs had found that the TAs leaked their victim’s details on their leak website when victims
failed to pay the ransom. The following figure showcases the Avoslocker leak website with recent victims.

Also, the leak site noted that TAs had mentioned an affiliate program that provides Ransomware as a Service
(RaaS), which includes Affiliate panels, Calling Services, etc., as shown in the below figure.

The ransomware groups are looking for support to expand their cybercrime ransomware business in the
countries such as the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, as shown in the figure below.

Conclusion
There is likely a new version of AvosLocker ransomware for the Linux platform. The latest version is where
cybercriminals added a unique code to evolve their Raas services with new Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTP), which targets ESXi and VMFS machines. Therefore, we believe that there may be an
enhancement in the form of an upcoming variant of the AvosLocker ransomware.
We are continuously monitoring AvosLocker’s extortion campaign and updating our readers with the latest
information as and when we find it.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:

Safety measures needed to prevent ransomware attacks
Conduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.

6/8

Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected devices
wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices, including
PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.

Users should take the following steps after a ransomware attack
Detach infected devices on the same network.
Disconnect external storage devices if connected
Inspect system logs for doubtful events.

Impacts and cruciality Of AvosLocker Ransomware
Loss of Valuable data.
Loss of organizations reliability or integrity.
Loss of organisation’s businesses information.
Disruption in organization operation.
Economic loss.
