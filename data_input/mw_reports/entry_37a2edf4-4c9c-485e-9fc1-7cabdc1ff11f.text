Shared infrastructure
To date, we have found fifteen onion addresses used by at least four different servers, and
three others still unknown.

Table 2. The different servers in relation to XingLocker and AstroLocker Team
While this is not a sophisticated innovation, it is important to highlight that ransomware
groups are looking for new ways to run their affiliate programs and RaaS businesses. This
form of shared infrastructure and code can make things harder from an investigative point of
view. It is not uncommon to find XingLocker samples detected as Mount Locker, or identify
two different onion addresses pointing to the same onion service but used by different
groups. Investigators should be aware of these factors when researching ransomware.
Why is this important? Most RaaS models operate by affiliates working with the ransomware
group to install a specifically named ransomware on as many machines as possible, then
splitting the profits. This is advantageous for the attackers because when victims look up the

ransomware and see many reports about it, they are more likely to pay. As a disadvantage,
affiliates are largely anonymous and can’t use these attacks as the basis of THEIR own
criminal business. They are just like managers in a burger chain.
It seems likely we have now observed a new "franchise" RaaS model involving XingLocker,
AstroLocker and Mount Locker. In this model there seems to be a main RaaS (in this case
Mount Locker), and then affiliates license the ransomware and release it under their own
name and brand.
In this scenario, the affiliates are like managers of their own local burger joint, getting
products from a generic food supplier. The products are provided by the parent company, but
the individual operators conduct business under their own branding, with unique names and
images. This method gives more flexibility and recognition for the affiliates, especially midtier aspiring criminal gang leaders. One disadvantage is that it means less brand recognition
for specific ransomware, so victims may be less inclined to pay. Of course, from an
investigation point of view, this method adds confusion in terms of naming and makes
tracking harder.
How to Defend Against Ransomware
Ransomware is a continuously evolving threat, and organizations should be vigilant in
maintaining the best and most effective security policies and practices. Protection
frameworks set by the Center of Internet Security and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology can help organizations prevent and mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks:
Audit and inventory: Take an inventory of all organizational assets and data, and
identify authorized and unauthorized devices, software, and personnel accessing
particular systems. Audit and monitor all logs of events and incidents to identify
unusual patterns and behaviors.
Configure and monitor: Deliberately manage hardware and software configurations,
and only grant administrative privileges and access to specific personnel when
absolutely necessary. Monitor the use of network ports, protocols, and services.
Implement security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls
and routers, and have a software allow list to prevent malicious applications from being
executed.
Patch and update: Perform periodic vulnerability assessments, and conduct regular
patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications. Ensure that all
installed software and applications are updated to their latest versions.
Protect and recover: Enforce data protection, backup, and recovery measures.
Implement multifactor authentication in all devices and platforms used whenever
available.

Secure and defend: Perform sandbox analysis to examine and block malicious emails.
Employ the latest version of security solutions to all layers of the system, including
email, endpoint, web, and network. Spot early signs of an attack such as the presence
of suspicious tools in the system, and enable advanced detection technologies such as
those powered with AI and machine learning.
Train and test: Perform security skills assessment and training for all personnel
regularly, and conduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.
Trend Micro Solutions
Organizations can benefit from security solutions that encompass a system’s multiple layers
(endpoint, email, web, and network) not only for detecting malicious components but also for
close monitoring of suspicious behaviors in the network.
Trend Micro™ Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection,
spotting questionable behaviors that might otherwise seem benign when viewed from only a
single layer. For an even closer inspection of endpoints, Trend Micro Apex One™ offers
next-level automated threat detection and response against advanced concerns such as
fileless threats and ransomware. This allows detecting and blocking ransomware early on
before it can do any real damage to the system.
With techniques such as virtual patching and machine learning, Trend Micro™ Cloud One™
Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit
vulnerabilities. It also takes advantage of the latest in global threat intelligence to provide upto-date, real-time protection.
Ransomware often gets into the system through phishing emails. Trend Micro™ Deep
Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis techniques
to effectively block ransomware before it gets into the system.

Ransomware
We found a relatively new and interesting ransomware operation that takes inspiration from
franchise business models. It seems that the operators are rebranding a "supplier"
ransomware before deployment instead of simply distributing it under the original name.
