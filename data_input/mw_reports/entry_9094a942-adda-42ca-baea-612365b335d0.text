Kittens Go Phishing

1/5

Rocket Kitten refers to a cyber threat group that has been hitting different public and private
Israeli/European organizations. It has launched two campaigns so far: a malware campaign
that exclusively makes use of GHOLE malware, as well as a targeted attack dubbed as
“Operation Woolen-GoldFish” that's possibly state-sponsored.
GHOLE is a malware family that was discussed in the 31st Chaos Communication Congress
of the Chaos Computer Club (31C3), during a lecture that tackled its ongoing involvement in
targeted attacks. Based on the compilation date of its oldest samples, the malware is
believed to have been active since 2011, and has been used by Rocket Kitten in their
targeted attacks.
Operation Woolen-GoldFish, on the other hand, is a cyber attack campaign that we suspect
to be state-sponsored, or at the very least politically-motivated. It has been attacking the
following targets:
Civilian organizations in Israel
Academic organizations in Israel
German speaking government organizations
European government organizations
European private companies

Background, Analysis, Findings
GHOLE Malware Campaign:
In February 2015, we received an alert that involved an infected Excel file that, upon
analysis, proved to be part of the GHOLE malware campaign, one of Rocket Kitten’s
campaigns.

The GHOLE malware campaign involves victims being sent spear-phishing emails with
malicious attachments. The attachment is usually an Excel file that contains a
malicious macro.
When clicked, the Excel file drops a .DLL file that will then be executed by the
malicious macro embedded in the Excel file.
The Excel file is tailored to trick the user into running the macro. If the user does not
enable the macro content, the .DLL file will not be executed.
GHOLE is a malware family derived from a modified Core Impact product. Core Impact
is a penetration-testing product made by Core Security, a legitimate company.
Further analysis revealed that the GHOLE variants involved in the operation connect to
C&C servers hosted mainly in Germany. The servers are registered under one
customer by the name of Mehdi Mavadi. We are hesitant in attributing the attack to
such an identity as the name itself is quite common, and that the customer’s servers
may simply be compromised and being used as a proxy rather than actually providing
infrastructure for the Rocket Kitten group.
Operation Woolen-GoldFish:
Similar to the GHOLE malware campaign, Operation Woolen Goldfish involves spearphishing emailsembedded with a malicious link that leads to a OneDrive link. The link
goes directly to a malicious file download.
The malware payload was initially found to be a variant of GHOLE, but further samples
led to te discovery of a new payload: a variant of a keylogger known as the CWoolger
keylogger. It is detected as TSPY_WOOLERG.A.
Possible Attribution
Analyzing the malicious documents in the spear phishing emails of their Microsoft Office
metadata, we narrowed down the suspects to one “Wool3n.H4t”, whose name appears in
most of the document samples found as the last known modifier. His other accomplices
include entities who go by the names “aikido1” and “Hoffman”.
We looked deeper into the identity of Wool3n.H4t and discovered the following:
He may have been running an underground hacking blog under the same nickname,
with the only two entries signed by “Masoud_pk”
“Masoud_pk” may possibly be the true identity of Wool3n.H4t. “Masoud” belongs in the
top 500 commonly used first names in Iran.
A debug string found in the CWoolger keylogger code shows that the compiler is
identified as Wool3n.H4T.
Conclusion

4/5

This report explores Rocket Kitten by analyzing the tools used to leverage its malicious
activities. From our findings we can definitely say that threat actor team is alive and active,
and while the tracks they left behind—as well as their use of macros—might make them
seem a bit inexperienced, they are slowly improving and gaining traction.
We are also able to confirm that Wool3n.H4T is not only responsible for most of the infecting
Office documents used, but also capable of developing malware.
With all the evidence, Rocket Kitten’s attacks can be construed as politically-motivated, as
the targeted entities do share a particular interest in the Islamic Republic of Iran. While
motives behind targeted attack campaigns differ, the end results are one and the same: shift
in power control either in the economically or politically.
