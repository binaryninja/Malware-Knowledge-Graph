Mobile Campaign ‘Bouncing Golf’ Affects Middle East
trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/f/mobile-cyberespionage-campaign-bouncing-golf-affects-middle-east.html
June 18, 2019

We uncovered a cyberespionage campaign targeting Middle Eastern countries. We named
this campaign “Bouncing Golf” based on the malware’s code in the package named “golf.”
The malware involved, which Trend Micro detects as AndroidOS_GolfSpy.HRX, is notable
for its wide range of cyberespionage capabilities. Malicious codes are embedded in apps that
the operators repackaged from legitimate applications. Monitoring the command and control
(C&C) servers used by Bouncing Golf, we’ve so far observed more than 660 Android devices
infected with GolfSpy. Much of the information being stolen appear to be military-related.
The campaign’s attack vector is also interesting. These repackaged, malware-laden apps are
neither on Google Play nor popular third-party app marketplaces, and we only saw the
website hosting the malicious apps being promoted on social media when we followed
GolfSpy’s trail. We were also able to analyze some GolfSpy samples sourced from the Trend
Micro mobile app reputation service.
Also of note is Bouncing Golf’s possible connection to a previously reported mobile
cyberespionage campaign that researchers named Domestic Kitten. The strings of code, for
one, are similarly structured. The data targeted for theft also have similar formats.

GolfSpy's Potential Impact
Given GolfSpy’s information-stealing capabilities, this malware can effectively hijack an
infected Android device. Here is a list of information that GolfSpy steals:
Device accounts
List of applications installed in the device
Device’s current running processes
Battery status
Bookmarks/Histories of the device’s default browser
Call logs and records
Clipboard contents
Contacts, including those in VCard format
Mobile operator information
Files stored on SDcard
Device location
List of image, audio, and video files stored on the device
2/10

Storage and memory information
Connection information
Sensor information
SMS messages
Pictures
GolfSpy also has a function that lets it connect to a remote server to fetch and perform
commands, including: searching for, listing, deleting, and renaming files as well as
downloading a file into and retrieving a file from the device; taking screenshots; installing
other application packages (APK); recording audio and video; and updating the malware.
Technical Analysis
The repackaged applications are embedded with malicious code, which can be found in the
com.golf package. These repackaged apps pose as communication, news, lifestyle, book,
and reference apps popularly used in the Middle East. The GolfSpy malware embedded in
the apps is hardcoded with an internal name used by the attacker.

As shown in Figure 3, GolfSpy’s configurations (e.g., C&C server, secret keys) are encoded
by a customized algorithm. After it is launched, GolfSpy will generate a unique ID for the
affected device and then collect its data such as SMS, contact list, location, and accounts in
this format: “%,[],time”(shown in Figure 4). The information is written into a file on the
device. The attacker can choose the data types to collect, which are written in a certain
format.

The value of % is in the range of 1-9 or a-j. Each value represents a different type of data to
steal from the device:

Table 1. The type of data corresponding to the value coded in GolfSpy
Figure 5 shows the code snippets that are involved in monitoring and recording the device’s
phone call. It will also take a photo using the device’s front camera when the user wakes the
device.
Apart from collecting the above data, the spyware monitors users’ phone calls, records them,
and saves the recorded file on the device. GolfSpy encrypts all the stolen data using a
simple XOR operation with a pre-configured key before sending it to the C&C server using
the HTTP POST method.

(bottom)
The malware retrieves commands from the C&C server via HTTP, and attackers can steal
specific files on the infected device. The command is a constructed string split into three
parts using "<DEL>" as a separator. The first part is the target directory, the second is a
regular expression used to match specific files, while the last part is an ID.

application (top), and GolfSpy’s parse-and-perform command (bottom)
Apart from the HTTP POST method, GolfSpy also creates a socket connection to the remote
C&C server in order to receive and perform additional commands. Stolen data will also be
encrypted and sent to the C&C server via the socket connection. The encryption key is
different from the one used for sending stolen data via HTTP.

Correlating Bouncing Golf's Activities
We monitored Bouncing Golf’s C&C-related activities and saw that the campaign has
affected more than 660 devices as of this writing. The small or limited number is
understandable given the nature of this campaign, but we also expect it to increase or even
diversify in terms of distribution. Most of the affected devices were located in the Middle East,
and many of the stolen data we saw is military-related (e.g., images, documents).
Bouncing Golf’s operators also try to cover their tracks. The registrant contact details of the
C&C domains used in the campaign, for instance, were masked. The C&C server IP
addresses used also appear to be disparate, as they were located in many European
countries like Russia, France, Holland, and Germany.
It’s not a definite correlation, but Bouncing Golf also seems to have a connection with
Domestic Kitten due to similarities we found in their code. For example, the Android malware
that both deploy share the same strings of code for their decoding algorithm. The data that
Domestic Kitten steals follows a similar format with Bouncing Golf’s, with each type of data
having a unique identifying character. It’s also worth noting that both campaigns repackage
apps that are commonly used in their target’s countries, such as Telegram, Kik, and Plus
messaging apps.

As we’ve seen in last year’s mobile threat landscape, we expect more cyberespionage
campaigns targeting the mobile platform given its ubiquity, employing tried-and-tested
techniques to lure unwitting users. The extent of information that these kinds of threats can
steal is also significant, as it lets attackers virtually take over a compromised device. Users
should adopt best practices, while organizations should ensure that they balance the need
for mobility and the importance of security.
End users and enterprises can also benefit from multilayered mobile security solutions such
as Trend Micro™ Mobile Security™ . Trend Micro™ Mobile Security for Enterprise provides
device, compliance and application management, data protection, and configuration
provisioning, as well as protects devices from attacks that exploit vulnerabilities, preventing
unauthorized access to apps, and detecting and blocking malware and fraudulent
websites. Trend Micro’s Mobile App Reputation Service (MARS) covers Android and iOS
threats using leading sandbox and machine learning technologies, protecting devices against
malware, zero-day and known exploits, privacy leaks, and application vulnerabilities.
A list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) is in this appendix.
