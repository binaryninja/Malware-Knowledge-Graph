Introduction
For the past month or so, I hadn't had any luck finding active malspam campaigns pushing
Dridex malware. That changed starting this week, and I've since found several examples.
Today's diary reviews an infection from Wednesday September 9th, 2020.
The Word documents
While searching VirusTotal, I found three documents with the same template that generated
the same type of traffic (read: SHA256 hash - name):
fee5bb973112d58445d9e267e0ceea137d9cc1fb8a7140cf9a67472c9499a30f - Info3948683568.doc

1/11

Shown above: Screenshot with template used by all three of the above listed Word
documents.
My lab environment revealed these documents are designed to infect a vulnerable Windows
host with Dridex.
Enabling macros caused Powershell to retrieve a DLL file from one of the following URLs
over encrypted HTTPS traffic:
hxxps://teworhfoundation[.]com/4jvmow.zip
hxxps://teworhfoundation[.]com/zd0pcc.rar
hxxps://thecandidtales[.]com/doakai.zip
hxxps://safaktasarim[.]com/7zcsfo.txt
hxxps://thecandidtales[.]com/wuom4a.rar

After the DLL was saved under the victim's profile, it was run using rundll32.exe. The DLL is
an installer for Dridex, and it was run using the following command:
"C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe" C:\Users\[username]\Mqfzqp8\Opzvzn2\Qzpic6r.dll 0

Shown above: Location of the initial DLL to install Dridex on an infected Windows host.
Dridex infection traffic
Dridex post-infection traffic is all HTTPS. In this case, we saw HTTPS traffic over the
following IP addresses and ports:
67.213.75[.]205 port 443
54.39.34[.]26 port 453

Shown above: Traffic from the Dridex infection filtered in Wireshark.
Most of the Dridex post-infection traffic I've seen uses IP addresses without domain names,
and issuer data for the SSL/TLS certificates is somewhat unusual. Certificate issuer data for
the Dridex post-infection traffic:

Dridex persistent on an infected Windows host
Dridex is made persistent on an infected Windows host using 3 methods simultaneously:
Windows registry update
Scheduled task
Windows startup menu shortcut
Dridex uses copies of legitimate Windows system files (EXEs) to load and run malware.
Dridex DLL files are named as DLLs that would normally be run by these copied system
EXEs.
For this infection, all of the persistent Dridex DLL files were 64-bit DLL files.
WINDOWS REGISTRY UPDATE:
- Registry Key: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- Value name: Vwqmkqmr
- Value type: REG_SZ
- Value data: C:\Users\
[username]\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\1ovarfyl.default-release\
ImapMail\.outlook.com\Uw0NWHoOi\DWWIN.EXE
NOTE: DWWIN.EXE loads and runs a Dridex DLL file named VERSION.dll in the same
directory.

5/11

Shown above: Windows registry update used to keep Dridex persistent on an infected host.

Shown above: Legitimate EXE called by registry update, and Dridex DLL in the same
directory.
SCHEDULED TASK:
- Task name: Qgdopf
- Action: Start a program
- Details: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Accessories\
0pFtxbOGXwr\DmNotificationBroker.exe
NOTE: DmNotificationBroker.exe loads and runs a Dridex DLL file named DUI70.dll in
the same directory.

6/11

Shown above: Scheduled task on the same infected Windows host also used to keep Dridex
persistent.

Shown above: Legitimate EXE called by scheduled task, and Dridex DLL in the same
directory.
WINDOWS STARTUP MENU SHORTCUT:
Shortcut: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Somdjvzvjfch.lnk
Target: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Extensions\r0F\msinfo32.exe
NOTE: msinfo32.exe loads and runs a Dridex DLL file named MFC42u.dll in the same
directory.

7/11

Shown above: Windows start menu shortcut also used to keep Dridex persistent on the
same infected Windows host.

Shown above: Legitimate EXE called by start menu shortcut, and Dridex DLL in the same
directory.

Final words
After a period of inactivity, malspam pushing Dridex malware is back, so this blog post
reviewed traffic and malware from an infected Windows host. While not much has changed,
it's always good to have a refresher.
As usual, up-to-date Windows hosts with the latest security patches and users who follow
best security practices are not likely to get infected with this malware. However, I've seen so
much come through in the past two or three days that even a small percentage of success
will likely be profitable for the criminals behind it.
