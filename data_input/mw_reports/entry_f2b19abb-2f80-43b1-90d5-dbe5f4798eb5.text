Intel-owned AI processor developer Habana Labs has suffered a cyberattack where data
was stolen and leaked by threat actors.
Habana Labs is an Israeli developer of AI processors that accelerate artificial intelligence
workloads in the datacenter. Intel purchased the company in December 2019 for
approximately $2 billion.
Today, the Pay2Key ransomware operation leaked data allegedly stolen from Habana Labs
during a cyberattack. This data includes Windows domain account information, DNS zone
information for the domain, and a file listing from its Gerrit development code review
system.

Pay2Key data leak page for Habana Labs
In addition to the content posted on their data leak site, the Pay2Key operators have leaked
business documents and source code images.

code stolen from Habana Labs
In a threat posted to Pay2Key's data leak site, the threat actors have stated that Habana
Labs has "72hrs to stop leaking process..." It is not known what ransom demands are being
made, if any, to stop the leaking of data.

It is believed that this attack is not meant to generate revenue for the threat actors but
rather to cause havoc for Israeli interests.
BleepingComputer has contacted Habana Labs with questions regarding the attack but has
not heard back.

Pay2Key responsible for recent Israeli cyberattacks
Pay2Key is a relatively new ransomware operation behind a series of attacks against Israeli
businesses in November 2020, as reported by Israeli cybersecurity firms Check Point and
Profero.
Profero believes Iranian threat actors are behind the ransomware operation after tracking
the group's ransom payment wallets to Iranian bitcoin exchanges.

SME dubbed "Pay2Key". Using intelligence sources and our latest CryptoCurrency
monitoring capabilities, we have been able to track the exit strategy of the threat
actors leading to Iranian exchange. pic.twitter.com/64WzsonAjQ

Israeli media has reported that threat actors breached Israeli shipping and cargo software
company Amital this week and used their access to compromise forty of the software
company's clients in a supply chain attack.
While performing incident response, Profero and Israeli cybersecurity firm Security
Joes have linked IOCs from these attacks to those discovered in previous Pay2Key attacks.
Our joint @ProferoSec & @SecurityJoes IR teams have been able to correlate
infrastructure of previous pay2key ransomware attacks to the current shipment and
cargo infiltration. This is another major escalation in the current cyber-conflict
between Israel and Iran. pic.twitter.com/idIWAm8JTb

Profero CEO Omri Moyal is warning Israeli companies to harden their network's defenses
as further cyberattacks from Iran are expected.

Another threat actor known as BlackShadow was responsible for a recent cyberattack
against Israeli insurance company Shirbit whose data was stolen and leaked. While the
Shirbit attack is similar to the Pay2Key's attacks, it is unknown if they are linked.
