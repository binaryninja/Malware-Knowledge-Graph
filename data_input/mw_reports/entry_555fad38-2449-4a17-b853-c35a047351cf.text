I recently ran into an interesting piece of malware that was downloaded on a victim's
computer. I thought it was TDL/TDSS or maybe a new version of it as it had same
components as TDL4 bootkit with a functionality of a mass scale PPC (pay-per-click) fraud.
TDL had this functionality too and it is most likely spread by the same Russian-speaking
gangs using the Blackhole exploit kit. It did not have the same type of config file that you may
find in TDL4 (and first I could not find it at all). I call it "Purple Haze" thanks to the strings
found in the code.
I shared it with Alexander Matrosov from ESET. He and Eugene Rodionov analyzed it and
posted an article on the ESET blog: "TDL4 reloaded: Purple Haze all in my brain" (edited by
David Harley)

Desription
You can read more detailed binary analysis on the ESET blog (Feb.2 2012) : "TDL4
reloaded: Purple Haze all in my brain"
Update. Feb 2, 2012
I heard today it is a recent but known variant detected by Kaspersky as "Pihar", which is
supposedly a member of the TDL/TDSS/Olmarik/Alureon/ - Maxss family that does not
encrypt the hidden container. I have to say I saw that Kaspersky detected it as Pihar.b via
TDSS Killer (the dropper is detected as FakeAV) but it was a totally different name and I
could not find any explanation of how Pihar is different from TDL4 - whether it is a
misdetection, a different rootkit, some generic signature name, or a different variant of TDL.
With the number of malware variants these days in the wild, it does not surprise me that it
was known to them but there was no analysis posted (or I did not find it). I hope this analysis
and the work done by ESET will make the family description more complete. TDSS Killer
also removes it.
It is a kernel mode rootkit compatible with x86 and x64 Windows. It uses dll injection ph.dll
and phx.dll (for x64). It creates a hidden VFS to store all the data.
The list of hidden system files:
1. Phdata

pn=161
all=ph.dll

2. phm (original master boot record)

4. phx.dll (payload dll for x64)

Traffic
Pay-per-click fraud generates significant revenue for the botnet owners. The ‘Advertising’
Botnet" article from Securelist explains the click fraud scheme in great detail.

C&C check-in upon install

The bot generates high volume traffic to thousands of websites with ads, sites serving as
referrers, as well as pages filled with ad links (over 800 sessions a minute) for approximately
2 hours and then stops. Most serious advertising companies easily detect large clicks from
the same ip and block it. The botnet owners limit clicks to just a few and compensate it by
programming the bot to click on thousands of ads.

Click to enlarge. 11 hours of traffic monitoring. 2 hour spike following the infection.
Traffic capture - Using fake referrer (serch-direct.com) and passing fake search strings to the
C&C, which responds with iframe redirect to the ad link.

There are hundreds of fake search and referrer sites in use in this case, starting from pages
containing nothing but ad links and ending with several ip ranges serving iframe.The list of
servers is below

Fake referrer = serch

The list of servers serving iframe content is limited to several 108.59.x.x ranges.
They all are hosted
108.59.4.128/27
108.59.7.0/27
