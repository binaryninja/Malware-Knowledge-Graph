has made a comeback in 2014 (see our previous blog

in Ukraine and Poland and BlackEnergy PowerPoint
Campaigns, as well as our Virus Bulletin talk on the
subject), was also active in the year 2015.
ESET has recently discovered that the BlackEnergy
trojan was recently used as a backdoor to deliver a
destructive KillDisk component in attacks against
Ukrainian news media companies and against the
electrical power industry. In this blog, we provide
details on the BlackEnergy samples ESET has detected
in 2015, as well as the KillDisk components used in the
attacks. Furthermore, we examine a previously
unknown SSH backdoor that was also used as another
channel of accessing the infected systems, in addition
to BlackEnergy.
We continue to monitor the BlackEnergy malware
operations for future developments. For any inquiries
or to make sample submissions related to the subject,

Once activated, variants of BlackEnergy Lite allow a
malware operator to check specific criteria in order to
assess whether the infected computer truly belongs to
the intended target. If that is the case, the dropper of a
regular BlackEnergy variant is pushed to the system.
The exact mechanism of infection by BlackEnergy is
described in our Virus Bulletin presentation and this
whitepaper by F-Secure.
The BlackEnergy malware stores XML configuration
data embedded in the binary of DLL payload.

Figure 1 – The BlackEnergy configuration example used in 2015

Apart from a list of C&C servers, the BlackEnergy
config contains a value called build_id. This value is a
unique text string used to identify individual infections
or infection attempts by the BlackEnergy malware

operators. The combinations of letters and numbers
used can sometimes reveal information about the
campaign and targets.
Here is the list of Build ID values that we identified in
2015:
2015en
khm10
khelm
2015telsmi
2015ts
2015stb
kiev_o
brd2015
11131526kbp
02260517ee
03150618aaa
11131526trk
We can speculate that some of them have a special
meaning. For example 2015telsmi could contain the
Russian acronym SMI – Sredstva Massovoj Informacii,
2015en could mean Energy, and there’s also the obvious
“Kiev”.

KillDisk component
In 2014 some variants of the BlackEnergy trojan
contained a plugin designed for the destruction of the
infected system, named dstr.
In 2015 the BlackEnergy group started to use a new
destructive BlackEnergy component detected by ESET
products as Win32/KillDisk.NBB,
Win32/KillDisk.NBC and Win32/KillDisk.NBD trojan
variants.
The main purpose of this component is to do damage to
data stored on the computer: it overwrites documents
with random data and makes the OS unbootable.
The first known case where the KillDisk component of
BlackEnergy was used was documented by CERT-UA in
November 2015. In that instance, a number of news
media companies were attacked at the time of the 2015
Ukrainian local elections. The report claims that a
large number of video materials and various
documents were destroyed as a result of the attack.

It should be noted that the Win32/KillDisk.NBB
variant used against media companies is more focused
on destroying various types of files and documents. It
has a long list of file extensions that it tries to
overwrite and delete. The complete list contains more
than 4000 file extensions.

Figure 2 – A partial list of file extensions targeted for destruction by
KillDisk.NBB

The KillDisk component used in attacks against energy
companies in Ukraine was slightly different. Our
analysis of the samples shows that the main changes
made in the newest version are:
Now it accepts a command line argument, to set a
specific time delay when the destructive payload
should activate.
It also deletes Windows Event Logs : Application,
Security, Setup, System.
It is less focused on deleting documents. Only 35
file extensions are targeted.

KillDisk component

As well as being able to delete system files to make the
system unbootable – functionality typical for such
destructive trojans – the KillDisk variant detected in
the electricity distribution companies also appears to
contain some additional functionality specifically
intended to sabotage industrial systems.
Once activated, this variant of the KillDisk component
looks for and terminates two non-standard processes
with the following names:
komut.exe
sec_service.exe
We didn’t manage to find any information regarding
the name of the first process (komut.exe).
The second process name may belong to software
called ASEM Ubiquity, a software platform that is often
used in Industrial control systems (ICS), or to
ELTIMA Serial to Ethernet Connector. In case the

process is found, the malware does not just terminate
it, but also overwrites the executable file with random
data.

Backdoored SSH server
In addition to the malware families already mentioned,
we have discovered an interesting sample used by the
BlackEnergy group. During our investigation of one of
the compromised servers we found an application that,
at first glance, appeared to be a legitimate SSH server
called Dropbear SSH.
In the order to run the SSH server, the attackers
created a VBS file with the following content:
Set WshShell = CreateObject(“WScript.Shell”)
WshShell.CurrentDirectory =
“C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\Dropbear\”
WshShell.Run “dropbear.exe -r rsa -d dss -a -p 6789″, 0,
false
As is evident here, the SSH server will accept
connections on port number 6789. By running SSH on
the server in a compromised network, attackers can

come back to the network whenever they want.
However, for some reason this was not enough for
them. After detailed analysis we discovered that the
binary of the SSH server actually contains a backdoor.

Figure 4 – Backdoored authentication function in SSH server

As you can see in Figure 4, this version of Dropbear
SSH will authenticate the user if the password
passDs5Bu9Te7 was entered. The same situation
applies to authentication by key pair – the server

contains a pre-defined constant public key and it
allows authentication only if a particular private key is
used.

ESET security solutions detect this threat as
Win32/SSHBearDoor.A trojan.
