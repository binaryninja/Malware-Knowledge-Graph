Eric Loui - Josh Reynolds

August 30, 2021

Throughout 2020, CARBON SPIDER dramatically overhauled their operations. In April 2020,
the adversary abruptly shifted from narrow campaigns focused entirely on companies
operating point-of-sale (POS) devices to broad, indiscriminate operations that attempted to
infect very many victims across all sectors. The goal of these campaigns was to conduct big
game hunting (BGH) operations using PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil ransomware.
CARBON SPIDER deepened their commitment to BGH in August 2020 by using their own
ransomware, Darkside. In November 2020, the adversary took another step into the world of
BGH by establishing a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program for Darkside,
allowing other actors to use the ransomware while paying CARBON SPIDER a portion of the
ransom received.
Part One of this two-part blog series details how CrowdStrike Intelligence attributed Darkside
to CARBON SPIDER. Part Two will look at CARBON SPIDER’s re-emergence after the
Colonial Pipeline attack, which led to the shutdown of Darkside RaaS and the creation of
BlackMatter RaaS.

Background
CARBON SPIDER, commonly referred to as FIN7 and active since 2013, is one of the oldest
continuously operating eCrime groups. Between 2015 and 2020, the adversary conducted
low-volume campaigns targeting company POS devices, primarily in the hospitality sector.
These campaigns featured a variety of malware, including the Sekur (Carbanak) RAT, VB
Flash, Bateleur and Harpy (GRIFFON). Using POS malware, including PILLOWMINT, the
adversary harvested credit card track data and sold this data on criminal forums such as
Joker’s Stash.

April 2020: Target Scope Widens
In April 2020, CARBON SPIDER abruptly shifted from narrow campaigns focused entirely on
companies operating POS devices to broad, indiscriminate operations that attempted to
infect large numbers of victims across all sectors. The first of these occurred on April 14,
2020, when the adversary likely compromised a legitimate email distribution service to
conduct a broad spam campaign targeting thousands of recipients across numerous
verticals.
This campaign used malicious links that led to a ZIP archive hosted on
https[:]//colahasch[.]com/portal/app/CommerceNetwork/
view/9b25068f2941618fb9b08d6d089a47faae552c93f The ZIP archive contained a Leo

VBS, which refers to a family of obfuscated scripts that download and execute a remote
payload.
The Leo VBS performs an HTTP GET request to
https[:]//alphalanding[.]com/successfully/warranty.eml?uid= and writes a JSS

Loader binary to %TEMP%\PaintHelper.exe . JSS Loader, which has both .NET and C++
versions, has multiple capabilities, including the ability to load additional executables,
PowerShell (PS) and JavaScript (JS) files.
The observed JSS Loader infection led to the download and execution of a setup VBScript
from https[:]//petshopbook[.]com . This script installs a custom Sekur PS stager to
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsDefender\ClearTemp.ps1 and establishes
persistence for this stager with a second VBS that is launched by a scheduled task.
Since this campaign, CARBON SPIDER has maintained an opportunistic target scope, using
phishing attachments and links to deliver Harpy, Leo VBS, JSS Loader, Domenus VBS and
Domenus JS. Domenus VBS and JS are backdoors (written in VBS and JS, respectively)
that enumerate a variety of system information, capture screenshots and browser history,
and can download secondary payloads from a command-and-control (C2) server. Secondary
payloads can include JS, Portable Executables (PEs), DLLs and PS scripts.

2/7

CrowdStrike Intelligence observed numerous Domenus VBS/JS phishing campaigns that
made use of compromised and legitimate services to host Domenus toolchain payloads,
including compromised WordPress installations, compromised SharePoint services,
compromised web servers and Google Docs.

REvil Ransomware Campaigns
On April 28, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a Domenus VBS distribution campaign
that used a spear-phishing email containing a Google Docs link. The resulting Google Docs
page contained a second link that, when clicked, directed the user to
https[:]//chauvinistable[.]com/perfsecure , ultimately redirecting to a compromised
SharePoint site. Here, the victim encountered a ZIP file containing a Domenus VBS file that,
once opened, downloaded and executed Harpy from
https[:]//electroncador[.]com/info .
The redirect URL provided from the Google Docs page
https[:]//chauvinistable[.]com/perfsecure was hosted on the same IP address
( 185.163.45[.]249 ) resolving to a domain used by multiple Cobalt Strike samples sharing
key configuration metadata with Cobalt Strike samples used in several REvil incidents.
These Cobalt Strike samples were also observed in tandem with the custom PowerShell
stager for Sekur. Separate reporting by Symantec further indicated that similar Cobalt Strike
samples were used in campaigns delivering REvil. Based on these multiple overlaps,
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that CARBON SPIDER was
responsible for certain REvil campaigns, likely stemming from JSS Loader or Domenus
VBS/JS infections.

Darkside Ransomware Campaigns + RaaS
On July 1, 2020, CARBON SPIDER sent a phishing email with the subject “Notification:
Package Status Fail.” The email purports to be from a customer who received an email from
the U.S.-based delivery company UPS (Figures 1 and 2). The message body attempts to
impersonate a UPS notification, but contains several grammar errors and non-idiomatic
terms (e.g., “waybill”).

The link “Check” led to a Google Docs page, which contained a link that redirected to a ZIP
file. The ZIP file was hosted on a likely compromised SharePoint account and contained
Domenus VBS, which downloads Harpy from https[:]//fashionableeder[.]com/info .
At one victim, CARBON SPIDER subsequently deployed the aforementioned custom PS
Sekur stager and profiled the Active Directory environment using the utility ADFind.
In this incident, CARBON SPIDER also used the KillACK PS backdoor, executing the
malware using both PowerShell and PowerShell ISE. KillACK sends host information to a C2
server (in this case, againcome[.]com or besaintegration[.]com ) and executes
provided PS script blocks. Multiple KillACK modules have been observed by CrowdStrike
Intelligence, including modules for conducting self-propagation and AMSI hot-patching, as
well as for executing Cobalt Strike stagers and enumerating network information.

4/7

On Aug. 9, 2020, CARBON SPIDER attempted to run the Darkside ransomware with the
filename sleep.exe . This filename may reflect an attempt to masquerade as the legitimate
Windows executable with the same name.
Following this incident, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified numerous similar Darkside
campaigns featuring distinctive CARBON SPIDER tooling, including Harpy, Domenus
VBS/JS, KillACK and Sekur. The adversary also used the commodity Cobalt Strike
framework and Plink tunneling tool in many of these campaigns. After achieving initial
access, the adversary consistently seeks to harvest valid administrative credentials to enable
lateral movement and uses a variety of tools and techniques for this purpose, including
CrackMapExec, Kerberoasting, Mimikatz, PowerSploit and SessionGopher. In one incident,
the adversary likely exploited the ZeroLogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) against a
domain controller.
Using valid credentials, CARBON SPIDER moves laterally through victim environments
using RDP and occasionally SSH. The adversary typically uses PS to run Cobalt Strike but
occasionally writes Cobalt Strike stagers or KillACK backdoors to disk. Occasionally,
CARBON SPIDER has deployed the legitimate GoToAssist or TightVNC tools to provide
redundant control of hosts.
Similar to many other ransomware operators, CARBON SPIDER not only encrypted victim
files using Darkside, but also exfiltrated data for publication on a dedicated leak site (DLS)
hosted on Tor. For exfiltration, CARBON SPIDER primarily leveraged the MEGASync client
for hosting provider MEGA but also employed GoToAssist. Further, CARBON SPIDER
frequently conducted hypervisor jackpotting by encrypting ESXi servers using a version of
Darkside specifically designed for ESXi.
On Nov. 10, 2020, CARBON SPIDER announced the establishment of the Darkside RaaS
affiliate program. The announcement, posted on two major Russian-language forums, states
that the operators of Darkside are looking for Russian-speaking affiliates who understand
how to recognize and delete backups. On Nov. 11, 2020, CARBON SPIDER added a new
message to their DLS concerning the new affiliate program. This announcement claims “we
created the perfect product for ourselves,” indicating that Darkside was originally exclusive to
one group and not shared.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that Darkside ransomware campaigns prior to this
announcement were likely conducted by CARBON SPIDER, and that CARBON SPIDER was
responsible for creating Darkside and introducing the RaaS affiliate program. This
assessment carries moderate confidence, based on:
Multiple separate Darkside incidents attributable to CARBON SPIDER
Low overall volume of Darkside campaigns
The Nov. 11, 2020 announcement described above indicating Darkside was initially
exclusive to one group
5/7

The Oct. 10, 2020 press release indicating Darkside is operated by a single group
Subsequent to the creation of the Darkside RaaS program, CrowdStrike Intelligence
continued to observe some Darkside campaigns almost certainly conducted by CARBON
SPIDER — in addition to other campaigns operated by affiliates — featuring divergent
tooling and TTPs. CARBON SPIDER’s campaigns featured the malware discussed above, in
addition to heavy use of the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation framework.

Conclusion
CARBON SPIDER’s shift from POS malware to BGH ransomware attacks exemplifies a
broader trend in the eCrime landscape. Numerous adversaries that previously relied on
banking trojans (e.g., INDRIK SPIDER) or POS compromises (e.g., GRACEFUL SPIDER)
have almost entirely reinvented themselves to focus on ransomware, reflecting how lucrative
BGH campaigns are. Until the economics of cybercrime fundamentally change, it is unlikely
these adversaries will alter their behavior.

Explanation of Confidence Rating
High Confidence: Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple
sources. High confidence in the quality and quantity of source information supporting a
judgment does not imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The
judgment still has a marginal probability of being inaccurate.

6/7

Moderate Confidence: Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced
and plausible, but not of sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a
higher level of confidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments
carry an increased probability of being incorrect until more information is available or
corroborated.
Low Confidence: Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain,
the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic
inferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for
corroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.
