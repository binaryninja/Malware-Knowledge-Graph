A new ransomware operation named Mount Locker is underway stealing victims' files
before encrypting and then demanding multi-million dollar ransoms.
Starting around the end of July 2020, Mount Locker began breaching corporate networks
and deploying their ransomware.
From ransom notes shared with BleepingComputer by victims, the Mount Locker gang is
demanding multi-million dollar ransom payments in some cases.

$2 million ransom demand from Mount Locker
Before encrypting files, Mount Locker will also steal unencrypted files and threaten victims
that the data will be published if a ransom is not paid.
For example, Mount Locker told one victim that they stole 400 GB of their data, and if they
are not paid, they will contact the victim's competitors, the media, TV channels, and
newspapers.
Ultimately, the victim did not pay, and their data was published to a ransomware data leak
site.

Mount Locker data leak site
This data leak site currently lists four victims, with only one having files leaked.

The MountLocker ransomware
It was only until recently that MalwareHunterTeam discovered a sample of Mount Locker,
which allow allowed us to get a bit more insight into how the ransomware operates.
Michael Gillespie, who analyzed the ransomware, told BleepingComputer that Mount
Locker uses ChaCha20 to encrypt the files and an embedded RSA-2048 public key to
encrypt the encryption key.
From our analysis, when encrypting files, the ransomware will add an extension in the
format .ReadManual.ID. For example, 1.doc would be encrypted and renamed to
1.doc.ReadManual.C77BFF8C, as shown in the encrypted folder below.

Mount Locker encrypted files
The ransomware will then register the extension in the Registry so that when you click on
an encrypted file, it will automatically load the ransom note.
HKCU\Software\Classes\.C77BFF8C\shell\Open\command\ @="explorer.exe
RecoveryManual.html"

The ransom note is named RecoveryManual.html and contains instructions on how to
access the Tor site to communicate with the ransomware operators.

Mount Locker ransom note
The Tor site is simply a chat service, where victims can negotiate the ransom or ask
questions.
Unfortunately, the ransomware is secure, and there is no way to recover your files for free.
