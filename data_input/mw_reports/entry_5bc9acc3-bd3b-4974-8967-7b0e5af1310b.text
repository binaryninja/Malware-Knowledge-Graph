APT

A new APT campaign called Regin targets the usual victims plus a prestigious cryptographer
and the GSM standard on which most cellular communications occur.

Nearly every organization involved in the business of tracking advanced persistent threat
campaigns is talking about a new highly sophisticated attack platform called “Regin”
(pronounced: reɪ*ɡən – like the former U.S. president). The general consensus is that Regin
is the work of a well-funded nation-state, though it’s impossible to point a finger at any
particular country and blame them with certainty.
It would appear as though a number of individuals and organizations had been keeping
dossiers on Regin, because as soon as Symantec issued their first version of the report over
the weekend, other reports began streaming out, adding to the initial findings. More than one
company and more than one researcher – including Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and
Analysis Team – have called this the most sophisticated attack campaign ever analyzed.

According to Kaspersky Lab’s findings, the Regin APT campaign targets telecom operators,
government institutions, multi-national political bodies, financial and research institutions and
individuals involved in advanced mathematics and cryptography. The attackers seem to be
primarily interested in gathering intelligence and facilitating other types of attacks. While
much of the intelligence gathered includes spying on emails and documents, the attack
group also relentlessly targets telecommunication companies, which is normal, and at least
one GSM provider, which is not so normal.
GSM stands for Global System for Mobile Communications. It’s a standard for cellular
communications between mobile phones. The best way to think of GSM is as the second
generation (2G) of mobile communication technologies—the predecessor of 3G and 4G
networks. However, according to reports, GSM is the default standard for mobile networks
used by the majority of telecoms. It’s available in more than 219 countries and territories and
it demands a 90 percent share of the mobile telecom market.
They could have had access to information about which calls are processed by a particular
cell, then redirected these calls to other cells, activated neighbor cells and performed other
offensive activities.
“The ability of this group to penetrate and monitor GSM networks is perhaps the most
unusual and interesting aspect of these operations,” Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and
Analysis Team reported yesterday. “In today’s world, we have become too dependent on
mobile phone networks which rely on ancient communication protocols with little or no
security available for the end user. Although all GSM networks have mechanisms embedded
which allow entities such as law enforcement to track suspects, there are other parties which
can gain this ability and further abuse them in order to launch other types of attacks against
mobile users.”

The attackers were able to steal credentials from an internal GSM Base Station Controller
belonging to a large telecom operator that gave them access to GSM cells in that particular
network, Kaspersky Lab said. My Threatpost colleague, Mike Mimoso, noted that Base
Station Controllers manage calls as they move along a mobile network, allocating resources
and mobile data transfers.
“This means that they could have had access to information about which calls are processed
by a particular cell, redirected these calls to other cells, activated neighbor cells and
performed other offensive activities,” Kaspersky Lab researchers wrote. “At the present time,
the attackers behind Regin are the only ones known to have been capable of preforming
such operations.”
In other words, the Regin actors can not only passively monitor cellular communications
metadata, but they can also actively reroute cellular calls from one number to another.

Another bizarre and curious aspect of the Regin attack group is the story of a famed Belgian
cryptographer and mathematician named Jean-Jacques Quisquater. In February of this year,
reports began emerging that Quisquater’s personal computer had been hacked six months
earlier. While it isn’t unusual for prominent academics to be targeted in cyberattacks, the
case of Quisquater was slightly different because of some similarities between the attack that
targeted his machine and a separate attack that targeted the Belgian telecom, Belgacom.
The latter incident was the subject of an Edward Snowden revelation claiming that the NSA
and its British counterpart, GCHQ, had orchestrated the attack. Of course, many media
outlets have alleged that these similarities do suggest that U.S. and British intelligence were
behind both attacks. While neither Kaspersky Daily nor Kaspersky Lab will cosign those
allegations, it was reported by a number of news outlets at the time and is worth mentioning.
In addition to the story of Quisquater and the fact that it targets GSMs, the Regin attack
platform also boasts incredible technical sophistication, particularly in its pervasiveness. The
attackers established backdoors with their command infrastructure to ensure inconspicuous
persistence on the networks of their victims. All of the campaign’s communication traffic was
encrypted to make sure attacks weren’t observed, both between the attackers and their
control servers and between the victim’s machines and the attack infrastructure.

Most of Regin’s communications occur between infected machines – dubbed
‘communication drones’ – on the victim’s network. The reason for this is twofold: it allows for
deep access while also limiting the amount of data exiting the network en route to a
command and control server. When you see data leaving your network and traveling to an
unknown network, that raises alarms. So this in-network, peer-to-peer communication makes
it more difficult for network monitors to realize an attack is occurring.

In one unnamed Middle Eastern country, every single victimized network identified by
Kaspersky lab, communicates with all of the other networks in a sort of peer-to-peer
structure. The network included the president’s office, a research center, an educational
institution’s network and a bank. One of the victims contains a translation drone that is able
to forward the stolen data packets outside of the country, to the command and control server
located in India.
“This represents a rather interesting command-and-control mechanism, which is guaranteed
to raise very few suspicions,” researchers wrote. “For instance, if all commands to the
president’s office are sent through the bank’s network, then all of the malicious traffic that is
visible to the president’s office’s sysadmins will only be with the bank, in the same country.”
Regin is deployed in five stages, giving the attackers deep access to a victimized network as
each stage loads subsequent parts of the attack. Modules in the first stage contain the only
executable stored on the victim’s computer, and they’re all signed with phony Microsoft and
Broadcom digital certificates in order to seem legitimate.

4/5

Kaspersky products detect modules from the Regin platform as: Trojan.Win32.Regin.gen and
Rootkit.Win32.Regin. Kaspersky Lab has also released a full-length technical paper if you
would like to dig a bit deeper.
