Mobile beasts and where to find them — part one: Adware, subscribers, flooders,
DDoSers.
Mobile beasts and where to find them — part two: Ransomware, wipers, miners.
Mobile beasts and where to find them — part three: Spyware, keyloggers, banking
Trojans.

In part four of our study of mobile threats, we discuss the most complex and dangerous
types of malware — the ones that not only exploit Android capabilities, but are also able to
tune your system to their taste and combine multiple malicious functions.

RATs — remote access Trojans
RAT by name, rat by nature. Remote administration tools (RATs) can be used to connect to a
remote device on the network and not only view the screen contents, but also take full
control, issuing commands from remote input devices (keyboard/mouse on a computer;
touch screen on a smartphone).
RATs were initially created with good intentions — to help manage various settings and apps,
well, remotely. After all, it is far easier for tech support staff to select the right check boxes
and settings themselves rather than trying to explain to the user what to do over the phone
— and even easier for the user.
But in cybercriminals’ hands, RATs are transformed into a formidable weapon: Installing a
Trojan on your smartphone that provides someone with remote access to the gadget is like
giving the keys to your apartment to a stranger. The malicious use of RATs is so common
that the acronym increasingly stands for “remote access Trojan.”
Having connected to your device through a RAT, hackers can do as they please, including
snooping on all your passwords and PINs, logging into banking apps and transferring your
money, and subscribing you to unwanted services that quietly eat up funds on your mobile
account or credit card — as well as stealing your mail, social network, and IM accounts to
extract money from friends in your name. And that’s after copying all your photos to
blackmail you later if any of them happen to be of a private nature.
Typically, RATs are used for spying. Such malware allows jealous husbands or wives to spy
on their spouses, but more seriously, it can also be used for stealing corporate secrets. For
example, AndroRAT (detected in spring this year) sneakily takes pictures with the
smartphone camera and records sound (including telephone conversations). It also steals
Wi-Fi passwords based on geolocation. This means that no negotiations are ever
confidential, and it makes penetrating the office network a piece of cake.

Rooting Trojans
“Root access” in some operating systems, including Android, is another name for superuser
rights, which allow changes to system folders and files. For regular user tasks, such access
is completely unnecessary and disabled by default. But some advanced enthusiasts like to
have it to customize the operating system. See our post Rooting your Android: Advantages,
disadvantages, and snags to learn why you should think twice before doing so.

Some malicious programs, called rooting Trojans, can get root privileges using vulnerabilities
in the operating system. Having superuser rights allows cybercriminals to configure your
smartphone for their purposes. For example, they can force the device to open full-screen
ads. Or install malware or adware in the background, without any notifications.
A favorite rooting malware trick is to secretly delete apps installed on the smartphone and
replace them with either phishing or malware-augmented software. Moreover, superuser
rights can be used to prevent you from removing malware from your device. No wonder that
rooting Trojans are considered today’s most dangerous type of mobile threat.

Modular Trojans
Jack-of-all-trades modular Trojans can perform several different malicious actions, either
simultaneously or selectively according to the situation. One of the most striking examples of
such a Trojan is Loapi, detected in late 2017. As soon as it penetrates a victim’s device, it
immediately ensures its own safety by requesting administrator rights — and it won’t take no
for an answer; if it is refused, the dialog window pops up again and again, preventing the
smartphone from being used. And if access is granted, it becomes impossible to remove
Loapi from the device.
The Trojan then launches any one of five modules. It can display ads, subscribe the user to
paid content by following links, carry out DDoS attacks on command from a remote server,
and forward SMS messages to cybercriminals, concealing them so that the user does not
notice malicious transactions.
And in its spare time, when not engaged with these important tasks, the Trojan stealthily
mines cryptocurrency, most often when the smartphone is connected to a power outlet or
external battery. Mining is a complex computational process that gobbles up energy and
resources, so the battery takes a very long time to charge. This can have fatal consequences
for phones: Our experts discovered firsthand that a couple of days of Loapi activity is enough
to ruin a smartphone battery through overheating.

How to defend against the worst Android malware
As you can see, the dangers posed by RATs, rooting Trojans, and modular malware are
serious. But you can guard against them. Here are some simple rules:
First of all, block app installs from unknown sources. This option is disabled in Android
by default, and it should stay that way. It is no panacea, but it does solve most
problems associated with mobile Trojans.
Do not try to skimp by downloading hacked versions of apps. Many of them are
infected.

3/4

Do not click on links promising the moon. WhatsApp offers of free airline tickets are
usually just an attempt to steal your personal data, and they download malware to your
smartphone as a bonus. The same applies to phishing, including texts from friends or
strangers containing “Is this your photo?”-type messages.
Do not ignore updates for Android and apps installed on your device. Updates patch
holes through which attackers can sneak into your smartphone.
Check what rights apps are asking for, and do not be afraid to refuse access to
personal information and potentially dangerous functions in Android — in most cases,
nothing terrible will happen if such requests are denied.
Put a good antivirus on your smartphone. For example, Kaspersky Internet Security for
Android not only finds and removes Trojans, but also blocks websites with malware and
mobile subscriptions.
