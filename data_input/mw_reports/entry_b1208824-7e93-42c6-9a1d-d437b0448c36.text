Codi Starks, Kevin Finnigin

Following patches released by Microsoft on August 11th, 2020, adversaries are continuing
to exploit CVE-2020-1472, known as the ZeroLogon vulnerability. The vulnerability affects
Microsoft’s Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC), a critical authentication mechanism
used by Microsoft® Active Directory®. Successful exploitation can allow for escalation of
privileges and ultimately full domain takeover[i].
The BlackBerry Incident Response (IR) team is closely monitoring exploitation of the
vulnerability and has seen instances of the exploit used by threat groups to deploy
ransomware. With the growing exploitation of the ZeroLogon vulnerability, it’s important to
understand how to mitigate the vulnerability and detect if you’ve been impacted by it.
To explain how threat actors are leveraging the vulnerability, we’ll walk through a recent
Netwalker ransomware incident handled by the BlackBerry IR team.

Pre-Exploit Activities

1/6

Before diving into the incident, let’s cover some pre-exploit activities that are shared among
many ransomware cases. Before a threat actor can begin to escalate privileges via
ZeroLogon, they first need to establish a foothold on the network. BlackBerry has observed
that misconfigured or unpatched network perimeter devices, such as firewalls and VPN
appliances, continue to be the primary methods used to gain entry into the network. After
establishing the initial foothold, there will typically be enumeration and scanning activity that
occurs to create a map of the network.
The threat actor may then begin testing access to various systems via RDP or SMB in order
to identify a system to pivot further into the network to target critical systems. These initial
actions are seen frequently in ransomware incidents that the BlackBerry IR team responds
to, and are not unique to the case discussed below.

The ZeroLogon Netwalker Case
Now that we’ve covered some common methods used to establish an initial foothold, we’ll
cover a true ransomware case where the ZeroLogon exploit was used to escalate
privileges, prior to deploying Netwalker ransomware. Some critical Windows Event IDs used
to detect ZeroLogon exploitation, including 4624 and 4742, were not available on the
endpoint for the incident timeframe. Evidence of exploitation was still available on the
source and destination devices, as discussed below.
BlackBerry initially discovered the first evidence of ZeroLogon exploitation through a
suspicious authentication event to a Domain Controller. On the source device, Windows
Event ID 4648 was logged displaying the process name used to connect to the remote
system.

Upon discovering the suspicious connection, the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence
Team reverse engineered the file ‘zero.exe’ and determined it to be a custom developed
ZeroLogon exploit binary. Once executed, the file is designed to run the exploit against a
targeted Domain Controller, reset the Domain Controller’s device password, extract the

2/6

NTLM hash of a user specified via a command line argument, and if desired, run arbitrary
commands on the destination host. BlackBerry’s testing confirmed these capabilities, as
seen below.

Upon exploitation of the ZeroLogon vulnerability, the binary was configured to create a
service with an arbitrary name of exactly 20 characters, which was used to reset the
Domain Controller’s machine password to its original state to avoid breaking authentication
to/from the server. As the computer account is typically only reset every 30 days, seeing
two resets in a short period of time would be a possible indicator of compromise (IOC) for
the ZeroLogon exploit. BlackBerry discovered Windows Event ID 7045 logged on the
Domain Controller, indicating a new service was installed, showing further evidence of the
exploitation event:

At the same time the Domain Controller began logging Event ID 5805 with a “Computer”
parameter containing the Domain Controller’s own device name. These events are used to
indicate failed netlogon authentication events, and begin occurring once the Domain
Controller’s password has been changed via the ZeroLogon exploit. The events indicate the
machine can no longer successfully authenticate using the expected credentials.

3/6

At this point, the threat actor successfully restored the Domain Controller’s credentials to
avoid detection. Additionally, the exploit allowed the attacker to obtain the NTLM hash for a
Domain Administrator account. Next, the threat actor remotely created a user account on
the Domain Controller using the NTLM hash of the Domain Administrator account harvested
by the ‘zero.exe’ exploit. The popular ‘Invoke-TheHash’ powershell script was used to passthe-hash and execute the account creation commands on the Domain Controller, similar to
the command below:

Once the local account was created, the threat actor connected to the Domain Controller
via RDP and used the mimikatz tool to harvest additional credentials on the Domain
Controller. This was seen via the presence of the ‘C:\Users\
<username>\Downloads\mimikatz.log’ file. At this point it was trivial for the threat actor to
move laterally and deploy ransomware across additional network systems.

Hunting and Remediation
Patch management is the best method to prevent the exploitation of the ZeroLogon
vulnerability, although there are cases where patching in a timely manner is simply not
possible. In these cases, organizations should be aware of the impact of a successful
exploitation event and its detection with what may be minimal log data. Learn more about
the importance of patching along with recommendations for creating a robust vulnerability
management program in our article examining critical behaviors that either stop incidents
from happening or greatly reduce their impact.
Although in this case the end goal was a highly visible ransomware incident, it is possible
that APT threat groups may have used or be using similar techniques for more covert and
insidious campaigns. Understanding if you were already compromised prior to patching may
be advisable. For assistance with determining this, reach out to your trusted security
provider.
BlackBerry identified several IOCs that can be used to identify signs of ZeroLogon
exploitation:
Windows Event ID 4648 with a suspicious file name/path.

4/6

Windows Event ID 7045 (Service Creation) with an Image Path of “Powershell -c
Reset-ComputerMachinePassword”
Multiple password resets for computer accounts, in particular, for the domain
controller within a short space of time
A large number of Windows Event ID 5805 events containing the Domain Controllers
computer name, especially if seen in close relation with Event ID 7045.
