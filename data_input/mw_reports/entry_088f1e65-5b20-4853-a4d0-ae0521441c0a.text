The Cofense PDC has been tracking a stealthy malware campaign that has recently become
more active compromising enterprise endpoints. The campaign, first observed in midDecember, carries pharmaceutical-themed invoices that contain references to a series of
websites hosted on the “shop” domain but that were down at the time of initial analysis. They
were classified by the PDC as malicious because of the phone numbers used on
the invoices. These numbers were identical across invoices being sent in from different
brands and senders, which meant these are likely coordinated. The main lures of the emails
also revolved around contacting the phone number instead of visiting the site.

Figure 1: Email Body
New waves of the phishing emails are now being sent overnight with new brands ranging
from office supplies, rose delivery and lingerie. After monitoring certain internet
sources, PDC analysts were able to pull up the referenced sites while they were still live.
Following an involved process of interacting with the site to request a cancellation form, a
malicious Excel document was finally retrieved. This infection was the first stage of
the BazarBackdoor malware.
The invoice ruse bypassed various customer SEGs because the email had
no malicious payload and could be seen as a simple phishing scam. Only a handful of
recipients would think to browse to the invoice site and search for a way to cancel their order
without calling the number provided.

Figure 2: Invoice Attachment
While the invoices use a basic template, they look just professional enough that
an inquisitive recipient might check the site to see if it’s legitimate. Invoices for the older
campaigns would be named after the order number, but recent campaigns are utilizing a
“invoice_*.pdf” format, where the star (*) wildcard is the order number.

It has been observed that the next stage in this social engineering attack alternates between
being located on the contact, FAQ and refund pages of the website.

If the order number is entered, the recipient will be transferred to a new website with a “.us”
domain version of the prior website. There are several variations of the site, for instance
using hyphens to break up the words or using only the first and third words of the fictitious
brand. Examples of this would be compact-ssd[.]us and compactstorage[.]us.

Figure 4: Download Page
Once the site is loaded, a series of images walks the user through downloading a form to
cancel their order. There is a link to the request form, and a link to an email where the form is
to be sent. This furthers the ruse’s legitimacy. The downloaded form is
an Excel document that appears to be encrypted by DocuSign.

Figure 5: Excel Template
This Excel template is themed similarly to a Trickbot template reported on Twitter
by @ffforward, who has been tracking the campaign closely. This connection makes sense
considering the agreement in many quarters that there is a connection between Trickbot
operators and the group behind BazarBackdoor.
When the form is activated, an .EXE payload is immediately launched. This executable is
also a new variant of BazarBackdoor. It will reload itself into memory several times before
the command-and-controls (C2s) can finally be extracted. Next, the executable queries the
geographical location and IP address of the infected machine. This is a common tactic that
usually ensures that the threat actor does not infect machines in their country of operation.

Figure 6: Bazar in Memory Strings
After the .EXE finishes loading, we see BazarBackdoor domains in the memory strings.

Figure 7: C2s for Bazarbackdoor
We also can find this campaign’s C2 for dropping the next stage by searching for IP
addresses in the strings. There is often a common word in the C2s, such as “cleaner” or
“book” or “snow” that differentiates between campaigns. In the observed campaign for
this article, that word is “round_table”.

Figure 8: DNS traffic
An analysis of the machine’s network traffic reveals that DNS requests are being sent
by BazarBackdoor. This is a common technique the malware employs to mask the servers
behind the “bazar” domains. The TCP connections to the three “round_table” servers will
drop a data file that is likely part of the next stage.
Recent invoice templates have shifted from using the “.shop” domain to “.net” domains. This
campaign was also referred to as “BazarCall” by @ffforward. It is widely believed that this
campaign, like prior BazarBackdoor campaigns, will distribute Ryuk ransomware across the
network. An analysis by The DFIR Report found Cobalt strike beacons in their
environment, and PowerShell scripts that are seen in conjunction with Ryuk. However, no
Ryuk was deployed during the analysis.
The Cofense PDC is still looking into the connection between Kontakt Kegtap and the
Bazarloader/Bazarbackdoor campaigns being delivered from Google Docs and
GetResponse.
