Network security operations generally and network security monitoring (NSM) more specifically evolve with
technology like any other information technology (IT) field. One important development in NSM, along with
increasing emphasis on host-centric detection, is the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence
(ML/AI) mechanisms to analyze large, streaming datasets to identify items deviating from normal operations.
Such advances enable security anomaly detection, where a combination of ML/AI and advanced statistics
generate alerts and alarms relevant to an underlying baseline of normal operations.
An anomaly-based approach to network defense and monitoring is very powerful, but the current perspective
of anomaly detection is overly weighted toward statistical and ML/AI modeling techniques. While these items
are expansive and will be increasingly useful as underlying datasets become ever larger, space still exists for
a more classic version of anomaly-driven detection.
In this post, we will examine an expanded conception of anomaly analysis to demonstrate how network
operators and defenders still retain various options for monitoring and protecting their respective
environments using a threat-focused, intelligence-driven approach to NSM and similar alerting.

Anomalies Defined and Reviewed
The idea of an “anomaly” is quite simple: something that deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected.
Based on this general definition, network anomalies would encompass items ranging from a newly resolved
domain, a never-before-seen user agent, or something more exotic such as a mismatch between
communication protocol and standard port assignment.
Yet the idea of anomaly-based defense in NSM and related security disciplines increasingly is linked directly
and exclusively to mathematical models for identifying anomalous trends in a large dataset. While this
approach is certainly valuable and may over time prove to be the only viable approach to dealing with
massive datasets, this technique largely abandons contextuality in favor of mathematical speculation.
ML/AI-derived anomalies represent a deviation from a baseline. Such an approach can be very valuable in
identifying new or unusual traffic, but at the same time such events are confusing as their only reason for
being interesting is their strangeness. Such strangeness can arise for several reasons: misconfiguration, a
change in operations, user error, or potentially malicious operations. Given a black box approach to ML/AI
anomaly identification, contextuality as to why a given item is even relevant — let alone a security concern —
is lost.
Yet if we break free of a strictly mathematical view of potential security anomalies, several possibilities
emerge. Looking at anomalies as more than just a statistical deviation, but as a meaningful, identifiable
alteration from a normal state of affairs allows us to inject context and meaning into the event in question. In

this fashion, differentiating the simply weird from the concerning becomes possible because we can begin
framing unusual events in light of how such an observation relates to pre- and post-event actions and how
such an event may relate to an adversary’s intrusion lifecycle.
In this perspective, an anomaly becomes not just an observation deviating from a long-term baseline, but an
item that represents a change in operations that at the same time can be associated with potential malicious
behaviors. Searching for anomalies thus becomes enriched by understanding and projecting why such an
anomalous, unusual occurrence matters. Such an outlook represents a refinement from a view of the simply
strange to the unusual, and potentially malicious, which reduces our corpus of possible events — but does so
in a way that is useful since it redirects our focus to higher-confidence instances where such unusual events
can be highly correlated with behaviors associated with adversary operations.
What we seek in this perspective is a refinement of anomaly to include observations that incorporate an
understanding of adversary operations. By enriching our understanding of outlier events and anomalous
network occurrences to incorporate cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and similar perspectives, we can drive
higher value and higher confidence alerting on items of interest. Analysts and network defenders can then
devote energy towards exploring and investigating a likely malicious event, rather than focusing on first trying
to determine whether a given occurrence is truly malicious, or merely weird but ultimately benign.

Examples of Network Anomalies for Detection Purposes
The above considerations are not merely theoretical in nature. Rather, adopting a CTI-enriched
understanding of anomalies to incorporate perspectives on adversary operations unlocks powerful detection
possibilities related to known techniques and campaigns. By exploring a few examples of such activity, we
can gain greater understanding of how the concept of an anomaly should be expanded to include detecting
items straying from the usual, but informed by CTI understanding of adversary operations and behaviors.

Sandworm Operations and Mismatches
In June 2020, the U.S. National Security Agency published a report on exploitation activity linked to a threat
actor typically referred to as Sandworm. Subsequent analysis of this campaign revealed various actions
associated with this actor and the specific campaign targeting the Exim mail transfer agent (MTA). Reviewing
analysis of this actor’s activity in this campaign, several mismatches in functionality or expected relationships
emerge:
Use of Windows-specific user agent strings for retrieval of follow-on payloads as part of malicious script
execution in likely Linux system environments
Leveraging standard ports but using uncommon protocols or services on these ports for command and
control (C2) functionality
We observe the former in connection with a post-intrusion script executed by Sandworm:

Figure 1. Post-intrusion

script executed by Sandworm.
An anomalous situation emerges given the nature of communication in the above item. While the Exim MTA
will typically reside only on Linux servers, the script in question uses a hard-coded user agent string
associated with Windows workstations. Identifying this communication anomaly will allow a defender to spot
the C2 channel through the mismatch in system type and traffic information. If sufficient visibility and IT asset
identification exists, defenders can articulate alerts identifying functional mismatches for further investigation
and analysis.

Figure 2. Post-

exploitation Sandworm activity shows mismatch.
In addition to the user agent item, the above section of post-exploitation Sandworm activity shows another
interesting mismatch between expected and observed behavior. In this case, a hard-coded HTTP connection
exists (again using a Windows-based user agent), but instead of using TCP 80 for communication, the
request leverages TCP 53 (typically associated with DNS zone transfers). Such activity could be used to
evade firewall or similar controls (as DNS is typically allowed outbound). But examination of traffic flow
information would show a mismatch between protocol used (HTTP) and associated port (TCP 53). This type
of mismatch would not be randomly occurring and can be highly correlated with evasive activity by an entity
within the network. By detecting such traffic, defenders can identify not merely suspicious but likely malicious
behaviors for further response and investigation.

NOBELIUM and Unusual DNS Queries
Multiple entities identified a complex, long-running intrusion campaign leveraging a supply chain intrusion
through Solar Winds Orion network monitoring software in December 2020. Subsequent analysis, along with
labeling the adversary responsible as NOBELIUM, identified additional intrusion and lateral movement
mechanisms leveraging adversary compromise of Microsoft Cloud and O365 environments. The combination
of Microsoft and Solar Winds vectors for intrusion and access represent a formidable combination for
defenders to deal with — a situation made more complicated still given the adversary’s savvy use of network
infrastructure to evade indicator-driven network defense and investigation.
Examination of the Solar Winds Orion intrusion vector, labeled SUNBURST, reveals one key observable
linking all known events: use of a common initial C2 domain for victim identification and filtering. The domain,
avsvmcloud[.]com, was used to collect lengthy DNS requests, such as the below items observed in

3/7

DomainTools Iris, that contained encoded victim information. Based on this information, the responding server
would then determine whether the victim would receive a CNAME response back to move events on to
second-stage C2 infrastructure.

Figure 3.

avsvmcloud[.]com was used to collect lengthy DNS requests.
While a variety of careful, operations security-centric steps are made by NOBELIUM in establishing this
nested C2 activity, the initial C2 beacon nonetheless stands out while linking first-stage infection vectors.
While detecting anomalous DNS activity (long subdomains, DNS lookups followed by no actual traffic to the
identified resource, etc.) on its own may be insufficient for meaningful alerting, additional enrichment may
enable higher-confidence assessments. For example, linking this DNS activity to the specific device
responsible, such as a Solar Winds Orion network monitoring server, can tie an anomalous network event to
high-profile, high-value infrastructure. Such correlation, in this case based on functionality and context, serves
to bubble up the merely anomalous to activity that requires investigation.

Large Archive Downloads for Analysis Evasion
NOBELIUM-linked activity continued in late May 2021 with a phishing campaign spoofing non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and other entities. For this campaign, the initial infection vector was a malicious link in
the NGO-spoofing email leading to an ISO optical disk image file.
For reasons of efficiency and scalability, ISO file types (which are legitimately used for a number of purposes,
including distributing operating system installation disks) are often excluded from active analysis (scanning
engines or sandboxing) because of their size. For example, a typical Linux installation ISO for Ubuntu is
approximately 2.6 gigabytes in size, while Windows 10 ISO installers are typically larger than 3 gigabytes. To
avoid undue stress on security appliances, such files are therefore exempt from security analysis — allowing
an entity such as NOBELIUM (among other adversaries) to use this visibility gap to transfer malware within
an ISO archive.
As reported by multiple entities, NOBELIUM distributed malware as an ISO with several components inside: a
decoy document or PDF, a DLL containing the actual payload, and a LNK file that would handle execution of
the payload while displaying the decoy. While ISO files can (obviously) be of any size, what is notable about
the images distributed in this campaign is that they are relatively small, as shown in the samples provided in
the following table:

Whereas typical ISOs are often measured in gigabytes, these items at most come in at a little over 20
megabytes. As such, an anomaly can be identified in this behavior: retrieval of relatively small ISO files, and
in this case from likely new (to the victim) network infrastructure. This combination of anomalous observations
— odd file given file type and newly observed network infrastructure — can be used as an identifier for activity
that requires further analysis and investigation.

Context-Driven Anomalies and Enabling Response
A threat-centric, intelligence-driven approach to anomalies also enables response due to greater contextuality
and background understanding of suspicious activity. In identifying an anomalous object given a known,
identifiable behavioral deviation, defenders can now ask relevant questions as to how the observation
manifested and toward what it likely leads. This stands in contrast to the approach in most black-box
mathematical model identifications, where significant effort must first be expended to determine whether the
odd observation is even suspicious (or malicious) before considering what comes next.
Thus, in a behavior-aware, intelligence-driven perspective for identifying anomalies relevant to networknormal behaviors, possibilities emerge for guiding investigation and response post-detection. Frequently
described as playbooks within the security industry, incident response (IR) personnel can leverage predetermined, historically relevant follow-on actions to pursue a detection after it emerges. Since the triggering
anomaly is strange because of context and operation relative to the network and potential adversary actions,
IR actions can be focused toward known-valuable investigative paths.
Enabling IR and defensive operations is a goal for many organizations to better utilize and direct limited
resources. By ensuring an intelligence and contextual perspective for security detections, such as an
enriched identification of anomalies, organizations can meaningfully enable such a posture. In doing so, asset
owners and decision makers create a more focused, rapid response to malicious activity, minimizing
adversary dwell time and improving defender identification and response metrics.

Conclusion
5/7

The concept of a security anomaly has been debased due to the exclusive focus on mathematical and
statistical model identification of odd events in network security as the only perceived manner of implementing
such an approach.
Through reevaluation of the anomaly concept, we find possibilities for contextual, behavior-driven variants
that allow defenders and responders to rapidly triage and transition initial observations toward highconfidence security alerts. By adopting this enriched conception, we as network security professionals can
reclaim the idea of anomalous events from black-box modeling and reintroduce it to fundamental security
monitoring and response. In doing so, we will enable a more focused, more accurate means to respond to
security events as they occur, while significantly reducing wasteful actions in response to events that are
merely odd but fundamentally benign.
