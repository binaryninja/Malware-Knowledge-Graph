COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), Fortra, LLC (“Fortra”), and Health-ISAC,
Inc., (“H-ISAC”) hereby complain and allege that John Does 1-16 (collectively “Defendants”)
have abused the legitimate security testing tool called Cobalt Strike, illegally created cracked
versions of the tool 1, and used the cracked versions for illegal purposes. Cobalt Strike is a
commercial security testing tool made by the company Fortra, LLC. The application functions as
a threat emulation program developed to simulate “Red Team” operations that are designed to
execute targeted attacks and emulate post-exploitation activities of advanced threat actors for the

As used in this action, "cracked versions of Cobalt Strike" refer to stolen, unlicensed, or otherwise unauthorized
versions or copies of Cobalt Strike.

purpose of testing the resilience of an organization’s cyber defenses. Defendants abuse Cobalt
Strike’s capabilities by altering the authentic code to communicate with malicious command and
control infrastructure to engage in illegal activities once a malware infiltrates a victim’s systems.
More specifically, cracked versions of Cobalt Strike allow Defendants to gain control of their
victim’s machine and move laterally through the connected network to find other victims and
install malware. This includes installing ransomware like Conti, LockBit, Quantum Locker, Royal,
Cuba, BlackBasta BlackCat and PlayCrypt, to arrest access to the systems. In essence, Defendants
are able to leverage cracked versions of Cobalt Strike to brutally force their way into victim
machines and deploy malware. Additionally, once the Defendants deploy the malware or
ransomware onto computers running Microsoft’s Window operating system, Defendants are able
to execute a series of actions involving abuse of Microsoft’s copyrighted declaring code. Not only
do Defendants abuse Microsoft’s copyrighted declaring code in connection with their use of
cracked Cobalt Strike, but Defendants further abuse Microsoft’s code when ransomware such as
Conti of LockBit replicate the copyrighted declaring code in connection with executing various
commands, such as terminating services that allow the system to encrypt files, disable real time
monitoring of threats, or uninstalling the Windows Defender application (all which leave the
victims’ computer further vulnerable). Unless enjoined and held accountable, Defendants will
continue to use cracked versions of Cobalt Strike to proliferate malware, including ransomware.
Defendants control the malicious command and control infrastructure leveraging cracked versions
of Cobalt Strike by hosting and operating through the Internet Protocol addresses (“IP Addresses”)
and domains set forth in Appendix A. Plaintiffs allege as follows:
NATURE OF THE ACTION
1.

This is an action based upon: (i) Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems

under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1201, (ii) Copyright Infringement, 17
U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq., (iii) Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030, (iv) Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701, (v) False Designation of Origin under the Lanham
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), (vi) Trademark Infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114
et seq., (vii) Trademark Dilution under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c), (viii) Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1962, (ix) Conspiracy to Violate the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) – 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), (x) Trespass
to Chattels, (xi) Conversion, and (xii) Unjust Enrichment. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and other
equitable relief and damages against Defendants who operate and control the command and control
infrastructure leveraging cracked versions of Cobalt Strike. Defendants, through their illegal
activities involving cracked Cobalt Strike, have caused and continue to cause irreparable injury to
Plaintiffs, their customers, members, and the public.

One of the pillars of Microsoft’s comprehensive portfolio of software programs is

its Microsoft Windows operating system. Microsoft Windows is a group of proprietary graphical
operating system families. Microsoft also spends considerable time and energy building its
Windows platform and making it available to third-party developers to create programs that are
compatible with Windows. With every Windows release, Microsoft also makes available a
software development kit (“SDK”). The SDK is a package of programming tools including
creative and original APIs, header files, libraries, documentation, code samples, processes, and
guides that developers can use and integrate into their own applications. Microsoft’s SDKs are
required when developing any application, program, or tool for Microsoft Windows. The code at
issue in this case encompasses a type of code called “declarations” within header files and within
libraries contained in the SDK, and referred to in this Complaint as the “Declaring Code.”
30.

and other materials that comprise the Windows operating system, including the Declaring Code.
Microsoft’s Windows SDK copyrights, encompassing the Declaring Code, are registered with the
United States Copyright Office, including those attached as Appendix C.
31.

Microsoft makes its SDK and the code contained within the SDK, including the

Declaring Code, available to the public through a license (“SDK License”). This enables Microsoft
12

to maintain an open platform for third-party developers while preventing malicious actors from
using the code in the SDK, including the Declaring Code, in a harmful way. Any developer who
downloads Microsoft’s SDK tools, including the Declaring Code, must accept the terms of the
SDK License.
32.

Microsoft’s SDK License agreements make clear to end users that they are

acquiring a license to use the software subject to certain limitations around the use of the software
and place certain restrictions, including prohibiting end-users from using certain portions of the
software code, including the header files in the SDK and associated Declaring Code, “in malicious,
deceptive, or unlawful programs.”

OVERVIEW OF LEGITIMATE VERSIONS COBALT STRIKE
35.

Cobalt Strike is a commercial security testing tool made by Plaintiff Fortra LLC.

The application functions as a threat emulation program developed to simulate “Red Team”
operations that are designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate post-exploitation activities of
advanced threat actors for the purpose of testing the resilience of an organization’s cyber defenses.
36.

Cobalt Strike itself is a command and control application with two primary

components: the team server and the client. A team server accepts client connections. The client
is how operators connect to a team server. These two components are contained in a Java
executable file (a “JAR file”). “Beacon” is the name for Cobalt Strike’s default simulated malware
14

payload used to create a connection to the team server. The beacon file contains contact
information such as the command and control IP address or domain, connection port information,
watermark, and encryption keys. Legitimate penetration testers use this application to test whether
an organization’s system would potentially succumb to the infiltration of malware into the
network.
CRACKED VERSIONS OF COBALT STRIKE
37.

Compromised and cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are commonly referred to in

the cybersecurity community as “cracked” versions and often consist of manipulated beacon files
that are programmed to communicate with malicious command and control infrastructure to
engage in illegal activities once a malware infiltrates a victim’s systems. More specifically,
cracked versions of Cobalt Strike allow Defendants to gain control of their victim’s machine and
move laterally through the connected network to find other victims and install malware. This
includes installing ransomware like Conti, LockBit, Quantum Locker, Royal, Cuba, BlackBasta,
BlackCat, and PlayCrypt, to gain access to the systems. In essence, Defendants are able to leverage
cracked versions of Cobalt Strike to brutally force their way into victim machines and deploy
malware.
38.

Cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are distributed in various forums. Typically,

these are the result of someone modifying a trial JAR file to bypass the license check and
rebuilding the JAR file, or by crafting an authorization file with a fake license ID and distributing
that with the JAR file.
COMMAND AND CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE OF CRACKED COBALT STRIKE
39.

Cobalt Strike is the command and control application itself. This has two primary

components: the team server and the client. These are both contained in the same Java executable
15

(“JAR file”) and the only difference is what arguments an operator uses to execute it:
a. First component: Team server (Java component) is the command and control
(“C2”) server portion of Cobalt Strike. It can accept client connections, BEACON callbacks, and
general web requests.
b. Second component: Client (Java Component) is how operators connect to a team
server. Clients can run on the same system as a Team server or connect remotely and can be run
on Windows, macOS, or Linux systems.
40.

Beacon is the name for Cobalt Strike’s default malware payload used to create a

connection to the team server. It is a point for egress and once connected, an encrypted beacon
binary is downloaded from the Cobalt Strike infrastructure. The Cobalt Strike beacon loader is
responsible for downloading, decrypting the beacon binary, injecting code into a Windows
process, and passing the control to the beacon binary. Essentially, when an cracked version of
Cobalt Strike is created, the beacon that is part of the authentic Cobalt Strike tool is manipulated
and repurposed to include in its code, malicious code that allows it to compromise victims’
computers.
41.

The command and control computers are specialized computers and/or software

(“servers”). Defendants purchased or leased these servers and used them to send commands to
control the infected victim computers. The command and control computers send the most
fundamental instructions, modules, updates, and commands, and overall control of the malware is
carried out from these computers. Command and control computers include the servers at various
IP addresses and domains listed in Appendix A.
42.

Each instance of cracked versions of Cobalt Strike infecting a user’s computing

device is pre-programmed to connect and communicate with command and control servers. When
16

such a connection is made, the servers can download instructions or additional malware to the
infected computing device and upload stolen information from it.
43.

To create the command and control computers, Defendants set up accounts with

web-hosting providers - i.e., companies, usually legitimate, that provide facilities where computers
can be connected through high-capacity connections to the Internet and locate their servers in those
facilities. By contacting a command and control server, the cracked versions of Cobalt Strike can
receive updated commands and modules from and communicate with the Defendants.
44.

Figure 2 illustrates the communication channels of the cracked versions of Cobalt

Strike, between the command and control servers and infected victim computers.

Figure 2
INFECTION OF VICTIM COMPUTERS
45.

The cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are used by Defendants to compromise

countless end user computers, of the type commonly found in businesses, living rooms, schools,
libraries, and Internet cafes around the world. The Defendants are suspected of using various
means of infecting end-user computers. Cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are disseminated via
17

technical exploits of victim computers, malicious spam email, or spearphishing campaigns. These
campaigns send unsolicited emails that direct users to download the cracked versions, constituting
malware, from malicious websites, or trick the user into opening malware through an attachment,
such as a Microsoft Word document.
46.

Post-exploitation features of cracked, cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are

implemented as Windows DLLs (modules). To execute these features, Cobalt Strike “spawns” a
temporary process, and injects the module into it. Process injection is highly customizable to fit
the individual operator’s preferences including but not limited to memory allocation, protections,
obfuscation, and how to execute codes.
47.

Figure 3 outlines the popular legitimate Windows processes utilized by Cobalt

Strike for injecting the malicious modules.

Figure 3
48.

Although Cobalt Strike has the capability to upload and execute any tools based on

malware operator’s choice, the cracked, cracked Cobalt Strike framework contains built-in
commands that are implemented via modules (DLL). These tools are sent to the beacon DLL
18

running on the victim machines and injected to the Windows processes (for example, the process
svchost.exe), execute the module, and then report the result back to the operators via command
and control server via HTTP post request. Chart 1 provides a breakdown of the modules and their
purposes.

have the option to take continuous screenshots or use different method
to take screenshots. In connection with deploying cracked Cobalt Strike,
modules such as Keyloggers are used to intercept and gain access to the
contents of such wire and electronic communications, including access
to the passwords, personal identifying information, sensitive financial
information, or personal health information contained in such
communications.

Figure 4
USE OF RANSOMWARE
50.

Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) is a business model between ransomware

operators and affiliates in which affiliates pay to launch ransomware attacks developed by
operators. Due to the evolution to RaaS, cracked, versions of Cobalt Strike have become one of
the go-to tools for the malware operators to persist in the victim machines and to monitor and carry
on the intended attacks including installing ransomware, once suitable targets are identified. Each
attacker group utilizes its own versions of cracked versions of Cobalt Strike and in most cases
modifies/replaces the existing watermark with its own preferred value. Conti and LockBit are two
such ransomware families leveraging cracked versions of Cobalt Strike.
51.

Conti is an incredibly dangerous and damaging ransomware. Once the Conti

ransomware is deployed and executed on a victim’s device, a variety of actions involving DLLs
and Microsoft copyrighted APIs take place. Once deployed on a victim’s system, Conti will try to
terminate a number of services to ensure that it can encrypt files, disable real time monitoring, and
uninstalls the Windows Defender application, and subsequently demand a ransom or to engage in
20

other malicious activity directed at the victims.
52.

LockBit ransomware is malicious software designed to block user access to

computer systems in exchange for a ransom payment. Later iterations of LockBit (LockBit 2.0 and
3.0) have increased sophistication: the “fastest encryption software” in the world, the ability to
perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on the victims’ infrastructure, the ability to
steal sensitive data, and the ability to use leak sites to expose companies’ proprietary data.
DEFENDANTS JOINTLY LEVERAGE THE ENTERPRISE AND EACH OTHER’S WORKS
53.

John Does 1-16 constitute a group of criminal persons associated together for a

common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct, as part of an ongoing organization, with the
various associates functioning as a continuing unit (hereinafter the “Racketeering Enterprise”).
54.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereupon allege that the Defendants’

cooperative involvement in the development of cracked Cobalt Strike, the leverage of its
capabilities to infiltrate victim computers, the development of malicious loaders to proliferate
malware for the purpose of infecting victim computers, and the use of the cracked Cobalt Strike
infrastructure to establish an attack framework (such as ransomware as a service), demonstrates
that Defendants are acting in concert to cause significant harm to Plaintiffs, its customers, and
member organizations, in order to achieve great monetary gain.
55.

The Racketeering Enterprise has a purpose, with relationships among those

associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit those associates to pursue the
enterprise’s purpose. As Chart 2 below demonstrates, John Does 1-16 each have specialized roles
in the Racketeering Enterprise, on which the success and furtherance of the Enterprise is entirely
dependent. Namely, the Defendants leverage each other’s work to create, distribute and operate
cracked Cobalt Strike infrastructure, distribute, and use customized Cobalt Strike loaders, gain
21

access to victim computers using such infrastructure, and to install ransomware on victim
computers and steal money from victims. The Defendants’ ongoing association with one another
and reliance on each other’s contributions, allows the Enterprise to function as a continuing unit
and within a lucrative operational structure.

Chart 2 – Threat Group Function Summary.

Upon information and belief, John Does 1-2, the creators and proliferators of

cracked Cobalt Strike, work together with the purchasers, developers, and other sellers of the
payloads, ransomware as a service options, cracked Cobalt Strike loaders in a continuous and
coordinated manner to control, operate, and maintain the cracked Cobalt Strike infrastructure to
distribute malicious code.
57.

John Does 7-12 behave much like service providers and offer other groups the

ability to leverage cracked Cobalt Strike to develop, distribute, and manage payloads, access
networks, conduct reconnaissance into victim computers, and offer ransomware as a service. This
allows purchasers like John Does 15-16 to leverage access obtained through John Does 7-12 to
move laterally and stage Cobalt Strike payloads developed by John Does 13-14 to facilitate
malware campaigns.
58.

Plaintiffs’ investigation reveals that the Defendants work together in a continuous

and coordinated manner to control, operate, distribute and maintain cracked Cobalt Strike, its
infrastructure, and malicious payloads.
THE CRACKED COBALT STRIKE RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE
59.

The Racketeering Enterprise emerged in the past twenty-four months after certain

JAR files of Cobalt Strike was reverse engineered and disseminated, and when subsequently John
Doe 1 and John Doe 2 developed and established a command and control infrastructure to
23

proliferate its use. John Does 3-16 joined the enterprise when they leveraged the command and
control infrastructure to proliferate the ransomware, malicious payloads, and unauthorized
network access.
60.

The Racketeering Enterprise has continuously and effectively carried out its

purpose of developing and operating a global command and control infrastructure that gains
control of their victim’s machine, moves laterally through the connected network to find other
victims, installs malware, and continues to do so absent the judicial relief that Plaintiffs request.
61.

Both the purpose of the Racketeering Enterprise and the relationship between the

Defendants is proven by: (1) the repeated development and dissemination of cracked versions of
Cobalt Strike, (2) the subsequent development and operation of the command and control
infrastructure to proliferate malware and leveraging of the infrastructure for Ransomware as a
Service; and (3) Defendants’ respective and interrelated roles in the sale, operation of, and profiting
from the cracked Cobalt Strike in furtherance of Defendants’ common financial interests.
62.

Upon information and belief, Defendants have conspired to, and have, conducted

and participated in the operations of the Racketeering Enterprise through a continuous pattern of
racketeering activity as set forth herein. Each predicate act is related to and in furtherance of the
common unlawful purpose shared by the members of the Racketeering Enterprise. These acts are
continuing and will continue unless and until this Court grants Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary
restraining order.
63.

Upon information and belief, Defendants have conspired to, and have, knowingly

and with intent to defraud trafficked in thousands of unauthorized access devices in the form of
malware or ransomware infected end user terminals and network systems.
64.

As set forth in detail herein, Defendants have used the command and control
24

infrastructure to steal, intercept and obtain this access device information from countless
individuals.
65.

Upon information and belief, Defendants have also conspired to, and have,

knowingly and with intent to defraud, possessed, and do possess, thousands of such unauthorized
access devices fraudulently obtained as described herein.
66.

Upon information and belief, Defendants have conspired to, and have, knowingly

and with intent to defraud, extorted victims to receive millions of dollars in payment.
67.

Upon information and belief, Defendants have conspired to, and have, executed a

scheme to extort scores of healthcare institutions by enabling members of the Racketeering
Enterprise to infect their healthcare network systems, encrypt data, and only release control of its
systems and data through payment of ransom.
68.

Each of the foregoing illegal acts were conducted using interstate ACH and/or

interstate and/or foreign wires as described herein, and therefore affected interstate and/or foreign
commerce.
DEFENDANT’S UNAUTHORIZED USE OF MICROSOFT’S AND FORTRA’S
COPYRIGHTED SOFTWARE
69.

When Defendants developed cracked versions of Cobalt Strike, and when they

create the Conti and LockBit ransomware, they reproduce hundreds of lines of Microsoft’s
copyrighted Declaring Code in connection with their use of cracked Cobalt Strike to deploy
malware and their creation of the Conti and LockBit ransomware. Defendants’ conduct was
without authorization because the SDK License explicitly prohibits the use of Declaring Code in
any malicious software. Defendants then transmit this malicious code through the Internet to the
millions of infected computers, and reproduce the Declaring Code on command and control servers
25

and infected device.
70.

Hundreds of lines of Microsoft’s declaring code and the structure, sequence, and

organization of that code are copied with and across cracked Cobalt Strike modules and
ransomware like LockBit. An exemplary set of Declaring Code copied by Defendants in the
LockBit ransomware, is reflected Figure 5 below.

26

Figure 5
71.

When Defendants reproduced and distributed cracked versions of Cobalt Strike,

Defendants copied the entirety of Fortra’s copyrighted Cobalt Strike team server code in cracked
versions used for malicious purposes. The infringement involves unauthorized copying of
executable code for all of the Cobalt Strike team server’s web server, beacon and configuration
features and functionality, including all of Fortra’s creative and original method implementations,
interfaces, parameters, variables, arrays, data types, operators, and objects.
HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, THEIR CUSTOMERS AND MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS,
AND THE PUBLIC
Defendants Cause Severe Harm by Engaging in Malicious Activities Against Victims Such
as Deploying Ransomware
72.

Defendants inflict severe harm on individuals whose computing devices are

infected by their use of cracked versions of Cobalt Strike. Once a computing device is
compromised by cracked versions of Cobalt Strike, Defendants can use the victim’s computer to
send commands and instructions to the infected computing device to control it surreptitiously and
27

deliver malware that, among other things, enables Defendants to take control of the victim’s
computer and extort money from them. Defendants’ primary goal is to deliver ransomware and
enable attacks against other computers.
73.

The scope and scale of Defendants’ targeting of healthcare institutions is broad and

global in nature. Healthcare organizations such as hospitals in the United States and the European
Union have also been targeted by the Defendants. Thus, the threat posed by cracked versions of
Cobalt Strike is shared by the entire healthcare industry, many other industries, and Microsoft as
all must take substantial steps and make significant investments in defending against these types
of activities.
Defendants Cause Severe Harm by Distributing and Installing Other Types of Dangerous
Malware
74.

Defendants use cracked versions of Cobalt Strike to carry out a variety of illegal

activities, but such cracked versions are well-known known as downloaders/droppers for
delivering major malware families in what is known as a “malware-as-a-service” criminal
business model that delivers ransomware that locks a victim’s computer and demands payment
to unlock it, banking Trojans that steal funds from victim accounts, and a wide range of other
types of malware.
75.

In other words, one of the major activities associated with Defendants’ use of

cracked versions of Cobalt Strike is downloading and spreading secondary malware and other
malicious code onto infected computers, including the ransomware discussed in this declaration.
Each of these secondary malware infections makes further changes to the user’s computing device,
including by adding files, changing registry settings, opening additional backdoors that allow
control by other cybercriminals, and allowing yet further sets of malware to be downloaded onto
28

the computing device.
Defendants Cause Severe Harm to Plaintiffs’ Reputation, Brands and Goodwill with Its
Customers and Member Organizations
76.

Defendants’ activities using the cracked versions of Cobalt Strike harm Microsoft

and Microsoft’s customers by damaging the customers’ computing devices and the software
installed on their computing devices, including Microsoft’s proprietary Windows operating
systems. The cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are used by Defendants to infect and run on
computer devices equipped with the Windows operating system. The Windows operating system
is licensed by Microsoft to its users.
77.

Microsoft’s customers whose computing devices are infected with cracked versions

of Cobalt Strike used by Defendants are damaged by these changes to Windows, which alter the
normal and approved settings and functions of the user’s operating system, place hooks into the
operating system, destabilize it, and forcibly conscript the computing device into the Defendants’
malicious activities. Customers are usually unaware of the fact that their computing devices are
infected and have become part of the Defendants’ malicious Cobalt Strike infrastructure.
78.

Defendants’ activities using the cracked versions of Cobalt Strike harm Fortra, by

creating malicious instruments that are branded with Fortra’s trademark, to carry out cybercrime
activities. Defendants’ activities risk substantial confusion among Fortra’s security community
customers and consumers in general, and risk injuring Fortra’s commercial reputation.
79.

Defendants’ activities using cracked versions of Cobalt Strike harm H-ISAC’s

member healthcare organizations, not only through the infiltration of their healthcare network by
ransomware, but also because of the injury to their brand and reputation of the member healthcare
institutions. Defendants’ activities prompted H-ISAC’s pursuit of the interests of its member
29

organizations, given the repeated attacks to its member organizations’ network systems. Further,
with H-ISAC member organizations’ inability to provide consistent and reliable healthcare as a
result of the impact on its network systems, the member organizations’ reputation is weakened
given Defendants’ malicious activities.
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1201
(Microsoft, Fortra)
80.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs

1 through 79 above.
81.

Microsoft owns copyrights in the code, documentation, specifications, libraries,

and other materials that comprise the Windows system and the associated SDK.
82.

Fortra own copyrights in the code, documentation, specifications, libraries, and

other materials that comprise Fortra’s Cobalt Strike software.
83.

Defendants circumvent technological measures in relation to cracked Cobalt Strike

software, which includes Fortra’s and Microsoft’s copyrighted code, in order to access and
reproduce that code for the purpose of proliferating malware, including ransomware. By creating
cracked versions of Cobalt Strike in this way, Defendants thereby manufacture, distribute, and use
software that is primarily designed, produced, or marketed for the purpose of circumventing
technological measures that control access to and copying of copyrighted works.
84.

As a result of the Defendants’ actions, Microsoft’s and Fortra’s copyrighted code

has been accessed, copied, distributed, or otherwise used without authorization or compensation,
causing Microsoft to suffer irreparable harm and damages.
30

85.

Microsoft and Fortra therefore seeks injunctive relief, damages, and any other

remedies available under the DMCA and other applicable laws, as well as attorney’s fees and costs.
86.

As a direct result of Defendant’s actions, Microsoft and Fortra suffered and

continue to suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and which will
continue unless Defendants’ actions are enjoined.
SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Copyright Infringement, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.
(Microsoft, Fortra)
87.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs

1 through 86 above.
88.

Microsoft owns copyrights in the code, documentation, specifications, libraries,

and other materials that comprise the Windows system and the associated SDK.
89.

By Defendants’ actions alleged above, Defendants have infringed and will continue

to infringe, the Declaring Code by, inter alia, distributing, and creating derivative works in their
cracked version of Cobalt Strike, which reproduce Microsoft’s copyrighted declaring code for
Windows 8 Software Development Kit, which is required for the functionality of the cracked
versions of Cobalt Strike, in violation of Microsoft’s exclusive rights at least under 17 U.S.C. §
101 et seq. without any authorization or other permission from Microsoft.
90.

Defendants have reproduced and distributed cracked versions of Cobalt Strike

containing Microsoft’s Declaring Code on devices worldwide. Defendants proliferate them from
hosting companies that provide “hosting services,” which assign to those devices particular IP
addresses to have a presence on the Internet. Defendants use the hosting services to transmit the
malicious software through the Internet to the victims. Such use is not authorized. Defendants have
31

thus induced, caused, and materially contributed to the infringing acts of others by inducing,
allowing, and assisting others to copy and distribute the infringing code.
91.

Defendants’ infringement of Microsoft’s copyrights has been deliberate, willful,

and in utter disregard of Microsoft’s rights.
92.

Defendants’ malicious software also infringes Fortra’s copyright by literally

copying the entirety of its copyrighted Cobalt Strike “team server” code in a cracked version used
for malicious purposes. The infringement involves cracked copying of executable code for all of
the Cobalt Strike team server’s web server, beacon and configuration features and functionality,
including all of Fortra’s creative and original method implementations, interfaces, parameters,
variables, arrays, data types, operators, and objects.
93.

Defendants have realized unjust profits, gain, and advantages as a proximate result

of their infringement.
94.

Defendants will continue to realize unjust profits, gain, and advantages as a

proximate result of their infringement as long as such infringement is permitted to continue.
95.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ willful copyright infringement,

Microsoft has suffered, and will continue to suffer, monetary loss to its business, reputation, and
goodwill. Microsoft is entitled to recover from Defendants, in amounts to be determined at trial,
the damages it has sustained and will sustain, and any gains, profits, and advantages obtained by
Defendants as a result of Defendants’ acts of infringement and use and publication of copied
materials.
96.

Plaintiffs Microsoft and Fortra are entitled to an injunction restraining Defendants

from engaging in any further such acts in violation of the United States copyright laws. Unless
Defendants are enjoined and prohibited from infringing Microsoft’s and Fortra’s copyrights,
32

inducing others to infringe Microsoft’s and Fortra’s copyrights, and unless all infringing products
and advertising materials are seized, Defendants will continue to intentionally infringe and induce
infringement of Microsoft’s and Fortra’s registered copyrights.
THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF

105.

Microsoft’s Windows operating system software, and Microsoft’s customers’

computers running such software, and the network infrastructure of H-ISAC’s member healthcare
institutions are facilities through which electronic communication service is provided to users,
customers, and patients.
106.

Defendants knowingly and intentionally accessed the Windows operating system

and H-ISAC’s members’ healthcare network infrastructure, and associated software, services and
computers upon which this software and services run without authorization or in excess of any
authorization granted by Microsoft or H-ISAC’s members.
107.

Through this unauthorized access, Defendants intercepted, had access to, obtained

and altered, and/or prevented legitimate, authorized access to, wire and electronic communications
transmitted through the computers and infrastructure of Microsoft and its users and H-ISAC’s
members and their users.
108.

Unjust Enrichment
43

(Microsoft, Fortra, H-ISAC)
165.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs

1 through 164 above.
166.

The acts of Defendants complained of herein constitute unjust enrichment of the

Defendants at the expense of Microsoft, Fortra, and H-ISAC’s member institutions in violation of
the common law. Defendants used, without authorization or license, software belonging to
Microsoft, Fortra’s product Cobalt Strike, and healthcare network infrastructure belonging to HISAC’s member institutions to facilitate unlawful conduct inuring to the benefit of Defendants.
167.

Defendants profited unjustly from their unauthorized and unlicensed use of

Upon information and belief, Defendants had an appreciation and knowledge of the

benefit they derived from their unauthorized and unlicensed use of that property.
44

172.

Retention by the Defendants of the profits they derived from their malfeasance

would be inequitable.
173.

amount to be proven at trial, including without limitation disgorgement of Defendants’ ill-gotten
profits.

174.

As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs and H-ISAC’s member

institutions suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy at law

REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN YOUR FEDERAL TRADEMARK REGISTRATION
WARNING: YOUR REGISTRATION WILL BE CANCELLED IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE
DOCUMENTS BELOW DURING THE SPECIFIED TIME PERIODS.
Requirements in the First Ten Years*
What and When to File:
First Filing Deadline: You must file a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) between the 5th and 6th
years after the registration date. See 15 U.S.C. §§1058, 1141k. If the declaration is accepted, the
registration will continue in force for the remainder of the ten-year period, calculated from the registration
date, unless cancelled by an order of the Commissioner for Trademarks or a federal court.
Second Filing Deadline: You must file a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) and an Application
for Renewal between the 9th and 10th years after the registration date.* See 15 U.S.C. §1059.

Requirements in Successive Ten-Year Periods*
What and When to File:
You must file a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) and an Application for Renewal
between every 9th and 10th-year period, calculated from the registration date.*

Grace Period Filings*
The above documents will be accepted as timely if filed within six months after the deadlines listed above with
the payment of an additional fee.
*ATTENTION MADRID PROTOCOL REGISTRANTS: The holder of an international registration with an
extension of protection to the United States under the Madrid Protocol must timely file the Declarations of Use
(or Excusable Nonuse) referenced above directly with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
The time periods for filing are based on the U.S. registration date (not the international registration date). The
deadlines and grace periods for the Declarations of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) are identical to those for
nationally issued registrations. See 15 U.S.C. §§1058, 1141k. However, owners of international registrations
do not file renewal applications at the USPTO. Instead, the holder must file a renewal of the underlying
international registration at the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization, under
Article 7 of the Madrid Protocol, before the expiration of each ten-year term of protection, calculated from the
date of the international registration. See 15 U.S.C. §1141j. For more information and renewal forms for the
international registration, see http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/.
NOTE: Fees and requirements for maintaining registrations are subject to change. Please check the
USPTO website for further information. With the exception of renewal applications for registered
extensions of protection, you can file the registration maintenance documents referenced above online at h
ttp://www.uspto.gov.
NOTE: A courtesy e-mail reminder of USPTO maintenance filing deadlines will be sent to trademark
owners/holders who authorize e-mail communication and maintain a current e-mail address with the
USPTO. To ensure that e-mail is authorized and your address is current, please use the Trademark
Electronic Application System (TEAS) Correspondence Address and Change of Owner Address Forms
available at http://www.uspto.gov.
