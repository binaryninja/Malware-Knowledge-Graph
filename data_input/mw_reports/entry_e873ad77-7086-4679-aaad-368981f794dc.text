Multiple investigations and testing by the CrowdStrike Services team identified
inconsistencies in Azure AD sign-in logs that incorrectly showed successful logins via
Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) despite it being blocked.
Investigators rely on these logs to determine threat actor activity in investigations that
often involve legal and regulatory consequences for organizations.
This blog includes recommendations that should be implemented to block legacy
authentication in Microsoft 365 tenants to avoid a threat actor circumventing stronger
controls such as multifactor authentication (MFA).

Background
As many organizations move to the cloud, CrowdStrike has noticed a significant increase in
both opportunistic and targeted attacks against cloud resources, with a large number of
these attacks targeting organizations’ Microsoft 365 (M365) infrastructure, often specifically
around their business email service, or Exchange Online. In multiple investigations,
CrowdStrike has observed a logging inconsistency within the Azure AD sign-in events

related to mailbox access using legacy authentication protocols within M365. This article
highlights the inconsistency, shows how CrowdStrike was able to replicate it in a lab
environment and provides recommendations on configuration settings to help organizations
secure their M365 environment.
When investigating anomalous activity involving mailboxes in Exchange Online, CrowdStrike
investigators look at a number of log sources, including the Unified Audit Log and Azure AD
sign-in logs, to establish the scope of the activity. It is imperative for these log sources to
accurately capture information, as they are relied on by investigators to determine threat
actor activity in investigations that often involve legal and regulatory consequences for
organizations.

Legacy Authentication Protocols
Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol (POP) are authentication
protocols most widely used as part of legacy authentication to receive mail to mailboxes.
These protocols result in downloading a mailbox’s contents locally to the client from where
the authentication request was initiated. Hence, whenever these protocols are seen to be
used in an investigation involving email compromise, an assumption is made that the entirety
of the mailbox contents, which often include sensitive information, has been exfiltrated by the
threat actor. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an authentication protocol used as part
of legacy authentication to send mail from mailboxes. A threat actor will leverage a
compromised account, permitting the SMTP legacy protocol to send massive amounts of
spam or phishing emails to both internal and external users.

Tenant Configuration
In recent investigations, CrowdStrike has found a pattern of inaccurate logging in the Azure
AD sign-in logs that seems to falsely indicate a mailbox sync via legacy authentication
protocols (IMAP or POP). This pattern appears to manifest in M365 tenants that: do not have
legacy authentication configured to be blocked via a conditional access policy (CAP); have
POP and IMAP blocked at an individual mailbox level; and have the SMTP authentication
protocol allowed at the mailbox level.

Inaccurate Azure AD Sign-in Logs
In Azure tenants with no CAP in place blocking legacy authentication, but with IMAP blocked
at the Exchange Online mailbox level, CrowdStrike found that Azure AD sign-in logs showed
successful logins via an IMAP client application despite it being blocked at the mailbox level.
This logging pattern occurred when a third-party mail client, configured to use IMAP and
SMTP, was used to authenticate into a mailbox. While the client was able to successfully
send an email via SMTP, it was not able to download mail to the local system via IMAP due

to the mailbox-level block in place. In other words, the Azure AD log entry showing a
successful login via the IMAP protocol was inaccurate, as mail synchronization did not take
place.

Incorrect Authentication Flow Documentation
If the documented flow was followed, the authentication attempt should have been blocked
prior to reaching Azure AD, and thus should not have been picked up by the Azure AD signin logs. However, as we show in the proof of concept (POC) section below, the authentication
attempt is still logged in Azure AD sign-in logs, despite supposedly being blocked before
reaching Azure AD.
This pattern of logging is inconsistent with the documented authentication flow from
Microsoft:
When it’s blocked, Basic authentication in Exchange Online is blocked at the first preauthentication step (Step 1 in the previous diagrams) before the request reaches Azure
Active Directory or the on-premises IdP. The benefit of this approach is brute force or
password spray attacks won’t reach the IdP (which might trigger account lockouts due to
incorrect login attempts).

Recreating the Logging Inconsistency
CrowdStrike set up a POC environment to demonstrate this logging inconsistency with a
mailbox that had POP/IMAP disabled at the mailbox level, but SMTP authentication still
allowed (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 (Click to enlarge)

The POC environment did not have an Azure AD Conditional Access Policy that blocked
legacy authentication. CrowdStrike used Mozilla Thunderbird as a third-party mail client to
access the simulated victim’s mailbox with IMAP as the selected protocol, as shown in the
screenshot in Figure 3.

Figure 3

Authentication using the given credentials was successful, but mail was not allowed to be
synced to the local client device, as seen in Figure 4.

However, Azure AD sign-in logs showed successful authentication using IMAP, as shown in
the screenshot below.

Figure 5

The M365 Unified Audit Log also shows successful authentication via the BAV2ROPC user
agent, indicating basic authentication was used (see Figure 6).

6/8

Figure 6

As shown in CrowdStrike’s POC, the IMAP protocol authentication attempt was logged as
successful in the Azure AD sign-in log, but the victim’s mailbox was never successfully
synchronized or downloaded to the client machine. This inconsistency could lead a victim
organization to inaccurately conclude that the contents of the affected mailbox had been
exfiltrated by a threat actor, a scenario that often has regulatory and legal implications.
Also of note, Microsoft will be disabling POP and IMAP authentication to Exchange Online
beginning Oct. 1, 2022 per its announcement:
Effective October 1, 2022, we will begin to permanently disable Basic Authentication for
Exchange Online in all Microsoft 365 tenants regardless of usage, except for SMTP
Authentication.

Recommendations to Prevent Legacy Authentication
The following are recommendations to prevent the usage of legacy authentication protocols.
CrowdStrike recommends these actions to minimize the risk of a threat actor exploiting the
inherent weakness in legacy authentication that would allow them to gain access to a
mailbox.
Enable and enforce a conditional access policy blocking access that uses legacy
authentication to all client applications. This block will ensure that authentication
attempts to mailboxes using IMAP, POP or SMTP are blocked before reaching the
mailbox.

Ensure that basic authentication is disabled at the mailbox level, using the SetCASMailbox PowerShell cmdlet at individual mailboxes, and tenant-wide using the
Set-AuthenticationPolicy and Set-TransportConfig cmdlets.
(See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchangeonline/disable-basic-authentication-in-exchange-online)
Enable MailItemsAccessed on all mailboxes. The MailItemsAccessed operation as
part of Microsoft Advanced Auditing can assist investigators in validating whether a
certain mailbox has been downloaded offline to a threat actor-controlled system. This
operation covers authentication from both legacy and modern authentication protocols,
and records both sync (downloading actions) and bind (viewing actions). (See:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/mailitemsaccessedforensics-investigations?view=M365-worldwide)

Conclusion
CrowdStrike was able to demonstrate that in Azure tenants where IMAP/POP was blocked at
the Exchange Online mailbox level, but no CAPs were in place to block legacy
authentication, SMTP authentication attempts were incorrectly logged as logins via IMAP.
This logging pattern could lead to organizations erroneously concluding that the mailbox
contents had been downloaded to a client device controlled by a malicious third party, when
in fact the settings in place would have blocked any download attempt.
To ensure that threats arising from legacy authentication are mitigated, CrowdStrike
recommends that organizations enable and enforce a CAP that blocks legacy authentication
to all client applications; disable basic authentication at both the individual Exchange Online
mailbox level as well as tenant-wide; and for better monitoring capabilities, enable the
MailItemsAccessed operation on all Exchange Online mailboxes.
