Dark Tequila is a complex malicious campaign targeting Mexican users, with the primary
purpose of stealing financial information, as well as login credentials to popular websites that
range from code versioning repositories to public file storage accounts and domain
registrars.
A multi-stage payload is delivered to the victim only when certain conditions are met;
avoiding infection when security suites are installed or the sample is being run in an analysis
environment. From the target list retrieved from the final payload, this particular campaign
targets customers of several Mexican banking institutions and contains some comments
embedded in the code written in the Spanish language, using words only spoken in Latin
America.

Most of the victims are located in Mexico. The campaign has been active since at least 2013,
so it is a very ‘añejo’ (mature) product. There are two known infection vectors: spearphishing and infection by USB device.
The threat actor behind it strictly monitors and controls all operations. If there is a casual
infection, which is not in Mexico or is not of interest, the malware is uninstalled remotely from
the victim’s machine.

(Translation for “Abrir la carpeta para ver los archivos” – “Open folder to see files”. The word
“Archivos” is used by Spanish speakers from Latin America only)

The Dark Tequila malware and its supporting infrastructure are unusually sophisticated for a
financial fraud operation. The malicious implant contains all the modules required for the
operation and, when instructed to do so by net command server, different modules decrypt
and activate. All stolen data is uploaded to the server in encrypted form.
This campaign modules are as follows:

2/4

Module 1, which is responsible for communication with the command and control
server. It verifies if a man-in-the-middle network check is being performed, by validating
the certificates with a few very popular websites.
Module 2 – CleanUp. If the service detects any kind of ‘suspicious’ activity in the
environment, such as the fact that it is running on a virtual machine, or that debugging
tools are running in the background, it will execute this module to perform a full cleanup
of the system, removing the persistence service as well as any files created previously
on the system.
Module 3 – Keylogger and Windows Monitor. This is designed to steal credentials from
a long list of online banking sites, as well as generic Cpanels, Plesk, online flight
reservation systems, Microsoft Office365, IBM lotus notes clients, Zimbra email,
Bitbucket, Amazon, GoDaddy, Register, Namecheap, Dropbox, Softlayer, Rackspace,
and other services.
Module 4 – Information stealer, which is designed to steal saved passwords in email
and FTP clients, as well as from browsers.
Module 5 – The USB infector. This copies an executable file to a removable drive to run
automatically. This enables the malware to move offline through the victim’s network,
even when only one machine was initially compromised via spear-phishing. When
another USB is connected to the infected computer, it automatically becomes infected,
and ready to spread the malware to another target.
Module 6 – The service watchdog. This service is responsible for making sure that the
malware is running properly.
All the described modules are embedded inside the main sample and could be extracted
during the analysis process.
The campaign remains active. It is designed to be deployed in any part of the world, and
attack any targets according to the interests of the threat actor behind it. Kaspersky Lab
detects the campaign as Trojan.Win32.DarkTequila and Trojan.Win64.DarkTequila.
