SystemBC has historically been a proxy bot that has been around for sale since at least April
2019[1].

From:
SystemBC has also been leveraged by the TrickBot crew, specifically the high profile Ryuk
subgroup involved in extortion and ransomware activities[2,3].

The malware itself is pretty simplistic, although effective, but has mostly evolved into both a
backdoor and proxy bot since it was first released. Customers now access a payment
system over TOR(socks5v7v2snlwr7[.]onion) which presents a screen for building builds, the
amount of builds you can buy along with the price has changed over time with the current
option of buying involving 10 or 100 rebuilds.

After selecting which package you want you are given a screen with a timer and a wallet to
send the payment to.

After building you get a compressed archive containing your bot, server and PHP
component:
Name-----------------------install.txtdllwwwwww/systembcwww/systembc/geoipserver.exeserver.outsocks.exedll/socks3
City.mmdb------------------------

The server that actors buy the package from actually contains the builder and database
which is a collective of build IDs associated with each actors purchase and build. The stubs
needed for building are also present. This method of building is also commonly used for
crypters where you create a stub which is an already compiled executable file designed to
have certain pieces of it overwritten by using either tag based identifiers or offsets in the
binary. In this case it overwrites the needed configuration data in the stub files by finding the
‘BEGIN DATA’ marker and then packages them all up into a compressed archive for delivery
to the buyer.
BEGINDATAHOST1:192.168.1.149HOST2:192.168.1.149PORT1:4001TOR:

The server just needs which ports to listen on for communicating with the PHP panel as well
as with the incoming bots.
PORT0:4000PORT1:4001

Hiding behind TOR is becoming an increasingly common tactic for CyberCrime actors but it
does not make them invulnerable to being found, in this case the server after TOR is
107.175.150[.]179. From there we can recover most of the information needed for tracking
the actor selling the malware and their customers, including the stub files for building:
socks-null.exeserver-null.out

3/4

Along with the database of customers and their builds which makes finding the actors and
their panels relatively easy. Using the current pricing structure against the database we can
estimate that the actor has made over ~100k USD from just selling malware builds via this
server with just the current listing in the database. We also discovered that some of the
actors clients are high profile criminals in the CyberCrime domain.
Historically proxy bots such as SystemBC have not been tracked as closely, as it hasn’t
thought to be leveraged in large scale attacks, but we discovered some of the clients panels
contained a significant number of bots. Some of the groups this actor is selling to include
TrickBot, QBot and IcedID.

In conjunction with the discovery of the large panels we also discovered that some of the
panels the bots were being tasked with downloading CobaltStrike, for example one panel
was pushing the following tasks:
hxxp://172.104.63[.]157/crypt_beacon.exe hxxp://172.104.63[.]157/crypt_artifact.exe

Being leveraged by some large CyberCrime groups as more of a backdoor for delivering
CobaltStrike makes SystemBC one more thing to look out for being installed in your
environment and potentially left behind even after cleaning up the other related infections.
