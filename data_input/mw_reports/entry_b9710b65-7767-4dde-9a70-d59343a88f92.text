Norks trigger Uncle Sam's alarm with attack variant

The Lazarus Group hacking operation, thought to be controlled by the North Korean
government, has a new malware toy to pitch at potential targets and the US is getting
worried about it.
This according to a report from US-Cert, which say that the group (also known as "Hidden
Cobra") has a new piece of spyware capable of securely connecting to a control server and
uploading pilfered files from infected machine.
Known as "Hoplight," the malware is a collection of nine files, though most of those are
designed to work as obfuscation layers to keep admins and security software from spotting
the attack.
"Seven of these files are proxy applications that mask traffic between the malware and the
remote operators," US-Cert said in its write-up of the new Nork nasty.
"The proxies have the ability to generate fake TLS handshake sessions using valid public
SSL certificates, disguising network connections with remote malicious actors."
Below those seven proxy layers, Hoplight uses its valid SSL certificate to create the secure
connection, then a final, ninth file looks to create an outbound connection to the control
server in order to transmit pilfered information. The certificate looks to be a public SSL cert
from Naver, a Korean search engine and service provider.

McAfee: Oops, our bad. Sharpshooter malware was the Norks'
Lazarus Group the whole time
READ MORE
Within the bundle of files, US-Cert says, the malware package is able to perform a number of
remote control and spyware activities. This includes the ability to read and write local files,
create, terminate, or modify running processes and registry settings, and connect to a
remote host to upload and download files.
The Lazarus Group is something of an oddity in the world of government-backed hacking
groups. Unlike other state-sponsored operations, the primary focus of the group has not
been espionage or intellectual property theft, but rather financial crime aimed at helping the
isolated nation get cash into its coffers.
Lazarus/Hidden Cobra was also famously credited with pulling off the high-profile 2014
attack on Sony Pictures.
The group has typically used spear-phishing techniques to get its malware onto foreign
foreign targets, and US-Cert recommends admins and users take basic security measures
(such as patching systems regularly and maintaining up-to-date malware protections) in
order to safeguard from attacks. ®

In-brief Governments around the world should pass intellectual property laws that grant
rights to AI systems, two academics at the University of New South Wales in Australia
argued.
Alexandra George, and Toby Walsh, professors of law and AI, respectively, believe
failing to recognize machines as inventors could have long-lasting impacts on
economies and societies.
"If courts and governments decide that AI-made inventions cannot be patented, the
implications could be huge," they wrote in a comment article published in Nature.
"Funders and businesses would be less incentivized to pursue useful research using AI
inventors when a return on their investment could be limited. Society could miss out on
the development of worthwhile and life-saving inventions."

Declassified and released: More secret files on US govt's emergency doomsday
powers
Nuke incoming? Quick break out the plans for rationing, censorship, property seizures,
and more
Katyanna Quach Sat 28 May 2022 // 08:51 UTC 26
More papers describing the orders and messages the US President can issue in the
event of apocalyptic crises, such as a devastating nuclear attack, have been
declassified and released for all to see.
These government files are part of a larger collection of records that discuss the
nature, reach, and use of secret Presidential Emergency Action Documents: these are
executive orders, announcements, and statements to Congress that are all ready to
sign and send out as soon as a doomsday scenario occurs. PEADs are supposed to
give America's commander-in-chief immediate extraordinary powers to overcome
extraordinary events.
PEADs have never been declassified or revealed before. They remain hush-hush, and
their exact details are not publicly known.

Stolen university credentials up for sale by Russian crooks, FBI warns
Forget dark-web souks, thousands of these are already being traded on public bazaars
Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 22:34 UTC
Russian crooks are selling network credentials and virtual private network access for a
"multitude" of US universities and colleges on criminal marketplaces, according to the
FBI.
According to a warning issued on Thursday, these stolen credentials sell for thousands
of dollars on both dark web and public internet forums, and could lead to subsequent
cyberattacks against individual employees or the schools themselves.
"The exposure of usernames and passwords can lead to brute force credential stuffing
computer network attacks, whereby attackers attempt logins across various internet
sites or exploit them for subsequent cyber attacks as criminal actors take advantage of
users recycling the same credentials across multiple accounts, internet sites, and
services," the Feds' alert [PDF] said.

Big Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation
Study claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules
Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC 7
Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public
statements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common
organizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.
That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the
corporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown
state privacy bills.
The report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy
legislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,
Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the
State Privacy and Security Coalition.

SEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake
Meanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors
Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC 11
America's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed
his purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media
company hangs in the balance.
A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he "[did] not appear"
to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter "required 10 days
from the date of acquisition," and asked him to provide more information. Musk's
shares made him one of Twitter's largest shareholders. The letter is dated April 4, and
was shared this week by the regulator.
Musk quickly moved to try and buy the whole company outright in a deal initially worth
over $44 billion. Musk sold a chunk of his shares in Tesla worth $8.4 billion and bagged
another $7.14 billion from investors to help finance the $21 billion he promised to put
forward for the deal. The remaining $25.5 billion bill was secured via debt financing by
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, and others. But the takeover is not going
smoothly.

Cloud security unicorn cuts 20% of staff after raising $1.3b
Time to play blame bingo: Markets? Profits? Too much growth? Russia? Space aliens?
Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 19:19 UTC 14
Cloud security company Lacework has laid off 20 percent of its employees, just months
after two record-breaking funding rounds pushed its valuation to $8.3 billion.
A spokesperson wouldn't confirm the total number of employees affected, though told
The Register that the "widely speculated number on Twitter is a significant
overestimate."
The company, as of March, counted more than 1,000 employees, which would push
the jobs lost above 200. And the widely reported number on Twitter is about 300
employees. The biz, based in Silicon Valley, was founded in 2015.

Talos names eight deadly sins in widely used industrial software
Entire swaths of gear relies on vulnerability-laden Open Automation Software (OAS)
Jeff Burt Fri 27 May 2022 // 18:30 UTC 2
A researcher at Cisco's Talos threat intelligence team found eight vulnerabilities in the
Open Automation Software (OAS) platform that, if exploited, could enable a bad actor
to access a device and run code on a targeted system.
The OAS platform is widely used by a range of industrial enterprises, essentially
facilitating the transfer of data within an IT environment between hardware and
software and playing a central role in organizations' industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
efforts. It touches a range of devices, including PLCs and OPCs and IoT devices, as
well as custom applications and APIs, databases and edge systems.
Companies like Volvo, General Dynamics, JBT Aerotech and wind-turbine maker AES
are among the users of the OAS platform.

Despite global uncertainty, $500m hit doesn't rattle Nvidia execs
CEO acknowledges impact of war, pandemic but says fundamentals ‘are really good’
Dylan Martin Fri 27 May 2022 // 16:08 UTC 1
Nvidia is expecting a $500 million hit to its global datacenter and consumer business in
the second quarter due to COVID lockdowns in China and Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. Despite those and other macroeconomic concerns, executives are still
optimistic about future prospects.
"The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is
difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities
remain unchanged," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO and co-founder, during the
company's first-quarter earnings call.
Those two statements might sound a little contradictory, including to some investors,
particularly following the stock selloff yesterday after concerns over Russia and China
prompted Nvidia to issue lower-than-expected guidance for second-quarter revenue.

Another AI supercomputer from HPE: Champollion lands in France
That's the second in a week following similar system in Munich also aimed at
researchers
Dan Robinson Fri 27 May 2022 // 15:30 UTC 2
HPE is lifting the lid on a new AI supercomputer – the second this week – aimed at
building and training larger machine learning models to underpin research.
Based at HPE's Center of Excellence in Grenoble, France, the new supercomputer is
to be named Champollion after the French scholar who made advances in deciphering
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the 19th century. It was built in partnership with Nvidia using
AMD-based Apollo computer nodes fitted with Nvidia's A100 GPUs.
Champollion brings together HPC and purpose-built AI technologies to train machine
learning models at scale and unlock results faster, HPE said. HPE already provides
HPC and AI resources from its Grenoble facilities for customers, and the broader
research community to access, and said it plans to provide access to Champollion for
scientists and engineers globally to accelerate testing of their AI models and research.

UK monopoly watchdog investigates Google's online advertising business
Another probe? Mountain View is starting to look like a pincushion at this rate
Richard Currie Fri 27 May 2022 // 14:00 UTC 6
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority is lining up yet another investigation into
Google over its dominance of the digital advertising market.
This latest inquiry, announced Thursday, is the second major UK antitrust investigation
into Google this year alone. In March this year the UK, together with the European
Union, said it wished to examine Google's "Jedi Blue" agreement with Meta to allegedly
favor the former's Open Bidding ads platform.
The news also follows proposals last week by a bipartisan group of US lawmakers to
create legislation that could force Alphabet's Google, Meta's Facebook, and Amazon to
divest portions of their ad businesses.
