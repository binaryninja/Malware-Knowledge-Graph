Android Spyware Targeting Tanzania Premier League
zscaler.com/blogs/research/android-spyware-targeting-tanzania-premier-league

The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team is always hunting for malware out in the wild. Recently, there
have been endless cases where attackers were targeting mobile users with malware
leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amidst all the COVID-related malware activities, we actually came across some Android
malware samples that weren't COVID-19 related. Instead, they were targeting the ongoing
Tanzania Mainland Premier League football season. The Tanzania Mainland Premier
League is the top-level professional football (or soccer, as it is most commonly known here
in the United States) league in Tanzania, Africa.
We came across some of the Android Packages (APKs) that were targeting two of the most
famous football clubs in Africa, namely Simba SC and Yanga (Young Africans) SC.

We also found some legit apps on the Google Play store that are related to these clubs. As
seen in Figure 2, the spyware portrays itself as official apps of the above-mentioned teams.

These apps are basically spyware, which include the following capabilities:
Read SMS messages
Fetch contacts
Record audio
Calling functionality
Access real-time location
Read/write external storage
Steal photos

These capabilities basically sum up a perfectly developed spyware with full-fledged features
to spy on anyone.
Upon further analysis, these APKs turned out to be developed using a popular surveillance
tool named SpyMax. Its predecessor, SpyNote, was one of the most widely used spyware
frameworks. In the past, there were instances where SpyNote was notoriously used
to victimise Netflix users and a wide range of other Android users.
SpyMax seems to be new favorite among attackers in the underground forums. We found
some evidence where SpyMax has been developed in these underground forums with its
main focus on the latest Android compatibility and antivirus evasion.

Figure 3: Underground forum discussions about SpyMax.
As seen in Figure 3, many of the discussions are about trying to make SpyMax samples
fully undetectable (FUD) from antivirus scans.
Though SpyMax is free in itself, some developers claim to have developed their own
versions that are undetected by antivirus software and are selling the samples at rates
ranging from $45 to $350 per month. The same user in Figure 3 posted about his or her
costs as can be seen in Figure 4.

Getting back to the campaign, we unfortunately could not track back to the command and
control (C&C) server, as it was not active during our analysis. But we were able to get hold
of some more samples that were designed by the same attacker or group of attackers.
(Hashes can be found in IOC section at the end of this blog.)

One such sample developed by the attacker using SpyMax was a live streaming app
that claimed to stream live football matches from the Tanzania Premier League. The main
purpose behind this is likely to reach a wide range of football fans and attack their devices.
The icons of the app can be seen in Figure 5 (Live Stream is the first from the left).

All these apps behave in exact same way. As soon as the victim tries to open the app, it
crashes with message saying "App is not installed" before suddenly hiding the icon. This
activity makes victim believe that the app might be faulty and got removed implicitly
from mobile device. But in reality, the app hides itself from the victim and plays it's hideous
activities of spying on the user and sending all the stolen data back to the attacker.

Conclusion
Nowadays, developing high-end surveillance apps (also termed spyware or stalkerware) is
as easy as developing a basic Android app with the help of tools, such as SpyMax. Even a
novice can develop spyware and attack large number of public. As seen in this case, the
attacker used SpyMax to target Android users interested in an ongoing football season.
From a user point of view, it's always advisable to take utmost care when online, especially
in times when work-from-home has become the norm.
The precautions you take online have been covered extensively; even so, we believe this
information bears repeating. Please follow these basic precautions during the current crisis
â€”and at all times:
5/6

Install apps only from official stores, such as Google Play.
Never click on unknown links received through ads, SMS messages, emails, or
the like.
Always keep the "Unknown Sources" option disabled in the Android device. This
disallows apps to be installed on your device from unknown sources.
We would also like to mention that if you come across the incident of app hiding it's icon as
seen in case above, always try to search for the app in your device settings. (Settings ->
Apps -> Search for icon that was hidden)
