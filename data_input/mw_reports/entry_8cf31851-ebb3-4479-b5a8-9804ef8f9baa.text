SUMMARY

Incidents involving Iran have been among the most sophisticated, costly, and consequential attacks in the history of the internet. The four-decade-long U.S.-Iran cold war has
increasingly moved into cyberspace, and Tehran has been among the leading targets of
uniquely invasive and destructive cyber operations by the United States and its allies. At
the same time, Tehran has become increasingly adept at conducting cyber espionage and
disruptive attacks against opponents at home and abroad, ranging from Iranian civil society organizations to governmental and commercial institutions in Israel, Saudi Arabia,
and the United States.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT ENVIRONMENT
•

Offensive cyber operations have become a core tool of Iranian statecraft, providing
Tehran less risky opportunities to gather information and retaliate against perceived
enemies at home and abroad.

•

Just as Iran uses proxies to project its regional power, Tehran often masks its cyber
operations using proxies to maintain plausible deniability. Yet there are clear indications that such operations are conducted by Iranians and frequently can be linked
to the country’s security apparatus, namely the Ministry of Intelligence and Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps.

1

•

Iran’s cyber capabilities appear to be indigenously developed, arising from local
universities and hacking communities. This ecosystem is unique, involving diverse
state-aligned operators with differing capabilities and affiliations. Over the decade
that Iranians have been engaged in cyber operations, threat actors seemingly arise
from nowhere and operate in a dedicated manner until their campaigns dissipate,
often due to their discovery by researchers.

•

Though Iran is generally perceived as a third-tier cyber power—lacking the capabilities of China, Russia, and the United States—it has effectively exploited the lack of
preparedness of targets inside and outside Iran. Just as Russia’s compromise of Democratic Party institutions during the 2016 U.S. presidential election demonstrated that
information warfare can be conducted through basic tactics, Iran’s simple means have
exacted sometimes enormous political and financial costs on unsuspecting adversaries.

•

The same Iranian actors responsible for espionage against the private sector also conduct surveillance of human rights defenders. These attacks on Iranian civil society often foreshadow the tactics and tools that will be employed against other targets and
better describe the risks posed by Iranian cyberwarfare.

•

Through technical forensics of cyber attacks, researchers documenting these campaigns can provide a unique window into the worldview and capabilities of Iran’s
security services and how it responds to a rapidly changing technological and geopolitical environment.

U.S. RESPONSES GOING FORWARD
•

While Iran does not have a public strategic policy with respect to cyberspace, its history demonstrates a rationale for when and why it will engage in attacks. Iran uses
its capabilities in response to domestic and international events. As conflict between
Tehran and Washington subsided after the 2015 nuclear deal, so too did the cycle of
disruptive attacks. However, Iran’s decisionmaking process is obscured and its cyber
capabilities are not controlled by the presidency, as evident in cases of intragovernmental hacking.

•

The United States is reliant on an inadequately guarded cyberspace and should
anticipate that future conflicts, online or offline, could trigger cyber attacks on U.S.
infrastructure. The first priority should be to extend efforts to protect infrastructure
and the public, including increased collaboration with regional partners and nongovernmental organizations targeted by Iran.

2

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

•

Narrowly targeted sanctions could be used to deter foreign countries or other actors
from providing assistance to Iranian offensive cyber operations. Such restrictions should
still prioritize allowing Iranian society wide access to the internet and information technologies, to mitigate the regime’s ability to control information and communications.

•

The United States has pursued a name and shame strategy against Iranian threat actors, and should continue to do so. The Justice Department has issued indictments
against Iranians implicated in disruptive campaigns and has successfully obtained the
extradition from a third country of a hacker involved in the theft of military secrets.
Because of the small operational footprint of the groups, targeted sanctions or legal
proceedings are more symbolic than disruptive. These indictments may at least chill
participation by talented individuals who wish to travel or emigrate.

•

Iran continues to pursue its interests through cyber operations, engaging in attacks
against its regional opponents and espionage against other foreign governments. A
better understanding of the history and strategic rationale of Iran’s cyber activities is
critical to assessing Washington’s broader cyberwarfare posture against adversaries,
and prudent U.S. responses to future cyber threats from Iran and elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION

Cyberspace has become the newest frontier in the four-decade-long U.S.-Iran cold war.
Perhaps more than any government in the world, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been
the target of uniquely destructive cyber attacks by the United States and its allies. At the
same time, groups associated with Iran’s security forces—namely the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Intelligence—have become increasingly
adept at conducting their own offensive cyber operations. The targets of such operations
include Iranian government critics at home and abroad, corporations, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as the economic, defense, and diplomatic institutions of
countries including Germany, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.
The Iranian government has provided conflicting public accounts of its offensive cyber
operations, touting its capabilities while denying responsibility for attacks attributed to
it. Consistent with its use of proxy groups to assert its regional power, Tehran frequently
masks its involvement in such operations using cutouts (intermediaries) to avoid attribution and provide it plausible deniability. Despite these denials, it is clear Iran has invested
in indigenous cyber capabilities for both defensive and offensive purposes, and is willing
to use them in the event of conflict.
Tehran’s offensive cyber capabilities are relatively unsophisticated compared to states like
China, Russia, and the United States. While the Iranian hacking scene emerged in the early
2000s, there is little evidence of state-aligned cyber activities before 2007. This comparatively late start and underinvestment in part accounts for its lower capacity. Yet Moscow’s
compromise of Democratic Party institutions and political operatives during the 2016 U.S.

election demonstrated that information warfare can be conducted through basic tactics.
Iran has similarly preyed upon the lack of sophistication or preparedness of vulnerable targets both inside and outside Iran, including Saudi oil companies, Middle Eastern governments, and U.S. banks. Though these operations have often caused great financial damage,
the methods used to destroy data or disrupt access were relatively simple.
Iran has demonstrated how militarily weaker countries can use offensive cyber operations
to contend with more advanced adversaries. Tehran’s operations against foreign interests
have been mostly espionage and sabotage campaigns against soft targets in rival countries, rather than economic theft. Disruptive and destructive attacks have repeatedly been
used by Tehran to signal its ability to impose
retaliatory costs on its adversaries. Overall,
these disruptive incidents appear to have been

That said, most victims of Iranian cyber
operations are in Iran or the large Iranian
diaspora—the so-called internal enemies that
Tehran’s leadership fears. The early and effective adoption of the internet and social media by regime opponents and critics has fed
the perception of Tehran’s hardliners that foreign powers are conspiring to subvert the
Islamic Republic through new technologies. But the targets of Tehran’s digital surveillance include not only human rights defenders and perceived enemies of the state but
also apolitical cultural institutions and even Iranian government agencies. Digital espionage and disruptive attacks against government critics have demonstrated to the Iranian
public that its online activities are not outside the reach of the state.
This report provides a historical analysis of the activities and observed capabilities of
Iranian threat actors who perform offensive cyber operations, most likely on behalf of
the Islamic Republic. For purposes of maintaining a consistent terminology, the cyber
activities covered in this report are framed in terms of “offensive cyber operations,” which
in the U.S. Department of Defense’s words are actions “intended to project power by
the application of force in or through cyberspace,”1 or through distinguishing the intended effects (such as disruption, exfiltration, or destruction). This narrows the scope of
research to intelligence and other offensive actions, rather than the full realm of Iranian
government attempts to build influence online or control information.
Hackers working in coordination on cyber operations are described as “threat actors,”

although groups can have a single member and their composition can change over time.
The terms “state-sponsored” or “state-aligned” are used throughout this report to reflect
the direct relationship between the attackers and the Iranian government that is accounted for throughout the operations.2
Forensic artifacts and other records collected from cybersecurity research provide unprecedented insight into the security and intelligence priorities of the Iranian regime.
The true intent of an attacker is not always evident in an intrusion. The compromise of a
system for espionage or reconnaissance can later provide an electronic foothold used for
sabotage. While Tehran has conducted highly visible attacks against rivals during times
of conflict, the decade-long history of Iranian cyber operations reveals that the primary
reason for such campaigns appears to be espionage.
Iran has been the target of espionage and destructive coercive measures launched by foreign states, including not only the United States and Israel but also Canada, France, Russia, and the UK. These attacks further motivated Tehran to develop indigenous defensive
and offensive cyber capabilities as well as a credible retaliatory threat. These exchanges are
directly correlated to Iran’s domestic and geopolitical climate, which has been reflected in
the reduction of disruptive attacks since the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

ties. For example, the “sinkholing” of malware—the
interception of communications through the redirection of domain names—provides insight into both the perpetrators and the victims of
such campaigns. In other cases, the lack of professionalism by Iranian groups has led to
the disclosure of names, aliases, and email addresses of their members in malware code
and domain registration records.
This first-hand research complements numerous reports—based also on primary source
material—published by cybersecurity companies on specific Iran-related incidents or
threat actors. These publications provide alternative insights into Iran’s targeting of other
sectors outside the authors’ immediate perspective, such as defense companies and gov-

ernments. An index of these reports will be made available online.3 Interviews with targets of Iranian campaigns—including activists and scholars based in Iran and abroad—
help elucidate Tehran’s motivations and place the attacks in a broader context. Interviews
with cybersecurity professionals similarly provide background on larger industry trends.
The intent of this report is to strengthen policy discussions of Iran’s cyber operations by
increasing public knowledge about the nature of such activities. Since cybersecurity research is typically limited to disclosures of specific threat actors or incidents, such publications do not provide insight into larger motivations and observable trends. This report
differs in that it considers the historical patterns and the broader context of Iranian cyber
operations, particularly their relationship to changing political conditions. It also emphasizes the overlap between Iranian campaigns conducted against foreign government
institutions and/or corporate entities and those directed against human rights and civil
society organizations, commonly neglected stakeholders in cybersecurity policy debates.
A better understanding of the history and strategic rationale of Iran’s offensive cyber
operations must inform U.S. strategy toward Iran and future U.S. responses to Iran’s actions. This is especially true given the United States is reliant on an inadequately guarded
cyberspace and should anticipate that future U.S. cyber attacks against Iranian targets
could trigger retaliatory attacks on U.S. infrastructure. Iran’s recent history suggests such
an outcome.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

CHAPTER ONE

IRAN: TARGET AND PERPETRATOR

Since the first publications on Iranian cyber activities in the summer of 2012—disclosing
a malware agent named Madi—cybersecurity companies and Western government agencies have routinely documented intrusions, disruptions, and other malicious activities
originating from Iran.4 Yet aside from attacks that sought to subvert foreign infrastructure, these reports have rarely provided context about Tehran’s offensive cyber operations
and the motivations for attacks.
Tehran’s perspective is shaped by the many attacks that have targeted its own infrastructure. Since Iran’s covert nuclear facilities were exposed by an opposition group in 2002,
numerous foreign actors have staged intrusion operations that sought to gain access to
Iran’s nuclear facilities, economic infrastructure, military apparatus, and governmental
institutions, for both espionage and sabotage.5
Indeed, the most prominent example of modern cyberwarfare was the sustained campaign of sabotage—unprecedented in its sophistication and preparation—carried out by
the United States and Israel against Iran’s nuclear facilities. In what was known as Operation Olympic Games, the malware agent Stuxnet was used to sabotage components of
the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, resulting in the destruction of over 1,000 centrifuges and setting back Iran’s nuclear progress by more than a year. This marked one of
the first known uses of offensive cyber operations as a coercive measure between states.6
While Stuxnet was solely intended to degrade Iran’s nuclear program, other campaigns
sought to sabotage the country’s financial and oil infrastructure. In May 2012, a consor-

9

tium of researchers disclosed another destructive operation against Iran.7 Malware agents
known as Wiper and Flame, successors to Stuxnet, had been discovered when Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum and the National Iranian Oil Company computers were disabled, their
hard drives overwritten in a unilateral operation reportedly conducted by Israel.8
Coercive cyber operations targeting Iran continued following Operation Olympic
Games. In June 2012, amid stalled nuclear negotiations between Iran and international
powers, Tehran’s minister of intelligence claimed the country’s nuclear facilities were
subject to another “massive cyber attack.”9 Later that year, Iran alleged additional disruptive operations targeting its Central Bank, Ministry of Culture, and drilling platforms
operated by the Iranian Offshore Oil Company.10
In addition to sabotage, foreign intelligence agencies have continually targeted Iranian
infrastructure for purposes of espionage, a fact made public to Iran through the intelligence disclosures of Edward Snowden. A former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)
worker, Snowden leaked a presentation on a tool known as Boundless Informant showing Iran to be one of the most highly surveilled countries in the world: billions of Iranian
internet and telephone records have been collected by the intelligence agencies of the
United States and its partners. In fact, Iran is so frequently surveilled that a Canadian
espionage operation targeting Iran once stumbled across a French-run intelligence operation that had compromised the very same network.11

HOW IRAN EMBRACED CYBER REPRESSION
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has long believed Washington aspires to
overthrow the Islamic Republic by instigating mass mobilization along the lines of the
1989 Velvet Revolution that toppled the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia.12 Following similar logic, Iran’s first cyber operations were motivated by fears that the internet
facilitated external threats to regime stability. Tehran often labels the online dissent of its
citizenry as cyberwarfare orchestrated by its enemies, namely the United States, to subvert
the Islamic Republic. Western government support for unrestricted internet access and
Persian-language satellite television stations—such as BBC Persian TV—are perceived as
key elements of this strategy. The advent of social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, and messaging apps, such as Telegram, are especially threatening given they challenge
the Iranian government’s long-standing monopoly over media and communications.
Khamenei’s greatest concerns were realized when the June 2009 contested reelection of
hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad—amid widespread allegations of fraud—provoked Iran’s largest popular uprisings since the country’s 1979 revolution. It was also a

10

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

pivotal moment in the Iranian government’s embrace of offensive cyber capabilities, as
this mass mobilization—known as the Green Movement—became one of the first known
targets of the regime’s operations. The online contest between the opposition, using the
internet to coordinate political resistance, and the government, attempting to repress mobilization, set the stage for future conflicts, including those with foreign powers.
Soon after an estimated 2 million Iranians protested in Tehran on June 15, 2009, supporters of the Green Movement began to battle the government over control of information.13 When the authorities expelled foreign media, interfered with mobile phone
networks, and arrested prominent critics, the internet became a primary channel for
coordination amid the chaos. In response, the

activists and opposition leaders called for street protests, critical websites were subject to
a deluge of malicious internet traffic to disrupt access, known as distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS) attacks.15 Government critics were spied on with malware posing as information on upcoming protest plans and public scandals.16 An Iranian hacker breached
the Dutch security company DigiNotar to fraudulently issue encryption certificates that
allowed Tehran to spy on all domestic Gmail users, one of the largest security breaches in
the history of the internet.17
Ultimately, the brutality, surveillance, and censorship exercised by the security forces
debilitated the Green Movement, and by 2011 public protests had subsided. Security
agencies had adapted to the modern digital environment, with interrogations by the
IRGC including an intimate review of an arrestee’s personal life based on printed copies of his or her online communications and social media. An IRGC chief later said that

Movement demonstrated to the Islamic Republic that the internet could be used as an
instrument of mass mobilization and posed an effective challenge to the regime’s longheld information monopoly.
The tactics, tools, and threat actors that arose during this domestic challenge to regime
stability would foreshadow the cyber posture of Iran toward a wider set of internal and
foreign threats. A recurrent theme since the outset of Iran’s cyber operations is that Iranian campaigns do not maintain clear boundaries between operations directed against its
internal opposition and those directed against foreign adversaries.19 The same infrastructure and tools used by Iranian threat actors for campaigns against the American defense
industry are also used to target Persian-language women’s development programs; the
same malware used in destructive attacks against Saudi government institutions had been
previously used for surveillance against members of the Green Movement opposition.

IRAN’S OFFENSIVE CYBER CAPABILITIES
Cyber operations have provided Tehran less risky opportunities to gather information
and retaliate against perceived enemies at home and abroad. Before information communication technologies were widely available, the Iranian government’s foreign intelligence operations centered chiefly on recruiting agents to spy on and assassinate political
dissidents or the diplomats of rivals. These operations usually resulted in international
embarrassment when the attackers were caught and condemnation when they succeeded.

Over the past decade, offensive cyber operations have become a core tool of Iranian statecraft, for the purposes of espionage, signaling,
and coercion. Accounts of Iran’s offensive cyber
operations follow a consistent pattern across
campaigns and among different threat actors. Operations focus on well-defined sets of
targets and are less sophisticated than the campaigns of state-sponsored threat actors
in other countries—to credibly signal threats and create deterrence requires assured
repeatability, a capability that Tehran generally still lacks.
Moreover, the level of professionalization, preparation, and investment necessary to
conduct an operation like Operation Olympic Games remains far outside the capacity of

12

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Iranian threat actors. Unlike the cyber operations of the United States and Israel, which
are conducted by professional intelligence services supported by billion dollar budgets,
Iran’s offensive and defensive capabilities are disorganized and modestly funded.20 Thus,
while Iran frequently turns to disruptive attacks to apply pressure, it faces a ceiling of
capability and opportunity in its ability to threaten opponents. Tehran’s clandestine human intelligence gathering in foreign countries, particularly outside the Middle East, is
of similarly low sophistication.
Tehran rarely claims responsibility for offensive cyber operations attributed to it, including those espousing support for the Islamic Republic, and has made contradictory
statements on its cyber posture. Iranian authorities have a history of embellishing the
country’s military capacity, including for cyber operations. In responding to a series
of disruptions of its own infrastructure in October 2012, then minister of intelligence
Heidar Moslehi asserted that “the Islamic Republic is so powerful in the cyber space that
[even] leaders of the arrogant powers admit and acknowledge our country’s successes.”21
However, IRGC commander Mohsen Kazemeini also claimed that the IRGC’s cyberwarfare division was not tasked with conducting offensive operations.22 Official rhetoric
also appears to conflate the state’s effort to push online propaganda with offensive cyber
capabilities, leading to claims of tens of thousands of cyber warriors.
Iran has used reports of destructive incidents to portray itself as a victim of foreign aggression, deflect attention away from its own actions, and boast of its ability to neutralize
potential attacks. When accused by the United States of having conducted a disruptive
attack against American banks, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Jaberi Ansar responded that “the U.S. government, which put millions of innocent people at the risk of
an environmental disaster through cyber attacks against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities,
is not in a position to level accusations against the citizens of other countries, including
those of Iran, without substantiated evidence.”23 Iranian officials appealed to international institutions for relief after the country had been affected by the malware agents Flame
and Wiper, a move that aligned with its calls for greater United Nations (UN) control
over the internet.24
In public statements, Iran has often emphasized its defensive capabilities, announcing in
2015 that its Cyber Attacks Emergency Center had successfully managed to thwart U.S.
cyber attacks against the country’s industrial infrastructure.25 Iranian military officials
regularly announce new defense products developed by domestic contractors, the most
prominent example being the antivirus software Padvish.26 Despite these claims, Iran has
shown little success in fostering a mature cybersecurity industry and lags behind both
developed economies and key regional rivals in terms of investing in defense or formulating national policies to secure critical infrastructure.

While the Iranian government has committed tens of millions of dollars to cybersecurity
in recent years, the scale of these investments pales in comparison to the billions spent
annually by the U.S. government or the hundreds of millions spent individually by American
banks.27 Were Iran to focus on improving its deIran is generally perceived

sive posture that is unlikely to change.
Despite its confident claims, Iran is generally
perceived as a third-tier cyber power, lacking an advanced indigenous cybersecurity
apparatus capable of carrying out sophisticated operations like China, Israel, Russia,
and the United States.28 While technical sophistication does not impede Iranians from
conducting successful cyber operations, those actions reflect a disorganization and lack of
professionalism that runs contrary to what would be expected of a state actor and limits
their capabilities. Tehran’s political and economic isolation has further constrained it
from acquiring technology and expertise from foreign governments or companies, and
little evidence exists that would indicate substantial cooperation with other nations in the
development of its offensive cyber capabilities.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ESPIONAGE AND SABOTAGE
Media accounts of cyber operations often paint incidents with a broad brush, labeling all
intrusions as attacks regardless of whether the outcome was destructive.29 Offensive cyber
operations, however, can be more accurately labeled according to their intent and impact,
distinguishing espionage and sabotage. Iranian actors have both engaged in intrusions
to extract information from foreign networks (espionage, information gathering) and
performed destructive actions to punish or coerce adversaries (sabotage), with a gray area
in the middle related to signaling and other motivations. Understanding this difference is
important in assessing Tehran’s strategy and the legality of its operations.
International law differentiates activities that are legal, though not desirable, from those
that are illegal and could prompt dangerous escalation.30 Just as international law differ-

14

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

entiates traditional espionage from coercion or violence, these same principles also apply
to cyber espionage. Legal scholars have asserted that “mere intrusion into another State’s
systems does not violate the non-intervention principle.”31
Indeed, given the growing number of nations with offensive cyber capabilities, espionage
and information gathering through cyber operations has increasingly become accepted
as an international norm.32 While the United States naturally denounces Tehran’s targeting of State Department employees, for example, such incidents mirror similar espionage
operations against Iranian diplomats by U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies.33
International law experts have provided frameworks for determining what constitutes an
“armed attack” in cyberspace, based on severity, invasiveness, directness, and other factors. Such frameworks also reinforce the importance of terminology, differentiating, for
example, espionage against the Navy Marine Corps Intranet from a destructive incident
such as Iran’s attack on Saudi Arabia’s and the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco.34 Relatedly, scholars have noted that Iran’s use of proxies in offensive cyber operations
does not absolve the government of legal obligations or repercussions for their outcome,
based in part on international case law from the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.35
Consistent evaluation of the legality of Iranian cyber operations provides clearer public
benchmarks for assessing when Iran violates internationally respected principles and engages in illegitimate behavior. As Tehran continues to conduct offensive cyber operations,
it is important for policymakers to assess the intent, scope, and legality of Iran’s actions
before considering counter responses.

CHAPTER TWO

IRAN’S CYBER ECOSYSTEM:
WHO ARE THE THREAT ACTORS?

The Islamic Republic of Iran is unique in that its most powerful officials—namely Supreme Leader Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—are inaccessible,
while its most accessible officials—including Foreign Minister Javad Zarif—are far less
powerful. Iran’s offensive cyber activities are almost exclusively overseen by the IRGC—
likely without the oversight of the country’s publicly “elected” officials—and composed
of a scattered set of independent contractors who mix security work, criminal fraud, and
more banal software development. While the relationships between proxies and governments can range from passive support to complete control, Iran’s indigenous threat actors
maintain an arm’s-length relationship to the state, with certain operations orchestrated to
meet the needs of the government.36
After successfully suppressing the 2009 Green Movement and first detecting the Stuxnet
attack in 2010, Iranian threat actors conducted sustained campaigns against domestic
and foreign adversaries. These indigenous operations appear to be performed by small
groups of individuals that have varying levels of technology experience with no more
than ten people per team. These campaigns and the resources produced by the groups
range from rudimentary to relatively professional, but most actors still face a low capacity ceiling.37
Though U.S. officials and some cybersecurity companies have speculated that Tehran has
received technical assistance from countries like Russia and North Korea, the level of sophistication is commensurate with the established practices of amateur hacking communities inside Iran.38 While Iranians have demonstrated talents in social engineering and

embedding themselves in compromised networks, this alone is not indicative of external
training or technological transfers.
On several occasions, Iranian threat actors have used off-the-shelf or pirated versions of
professional penetration testing tools to conduct campaigns, but there is little indication
of Tehran acquiring exploits or malware from foreign governments. Iran has acquired
hardware for internet surveillance from Chinese telecommunication firms and maintains
cooperative agreements with Russia on cybersecurity; however, these relationships differ
from providing Tehran with offensive cyber capabilities.39 No publicly documented or
privately observed attack has demonstrated the use of tools or resources that are beyond
the capacity of Iranian threat actors.
In principle, the tools and tactics used in cyber operations are subject to an exposure risk.
Unlike conventional weapons, malware attacks or other cyber activities lose their effectiveness when discovered and when their functionality and infrastructure is documented.
Describing a missile does not provide effective countermeasures, but describing malware
can provide antivirus companies and system administrators the ability to protect systems.
State-aligned threat actors will likely not employ the most sophisticated tools and strategies available to them unless the target is well protected and worth potentially exposing
tradecraft to compromise. However, unlike in other countries, there are not observed
examples from Iranian threat actors of escalation into more sophisticated attacks against
hardened targets.40
Iranian threat actors conduct campaigns with established toolkits that sometimes last for
years and ensnare hundreds of targets. However, the fluid nature and decentralization
of these groups make them relatively difficult to track. Malware that is publicly attributed to Tehran is often abandoned immediately on exposure, and identifiable members
appear to change groups over time. Some groups seem to split up, have members move
elsewhere, or even collaborate, further blurring lines.41 For example, while an IRGCaffiliated group labeled Rocket Kitten was the most active operator for a two-year period
(2014–2016), attracting press attention as Iran’s premiere threat, it has since faded into
quiescence, eclipsed by the actor Oilrig.42
Despite their substantial financial impact, Tehran’s disruptive operations against foreign
targets have been technically simple. The compromise of a small number of IT personnel
enabled the destruction of data on computers maintained by Saudi Aramco, eventually
resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.43 In only a few campaigns have
Iranian threat actors shown the professionalism and sophistication approaching that
expected of a nation-state actor; in one such case, the operation could be tied directly to
the Ministry of Intelligence (Magic Kitten, discussed later).44

18

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Success can often be attributed to security failures and to poor protection of infrastructure on the part of the victim, alongside opportunistic targeting and patience by the attacker. The defacement of Voice of America’s websites by the Iranian Cyber Army, one of
the first disruptive attacks by Iran against the United States, was accomplished through
social engineering the news agency’s domain name service provider.45 Other basic security
failures gave Iranians a toehold in the networks of Las Vegas Sands Corp. after its owner,
Sheldon Adelson, advocated military force against Iran.46 Symantec, an American cybersecurity company, noted that the perpetrators of a recent Saudi-focused campaign had
invested a “significant amount of preparatory work for the operation,” but the custom
malware was described by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky as “generally of low quality” partially derived from open-source toolkits.47
Similarly, a major attack on the American financial sector—known as Operation
Ababil—which caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, was described as one of
the largest DDoS attacks known at the time. Yet it took only a few young Iranian computer experts, breaching thousands of websites that were running vulnerable software, to
pool enough bandwidth to overwhelm the infrastructure of banks and cause unpredicted
software failures.48 Thus, while Iranian threat actors have limited capacity, through basic
tradecraft and persistence they can still be effective at espionage and sabotage.
The overall sophistication and dedication observed in such campaigns has not significantly changed in the decade that Iran has engaged in offensive cyber operations—the attacks
documented against Las Vegas Sands Corp. in 2014 are comparable to those used against
Saudi Arabia in renewed hostilities over the course of 2016-2017. Indeed, many research
disclosures cover groups that have been active for several years, using the same malware
with only incremental changes over the course of time.
While sophistication alone can be a superficial metric of posed threat, Iranian operations do not demonstrate the common technical precautions taken by other nation-state
actors (such as obfuscating malware), and, even with strong social engineering capabilities, attacks are often betrayed by a lack of investment in nontechnical resources (such
as fluency in English or personal tailoring of messages).49 These resource constraints also
account for why Iranians are more effective at compromising dissidents—Iranian threat
actors understand their target’s context and language, as opposed to when they are tasked
with European languages or other cultures. Iran shows little indication of becoming a
first-tier cyber power in the foreseeable future unless it begins to further organize its
operations and invest in professionalism.

MAGIC KITTEN
In January 2015, the German news outlet Der Spiegel released previously unpublished documents on cyber espionage conducted by American intelligence
agencies.50 One of them revealed an NSA tactic labeled “fourth party collection,”
which is the practice of breaking into the command and control infrastructure
of foreign-state-sponsored hackers to look over their shoulders. The presentation
describes a real-life example of acquiring intelligence and stealing victims from a
group code-named VOYEUR by the NSA, otherwise known as Magic Kitten.
Magic Kitten appears to be among the oldest and most elaborate threat actors
originating in Iran. It is also distinct from other groups because of its apparent
relationship with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence rather than the IRGC.
However, Magic Kitten’s activities mirror those of other groups, with the primary targets being Iranians inside Iran and Tehran’s regional rivals. The earliest
observed samples of Magic Kitten’s custom malware agent dates to 2007, well
before other known malware apparently originated, and the threat actor continues to be active.
Magic Kitten appears to exercise the most mature tradecraft of Iran-based threat
actors. It has opportunistically compromised dozens of websites at random
(including those of an Indian hospital, an Italian architect, and a well-known
Canadian comedian) to create a relay network to hide its operations. Such attention to tradecraft appears elsewhere in Magic Kitten’s operations, including in
the design of malware, which is modular in nature.
Magic Kitten has not been observed using sophisticated exploits and instead appears to rely on social engineering and other common tactics to deceive users. In
the case of the journalist Vahid Pour Ostad, the malware was sent by his former
Ministry of Intelligence interrogator with a threat attached and relied on private
records that would have been available only to government actors. This coordination represents both independent confirmation of the NSA’s attribution and
an extreme example of the strategies employed by Magic Kitten. Other samples
of the malware agent appear to have been delivered posing as Turkish asylum
forums for Syrian refugees.

20

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

The NSA presentation also provides a window on Magic Kitten’s targets up to
May 2011, portraying an operation focused on North America, Europe, and the
Middle East. These campaigns continued through the June 2013 presidential
election of Hassan Rouhani, provoking a blogpost from Google about related
attacks.51 As the election approached, exposed logs showed the daily capture
of dozens of accounts connected to Iranian cultural and media figures, graduate students, and social activists (including individuals that would later join the
Rouhani administration). Magic Kitten continued to target Iranians after the
election, attempting to unmask pseudonymous internet users by baiting them
with content on women’s rights and the security establishment.
Like other Iranian operations, Magic Kitten maintains a strong secondary interest in conducting espionage against regional targets and international foreign
policy institutions. CrowdStrike, another American cybersecurity company,
accounts for part of this focus on “international corporations, mainly in the
technology sector” and other political targets.52 An NSA slide with a victim map
portrays a broad-reaching operation targeting nearly every country in the Middle
East. Sinkhole data collected from expired domains previously used as relays and
other fallback infrastructure suggest that Magic Kitten, or the malware agent
used, continues to actively compromise individuals in Germany, Indonesia, Iraq,
Lebanon, the Netherlands, Palestine, Pakistan, Qatar, Sweden, Switzerland,
Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Notably, compromised individuals in
Iraq were also typically in Iraqi Kurdistan, mirroring a common pattern with
other threat actors.
A diagram within the NSA presentation suggests that the malware agent employed by Magic Kitten was also used at the time by Iran’s Shia Lebanese proxy
Hezbollah, under independent infrastructure. While Hezbollah has been known
to maintain its own offensive cyber operations and engage in intelligence sharing
with Iran, there has been little prior evidence of direct sharing of tools.53

UNDERSTANDING IRANIAN GOVERNMENT
INVOLVEMENT AND ATTRIBUTION
It is often difficult to determine the origins and perpetrators of Iranian offensive cyber
operations, as these campaigns may disappear as quickly as they appear. Public exposure often leads them to change tactics and abandon tools, making tracking even more
difficult. The history of cyber operations targeting Iranians and originating from Iran is
populated by groups that arise out of nowhere and conduct campaigns for ambiguous
reasons over a finite time span, then disappear. This unusually frenetic character conspicuously differentiates the Iranian hacking ecosystem from that found elsewhere, particularly those
tied to state actors in advanced countries.

The amateur hackers connected to the Iranian
defacement community have long been politically engaged and have often vandalized foreign
sites for ostensibly nationalistic reasons.54 In one
of the first international incidents attributed
to Iran, domestic hacking groups in mid-2008
exchanged tit-for-tat defacements with competitors in neighboring Arab countries after the official sites of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani were
vandalized with anti-Shia content by an Emirati
hacker. Such defacement activities can often evolve into state-affiliated activities: one of
the participants in the anti-Sunni website-defacement campaign in 2008 was later linked
to the Iranian Cyber Army. This transition from patriotic hackers to state-aligned threat
actors, and the ambiguity between civic nationalism and state involvement, mirrors the
apparent development of cyber communities in China and elsewhere.55
In only two incidents have Iranian government entities taken direct credit for the defacement of political opposition sites, both attributed to branches of the Revolutionary
Guard. The first case was the March 2010 takedown of sites connected to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran, which was alleged to be training cadres to mobilize
against the regime like the Velvet Revolution. The attack relied on the arrest of a website
administrator inside the country rather than on complicated tactics. The arrests and
destruction of data had a lasting impact on the organization by instilling fear in members
and giving rise to rumors about collaboration with the government.
The second government-initiated campaign, carried out during a Shia holiday in December 2013, led to the defacement of nine human rights and independent media websites

with a Quranic verse in Arabic and Persian. The IRGC’s Public Relations Department
announced that the operation had been conducted by the Revolutionary Guard’s Kerman Branch and claimed that the defaced websites had been established by the country’s
enemies and supported by internal seditionists.
In most cases, Iran uses cutout or proxy organizations, allowing it to keep some distance
from the disruptive incidents and propagandistic defacements. These cutouts represent
themselves as patriotic Iranians or pan-Islamic movements acting independently in
defense of the supreme leader, national sovereignty, and religious ideals. Conducting
offensive cyber operations through covert organizations provides Tehran plausible deniability for any attacks, thereby protecting its claim to victimhood while also allowing the

such proxies. When the U.S. Justice Department
unsealed its Operation Ababil indictment in March
2016, it named two Iranian corporate entities that employed at least seven individuals
who had been contracted by the Iranian government.57 The indictment implicated three
of the participants as being part of the Sun Army, an Iranian cutout defacement group.
The Sun Army followed the typical pattern found with the Iranian Cyber Army and
other state-aligned defacements, arising out of nowhere to perform targeted political acts
over a short life span. Its first documented defacements, in February 2010, were of sites
connected to now-detained opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi. The vandalism accused
him of being a traitor and was timed to blunt planned antigovernment street protests.58
As Iran’s cybersecurity landscape has professionalized, some defacement groups have
sought to convert their infamy into corporate success. Based on the disclosure of personal
information about threat actors, there are indications that those engaged in Iranian offensive cyber operations work within corporate entities (such as IT consultancies) or contractors of Iranian security forces.59 For example, aspects of the Madi espionage campaign

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

implicated the Mortal Kombat Underground Security Team, a small Iranian group that
has attempted to sell spyware and other hacking tools since at least 2008.60 The frequent
overlap of legitimate digital commerce sites and servers used for intrusion campaigns
is demonstrative of these blurred lines—a company might simultaneously provide web
design services for businesses and hack for the government.61
The transition of amateur hackers into contractors for state security agencies is reflected
in basic qualities and patterns of life found across most threat actors. There are clear indications that the threat actors documented are solely Iranians operating inside Iran, not
diaspora Iranians or non-Iranians. At the most basic level, they tend to follow the normal
patterns of life of office workers, being active during

irreverent sense of humor.

Disclosures of aliases and real names, which may be
discoverable because of a disregard for operational
security due to insulation from repercussions or a
lack of professionalism, help reveal both the lives and
the motivations of Iranian threat actors. While those
behind the groups may be nationalists or ideologically aligned with the regime, they do
not appear to be enrolled members of the military or security apparatus. These individuals and groups also differ in social and religious predilections; some participants promote
the use of narcotics and trade pornography on personal social media, while others are
devoutly religious and embed Islamic references in malware code. Iranian threat actors
have often used pornography as bait in their spearphishing campaigns and display an
irreverent sense of humor.

CRITERIA FOR INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT
OF STATE INVOLVEMENT
Campaigns conducted against dissidents and others inside Iran provide the most direct
evidence of government involvement. Whereas it can be difficult to trace the consequences of foreign espionage, for those on the ground the implications are more direct
and tangible.62 As a pattern builds between cyber operations and the offline actions of
security forces, the relationship between both becomes clearer.63 While these cases of collaboration are discernible in only a few threat actors, the patterns support a broader narrative around the intrusion ecosystem.64 Indications that Iranians undertaking offensive
cyber operations are associated with the government include the following:

24

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

•

The campaigns have been conducted based on information that appears to have been
provided by security agencies. In certain cases, the campaigns have been carried out in
coordination with government employees and in advance of the arrest of the target.

•

The targets of such operations align with the sensitivities of the Islamic Republic,
and certain individuals are targeted repeatedly by multiple threat actors over time.

•

Persistent and costly campaigns have been sustained against thousands of targets
without an apparent financial motive and without clear indication of the end use of
the data obtained by intrusion.

In rare cases, potential ties to the government are even disclosed by the participants
themselves. A malware developer associated with the Rocket Kitten group, Yaser Balaghi,
was identified by name based on a pseudonym found in the malware’s code. In a résumé
from 2013, Balaghi listed past information security projects and a history of conducting
hacking projects under contract to an otherwise unnamed “cyber-organization.”65 Balaghi
is not alone in listing his hacking activities on his résumé; still other pseudonyms embedded in malware code used against Saudi Arabia and internal dissidents can be associated
with LinkedIn profiles describing their experience as an “Information Security Researcher” with a “Secret” group.
To add a complication common in cybersecurity research, it is often difficult to distinguish commonplace electronic fraud from politically motivated disruptions and statesponsored surveillance efforts, especially where the attacks are not sophisticated. In at
least one case, Iranians that had staged persistent attempts against U.S. foreign policy
organizations and two European foreign ministries had also maintained infrastructure
linked with commercial banking fraud.66 In another example, the same social engineering
skills used by an individual behind the Iranian Cyber Army defacements also proved successful in a career in the commercial theft of domains and PayPal fraud. More recently,
in an indictment against an Iranian accused of attempting to extort HBO with stolen
copies of unreleased television episodes in the summer of 2017, the U.S. Department of
Justice claimed that the same individual had worked on behalf of the Iranian government
to target military systems and Israeli infrastructure.67
Analyses of Iranian offensive cyber operations often rest on the country’s strict domestic controls as an indication of endorsement—that the government would not allow
something to happen that it didn’t want to occur. However, Tehran’s controls are not so
absolute, and many of the operations could occur surreptitiously given their simplicity.
Cyber activity emanating from Iran could theoretically be conducted without the state’s
sanction, consent, or even knowledge. Daily, millions of Iranians circumvent censorship
using antifiltering tools that allow them to bypass network restrictions and encrypt their

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

25

communications against surveillance. These tools provide space for Iranians to engage
in actions against the government without persecution, and similarly can conceal cyber
activities. Therefore, an Iranian origin does not alone indicate state sponsorship.
Nor does the financial damage resulting from an operation, the political implications of
the campaign, or the number of targets necessarily directly correlate with the probability
of government involvement. The destructive operations conducted against Saudi Aramco
resulted in millions of dollars in damages, yet the malware was unsophisticated and the
attack did not require significant resources, putting the incident plausibly within reach
of a sole individual acting without sponsorship. Such straightforward metrics of harm,
then, are poorly informative of the degree of governmental involvement in cyber activities originating from Iran.

GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND THREAT ACTORS
The coordinated timing of cyber operations with politically motivated arrests are a strong
indication of the Iranian government’s direct involvement. Since at least July 2014 a
pattern has emerged: individuals in the custody of the IRGC are forced to provide access to their online accounts and devices, which are then immediately used to conduct
spearphishing attacks associated with known threat actors.
A vivid example of this coordination is the case of Iranian-American Siamak Namazi, a
forty-six-year-old Dubai-based energy consultant and previously a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, DC. In October 2015, he
was arrested by Iranian security forces months after having had his passport confiscated
while visiting the country. Within hours of his arrest, Namazi’s Google and Facebook
accounts initiated conversations with his wide array of foreign policy and media contacts.
The intruder, pretending to be Namazi, sent contacts an article about the recent nuclear
deal and in poor English solicited edits on the document. This message was accompanied
by an email directing the target to a fake Google site requiring visitors sign in to their
account to view the document, a credential theft attempt connected to Rocket Kitten.
Numerous individuals were compromised in this campaign, including scholars, U.S.
State Department employees, and one prominent journalist whose Gmail account—
which included communications with former U.S. secretaries of state, CIA directors, and
other foreign ministers—was overtaken by the Iranian hackers for nearly two days.68 This
pattern has been repeated in numerous cases involving other Iranians, dual nationals, and
foreign nationals detained in Iran.

26

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Cyber operations have also been documented in preparation for arrests.69 A prominent
example of target selection prior to arrest is the case of Babak Zanjani, an Iranian-Danish
businessman who had been personally sanctioned by the United States and European
Union for involvement in Iranian sanctions evasion. After months of claims regarding his
role in the embezzlement of oil revenue, a process that included a parliamentary investigation, at the end of December 2013 Zanjani was arrested and subsequently charged with “corruption on

Kitten) had acquired access to the confidential information of Sorinet subsidiaries and personnel; however,
it is not clear whether any material accessed during this time was used in the investigation
or prosecution of Zanjani. The case of Zanjani reflects a broader trend witnessed with other
cases; Iranian threat actors frequently pursue online the types of individuals commonly
persecuted by the Islamic Republic offline.
The association between Iranian-origin cyber activities and Iran’s intelligence agencies
is further supported by the fact that the data acquired during such operations is rarely
disclosed. The Navy Marine Corps Intranet breach, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. incident,
and the compromise of State Department employees have all led to the exfiltration of
substantial amounts of highly sensitive information. There is no indication of ulterior
motives, such as fraud, extortion, humiliation, or disclosure to the hardline press.72
The operations required costly infrastructure, including dedicated servers and dozens
of domain names, in addition to personnel time. The activities must have provided
some degree of income to their members, with the primary value being espionage. This
overarching trend points to probable relationships between certain threat actors and the
intelligence agencies, a business relationship that has been revealed when Iranians have
been indicted by the United States for hacking.

CHAPTER THREE

IRAN’S EXTERNAL TARGETS

Given Iran’s inability to effectively challenge or deter better-prepared opponents, it has
employed opportunistic destructive attacks to demonstrate its ability to retaliate. Particularly in the Middle East, Tehran can implicitly threaten cyber operations against the
poorly defended economic and infrastructure resources of its opponents in the event of
hostilities. Indeed, the disclosure of targets and victims of Iran’s regional cyber operations
often include industries that appear to serve no other purpose than creating beachheads
in rival countries, such as banks and airports.
The intended effects of disruptive operations can vary, ranging from intimidation to
destruction for foreign targets, and from embarrassment to existential harm for domestic
opponents. The targeting or compromise of systems can alone be sufficient to communicate Tehran’s willingness and capability to inflict damage on opponents. This echoes Iran’s
occasional threat to close the Strait of Hormuz—through which nearly 60 percent of the
world’s oil supply passes on any given day—during times of crisis. Given the opacity of
the Iranian government, however, the intended messages and expectations being signaled
from Tehran can be easily misinterpreted, risking unintended conflict or escalation.
Such destructive attacks are rare, however, compared to Iran’s espionage campaigns
against foreign governmental and economic institutions. Increasingly these campaigns
form not only the basis of retaliation during conflict but also an essential crisis response
mechanism for handling emerging threats. For example, days after a September 2015
stampede killed over 450 Iranians attending the Hajj pilgrimage, domain names impersonating the Saudi government and Hajj Ministry were registered by known Iranian

29

threat actors.73 As relations and communications rapidly deteriorated between the two
countries, particularly over the fate of a missing diplomat, cyber espionage became an
information gathering tool for Tehran.
Saudi Arabia aside, Denmark, Germany, Israel, and the United States are among the
countries that have publicly disclosed espionage attempts by Iranian groups against their
government, military, or scientific institutions.74 Tehran also targets neighboring countries throughout the Middle East. Despite the various threat actors that operate on behalf
of the Iranian government, their behavior patterns—including whom they target—are
generally consistent over time.

THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE
In September 2012, a group calling itself the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters announced it had begun a campaign of DDoS attacks against the U.S. financial sector. Prior to the campaign, the culprits had exploited vulnerabilities in the software of thousands
of websites in order to create an attack platform under their control. With this army of servers located

Subsequent phases of the campaign were less effective as the financial sector steadily improved its
defenses. By the fourth attempted attack, in July
2013, little visible impact resulted. Still, by the
FBI’s account, Operation Ababil locked hundreds
of thousands of banking customers out of accounts for long periods of time and resulted
in tens of millions of dollars in costs to remediate. An NSA briefing document also made
clear the motivation for Operation Ababil: “[Signals intelligence] indicates that these
attacks are in retaliation to Western activities against Iran’s nuclear sector and that senior
officials in the Iranian government are aware of these attacks.”75

30

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Operation Ababil remains the most destructive Iranian attack on the United States.
While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) alleged that Tehran had electronically surveilled and tampered with the devices of visiting nuclear inspectors in 2011,
little had been known about Iranian cyber espionage prior to 2012.76 That summer provided the first public indication that Iranian threat actors had staged campaigns to spy
on rivals.77 The Madi malware campaign was reported to have compromised up to 800
victims over the course of a year. The countries and
entities targeted were a harbinger of future Iranian
cyber operations, including oil companies, U.S.

email accounts of members of
the American team during the
nuclear negotiations.

Several Western countries have provided evidence of
Iranian cyber operations in indictments and security
reports. In addition to Operation Ababil, Iranians
were alleged to have gained access to the unclassified
Navy Marine Corps Intranet, a system used to store
unclassified information and communications, for several months starting in August
2013.78 In the 2016 edition of an annual Ministry of Interior security assessment, the
German government cited Iran as a new source of cyber espionage against the country,
a disclosure that aligned with reports that the Bundestag had been affected by a malware
operation that targeted visitors of the Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post.79

Overall, however, cases of successful Iranian intrusions into American and European
governmental infrastructure are rare, particularly highly secured, classified networks.
Government agencies are typically hardened beyond the capability of Iranian threat actors to penetrate them. Consequently, Iranians have sought softer U.S. targets, launching
spearphishing attempts on the personal email and social media accounts of U.S. government employees. While personal accounts are less likely to contain classified government
information, they are also less likely to be properly secured, and often contain useful
information such as private material and traces of professional communications.
For example, Iranians attempted to compromise the personal email accounts of members of the American team during the nuclear negotiations.80 Similarly, after the 2016
U.S. presidential election, Iranian threat actors focused on former Obama staff, Republican members of Congress, supporters of Donald Trump’s campaign, conservative
media organizations, and nominees for political appointments in an apparent attempt
to acquire intelligence on the new administration.81 More recently these spearphishing
campaigns have targeted critics of Iran in the U.S. Congress while new sanctions have
been under consideration.

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

31

Tehran tends to target the foreign government personnel and agencies that focus on Iran,
namely those in the United States or Europe who work on Iran policy or within Persianlanguage media, including Voice of America television and Radio Farda. Iranian threat
actors have used the compromised accounts of prominent Iranian-Americans, international businessmen, and other dual nationals arrested by the IRGC to impersonate them
and target the private email accounts of U.S. State Department personnel connected to
Iran policy.
In contrast to the release of private emails by WikiLeaks during the 2016 U.S. election, which leveraged stolen emails for information warfare, Tehran’s compromise of
State Department employees’ emails did not lead to visible sabotage or the disclosure of
embarrassing material. While there have been dozens of attempts to target a wide array of
American politicians and government employees, these intrusions were mostly opportunistic attempts that did not appear to escalate into more sophisticated operations.
Following the 2015 nuclear agreement, the incidence of covert action and retaliatory attacks between Washington and Tehran decreased. Reports of disruptive cyber operations
against U.S. and Iranian infrastructure diminished, as Tehran focused more on domestic
political opponents and regional adversaries, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. Just as Operation Olympic Games provided Washington the ability to coerce Iran without direct
military intervention, Tehran now engages in offensive cyber operations to project its
regional power.

SAUDI ARABIA
No other country appears to have been the subject of as many offensive cyber operations from Iranian state-sponsored threat actors as Saudi Arabia. The two countries are
ethnic (Arab vs. Persian), sectarian (Sunni vs. Shia), and above all geopolitical rivals,
on opposing ends of bloody proxy wars in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen and fierce political battles in Bahrain and Lebanon. Relations between

for purposes of both espionage and disruption. In various reports on Iranian malware
and credential theft campaigns—attempts to acquire passwords or account recovery
information—Saudi Arabia has been one of the most common sources of victims and
targets. This pattern reflects the two countries’ profound geopolitical and ideological disputes (intent), and Saudi Arabia’s continued vulnerabilities in cyberspace (opportunity).
Iran’s August 15, 2012, attack on Saudi Aramco during the Muslim Eid holiday (and a
similar attack against Qatar’s RasGas Company two weeks later) is a prime example of
how Iran uses offensive cyber operations to retaliate against foreign adversaries. As covert

U.S. allies.

To avoid attribution, retaliatory acts were conducted
using cutouts that provided them plausible deniability.
In the Shamoon attack, known by the name given to the
malware, tens of thousands of Saudi Aramco computers
were compromised, causing tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. One group, self-identified as
the Cutting Sword of Justice, claimed responsibility for
the attack, which overwrote the hard drives of Aramco
computers with the image of a burning American flag, causing embarrassment to the
company. Unlike the cyber operations conducted against Iran by foreign entities, the
retaliatory attacks carried out by Tehran sought maximum visibility.

Initial analysis of the incident found that Shamoon was likely inspired by the Wiper malware that had targeted Iran in April 2012, given both destroyed stored data as a method of
sabotage. Tehran was potentially motivated by retaliation for cyber operations against its
oil production infrastructure. Shamoon’s message appeared clear: Iran may not always be
able to defend itself against more advanced cyber capabilities, but it can impose substantial
retaliatory costs against U.S. allies.
The tit-for-tat cycle of covert destructive attacks and symbolic retaliation seen with
Shamoon and Ababil reflects Iranian security tactics witnessed in offline hostilities.
Between 2010 and 2012, for example, several Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated
under mysterious circumstances, allegedly by the United States or Israel.82 In apparent
retaliation, Tehran attempted, unsuccessfully, to assassinate Israeli officials in unexpected
places like Georgia, India, and Thailand. This cycle, a recurrent theme in Iran’s covert

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

33

actions, showed Tehran’s ability to learn from attacks and retaliate in a similar fashion,
providing a potential framework for understanding its signaling and motivations in conducting disruptive cyber operations.83
Compared to Iran’s other adversaries (namely the United States and Israel), Saudi governmental and economic institutions have yet to sufficiently implement systems and protocols
to increase national cybersecurity. Iranian actors have targeted a broad range of economic,
military, and political institutions in Saudi Arabia—including Saudi Aramco and its foreign
partners, the King Faisal Foundation, the Ministries of Commerce and Foreign Affairs,
the Saudi Stock Exchange, and even Saudi Arabian human rights advocates. Researchers
have documented multiple cases in which Saudi companies and organizations were compromised, in one event leading to the exfiltration of vast sums of archival proprietary data
spanning multiple years from one industrial development corporation.84
Weak Saudi cyber defenses have not only made the country vulnerable to Iranian coercion but also made Riyadh a soft target for Tehran’s retaliation against destructive cyber
operations performed by third countries. If Iran cannot cause significant damage to
the United States during times of conflict, then damaging the economic institutions of
American allies will suffice.
The campaign of coercive pressure continues as well: the Saudi Ministry of Defense and
other networks sustained DDoS attacks at the same time as the attack on the embassy.85
When the Shamoon malware agent used in the Aramco incident reappeared in an
updated form (labeled as Shamoon 2 by researchers) from November 2016 to January
2017, it destroyed databases and files belonging to both the government and private
sector, including the General Authority of Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Labor, the
Saudi Central Bank, and natural resource extraction companies.86 Shamoon 2 contained
references to Yemen and overwrote the victims’ hard drives with an image of the drowned
Syrian refugee child Alan Kurdi, once again signaling the attacks were retaliation for
Saudi policies in Syria and Yemen.87

ISRAEL
One of the consistent pillars in Iran’s foreign policy has been opposition to Israel’s
existence and support for anti-Israeli militant groups, such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and
Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Despite this, however, Tehran has been far less successful in
cyber operations targeting Israeli institutions for disruption and espionage. The documents used as bait in the Madi operation were commonly written in Hebrew or referenced Israeli security policies, and researchers have documented fifty-four compromised
entities in Israel during that campaign.88 During the conflict between Israel and Gaza

34

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

in the summer of 2014, known as Operation Protective Edge, authorities claimed that
the Israel Defense Forces’ infrastructure was targeted by DDoS attacks launched by a
wide range of belligerents, including Tehran.89 These DDoS attacks would align with the
known capabilities of Iranian threat actors, including the tactics used against the United
States and dissidents.
Despite a history of DDoS attacks and defacements of Israeli websites, Tehran’s ability
to inflict major costs on Israel through cyber operations has thus far been limited and
perhaps diminishing.90 Given the sophistication of Israel’s cyber defense, Tehran has been
forced to focus mainly on soft targets, for narrow espionage opportunities and the potential disruption of civilian resources in the event of conflict.
Iranian targeting of Israelis, like U.S. nationals, emphasizes individuals focused on Iran
and regional policies. Tehran has engaged in spearphishing attempts against academic
institutions, national security officials, diplomats, members of the Knesset, and Israeli
aerospace companies. Similarly, Iranian actors have commonly created malicious domains that have emulated those owned by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee
(AIPAC) and have targeted employees of both liberal and conservative Jewish organizations in the United States and elsewhere.
While Iran has had some success in compromising smaller civilian institutions, it has not
visibly attempted to use these breaches coercively. The lack of immediate weaponization
of breaches is demonstrative of how strategic calculations shape outcomes. The destruction of banking information or medical data over nonexistential challenges to the Islamic
Republic is perhaps not worth inviting retaliation from Israel (a threat that Saudi Arabia
lacks). Tehran’s desire for signaling a credible retaliatory threat against Israel through offensive cyber operations may also be sufficiently served by the mere compromise of such
institutions. Cyber capabilities have certainly not altered the power dynamics between
Iran and Israel, and the difference in technical capacities likely shapes Iran’s posture
toward its adversary.

REGIONAL ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES
While Tehran’s disruptive cyber operations in the region have primarily targeted Saudi
Arabia, multiple Iranian threat actors have been observed targeting nearly every Middle
Eastern, North African, and bordering country. For example, Magic Kitten successfully
compromised victims across the Middle East and South Asia.91 This pattern has been
repeated during Madi and subsequent operations up to the present.

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

35

Cyber espionage has provided Tehran further insights about its often politically unstable
neighbors. Iranian threat actors have shown a recurrent interest in the infrastructure
of neighboring countries, including Afghanistan’s National Radio, Ministry of Education, and government network.92 Other indicators also suggest an interest in Pakistan’s
and Afghanistan’s security and defense organizations.93 Fictitious social media profiles
and spearphishing campaigns have commonly targeted Iraqis, notably engineers within
telecommunications networks and political elites. Iranian groups have also maintained an
extremely active interest in the political institutions of Iraqi Kurdistan.94
In addition, multiple Iranian threat actors have engaged in spearphishing attempts
against dozens of individuals affiliated with human rights organizations, political movements, and independent media outlets in Yemen, where Tehran is engaged in a proxy war
with Saudi Arabia.95 The Israeli cybersecurity company ClearSky found that 11 percent
of the targets of one Iranian credential theft campaign (Rocket Kitten) in 2015 were
connected to Yemen. These operations specifically support Iran’s position in the Yemeni
conflict, with recent attempts targeting prominent critics of the Houthis, the Shia Muslim group that Iran has been supporting in the country’s civil war.
Iranian actors have also reportedly targeted Syrian opponents of President Bashar alAssad’s regime in limited cases, including exiled Syrian dissidents.96 There has been speculation that Iran has also supported the offensive cyber
operations of its traditional allies Syria and Hezbollah,
notably after Syrian dissidents became the target of

While there are credible indications that Tehran has

the Assad regime apparently didn’t require extensive

indigenous ecosystem of hackers organized by Assad’s
relatives has proven effective at targeting the regime’s
opponents from early into the civil war. Small groups of hackers in Syria have typically used
spyware that is popular among Arab hacking communities against opponents of Assad.
Conversely, while little is known about Hezbollah’s offensive cyber capabilities, in one 2015
report that described their malware and operations, the Lebanese group had seemingly
outpaced its Iranian patron.97

36

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

The lack of external evidence of cooperation does not preclude other coordinated efforts
or intelligence sharing, but basic cyber operations are easier than electronic warfare—such
as signal jamming, radar collection, and signal location—or other military domains that
require a defense industrial base.98 None of the known capabilities or incidents involved
specialized knowledge that required external support, and all have independent profiles on
how their operations are conducted. Iranians have not used the same commodity spyware
as Syrian groups, suggesting that pro-Assad groups owe more to local hacking scenes than
other states. Moreover, Iran’s lack of cooperation with allies or friendly foreign powers may
reflect other factors influencing decisions to share resources. Allies still spy on allies: Iran
could also want to withhold its toolkit to provide some oversight in contentious situations,
such as monitoring the stability and loyalty of the Assad regime.

COMMERCIAL TARGETS
Unlike China, Iran has limited use for commercial espionage given its lack of an industrial production sector that could utilize stolen intellectual property. Iran’s industrial
espionage activities serve to boost its commodities industries and military technological
prowess rather than its domestic manufacturing sector. Nor has Iran attempted to offset
the impact of economic sanctions through large-scale financial crime, as North Korea appears to do.99 Based on public reports and directly observed campaigns, the commercial
entities targeted by Iranian threat actors typically fall into four categories:
•

Aerospace and civil aviation

•

Defense industrial base and security sector

•

Natural resources and extractive industries

•

Telecommunications firms

Evidence of Iran’s interest in the theft of defense secrets comes from several cybersecurity
reports, observed incidents, and U.S. indictments. Nima Golestaneh, an Iranian national
extradited to the United States from Turkey, pleaded guilty to supporting the October
2012 hack of Vermont-based defense company Arrow Tech Associates in an operation to
acquire copies of their weapon system simulations to sell the software to Iranian government and military entities.100 This would prove to be a harbinger of later efforts.
In early 2014, in parallel to targeting Iranian women’s development programs and others,
one threat actor (Flying Kitten) impersonated a website for an aerospace systems conference to spread malware to defense contractors, a tactic still used against the industry

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

37

today. Another Iranian threat actor over the course of 2015 to 2016 repeatedly created
phony corporate websites for Oshkosh Corporation, an American defense company, to
capture credentials from its private internal business network, and continued to target
aviation companies, including jet engine manufacturers and satellite companies. Reports
of attempts of military espionage by Iranian threat actors are extremely common and
include a broad set of industries, most notably aerospace technologies.
Yet these operations appear to have had limited success. Given their involvement in the
defense industry, coupled with related concerns about Chinese industrial espionage,
companies like Oshkosh prioritized information security in ways that NGOs have not.
Consequently, while there is indication that employees are commonly targeted, even
compromised, reports of the theft of highly sensitive defense secrets by Iran are rare.
The targeting of defense companies is also motivated by regional politics rather than
solely theft of military technologies. Several defense industry companies targeted by Iranian threat actors, including Oshkosh Corporation, are substantially involved in providing security and military assistance to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Many of the
American companies—including Oshkosh Corporation—that were designated by the
Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March 2017 under retaliatory human rights sanctions for their involvement with the Israeli military have also been targeted by Iranian
cyber operations.101
As in other areas, it is difficult to derive intent purely from who was targeted or impersonated. In certain cases, it appears Iranian threat actors have compromised Middle
East–based information technology consultants in pursuit of the governments or businesses who are their clients. These operations often target company employees based in
the Middle East, potentially to acquire information on the military capabilities of rivals
or access to other targets (such as supply-chain attacks). One more recent campaign
masquerading as Boeing and Northrop Grumman appeared focused on Saudi Arabia’s
military and commercial aviation sectors.102
Similarly, Iran’s targeting of telecommunications firms, banks, and civil aviation companies could provide them a foothold in critical infrastructure, one that could potentially
cause substantial economic harm and even endanger lives. Thus far, however, Tehran appears to have used such targeting for reconnaissance purposes, mirroring other countries’
cyber activities.103 However, there are legitimate reasons to be concerned that Tehran’s
intention in targeting critical infrastructure is to hold social and economic assets in adversarial countries at risk in the event it needs to escalate or retaliate during conflict.

38

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

CHAPTER FOUR

IRAN’S INTERNAL TARGETS

The history of Iranian offensive cyber operations has demonstrated that the same threat
actors responsible for espionage against the private sector engage in surveillance of human rights defenders, and with considerably more success, given the latter’s resource
constraints. Through the lens of such attacks, the relationship between Iran-originated
cyber activities and the government as well as the motivations for such operations are
made clearer. These communities foreshadow the tactics and tools that will be employed
against other targets, and increased information will enable more effective education and
mitigation strategies.
While the internet has afforded Tehran’s security agencies new possibilities for surveilling
and intercepting the communications of its citizens, concurrent information technologies also limit the reach of the state. Iran was one of the first countries in the Middle East
to connect to the internet, and as a result over half of the population was frequently using the internet as of March 2017.104 Iranian internet users have been quick to embrace
social media and chat applications in large numbers as forums where there are more
social freedoms.
As Iranian citizens have moved their communications to internet platforms hosted outside Iran and protected their communications from eavesdropping by using encryption,
they have also evaded the more traditional means by which Iranian law enforcement and
intelligence agencies perform surveillance.105 Whereas local hosting providers and social
media could be compelled to remove content and disclose account ownership information, platforms hosted outside Iran are beyond the direct reach of the state.

39

The Iranian government has sought to compel foreign firms to comply with requests for
user data, without great success.106 Domestic alternatives to foreign services, supported
by the state under its national internet plan, have failed to attract significant adoption
(Iranian officials themselves tend to use communication tools and social media applications developed in the United States).107 Moreover, millions in the Iranian diaspora—
many of whom left Iran because of state repression—live in countries with no security
cooperation agreement with Tehran and are less inclined to communicate over insecure
Iranian platforms. As a result, in contrast to the first two decades after the revolution,
Iranians’ communications and personal activities are increasingly out of the state’s reach.
This dynamic has fundamentally altered the nature of state controls.
The Iranian government has struggled to respond to the challenges posed by the internet
to the state’s information and communication monopoly. Among their first responses
was mandatory content filtering, which entailed blocking access to any sites considered
pornographic, antireligious, or politically subversive. With the increased availability of
circumvention tools, however, filtering became less effective. Subsequently, basic offensive cyber operations, such as disrupting adversarial sites during the Green Movement,
gave the regime the ability to reassert some control over information flows and project
the illusion of the Islamic Republic’s dominance over the internet.
Iranian cyber operations are highly adaptable as the online platforms and tools used by
the public change. For example, after Iranians shifted to Telegram because of its unfiltered public chat feature and security claims, so too did the attention of Iranian threat
actors. Alongside credential theft operations targeting Telegram users, one threat actor
appears to have gone as far as mapping all the Telegram accounts connected with Iranian
telephone numbers. This information-gathering operation had deeper ties to efforts to
target the chat application’s users and aligned with recurrent arrests of administrators
from critical Telegram groups. This learning process is repeated elsewhere, including for
mobile phones and Macintosh computers.108
Across discrete sets of threat actors and different periods of time, state-aligned offensive cyber operations routinely focus on similar classes of targets, primarily:
1. Government officials
2. Reformist politicians
3. Media professionals
4. Religious minorities
5. Cultural figures
6. Opposition groups, terrorist organizations, and ethnic separatist movements

40

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
Numerous Iranian threat actors have sought to compromise members of Hassan Rouhani’s government, the administration of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and
the state’s bureaucratic institutions. The operations target not only government officials
but also their relatives, including a sustained campaign directed against Rouhani’s immediate and extended family (particularly his brother and adviser, Hossein Fereydoun).109
Magic Kitten, the earliest known threat actor, from the outset engaged in intrusions of
the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting state television network and the Center for
Strategic Research, the think tank research arm within the Iranian government’s Expediency Council that was headed by Rouhani at the time.
Campaigns targeting the Iranian government are ongoing. The targeting of members of
government—individuals that have already been vetted by the regime—reflects the importance of cyber surveillance as a tool of the hardline security establishment to monitor
potential rivals for power and accrue sensitive information about people’s lives that could
potentially be used for blackmail or humiliation.
The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides the most prominent and visible example
of intergovernmental spying. Iranian diplomats have been frequent targets of spearphishing attempts conducted by IRGC-affiliated threat actors since the beginning of the
Rouhani administration. These activities align with accusations in the hardline press that
the nuclear deal betrayed Iranian interests.110 The hacking attempts also mirror a history
of arrests and pressure brought to bear on members of the diplomatic service accused of
spying, including the August 2016 detention of Abdolrasoul Dorri-Esfahani, who served
on Iran’s nuclear negotiating team for the JCPOA.111 Whereas diplomacy requires interacting with officials from foreign governments and external experts, these contacts can
quickly be portrayed as engaging in espionage for foreign powers.
While Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and other figures have been the targets of social
media defacements and threats, the campaigns conducted by the indigenous threat actors
outlined in this report differ in their intent from simple hacktivism or vandalism. The
objective is the collection of personal information from private accounts on international platforms and the monitoring of intimate political and professional networks of
government officials.112 These tactics include the typical credential theft attempts against
personal email accounts seen elsewhere; however, special effort has been made to compromise government officials and their family members through elaborate deception
and by using privileged resources.113 Once compromised, those accounts have been then
turned on their diplomatic contacts and peers. Zarif, and other senior diplomats, have
been repeatedly impersonated and targeted by different IRGC-affiliated threat actors, as
early as 2013 and as recently as February 2017.114

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

41

The diplomatic core is not the only target of intragovernmental spying: several cabinet
officials of the Rouhani administration have had their personal email accounts targeted
and compromised.115 The cyber operations conducted by Iranian threat actors have
extended beyond immediate members of government to target members of the Shia
religious establishment, which undergirds the state’s ideology and political affairs. Campaigns have compromised multiple individuals located in Qom, the center of Iranian
religious matters, including hosts within the Center for Services of Islamic Seminaries
and Islamic Propagation Office of Qom.

REFORMIST POLITICIANS
The accounts of Iranian reformers are a primary target for Iranian threat actors. Though
reformers profess loyalty to the revolution and the Islamic Republic, they favor less state
intervention in society and a less confrontational foreign policy, prioritizing the country’s
national interests before revolutionary ideology. Consequently, they have been increasingly
purged from Iranian politics and there is a media and travel ban against their most prominent leader, former president Mohammad Khatami (who served from 1997 to 2005).116
After the Green Movement, associates of the former reformist presidential candidates
Mehdi Karroubi and Mir-Hossein Mousavi were aggressively targeted by the regime
to try and stifle their activities, even those who had fled under threat of prosecution.
Unwilling to allow a repeat of the Green Movement, the regime tightened information
controls in the run-up to the 2013 presidential election of Hassan Rouhani. Access to
popular anticensorship tools was cut off, and internet speeds were throttled until after
the election results were announced.117 During this time, several Iranian actors began to
concurrently target the accounts of Iranian political dissidents.118 Offline, the families of
international Persian-language media employees were harassed, and reporters inside Iran
were subject to censorship or arrest.119
One of the first known cases of politically motivated hacking in Iran was when the blog
of Mohammad-Ali Abtahi, the former vice minister of the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance under Khatami, was defaced after he wrote about the arrest of bloggers
in 2005.120 Since then, Abtahi has been repeatedly targeted and impersonated by different Iranian threat actors in credential theft and social engineering operations.121 Abtahi’s
experience is emblematic of such group’s priority on reformists. Public figures in the reformist movement from all different segments of society and politics have been targeted.
Not only the overtly repressed activists connected to Khatami, Karroubi, and Mousavi
but former government officials, religious scholars, politicians, and professors.

42

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

The cyber operations against reformists have been broad, successful, and frequent. One
threat actor maintained access to a computer used by a reformist cleric and a deputy at a
prominent Iranian university for months, watching him conduct political operations and
media interviews.122 Similarly, in December 2015 the Facebook account of Gholam Ali
Rajaee, a political activist close to former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was used
to spearphish the accounts of journalists and others.123

lead up to the February 2016 parliamentary election,
particularly those connected to female candidates. The targeting often aligns with offline
pressure from the IRGC and Intelligence Ministry: when the office of one reformist close
to Rouhani was raided in May 2017, he was targeted in repeated spearphishing attempts.
Despite the ascent of moderates to more positions of power, reformists remain a primary
target of the government’s cyber capabilities.

MEDIA PROFESSIONALS
Iranian cyber operations have repeatedly focused on journalists working with reformist
media outlets and international satellite broadcasters that fall immediately outside the
strict state-sanctioned narratives. Multiple Iranian threat actors conducted numerous
credential theft attempts, using fake service notifications, against Iran-based foreign correspondents and Iranian journalists working for prominent publications such as Shargh
and the Iranian Labor News Agency. Similarly, freelance reporters inside Iran are frequently compromised through fictitious personas that send them malware purporting to
be news content. These campaigns have often targeted publications that would later be
closed and journalists who would be detained by Iranian security forces. These incidents
are also often timed with elections, normally periods when the government has more aggressively prosecuted journalists.
The case of Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post’s former correspondent in Iran, is illustrative of state-aligned threat actors’ focus on foreign press working in Iran. Before his arrest
on July 22, 2014, and eighteen-month imprisonment by the IRGC, Rezaian had been
the target of concerted intrusion efforts by Flying Kitten. The threat actor attempted to

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

43

compromise Rezaian’s Hotmail and Gmail accounts on multiple occasions through credential theft attempts launched from fictitious security addresses; these attempts warned
of spam being sent from the account and of other hacking threats. The emails were not
themselves technically sophisticated, as the English used in the messages was poor and
the approach was amateurish. However, the behavior in these incidents was unique in
that Rezaian’s accounts were singled out from a small set of targets several months prior
to his arrest.

RELIGIOUS MINORITIES
Iranian religious minorities are obvious targets of the Iranian security forces, most
notably adherents of the highly persecuted Baha’i faith, who have long been accused of
promoting conspiracies against the Islamic government.124 With the widespread adoption
of the internet, the Baha’i leadership, based mostly in the United States and Haifa, Israel,
enjoyed new organizational and communication opportunities otherwise denied to them
offline. Those same technologies, however, also gave the Iranian state new capabilities for
intelligence gathering and propaganda dissemination against the Baha’i.
In April 2014, the Gmail account of a former director of external affairs for the U.S. Baha’i
organization was accessed from inside Iran. The director had a history of international
advocacy on behalf of the Baha’i Assembly that included testifying before Congress on the
status of religious minorities in Iran. This made her a
natural target for Iran. Fictitious LinkedIn and social
media profiles previously employed against the U.S. deThe ongoing targeting of the

Prominent members of the faith, including the diaspora relatives of imprisoned Baha’i leaders in Iran,
continue to be subjected to sustained cyber operations. Similarly, cutout groups as recently as February
2017 defaced Baha’i sites with pro-regime propaganda coinciding with events such as
the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. The ongoing targeting of the Baha’i and the
defacement of their sites underscores the Iranian regime’s concern with organizations it
perceives as subversive and its use of disruptive attacks to buttress the ideological agenda
of the state.

44

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

The religious targets of Iranian cyber operations have not been limited to aggressively
marginalized groups such as the Baha’is but also include recognized religious communities such as Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and Sunni Muslims. In one example, a
mainstream Jewish community leader in Tehran was compromised through malware and
surveilled as he went about coordinating events and managing a local religious publication. Still other spearphishing campaigns have routinely targeted evangelical Christian
converts, atheists, or new age religious sects. More broadly, a malware campaign posing
as information on the persecution of Christian converts was sent to human rights organizations, and fictitious profiles have posed as religious minorities to infiltrate evangelical
Persian-language networks.125

CULTURAL FIGURES
Iran-originating spearphishing campaigns have also targeted Iranian cultural figures—including artists, musicians, comedians, cartoonists, and satirists—regardless of whether
they reside in Iran or abroad.
These campaigns have included the targeting and compromise of social media and email
accounts for the Germany-based musician Shahin Najafi, multiple pop stars that left Iran
after the Islamic Revolution, a Persian-Israeli singer, and an Iranian-born female metal
musician based in the United States, among others. There have also been intrusions into
devices and accounts associated with less prominent underground artists inside Iran and
networks of fictitious social network profiles connected with Iranian death metal rock
bands and hip-hop groups. These themes of targeting famous pop musicians and their
staff—both inside Iran and abroad—are recurrent and do not focus solely on individuals
critical of the establishment.
Iranian security forces have publicly acknowledged their operations to identify individuals
involved in “immoral behavior” online. In January 2016, several Iranian fashion models
popular on social media were arrested for their activities online and forced to delete their
accounts, an effort labeled by the IRGC as Operation Spider. At the same time, the arrests
of employees of the foreign-based AAA Music television channel led to their social media
accounts being defaced with a message, purportedly from the Ministry of Intelligence,
about the illegality of the network. In interviews with and public statements by those
rounded up in Operation Spider, these individuals were commonly operating openly, and
the defacements were conducted after they were forced to hand over passwords.
Operation Spider was not the first of its kind: the activities of Flying Kitten suggest an
earlier interest in surveillance of the Iranian fashion industry.126 In early 2014, the threat

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

45

actor compromised the computer of a social media model that was popular for portraying a fashionable lifestyle without wearing the state-mandated hijab.127 After the intrusion she retreated offline, stopped logging on to modeling sites, and deleted her Facebook
account. Her image was also appropriated for further operations against other communities. The opaque nature of campaigns such as Operation Spider obscures how Iranian
authorities track down people like online models. However, incidents such as the Flying
Kitten compromise and the infiltration of LGBT-support networks and sex worker social
media communities by others suggest a relationship between both efforts.

OPPOSITION GROUPS, TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS,
AND ETHNIC SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS
Despite its labeling of civil dissent as a threat to national security, Iran does face real
threats of terrorism and organized crime from nonstate actors, evidenced by the self-proclaimed Islamic State’s June 2017 attacks on its parliament and the mausoleum of former
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. While documentation of Iranian
cyber operations by international researchers has typically assumed that all domestic
targets of intrusion campaigns are political dissidents, a small portion of these campaigns
focus on areas in which law enforcement hacking has become internationally normalized,
chiefly in the collection of evidence and intelligence on violent terrorist activities and
financial crime.
For instance, Iranian threat actors have actively sought to compromise the digital operations of Sunni jihadi movements through credential theft, malware, and other intrusions.128 To compromise Islamist organizations, Iranian actors have leveraged bait documents and messages in Persian and Arabic and posed as media organizations such as Al
Jazeera and Al Arabiya. Flying Kitten attempted to spread malware by posting comments
on Al Arabiya’s Facebook page purporting to promote jihadism. These intelligence efforts
have targeted jihadi groups across the Middle East and North Africa, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, including the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, while focusing on Iraqi and Persianlanguage groups.129
Security-related cyber operations extend as well to fringe political organizations that have
previously engaged in hostilities against the Islamic Republic.130 Iranian threat actors
have successfully compromised individuals affiliated with front groups for Mojahedin-e
Khalq (MeK) opposition group, including the Iranian American Society of Texas and
the Simay Azadi television station. These intrusions provided access to private Facebook
discussion groups and intra-organizational planning for MeK rallies, Telegram channels,

46

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

and MeK television programming. Given the MeK’s past disclosures on Iran’s nuclear
program, which the organization has claimed were conducted through an in-country
network of collaborators, these activities also constitute a counterespionage program.
Iranian threat actors also maintain a significant focus on disenfranchised ethnic minorities advocating for greater autonomy. One recurrent target has been Baluchi groups, a
Sunni Muslim population located in both Iran and Pakistan. The news outlets and social
media accounts of Baluchi militant organizations, such as Jundallah, have repeatedly
been targeted by Tehran. These operations include breaching multiple Jundallah affiliated sites as early as July 2010 to push malware to their visitors, a “watering hole attack”
designed to surveil violent separatists that would be of interest to Iranian security agencies.131 In other cases, from a different threat actor, Jundallah was targeted using malware
hosted on domains purporting to be related to the Free Syrian Army and sent in emails
claiming to provide documentation of attacks against the IRGC.

the PKK. Newroz TV was also compromised by the
Flying Kitten malware in 2014, indicating an overlap
not only in the threat actors’ mandates but also in their exact targets. Still other groups
have used fictitious LinkedIn profiles to connect to representatives of the Kurdistan
Regional Government in Iraq. Judging from computer names and other indicators, many
more of those compromised by Iranian malware were in Iran’s Kurdistan province, while
others were found in Iraqi Kurdistan, or among the Kurdish population in Europe.

CIVIL SOCIETY
The internet has facilitated communication and organization between Iranians and
foreign and diaspora organizations, but it has also increased the Iranian government’s opportunities for surveillance and repression against foreign-based operations.
Though many foreign civil society organizations have been the subject of sustained attempts at infiltration and disruption by Iran, few appear to have incurred attacks of such
persistence and aggression as those against the Eurasia Foundation, an NGO in Washing-

of professional networking opportunities.
Eurasia Foundation’s programs and organizational history connect closely with Khamenei’s fears of a Velvet Revolution. It would later launch several more online Persianlanguage programs covering a range of issues, from social entrepreneurship to family law.
The first intrusion attempt occurred shortly after an article was published in the hardline
Iranian newspaper Kayhan in February 2014. It accused the Eurasia Foundation of engaging in social engineering by establishing networks of women and teachers to foment
grassroots economic, political, and social pressure on the regime—all under the direction
of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. State Department. Ten
days after the article appeared, Flying Kitten began its spearphishing campaign against
the Eurasia Foundation. For the next two years, the Eurasia Foundation would continue
to be the target of malware, credential theft, and social engineering by diverse threat actors with diverse strategies.133
The campaign against the Eurasia Foundation is emblematic of Iran’s long and ongoing history of cyber operations against U.S.-based NGOs. U.S. think tanks have been a
focus of interest, with targets such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Council
on Foreign Relations singled out by multiple Iranian threat actors. The same Iranians
that targeted the Eurasia Foundation in December 2015 also impersonated the network
administrators at multiple Washington, DC, foreign policy institutions critical of the
Iranian government to compromise employees.
Nor are these efforts directed only at Iran’s detractors. Organizations advocating improved relations with Iran or nonpolitical researchers have been routinely targeted—the
common denominator appears to be simply a policy interest in Iranian affairs.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

CONCLUSIONS AND PRESCRIPTIONS

While Iran’s offensive cyber operations have required modest resources to develop, they
have allowed Tehran to project itself as an emerging cyber power able to cause significant
harm to its adversaries. The country’s security establishment has used these resources to
signal to domestic and international audiences its ability to confront political subversion
and retaliate against attacks on its infrastructure. These actions have brought international attention to Iran as a considerable force, perhaps beyond its actual capabilities, but
have been ambiguous enough to allow Tehran to portray itself as a victim of the coercive
measures of foreign states.
As judged from evidence of coordination between security agency actions and observed
cyber operations, the campaigns of Iranian threat actors almost certainly have a direct relationship with government entities, specifically the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
and the Ministry of Intelligence. Given this alignment and collaboration, Iranian threat
actors are described here as state-sponsored. However, since the threat actors are commonly private contractors in small security companies, these relationships are sometimes
nebulous and the operators are not integrated into the state’s forces.134
Iranian cyber operations often reflect law enforcement behavior normalized by other
countries in response to advancing information technologies, such as the hacking of
devices to wiretap encrypted internet communications. International standards forums
and telecommunication equipment vendors have legitimized the expectation of lawful
interception of communications, and the Iranian government faces similar challenges of
providing domestic security against terrorist organizations and crime that other coun-

49

tries encounter. These interests are expressed frequently in campaigns, which include the
documentation of persistent targeting of militant organizations—both domestic and
regional—that are hostile to the Iranian government, including Baluchi separatists and
the Islamic State.
With the exception of Saudi Arabia, Iran appears to have had little success in compromising hardened government institutions or well protected organizations. After two
decades of cyber crime, governments and private corporations have developed security
policies and maintain collaborative relationships with external security organizations (for
example, computer emergency readiness teams, or CERTs) that allow them to defend
against attacks. In the office environment, companies can provide dedicated technical
resources, exercise centralized control over devices, offer user education, and install protective network equipment that reduces risk. Such resources enable the private sector and
governments to respond to threats and improve awareness collectively as a community.
Private threat intelligences companies and governmental agencies, such as the FBI’s Cyber
Watch (CyWatch), provide corporations with regular reports on common security risks,
including information on the attacker’s documented tools and infrastructure. The FBI has
produced industry notifications on Iranian intrusion activities based on reports sourced
from the private sector, and U.S. government entities have identified Iranian malware
through information supplied from threat intelligence companies. When multiple computers in the Voice of America’s Persian service were infected by Iranian malware named Infy,
the agent’s origin was identified by network administrators through a private report generated by a threat intelligence company that was made available to the agency.135
Such resources are not readily available to individuals—especially those residing in
Iran—who find themselves alone and unprepared when targeted by even the most
unsophisticated threat actors. While American banks quickly invested in countermeasures that limited the effectiveness of subsequent DDoS attempts in Operation Ababil,
Persian-language social media platforms and media organizations subject to the same
attacks commonly turned off services rather than pay thousands of dollars in bandwidth costs.136 One FBI notice sent to the private sector even documented fictitious
profiles that were also used to target the Baha’i community.137 However, the FBI and
cybersecurity companies do not commonly notify at-risk communities of threats to
their safety and privacy. This divergence and exclusion represents the differences in
opportunities afforded to nongovernmental and noncorporate targets of state-aligned
threat actors.
The increased attention to user security by information technology companies in recent years has directly benefited the targets of Iran. Persian-language digital literacy and

50

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

information security education programs have been developed through foreign assistance
to cater to at-risk audiences, teaching concepts such as password management and how
to recognize social engineering. Widely available account features such as two-factor
authentication, which requires a user to provide a code sent through text message or an
application to log into accounts, have demonstrably made it more difficult for Iranians
to conduct credential theft. Private companies, such as Google and Cloudflare, as well as
government funders, have supported DDoS-mitigation services that provide civil society
organizations with enterprise-level defense resources to protect against such attacks at no
cost, leading to a marked decrease in their frequency.
As a result, a well-educated user with two-factor authentication and an iOS device is a
more difficult target for Iranian threat actors to compromise. However, while technological options for protecting accounts and devices have improved in recent years, in the end
the biggest vulnerability remains the user.
Attempts to forecast the future of Iranian cyber operations are constrained by the secrecy
on the part of the Iranian state about its activities and an uncertain geopolitical climate.
Like most countries, Tehran does not appear to have a clear doctrine as to when it will
engage in disruptive operations and retaliate in cyberspace. Nor is it likely to. In line
with its asymmetric strategies in traditional warfare, Tehran has often benefited from
ambiguity. This may explain why it denies operations attributed to it, as well as why it
did not immediately incorporate threat actors into the military apparatus.
Having been the target of sustained cyber espionage and destructive attacks, Iran is
bound to seek the same capabilities used against it. These capabilities provide Tehran opportunities to impose costs during potential hostilities. While Iran may not appear able to perform synchronized multistage attacks wherever it would like,

DDoS, and other disruptive attacks. Under current
perceptions of Iranian offensive cyber capabilities, it
is unclear that it would be prepared and able to launch attacks against the power grid or
industrial control systems, such as those conducted against Ukraine.138 Instead, attacks
would follow the path of least resistance—targeting state and local governments rather
than federal infrastructure, or unprepared sectors that have not been previously targeted
such as transportation and logistics rather than the financial services. Attempts by one

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

51

Iranian to meddle with a local New York dam and other reports about the compromise
of state agencies are demonstrative of the abundance of opportunities for Iran to retaliate
against the United States.139
Moreover, although Iran has been described as a rational actor, it is not unitary, as the
overlapping operations and intragovernmental surveillance conducted by the Ministry of
Intelligence and IRGC demonstrate.140 The motivations, coordination, and authorization
of Iranian state-aligned campaigns may differ from the policy position of other branches
of government, and the use of offensive cyber capabilities is less visible to observers than
the mobilization of troops. Iran’s security apparatus can easily conduct hostilities in cyberspace without the consent or awareness of the rest of the government.
Disruptive activities conducted by Iranian threat actors have decreased overall since the
interim nuclear deal signed in November 2013—known as the Joint Plan of Action
framework. The rhetoric of government and military officials has also evolved over time.
In recent years, particularly under the Rouhani administration, fewer blusterous statements have been made regarding Iran’s cyber operations.141 While Tehran is less likely to
engage in disruption of American or European infrastructure amid current circumstances, it has engaged in cyber espionage and will continue to do so. The perceived success of
previous campaigns has solidified the principle of offensive cyber operations as an effective means for Iran to continue to conduct espionage and surveillance against regional
adversaries and political opponents.
Yet Iran will continue to be limited by resource constraints for the foreseeable future.
Tehran has rarely appeared able to conduct large-scale exfiltration of classified business
and government data, differing, for example, from Chinese efforts to steal Boeing’s industrial secrets or extensive databases from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.142
What’s more, the threshold of difficulty for compromising such targets will increase over
time, and it is unclear whether Iranian capabilities will improve proportionally.
Iran’s massive brain drain, with many of its brightest engineers leaving for political and
economic reasons, imposes further constraints on the development of its cyber capabilities. Iran’s minister of science, research and technology estimated that 150,000 highly
talented people emigrate from Iran every year, a $150 billion annual economic loss.143
When Iranian engineers leave for Silicon Valley and Europe, the country’s capacity for
effective offensive and defensive cyber operations goes with them.
In the absence of a historical comparison of Iranian cyber operations, new incidents or
the rise of new groups is often incorrectly perceived as a dramatic improvement to capacity. Despite systemic challenges stemming from bureaucratic dysfunction and underinvestment in cybersecurity, Iran has the potential to foster more effective operations.

52

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Attempts by the government, universities, and the private sector to create a professional
cybersecurity community, such as hosting Capture the Flag tournaments, will inevitably
result in a deeper talent pool. Observing other nation-state actors provides a set of benchmarks that can be a reliable indicator of improvement or change in posture, including:
•

coordination of threat actors, more consistent improvement to domestically produced malware, and the development of purpose-built tools that could suggest the
consolidation of capability, specialization of personnel, and even incorporation into
the state;

•

investments in operational security, ranging from reducing the exposure of information on operators to increased investment in concealment (such as Magic Kitten’s
relay network);

•

improvements in background research and foreign language abilities within operations, such as more personalization of social engineering attempts, that would reflect
the inclusion of nontechnical support staff; and

•

execution of operations that include zero-day exploits or target core infrastructure
(for example, compromising network devices, routing protocol hijacks, and telecommunications signaling manipulation), suggesting more investment in resources for
systemic cyber operations.

Despite Iran’s current lack of technical sophistication, simple means can still be effective
at imposing political and economic costs, as evidenced by Russia’s successful compromise
and subsequent leaking of the internal communications of Democratic Party institutions
and operatives before the 2016 U.S. election. Some of the most damaging materials used
in the operation came via a simple breach of a Gmail account, an opportunity available
to anyone. This also reinforces the challenge of discerning intent—what initially appears
as espionage can later turn into an attack.144
Given Iran’s dispersed ecosystem of threat actors, deterring Tehran from engaging in
offensive cyber operations is as challenging as other efforts to address security issues
involving the country. Cyber activities are less likely to lead to regional destabilization
than are offline Iranian threats, and historically, Tehran’s disruptive attacks against nonIranian targets have been retaliation during hostilities rather than instigation toward
new conflicts. To maintain credibility at a time when Western surveillance activities
are publicly exposed through leaked confidential documents, effective policy responses
need to differentiate espionage or signaling from sabotage or the infringement of human
rights, actions that violate international norms. It is also important to recognize that
Iranian offensive cyber operations do not require technology transfers or the support of
other states. Members of Iranian threat actors—primarily low-level software developers

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

53

working within a small number of companies—will continue to be tough to identify,
prosecute, and punish.
Naming and shaming may chill participation in state-aligned operations, especially
among talented individuals looking to travel outside the country or study abroad.
However, it is unclear whether those publicly identified with Operation Ababil or other
campaigns have changed their involvement after being outed. Moreover, the loosely
connected and small groups are not cost-effective targets for retaliatory cyber operations.
In the end, Iran maintains a large enough pool of sufficiently capable programmers to
conduct basic campaigns. Therefore, while exposing Iranian cyber operations and operators may degrade and delay the development of better cyber capabilities, it will not fully
deter Iran.

POLICY APPROACHES TO IRAN’S CYBER THREAT
This leaves a select number of policy options, primarily (1) utilizing existing frameworks
for targeted sanctions or indictments, (2) improving information sharing on threats
across communities, and (3) supporting initiatives to improve information security.
The comprehensive sanctions regime against Iran is unlikely to substantially interfere
with its development of offensive cyber capabilities. Iranians commonly use servers
outside the country, typically hosted on networks in Europe and Russia that provide
service to other cyber crime networks (bulletproof hosting) or registered using false
information.145 Since the resources necessary to improve capacity are organizational and
professional development rather than computers or
infrastructure, there are few technological items or

54

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Where sanctions are appropriate, the U.S. Treasury
Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
maintains targeted programs that can be brought
to bear against international entities that augment
Iran’s capacity for surveillance against its population
(Executive Order 13606146) and those responsible for

cyber operations against American infrastructure (Executive Order 13694).147 Sanctions
and other financial mechanisms could be used to deter foreign countries or other actors
from providing support to Iranian offensive cyber operations. Executive Order 13606
offers an example in its authority to designate any entity, whether in Iran or elsewhere,
that has facilitated the Iranian government in its “computer and network disruption,
monitoring, and tracking.” While the order focuses on human rights, similar language
could focus on Tehran’s attacks against critical infrastructure and espionage. The narrowly
tailored extension of these authorities could help ensure that Iran’s cyber operations do
not benefit from technology transfers or foreign assistance as Tehran expands its security
and commercial ties, especially to countries such as Russia and China.
Additionally, the Justice Department has issued indictments against Iranians implicated
in disruptive campaigns (the same individuals allegedly responsible for Operation Ababil
were also designated under Executive Order 13694) and has successfully obtained the
extradition from a third country of a hacker involved in the theft of military secrets.148
Because of the small operational footprint of the groups, targeted sanctions or legal proceedings are more symbolic than disruptive, but few other opportunities exist to impose
consequences on individuals who participate in operations.
Given the level of rudimentary nature of its cyber operations, a purely political or legal
response that is focused solely on deterring Iran would be ineffective toward addressing
national cybersecurity risks. Any system that can be breached by Iranian groups is equally
susceptible to others with similar sets of motivations, notably North Korea and Hamas.
An effective policy response to the threats posed by Iran must focus on securing critical
infrastructure overall.
Information sharing has been one of the most common strategies pursued by the United
States, Europe, and the private sector to reduce the effectiveness of Iranian cyber operations. After the Aramco attack, the United States used its superiority in monitoring and
attributing Iranian activities to strengthen intelligence relationships with its Arab allies
in the Persian Gulf.149 This is an immensely valuable resource that should be extended
where possible, and further support can be provided to regional allies. Similarly, the FBI
has provided notifications to and facilitated information sharing with the private sector
on specific Iranian campaigns. These efforts can be expanded to include more partners
and to provide data to civil society organizations.
Unlike traditional security issues, private individuals are more exposed to cyber operations owing to the transnational and virtual nature of threats. This brings in more
stakeholders, and increases the burden on individuals to protect themselves from crime
and espionage. Responsibility to protect those users rests equally on the private sector
and governments. Fortunately, internet platforms and communications services, like

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE

55

Facebook and Google, have played a positive role in providing the tools to help individuals defend against attacks—even going so far as notifying users when they have been
targeted by state-aligned campaigns, including those from Iran. These initiatives raise the
bar for attackers and should be seen within tech companies as a core obligation of keeping at-risk users safe.
Discussions about securing dissidents would be incomplete without highlighting the
pioneering role of the United States government and European development agencies
in providing secure communications tools to activists—often referred to as the Internet
Freedom agenda. Government funding has provided early stage investment for researchers and developers to produce prototypes and deployable products to protect activists and
civil society that would not be the focus of the private sector. A significant proportion, if
not majority, of Iranians that bypass the censorship regime do so using safe and reliable
tools funded by the State Department and Broadcasting Board of Governors. Both have
also supported the development of encryption tools such as Signal that have even been
adopted by tech companies within their own messaging applications, demonstrating the
importance of Internet Freedom as a public-private cooperation.
The United States and European Union should continue to promote programs and
norms on internet access and cybersecurity that prioritize the free and secure flow of
information against challenges from countries such as Iran, China, and Russia. Aside
from funding for civil society, this includes promotion of democratic values within
internet governance frameworks, such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). This
also highlights the importance of domestic policy on Internet Freedom efforts: proposals
to weaken information security products such as encrypted messaging applications would
harm individuals in countries where rule of law is weak and backdoor access in communications networks is commonly repurposed for repression.
As the history of Iranian offensive cyber operations demonstrates, the same actors
responsible for espionage against the private sector engage in surveillance of human
rights defenders, and with considerably more success, owing to the targets’ resource
constraints. These at-risk communities provide a canary for the tactics and tools that
will be employed against other targets, and increased information exchange will enable
more effective education and mitigation strategies for all. Policymakers have long understood that the changes that will lead Iran to be a productive member of the international
community will come from within. The safety and security of the Iranian civil society
organizations and democratic voices targeted by government cyber operations should
be recognized and protected as the critical stakeholders within cybersecurity and foreign
policy discussions that they are.

37 The tools and resources developed by Tehran have been almost uniformly described by outside
investigators as unsophisticated, particularly in comparison with malware produced by other state and
nonstate actors. The information security company Mandiant affirmed this observation in a 2014
report: “Mandiant’s observations of suspected Iranian actors have not provided any indication that they
possess the range of tools or capabilities that are hallmarks of a capable, full-scope cyber actor. They rely
on publicly available tools and capitalize solely on Web-based vulnerabilities—constraints that suggest
these cyber actors have relatively limited capabilities.” See: Mandiant, “M-Trends 2014 Annual Threat
Report: Beyond the Breach by Mandiant, a FireEye Company,” accessed December 5, 2017, https://
www2.fireeye.com/fireeye-mandiant-m-trends-report.
38 For example, former representative Peter Hoekstra speculated at a U.S. House hearing that Iran’s
advances in cyberwarfare came from the “cooperation they have with Russia.” Other former and current
officials have commented, often on background, that Russia was a potential partner in warfare. For the
subcommittee hearing on Iran’s support terrorism worldwide, see the following: “Iran’s Support for
Terrorism Worldwide,” Foreign Affairs Committee, March 4, 2014, https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/
hearing/joint-subcommittee-hearing-irans-support-for-terrorism-worldwide/. Elsewhere, claims have
been made by lesser known cybersecurity companies, but these analyses have been flawed and not well
accepted. For more on these flawed analyses, see: Collin Anderson, “Bears and Kittens, and Startup
Cybersecurity Companies,” Medium, May 18, 2017, https://medium.com/@collina/bears-and-kittensand-startup-cybersecurity-companies-5c8e037ea75c.

40 This could be either indicative of the ceiling of Iran’s capabilities or reflective of Iran not facing the sort
of existential threat that would provoke it to use any latent resources in its arsenal. The former appears
more likely.
41 Rocket Kitten and Flying Kitten are examples of how the line demarcating intrusion groups is not
always clear. The structural similarities of certain intrusion tools and the reuse of lesser known infrastructure indicate that parts of Flying Kitten and Rocket Kitten may have had a common heritage,
including common members and shared tools; see: Collin Anderson, “Flying Kitten to Rocket Kitten, A
Case of Ambiguity and Shared Code,” Iran Threats, December 5, 2017, https://iranthreats.github.io/
resources/attribution-flying-rocket-kitten/. In the Shamoon 2 campaign, McAfee attributed unusual
errors to the “involvement of different groups/individuals with different skills, whereas in 2012 we
believe one group was responsible for the attack.” See: Christiaan Beek and Raj Samani, “The State of

disclosed.

the VOA’s account through impersonation with falsified documents sent through a fax.
The intruders were able to find a weakness in a web development server for the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, location, and doing so then gave them access to the internal corporate network. Benjamin Elgin

53 The lack of clarity in the slides is also compounded by the age of the document and could reflect an
arrangement that is no longer in effect. However, within observations of activity, there does appear to be
a clustering of victims, with some samples of the malware agent specifically used to compromise
Lebanese and Qatari victims, but not Iranians or other targets of exclusive interest to Iran.
54 Members of the infamous Ashiyane hacking community and others commonly broke into Arabic media
and U.S. government sites with political messages, such as protesting alternative names for the Persian
Gulf, Western perceptions of Islam, nuclear rights, the administration of George W. Bush, and the
crimes of other countries—often in broken English and always bearing attribution. In a few cases these
campaigns were sustained over longer periods of time and were intended to make a point, especially
when it came to Israeli and Saudi targets. “Al Khaleej Newspaper Website Hacked,” Gulf News, March

formed a company, Andisheh Vesal Middle East Company, to steal software on behalf of the Iranian
government. United States of America v. Mohammed Saeed Ajily and Mohammed Reza Rezakhah,
unsealed July 17, 2017, https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/982106/download.
For those on the ground the threats posed are more complex and multifaceted. For example, Iranian
telecommunications firms appear to have cooperated with the government in order to provide access to
the recovery and two-factor authentication codes sent by text. These then allowed access to Google,
Telegram, and other accounts on foreign platforms.
The most significant counterevidence of state-alignment is that when the Infy group was disclosed by
Palo Alto in May 2016, the domains used in the communications of the malware were filtered by the
censorship apparatus, blocking access to those victims. There are explanations for this action that would
not conflict with the theory that Infy was acting on behalf of the government, including that the
censorship was intended to hide evidence of the operation from the Iranian public.
Specifically, we observed direct interactions between the Iranian state and the groups Charming Kitten,
Flying Kitten, Magic Kitten, and Rocket Kitten. More tenuous links exist for Infy based on this criteria.
“Rocket Kitten: A Campaign With 9 Lives,” Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., November 9,

The incident was orchestrated by a threat actor who had registered domains under cmprus1394[@]

activity.

A dual national who had previously worked with a foreign broadcaster was arrested two weeks after his
email was also compromised after a phishing attempt. According to one account, the attacker attempted
to extract a ransom to keep the victim’s private information, which was ignored. Then, after the arrest,
the accounts were again used to target others.
“Iranian Billionaire Babak Zanjani Sentenced to Death,” BBC News, March 6, 2016, http://www.bbc
.com/news/world-middle-east-35739377.
These intrusions reflected a studied understanding of Sorinet’s operations and included names such as
“Baharak Zanjani” that appear on the corporate registrations of the company’s subsidiaries but are
believed to be false identities. See article in Farsi, Young Journalists Club, February 2, 2013, http://

%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C.
Iranian security and intelligence agencies have however frequently used blackmail and humiliation to
intimidate or coerce individuals, including BBC Persian journalists. It is possible that material compromised through intrusions has been used for political manipulation, as this would be difficult to observe
without acknowledgement from the victim. For examples of blackmail threats, see: Elise Knutsen,

be targeted by an Iranian hacktivist group, calling itself Parastoo, in November 2012, when a web server
was compromised, and the information on its employees was posted online, with the implied threat of
another Aramco attack. For Parastoo’s statement, see http://cryptome.org/2012/11/parastoo-hacks-iae

First disclosed by Kaspersky Lab and Seculert in July 2012; see “The Madi Campaign – Part I,”

“otahare.” It seems more likely that the inclusion was not meant as a religious declaration.

105 For example, the mobile chat applications and voice over internet protocol (VOIP) services, such as
Viber, Skype, and Telegram, that became popular replacements for standard telephony and text
messaging bypass the lawful interception capacities traditionally embedded in phone systems.
106 One significant example is Telegram, which has reached over 40 million users in Iran as of 2017. As a
result of its use of encryption, it is not susceptible to the filtering of specific content or keywords. While
both Iranian authorities and Telegram have never been fully forthcoming about their relationship, it is
clear that the former has attempted to incentivize and threaten Telegram into complying with requests
for the removal of content—including briefly blocking the service in October 2015. While it appears
that Telegram does take down pro–Islamic State content, it has not thus far complied with other
requests.

109 Fereydoun has been the target of a corruption investigation, which has been perceived as an attempt to
undermine Rouhani. Regardless of the legitimacy of these claims, the attempts against Fereydoun began
early in Rouhani’s first term and targeted his family. This extended into impersonating Zarif to target
Fereydoun and vice versa. The long-term focus suggests the targeting was related to politics rather than
the criminal investigation.

has become particularly adept at using the internet for international advocacy and countering exclusion,
including offering online distance learning classes from the Baha’i Institute for Higher Education.

128 FireEye (through its iSIGHT Partners) has also noted that threat actors focused on the Islamic State as
the militant group was expanding its territory across Iraq, an interest expressed by the threat actors well
before 2015. David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, “Iranian Hackers Attack State Dept. via Social
Media Accounts,” New York Times, November 24, 2015, http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/world/

129 In one case a shared computer in Erbil, Iraq, used by a Kurdish supporter of a Jordanian jihadi figure
was compromised through the malware, which was delivered as personal pictures sent by a fictitious
female social network profile. The same group maintained phishing sites with hard-coded references to
Facebook pages associated with the Islamic State’s “Ministry of Information,” Tunisian Islamic Awakening, Lashkar-e-Khorasan (Pakistan), and al-Qaeda affiliates, among other Islamist movements. This
targeting was broad, but more effort was spent on Persian-language or Iran-oriented actors, targeting
Facebook pages as small as one with five members and one public post, a “Salafe Kurdistan” page.
130 The operations reflect old rivalries from the Islamic Revolution being played out, as Flying Kitten
sought access to accounts and sites associated with Marxist-Leninist Fedaian and other Communist
parties as well.
131 Some of the first observed operations of the Infy group targeted Taftaan News Agency and the Jonbesh­e
Moqavemat­e Mardomi­e Iran separatist group, and compromised computers in the province of Sistan
and Balochistan over the course of several years. Shortly after the suspected time of intrusion, at least
one of the affected blogs warned its visitors that an old email address connected to the site had been
compromised by Iranian intelligence agencies. The following day the administrators closed the site,
claiming technical issues.
132 Several Infy malware samples had names such as “pjak.pps” and other references to Marxist ideologies
(such as “kargar.pps,” or “worker”).
133 For example, current and former employees of the organization, both with the Iran Program and
general operations staff, have been engaged by several fictitious personas on LinkedIn and Facebook,
including the persona “Victoria Roberts,” the LinkedIn profile name described earlier as connecting
predominantly with defense companies. The existing networks of these profiles reflect a specific interest
in the American foreign policy establishment, international development programs, and the defense
industrial base.

134 Healey defines “state-integrated” as the “national government integrates third-party attackers and
government cyber forces, with common command and control.” This still allows for informal coordination with external parties so long as the government remains in control. While Iranian threat actors
receive tasking from the government, there is little indication that any of them are formal members of
the security forces.

137 An FBI notice sent to private industry on May 29, 2014, described a similar set of personas that
expanded on the iSIGHT Partners’ (now FireEye) Operation Newscaster report that was released a few
days prior. While iSIGHT Partners identified fourteen accounts of American or European background,
the FBI provided a list of fifty-six unique personas, of which fifteen had family names that appeared to
be Persian and had not been identified in the previous report. The accounts identified by the FBI have
been since deleted, but appeared to have been Iran-focused. Federal Bureau of Investigation, “FBI

141 For example, when Iranian state–aligned media have covered such issues in recent years, it has typically
been through republishing English-language reports without substantial further comment or by
reporting on denials by the government, such as when Mashregh News covered Citizen Lab’s August
