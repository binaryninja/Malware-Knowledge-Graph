Red Team
FireEye is on the front lines defending companies and critical infrastructure globally from
cyber threats. We witness the growing threat firsthand, and we know that cyber threats are
always evolving. Recently, we were attacked by a highly sophisticated threat actor, one
whose discipline, operational security, and techniques lead us to believe it was a statesponsored attack. Our number one priority is working to strengthen the security of our
customers and the broader community. We hope that by sharing the details of our
investigation, the entire community will be better equipped to fight and defeat cyber attacks.
Based on my 25 years in cyber security and responding to incidents, I’ve concluded we are
witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities. This attack is different
from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years. The

attackers tailored their world-class capabilities specifically to target and attack FireEye. They
are highly trained in operational security and executed with discipline and focus. They
operated clandestinely, using methods that counter security tools and forensic examination.
They used a novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past.
We are actively investigating in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
other key partners, including Microsoft. Their initial analysis supports our conclusion that this
was the work of a highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.
During our investigation to date, we have found that the attacker targeted and accessed
certain Red Team assessment tools that we use to test our customers’ security. These tools
mimic the behavior of many cyber threat actors and enable FireEye to provide essential
diagnostic security services to our customers. None of the tools contain zero-day exploits.
Consistent with our goal to protect the community, we are proactively releasing methods and
means to detect the use of our stolen Red Team tools.
We are not sure if the attacker intends to use our Red Team tools or to publicly disclose
them. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we have developed more than 300
countermeasures for our customers, and the community at large, to use in order to minimize
the potential impact of the theft of these tools.
We have seen no evidence to date that any attacker has used the stolen Red Team tools.
We, as well as others in the security community, will continue to monitor for any such activity.
At this time, we want to ensure that the entire security community is both aware and
protected against the attempted use of these Red Team tools. Specifically, here is what we
are doing:
We have prepared countermeasures that can detect or block the use of our stolen Red
Team tools.
We have implemented countermeasures into our security products.
We are sharing these countermeasures with our colleagues in the security community
so that they can update their security tools.
We are making the countermeasures publicly available in our blog post, "Unauthorized
Access of FireEye Red Team Tools".
We will continue to share and refine any additional mitigations for the Red Team tools
as they become available, both publicly and directly with our security partners.
Consistent with a nation-state cyber-espionage effort, the attacker primarily sought
information related to certain government customers. While the attacker was able to access
some of our internal systems, at this point in our investigation, we have seen no evidence
that the attacker exfiltrated data from our primary systems that store customer information
from our incident response or consulting engagements, or the metadata collected by our
products in our dynamic threat intelligence systems. If we discover that customer information
was taken, we will contact them directly.

Over many years, we have identified, cataloged, and publicly disclosed the activities of many
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, empowering the broader security community to
detect and block new and emerging threats.
Every day, we innovate and adapt to protect our customers from threat actors who play
outside the legal and ethical bounds of society. This event is no different. We’re confident in
the efficacy of our products and the processes we use to refine them. We have learned and
continue to learn more about our adversaries as a result of this attack, and the greater
security community will emerge from this incident better protected. We will never be deterred
from doing what is right.
