Tue 19 November 2019 in Ransomware
No flashy wallpapers or other bells and whistles, but if you aren't careful and maintain
backups as you should DeathRansom will take your data with it to its grave. Or will it ?

A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below
will lead to the encryption of your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check
with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources might be illegal depending
on where you live.

The plain text note doesn't look that special. I'll be refering to this strain as Deathransom,
since the Wacatac Trojan doesn't seem to be affiliated with the sample.

1/10

The "Wacatac" Registry Keys are most likely an attempt at a false flag manouver. The
Ransomware will set three Regkeys in total: The main Key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Wacatac and two sub keys called private and
public. The hex value set in the "private" acutally corresponds to the Lock ID referenced in
the Ransomnote. Analysing the encryption loop will probably present the relation between
these values, so I'll keep going.

2/10

Somewhat of a rare occurance, but Deathransom will actually take out the trash for you by
clearing the recycling bin.

3/10

Generally this sample seems to be very limited in features, but let's see how they
implemented the encryption routine. Looking for CreateFileW we can see that it appends the
.wctc extension to the name of the current file. But where's the encryption happening? Either
they hid it very well or they just plainly forgot about it

ðŸ¤”

Let's just fire up a VM and see what happens to the files after the encryption takes place so
we have a better idea of what to look for. I got no UAC prompt upon running the sample and
the ransom process seemed a bit fast. Checking out the sample files we can see what
actually happened:
4/10

Exactly, nothing. I don't want to jump to conclusions here, but this strain might still be in the
testing stage or is just a plain hoax. Regardless it is still possible that another variant turns
up that will actually encrypt the files.

Update 25.11.2019:
As predicted there is another version of the Ransomware available now and it seems to do
its job a lot more thorough than its predecessor. The new build doesn't seem to append a
new suffix to the file and the ransomnote has been adapted slightly because it now features
a Bitcoin wallet address and a new E-Mail contact.

fedb4c3b0e080fb86796189ccc77f99b04adb105d322bddd3abfca2d5c5d43c8

Entropy-wise the sample doesn't seem to be packed and nor are there any weird sections or
paddings. Compiler and Linker Versions point towards Visual Studio 2013 being utilized by
the creators.

5/10

Looking at the packets captured during the dynamic analysis we notice a DNS request plus
TCP traffic to iplogger[.]org which was not present in the first Version of the Ransomware.
Looks like the criminals are trying to track infections over time.

According to Blockchain.com the Bitcoin Wallet mentioned in the V2 Ransomnote doesn't
have any transactions on it as of the 30th of November, which is really good news :)
