Introduction

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Introduction

Swisscom’s 2019 Cyber Security Report has been published.
Based on the threat situation, which we have updated once
again this year, we have taken a more detailed look at a
topic that is currently of particular concern to the security
community within Swisscom, to our partners and customers,
but also internationally: APTs.

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) involve attackers
with a large amount of resources attacking a clearly
defined target to obtain specific information or
cause lasting damage. To explain the relevance of this
adversary type we have compared APTs to other threat
actors such as cyber criminals, terrorists and hacktivists.
What sets APTs apart from other actors?
Whereas criminals take the path of least resistance to
generate as much profit as possible, both terrorists
and hacktivists use attacks for publicity but have few
resources and little know-how, APTs proceed much more
subtly. The target is selected carefully and monitored
over months or even years. Seemingly boundless
resources are used to build up know-how and develop
suitable tools. In addition, great care is taken to maintain
the outmost secrecy, during and after the attack so
that neither the attacker nor the target can be discovered
too soon.

The report describes attackers’ motivations and their
resources. Based on data collected and evaluated by
Swisscom, it shows which methods and tools attackers use most frequently. We will also highlight which
countermeasures are particularly effective and which
countermeasures offer the best detection capabilities.
We are very pleased that we were able to win Costin Raiu
from Kaspersky’s GReAT for an introductory interview.
Costin is a world-renowned expert in the field of APTs
who was happy to share his knowledge with us.
This report is a joint work between different departments within Swisscom.

Status Report – Threat Radar

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Threats arise out of the constant
development of new technologies
and their application and spread
across society.

Potential threats must be detected at an early stage and documented systematically. To illustrate the threat
situation and its evolution, we use the familiar radar to which we have already referred in previous publications
of of Swisscom’s Cyber Security Report.

Status Report – Threat Radar

Methodology
The threat radar is broken down into seven segments
that differentiate between the various threat domains.
The threats belonging to each of these segments will
be assigned to one of four concentric rings. These rings
indicate a threat’s actuality and thus also our estimation
of probability in assessing such threats. The closer the
threat is to the centre of the circle, the more relevant is
the threat and more important is it, to take appropriate
countermeasures.

We refer to the rings as:
• Urgent issues: Threats that are being executed wide
spread and are binding large amounts of resources.
• Main topics: Threats that are detected still rarely and
are countered with a normal deployment of resources.
Often, defined processes already exist to efficiently
defend against these threats.

8–9

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

• Early detection: Threats that have not yet been carried
out or whose impact is currently very small. Projects
have been launched with the goal of addressing the
growing significance of these threats at an early stage.
• Observation: Threats that may occur in the next years.
No concrete measures have been defined for handling
these threats.
Moreover, the individual threats indicated by the aforementioned points show a trend which may be of increasing, decreasing or stable criticality. The length of the
trend beam indicates how swiftly the threat’s criticality
is expected to change.

Threats
The following is a brief description of the
seven segments of the threat radar.

Dominant
Players

Technology
Dynamics

This segment covers threats arising through dependencies on dominant manufacturers,
services or protocols.
Urgent issues

Infrastructure Integrity: Key components of critical infrastructure may
have had vulnerabilities built into them, whether through negligence or
maliciously, which endanger the security of the system.

Main topics

Destabilising Centralisation: Strong centralisation in the structure
of the Internet leads to cluster risks. The breakdown of one service,
e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS), can have a global impact.

This term covers threats arising from the fast pace of technological innovation, which both
creates new threats itself and also offers attackers new avenues for attack.
Main topics

Targeted Attacks: Targeted and complex attacks designed to reach a
specific goal. This threat type is explained in greater detail in later sections
of this report.
All IP: The nationwide rollout of All IP also increases the risks associated
with VoIP technology.
5G Security: 5G is still a young technology and its launch will not only offer
many new opportunities but will also open the door to unknown threats.
Ransomware: Large amounts of critical data are encrypted and only
(possibly) decrypted in exchange for the payment of a ransom.

Early detection

Automation & Scaling: Greater automation of technical operations will
mean that the repercussions of successful attacks and misconfigurations
will be greater.
Increased Complexity: The complexity of systems, especially across
technological and corporate borders, is on the rise. This increases risk
exposure and hampers troubleshooting.
Quantum Computing: Quantum computers can render existing cryptographic methods useless because they can crack them in no time.

Status Report – Threat Radar

Cyber goes
Physical

This term covers attacks on infrastructure conducted from cyberspace, which will
increasingly cause damage in the physical world.
Main topics

Organisation

Organisational threats arise through changes in the organisation or exploit weaknesses in
an organisation.

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Main topics

10 – 11

Physical

IoT Devices: Devices with weak protection could be compromised or
sabotaged. This could restrict their own functions, including their
availability or data integrity.
SCADA: There are many technical control systems for critical infrastructure, which are poorly protected and not well maintained.

Infrastructure Misconfiguration: Exploitation of misconfigured infrastructure components and vulnerabilities that are identified too late and
patched late.
Workplace Diversity: Aside from the many opportunities that new working
models bring, an uncontrolled use of such models, e.g. “bring your own
device” (BYOD) or the increased use of remote workplaces, exposes
companies to greater risks.
Insider Threats: Partners or colleagues manipulate, misuse or sell
information, either through negligence or for malicious intent.
Decentralised Development: Classic pure development departments
disappear. Application development merges with the operations
departments and move closer to the business units. Release cycles are
getting shorter.

Threats that arise from the physical environment that are generally more focused on
physical targets.
Main topics

Device Theft: The theft of devices – especially critical infrastructure
components and, increasingly, IoT Devices – may result in a loss of data or
impair service availability.
Drones and Robots: Reconnaissance and attacks over longer distances will
become easier and cheaper.

Observation

3D Printing: Improvements in the quality of 3D printers will make it
cheaper and easier to create e.g. keys and other physical devices.

Proliferation

Threats that benefit from ever easier and cheaper access to IT media and know-how
are known as proliferation threats, because this creates new potential ways of attack:
It also increases the availability of tools that can be used for attacks.
Main topics

Subscriber Compromisation: Malware attacks mobile users’ private data or
is used to attack telecommunication or IT infrastructure.

Early recognition IoT-Based DDoS: Strong growth in the number of IoT Devices coupled with
low-level protection creates more “takeover candidates” for botnets.
Digitalisation: The growing interaction between the virtual and real world
as also private and corporate environments create new ways of attacks.

Environmental/
Social

This covers threats that arise out of socio-political change or which are either facilitated or
become more valuable to attackers.
Urgent issue

Security job market: Great difficulties of meeting the demand for security
professionals mean that not enough expertise is available to counter the
increasingly complex and intelligent attacks.

Main topics

Digital Identity: Trusted personal digital identities may be misused or
stolen, e.g. to conclude contracts under the names of others.

Early detection

AI/Analytics: More data and better analytical models provided by AI can
be misused to influence people’s behaviour. Decisions are increasingly left
to autonomous systems.
Political Influence: Political trends can influence technological or economic
decisions, e.g. in the selection of technology suppliers. This can create
new risks.

Status Report – Threat Radar

Conclusion
The threat situation remains complex. Attackers are
profiting from the increasing value of virtual assets,
which thus further motivates them to launch a targeted attack. In addition, technological innovations and
the convergence of the physical and virtual worlds are
creating new opportunities for attacks. However, it also
shows that no specific threat is developing, but rather
that threats are subject to fluctuations and trends.

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Compared to last year’s picture, we can say that
the threat situation has remained stable. Although
some threats, such as Infrastructure Misconfiguration
and Workplace Diversity, have declined this year,
most still exist and are changing only minimally.

Threats via SCADA (industrial control) systems and
IoT (Internet of Things) Devices remain in the main focus,
but we do not see any short-term changes. IoT penetration is not yet high enough to further exacerbate the
threat situation.
Drones, on the other hand, are currently becoming more
widespread, with the associated negative consequences,
some of which have also been reported in the media.
For this reason, we currently see a strong trend towards
a worsening threat situation.

For both declining threats, we attribute the “relief” not
to falling interest by potential attackers, but rather to
the increased maturity of the affected infrastructures.
Workplace diversity, for example, is actively being
managed at more and more companies, mobile device
management (MDM) tools are being used and directives
for the use of “bring your own device” (BYOD) are
being developed and implemented.

12 – 13

The threat situation remains
complex. Attackers are profiting
from the increasing value of
virtual assets, which thus further
motivates them to launch a
targeted attack.

Interview Costin Raiu

We were given the opportunity to ask Costin Raiu six questions about APTs and to benefit from
his experiences and observations as an expert on the subject.

1. Costin Raiu, what are the primary characteristics that make up an
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?
In our opinion, this is what makes a malware or attack advanced:
• the usage of a zero-day exploit as seen with Sofacy, also known as APT28, Pawn Storm
or FancyBear. This is probably a champion among all when it comes to the number of
discovered zero-days.
• a highly complex, modular platform to carry out various functions such as Regin and
ProjectSauron.
• The usage of sophisticated techniques for infection, persistence or exfiltration.
For instance, RedOctober used a very clever persistence mechanism in the form of
an Office and Adobe Reader plugin, which has the ability to execute code hidden in
specially constructed documents; this also includes various bootkit techniques.
Other characteristics are Slow replication, coupled with network level persistence, Infection of
pro-level network hardware such as core routers and supply chain attacks.
Good examples of how those attacks have been performed are Duqu2, SYNful Knock or
Shadowpad and CCleaner compromise.
This list is non-conclusive. Other examples are attacks on hardware features, infection of
the BIOS, destructive attacks against hardware with Stuxnet as a prominent example or
multi-platform malware.

2. What are the most significant changes in APT activity that you are
observing and what areas are primarily affected by these changes?
We are tracking over 100 APT groups and operations at the moment. We started tracking
APT groups on a regular basis in 2010, after the story of Stuxnet, and when it became clear
this was a trend, we decided to continue. Since we reached knowledge about 100 APT groups
and operations in 2015, around the same time we launched our private APT reporting service.
We also observe more and more APT groups engaging in fileless attacks. This makes it more
difficult to detect infections, as no malicious files can be found in the system. Additionally,
we are seeing an increasing number of groups adopting public tools such as Empire Powershell, Metasploit, Cobalt Strike or Mimikatz. It makes it difficult to distinguish between them.

Interview Costin Raiu

3. What was the most interesting APT that you have analysed?
Probably Duqu2. First of all, we thought Duqu2 was special because it was used to target
Kaspersky Lab. The idea of an APT targeting a security company is a pretty bold one, because
it’s impossible to assume the intrusion will not be detected. Secondly, Duqu2 was rather
special in the sense it was a memory-only threat, which, while running, existed only in the
memory of several computer systems, without artifacts on disks. This complicated its
detection a lot. Finally, the usage of a zero day in Windows to bypass Kaspersky products
seemed quite interesting and resulted in several product improvements to detect such
behavior in the future.

14 – 15

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

4. What are typical mistakes organisations do in order to be prepared
for an APT attack and how they respond to an APT?
Most organisations focus on preventing an external attacker from getting access to internal
resources, but few take measures to detect an attacker once he/she has access to the internal network. As I know from our research, attackers spend most of their time with lateral
movement and exfiltration. So the organisations should focus on this phases. Also, lack to
implement the Australian DSD TOP351 mitigation measures against APTs.

https://acsc.gov.au/infosec/top-mitigations/mitigations-2017-table.htm

5. What are the typical mistakes attackers do during their operations?
Where do you see organisations getting an advantage over their
adversaries?
Often, we recognise Opsec mistakes such as VPN fails, forgotten PDB paths in binaries or
compilation timestamps.

6. What are the most important capabilities to have to be prepared
for APT large-scale intrusions?
For companies, it is essential to have access to private threat intelligence, having a fully
operational Security Operation Center, implementing network filtering and a detection of
lateral movement and exfiltration mechanism. Also, organisations should know and
deeply understand how attackers work. For example, which tools they use and how they
operate during the attack phases. Most of them use Mimikatz, Powershell and Webshells.

Components of Targeted Attacks

Components of Targeted Attacks

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Depending on the threat actor,
the mission or strategic goal
of an attack will have completely
different intentions, and threat
actors have a wide range of
ways to put them into practice.

The media often report that companies have been
infected with a specific type of malware or that a specific type of malware has been used to steal a company’s
data. To understand targeted attacks, we must be
aware that it is not the malware that is carrying out
the attacks, but that businesses are being attacked by
people. These are often referred to in the cyber community as threat actors or cyber operators and are the
main component behind such attacks. The threat actors
behind targeted attacks do not carry out these attacks
indiscriminately, but have a strategic goal, a wide variety
of motivations and diversified approaches, which serve
as additional components of a targeted attack and are
detected as it progresses.

2

The Threat Actor Landscape
Depending on the threat actor, the mission or strategic
goal of an attack will have completely different intentions, and threat actors have a wide range of ways to put
them into practice. For better orientation and to assess
the potential and motivation of different threat actors,
we divide them into the following groups:

Targeted attacks by advanced persistent threats
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) constitute the top
tier of cyber threat actors. Targeted attacks by an APT
are conducted based on a mission that aims to gain a
strategic advantage in order to achieve political ends or
positively influence technology developments. In this
context, an APT is assumed to be a government or an
entity that acts on a government’s behalf. The special
feature of an APT is that the attacks associated with
it are considered “state-sponsored,” which explicitly
means that the threat actors are condoned by the state
and thus represent “legal” (or at least state-protected)
hackers. State legality, difficult traceability and relatively
risk-free implementation have led more and more states
to expand their cyber capabilities and APT attacks.2

https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/news/20180724-economic-espionage-pub.pdf

Components of Targeted Attacks

In addition to such “legal” APTs, there is another
fringe group that can be seen as pioneers of states/
governments that have not yet developed the capabilities to carry out advanced attacks such as those of an
APT themselves. At the latest since the hacking team
revelations of hacktivist Phineas Phisher, it has become
clear that this fringe group pursues clear financial and
strategic goals.3

18 – 19

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Targeted attacks by cybercriminals
Cybercriminals are primarily opportunistic and use all of
their available capabilities (e.g. a published exploitation
of a Microsoft Office vulnerability) against a wide range
of targets. Whenever they receive a capability, they use
it against many opportunistic targets to profit from as
many attacks as possible. In addition to opportunistic
attacks, there are also targeted and well-organised cyber
criminal attacks that aim at stealing large amounts of
data or other assets from a defined target through a
single attack and turn this into money. For this attack,
the actors typically need to spend a significant amount
of time inside of the target network. Such organised
criminals are often just as technically skilled as many
APTs. However, the decisive difference lies in the threat
actors’ strategic objectives.

Targeted attacks by terrorists
Whereas fear is widespread among the general public
that terrorists will attack critical systems, not a single
case has been reported thus far in which terrorists have
pursued and achieved their strategic goals through
targeted cyberattacks. In fact, the Cambridge Centre for
Risk Studies knows of no non-state terrorist group that
has developed the ability to carry out advanced, targeted
cyberattacks which could cause physical damage.4 At the
same time, the 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment by
the US intelligence community concludes that terrorists
primarily use cyberspace for media purposes.5
We still assume that cyber terrorism remains a threat
and will play a greater role in the future.

Targeted attacks by hacktivists
Hacktivists typically carry out targeted attacks for
political motives as a form of protest. They congregate
globally in groups of like-minded individuals in order to
coordinate and carry out attacks. Alternatively, they may
carry out attacks on their own. The skills of hacktivists
vary greatly. The aim is to reach the chosen strategic goal
as quickly as possible and attract a lot of media attention. So far, it has been noted that these threat actors
primarily perform smash-and-grab operations in order to
publicise their success as quickly as possible.

Targeting
The targets of targeted attacks are not chosen
randomly, but based on the specific relationship
between the target and the adversary.

Targets of Interest
The more a target satisfies the needs of an adversary the
more it becomes a Target of Interest (TOI). The primary
aspects describing a TOI are the unique ability to satisfy
the need of the adversary, the required effort and cost
associated with conducting the attack, as well as the
risks it may pose to the attackers.

Targets of Opportunity
A Target of Opportunity (TOO) is of secondary importance. Such targets meet a threat actor’s subordinate
needs and might be attacked as a bridge to the actual
Target of Interest. However, it is also possible that the
target was compromised because it was vulnerable
to a particular exploit at a specific moment in time.
The Target of Opportunity can also become the Target
of Interest if the threat actors later discover that the
victim is of higher value than initially concluded.

The more a target satisfies the
needs of an adversary the more it
becomes a Target of Interest (TOI).

Conducting the Attack

Conducting the Attack

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

There are many ways to describe a cyberattack. We have
chosen the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is based
on data from attacks that have been observed in real
world intrusions. ATT&CK is similar to the cyber kill chain7
method for describing cyberattacks8. Whereas the cyber
kill chain provides more of a helicopter perspective, the
ATT&CK framework details the activities of more than
80 threat actors (groups). ATT&CK primarily contains the
activities of advanced persistent threats in the different
attack phases, described on the basis of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)9 of these threat actors.

Our analysis of the data was carried out over a period
of several weeks via ATT&CK Enterprise10 (hereinafter
referred to as “ATT&CK”), the last access being in January
2019. ATT&CK is continuously extended and updated.
However, the data gathered by the framework and
the experiences of Costin Raiu’s GReAT team enable us
to do very precise evaluations in terms of quality
and quantity.

In January 2019, ATT&CK included

Conducting the Attack

The Attack Phases

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

ATT&CK considers tactics to be the different stages of
an attack that a threat actor works through to achieve
his strategic goal. In this context, we also speak of
tactical goals. ATT&CK defines the following tactics:

Initial Access

The initial access phase is the starting point for all the subsequent phases of an attack. It includes
the initial contact with the attack target and compromising the so-called “patient zero.”

Persistence

Persistence points within the target network ensure ongoing access to the compromised network. The more important the target is to the adversary, the more effort is put into persistence
points for long-time access to the network.

Privilege
Escalation

The escalation of privileges is often needed to install malware or persistence points. Increased
privileges are sometimes also required to be able to spread to other systems or gain access to the
strategic goals (e.g. data).

Discovery

Exploration within the target network is required to locate systems, users and data relevant
to the mission.

Lateral
Movement

Collection

22 – 23

Exfiltration

This refers to moving across a network to the relevant data for the mission. This is often
accompanied by the execution phase and the installation of further persistence points.

The relevant data is collected.

This is the final phase required to successfully complete the mission and involves
exfiltrating the relevant data.

The following phases run in parallel to these phases,
depending on the successful achievement of the
objectives of the respective phases:

The execution of malicious code on a local or remote system primarily takes place in the initial
access and lateral movement phases. The next phase cannot be reached without execution
of code controlled by the attacker. Execution is thus one of the most important prerequisites for
the further development of the attack and for spreading across the target network.

Execution

Bypassing defense and detection mechanisms, e.g. by turning off the firewall at the endpoint or
deleting log data, is one of the tactical goals that threat actors use in every other phase of their
mission to either conceal their presence or bypass detection mechanisms.

Defense Evasion

Valid credentials play a key role for attackers. Firstly, it enables access to systems with legitimate
credentials and lateral movement within the target network. Secondly, it grants access to the
data that the attackers want. Furthermore, reusing credentials enables attackers to conduct an
attack using few resources because no exploits have to be written, acquired or employed in any
other way.

Credential Access

The command & control channel is the attacker’s means of communication to keep the
compromised target infrastructure under his control. If the attacker loses this channel, the attack
is literally stopped. As such attackers often establish multiple command & control channels to
ensure access.

Control

Threat Actors’ Techniques
In order to reach or complete a specific phase, the threat
actors in the ATT&CK framework11 use a wide variety
of techniques. Each phase can contain several techniques

and each technique can be used within more than one phase.
ATT&CK contains 224 of these techniques, which are found
in the various phases as follows:

The bar chart provides important insight into the modus
operandi of threat actors and clearly shows the phases in
which they posses the most capabilities. Looking at the
phases in terms of the number of techniques present,
the analysis shows that threat actors have access to a
very broad range of approaches for outsmarting defense
mechanisms in the different phases of the attack
through defense evasion, and just as many approaches
available to guarantee them long-term access in the
persistence phase.

What are the most significant changes
in APT activity that you are observing
and what areas are primarily affected by
these changes?
We observe more and more APT groups
engaging in fileless attacks.

Most-used techniques by threat actor
An evaluation of the APT groups and their techniques
shows a clear trend towards file-less attacks. This was
also confirmed by Costin Raiu.

This makes it more difficult to detect
infections, as no malicious files can be
found in the system.

The following illustration shows the ten most
frequently used techniques across the 80 threat actors
within ATT&CK:

Conducting the Attack

The top ten approaches can be summarised under two themes: “Living off the land” and “Proven methods still work”.

Living off the land

More and more APT groups are relying on scripting languages that are now integrated as
standard in Windows operating systems, such as PowerShell and command-line interfaces,
to execute their malicious code without being detected by application whitelisting solutions
or leaving significant traces on the system.
Registry run keys and entries in the Windows start-up folder remain the most popular
persistence mechanism technique among threat actors.

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Proven methods
still work

Not all threat actors have the resources to develop zero-day exploits. Most of them continue
to rely on spear phishing attachments and user execution to dupe users into executing
malicious code.
APT threat actors use simple ways to achieve their goals. Through Credential Dumping
adversaries obtain valid credentials and use them to move laterally inside of the target
network and ensure long-term access.
To disguise their code, attackers still rely on Encodings and Encryptions and do use common
protocols like HTTP or DNS to blend into normal traffic where the majority is using remote
file copy methods to transfer their malicious software.

Threat Actors’ Software

26 – 27

Software implements techniques required by threat actors to successfully run through a specific tactic. For this,
they use a wide variety of software categories that represent either a tool, utility or malware within ATT&CK.12

What are the most significant
changes in APT activity that you
are observing and what areas
are primarily affected by these
changes?

Most-used software by threat actor type
An analysis of the APT groups and the software they
use shows that off-the-shelf tools and software already
provided by the operating system are used most
frequently. This observation matches Costin Raiu’s
experience.

We are seeing more and more
groups adopting public tools such
as Empire Powershell, Metasploit,
Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, making

Countermeasures and

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Countermeasures against targeted attacks build on
standard protection based on preventive measures such
as applying current patches, implementing two-factor
authentication, connection to the internet only through
a proxy etc. These measures are sometimes sufficient to
redirect the interest of non-state threat actors towards
other targets.
In the previous sections, we looked at the basic aspects
of threat actors, which are reflected in their intent
(strategic goals), opportunity (attack surface) and capa­
bility (techniques). These aspects must be taken into
account when developing appropriate, effective counter­
measures. Probably the most effective defence would
be to eliminate the strategic goal (intent). Governments
or companies that do not store data are not targeted by
governmental threat actors who are engaging in espionage and want to benefit from stolen data. However,
this defence can only be employed rarely. If we look at
the available attack surface, it has increased rather than
decreased in size in recent years. Increasing digitalisation,
the storage of data in the cloud and everything-connected, always-on or IoT Devices are presenting an exorbitantly large attack surface for companies, society and
individuals.

We must therefore base our countermeasures on threat
actors’ capabilities and techniques, which often ends
in a head-to-head race and, given the many approaches
available, this appears extremely complex at first glance.
However, on closer inspection, it’s clear that most
techniques and the employed software can be identified
using detection methods that track system activity.

The Detection Methods with
the most Coverage

What are typical mistakes
organisations do in order to be
prepared for an APT attack and
how they respond to an APT?
Most organisations focus on
preventing an external attacker from
getting access to internal resources,
but few take measures to detect
an attacker once he/she has access
to the internal network.

Our analysis shows that a majority of the procedures of
threat actors can be detected by monitoring process
and file operations. These detection methods are the
most effective ones, to detect the attack patterns used
within targeted attacks. This, too, tallies with what
Costin Raiu said.
The following illustration of the top ten detection
methods underlines this once again:

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Detection methods for process activities identify the majority of the existing procedures of threat actors.
User and network activity provide further context.

System activity

The execution of code controlled by threat actors is a prerequisite for achieving their
strategic goals. Monitoring processes, files and changes in the Windows registry is the
most effective detection method for tracing a threat actor’s intrusion pattern. Even though
this form of detection brings the greatest added value, very high data volumes and
efforts for tuning are to be expected. Processes, network connections, file and registry
operations must be fully understood.

User and network
activity

In addition to monitoring system activity, network data and user authentication logs
provide additional insight into the adversaries intrusion pattern.

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Targeted attacks are becoming increasingly likely and
the currently available technological measures are often
insufficient for keeping pace with the abilities of professional cyber threat actors. For these reasons, Swisscom
relies on a risk-based security model that requires a high
level of security awareness within the organisation by
employee training and involves the community in the security culture, e.g. through the Bug Bounty Programme13,
and fundamental preventive security measures e.g.
whitelisting and the patching of applications and
restricting of network traffic and e-mail attachments.
Prevention is one important aspect, however this might
ultimately fail when faced by highly motivated threat actors. It is therefore necessary to be proactive, understand
threat actors’ tactics, techniques and procedures and incorporate any gained insight into the detection process.
We recommend simulating a targeted attack through
red teaming exercises, conducting threat hunting and
engage in sharing groups.

Red teaming
Because attackers are always one step ahead, we
have become attackers ourselves. In 2015, Swisscom
decided to break new ground by becoming the first
Swiss company to establish an official red team. The red
team consists of a small group of Swisscom employees
who carry out realistic attacks against Swisscom infrastructure and services. These are so called ethical
hackers, i.e. hackers with good intentions who conduct
targeted attacks against Swisscom, though NOT
against client applications or client data.
What are their goals?
• To identify vulnerabilities and their impact before
others do;
• To test the blue team and thus help the company
develop countermeasures and improve processes;
• To learn from incidents at other companies and test
whether they could occur also at Swisscom.

Threat hunting
Threat hunting aims to detect previously undetected
threats. It is not a replacement for a functioning Security
Operations Center (SOC), but uses partly automated,
and even manual methods for detecting attack behaviour and patterns that could not be detected by
existing security mechanisms. This approach supplies
new detection methods, for example. Swisscom CSIRT
regularly conducts threat-hunting sessions to identify
threats within the Swisscom network. As part of this,
the ATT&CK Framework often serves as a reference to
understand the tactics and techniques of the different
threat actors. In this context, CSIRT regularly publishes
new detection methods for SIGMA14 and YARA15 and
makes them accessible to the community. SIGMA is a
generic and open signature format with which relevant
detection log data can be described once and which can
be used for a variety of SIEM and log systems. SIGMA
is one of the few tools that can describe attacks with
ATT&CK tactics and techniques and makes detection directly useful for others. YARA enables you to create your
own signatures and detection methods that can then be
used for both files and memory scans. Swisscom CSIRT
regularly creates YARA rules for attacker toolsets and
shares these with public communities such as Florian
Roth’s16 signature base and other closed communities.

As mentioned in the previous sections, we must accept
that attacks are carried out by people and not by
systems. Thererfore also people are needed to react to
them. Swisscom operates multiple Security Operations
Center (SOC) to be able to investigate possible activity by attackers in a systematic way. Swisscom CSIRT
analysts become active as soon as activity is detected
which points to more targeted attacks on Swisscom’s IT
infrastructure.

Sharing groups and
communities
In addition to sharing detected attacks based on SIGMA
and YARA, Swisscom CSIRT and its staff are active members of many trust groups for operational cooperation
in the daily work of CSIRTs, SOCs and threat intelligence
teams. These trust groups are designed to bring together
people with similar problems in their everyday work
and to simplify the exchange between them. Swisscom
regularly provides these sharing groups and communities with information on current observations, risks and
indicators of malware and attacks.
Comprehensive corporate protection thanks to
early detection of and professional intervention in
cybersecurity attacks – available as a service
Today, vast volumes of corporate and personal infor­
mation are available on various data sources (networks,
applications, end devices, social media, the cloud, darknet, etc.). As networking and digitalisation continue
to grow, so has the complexity of the threats. Timely
detection of security-related incidents is essential.
Professional threat detection & response requires
specific processes, tools, many years’ experience and
highly specialised employees. It is therefore almost
impossible for individual companies to understand the
constantly changing cybersecurity attacks and react
accordingly. Support is thus required from experienced
partners. Swisscom has been successfully protecting its
network infrastructure, customer and product data as
well as itself against cyber threats for years. It uses this

experience to minimise cyber risks in collaboration with
its customers. Good data visualisation facilitates the
early detection of potential security incidents. Timely
analysis and appropriate reaction to a security incident
improves the security level and the use of resources
within the company.
Our Threat Detection & Response service enables corporate customers to choose between four service variants
depending on how much cybersecurity support they
would like from Swisscom. Here is a short overview:

Swisscom Cyber Security Report 2019

Security Analytics as a Service: A dashboard provides
the customer with an overview of potential security
incidents from defined log data of the company.
Security Operation Center (SOC) as a Service: In addition
to security analytics, customers receive analyses and
concrete recommendations for action as well as direct
access to specialists at Swisscom’s SOC. We have been
providing SOC services to Swiss companies both at home
and abroad for more than ten years. Our SOC analysts
can interpret security events and incidents competently
and quickly.
Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) as
a Service: Swisscom experts can be called on to analyse
and tackle critical security incidents and lead the security
incident management process. These experienced
experts help customers preserve evidence and communicate with their customers and partners.

Conclusion
In most cases, targeted attacks – especially those by
APTs with strategic governmental goals – cannot be
prevented. The increasingly digitised world is attracting
more and more threat actors into cyberspace. We must
therefore accept the growing likelihood that we will
become a target of interest or at least a target of opportunity at some point in time. Threat actors have a variety
of approaches at their disposal in the different phases
of an attack, for which they are increasingly employing
off-the-shelf tools and living-off-the-land methods.
Although APTs belong to the top tier of cyber threat
actors, they do not develop zero-day exploits for
every operation. Rather, they use tried and tested
methods in which people remain an attractive target
in order to bypass security mechanisms and activate
malicious code.
It is often claimed that attackers only need to succeed
once to get into a system. Our analysis shows that we
can make the opposite argument; namely that if we
develop our detection measures in such a way that the
approaches of threat actors can be detected, they
need make only one mistake in order to be recognised.
Focussing on detecting execution – the execution phase
– is a promising approach here. However, with APTs in
particular, the complete intrusion pattern should be
understood before the attack is stopped.
