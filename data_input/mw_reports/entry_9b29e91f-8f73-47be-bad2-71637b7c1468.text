Malicious NetTraveler Toolkit Infects 350 High-Profile Victims for Data Theft and
Surveillance
Today Kaspersky Lab’s team of experts published a new research report about NetTraveler,
which is a family of malicious programs used by APT actors to successfully compromise
more than 350 high-profile victims in 40 countries. The NetTraveler group has infected
victims across multiple establishments in both the public and private sector including
government institutions, embassies, the oil and gas industry, research centers, military
contractors and activists.
According to Kaspersky Lab’s report, this threat actor has been active since as early as
2004; however, the highest volume of activity occurred from 2010 – 2013. Most recently, the
NetTraveler group’s main domains of interest for cyberespionage activities include space
exploration, nanotechnology, energy production, nuclear power, lasers, medicine and
communications.

Infection Methods:
Attackers infected victims by sending clever spear-phishing emails with malicious
Microsoft Office attachments that are rigged with two highly exploited vulnerabilities
(CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2010-3333). Even though Microsoft already issued patches
for these vulnerabilities they’re still widely used for exploitation in targeted attacks and
have proven to be effective.
The titles of the malicious attachments in the spear-phishing emails depict the
NetTraveler group’s dogged effort of customizing their attacks in order to infect highprofile target. Notable titles of malicious documents include:
Army Cyber Security Policy 2013.doc
Report - Asia Defense Spending Boom.doc

His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s visit to Switzerland day 4
Freedom of Speech.doc

Data Theft & Exfiltration:
During Kaspersky Lab’s analysis, its team of experts obtained infection logs from
several of NetTraveler’s command and control servers (C&C). C&C servers are used to
install additional malware on infected machines and exfiltrate stolen data. Kaspersky
Lab’s experts calculated the amount of stolen data stored on NetTraveler’s C&C
servers to be more than 22 gigabytes.
Exfiltrated data from infected machines typically included file system listings, keyloggs,
and various types of files including PDFs, excel sheets, word documents and files. In
addition, the NetTraveler toolkit was able to install additional info-stealing malware as a
backdoor, and it could be customized to steal other types of sensitive information such
as configuration details for an application or computer-aided design files.

Global Infection Statistics:
Based on Kaspersky Lab’s analysis of NetTraveler’s C&C data, there were a total of
350 victims in 40 countries across including the United States, Canada, United
Kingdom, Russia, Chile, Morocco, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Ukraine, Lithuania,
Belarus, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Mongolia, Iran, Turkey, India, Pakistan,
South Korea, Thailand, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and Jordan.
In conjunction with the C&C data analysis, Kaspersky Lab’s experts used the
Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) to identify additional infection statistics. The top ten
countries with victims detected by KSN were Mongolia followed by Russia, India,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Tajikistan, South Korea, Spain and Germany.

Additional Findings
During Kaspersky Lab’s analysis of NetTraveler, the company’s experts identified six
victims that had been infected by both NetTraveler and Red October, which was
another cyberespionage operation analyzed by Kaspersky Lab in January 2013.
Although no direct links between the NetTraveler attackers and the Red October threat
actors were observed, the fact that specific victims were infected by both of these
campaigns indicates that these high-profile victims are being targeted by multiple threat
actors because their information is a valuable commodity to the attackers.

Kaspersky Lab’s products detect and neutralize the malicious programs and its variants used
by the NetTraveler Toolkit, including Trojan-Spy.Win32.TravNet and
Downloader.Win32.NetTraveler. Kaspersky Lab’s products detect the Microsoft Office
exploits used in the spear-phishing attacks, including Exploit.MSWord.CVE-2010-333,
Exploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158.
