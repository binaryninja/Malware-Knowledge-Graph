１．A41APT Campaign Overview

A41APT Campaign Overview
 Period of Activity: March 2019 to January 2021 Present
 Target: Japan (Japanese companies including overseas branches)
 Initial Vector: Not Spear phishing But SSL-VPN abuse
 Malwares: New type of malwares using dll-sideloading

（SodaMaster/P8RAT/DESLoader/FYAntiLoader etc.）
 Public Info: Very few [1][2][3][4]
 Characteristics: Very tough to detect attacker’s intrusion
We call this threat actor A41APT from the hostname
feature 「DESKTOP-A41UVJV」 that is continuously used
during the initial intrusion in this campaign.

2-1．DESLoader
Aka. SigLoader
▪ Loader file for DLL Side-Loading
and files contain encrypted
shellcode and payload.

▪ Decrypt multiple PEs and
shellcodes sequentially in multiple
stages.
▪ Multiple algorithms are used for
decryption.
▪ Finally, the payload is executed in
memory.

DESLoader TimeLine
▪ AES and DES algorithms
are implemented using
proprietary coding

▪ In many cases, not all
ciphers are used
▪ The order in which
ciphers are used is
changed
▪ DESLoader which
implements only one
cipher contains a lot

３．Characteristics of Intrusion

A41APT’s intrusion method
Initial Intrusion

Penetration via SSL-VPN
using vulnerabilities or
stolen credentials

Internal Recon.
Lateral Movement

Persistence of
malware

C2
Communication

Trace Removal

Perform a port scan to
search for open RDP or
SMB port. Then, connect to
RDP with an administrator
account.

Persistence by scheduled
task registration to execute
the legitimate PE

Communicate with C2 server
via DESLoader’s payload or
PowerShell remoting

Delete the event log after
communication with C2 is
finished.

24

Characteristics of Compromise
1. Initial intrusion using SSL-VPN products
2. Network scanning and credential theft
3. PowerShell remoting to remove event logs
4. Persistence of malware by scheduled task

25

３-１． Initial intrusion via SSL-VPN (Exp. session hijacking)
•

In October 2019, an attacker used the hostname DESKTOP-A41UVJV to hijack
sessions to enter the internal network via SSL-VPN product, Pulse Secure.

•

JPCERT also reported a similar attack targeting SSL-VPN [4].

•

In some cases, attackers used credentials that they had stolen in the past intrusion.

26

３-2． Network scanning and credential theft
Network scanning and RDP

Credential theft

▪ Run csvde.exe, a CSV export command
▪ After the intrusion by SSL-VPN, perform
line tool provided by Microsoft.
internal network scanning to find open
port RDP (3389/TCP) and SMB (445/TCP). ▪ Execute AdFind provided by joeware.
▪ Use an administrator account to deploy
▪ Dump of SYSTEM/SECURITY/SAM hive,
RDP to servers with free RDP.
etc.
Exp. server types that are frequently
compromised by RDP
AD server
File server
Anti Virus management server
Backup server
Print server
FAX server

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/itpro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732101(v=ws.11)

27

３-3． PowerShell remoting to delete event logs
•

Event log: the end of a PowerShell
remoting session

•

Windows PowerShell.evtx
EID: 403

•

The "C2 address" and the "*.nls file
name" are changed, but the rest is
the same
⇒ probably common tools execution

28

３-４．Persistence of malware by scheduled task
▪ Registered a task scheduler that executes a legitimate executable file that loads
DESLoader every 15 minutes.
▪ It is unlikely that the same scheduled task name is created on the compromised hosts.

４．Threat Actor’s Infrastructure

Threat Actor’s Infrastructure
1. The hostname used for the intrusion via SSL-VPN
2. Characteristics of the C2 infrastructure

32

Hostname used for the initial intrusion via SSL-VPN
▪ Tendency to use distinctive hostnames and attempt intrusions
while changing IP addresses
✓ Host names used in breaches observed in the past
DESKTOP-A41UVJV
dellemc_N1548P

▪ Tendency to use an IP for intrusion that is different from the C2 server’s IP

33

Characteristics of the C2 infrastructure
▪ For C2, there is a tendency to use IP addresses and not to use domains.
▪ From the observed C2 IP addresses, there is little bias toward country and AS, and
we observed that there is a tendency not to reuse IP addresses repeatedly.

34

５．Consideration of Threat Actor’s Attribution

Considerations for attribution of A41APT
1. Relevance to APT10
2. Relevance to BlackTech

36

１．Relevance to APT10
Common TTPs

▪ APT10 involvement in targeted attack campaign
against Turkey mentioned [5].
▪ Confirmed the existence of an early version of
SodaMaster (x86) in March 2019.

ShellCode

- Multilayers loading
- CPPHostDLR loader
- F**jYouAnti export
- Look for payloads under
“C:¥Windows¥Microsoft.Net”

load

▪ xRAT observed in A41APT campaign has
common TTPs with BlackBerry Cylance reports
in 2019 was confirmed [6].

Common TTPs

SodaMaster

xRAT/QuasarRAT

connect

MenuPass/QuasarRAT
Backdoor Report

Run dll payload
Run Shellcode payload

*Compared to SodaMaster in 2020, only two commands are supported.

37

２．Relevance to BlackTech
SodaMaster

TSCookie

▪ Identified common features
between SodaMaster and
TSCookie [7].
▪ The same information is collected
from the compromised host in the
initial stage
– Username
– Computer name
– Current process ID
▪ Observed existence of two
malware, SodaMaster and
TSCookie, on multiple
compromised hosts
38

６．Summary

Wrap up：A41APT Campaign
ADVERSARY（A41APT）

▪ Intrusion via SSL-VPN
▪ Heavy usage of RDP for lateral
movement (mainly servers)

▪ Strong association with APT10

▪ Abusing DLL-Sideloading

▪ Relevance to BlackTech

▪ Remove traces

INFRASTRUCTURE

CAPABILITIES
▪ Targeting Japanese companies
including overseas branches

▪ Heavy usage of IP addresses for C2
(no domain usage)

▪ Wide range of industries such as
manufacturing

▪ Less reuse of IP addresses for C2

VICTIMS

▪ IP for an initial intrusion and C2 IP
40
are different.

Wrap up： Features of this campaign
✓ Targeting the kryptonite of EDR/FSA detection
• Malware is written on the disk by the attacker's manual operation via SSL-VPN instead of
malware-originated intrusion from Spear phishing email (legitimate file, loader, encrypted file)
• Intrusion from group affiliates, including overseas companies

• Malware is mostly placed on servers, and the number of compromised servers are very small.
• Most of the malware detected in the same period have different C2 addresses, so there is little

tendency to use the same samples.

✓ After the intrusion, some rough operations were seen.
• Heavy usage of network discovery using RDP

• Common traces deletion method of event logs
• Recorded attacker's hostname in event log

At the end...
 A41APT campaign is very stealthy and difficult to detect, but it is not undetectable.
 The compromised target has shifted from endpoint to server, and the intrusion

route has also shifted from spear phishing to abusing SSL-VPN. Security measures
need to be reviewed in your organization to respond to change in attack method.

 By refining daily security operations and thoroughly reviewing the security holes in
each organization's environment, it may be possible to detect and protect attacks

from even small anomalies.
