National Security

Enter the Cyber-dragon
Hackers have attacked America’s defense establishment, as well as companies from Google to Morgan
Stanley to security giant RSA, and fingers point to China as the culprit. The author gets an exclusive look
at the raging cyber-war—Operation Aurora! Operation Shady rat!—and learns why Washington has
been slow to fight back.

Lying there in the junk-mail folder, in the spammy mess of mortgage offers and erectiledysfunction drug ads, an e-mail from an associate with a subject line that looked legitimate
caught the man’s eye. The subject line said “2011 Recruitment Plan.” It was late winter of 2011.
The man clicked on the message, downloaded the attached Excel spreadsheet file, and
unwittingly set in motion a chain of events allowing hackers to raid the computer networks of
his employer, RSA. RSA is the security division of the high-tech company EMC. Its products
protect computer networks at the White House, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National
Security Agency, the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, most top defense
contractors, and a majority of Fortune 500 corporations.
The parent company disclosed the breach on March 17 in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The hack gravely undermined the reputation of RSA’s popular SecurID
security service. As spring gave way to summer, bloggers and computer-security experts found
evidence that the attack on RSA had come from China. They also linked the RSA attack to the
penetration of computer networks at some of RSA’s most powerful defense-contractor
clients—among them, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and L-3 Communications. Few
details of these episodes have been made public.
The RSA and defense-contractor hacks are among the latest battles in a
decade-long spy war. Hackers from many countries have been
exfiltrating—that is, stealing—intellectual property from American
corporations and the U.S. government on a massive scale, and Chinese
hackers are among the main culprits. Because virtual attacks can be
routed through computer servers anywhere in the world, it is almost
impossible to attribute any hack with total certainty.

“The difference with
cyber is there are
people trying to fly
planes into buildings
every day now.
And everybody just
looks the other way.”

Dozens of nations have highly developed industrial cyber-espionage
programs, including American allies such as France and Israel. And because the People’s
Republic of China is such a massive entity, it is impossible to know how much Chinese hacking is
done on explicit orders from the government. In some cases, the evidence suggests that
government and military groups are executing the attacks themselves. In others, Chinese
authorities are merely turning a blind eye to illegal activities that are good for China’s economy
and bad for America’s. Last year Google became the first major company to blow the whistle on
Chinese hacking when it admitted to a penetration known as Operation Aurora, which also hit
Page 1 of 14

Intel, Morgan Stanley, and several dozen other corporations. (The attack was given that name
because the word “aurora” appears in the malware that victims downloaded.) Earlier this year,
details concerning the most sweeping intrusion since Operation Aurora were discovered by the
cyber-security firm McAfee. Dubbed “Operation Shady rat,” the attacks (of which more later)
are being reported here for the first time. Most companies have

which an intelligence agency secretly provides information to a
group of private-sector hackers so that truths too sensitive for the
government to tell will nevertheless come out.
This unusual project began in March, when National Security Agency officials asked a private
defense contractor to organize a cadre of elite non-government experts to study the RSA cyberattacks. The experts constituted a SEAL Team Six of cyber-security and referred to their work as
Operation Starlight. “This is the N.S.A. outsourcing the finger-pointing to the private sector,”
says one person who was invited to join the group and has been privy to its e-mail logs. The
N.S.A. provided Operation Starlight with the data it needed for its forensic analysis.
Operation Starlight’s secret “Working Draft Version 0.2” report, dated April 4, 2011, has a cover
page that bears a galactic image resembling a meteor-pockmarked moon. The source who
provided Vanity Fair with the document emphasized that the draft is just that—a draft—and
said that Starlight’s provisional conclusions are subject to change. (The source also says that
Operation Starlight’s analysis will continue for a matter of months, and possibly as long as a
year.) As of April, however, the draft report argued that the RSA hacks represent an “organized,
concerted campaign on behalf of China.” It also suggested that RSA had been under attack,
perhaps by different groups, for months prior to the attack that the company acknowledged in
March. In July, in the lengthiest interview RSA officials have given since their troubles began,
executive chairman Art Coviello and EMC chief security officer Dave Martin resisted those
suggestions. Coviello admitted that the SecurID hack was preceded in March by “pretty heavyduty reconnaissance.” He refused to say specifically when the attack began or ended, but
described the duration as “a matter of days, not weeks.” He agreed that the evidence
Page 2 of 14

suggested that the SecurID attack had come from a nation-state, but declined to accuse a
specific country.

“The Adversary”
If you were designing a new jetfighter for Lockheed Martin, sooner or later you would have to
travel to an air-force base to talk to military personnel about what they want the new jetfighter
to do. Meetings over, you’d go back to your hotel room, fire up your laptop, and log on to
Lockheed’s remote network to get some work done. In order to log on, you’d have to glance
down at an inch-long red-white-blue-and-gray plastic key-chain fob, shaped vaguely like a key,
on which a little L.E.D. screen displays strings of six to eight digits that change every minute or
so. Adding those numbers to the basic password that you’d memorized, you would type the
whole hybrid string of characters into the Lockheed-network log-in box—and then you would
be in. That key fob, called a SecurID token, is RSA’s best-known product. The strings of numbers
on its screen are generated by a microchip using the SecurID algorithm and a unique
cryptographic seed.
Each numeric string is called a “one-time password,” and, when entered in combination with
your own chosen password, it bumps up your network’s security by means of “two-factor
authentication.” As of March 2011, RSA commanded 70 percent of the market for this form of
security. More than 25 million of these tokens are in circulation, and for years they have been
used by most U.S. intelligence and military officers, defense contractors, White House officials,
and Fortune 500 executives.
So it was of great concern to many of the

posted an open letter to customers on
RSA’s Web site, announcing that the company’s security system had identified “an extremely
sophisticated cyber attack in progress,” an attack that “resulted in certain information being
exported from RSA’s systems,” some of which was “specifically related to RSA’s SecurID twofactor authentication products.”
The letter was so vague and judiciously bland that many readers assumed what the later
Lockheed hack seemed to suggest: that SecurID’s seed-key algorithm and some, if not all, of its
seed-key database may have been stolen. RSA executives have consistently refused to say
precisely what the company lost. Coviello did say in an interview that “the information taken, in
and of itself, would not allow a direct attack.” An attacker, he went on, “would have had to get
other information that only the customer had in their possession.” To weaponize the stolen
SecurID information would require a strategy of coordinated intrusions, involving attacks not
just on RSA but also preliminary attacks on every other target company—something that
seemed so complicated as to be almost impossible. Yet within two months, the impossible had
Page 3 of 14

come to pass. Attackers, whom security experts often refer to in the satanic singular as “the
Adversary,” had broken into Lockheed Martin’s network using SecurID information stolen from
RSA.
On April 1, the RSA Web site published a blog posting titled “Anatomy of an Attack” by the
company’s head of new technologies, Uri Rivner. Chatty and anecdotal, it described the “2011
Recruitment Plan” e-mail, one of two e-mails sent to low-level employees. (“You wouldn’t
consider these users particularly high profile or high value targets,” Rivner wrote.) The post said
nothing about when the attack began, how long it lasted, or what was taken, but some of
Rivner’s language seems intended to suggest that the intrusion was short-lived: “Since RSA
detected this attack in progress, it is likely the attacker had to move very quickly to accomplish
anything.” Rivner wrote that the RSA hackers used a Flash zero-day vulnerability—that is, a flaw
in the code that is unknown to the program’s developers and has not been used in prior
attacks—to install an extremely common downloader called Poison Ivy. But he gave no details
about the malware that Poison Ivy downloaded into RSA’s system.
Rivner characterized the attackers’ technique as a form of “Advanced Persistent Threat,” or
A.P.T.—security lingo for “Pretty sure it came from China,” in the words of Brian Krebs, a
leading cyber-security blogger. According to Operation Starlight’s draft report, some of the
malware that was used to attack RSA was “compiled,” or written, in December of 2010—a full
three months before the SecurID hack. “APT attack groups typically launch their attacks within
hours of compilation, providing a useful date indicator for the targeted intrusion,” the draft
says. The draft acknowledges that “these compile dates are easily modified,” but it goes on:
“The earliest compile date [of malware used in the RSA hack] that
has not been materially modified is 12/22/2010, potentially

intrusions beginning earlier than March.
The SecurID hack, whenever it began and however long it lasted, was a sophisticated intrusion.
Though RSA has not said how the Adversary managed to stay undetected inside its network,
previous examples of stealth techniques used by A.P.T. attackers illustrate how resourceful they
can be. Jonathan Pollet, the head of Red Tiger Security, based in Houston, Texas, was hired in
2010 by three Fortune 100 companies to clean up after a spate of cyber attacks that came from
servers in China. (These intrusions were similar in many ways to the attacks known as Night
Dragon, which targeted various energy industries at about the same time.) Pollet says the

victims knew that something strange was going on because they kept getting locked out of their
e-mail accounts for no apparent reason. But the Adversary stayed under the radar by making an
ingeniously malevolent move: taking control of the companies’ virtual I.T. help desks,
impersonating their I.T. help-desk staff, and answering employees’ service complaints
themselves. “Attackers want to be a parasite, want to make sure the host is happy,” says Pollet.
“So if they know the help desk is going to get overwhelmed with complaints, they decide, ‘Let’s
just solve these problems ourselves.’ ”

Body Count
China’s aggressive campaign of cyber-espionage began about a decade ago, with attacks on U.S.
government agencies. (The details have still not been divulged.) Then China broadened the
scope of its efforts, infiltrating the civilian sector

research at McAfee, who gave Aurora and Night
Dragon their names and has written definitive
studies of A.P.T. attacks, says that “today we see pretty much any company that has valuable
intellectual property or trade secrets of any kind being pilfered continually, all day long, every
day, relentlessly.”
Some of China’s intellectual-property thefts are like virtual cat burglaries; others are inside jobs;
and many combine elements of both. Dongfan “Greg” Chung, a former Boeing and Rockwell
engineer, was convicted in 2009 of acting as an agent of the P.R.C. in stealing secrets related to
the Space Shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket. In March of this year, a man named Sixing
“Steve” Liu, a Chinese engineer who worked for a division of L-3 Communications, was arrested
on charges of illegally exporting military data to China. (Liu has pleaded not guilty and the case
is pending.) A former Google executive told me, “The party is very aggressive in enforcing
loyalty among Chinese employees of American companies. This creates a dilemma of divided
loyalties. Google’s response was to take the risk and plow ahead. Google did not hire private
investigators. There may have been a cost for that.” Early news coverage of Operation Aurora,
against Google, indicated that some Google China employees had been denied access to
internal networks and others had been put on leave or reassigned in the wake of the attacks.
According to a Google spokesperson, the company “ran some tests … internally to ensure that
the network was safe and secure and we gave Googlers in China a holiday on the Tuesday we
made the announcement.”
The vulnerability of corporations to attack stems in part from ignorance, in part from denial.
Google executives reportedly believed that the American government monitors this country’s
Internet infrastructure the same way it monitors foreign military threats to keep the geographic
homeland secure. A former White House official told me, “After Google got hacked, they called
the N.S.A. in and said, ‘You were supposed to protect us from this!’ The N.S.A. guys just about
Page 5 of 14

fell out of their chairs. They could not believe how naïve the Google guys had been.” (In
response to detailed questions regarding Operation Aurora and the company’s response to it,
Google declined to comment.)
Martin Libicki, a Rand Corporation analyst and the author of Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar,
says that the 2007 hack of Defense Secretary Robert Gates’s computer finally made some in
Washington take the cyber-espionage problem seriously. The Pentagon has admitted that in
June of that year it had to shut down part of the computer system in Gates’s office after the
attack, which senior U.S. officials attributed to the People’s Liberation Army. “It got personal at
that point,” Libicki says. Other Western nations started talking publicly about the problem at
around the same time. In August of that same year, German chancellor Angela Merkel
reportedly confronted Chinese premier Wen Jiabao after hackers from his country gained
access to the computers in her office, as well as those in the German foreign, economic, and
research ministries. In December, M.I.5 sent a letter to 300 British C.E.O.’s and security chiefs
warning them that state-sponsored Chinese organizations may have been spying on their
computer systems.
Public awareness of cyber-espionage was dramatically heightened in January 2010 when
Google started talking about Operation Aurora. Operation Aurora gathered source code, the
virtual equivalent of Coca-Cola’s secret formula, from a broad array of U.S. corporations.
Because source code is so valuable, and because the manner of its theft was so innovative,
many experts were puzzled by the way that Google announced the attacks, emphasizing
Aurora’s secondary goal (reconnaissance of “human-rights activists” in China) rather than its
primary one (stealing Google’s virtual DNA).
Access to source code makes it relatively easy to discover new vulnerabilities in a Web
application. For malware writers, these vulnerabilities are the keys to the kingdom, the open
windows in the house that let them get inside to steal the furniture—or, depending on their
goals, to move the furniture around, by altering the code and therefore potentially changing
the functions of the company’s product.
It was eventually revealed that intruders had made off with source code for a Google passwordmanagement program called Gaia. The company’s

than Google publicly told.
Three people who visited Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters while the attacks
were in progress describe dramatic scenes of a company under siege. Google “built a physically
separate area for the security team,” one of them says. Sergey Brin, one of the company’s coPage 6 of 14

founders, was deeply involved in the cyber-defense. “He moved his desk to go sit with the
Aurora responders every day. Because he grew up in the Soviet Union, he personally has a real
hard-on for the Chinese now. He is pissed.” Caught unawares and shorthanded, the company
made a list of the world’s top security professionals, and Brin personally called to offer them
jobs—with $100,000 signing bonuses for some, according to one person who received such an
offer—and quickly built Google’s small, pre-Aurora security operation into a group of more than
200.
Meanwhile, representatives of other companies hit by Aurora were invited to the Googleplex
for private meetings with Adkins. She told two of the visitors that the attackers had made a
beeline for Google’s “legal-discovery portals,” the system the company uses to evaluate
requests for information from law-enforcement agencies and foreign governments. “The
activity on those portals is closely monitored,” one visitor says. “Someone noticed that a bunch
of Chinese names were queried on one woman’s computer [in the legal-discovery department]
and asked her, ‘Why did you query all these people?’ She said, ‘I didn’t.’ ”
Security took her laptop to analyze it, and “that was the string they started pulling” that
unraveled the Aurora attack.
Much more significant, however—and previously unreported—is that the intruders used
Google’s internal search engine to look for words related to the company’s signing certificates:
virtual credentials that verify the identity of the source of any software before it can be
downloaded to a computer. This part of the attack was foiled
because Google keeps its signing certificates offline, in an “airgapped” network—a network that is not connected to the Internet.

Yahoo and Symantec as among the other victims. As the year wore
on, the body count grew: Adobe, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace
admitted that they’d been attacked, then Intel. Before long a cache
of e-mails written by analysts at the security firm HBGary and its sister company HBGary
Federal were made public, after the companies were caught in the crosshairs of the hacktivist
group Anonymous, a loose coalition of individuals who perform coordinated cyber-attacks,

Aurora or similar attacks had also hit Baker Hughes, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Conoco

DuPont. DuPont was hit so intensely that, one HBGary analyst wrote, “their hair is on fire.”

had been going on for much longer
than the public knew. “Many of the leading defense contractors … all had … aurora-type attacks
as far back as 2005,” one analyst wrote. “So a search engine makes a big media stink about one
intrusion, and that leads to a bunch of hype? I think the discussion needs to be on why it’s
taken 5+ years for the rest of the industry to catch on.”

Pointing Fingers
From the start, Google openly asserted its view that the attack originated in China, and Hillary
Clinton, after being “briefed by Google on these allegations,” issued a statement that pointedly
said, “We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.” A report by Verisign iDefense, a
security-intelligence service based in Dulles, Virginia, went further, stating that Aurora was
directed by “agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof.” The Chinese government made no
official, public response to Clinton’s statement. But shortly thereafter, a spokesman for China’s
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology told Xinhua, the official news agency, about
the allegations regarding Google, that the “accusation that the Chinese government
participated in [any] cyber attack, either in an explicit or inexplicit way, is groundless and aims
to denigrate China.”
Yet, in the case of Aurora, there is evidence of involvement. After researchers found similarities
between the tools used in the Aurora attacks and malware tools that were posted on open
Chinese hacker forums, many analysts speculated that Beijing had employed civilian hackers as
proxies to launch the attacks. A leading security-intelligence analyst says he received several
dozen tips from sources in China suggesting that, “in point of fact, it was the P.R.C. government
taking or demanding access to some of the research that the hackers had been doing, and then
using it themselves.”
The analyst goes on: “The Chinese government has employed this same tactic in numerous
intrusions. Because their internal police and military have such a respected or feared voice
among the hacking community, they can make use of the hackers’ research with their
knowledge and still keep the hackers tight-lipped about it. The hackers know that if they step
out of line they will find themselves quickly in a very unpleasant prison in western China,
turning large rocks into smaller rocks.” In an undated cable made public by WikiLeaks, one
American diplomat in Beijing reported to Washington that Aurora was an act of revenge
Page 8 of 14

ordered by a Chinese politburo member who had Googled himself and found a raft of
unflattering articles.
The SecurID hack used the same basic technique as Operation Aurora and many other recent
intrusions, though it made use of different specific tools. The technique, called “spearphishing,” begins with reconnaissance to find personal information about a company’s
employees. The Adversary may troll social-networking sites, including
Facebook and Twitter, or may research e-mail archives exfiltrated in

“The initial machine is just a beachhead,” explains McAfee’s Dmitri
Alperovitch. “From that point, the Adversary will move into document
repositories, e-mail archive servers, proceed to take the data and ship it
out of the company through another mechanism, typically by setting up a second, commandand-control server that they will exfiltrate data to. From the moment you’ve clicked on the
malware, there is another individual on the other end adapting to your network eco-system,
your security system, and trying various things until they succeed in getting what they want. It’s
like a Predator drone in Pakistan that’s being controlled by a joystick in Nevada.”
Some of the types of tools that the RSA hackers used—the rat , the command-and-controlserver infrastructure, and the remote domains—had previously been employed in a persistent
series of attacks on the Department of Defense and other U.S.-government systems. These
attacks were originally code-named Titan Rain. After Titan Rain was made public, it was rechristened with the code name Byzantine Hades, and after that name, too, was made public,
Byzantine Hades was re-dubbed with at least three more new classified code names, according
to a former N.S.A. analyst. Some top intrusion specialists attribute this series of attacks to a
group in China called the Red Hacker Alliance, which has suspected ties to the People’s
Liberation Army. (The particular malware and command-and-control servers used in the
SecurID hack, however, were unique, and had not been used in previous attacks.)

Act of War?
On May 21, the computer systems of America’s largest military contractor, Lockheed Martin,
detected an intruder. A week later, Lockheed acknowledged the breach in a statement. The
company called the attack “significant and tenacious” but also said that it had been detected
“almost immediately,” at which point the company took “aggressive” actions to stop it. “Our
Page 9 of 14

systems remain secure; no customer, program or employee personal data has been
compromised,” the statement said—leaving open the questions of how an intrusion could be
both “tenacious” and detected “almost immediately,” and how it could be “significant” without
compromising any data. The event was noteworthy enough that President Obama was briefed
on the situation. An unnamed Lockheed executive told The New York Times investigators
“cannot rule out” a connection to the RSA breach. RSA said that it was “premature to
speculate” on the cause of the attack.
On May 31, news broke that L-3 Communications, which provides intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance technology to the U.S. government, had also been attacked, according to an email to L-3 employees dated April 6. The e-mail said that L-3 had been “actively targeted with
penetration attacks leveraging the compromised information” from the RSA breach. When
asked whether intruders had gained the ability to clone SecurID key fobs, an RSA spokeswoman
said, “That’s not something we had commented on and probably never will.”
The next day, June 1, Fox News reported that Northrop Grumman had cut off remote access to
its network without warning, resetting domain names and passwords, and causing “chaos”
across the company, according to an unnamed Northrop executive. The company’s official
response to Fox’s questions on the matter was, verbatim, the same as its response to my
questions about previous reported hacks, going back several years: “We
do not comment on whether or not Northrop Grumman is or has been
a target for cyber intrusions.”
This onslaught of
revelations was all
the more
extraordinary
because American
industry has so few
incentives to come
clean about its
losses, and so many
incentives to cover
them up.

That same day, Google made its first allegation of Chinese hacking since
Operation Aurora, announcing that it had thwarted an attempt from
China to steal the Gmail passwords of senior U.S. government officials.
The next week, on June 7, RSA’s Art Coviello gave a mea culpa interview
to The Wall Street Journal, admitting that the entire SecurID system was
compromised, offering to replace practically all of the millions of tokens
on the market—and infuriating many of its customers, some of whom
were reported to be sundering their relationship with RSA and hiring
new security companies. Coviello says that he made the replacement
offer because, “post-Lockheed, customers had a lower tolerance for
risk,” and he says that “less than 10 percent of our customers have
requested replacement tokens.”

This onslaught of revelations was all the more extraordinary because
American industry has so few incentives to come clean about its losses, and so many incentives
to cover them up. Was it a coincidence that, only hours before Northrop’s and Google’s alleged
hacks became public, the Pentagon provided an element of its forthcoming cyber-war strategy
to The Wall Street Journal, declaring that the U.S. will consider some cyber-attacks to be the
equivalent of physical acts of war?

Like so many Rip Van Winkles, most of Washington has been asleep while cyber-attacks
proliferated. But a few voices have been trying to wake the town up. One belongs to Scott Borg,
director and chief economist of the U.S. Cyber-Consequences Unit, whose research indicates
that China, to sustain economic growth, “is relying increasingly on large-scale information theft.
This means that cyber attacks are now a basic part of China’s national development strategy.”
Another voice is that of James A. Lewis, a former diplomat who now leads the Technology and
Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He says, “The thing
we have to work through is, how do we want to work with the Chinese on this issue? This
administration has decided they want to cooperate, not have a confrontation.” A senior State
Department official elaborates: “One of the core things we’re trying to do diplomatically is to
build a consensus internationally to build norms of behavior, rules of the road,” as described in
the president’s “International Strategy for Cyberspace.” (The norms include “Upholding
Fundamental Freedoms,” “Respect for Property,” and “Right of Self-Defense.”) James A. Lewis
goes on: “This is what we did on missile proliferation. Our allies showed up and we all said,
‘Here are the norms.’ But how do we get a flow of countries to show up and say, ‘You’re
crossing a line. Back off, or there will be consequences’? What is the cost to the Chinese right
now? Until there is some cost, they’re not going to stop.”
Another White House document, the “Comprehensive National CyberSecurity Initiative,” as
well as several bills in Congress, propose ways of protecting critical infrastructure, such as
electrical grids, from cyber-intrusions. China has so thoroughly probed and mapped our power
system that former director of national intelligence Dennis Blair once publicly admitted that “a
number of nations, including Russia and China, can disrupt elements of the U.S. information
infrastructure.”
Still others are trying to address the economic
impact of cyber-espionage. On May 11, Senator
Jay Rockefeller and several of his colleagues sent
a letter to Mary Schapiro, chair of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, asking the
S.E.C. to issue interpretive guidance for
companies about disclosing material risk due to
cyber-breaches. The morning Rockefeller sent his
letter, Tom Kellermann, a former cyber-security
specialist at the World Bank, told me that the
S.E.C. would force companies to make significant
disclosures. “The dragon lady’s gonna rain down
fire,” he said.

CIO: “We’re not regulated or audited, so there
won’t be any fines.”
CFO: “You get no budget.”

The dragon lady has her work cut out for her. One industrial-control-systems security specialist
recalls a conversation with a chief financial officer and a chief information officer of a major
corporation after finding 65 vulnerabilities in the company’s networks, which would have

required a huge investment to fix. “What’s the worst that can happen if we don’t fix any of
these?” the C.F.O. asked.
“We have large exposure,” answered the C.I.O. “We could potentially be attacked—”
“No, no, no. What is the financial impact if we don’t do any of these?”
“We’re not regulated or audited, so there won’t be any fines.”
The C.F.O. answered, “You get no budget,” and the topic was closed.
The persistent culture of secrecy surrounding all things cyber compounds the difficulty of taking
practical steps against Chinese hacking. Much, perhaps most, information about cyber-conflict
of all types is classified, which creates tremendous practical problems of communication.
Sometimes, when the F.B.I. learns of an intrusion through classified channels, the Bureau has to
find other, unclassified evidence of the intrusion in order to be able to tell the victim what is
happening. “If it’s a defense contractor being hacked, then the victim company includes people
with clearances, so communication is easy. But if you’re talking about a company where no one
has clearances, that presents a significant problem”—and can create a significant time delay
between the discovery of a hack and the victim’s awareness of exposure, according to one
cyber-security analyst.

Playing the Fool
Yet the deeper I delved into the Chinese hacking problem, the more I discovered a network of
individuals in government and the private sector who are serving as a semi-official Resistance in
this secret war. A handful of influential congressional staffers who shape Hill debate on these
matters put me in touch with top intrusion specialists who are former hackers, military
personnel, or National Security Agency officials. These analysts are the civilian, cyber-equivalent
of special-ops forces. When my phone rang very late one night this spring, I was surprised to
see the name of one of these analysts on the screen. In the mood to talk, he spent most of an
hour describing his work to me, naming names and counting losses with shocking precision,
though forbidding me to repeat the details of his disclosures.
In this conversation—the first of several that took place over the following months—the man
said that he had started his career protecting government networks against foreign attacks. On
that job, he became so preoccupied with the scale of Chinese hacking that a senior military
officer told him to stop talking about it, with the gruff explanation that “the reason this is still
going on is that the Chinese government now owns us.” Frustrated, the analyst eventually left
government service for the private sector.
The problem may be reaching a boil that will take significant willpower to ignore. In mid-July,
the security firm McAfee shared exclusively with Vanity Fair the results of its latest cyberPage 12 of 14

espionage investigation. McAfee reports that,
over a period of five years, a single Adversary
penetrated more than 70 organizations, from
giant multi-national corporations to tiny
nonprofits, representing more than 30 industries
around the world, and exfiltrated intellectual
property—including e-mail archives, legal
contracts, negotiation plans for business activities, design schematics, and government
secrets—as soon as its spear-phishing victims clicked on a link to a Web page. One country’s
Olympic committee was compromised for a full 28 months; many other organizations were
compromised for two whole years. McAfee has given the name Operation Shady rat to this set
of intrusions. Dmitri Alperovitch, who discovered Operation Shady rat, draws a stark lesson:
“There are only two types of companies—those that know they’ve been compromised, and
those that don’t know. If you have anything that may be valuable to a competitor, you will be
targeted, and almost certainly compromised.”

“There are only two types of companies—those
that know they’ve been compromised, and
those that don’t know. If you have anything that
may be valuable to a competitor, you will be
targeted, and almost certainly compromised.”

The full list of Operation Shady rat’s victims includes government agencies and corporations
worldwide. The vast majority of victims—more than two-thirds of the total—are in the U.S.
Among the other countries targeted are Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
India, Germany, and the U.K. In 2007, the year before the Beijing Olympics, one international
athletics organization and the Olympic committees of three different countries were breached
by this intruder. Alperovitch believes the targeting of the Olympic committees and of American
political nonprofits suggests the intrusions were state-sponsored, explaining, “There’s no
economic gain to compromising them.” When asked if the People’s Republic of China was
conceivably behind Shady rat —given that China was not itself attacked—Alperovitch noted
that McAfee’s policy was not to comment on attribution. He added, “If others want to draw
that conclusion, I certainly wouldn’t discourage them.”
Another security researcher who was on the front lines during
Operation Aurora says, “Those of us who are hands-onkeyboard want this story to be told, because we feel like the
top corporate managers—following the advice of their
lawyers—are reflexively keeping breach information secret
from other companies that are trying to defend themselves.
In the big picture, a little bit of short-term embarrassment is
worth it, to get the American people to understand that
there’s a low-level Cold War going on.”

“…the top corporate
managers—following the
advice of their lawyers—are
reflexively keeping breach
information secret from other
companies that are trying to
defend themselves.

Despite—and also because of—the extreme secrecy
surrounding industrial cyber-espionage, this phenomenon is gradually effecting a fundamental
re-arrangement of the relationship between state and corporate power.

Michael Hayden was the director of the N.S.A. and then the C.I.A. during the period when the
problem of Chinese cyber-espionage developed. In a conversation with him about Operation
Aurora, I asked what he believed to be the most significant fact about those intrusions.
He answered, “You see Google acting in some ways as nation-states used to act, exercising to
the best of their ability some attributes traditionally associated with sovereign states. ‘We’re
going to break relationship’—cease doing business there, you know. It’s something I dwell on a
lot. The cyberworld is so new that the old structures, you know—state, non-state, public,
private—they all break down …
The last time we had such a powerful discontinuity is probably the European discovery of the
Western Hemisphere. At that point, we had some big, multi-national corporations—East India
Company and Hudson’s Bay—that acted as states. And I see elements of that with the big
Microsofts and Googles of the world. Because of their size, they actually are making decisions
that have the impact of the kinds of decisions made in the halls of government. Google is not a
state. But what constitutes Google’s inherent right of self-defense in this new environment
against this kind of attack? I’m not accusing anyone of doing anything wrong. These situations
are just so different. What do we believe would be legitimate for Google to do in response to
this? Now, I don’t have answers. I really don’t know, but it’s a really good question.”
Operation Starlight has an old-fashioned answer to that question: Find the culprits and put
them to shame. Its draft report declares: “The attacker’s name, telephone number records, and
other pertinent information should be divulged to the public in order to support attacker
attribution and assist in tracking back to the source.”
But no one believes that this tactic by itself will solve the
problem—or that corporations will embrace their long-term best
interest anytime soon. Rather, so long as executives and politicians
are guided by short-term self-interest, they will continue to play the
fool to the country that would be king.
“You need to consider: What are the subconscious assumptions
that companies bring to the issue of foreign cyber-attacks on their
networks?” a senior Senate staffer who works on cyber-issues
asked me.

“The difference with
cyber is there are
people trying to fly
planes into buildings
every day now.
And everybody just
looks the other way.”

“They assume that if something bad happens government will take care of the losses. They act
like they don’t really believe that a bank could get completely taken out, or that a tech giant
could get its whole lunch eaten, because it sounds as fictional as 9/11 would have sounded
before it happened. But terrorism is not the best analogy here. Who could have imagined that
people would have flown airplanes into buildings? The difference with cyber is there are people
trying to fly planes into buildings every day now. And everybody just looks the other way.”
