FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Report
Affected Platforms: Windows
Impacted Parties: Japanese Minecraft Gamers
Impact:
Potential loss of files and money due to file encryption and destruction
and paying ransom
Severity Level:
Medium
Minecraft is one of the most popular digital games in the world. It was originally released in
May 2009 by Swedish game developer Mojang Studios, which was acquired by Microsoft in
2014 for US $2.5 billion. Initially released for the Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, the
game is now available on 22 platforms including video game consoles and mobile devices,
including Android and iOS. As its gaming population has steadily grown, reaching more than
1/4

140 million monthly active players in August 2021, Minecraft has never been more popular
12 years after its initial release. Evidently, cybercriminals cannot pass up the opportunity to
target such a large userbase.
FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a variant of the Chaos ransomware that appears to
target Minecraft gamers in Japan. This variant not only encrypts certain files but also
destroys others, rendering them unrecoverable. If gamers fall prey to the attack, choosing to
pay the ransom may still lead to a loss of data. In this report we will take a look at how this
new ransomware variant works.

Ransomware Lure Being Posted to Japanese Minecraft Forums
Gamers create “alt” (alternative) accounts within Minecraft for various purposes (both good
and bad): they allow them to antagonize/troll other players without having their main account
banned, they provide cover for an alternative in-game identity/personality, they help avoid
getting their main account banned for using cheats (gaining an unfair advantage over other
gamers), etc. FortiGuard Labs has discovered a variant of Chaos ransomware being hidden
in a file pretending to contain a list of “Minecraft Alt” accounts that leads us to believe that the
effort is to target Minecraft gamers in Japan.
Even though they are often publicly available through Minecraft online forums, Alt Lists
contain stolen accounts that gamers can use to do the things listed above. That’s what the
threat actors behind this ransomware attack are using to lure victims to download and open
the file.
In this case, the file is an executable, but it uses a text icon to fool potential victims into
thinking it is a text file full of compromised usernames and passwords for Minecraft. While we
don’t know how this specific fake list is being distributed, it’s a safe guess that the file is
being advertised on Minecraft forums for Japanese gamers.

How the Executable Works
Once the executable file is opened, the malware searches for files smaller than 2,117,152
bytes on the compromised machine and encrypts them. It then appends those files with four
random characters chosen from “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890” as a file
extension.
But files larger than 2,117,152 bytes with specified file extensions are filled with random
bytes so the victim will not be able to get those files back even if the ransom is paid. Having
this destructive element changes this attack from a typical ransomware attack, and is a very
troubling component.

It is not known why the malware authors have chosen these file size values or why they
choose to encrypt some and destroy others. But it is interesting to note that the Chaos
malware was originally classified as a wiper malware with the ransomware component added
later.

Once the attack takes place, a dropped ReadMe.txt files ask the victim to pay a ransom in
either bitcoin or pre-paid cards. The requested amount to decrypt the files is equal to 2,000
yen (approx. US $17), which is dirt cheap compared to the amounts other ransomware
attacks typically demand. The ransom note does not specify which type of pre-paid card the
attacker wants. All kinds of pre-paid cards (online shopping, gaming, music, mobile phone
charge and online streaming services) are available in convenience stores. Japan has more
than 50,000 convenience store locations selling pre-paid cards and most are open 24/7.
The ransom note also states that the attacker is available only on Saturdays and apologizes
for any inconvenience caused. The malware does not include code to identify the language
setting of the compromised machine and the ransom note is available in Japanese only.
This, combined with the formal language of the ransom note, indicates this Chaos
ransomware variant specifically targets Japanese Windows users.

The ransomware also deletes shadow copies from the compromised machine, which
prevents the victim from being able to recover any files that had been encrypted, making it
doubly destructive. FortiGuard Labs previously released a blog about shadow copy deletion
carried out by ransomware. Luckily this Chaos ransomware variant does not have any code
to steal data from the compromised machine.
The malware also changes the desktop wallpaper, perhaps to add more pressure to the
victim to pay the ransom.

Conclusion - Chaos Ransomware Variant
There is nothing fancy about this Chaos ransomware variant nor its infection vector.
However, despite its cheap ransom demand, its ability to destroy data and render it
unrecoverable makes it more than a mere prank to annoy Japanese Minecraft gamers.
Ransomware is still ransomware, and in this case, the victim may not be able to get their
original files back, with or without making a ransom payment. The best advice is for players
to stay off suspicious gaming cheat sites and simply enjoy the game the way it was meant to
be played.

Fortinet Protections
FortiGuard Labs has AV coverage in place for all of the malicious file samples in the report
as:
MSIL/Filecoder.AGP!tr.ransom
Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations , potential impact to the reputation
of an organization, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable
information (PII), etc., it is important to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date.
