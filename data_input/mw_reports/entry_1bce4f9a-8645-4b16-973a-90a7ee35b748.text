This repository contains network and device indicators of compromised related to NSO
Group's Pegasus spyware. These indicators are a result of multiple investigations by the
Amnesty International Security Lab and other partners. Additional technical information was
collected as part of a collaborative investigation, the Pegasus Project coordinated by
Forbidden Stories and involving a global network of investigative journalists.
Amnesty International has released a Technical Methodology report which outlines how to
use these indicators to hunt for Pegasus and other mobile spyware products. The Amnesty
International Security Lab is also releasing an open-source tool, the Mobile Verification
Toolkit (MVT). MVT can be used with the the pegasus.stix2 indicators to check a devices for
potential signs of compromise with Pegasus spyware.
These indicators include:
domains.txt : list of all Pegasus-related domains, with sub-files:
v2_domains.txt : list of Pegasus Version 2 infrastructure. These domains were

identifed and published previously by Citizen Lab
