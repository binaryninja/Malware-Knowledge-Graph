The Trickbot trojan is one of the most advanced malware delivery vehicles currently in use.
Attackers have leveraged it to deliver a wide variety of malicious code, in many different
methods. Just yesterday, Bleeping Computer reported that news articles from President

Trump’s impeachment trial have been used to hide Trickbot from antivirus scanners.
On almost a daily basis, malicious actors reinvent Trickbot and work to find new pathways to
deliver the trojan onto user machines. This is what makes Trickbot among the most
advanced malware delivery vehicles; the constant evolution of methodologies used for
delivery.
The latest revision, which the Morphisec Labs team detected in new samples, leverages the
Windows 10 WSReset UAC Bypass to circumvent user account control and deliver its
payload onto user machines.

The Trickbot Trojan and Windows 10
The WSReset UAC Bypass process begins with Trickbot checking to see if the system it’s on
is running Windows 7 or Windows 10. If it is running under Windows 7, it will utilize the
CMSTPLUA UAC bypass (the same one as in previous samples). It’s only when the system
is running Windows 10 that Trickbot uses the WSReset UAC Bypass.

The WSReset UAC Bypass, discovered in March 2019, allows Trickbot authors to take
advantage of the WSReset.exe process. The WSReset.exe process is a Microsoft signed
executable that is used to reset Windows Store settings, according to its manifest file. What’s
most important here, though, is that the ‘autoElevate’ property is set to “true.” This is what
allows the WSReset UAC Bypass to be used for privilege escalation.

Trickbot decrypts its strings in order to use the WSReset UAC Bypass, such as the registry
path and the command to execute.

Next, Trickbot uses “reg.exe” in order to add the relevant keys that allows it to utilize the
WSReset UAC Bypass.

The final step in this bypass is to execute WSReset.exe, which will cause Trickbot to run with
elevated privileges without a UAC prompt. Trickbot does that using ‘ShellExecuteExW’ API.
This final executable allows Trickbot to deliver its payload onto workstations and other
endpoints.

Morphisec Secures Your Endpoints Against the Trickbot MALWARE
The Morphisec Unified Threat Prevention Platform blocks Trickbot before it is able to execute
its process, including the WSReset UAC Bypass, through the power of moving target
defense. By morphing the application memory structures on endpoints, we take away the
attackers’ ability to accurately target our customers’ critical systems. This protects
workstations, servers, VDIs, and cloud workloads against this and other damaging attacks.
