FLASH REPORT
Executive Summary
A major telecommunications and IT provider was targeted by an unknown threat actor​ ​as
part of an operation directed at disrupting the Olympic Games in PyeongChang. Recorded
Future identified hardcoded credentials for the IT provider embedded in the Olympic
Destroyer malware used in this campaign. Small amounts of code overlap connect the
malware to numerous, disparate threat groups, which ultimately does not help to identify
the threat actor responsible for developing the Olympic Destroyer malware.

Key Judgments
●

Olympic Destroyer should be treated with a high level of concern, due to the
destructive nature of the malware and its potent mechanisms to spread laterally.

●

Commentary and analysis surrounding malware code similarities of Olympic
Destroyer have yielded many leads but no conclusive attribution.

●

The co-occurrence of disparate code overlaps in the malware may be indicative of a
false flag operation, attempting to dilute evidence and confuse researchers.

Background
A major telecommunications and IT provider was targeted by an unknown threat actor​ ​as
part of targeting the Olympic Games in PyeongChang prior to December 2017.
The malware, commonly referred to as Olympic Destroyer, was initially identified by Talos
researchers​. Researchers have theorized that Olympic Destroyer was used t​ o disrupt​ the
Olympic Games opening ceremony on February 9. The destructive malware moves laterally
within a network via Psexec and WMI, to infect hosts and render their data useless. Psexec
and WMI are built-in Windows internal tools; Psexec is used to execute processes on other
systems in a shared network, and WMI is used to automate tasks on remote systems. The
malware also uses Mimikatz, a password-stealing tool, to extract credentials from a
compromised machine, also allowing it to move across the target network. M
​ icrosoft
researchers stated​ that there is also evidence of use of EternalRomance, a leaked exploit
recently abused by ransomware as a propagation method, but we were unable to verify
this claim.

Threat Analysis: A Two-Pronged Campaign
Recorded Future found an extended set of malware targeting the PyeongChang Games
using an additional set of Active Directory credentials. The diversity of credentials and
presence of a software key suggest that an early reconnaissance phase would likely involve
an initial malware infection and not just simple credential phishing.
All samples of the Olympic Destroyer malware variant targeting the IT provider were
timestamped five minutes prior to the compilation of the samples identified by Talos
researchers as targeting the PyeongChang 2018 network. This suggests a parallel,
two-pronged attempt to target the Olympics event, aimed at both organizers and
infrastructure providers.
Additional unreported malware hashes are contained in the appendix below.
Upon discovery of the hardcoded credentials, Recorded Future adhered to responsible
disclosure practices, notified the relevant IT provider, and provided details of the
campaign. An independent forensic investigation is underway and no damage is reported
at this time.

Technical Analysis: Attribution Remains Elusive
One of the most innovative techniques currently employed by advanced research teams is
hunting for code similarity at scale. Google researchers were the first to notably employ
this technique​ ​to cluster previously unattributed​ ​campaigns like that of North Korean
threat actor Scarcruft​ ​and WannaCry​, u
​ ltimately tying both to the Lazarus Group​ . ​BAE
researchers​ ​discovered​ t​ he first overlaps in malware used by BlueNoroff​ ​employed in the
Bangladesh SWIFT heist by noting use of a shared wiping function, once again pointing the
finger at North Korea. Kaspersky researchers used this method to​ ​link the trojan targeting
CCleaner​ ​to the Axiom group, and so on.
The trouble with this technique is that while code similarity can be stated with certainty,
down to a percentage of bytes shared, the results are not straightforward and require
expert interpretation. The Olympic Destroyer malware is a perfect example of how we can
be led astray by this clustering technique when our standard for similarity is too low.

FLASH REPORT

Olympic Destroyer remains unclustered and unattributed. Because this technique still
requires expert interpretation, casual or incomplete analysis can yield seemingly cohesive
narratives, for example, pointing in the direction of North Korea, China, or Russia. This
occurs when the code is looked at with a low enough correlative threshold.
Below are some disparate observations derived from the Olympic Destroyer malware
based on code similarity analysis:
China: ​Intezer researchers were the first to point to ​fragments of code similarity​ with
diverse threat actors in the general Chinese cluster, including APT3 (UPS), APT10
(menuPass), and APT12 (IXESHE).
North Korea:​ Our own research turned up trivial but consistent code similarities between
Olympic Destroyer modules and several malware families used by the Lazarus Group.
These include standard but different functions within ​BlueNoroff​ Banswift malware, the
LimaCharlie family of Lazarus malware from the Novetta Blockbuster r​ eport​, and a module
from the Lazarus SpaSpe malware meant to target domain controllers.
Before one concludes that these widely diverse threat actors have formed an axis of evil
intent on disrupting the Olympics, we need to take a step back and look at our research
techniques.
Code similarity historically yielded significant research findings in clustering new campaigns
to known threat actors and continues to hold great promise for research and malware
classification. However, it does require scrutiny and discernment when the similarity
threshold is so low as to focus on a few functions, or less. As with previous attributory
methods, researchers must remain vigilant to the ever-looming threat of adversary
adaptability.
Israeli nation-state-sponsored threat actor Flame leveraged a previously theoretical
cryptographic attack ​to spread laterally. Threat group Turla lead incident responders astray
by placing unrelated malware on their victims’ machines, and the Lamberts spliced random
clean code to use as encryption keys in order to avoid accurate clustering. Our adversaries
are resourceful. While fooling code similarity clustering takes significant effort and skill, we
must consider it possible for determined, higher-tier attackers with the right motivations.

FLASH REPORT

Outlook
The operation to disrupt the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games was more extensive
than originally reported, with both organizers and infrastructure targeted simultaneously.
The wealth of spreading mechanisms embedded within the malware suggests an
aggressive effort to spread within these networks and cause maximum damage. The
co-occurrence of code overlap in the malware may be indicative of a false flag operation,
attempting to dilute evidence and confuse researchers. For the time being, attribution
remains inconclusive.
