SECTION 25 10 10
UTILITY MONITORING AND CONTROL SYSTEM (UMCS) FRONT END AND INTEGRATION
02/19
**************************************************************************
NOTE: This guide specification covers the
requirements for a Utility Monitoring and Control
System (UMCS) Front End using Open protocols
(LonWorks, BACnet, Modbus, DNP and OPC), a UMCS
using the Niagara Framework, and the integration of
field control systems.
This specification includes tailoring options to
select the protocol(s) required to be supported at
the Monitoring and Controls Software (Front-end).
Note that unselected protocols can be integrated
through the use of a gateway.
This guide specification also includes tailoring
options for service-specific requirements for the
Air Force, Army and Navy as well as a "Service
Generic" tailoring option for use on other
projects. In order for this specification to be
properly tailored one (and only one) of the services
tailoring options (Air Force, Army, Navy, Service
Generic) must be selected.
Adhere to UFC 1-300-02 Unified Facilities Guide
Specifications (UFGS) Format Standard when editing
this guide specification or preparing new project
specification sections. Edit this guide
specification for project specific requirements by
adding, deleting, or revising text. For bracketed
items, choose applicable item(s) or insert
appropriate information.
Remove information and requirements not required in
the specific project, whether or not brackets are
present.
Comments, suggestions and recommended changes for
this guide specification are welcome and should be
submitted as a Criteria Change Request (CCR). CCRs
for this specification can be submitted through the

PART 1

GENERAL

**************************************************************************
NOTE: Use of this UFGS, and the UMCS design, must be
in accordance with UFC 3-470-01 Utility Monitoring
and Control System (UMCS) Front End and
Integration. The release process for UFCs is longer
than for UFGS. Once released UFC 3-470-01 will be
available online at
http://www.wbdg.org/
Note that the previous (outdated) version of the UFC
contains "LonWorks" in the title and should not be
used.

Template Points Schedules in electronic format for
use with this section are available online at the
Whole Building Design Guide page for this section:
http://www.wbdg.org/ffc/dod/unified-facilities-guide-specifications-ufgs/ufgs**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: NOTE ON THE USE OF THIS SECTION WITH OTHER
SECTION. When using this Section on the same
project with specifications for building control
systems (Section 23 09 00 INSTRUMENTATION AND
CONTROL FOR HVAC, 23 09 23.01 LONWORKS DIRECT
DIGITAL CONTROL FOR HVAC AND OTHER BUILDING CONTROL
SYSTEMS, 23 09 23.02 BACNET DIRECT DIGITAL CONTROL
FOR HVAC AND OTHER BUILDING CONTROL SYSTEMS) there
may requirements that appear at first to be
conflicting but which are actually designed to be
complementary.
For example, Section 23 09 00 INSTRUMENTATION AND
CONTROL FOR HVAC excludes a front end while this
section (Section 25 10 10) requires a front end this is to avoid getting multiple front ends.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: This specification makes use of SpecsIntact
Tailoring Options. This note describes these
options and how to use them.

"TAILORING OPTION NOTES" Tailoring Option
Each time tailoring options are used there is an
accompanying designer note describing the text that
is tailored. As this Section makes heavy use of
tailoring options there are many of these notes and
they can distract from designer notes describing
other decisions. The designer notes describing
tailoring options are all in a "TAILORING OPTION
NOTES" tailoring option which can be hidden (in
SpecsIntact select View-Tailoring Options and then
SECTION 25 10 10

Page 8

deselect "TAILORING OPTION NOTES") once this section
is tailored and the tailoring option notes are no
longer needed.

Protocol Tailoring Options
This specification includes tailoring options for
selection of protocol, and whether the Niagara
Framework is required. There are five tailoring
options:
1) BACNET: A (non-Niagara Framework) BACnet
front end (using a BACnet B-AWS)
2) LONWORKS:

A LonWorks front end using LNS.

3) NIAGARA FRAMEWORK:
front end

A Niagara Framework

4) MODBUS: The front end must also support the
MODBUS protocol.
5) OPC: The front end must also support OPC.
In general, it is recommended that only one of
BACNET, LONWORKS or NIAGARA FRAMEWORK be selected.
It is also recommended neither MODBUS and OPC be
selected with BACNET.
You have currently selected the following options:
---------BACNET
LONWORKS
NIAGARA FRAMEWORK
MODBUS
OPC
---------If you don't see any text between dashes above, you
have deselected all of the protocol tailoring
options and this specification is not valid. Select
at least one of the tailoring options.
If you see more than one line of text between the
dashes above you have left multiple tailoring
options related to protocol selected. This may
result in conflicting requirements. See UFC
3-470-01 UTILITY MONITORING AND CONTROL SYSTEM
(UMCS) FRONT END AND INTEGRATION to determine if one
or more tailoring options should be deselected.
Service Tailoring Option
This specification also includes tailoring options
for the Service (Air Force, Army, Navy) the
specification is used for. There is a "Service
Generic" tailoring option that can also be used.
Only ONE of the four tailoring options related to
the services should be used. You have currently
selected the following options:
---------AIR FORCE
SECTION 25 10 10

Page 9

ARMY
NAVY
SERVICE GENERIC
----------If more than one item appears between the dashes
above you have left more than one services tailoring
options selected and need to deselect all but one of
them.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: WARNING - The BACNET tailoring option has
been selected with another protocol tailoring option
(LONWORKS, MODBUS, NIAGARA FRAMEWORK). As described
in UFC 3-470-01, many of the Monitoring and Control
Software packages which support BACnet support ONLY
BACnet, so the inclusion of other protocol tailoring
options may unnecessarily limit the number of
vendors able to provide the UMCS. The need for
supporting multiple protocols at the Monitoring and
Control Software should be verified/checked with the
project site. Note that any protocol can be
integrated to the UMCS with the use of a gateway, so
omitting a tailoring option does not prohibit the
integration of systems using that protocol.
See UFC 3-470-01 for more information.
**************************************************************************

**************************************************************************
NOTE: WARNING - The NIAGARA FRAMEWORK tailoring
option has been selected with the LONWORKS tailoring
option. As described in UFC 3-470-01, LNS-based
LonWorks (required by the LONWORKS tailoring option)
is generally not compatible with the Niagara
Framework.
**************************************************************************

1.1.1

System Requirements

**************************************************************************
NOTE: Select the appropriate text in the type
specific communication system requirements to
indicate whether or not the IP network will be
Government furnished. If the IP network is *not*
Government furnished be sure to include complete
requirements for the IP network in the contract
package. This specification does not provide
sufficient requirements for the procurement of an IP
network.
Use "[an IP network as specified in [_____] and ]"
only if the contractor is expected to install an IP
network. In this case provide the information on
the specification for the IP network in the
"[_____]" provided.
For Army, coordinate with the installation (DPW and
NEC) but the default selection will be "[the
Government furnished IP network]"

DEFINITIONS

The following list of definitions may contain terms not found elsewhere in
this Section but are included here for completeness. Some terms are
followed with a protocol reference in parenthesis indicating to which
SECTION 25 10 10

Page 20

protocol the term and definition applies. Inclusion of protocol-specific
definitions does not create a requirement to support that protocol, nor
does it relax any requirements to support specific protocols as indicated
elsewhere in this section.
1.3.1

Alarm Generation

The process of comparing a point value (the point being alarmed) with a
pre-defined alarm condition (e.g. a High Limit) and performing some action
based on the result of the comparison.
1.3.2

Alarm Handling

see Alarm Routing
1.3.3

Alarm Routing

Alarm routing is M&C software functionality that starts with a notification
that an alarm exists (typically as the output of an Alarm Generation
process) and sends a specific message to a specific alarm recipient or
device.
1.3.4

Application Generic Controller (AGC)(LonWorks)

A device that is furnished with a (limited) pre-established application
that also has the capability of being programmed. Further, the ProgramID
and XIF file of the device are fixed. The programming capability of an AGC
may be less flexible than that of a General Purpose Programmable Controller
(GPPC).
1.3.5

Application Specific Controller (ASC)(LonWorks)

A device that is furnished with a pre-established built in application that
is configurable but not re-programmable. An ASC has a fixed
factory-installed application program (i.e Program ID) with configurable
settings.
1.3.6

BACnet (BACnet)

The term BACnet is used in two ways. First meaning the BACnet Protocol
Standard - the communication requirements as defined by ASHRAE 135
including all annexes and addenda. The second to refer to the overall
technology related to the ASHRAE 135 protocol.
1.3.7

BACnet Advanced Application Controller (B-AAC)(BACnet)

A hardware device BTL Listed as a B-AAC. A control device which contains
BIBBs in support of scheduling and alarming but otherwise has limited
resources relative to a B-BC. It may be intended for specific applications
and supports some degree of programmability.
1.3.8

BACnet Advanced Operator Workstation (B-AWS)(BACnet)

Monitoring and Control (M&C) Software BTL Listed as an Advanced Operator
Workstation and includes the ability to manage scheduling, alarming and
trending in an open manner. The B-AWS is the advanced operator's window
into a BACnet system. It is primarily used to monitor the performance of a
system and to modify parameters that affect the operation of a system.

SECTION 25 10 10

Page 21

1.3.9

BACnet Application Specific Controller (B-ASC)(BACnet)

A hardware device BTL Listed as a B-ASC. A controller with limited
resources relative to a B-AAC. It is intended for use in a specific
application and supports limited programmability.
1.3.10

BACnet Building Controller (B-BC)(BACnet)

A hardware device BTL Listed as a B-BC. A general-purpose,
field-programmable device capable of carrying out a variety of building
automation and control tasks including control and monitoring via direct
digital control (DDC) of specific systems and data storage for trend
information, time schedules, and alarm data. Like the other BTL Listed
controller types (B-AAC, B-ASC etc.) a B-BC device is required to support
the server ("B") side of the ReadProperty and WriteProperty services, but
unlike the other controller types it is also required to support the client
("A") side of these services. Communication between controllers requires
that one of them support the client side and the other support the server
side, so a B-BC is often used when communication between controllers is
needed.
1.3.11

BACnet Internetwork (BACnet)

Two or more BACnet networks connected with BACnet routers. In a BACnet
Internetwork, there exists only one message path between devices.
1.3.12

BACnet Interoperability Building Blocks (BIBBs) (BACnet)

A BIBB is a collection of one or more BACnet services intended to define a
higher level of interoperability. BIBBs are combined to build the BACnet
functional requirements for a device in a specification. Some BIBBs define
additional requirements (beyond requiring support for specific services) in
order to achieve a level of interoperability. For example, the BIBB DS-V-A
(Data Sharing-View-A), which would typically be used by an M&C client, not
only requires the client to support the ReadProperty Service, but also
provides a list of data types (Object / Properties) which the client must
be able to interpret and display for the user.
1.3.13

BACnet Operator Display (B-OD)(BACnet)

A hardware device BTL Listed as a B-OD. A basic operator interface with
limited capabilities relative to a B-OWS. It is not intended to perform
direct digital control. The B-OD profile could be used for wall-mounted
LCD devices, displays affixed to BACnet devices; hand-held terminals or
other very simple user interfaces.
1.3.14

BACnet Operator Workstation (B-OWS)(BACnet)

Monitoring and Control (M&C) Software BTL Listed as a B-OWS. An operator
interface with limited capabilities relative to a B-AWS. The B-OWS is used
for monitoring and basic control of a system, but differs from a B-AWS in
that it does not support configuration activities, nor does it provide
advanced troubleshooting capabilities.
1.3.15

BACnet Smart Actuator (B-SA)(BACnet)

A hardware device BTL Listed as a B-SA. A simple control output device with
limited resources; it is intended for specific applications.

SECTION 25 10 10

Page 22

1.3.16

BACnet Smart Sensor (B-SS)(BACnet)

A hardware device BTL Listed as a B-SS. A simple sensing device with very
limited resources.
1.3.17

BACnet Testing Laboratories (BTL)(BACnet)

Established by BACnet International to support compliance testing and
interoperability testing activities and consists of BTL Manager and the BTL
Working Group (BTL-WG). BTL also publishes Implementation Guidelines.
1.3.18

BACnet Testing Laboratories (BTL) Listed (BACnet)

A device that has been certified by BACnet® Testing Laboratory. Devices
may be certified to a specific device profile, in which case the
certification indicates that the device supports the required capabilities
for that profile, or may be certified as "other".
1.3.19

Binary

A two-state system or signal; for example one where an "ON" condition is
represented by a high signal level and an "OFF" condition is represented by
a low signal level. 'Digital' is sometimes used interchangeably with
'binary'.
1.3.20

Binding (LonWorks)

The act of establishing communications between CEA-709.1-D devices by
associating the output of a device to the input of another so that
information is automatically (and regularly) sent without being requested
by the recipient.
1.3.21

Broadcast

Unlike most messages, which are intended for a specific recipient device, a
broadcast message is intended for all devices on the network.
1.3.22

Building Control Network (BCN)

The network used by the Building Control System. Typically the BCN is a
BACnet ASHRAE 135 or LonWorks CEA-709.1-D network installed by the building
control system contractor.
1.3.23

Building Control System (BCS)

One type of Field Control System. A control system for building electrical
and mechanical systems, typically HVAC (including central plants) and
lighting. A BCS generally uses Direct Digital Control (DDC) Hardware and
generally does NOT include its own local front end.
1.3.24

Building Point of Connection (BPOC)

A FPOC for a Building Control System. (This term is being phased out of
use in preference for FPOC but is still used in some specifications and
criteria. When it was used, it typically referred to a piece of control
hardware. The current FPOC definition typically refers instead to IT
hardware)

SECTION 25 10 10

Page 23

1.3.25

Channel (LonWorks)

A portion of the control network consisting of one or more segments
connected by repeaters. Channels are separated by routers. The device
quantity limitation is dependent on the topology/media and device type.
For example, a TP/FT-10 network with locally powered devices is limited to
128 devices per channel.
1.3.26

Commandable (BACnet)

A point (Object) is commandable if its Present_Value Property is writable
and it supports the optional Priority_Array Property. This functionality
is useful for Overrides.
1.3.27

Configuration Property (LonWorks)

Controller parameter used by the application which is usually set during
installation/testing and seldom changed. For example, the P and I settings
of a P-I control loop. Also see 'Standard Configuration Property Type
(SCPT)'
1.3.28

Control Logic Diagram

A graphical representation of control logic for multiple processes that
make up a system.
1.3.29

Device Object (BACnet)

Every BACnet device requires one Device Object, whose properties represent
the network visible properties of that device. Every Device Object
requires a unique Object_Identifier number on the BACnet Internetwork.
This number is often referred to as the device instance or device ID.
1.3.30

Explicit Messaging (LonWorks)

A non-standard and often vendor (application) specific method of
communication between devices.
1.3.31

External Interface File (XIF) (LonWorks)

A file which documents a device's external interface, specifically the
number and types of LonMark objects, the number, types, directions, and
connection attributes of network variables, and the number of message tags.
1.3.32

Field Point Of Connection (FPOC)

The FPOC is part of the UMCS IP network and acts as the point of connection
between the UMCS IP Network and the field control IP network. The FPOC is
an IT device such as a switch, IP router, or firewall, typically managed by
the site IT staff. (Note that the field control IP network may consist of a
single IP device, or that integration may require installation of a field
control network IP device.)
1.3.33

Field Control Network

The network used by a field control system.

SECTION 25 10 10

Page 24

1.3.34

Framework. By default, Fox uses TCP port 1911
1.3.36

Functional Profile (LonWorks)

A standard description, defined by LonMark International, of a LonMark
Object used to classify and certify devices.
1.3.37

Gateway

A device that translates from one protocol to another. Devices that change
only the transport mechanism of the protocol - "translating" from LonWorks
over TP/FT-10 to LonWorks over IP for example - are not gateways as the
underlying protocol (data format) does not change. Gateways are also
called Communications Bridges or Protocol Translators.
1.3.38

General Purpose Programmable Controller (GPPC) (LonWorks)

Unlike an ASC or AGC, a GPPC is not furnished with a fixed application
program and does not have a fixed ProgramID or XIF file. A GPPC can be
(re-)programmed, usually using vendor-supplied software. When a change to
the program affects the external interface (and the XIF file) the ProgramID
will change.

To change the value of a point outside of the normal sequence of operation
where this change has priority over the sequence. An override can be
accomplished in one of two ways: the point itself may be Commandable and
written to with a priority or there may be a separate point on the
controller for the express purpose of implementing the override.
Typically this override is from the Utility Monitoring and Control System
(UMCS) Monitoring and Control (M&C) Software. Note that this definition is
not standard throughout industry.
1.3.61

Point, Calculated

A value within the M&C Software that is not a network point but has been
calculated by logic within the software based on the value of network

identifies the node manufacturer, functionality of device (application &
sequence), transceiver used, and intended device usage.
1.3.65

Property (BACnet)

A BACnet Property - a data element associated with an Object. Different
Objects have different Properties, for example an Analog Input Object has a
Present_Value Property (which provides the value of the underlying hardware
analog input), a High_Limit Property (which contains a high limit for
alarming), as well as other properties.
1.3.66

Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS)(BACnet)

A document, created by the manufacturer of a device, which describes which
potions of the BACnet standard are implemented by a given device.
1.3.67

Repeater

A device that connects two control network segments and retransmits all
information received on one side onto the other.
1.3.68

Router (LonWorks)

A device that connects two channels and controls traffic between the
channels by retransmitting signals received from one subnet onto the other
based on the signal destination. Routers are used to subdivide a control
network and to control bandwidth usage.
1.3.69

Router (BACnet)

A device that connects two or more BACnet networks and controls traffic
between the networks by retransmitting signals received from one network
onto another based on the signal destination. Routers are used to
subdivide an internetwork and to control bandwidth usage.
1.3.70

Segment

A 'single' section of a control network that contains no repeaters or
routers. There is generally a limit on the number of devices on a segment,
and this limit is dependent on the topology/media and device type. For
example, a TP/FT-10 segment with locally powered devices is limited to 64
devices, and a BACnet MS/TP segment is limited to 32 devices.
SECTION 25 10 10

1.3.71

Service (BACnet)

A BACnet Service. A defined method for sending a specific type of data
between devices. Services are always defined in a Client-Server manner,
with a Client initiating a Service request and a Server Executing the
Service. Some examples are ReadProperty (a client requests a data value
from a server), WriteProperty (a client writes a data value to a server),
and CreateObject (a client requests that a server create a new object
within the server device).
1.3.72

Service Pin (LonWorks)

A hardware push-button on a device which causes the device to broadcast a
message containing its Node ID and Program ID. This broadcast can also be
initiated via software.
1.3.73

Standard BACnet Object/Property/Service (BACnet)

BACnet Objects, Properties, or Services that are standard Objects,
Properties, or Services enumerated and defined in ASHRAE 135. Clause 23 of

1.3.75

Standard Network Variable Type (SNVT) (LonWorks)

Pronounced 'snivet'. A standard format type (maintained by LonMark
International) used to define data information transmitted and received by
the individual nodes. The term SNVT is used in two ways. Technically it
is the acronym for Standard Network Variable Type, and is sometimes used in
this manner. However, it is often used to indicate the network variable
itself (i.e. it can mean "a network variable of a standard network variable
type"). In general, the intended meaning should be clear from the context.
1.3.76

Subnet (LonWorks)

Consists of a logical grouping of up to 127 nodes, where the logical
grouping is defined by node addressing. Each subnet is assigned a number
which is unique within the Domain. See also Node Address.

For the Niagara Framework, point licensing only
applies to points directly integrated to the Web
Supervisor without first being brought into a
Niagara Framework Supervisory Gateway. Discuss with
the installation whether integration will generally
be accomplished via Niagara Framework Supervisory
Gateways (this is the normal method) or not before
determining a point licensing requirement When
integration will "always" be through a Niagara
Framework Supervisory Gateway change the number of
network points required below to zero or a very
small number. When requiring network points
indicate in the space provided the protocol drivers
required and network points required to be licensed
by each.
This UFGS requires the use of Web based clients
(previous versions of this UFGS did not, but most
vendors support web-browser based clients and this
no longer overly restricts competition.)
FYI: The following paragraphs/pages (the M&C
software requirements) specify functionality that is
required for the M&C Software but that may not be
achievable due to lack of data/support at the
building level. In order to meet future needs these
requirements should be kept. It is expected that
they are usually part of the 'standard' capabilities
of this type of software.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: This subpart uses tailoring options to
indicate requirements for the M&C software in the
first paragraph. Only requirements related to
selected tailoring options are included.
**************************************************************************
Provide monitoring and control (M&C) software which is a client-server
software package with a graphical user interface (GUI) using web-browser
based clients. Provide Niagara Framework Web Supervisor or equivalent
Niagara Framework monitoring and control software which communicates with
Niagara Framework field control systems using the Fox protocol. Provide M&C
Software which communicates via CEA-709.1-D, and ASHRAE 135, and

other field control protocols. Provide M&C Software which is BACnet
Testing Laboratories Certified ("Listed") as a B-AWS.

SECTION 25 10 10

Page 53

Provide a single software package which implements the Scheduling,
Alarming, Trending, Graphical System Display, and System Display Editor
functionality. Other specified M&C functionality may be implemented in the
same software package or in additional software packages. As specified in
PART 3 EXECUTION, the M&C Software must operate on Server hardware, except
that software for Point Calculations and Demand Limiting may operate on M&C
Controller Hardware.
2.4.10.1

M&C Software License

License the M&C Software as specified. Use of multiple copies of M&C
Server software working in coordination and sharing data between them such
that they function as, and appear to an operator as, a single M&C Server is
permitted to meet these requirements.
2.4.10.1.1

Network Points

**************************************************************************
NOTE: This subpart uses tailoring options:
1) The sentence referring to Niagara Framework
systems is included only when the NIAGARA FRAMEWORK
tailoring option is selected.
2) The sentence referring to Web Supervisor M&C
Software is only included when the NIAGARA FRAMEWORK
tailoring option is selected.
**************************************************************************
For Niagara Framework systems, a network point is a point brought directly
into the Web Supervisor M&C Software through a protocol other than the Fox
Protocol and via a Niagara Framework Supervisory Gateway. Provide M&C
Software and licensing to support no less than than [_____] network points,
and to be capable of expansion to support no less than [50,000] [_____]
network points. [Provide Web Supervisor M&C Software which includes the
following drivers, each of whish is licensed for a number of network points
as follows: [____].]
2.4.10.1.2

Web Clients

Provide M&C Software and licensing to support no less than [10] [____]
simultaneous web clients with no limit on the total number of web clients.
M&C Software must be capable of expansion to support no less than [30]
[_____] simultaneous web clients.
2.4.10.1.3

Calculations

Provide M&C Software and licensing to support no less than one calculated
point for every ten network points (see "Network Points" above).
2.4.10.1.4

Other Points

For installations using M&C Software installed on M&C Controller Hardware
(as opposed to Server hardware), provide additional licensing to support
additional network points for the communications between portions of the
M&C Software installed on different hardware. For example, if the
Calculations requirement is performed by M&C Software installed on
Controller hardware, the M&C Software must be licensed for additional
network points to cover the network points required for communication
between the Controller hardware and the Server hardware.
SECTION 25 10 10

2.4.10.1.5

Alarming

**************************************************************************
NOTE: This subpart uses tailoring options:
1) the phrase "alarm generation and" and the work
"points" is included if the LONWORKS, MODBUS or OPC
tailoring option is selected.
2) the phrase "ASHRAE 135 Alarm Event Notifications"
is included if the BACNET tailoring option is
selected.
**************************************************************************
Provide M&C Software and licensing to support alarm generation and the
handling (routing) of alarms for no less than [10,000] [_____] points and
ASHRAE 135 Alarm Event Notifications.
2.4.10.1.6

Trending

Provide M&C Software and licensing to support a minimum of [8,000] [_____]
simultaneous trends.
[2.4.10.1.7

Scheduling

**************************************************************************
NOTE: This subpart only applies to LonWorks,
Modbus, or OPC systems and is only included when the
LONWORKS, MODBUS or OPC tailoring option is selected.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: When LonWorks tailoring is selected, this
paragraph appears in brackets. This is due to
changes in the requirements for LonWorks field
control systems. Until recently LonWorks did not
support an open means of configuring schedules in
field control systems, so all scheduling was done at
the M&C Software. The Simple Schedule Functional
Profile now provides a standard means for schedule
configuration in the field control systems, and is a
requirement in Section 23 09 23.01 LONWORKS DIRECT
DIGITAL CONTROL FOR HVAC AND OTHER BUILDING CONTROL
SYSTEMS.
Keep the bracketed text for Modbus or OPC, or to
maintain compatibility with LonWorks systems which
do not employ the Simple Scheduler and thus require
scheduling at the M&C Software. If Modbus and OPC
are not required and all LonWorks field control
systems will use the Simple Scheduler, the bracketed
text can be removed.
When uncertain, keep the bracketed text as most M&C
Software can support this requirement and keeping
the ability to perform scheduling at the M&C
Software will support a wider range of field control
systems.
**************************************************************************
SECTION 25 10 10

Page 55

Provide M&C Software and licensing to support a minimum of [200] [_____]
user-definable schedules.
]2.4.10.1.8

Niagara Framework Open License

**************************************************************************
NOTE: This subpart only applies to Niagara
Framework systems and is only included when the
NIAGARA FRAMEWORK tailoring option is selected.
**************************************************************************
Provide M&C Software with an unrestricted interoperability license and a
Niagara Compatibility Statement (NiCS) which follows the Tridium Open NiCS
Specification.
2.4.10.2

M&C Software Update Licensing

**************************************************************************
NOTE: The installation may procure its own software
update licensing or contract and thus need less than
5 years. Alternatively the installation may require
longer than five years (although this will likely
increase the costs significantly). Coordinate with
the installation to determine if they have any
specific requirement; if they don't then keep the 5
year requirement.
**************************************************************************
In addition to all other licensing requirements, provide M&C Software
licensing which includes licensing of the following software updates for a
period [of no less than 5 years][____]:
a.

Security and bug-fix patches issued by the M&C Software manufacturer.

b.

Security patches to address any vulnerability identified in the
National Vulnerability Database at http://nvd.nist.gov with a Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity rating of MEDIUM or higher.

2.4.10.3

Supported Field Control Protocols

**************************************************************************
NOTE: FYI: one of the integration methods for
legacy systems is to use a protocol driver (a
'software gateway') in the M&C software to integrate
the legacy system, and these requirements permit the
M&C Software to support protocols other than those
specifically required in this specification.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: WARNING - The BACnet tailoring option has
been selected with another protocol tailoring option
(LonWorks, Modbus, OPC). As described in UFC
3-470-01, many of the Monitoring and Control
Software packages which support BACnet support ONLY
BACnet, so the inclusion of other protocol tailoring
options may unnecessarily limit the number of
vendors able to provide the UMCS. The need for
SECTION 25 10 10

Page 56

supporting multiple protocols at the Monitoring and
Control Software should be verified/checked with the
project site. Note that any protocol can be
integrated to the UMCS with the use of a gateway, so
omitting a tailoring option does not prohibit the
integration of systems using that protocol.
See UFC 3-470-01 for more information.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: WARNING - The Niagara Framework tailoring
option has been selected with the LonWorks tailoring
option. As described in UFC 3-470-01, LNS-based
LonWorks (required by the LonWorks tailoring option)
is generally not compatible with the Niagara
Framework.
See UFC 3-470-01 for more information.
**************************************************************************

NOTE: FYI: For BACnet systems it is expected that
there will be Scheduling Objects in the field
control system and the M&C Software will edit
SECTION 25 10 10

Page 62

(configure) these schedules.

For LonWorks the M&C software will be the primary
method of scheduling; building systems have 'backup'
scheduling capability in the event of a loss of
communication with the M&C Software Server.

For Niagara Framework systems it is expected that
there will be Niagara Framework Scheduling Objects
in the Niagara Framework Supervisory Gateway(s) and
the M&C Software will edit (configure) these
schedules.
In general it is expected that Modbus and OPC will
be used for the integration of utility control
systems which will likely have their own scheduling
capability. In this case scheduling from the M&C
Software will be for secondary/supervisory functions.
Due to the use of tailoring options in the following
list of requirements not all requirements will be
included in all projects and items may require
renumbering.
