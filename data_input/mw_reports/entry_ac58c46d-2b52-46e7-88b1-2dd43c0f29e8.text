Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber
Espionage Activity Supports
Expansion of Regional Power and
Influence in Southeast Asia

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

This report profiles trends in Chinese state-sponsored cyber
espionage activity targeting Southeast Asian countries. The activity was
identified through large-scale automated network traffic analytics and
expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded Future Platform,
SecurityTrails, DomainTools, PolySwarm, Farsight, Team Cymru, and
common open-source tools and techniques. The research will be of most
interest to individuals engaged in strategic and operational intelligence
relating to the activities of Chinese military and foreign intelligence
agencies in cyberspace and network defenders with a presence in
Southeast Asia.

Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group tracks Chinese
state-sponsored cyber espionage operations targeting
government and private sector organizations across
Southeast Asia. In this report, we highlight multiple
examples of activity reported to Recorded Future clients
throughout 2021. The identified intrusion campaigns
almost certainly support key strategic aims of the
Chinese government, such as gathering intelligence
on countries engaged in South China Sea territorial
disputes or related to projects and countries strategically
important to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
The activity highlighted includes a group we
track as Threat Activity Group 16 (TAG-16 1), which
has compromised several high-profile military and
government organizations across Southeast Asia
throughout 2021 using custom malware families such
as FunnyDream and Chinoxy. Many of the governments
targeted by TAG-16 are engaged in ongoing disputes
with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea.
Additionally, we highlight 2 separate suspected Chinese
state-sponsored intrusion campaigns targeting entities
in Laos and Cambodia. Both are likely intended to support
BRI objectives. Victims in these 2 respective campaigns
include the National Committee for Special Economic
Zones (SEZs) and National Enterprise Database (NED)
in Laos and Cambodia’s Sihanoukville Autonomous Port
(PAS).

Key Judgments
• Our research highlights China’s continued
strategic and tactical interest in government
and private sector organizations in Southeast
Asia. This targeting is almost certainly linked
to a range of objectives intended to support
a deepening of regional influence, including
traditional intelligence gathering against regional
rivals and allies, economic intelligence gathering
against BRI-linked targets, and the South China
Sea disputes.
• The operational tasking of TAG-16 is likely
linked, in part, to gathering intelligence on
South China Sea-related issues. Notably, Insikt
Group identified the compromise of navies,
prime minister’s offices, ministries of defense,
and ministries of foreign affairs across several
countries with a presence in the South China
Sea.
• The targeting of Cambodia’s Sihanoukville
Autonomous Port and Laos’s National Committee
for SEZs is likely linked to China’s wider strategic
objectives under the BRI. PAS has high strategic
significance given its location along the Maritime
Silk Road route, while the Lao government has
promoted the development of SEZs as an entry
point for private sector development, including
domestic and foreign direct investment (FDI).

1
Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group or campaign,
such as RedFoxtrot, typically when analysts have data corresponding
to at least 3 points on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with
at least medium confidence. We will occasionally report on significant
activity using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-16,
where the activity is new and significant but doesn’t map to existing
groupings and hasn’t yet graduated or merged into an established
activity group.

Background
Insikt Group has reported extensively on Chinese statesponsored threat activity groups targeting countries surrounding
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In the past year, much of
this activity has focused on India, with groups such as RedEcho,
RedFoxtrot, and TAG-28 heavily targeting government and
private sector organizations following a significant increase in
tensions between the Indian and PRC governments. Alongside
this concentration on India, other Asian countries are also prime
targets of many PRC-sponsored groups. Much of this is likely
driven by traditional espionage goals, as well as supporting
strategic policy objectives like the Belt and Road Initiative and
Five-Year Plans. Southeast Asia is no exception to this, and
the South China Sea territorial disputes very likely constitute
another driver of China’s cyber espionage activity.

Based on Recorded Future adversary infrastructure
detection and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) techniques, in the
past 9 months, Insikt Group identified over 400 unique victim
servers located in Southeast Asia communicating with malware
command and control (C2) infrastructure with likely links to
Chinese state-sponsored actors. The top 3 targeted countries
within our data set were Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, with
known groups active in the region including RedDelta, Naikon,
and Goblin Panda, as well as temporary clusters we group as
TAG-16 and TAG-22.

Activity Spotlight: TAG-34 Targeting of Cambodian
Port Facility
In September 2021, Insikt Group identified intrusion activity
linked to a suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat activity
group targeting the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) and the country’s sole international and commercial
deep seapor t, Sihanoukville Autonomous Por t. Using
Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA), we detected
infrastructure linked to both of these entities communicating
with a ShadowPad C2 cluster over a sustained period, which we
currently track using the temporary group designator TAG-34.
While we do not attribute this activity to a known threat activity
group at this time, ShadowPad is a custom backdoor shared
across multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups.

While the targeting of Cambodia’s MOFA likely falls within the
scope of traditional cyber espionage, the activity aimed at PAS is
more likely linked to China’s objectives under the BRI. Although
the port is government owned, it is largely financed by Japanese
investment and is located near the China-owned Sihanoukville
Special Economic Zone (SSEZ), a key location for China’s BRIlinked projects within Cambodia. PAS also has high strategic
significance given its location along the Maritime Silk Road route,
along which Chinese companies have financed and built multiple
deep sea ports under the banner of the BRI. China and Japan
have historically vied for influence within Sihanoukville, with the
targeting of the PAS potentially supporting an effort to offset
Japanese influence within the province.
From at least June until October 2021, infrastructure
associated with these Cambodian organizations were identified
communicating with the ShadowPad C2 cluster highlighted
in Figure 5. As well as hosting overlaps, all of the identified
domains were registered through GoDaddy and use 1984 Hosting
nameservers. Originally considered unique to APT41 activity, in
recent years ShadowPad use has drastically expanded across
Chinese state-sponsored groups, with Insikt Group tracking at
least 7 distinct activity groups using the malware family.

Outlook
Our research highlights China’s continued strategic and
tactical interest in government and private sector organizations
in Southeast Asia. This targeting likely serves several objectives,
including traditional intelligence gathering against regional rivals
and allies, economic intelligence gathering against BRI-linked
targets, and the South China Sea disputes. Future activity
targeting rival South China Sea claimants is likely to increase in
line with geopolitical tensions.
The scale and scope of China’s cyber espionage program
remain unrivaled, exemplified by the large number of distinct
actors with operational taskings within specific geographic
regions. The countries surrounding China bear the brunt of this
activity and are prime targets of many PLA Strategic Support
Force (SSF) and Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked threat
activity groups.

Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy
Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat
actors and their activity, focusing on state actors from China,
Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cybercriminals —
individuals and groups — from Russia, CIS states, China,
Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity groups and
where possible, attributing them to nation state government,
organizations, or affiliate institutions.

ADVERSARY

Our coverage includes:
•

•

Government organizations and intelligence
agencies, their associated laboratories, partners,
industry collaborators, proxy entities, and
individual threat actors

INFRASTRUCTURE

Recorded Future-identified, suspected nationstate activity groups, such as RedAlpha,
RedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many
other industry established groups

•

Cybercriminal individuals and groups established
and named by Recorded Future

•

Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,
persistent commodity malware

CAPABILITY

VICTIM

Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group
or campaign, such as RedFoxtrot, when analysts typically
have data corresponding to at least three points on the
Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium
confidence. We will occasionally report on significant activity
using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-21
where the activity is new and significant but doesn't map
to existing groupings and hasn't yet graduated or merged
into an established activity group. We tie this to a threat
actor only when we can point to a handle, persona, person,
or organization responsible. We will write about the activity
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary
data. We use the most widely used or recognized name for a
particular group when the public body of empirical evidence
is clear the activity corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group uses a simple color and phonetic alphabet
naming convention for new nation-state threat actor groups
or campaigns. The color generally corresponds to that
nation’s flag colors, with more color/nation pairings to be
added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups
associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt
Group uses a naming convention corresponding to the
Greek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity
connected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate
country color, and where that group may be tied to a specific
government organization, tie it to that entity specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming
newly identified malware.
