Fact Sheet: TrickBot Malware
SUMMARY
TrickBot malware—first identified in 2016—is a Trojan developed and operated by a sophisticated group of cybercrime
actors. The cybercrime group initially designed TrickBot as a banking trojan to steal financial data. Through continued
development and new functionality, TrickBot has become a highly modular, multi-stage malware that provides its
operators a full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities. Since TrickBot’s inception, the cybercrime
group has used the malware to attack individuals and businesses globally across a wide range of sectors.

o Deploy additional malware (e.g., Ryuk 7 and Conti ransomware, Emotet downloader); and
o Load TrickBot into networks using other malware to achieve additional objectives.

Capabilities
•

TrickBot may be used
o To exfiltrate data (e.g., email, credentials, point-of-sale info);
o For cryptomining; and
o For host enumeration (e.g., reconnaissance of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or Basic
Input/Output System [UEFI/BIOS] firmware). 8
