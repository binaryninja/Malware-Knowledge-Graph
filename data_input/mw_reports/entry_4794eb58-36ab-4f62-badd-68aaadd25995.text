The Outlook backdoor used by Turla APT group for its espionage operations is an unusual
beast built for stealth and persistence, capable to survive in highly restricted networks.
The malware does not connect to a command and control server and can receive updates
and instructions via PDF files delivered to the victim’s email address. Its control depends
only on an email exchange that can originate from any address the attacker chooses.
Security researchers from ESET analyzed the functionality of the utility and managed to
learn how it can exfiltrate data without triggering the alarm.
The Turla group counts on this backdoor since at least 2013 and has developed it from a
basic utility that only dumped email content to a tool that can execute PowerShell
commands with the help of Empire PSInject open-source kit.

In its most recent reiterations, the backdoor is a standalone DLL (dynamic link library) that
can install itself and interact with Outlook and The Bat! email clients. It can do this
regardless of its location on the disk.
For persistence, Turla developers use COM object hijacking - a common, but effective
technique they’re well versed in. The method allows the malicious DLL to load each time
Outlook loads the COM object. The researchers noticed that this happens when the email
client starts.
Stealth is achieved by relying on the legitimate Messaging Application Programming
Interface (MAPI) to interact with Outlook and get access to the target’s inboxes.
The researchers say that the operator uses the email transport layer to deliver specially
crafted PDF documents containing commands for data exfiltration or for downloading
additional files. Information is extracted in the same way, by generating a PDF with the data
demanded by the attacker, like outgoing emails and message metadata.

“From the PDF documents, the backdoor is able to recover what attackers call a container
in the logs. This is a binary blob with a special format that contains encrypted commands for
the backdoor,” ESET analysts explain in a report released today.
“Technically, the attachment does not have to be a valid PDF document. The only
requirement is that it includes a container in the right format.”
To hide the email exchanges from the user, the backdoor deletes the messages sent to or
received from the attacker. New email notifications may appear for a few seconds, but the
message body is not shown to the user, which could pass as a glitch in the client software.
Although they did not get a PDF sample with commands for the backdoor, the researchers
were able to create such a document. Once sent to an Outlook inbox controlled by the
malware, it recognized the directions and launched the Calculator app in Windows.

The complexity of the Outlook backdoor component is also visible in its encryption
algorithm. Just like other tools bearing the Turla signature, the backdoor uses a less
common algorithm, which suffered customizations from the developer.
It employs MISTY1 symmetric encryption, created by Mitsubishi Electric in 1995. To the
original implementation, Turla added two XOR operations, changed the key generation
method. They also shuffled the values in the s7 and s9 non-linear look-up tables, causing
all tools that recognize cryptographic algorithms based on the s-table values to break.
With no command and control server to take down, a modus operandi that can pass as
legitimate activity to network security components, and modifications to standard functions,
Turla’s Outlook backdoor proves difficult to fight.
