INTRODUCTION
The number of targeted attacks is undoubtedly on the
rise. These highly targeted attacks focus on individual
organizations in an effort to extract valuable information.
In many ways, this is a return to the “old hacking days”
before more widespread attacks targeting millions of
users and the rise of computer worms came about.
Sometimes, these targeted attacks are allegedly linked to
state-sponsored activities but may also be carried out by
individual groups with their own goals.
Trend Micro continues to track and analyze highly
targeted attacks, also known as “advanced persistent
threats (APTs).” We have, in fact, published two research
papers on the Luckycat1 and Lurid2 campaigns. This
research paper will delve into another prominent group of
attackers referred to as “IXESHE” (pronounced “i-sushi”),
based on one of the more common detection names
security companies use for the malware they utilize. This
campaign is notable for targeting East Asian governments,
electronics manufacturers, and a telecommunications
company.
The IXESHE campaign makes use of targeted emails with
malicious attachments to compromise victims’ systems.
The emails are often tailored for specific victims and
contain malicious attachments that are almost always
“weaponized” .PDF files with known exploits that drop
malware executables onto targeted systems. In addition,
the IXESHE attackers conducted two specific attacks that
leveraged zero-day exploits—one in 2009 and another in
2011.

The IXESHE attackers almost always make use of
compromised servers as command-and-control (C&C)
servers. In some cases, the compromised servers are
hosted on target organizations’ networks after successful
infiltration so the attackers can increase their control
of the victims’ infrastructure. Using this approach, the
attackers amassed at least 60 C&C servers over time.
This technique also allows the attackers to cover their
tracks, as having the C&C server in the victims’ corporate
networks means very little C&C traffic leaves them. The
attackers’ deliberate use of compromised machines and
dynamic Domain Name System (DNS) services allows
them to hide traces of their presence by confusing their
activities with data belonging to legitimate individuals.
Looking at threat intelligence derived from tracking APT
campaigns over time primarily based on the network
traffic generated by the malware used, we were able
to develop indicators of compromise for the IXESHE
campaign. The malware samples used in this campaign
were not very complicated by nature but do give the
attackers almost complete control over their targets’
compromised systems.

Victims and Targets
Most of the IP addresses of IXESHE’s victims are linked
to DSL networks, which made it difficult to determine
their identities. Careful research, however, allowed the
identification of some of the attackers’ victims:
• East Asian governments
• Taiwanese electronics manufacturers
• A telecommunications company
Campaign victims were identified by using Whois records
and open source research. Trend Micro generally notifies
customers that are believed to have been specifically
targeted by APT campaigns.

Context
The IXESHE attackers have been actively launching highly
targeted attacks since at least July 2009.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Attack Vectors

Initial Delivery Method

Available data on the IXESHE campaign indicates that
targeted emails with malicious .PDF file attachments were
the attackers’ vector of choice. In most cases, the attacks
involved Adobe Acrobat, Reader, and Flash Player exploits
such as:

Every IXESHE case we examined revealed that the original
infection vector was a targeted email with a PDF exploit as
attachment. Older versions also used an XLS exploit.

•
•
•
•

CVE-2009-43243
CVE-2009-09274
CVE-2011-06095
CVE-2011-06116

It should also be noted that this campaign used CVE-200943247 and CVE-2011-06098 exploits when these were still
unpatched or considered zero-day vulnerabilities.
The IXESHE attackers also used an exploit that affected
Microsoft Excel—CVE-2009-3129.9

Operations
The IXESHE malware binary allowed the attackers to
easily take over and maintain complete control of victims’
systems to do the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

List all services, processes, and drives
Terminate processes and services
Download and upload files
Start processes and services
Get victims’ user names
Get a machine’s name and domain name
Download and execute arbitrary files
Cause a system to pause or sleep for a specified
number of minutes
• Spawn a remote shell
• List all current files and directories

Opening the .PDF file drops and executes a malware in a
victim’s system. The malware displays a blank .PDF file or a
decoy document related to the targeted attack. The emails
normally come from compromised personal accounts or
are entirely spoofed. Emails from spoofed senders were
usually sent via mail servers in the United States and
China.

Malware Local System Effects
Once dropped onto target systems by means of a
document exploit attached to a tailored email, the malware
drops an executable file into one of the following folders:
• %APPDATA%\Locations\
• %APPDATA%\Adobe
• %TEMP%
The malware also sets the executable file’s attributes
to “Hidden.” Some of the file names the attackers used
include:
•
•
•
•

winhlps.exe
acrotry.exe
AcroRd32.exe
Updater.exe

In order for the malware to survive rebooting, it normally
creates the following registry run key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
CurrentVersion\Run

The registry run key, in turn, points to the malware that
has been dropped. The value name of this entry varies
from sample to sample. Some of the names the attackers
used for it include:
• Adobe Assistant
• Migrated

Some samples, however, do not use a registry run key as
load point. Some of the more recent samples we observed
create a shortcut (i.e., .LNK file) in the Startup folder with
names such as adobe reader speed launch.lnk.
The malware also checks a system’s proxy settings for
later use in C&C communications:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
ProxyEnable
ProxyServer

C&C Communications
Upon installation, the malware starts communicating
with one of its C&C servers. Most of the samples
appeared to have at least three C&C servers hard coded
for redundancy. The C&C communications are easy to
identify, as these tended to be coded in the following
predetermined format:
http://[C&C Server]/[ACD] [EW]S[Some Numbers].
jsp?[Encrypted Base64 Blob]

Some samples alternatively use an FGKD.jsp or an FPK.jsp
file.
The Base64 blob is of particular interest. It makes use of a
custom Base64 alphabet. Once decoded, this blob reveals
a standardized structure of the information sent to the
registered C&C server, which includes the following details:
•
•
•
•

Computer name
Local IP address
Proxy server IP and port
Malware ID

To date, we have seen several custom Base64 alphabets,
including:
• +NO5RZaGHviIjhYq8b4ndQ=p012ySTcCDrs/xPgUz67F
M3wemKfkJLBo9VtWXlEuA
• HZa4vjIiGndQ=p012y+NO5RST/xPgUz67FMhYq8b3we

mKckJLBofCDrs9VtWXlEu
Some similarities exist across different versions of the
Base64 alphabet, which indicates that these are most
likely not completely randomly generated. Instead, the
attackers manually cut and pasted older versions after
altering some parts.
The malware ID seems to be a campaign code with a
different IP address for each attack. Some of the campaign
codes we have seen include:

It appears that the numbers in the given campaign codes
refer to dates when the campaigns were launched in
“MMDD” format. The letters are possibly related to the
target industry or company.
PAGE 3 | IXESHE

If the malware does not get a response from the C&C
server, it will choose another random number after the
AWS part of the URL and try again.
Once connected, the malware specifically waits for the
remote server to issue the following commands, which
may vary from one version to another:
• del [parameter]: Allows a remote user to delete files.
• disk [parameter]: Lists all available drives.
• dos [parameter]: Allows a remote user to execute
commands via cmd.exe.
• get [parameter]: Allows a remote user to download a
file from the remote server onto a local machine.
• list [parameter]: Lists files on the victim’s machine.
• ls [parameter]: Allows a remote user to display the
contents of a directory.
• kill [parameter]: Allows a remote user to terminate
processes.
• put [parameter]: Allows a remote user to upload a file
from a local machine to a remote server.
• rsh [parameter]: Similar to the sh or dos [parameter]
except for the fact that this is an already-existing file
or shell.
• run [parameter]: Allows a remote user to execute
programs.
• sh [parameter]: Allows a remote user to execute
commands via cmd.exe.
• sleep [parameter]: Causes a system to sleep for a
certain amount of time.

Related AES Campaign
We have also been tracking another campaign, which
we refer to as the “AES campaign,” which appears to be
related to IXESHE. The main body of the malware related
to the IXESHE campaign can be identified by its connection
to a C&C server using a file such as AWS12345.jsp and a
custom Base64 blob; the malware associated with the
AES campaign operates very similarly. The samples used
in the AES campaign slightly differed in terms of C&C
communication but had significant similarities with IXESHE
malware, which used the format:
http://[C&C Server]/[ACD] ES[Some Numbers].jsp

Even though the network traffic format of the AES
campaign was slightly similar, instead of the more familiar
AWS[random].jsp format, it used several other formats for
certain commands or events such as:
• AES: Initial beacon.
• DES: Send the path of %systemdir%.
• PES: Send the result of the “put” command.
• SEU: Send the “error” or “invalid” command.
• SUS: Send the system name, which is not encoded,
upon receiving the “exit” command.
• ZES: Send the result of the “dos” command.
Another difference in the traffic is that AWS uses the POST
method with the format, “http://[C&C Server]/FPK [Some
Numbers].jsp?[Base64 Blob],” when the “get” command is
invoked. The Base64 blob contains the file specified in the
“get” command.
Analysis of the binaries also revealed similarities between
the AES and AWS samples. These included the encoding
algorithm and commands used. Even though some
commands varied, the format and parameters used
essentially remained the same.

C&C INFRASTRUCTURE
The majority of the IXESHE campaign’s C&C servers were based in Taiwan and the United States.

Figure 1. Breakdown of C&C servers by country

PAGE 5 | IXESHE

This is, however, not an indicator of attribution. It is not
possible to determine where the attackers are based solely
on where their C&C infrastructures are located. In addition,
not all of the C&C servers are currently active. Many, if
not all of them, appear to be compromised machines. In
fact, at least 11 of the C&C servers were hosted on the
compromised machines of an East Asian government,
which made these very useful for launching targeted
attacks against it.
Most of the malware samples directly accessed an IP
address as a C&C server. Connections to domains did
exist in some cases. The domains were usually registered
using free dynamic DNS service providers or compromised
websites.
Overall, this strategy was part of the attackers’ modus
operandi. By choosing compromised machines to act as
C&C servers, fewer clues were left for investigators to
follow in an attempt to find out who is behind the attacks
compared with those using bulletproof hosting services
and registered domain names. To conduct research on
these servers, investigators need to differentiate between
information related to malicious and legitimate use.

This indicated that the front-end servers actually
functioned as proxy servers and that the true C&C servers
were hidden behind this initial group of C&C servers.
This made the network more resistant to takedown and
analysis. Due to a server error, however, the attackers
revealed the location of one of their back-end servers. We
discovered that the IP address, xx.xx.x2.202, is located in
Guangdong, China.
The particular error returned looked very similar to errors
generated by a tool called “HTran.”10 HTran stands for
“HUC Packet Transmit Tool,” a connection bouncer that
redirects TCP traffic destined for one host to an alternate
host, keeping the real host hidden from view. “HUC,” in
this case, stands for the hacking group, “Honker Union
of China.” It was coded by a hacker who goes by the
handle “lion.” This tool’s error-checking code, however, is
flawed. Assuming that everything properly works, the tool
functions very well as a proxy server but if the real server
is currently inaccessible, HTran will send an error message,
revealing its whereabouts.
Running a port scan on this server revealed some open
ports shown in the table below.

Real C&C Location
One very interesting error revealed more insights into
the C&C network’s setup. One of the malware samples we
tested was designed to access xxx.xxawan.com via port
443, which, at that time, resolved to xx.xxx.114.87:443, a
server located in the United States. The sample, however,
received the following error message from the server:
[SERVER]connection to xx.xx.x2.202:56413 error

Port

State

Service

80/tcp

Open

HTTP

8080/tcp

Open

HTTP Alternative

Based on OS fingerprinting, the server appears to be
running Windows 7 Enterprise Server. With only a few
open ports, however, it was very difficult to confirm this. In
addition, we did not receive a response when we tried to
connect to these ports.

ATTRIBUTION AND UNIQUE
FINGERPRINTS
Previous research on the IXESHE campaign indicated
several connections to groups possibly from China. In
addition, the IP address hiding behind the HTran instance
was an IP range assigned to China.
Upon further investigation of the “manufact” campaign,
however, it appears that the gang behind it may be English
speakers. The name of the campaign, for one, is most likely
a shortened form of “manufacturing.” The OS the C&C
server uses is also an English install of Microsoft XP. It is
also likely, of course, that the C&C server is a compromised
machine so it does not use the attackers’ first language.
The malware samples, which appear to have been
developed using C++, had a number of strings and error
codes in English such as “Enter command” and “Receive
command error!”
The date format used in the campaign codes (i.e., MMDD)
also provided us a clue as to where the attackers may be
from. This date format is only commonly used in China,
Korea, Iran, Japan, Hungary, Lithuania, and the United
States.

Unique Fingerprints and Modus Operandi
An attack can be considered associated with the gang
behind the IXESHE campaign if it exhibits the following
characteristics:
• Uses a specially crafted targeted email with a
malicious file attachment
• Uses document exploits, primarily .PDF files, to drop
malware into target systems
• Uses malware detected by security vendors as IXESHE
variants
• Uses a malware that sends a GET request to the C&C
server in the following format:
http://[C&C Server]/[ACD] [EW]S[Some
Numbers].jsp?[Encrypted Base64 Blob]

• Uses dynamic DNS services for or compromised
machines as C&C servers

Based on the limited amount of information we gathered
about the attackers, it was very difficult to pinpoint their
exact location.

TIMELINE
This section lists known incidents exhibiting the same
threat actor behaviors and so may be from the same
group behind IXESHE dating to as far back as July
2009. With the exception of the samples described in
ContagioDump, the dates for other samples refer to when
the respective sandboxes saw them for the first time. As
such, these dates should be considered “at least by” and
not the actual date of the attack.

CONCLUSION

DEFENDING AGAINST APTS

The IXESHE campaign has been successfully executing
targeted attacks since 2009. The attackers primarily
use malicious .PDF files that exploit vulnerabilities in
Adobe Reader, Acrobat, and Flash Player, including the
use of two zero-day exploits—one in 2009 and another
in 2011. While the attackers primarily targeted East
Asian governments in the past, they have also started
targeting a telecommunications company and electronics
manufacturers. They kept track of their targeted attacks
by embedding a “campaign tag” in the malware that
appears to describe when each attack was launched and,
in some cases, the nature of its target. We found more
than 40 of these campaign tags.

Sufficiently motivated threat actors can penetrate
even networks that use moderately advanced security
measures. As such, apart from standard and relevant
attack prevention measures and mechanisms such as
solid patch management; endpoint and network security;
firewall use; and the like, enterprises should also focus
on detecting and mitigating attacks. Moreover, data
loss prevention (DLP) strategies that identify the data
an organization is protecting and take into account the
context of data use should be employed.

The IXESHE attackers are notable for their use of
compromised machines within a target’s internal network
as C&C servers. This helped disguise their activities. In
addition, the attackers’ use of the proxy tool, HTran, also
helped mask their true location. While their identities
remain unknown, the attackers behind the IXESHE
campaign demonstrated that they were both determined
and capable. While the malware used in the attacks
were not very complicated by nature, these proved very
effective. This campaign remains an active threat.

Threat intelligence refers to indicators that can be used
to identify the tools, tactics, and procedures threat actors
engaging in targeted attacks utilize. Both external and
local threat intelligence is crucial for developing the
ability to detect attacks early. The following are the core
components of this defense strategy:

Local and External Threat Intelligence

• Enhanced visibility: Logs from endpoint, server,
and network monitoring are an important and often
underused resource that can be aggregated to provide
a view of the activities within an organization that
can be processed for anomalous behaviors that can
indicate a targeted attack.
• Integrity checks: In order to maintain persistence,
malware will make modifications to the file system and
registry. Monitoring such changes can indicate the
presence of malware.
• Empowering the human analyst: Humans are best
positioned to identify anomalous behaviors when
presented with a view of aggregated logs from across
a network. This information is used in conjunction with
custom alerts based on the local and external threat
intelligence available.
Technologies available today such as Deep Discovery
provide visibility, insight, and control over networks to
defend against targeted threats.11 Deep Discovery uniquely
detects and identifies evasive threats in real time and
provides in-depth analysis and actionable intelligence to
prevent, discover, and reduce risks.

Mitigation and Cleanup Strategy

Data-Centric Protection Strategy

Once an attack is identified, the cleanup strategy should
focus on the following objectives:

The ultimate objective of targeted attacks is to acquire
sensitive data. As such, DLP strategies that focus on
identifying and protecting confidential information are
critical. Enhanced data protection and visibility across
an enterprise provides the ability to control access to
sensitive data as well as monitor and log successful and
unsuccessful attempts to access it. Enhanced access
control and logging capabilities allow security analysts to
locate and investigate anomalies, respond to incidents, and
initiate remediation strategies and damage assessment.

• Determine the attack vector and cut off
communications with the C&C server.
• Determine the scope of the compromise.
• Assess the damage by analyzing the data and forensic
artifacts available on compromised machines.
Remediation should be applied soon afterward, which
includes steps to fortify affected servers, machines, or
devices into secure states, informed in part by how the
compromised machines were infiltrated.

Educating Employees Against Social
Engineering
Security-related policies and procedures combined with
education and training programs are essential components
of defense. Traditional training methods can be fortified
by simulations and exercises using real spear-phishing
attempts sent to test employees. Employees trained to
expect targeted attacks are better positioned to report
potential threats and constitute an important source of
threat intelligence.

May 2012 | APT Campaign Quick Profile: IXESHE
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) refer to a category of threats that aggressively pursue and compromise specific
targets to maintain persistent presence within the victim’s network so they can move laterally and exfiltrate data.
Unlike indiscriminate cybercrime attacks, spam, web threats, and the like, APTs are much harder to detect because
of the targeted nature of related components and techniques. Also, while cybercrime focuses on stealing credit card
and banking information to gain profit, APTs are better thought of as cyber espionage.

IXESHE
• First Seen
Individual targeted attacks are not one-off attempts. Attackers continually try to get inside the target’s network.
The IXESHE campaign has been actively staging targeted attacks since at least July of 2009.

• Victims and Targets
APT campaigns target specific industries or communities of interest in specific regions.
IXESHE has been found to target electronics manufacturers, a telecommunications company, and East Asian governments.

• Operations
First-stage computer intrusions often use social engineering. Attackers custom-fit attacks to their targets.
IXESHE attacks used custom-fit targeted emails with PDF exploits for CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2009-0927, CVE-2011-0609, and CVE-2011-0611. These
were used to drop malicious executable files that gave the attackers complete control of their targets’ systems.
The attackers used either dynamic Domain Name System (DNS) or compromised servers hosted on networks that they previously successfully
infiltrated.

• Possible Indicators of Compromise
Attackers want to remain undetected as long as possible. A key characteristic of these attacks is stealth.
»» Enters networks via a specially crafted, targeted email with a malicious file attachment
