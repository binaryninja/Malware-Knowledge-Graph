The State of Industrial
Cybersecurity 2018
Wolfgang Schwab, Principal Consultant
Mathieu Poujol, Head of Cybersecurity
June 2018

INTRODUCTION – INDUSTRIAL CYBERSECURITY
As connectivity to the outside world grows, security is becoming one of the m ost im portant topics
in i ndustrial I T and Operational Technology ( OT), i.e. the hardware and software used in the
production area. I ndustrial cybersecurity developed into a board-level topic during 2017.
But what do user com panies really want? What are the ir priorities, and what concerns and
challenges do they face? What external and internal factors are im pacting industrial
cybersecurity? What strategies and m easures are being em ployed, now and in the future?
The present trend study " The State of I ndustrial Cybersecurity 2018" seeks to answer all these
questions. It was carried out by P AC on behalf of Kaspersky Lab and analyzes the status quo and
future developm ents worldwide with regard to industrial cybersecurity. It is based on a C ATI
survey of 320 worldwide professionals with decision -m aking power on O T/ICS cybersecurity, as
well as 12 expert interviews . This study is an annual study. The first one was carried out in 2017.

“Cybersecurity is grabbing a lot of
attention at every level. But to deal with
this problem we must do more. Cyber
threats are a harsh reality of today’s
world, which we can’t keep on
ignoring. With most of the processes
being handled remotely, there is
always a chance of breach, of
someone getting ahold of these
processes and causing a lot of harm.”
(Steel manufacturing, US)

KEY FINDINGS – TAKE-AWAYS

•

Over three quarters of the companies surveyed state that OT/ICS cybersecurity is a major
priority
But if com panies really attribute such a high level of im portance to this topic, it would
be essential to carry out the associated m easures in a very stringent way. This seems not
to be the case in all com panies .

•

Over three quarters of the companies surveyed state that it is very likely or at least quite
likely to become a target of a cybersecurity attack in the OT/ICS space
Despite this, only 23% are com pliant with minim al m andatory industry or governm ent
guidance and reg ulations around cybersecurity of industrial control systems . On the
other hand, the vast m ajority of the com panies surveyed are increasing their OT/I CS
cybersecurity investm ents or keeping them at least steady.

•

More than half of the companies did not experience any incident or breach in the past
12 months
Although this seems to be a good thing at first glance , the question is whether or not
they would even have recognized it . Many com panies do not detect or even track
attacks! Moreover, since the com panies surveyed have only just started digital
transform ation, it can be said that the attack surface will increase along with the level
of digitalization.

•

For most companies that experienced OT/ICS cybersecurity incidents or breaches this
had a relevant negative impact on their bottom line
If incidents or breaches occur, they have a strong negative impact, usually regarding
the com pany’s bottom line; in the worst-case scenarios, the consequences could even
m ean casualties.

•

Low but increasing maturity
The m aturity of ICS/OT cybersecurity rem ains low, e.g. the way OT/I CS security is
organized, but the potential im pacts and liabilities m ake it a priority ; besides, the level
of m aturity is quickly rising, even if it is strongly limited by the lack of skills and
collaboration.

•

Collaboration between IT and OT teams is critical
Collaboration is a critical factor for cybersecurity, even m ore so in OT/ICS cybersecurity.
I T and OT people have different goals, processes, tools , and languages , but they m ust
collaborate if they want to protect the OT/ICS space that is m ore and m ore blended
with the I T space.

“Cybersecurity of ICS in our organization is critical,
and we take it very seriously. Ensuring best -quality
products is the top priority and undoubtedly a
fundamental concern. Any breach into our drug
manufacturing systems can lead to a wide range of
operational disruptions – including production
downtime – or may result in inefficient or poisonous
drugs, spillage of hazardous materials etc. There are
many compliance requirements we need to follow.”
(Pharmaceuticals, US)

CYBERSECURITY IN AN INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT:
MANAGING RISKS AND COMPLIANCE ARE KEY
As digital transform ation is spreading within the industrial environm ent, cybersecurity is becoming
m ore and m ore im portant across the board . This section will look at the business priorities, the
priorities of OT/I CS cybersecurity, OT/I CS cybersecurity business risks and concerns , and the
challenges that lie in m anagem ent of OT/I CS cybersecurity.

“Although it appears there are incremental improvements in several
areas of addressing OT cybersecurity risk, it is discouraging to see
that for the most part we still lack significant progress across the
board when it comes to dedicating resources to these challenges.
As we increase the level of automation in our critical infrastructures,
we MUST take security issues seriously.”
(Marty Edwards, Managing Director, Automation Federation, USA)

BUSINESS PRIORITIES
Basically, all surveyed business priorities have becom e even m ore pronounced at m ost companies ,
as we com pare the 2017 survey results with the 2018 ones. The m ost im portant ones are still the
m anagem ent of risks, im proving products/services quality , and better com pliance with regulations
and requirem ents . Especially custom er-related items have seen a growth in prioritization, unlike cost
reduction. I n 2018, com panies are not in defensive m ode anym ore; they want to grow, expand, and
profit from digital transform ation.

OT/ICS CYBERSECURITY BUSINESS RISKS AND CONCERNS
Looking at cybersecurity business risks and concerns in the OT/I CS space,

“ICS cybersecurity is
attributed a lot of
importance at all levels.
But I would agree that
there has been an
awareness issue at lower
levels because people
there are not so much
aware of the impact of a
breach or cyber-attack.”

we see that awareness levels have risen strongly. While in the 2017 survey,
about one third of com panies attributed concerns to the different items, in
2018 it i s about two thirds attributing m ajor concerns and alm ost one third
attributing minor concerns.
The top concerns are dam age to the products/services and injury or death
of em ployees . Most com panies also see a link between cyber dam age and
business success on different levels: an adverse effect on quality is directly
linked to the loss of customer confidence , while the loss of business sensitive
inform ation is associated with a loss of contracts or business opportunities.

(Energy and utility, US)

In addition, m ost com panies have concerns over a violation of regulations .

Which of the following aspects will be a major, minor, or no concern for your
company in case of an ICS cybersecurity incident/breach?

Major concern

("No concern" not shown)

We can see that awareness of many items has risen considerably. Most of the items are now seen
as a m ajor concern by the m ajority of com panies .
When com paring I T security and OT/ICS cybersecurity, a key aspect is that in the former dam age is
m ostly confined to the I T space, thus rem aining largely virtual, while in the OT/ICS space it could
also be physical. This has a totally different impact on risk mitigation and on the liabilities enterprises
could face.
To evaluate the actions needed in terms of cybersecurity in the OT/ICS space, it is not only im portant
to know the concerns and the associated potential dam age, but also the likelihood of an attack.

The answers given indicate a rising likelihood of com panies becoming a target of cyber-attacks in
the OT/I CS space: 32% of the com panies surveyed believe it very likely that they will be targeted,
an increase of 7% on last year.
When it com es to t he self-assessment of OT/I CS security risks , we see huge differences between the
various regions surveyed. While 35% of Russian com panies do not see them selves as targets and only
13% think it very likely that they will becom e a target, com panies from the Middle East are m uch
m ore alarm ed – there, 63% of com panies consider it very likely that they will becom e the target of
a cyber-attack. This attitude does not com e as a surprise since industrial com panies in the Middle
East have been victims of targeted ICS attacks in recent years , including the recent Triton case. This
can also be seen as an indicator of m arket maturity, which is pretty low in Russia at the m om ent.
Even in the area of OT/I CS cybersecurity, traditional cyber threats are a m ajor concern for the
m ajority of the com panies surveyed. 66% of the com panies state that targeted attacks and AP Ts
are a m ajor concern – this is understandable given that in 2017 there were new rum ors of cyberphysical attacks, including Triton and I ndustroyer. For c onventional m alware/virus outbreaks, this
figure is 65%, while for ransom ware attacks it is 64%. I n 2017, there were lots of ransomware
outbreaks, including cases inside industrial environm ents , which explains the high level of consensus
regarding these as m ajor concerns.

COMPLIANCE
ROLE OF COMPLIANCE AND REGULATIONS

often audited and investigated.
But only 23% of the com panies surveyed say they are com pliant with

regulations has seen a strong decline com pared to last year, for
which there are three reasons:
1.

Mandatory c ybersecurity regulations such as the NIS Directive are given priority, and as
they are expensive to im plement , they are eating up all the budget and tim e of the
com panies surveyed.

2.

In tim es of internal and external skills shortages , voluntary tasks are the first to be skipped.

3.

A lot of guidance and regulations evolve quickly and as such are difficult to follow in full ,
i.e. being com pliant in 2017 does not necessarily m ean being so in 2018 as well ; no resources
are available for additional actions .

With increasing connectivity of OT/I CS environm ents to I T systems and th e
outside world, conventi onal m alware and virus outbreaks are becom ing
m ore and m ore problem atic in the OT/I CS area , too. 64% of com panies
experienced this in the last 12 m onth, slightly m ore than a year ag o. The
sam e is true for ransomware (30% in 2018).
Targeted attacks and AP Ts are a decreasing challenge in the OT/ICS
space, m aybe due to a better understanding of what a real targeted
cyber-attack on the I CS dom ain is.
It is very interesting to com pare this question to the one on page 9 about
the m ost feared attacks, as we see important differences in perception
and between what is happening and what is being feared: AP T and data
leaks/spying are top fears – they rarely happen, but their potentially dire
im pact makes them very threatening.

“I don’t believe that any
external attack would do
great harm to our ICS, as
we have a strong
perimeter defense. On the
other hand, internal
“attacks” are always an
issue and a much bigger
problem than any
external threat. In fact,
our users are a great
danger to our ICS since
they’re not as careful as
they should be.”
(Metal processing, Russia)

FINANCIAL DAMAGE
Financial dam age is always a tricky topic as it is difficult to
m easure.
In total, 20% of the com panies surveyed experienced an increase
i n financial costs and dam age related to incidents . Com pared to
the years before, 48% recognized the sam e financial costs and
dam age while 27% stated decreasing costs. I n view of the
constant growth of cyber-attacks, even in the OT/I CS space, the
cybersecurity actions being taken are showing positive results at
least in som e com panies .

“Cost is one of the most
important challenges that
organizations face when it
comes to ICS
cybersecurity
implementation. I think
making a case for
investing money into ICS
is tough because there
are no direct profits to be
gained from doing so.”

When looking at the regions m ore closely, it is clear to see that

(Energy and utility, US)

there is quite a difference in the proportion of com panies stating
an increase in financial costs and d am age. While 31% of the
com panies surveyed in China and I ndia report higher costs and dam age, in Latin Am erica this figure
is only 13%. This is an indication that giving cybersecurity in the OT/ICS space a m ajor priority helps
to prevent incidents and limit the c osts and dam age associated with it.

IT TRENDS – THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND CLOUD COMPUTING
Som e I T trends and innovations associated with the current digital transform ation are not only
valid in the I T space, but also affect the OT/I CS area. Most lead to a higher degree of
connectivity to the outside world and by that increase operational security risks.
Industrial IoT

systems. The m ost relevant ones for OT/ICS are sm art energy and I ndustry 4.0, sm art

WHAT’S NEXT: STRATEGIES AND MEASURES
In order to m aster the OT/I CS cybersecurity challenges, com panies need to have a strategy, an
organization, and m easures in place. Obviously, th is organization and these m easures need to have
sufficient funding to work sm oothly.

INVESTMENTS
With a growing num ber of cyber -attacks and increasing risks, a huge m ajority of com panies are
increasing their OT/ICS cybersecurity investments or at least keeping the investments steady.
The influence that incidents or breaches have had on investm ent decisions is also showing a direct
connection. 52% of the com panies surveyed see incidents and breaches in the past as a m ajor
driver of future investm ents , while only 10% state that they are unim pressed by such events.
In the cybersecurity solution segm ent, we see a slightly different picture. While 35% of the com panies
surveyed expect investments to stay the sam e as in the previous year, 56% expect them to increase.

(ORGANIZATIONAL) APPROACHES AND STRATEGIES
Stakeholders
From an organizational point of view , there are different possible
approac hes to organizing OT/ICS cybersecurity. The m ajor
vectors are:
•

the focus on OT/ICS

•

production intensity

•

outsourcing culture.

“As a middleman, I need to
report to the IT, ICS, and
specifically the
cybersecurity department,
which is included in our
internal IT.”
(Metal processing, Russia)

The survey clearly highlights a trend that ICS organizations tend to keep m anagem ent of their OT/I CS
cybersecurity internall y, with only 8% of the com panies fully outsourcing this function currently.
Com panies loathe to outsource the cybersecurity of those core parts of their value chain, and
furtherm ore, there are still too few outsourcing providers that are capable of assuming this type of
workload.

“There are a lot of threats in the industry today; every
few months we hear about instances of hacking,
data theft, or a cyber-attack on some plant. This
topic should be prioritized at management level and
all other levels informed accordingly.”

OT/ICS CYBERSECURITY MEASURES
Last but not least, it is im portant to take a closer look at the
different OT/I CS cybersecurity m easures that are im plemented,
planned for the next 12 m onths , or still in discussion.
Technology-oriented measures
For m ost of the technology-oriented m easures, it can be said that
what was planned in 2017 has not been realized accordingly.
Anti -m alware and antivirus are standard solutions (im plem ented
by 97% of the com panies surveyed), as well as application
protection (91%).
Other technology-oriented m easures are still not im plemented at
all com panies. Even though these technologies are a given in
traditional I T cybersecurity, in OT/ICS cybersecurity they are less
often in use.

“We mainly focus on
perimeter security. No
vulnerability management
involved. We will continue
to focus on network
protection in most cases.”
(Metal processing, Russia)

“It is important to
implement an air gap
security measure as it
ensures that the data is
going from one side and
restricts the other parties
in use of the data.”
(Oil and gas industry, UAE)

For exam ple, network m onitoring and log analysis – a given in
traditional I T security – is im plemented for OT/ICS purposes at only 56% of the com panies surveyed.
The sam e is true for network segm entation (47% of com panies) or intrusion detection (45%). These
points are the foundation of any viable OT/ICS protection. Air gapping is a m ust-have. The basic
idea is that there is no connection between OT/I CS networks and the traditional I T networks or the
Internet. 34% of the com panies surveyed state that they have im plemented air gap ping; 39% are
planning im plementation within the next 12 months. The low level of m aturity is worrying.
In addition, the m ajority of com panies are im plementing IoT and I ndustry 4.0. However, a
connection to the OT/I CS systems is needed for these technologies to be effective .
Vulnerability scanning
Vulnerability scanning is a fundam ental task to m ake sure systems and applications are up to date
and known problem s are fixed. Obviously, vulnerability scans should be continuously perform ed or
at least be done with every vulnerability database update. Another exam ple of the lack of m aturity
in OT/ICS cybersecurity is that m ost of such scans are targeted only at traditional I T components
(like OS for SC AD A), not for specific ICS com ponents.
Most of the respondents using vulnerability scanning use it regularly, i.e. every week (46%) or every
2 weeks (26%). The rem aining 28% did not understand the concept.
Process-oriented measures
Security awareness training for staff, contractors , and vendors wit h access to control systems and
networks are widely implem ented (82% of the com panies surveyed). Security assessments and audits
of control systems and their networks, including penetration tests, are also im portant but less often
im plemented. Only 60% of com panies have such assessm ents and audits im plem ented, but at least
35% of the com panies surv eyed are planning to im plem ent such m easures in the next 12 m onths. As
in m ost I T segm ents, training and certifications for current staff responsible for im plementing or
m aintaining the security of control systems and networks are im plemented at only 46% o f the
com panies surveyed; 40% of com panies plan to do so in the next 12 m onths.
