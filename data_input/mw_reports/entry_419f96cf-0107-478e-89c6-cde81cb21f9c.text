January 7, 2020 • Insikt Group®

Recorded Future’s Insikt Group® reviewed available information to analyze the likelihood of
Iranian response to the killing of Qassem Suleimani. This report serves to provide a compilation
of likely tactics, tools, and groups involved in a cyber-based retaliation.
This report will be of greatest interest to organizations concerned with being targeted by an
Iranian state-sponsored group, especially in the wake of heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf,
as well as those following Middle Eastern geopolitical events.
Insikt Group will provide updates as new ﬁndings surface surrounding these incidents or cyber
threat activities related to them are detected. See these links for additional background on how
Iran manages state-directed cyber operations and on the history of some state-sponsored and
patriotic hackers. Sources include intelligence surfaced in the Recorded Future® Platform and
other open sources.

Executive Summary
In the early hours of January 3, Iran’s Qassem Suleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps – Quds Force (IRGC-QF), Iraq’s Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the
Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), and several others were killed in a U.S. missile strike near
Iraq’s Baghdad International Airport. We assess that the deaths of Suleimani and al-Muhandis in
particular are highly likely to provoke a response from Iran and its allies, which could include a
pattern of retaliatory asymmetric measures executed by Iranian military assets and their allied
militias against U.S. and partner government and business interests regionally, in the Middle East.

Key Judgments
We anticipate a measured but direct response from Iran. We assess this is in part to help
insulate the Iranian ruling regime, which is deeply concerned with remaining in power and
hesitant to engage the U.S. in a direct military confrontation. Despite our expectation for a
measured response from the ruling regime, we believe that Iranian proxies will likely
retaliate more aggressively in the region.

Iranian Cyber Response to Death of IRGC Head Would Likely Use Reported TTPs and Previous Access

Iran possesses highly capable cyber operational forces, and we believe the most likely
targets of cyberattacks remain the United States and partner government, military, and
commercial interests within the Middle East.
Based on our observations of chatter among hacktivist forces (which we deﬁne as proregime but not government directed), we assess that attacks are likely to escalate against
softer targets, such as loosely protected websites, servers, and databases.
Recent documented instances of Russian state-sponsored groups hijacking and utilizing
Iranian infrastructure for cyber operations could cause increased uncertainty and confusion
for victims attempting to attribute cyber activities. It is less clear today whether operations
using known and tracked Iranian cyber infrastructure are actually being run and directed by
the Iranian government. This raises the potential for misattribution and mistaken escalation
because we do not know the extent to which Russia has compromised Iranian cyber
operational infrastructure.

Background
Late in the evening on January 2, 2020 ET, press reporting revealed that a U.S. missile strike had
occurred near Iraq’s Baghdad International Airport. The airstrike killed several people, including
Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – Quds Force (IRGCQF), and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of an Iraqi militia called the Popular
Mobilization Forces (PMF). Among those reportedly killed were several other representatives
from the PMF, including Mohammed Ridha Jabri, the group’s public relations chief. A statement
from the U.S. Department of Defense, as well as press reports from Iranian government outlets,
conﬁrmed the strike and that Suleimani was the target of the attack.

Threat Analysis
Insikt Group assesses that the death of Suleimani in particular will likely provoke a response from
the Iranian government, including multiple scenarios involving retaliatory asymmetric measures
executed by Iranian military assets, proxies, or their allied militias against U.S. government and
business interests in the Middle East, as well as U.S. regional partners, such as Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Israel.
As of this writing, Recorded Future has observed a unanimous response by Iranian military,
diplomatic, and political leaders that a retaliatory attack will take place, although such statements
did not include any speciﬁcs as to when, how, and where a response will occur. Iran’s Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei declared on January 3, 2020, that a “harsh revenge” awaited those who led
the strike against Suleimani and initiated three days of national mourning to commemorate the
fallen IRGC-QF Commander. On January 5, the military advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Major
General Hossein Dehghan, stated that Iran’s response would “for sure be military” and directed
against U.S. “military sites.”

Reading the Need to Retaliate
Over the past few years, General Soleimani has reportedly enjoyed widespread domestic
support, due in part to the notion that he was responsible for the strategies that shielded the
country from terrorist attacks and threats posed by the Islamic State (IS) group. Several reports

Iranian Cyber Response to Death of IRGC Head Would Likely Use Reported TTPs and Previous Access

have suggested that Soleimani’s death has led to a distinct call for retaliation, which is uncommon
in recent Iranian military history, except in cases where extreme acts of violence have impacted
government or Iranian military personnel. Examples of this include the June 2017 IS attack
against the Iranian parliament, and the August 2017 beheading of an IRGC ofﬁcer, Mohsen
Hojaji, by IS. The former led to a ballistic missile attack against IS, while the IRGC ofﬁcer Hojaji
became a symbol in the ﬁght against IS. At the time, Soleimani, among many senior IRGC
ofﬁcials, spearheaded the response to Hojaji’s death.
One historic example which we believe depicts the more calculated approach that Iran is likely to
pursue in response to Soleimani’s death was the slaying of Iranian diplomats by the Afghan
Taliban in 1998. In 1998, almost a dozen Iranian diplomats were killed by the Afghan Taliban, an
incident that resulted in a popular outcry against the Taliban group and the mobilization of
approximately 200,000 Iranian military forces. Research from the RAND Corporation depicted a
pragmatic decision-making process within the Iranian government to deal with its Afghan crisis.
Notwithstanding hardline interests from the IRGC and radical political fronts to engage militarily
against their ideological nemesis, Supreme Leader Khamenei instead opted for a response
“without the risk of war.” Similarly, on January 5, 2020, IRGC general Hossein Dehgan, a top
adviser to Khamenei, claimed that Iran would respond militarily to the killing of Soleimani, but
would not seek war.
Insikt Group assesses that Iran is likely to pursue a measured asymmetric response, as it
balances the need to offset the pressure of Soleimani’s death without further fueling the potential
for direct military engagement with the U.S.

Examples of Recent Asymmetric Retaliatory Attacks
Previous suspected retaliatory measures taken by Iran or Iranian-backed forces in the past
include but are not limited to:
Throughout 2019, the IRGC-QF was suspected of being behind the missile strike of Saudi
Arabia’s oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, as well as the seizure and commandeering of
the Swedish-owned oil tanker Stena Impero.
Iran has been accused of using its inﬂuence with Shia groups to incite rebellion in locations
known to be fertile grounds for sectarian and anti-government activity, such as Bahrain.
This kind of inﬂuence likely motivated the violent protests held at the U.S. embassy in Iraq
between December 31, 2019 and January 2, 2020. Reports suggest that these protests
were executed by supporters of Kata’ib Hizballah, an Iranian-backed proxy force led by alMuhandis.
Iran has also been accused of supporting acts of sabotage against regional oil and gas
infrastructure. Throughout 2019, reports have linked Iran to coordinated attacks with
Yemeni allies, the Houthi rebels (Ansar Allah), to against Saudi Arabia’s oil and gas
infrastructure. In Bahrain, Iran purportedly supports a slew of Shia militia groups, and was
allegedly linked to a high-proﬁle attack on Bahraini oil and gas infrastructure in November
2017.
Iran has a number of highly capable computer network operations teams that may be involved in
a response against the United States, regional partners, and Western interests. Recorded Future
believes that previous accesses gained from espionage operations will very likely facilitate these

retaliatory actions. Most notably, Iranian teams have used a destructive cyber capability in prior
escalations, which we assess demonstrates both a willingness and ability to deploy such malware
in similar situations. Iranian actors are also known to favor web shells, password spraying, and a
combination of custom and commodity malware to gain access to target environments. Despite
the use of destructive malware in previous cyber response scenarios, the death of General
Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike is a unique situation and injects signiﬁcant uncertainty into our
assessments regarding which cyber capabilities Iran will likely leverage against which regional
U.S. and partner interests.
In June 2019, Recorded Future observed APT33 malware activity targeting U.S. industry, critical
infrastructure, and government entities. Rapidly following this, on June 22, U.S. President Donald
Trump stated that the administration used cyber strikes against Iran’s missile systems amid
heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf. Iran was also accused of placing limpet mines on a
Japanese oil tanker in the Gulf, which fueled tension in the region. At that time, in June 2019, the
U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency reported an increase in Iran-related actors
deploying wiper malware to their targets; however, the NSA’s Threat Operations Center technical
director stated that Iranian actors were continuing normal intelligence-gathering operations
focused on espionage, not destruction.

Previous Access and Tools May Tip Cyber Response
Recorded Future anticipates continued targeting of U.S. industry, critical infrastructure, and
government entities by Iranian threat actors during this period of heightened tension. Although we
assess that Iranian actors will continue to target domestic U.S. government, military, and
commercial entities for cyberespionage purposes, organizations in the Persian Gulf region are at
the greatest risk for destructive cyberattacks. Further, we judge that Iranian actors APT33, APT34
(also known as OilRig), or MUDDYWATER will also likely target United States allies and partners
in the Middle East in cyberespionage operations. We anticipate the continued mixture of custom
and commodity tooling, and recommend that organizations monitor for suspicious Powershell and
WMIC-based behavior in particular.
MUDDYWATER actors have used politically ﬂavored spearﬁshing and macros, or stolen
credentials, to drop malware and steal information. MUDDYWATER relies heavily on a
Powershell-based backdoor called POWERSTATS. MUDDYWATER makes use of
compromised third-party domains that are used as proxies to distribute POWERSTATS,
and for command and control (C2) purposes.
APT33 is one of the most active groups currently operating in the Middle East and has
demonstrated an ability to continually revise its tactics and pursue a variety of tools and
techniques to compromise its victims. The actor uses a wide range of tools in its custom
malware toolkit, including POWERTON, while also relying heavily on open source remote
access trojans (RATs), including njRAT, Powershell Empire, Nanocore, and PupyRAT.

APT39 has primarily leveraged the Chafer and Remexi trojan families, targeting those in
the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and
supporting IT ﬁrms. We assess that the group’s primary focus on telecommunications and
travel indicates an interest in both monitoring speciﬁc individuals and collecting proprietary
or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements
related to national priorities. Researchers from FireEye have noted that APT39 operations
are similar to that of APT34 (OilRig) in terms of Middle East targeting patterns,
infrastructure, and timing. More speciﬁcally, both APT39 and APT34 share the same
malware distribution methods, infrastructure nomenclature, and targeting overlaps.
The Lab Dookhtegan leaks showcased APT34’s custom tooling: PoisonFrog, Glimpse,
Hypershell, HighShell, Fox Panel, and Webmask. The PoisonFrog implant is a Powershellbased downloader that pulls down a VBS backdoor. Assessments from Chronicle and Palo
Alto show that PoisonFrog is the BONDUPDATER backdoor, previously analyzed by
FireEye, Booz Allen, and Palo Alto’s Unit 42. Webmask is likely part of the DNSpionage
DNS hijacking campaign disclosed by Cisco Talos.
We assess that previous credential-gathering activities conducted by APT33, APT34, and APT35
may be used to gain initial access to targeted environments. Notable recent events include:
In October 2019, APT33 reportedly took special interest in industrial control system (ICS)
hardware and software vendors in the United States and worldwide, conducting a focused
password-spraying campaign against those organizations. The actors typically targeted
between 50,000 to 70,000 organizations at a time, selecting a small number of credentials
to attempt to gain access to each organization. The breadth of this targeting was curtailed
signiﬁcantly between October and November 2019, when APT33 purportedly targeted only
around 2,000 organizations per month, attempting to use various password combinations
on 18 to 20 accounts in each organization, a 900% increase. Commands used in
password-spraying and on-host activity can be found in this GitHub.
Similarly, FireEye also found APT34 using the credential-stealing malware families
LONGWATCH, VALUEVAULT, and TONEDEAF in a targeted spearphishing campaign.
These malware families largely sought to harvest credentials from targeted individuals. The
actors used LinkedIn messages with malicious links to entice the victims to download a
legitimate datasheet that used VBA macros to download the malware families.
Data gathered from APT35 (Newscaster, PHOSPHORUS) credential harvesting via
watering hole attacks, phishing emails, and fake social media proﬁles may also be
leveraged. On October 4, 2019, Microsoft disclosed that, for 30 days from August to
September 2019, APT35 was observed making 2,700 attempts to breach a U.S.
presidential campaign, later identiﬁed as the Trump campaign, in addition to targeting
current and former U.S. government ofﬁcials, political journalists, and “prominent” Iranian
expatriates. The group targeted 241 email accounts, and was successful in compromising
four accounts that were not associated with U.S. government ofﬁcials or the campaign.
Previous access or information gleaned from DNS hijacking activity from SeaTurtle, and the
DNSpionage/APT34 cluster may also facilitate further intelligence-gathering.

Destructive Malware

Iranian Cyber Response to Death of IRGC Head Would Likely Use Reported TTPs and Previous Access

APT33 and APT34 have been linked to destructive malware attacks against the oil and gas
sector, using Shamoon, DEADWOOD, and ZeroCleare.
During a presentation at the CYBERWARCON conference in Arlington, VA in late 2019,
Microsoft analysts discussed APT33 dropping a destructive malware family called
DEADWOOD onto a VPN server in Saudi Arabia in June 2019. Recorded Future cannot
provide insight into the malware family described by Microsoft. However, on June 22, 2019,
a ﬁle uploaded to VirusTotal was ﬂagged as being a wiper; it was later ﬂagged by the user
“THOR scanner” as a wiper used in the Middle East. It is likely that this ﬁle
(857ef30bf15ea3da9b94092da78ef0fc) is the wiper in question.
In 2012, APT33 deployed the destructive malware Shamoon, and is suspected along with
other Iran-nexus APT groups to have participated in the December 2018 operation against
Italian petrochemical contractor SAIPEM.
In early December 2019, IBM’s X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS)
published their discovery of the ZeroCleare wiper malware that was observed targeting
energy and industrial sectors in the Middle East. According to IBM IRIS, APT34 (OilRig)
was likely involved with ZeroCleare’s deployment. During their discovery efforts, IBM IRIS
researchers found that ZeroCleare shared characteristics with the Shamoon malware,
speciﬁcally in that the ZeroCleare malware overwrites the master boot record (MBR) as well
as the disk partitions on Windows machines.
Analysis of a recent sample that called itself “Dustman” revealed similarities to ZeroCleare
and contained anti-Saudi messaging, making use of the same raw disk driver; however, the
sample had all of the tooling needed bundled into a single executable. The sample
contained anti-Saudi messaging, and dropped an anti-Saudi mutex (“Down With Bin
Salman”).

Nationalistic and Pro-Regime Hacktivism
We assess that the Iranian regime will likely take its time contemplating a response to the killing
of General Suleimani. In stark contrast, pro-regime (but not government-directed) cyber actors will
likely continue to conduct disruptive activity. Recorded Future is aware of hacktivist defacement
activity occurring within hours of the news breaking of Suleimani’s death, including against U.S.
government institutions. Further, we also observed the distribution of disinformation among IRGC
supporters. Based on our observations of chatter among hacktivist forces, we assess that attacks
are likely to escalate against softer targets, such as loosely protected websites, servers, and
databases.
It is not outside the realm of possibility for actors to deploy SamSam ransomware or similar
campaigns under the guise of criminal activity. While there is no evidence to suggest that the two
actors were afﬁliated with the Iranian government, Tehran is undoubtedly aware of those
operations and their tools.

Outlook
We assess that Iran may exercise a response to the killing of General Qassem Suleimani that will
more aggressively rely on cyberattacks rather than kinetic ones, which will likely take the form of
espionage or sabotage.

This cyber response — likely one of several potential asymmetric countermeasures — may be
carried out directly by Iranian intelligence or military groups, by their contractors, or by other
proxies. These measures will very likely be fueled by previous accesses and information gained
from espionage operations. Attributing these intrusions and distinguishing them from other
opportunistic intrusions will likely prove difﬁcult.
Further, the recent documented instances of Russian state-sponsored groups hijacking and
utilizing Iranian infrastructure for cyber operations have injected further uncertainty into tracking
and attributing Iranian espionage or destructive activities. We assess that this infrastructure
hijacking and increased uncertainty raises the potential that an incident could be misattributed
and mistakenly be interpreted as an escalation. There are more sides with interests in the Middle
East than just the U.S. and its partners and Iran and its proxies; the injection of further uncertainty
via Russian operations masquerading as Iranian could contribute to an atmosphere of chaos or
confusion in the wake of a cyber intrusion. This raises the potential for misattribution and
mistaken escalation because we do not know the extent to which Russia has compromised
Iranian cyber operational infrastructure.

Suggested Mitigations
APT33 continues to favor dynamic DNS (DDNS) hosting; Recorded Future’s Weaponized
Domains Security Control Feed can be used to identify and block these domains.
Recorded Future proactively detects and logs malicious server conﬁgurations in the
Command and Control Security Control Feed.
Recorded Future recommends that organizations monitor for sequential login attempts from
the same IP against different accounts. This type of activity is more difﬁcult to detect than
traditional brute forcing, but will help insulate organizations from a favored tactic used by
APT33.
The introduction of multi-factor authentication has proven to be a highly effective mitigation
practice for many organizations that have historically experienced a high level of credential
stufﬁng and password-spraying attacks.
Monitor criminal underground communities for the availability of new conﬁguration ﬁles
targeting your organization, acquire those ﬁles, and thoroughly analyze them for additional
attack indicators.
End users can reduce the risk of being victimized by password spraying by using a
password manager and setting a unique strong password for each online account.
Social engineering training for company employees can help mitigate threats posed to the
organization by disclosure of information used to conduct password spraying and attacks.
Log analysis (through an IDS) can aid in the identiﬁcation of unsuccessful login attempts
across multiple user accounts. Cross-referencing log data may help to detect incidents
involving high-frequency lockouts, unsanctioned remote access attempts, temporal attack
overlaps across multiple user accounts, and ﬁngerprint unique web browser agent
information.
