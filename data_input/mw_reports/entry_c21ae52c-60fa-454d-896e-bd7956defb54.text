A recent report by Symantec documented a campaign of targeted malware attacks that
began as early as April 2011 and continued up to October 2011. During this time, the
attackers managed to compromise at least 100 computers around the world. This report
illustrates some of the key findings in our latest white paper, Trends in Targeted Attacks.
Targeted Campaigns
Targeted malware attacks are rarely isolated events. It is more useful to think of them as
campaigns – a series of failed and successful attempts to compromise targets over a period
of time. An attacker's prior knowledge of the victim, possibly from a previously successful
attack, affects the level of specificity associated with a single attack in a malware campaign.
In this case, the attackers used messages with an IT security theme that appeared rather
generic but were customized for various targets. The download link in the email messages
was made to appear as if it were pointing to the target’s own website. Often, this less-specific
level of targeting focuses on communities of interest and is aimed at acquiring information to
be used in a future, more precise attack.

Moreover, there is generally a diversity of targets. In this case, the Nitro attackers targeted a
concentration of chemical companies but also targeted human rights NGOs, motor
companies and defense contractors.
Human Interaction
The backdoor used in the Nitro campaign is known as Poison Ivy. It is a freely available
Trojan that provides an attacker with full, "real-time" access to a compromised computer.
One often overlooked component of targeted malware attacks is the reliance on real time
human interaction. This distinguishes them from automated botnets. When the Poison Ivy
backdoor connects to the attackers command and control infrastructure there is a human at
the other end that can begin exploring the compromised computer and the network to which
it belongs. This attacker can steal information, install additional malware and compromise
other machines on the same network. Most importantly, the human on the other end of the
Poison Ivy Trojan can react to defensive measures taken by the victim.
Segmented Infrastructure
Attackers need to deploy command and control (C&C) infrastructure in order to maintain
connectivity to the computers they compromise. The attackers sometimes maintain distinct
sets of C&C infrastructure making it difficult to uncover the full extent of their operations.
Using the initial malware samples, domains and IP addresses provided by Symantec, we
were able to map out three distinct sets of command and control infrastructure. The first set
of command and control infrastructure contains three domains provided by dynamic DNS
services. Attackers often use dynamic DNS services in conjunction with RATs, such as
Poison Ivy. These services make it easy for the attackers to update their C&C domains to
new IP addresses thus maintaining consistent connectivity with the compromised computers.

The second set of C&C infrastructure centers around three domains which all resolved to the
same IP address. The C&C domain, domain.rm6.org was also used in an attack. on the UK
government in August 2011.

The third set centers on the domain antivirus-groups.com and the IP address 204.74.215.58
which Symantec has associated with a specific actor which they've codenamed "Covert
Grove".

This segmented infrastructure allows the same set of attackers to target different potential
victims without having all the attacks linked together. Without additional information, it can be
difficult to link together the full scope of targeted malware campaigns. This illustrates how
important threat intelligence is to defensive strategies. Here are some examples of MD5s
connecting to the Nitro infrastructure:

Defensive strategies can be dramatically improved by understanding how targeted attacks
work as well as trends in the tools, tactics and procedures of the perpetrators. Since such
attacks focus on the acquisition of sensitive data, strategies that focus on protecting the data
itself, wherever it resides, are extremely important components of defense. By effectively
using threat intelligence derived from external and internal sources combined with contextaware data protection and security tools that empower and inform human analysts,
organizations are better positioned to detect and mitigate targeted attacks.
