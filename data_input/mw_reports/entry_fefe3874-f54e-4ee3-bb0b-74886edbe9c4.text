The “never get gifts from strangers” rule applies for suspicious email attachments as well as
enterprises and SMBs alike educate their employees about the dangers lurking in
cyberspace.
One of the most popular threats is malware delivered by email with a malicious document
attached to it. The increasing awareness to this type of attack results in a negative impact on
the success ratio of massive phishing campaigns; however, cybercriminals (as always) are
adapting. This short blog post provides an example of advance tactics that adversaries use
in such campaigns to overcome these challenges.

Leveraging Existing Trust
The rule “never accept gifts from strangers” applies to many settings, including suspicious
email attachments. But what if you recognize the sender? Moreover, the attachment is a part
of an existing email thread?
A recent campaign the attacker leveraged a previously compromised email account
belonging to an employee of a prominent Chamber of Commerce. The adversary sent
generic responses to existing threads, attaching a malicious Microsoft Office document.
Abusing compromised trusted senders is a powerful persuasion tactic, which greatly
increases the chances of opening the malicious attachment even by a trained recipient.
Below is one of the messages sent during this attack. –Most of its contents are authentic, but
the last reply was appended by the attacker:

The attachment is a malicious document prompting the victim to allow macro execution:

The malicious macro is comprised of two modules: the first decodes an embedded command
and the second executing it using the Shell function:

The command itself has another layer of obfuscation, which was added by the publicly
available tool Invoke-DOSfuscation:

Decoding this results in a simple, typical PowerShell script, which downloads an executable
Windows binary from a remote website:

The payload in this case was a Gozi ISFB/Ursnif malware, capable of stealing sensitive data
from a victim. Moreover, once the attackers established compromised the victim’s machine
they might use it to launch future similar campaigns.

Prevented by Minerva
In this case attackers were trying to evade “human detection” by leveraging clever social
engineering techniques and “machine detection” (i.e. evading security products) by
obfuscating the downloader and payload.
Minerva’s Malicious Documents Protection capabilities prevents this evasive threat and
provide useful data to SOC and IR teams, capturing the full context of the attack:
