Conti ransomware, the successor of the notorious Ryuk, has released a data leak site as
part of their extortion strategy to force victims into paying a ransom.
In the past, when the TrickBot trojan infected a network, it would eventually lead to the
deployment of the Ryuk ransomware as a final attack.
According to Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, since July 2020, Ryuk is no longer being
deployed, and in its place, the TrickBot-linked operators, are now deploying the Conti
ransomware.
Conti is a relatively new private Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) that has recruited
experienced hackers to distribute the ransomware in exchange for a large share of the
ransom payment.

Ryuk on the other hand, has seen a steady decline since July.

Conti releases a data leak site
When human-operated ransomware operations attack a corporate network, they commonly
steal unencrypted data before encrypting the files.
This stolen data is then used as leverage to get a victim to pay the ransom under threat that
the files will be released on ransomware data leak sites.
Conti ransomware has been active since this summer, but it wasn't until recently that it
released its own 'Conti.News' data leak site.

Conti data leak site
This data leak site currently lists twenty-six victims, with some of the names being large and
well-known companies.
For each victim listed, a dedicated page is created that contains samples of the stolen data.

Leaked data
The ransomware's adoption stealing data to be used in extortion is also reflected in the
latest ransom notes from Conti.
In the past, the ransomware operators would just include a message that the victim was
encrypted, and include two email addresses to contact them.
Conti ransom notes now include specific language stating that they will publish a victim's
data if a ransom is not paid, as shown below.
