It is a common scenario to come across the various Bitcoin Scams on Dark Web while visiting
various services. Some are even advertised on landing pages of popular Dark Web sites, which
transports users to the luring page of Bitcoin SCAMS. Inexperienced or Less Tech-Savvy
Netizens are stupefied by such posts, falling into the bait; ultimately losing money.
It is also evident that these kinds of scams are being made operational by infamous
Threat Actors such as Dark Hotel (Korea) to gain maximized profit to fund their Cyber
Operations. One such incident pertaining to Magniber Ransomware (which we would be
discussing at the end of this article). Hence, this paved the way for a passive income for
the cyber criminals without directly infecting the intended targets.

Bitcoin — The Greatest Cryptocurrency is currently witnessing an important stage in its Bull
Run, surpassing the Market Value of Facebook (2 days back), to become $760 Billion in its
Market Value. Moreover, the currency had been legalized in various countries such as the
United States, Australia, Japan, Germany, and South Korea. It is also notable that more
countries are in the pipeline of adopting Bitcoin for Economic Stability. Latin American Countries
like Venezuela (Boliver) & Argentina (Peso) had already started to migrate towards CryptoEconomy, where local currency is getting devalued and spiraling down to hyperinflation.
As the adoption rate has gone astronomical, many more concepts are being added to the
Crypto Economic Cultures such as Bitcoin ATMs, KYC-less Exchanges, Paper Wallet, Cold
Wallets etc.

2/18

This provides a detailed view of Bitcoin ATMs installed over the world.
It is also remarkable that Bitcoin forks such as BCH (Bitcoin Cash) are also widely being
accepted for day-to-day trading.

3/18

As adoption rate gets quadrupled, the SCAMS in this arena is also getting matured; hence
defrauding many Bitcoin Enthusiasts. This article explains about 1 such SCAM which are
generally known as Bitcoin Doubling or
What makes these SCAMS successful are various technical pointers which are implemented in
the site to entice the people with partial knowledge and low-maintenance web pages etc. Let’s
look into one of the use-case!
CASE STUDY — REAL TIME

4/18

This is one of the common Introductions found on such Scams, that instructs the users to feed
their Bitcoin Wallet Address and Required Amount by sliding the Amount Pointer to get it
into your account.
There are various factors used in the Website to lure the visitors. Some of them are:Live Stats:- This is used as a Trust Factor for newbies. The records are probably pulled from
the Live Blockchain Transaction Log, repurposing it as Live Stats to showcase the website
activity.

5/18

Live Chat Support:- Bragging about the profit made from the site is being dumped in this
section. Another bait awaiting inexperienced users.

6/18

In order to bust this myth, let’s take a chat conversation and run a plain check:“I thought my friend wanted to fool me with this website link. but you can only get BTC
here if you don't mess up with the fee confirmations”

7/18

Here, you can see similar Bitcoin Sites where the same chat log was found.
: The best part is- Chat Windows even works without Internet Connection (as my power got
disrupted while drafting this), hence proving it to be hard-coded to the website (JS Files).
Receipts: These are tiny pop-ups that appear on the site alerting visitors about its high-activity,
claiming to have received funds by various users.

8/18

Again, if you are running any of the username checks, you will be thrown many SCAM sites.
After feeding a BTC Address, it will run a loader to satisfy the eagerness of the visitors.
Following Script is being shown:-

The above listed script is obtained from this , which reported earlier.
Soon after the progress, following screen would appear claiming to have completed the
doubling process and funds are ready for transmission:-

11/18

Here is the ruse:- Initially you have to deposit $1,300 to Scamster’s Bitcoin Address
1EFJNx1zGSgRf5u2L3oyCQunwa8Xro6ihb receive $3,500 to the user.
By mapping the address, we came to know that this address is active since 4 months and
successfully received a sum of ~$310.

12/18

:- As BTC is fluctuating, the amount gets varied. It also depends upon the fees calculated in the
Scam site.
This is one of the site that still exists on Dark Web with high activity and it is evident that the last
receipt was received a month back (Acc. to Blockchain), proving the scam is not obsolete.
If you think this amount is minuscule, here is another that made around $3,705,769.52 in
a span of 7 years (Still goes unflagged), hosted with Hetzner (159.69.62.95) with this
Wallet Address: 1F7rkmXCouKbCuXF4DbpCwug9xBcsVvnQ5.
While digging deep, a profile got popped up from Bitcoin Talk Forum named Giaky from Italy,
whose Wallet Address was mapped to.

13/18

Note: There is no 100% surety whether the alleged Bitcoin Address belongs to the alleged
user, as the data obtained from a Bitcoin Blacklist Comment.
Similarly, there are a multitude of SCAM Campaign Websites are still operational on both Dark
Web and Surface Web, reaping a high cash flow to Scamster’s account.
Following are some of the details with reaped profits:-

14/18

These are some of the notable websites (that I come across) which are targeting Bitcoin
Doubling fanatics. It is also found that there are a large number of mirror sites for the same
onion such as:-

15/18

According to this Search Engine, there are in-total of 331 Websites (including Mirrors)
exclusively with “BITCOIN DOUBLING” content in it, on Dark Web. Of course, there are more,
but not everything can be indexed by a single entity.
Note: This article covers Dark Web Aspect in more detail rather than Surface Web.
MAGNITUDE EK LINKED WITH BITCOIN MULTIPLIER IN THE PAST
Magnitude is one of the most successful Exploit Kit prevalent on various underground forums
over the years. It delivers Magniber Ransomware upon infection, affecting APAC Region. The
Group (attributed to infamous South Korean Group DarkHotel) works by keeping up-to-date

16/18

with the recently uncovered security loopholes (CVEs) targeting the intended parties. It is a
surprising fact that the group had also operated various Malwertisements and Bitcoin
Scam Websites as per Malware Bytes Report.
It is evident that the Cyber Criminal Groups are using this means as a passive income in order
to fund their cyber attack operations.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
Never ever fall for the Doubling/Multiplier or any sorts of Scams
Cyber Criminals can set up such SCAM sites on a large scale, in order to raise large
amount without directly infecting anyone with Ransomware
This is also a form of Passive Income for Cyber Criminals or a long term investment policy
without any red flags
Always check for the Website Reputation before engulfing all the displayed promises
Check for the Blacklist activities of Bitcoin Address listed on various platforms like
BitcoinWhosWho or Bitcoin Abuse
Be a responsible infosec contributor by flagging malicious Bitcoin Addresses to the said
platforms
