Threat groups such as GOLD KINGSWOOD are using their extensive resources and
network insights to target high-value financial organizations around the world. Thursday,

When the security industry characterizes the e-crime threat landscape, there is a temptation
to focus on the everyday scams and high-volume aspect of the criminal threat landscape.
These criminals are not particular about targets if there are financial rewards at the end.
Obvious examples of these types of scams are the widely distributed malware aimed at
stealing bank account credentials and the ransomware disseminated through large-scale
spam phishing campaigns.
These criminals can earn a decent income over time netting smaller "financial fish" through
opportunistic scams. However, some cybercriminals are setting their aims higher and
focusing on much larger fish. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have
observed a growing threat from sophisticated threat actors who pursue high-value targets
such as banks and financial services companies and have the capability to exploit and
monetize access to payment and other financial systems. CTU™ researchers call one of
these threat groups GOLD KINGSWOOD.

GOLD KINGSWOOD: An advanced persistent cybercrime group
GOLD KINGSWOOD (also known as the Cobalt Gang) is a capable, sophisticated, and
financially motivated criminal threat group that has successfully compromised financial
organizations since at least 2016. The group uses targeted network intrusion tactics to
locate, access, and abuse systems that can be monetized. As of March 2018, the threat
actors had reportedly stolen approximately $1.2 billion USD through their global operations.
Unlike most criminally motivated e-crime actors observed by CTU researchers, GOLD
KINGSWOOD's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are similar to attributes of
traditional government-sponsored or espionage-driven threat actors. For example, in
operations against the First Commercial Bank (FCB) of Taiwan, GOLD KINGSWOOD used
custom malware that leveraged CSCWCNG.dll, which is specific to the ATM hardware used
at FCB. After receiving confirmation of the ATM locations where money mules were waiting,
the threat actors executed commands to dispense money from the machines. This incident
demonstrated GOLD KINGSWOOD's vast technical and human resources.

GOLD KINGSWOOD serves up a SpicyOmelette
In 2018, CTU researchers observed several GOLD KINGSWOOD campaigns involving
SpicyOmelette, a tool used by the group during initial exploitation of an organization. This
sophisticated JavaScript remote access tool is generally delivered via phishing, and it uses
multiple defense evasion techniques to hinder prevention and detection activities. GOLD
KINGSWOOD delivered SpicyOmelette through a phishing email containing a shortened link
that appeared to be a PDF document attachment. When clicked, the link used the Google
AppEngine to redirect the system to a GOLD KINGSWOOD-controlled Amazon Web
Services (AWS) URL that installed a signed JavaScript file, which was SpicyOmelette.

CTU analysis of one of GOLD KINGSWOOD's campaign using SpicyOmelette (DOC2018.js)
exposed additional sophisticated methods to compromise targets. A valid digital certificate
was used to sign the malicious script. Windows Scripting Host supports the inclusion of
digital signatures, and Figure 2 shows how the signature was appended to the script.
Depending on the security profile of the victim's system, a pop-up notification may have
warned about running external content. However, the system would have also indicated that
the script was signed by a valid and trusted certificate authority (CA). SpicyOmelette also
passed parameters to a valid Microsoft utility, which allowed the threat actors to execute
arbitrary JavaScript code on a compromised system and bypass many applicationwhitelisting defenses.

Once installed, SpicyOmelette provides an ideal foothold onto a targeted system for GOLD
KINGSWOOD. It enables the threat actors to perform various actions:
profile the infected system for information (e.g., running software, system name, IP
address)
install additional malware onto the system
check for the presence of 29 different antivirus tools

3/4

The access provided by SpicyOmelette and other post-compromise tools regularly used by
GOLD KINGSWOOD helps the threat actors escalate privileges on a system by stealing
account credentials, survey and evaluate the compromised environment, identify desirable
systems (e.g., payment systems, payment gateways, ATM systems), and deploy malware
specifically designed to target those systems.

Conclusion
The ‘advanced' nature of GOLD KINGSWOOD intrusions stems from the care and focus that
the threat actors exhibit, specifically finding and accessing systems of interest. Arrests of
suspected GOLD KINGSWOOD operators in March 2018 did not deter the threat group's
campaigns, likely due to its vast network of resources. CTU researchers expect GOLD
KINGSWOOD's operations and toolset to continue to evolve, and financial organizations of
all sizes and geographies could be exposed to threats from this group. The threat group's
detailed understanding of financial systems and history of successful campaigns make it a
formidable threat.
