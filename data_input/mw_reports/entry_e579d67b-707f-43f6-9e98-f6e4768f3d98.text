Burned and Blinded: Escalation Risks of
Intelligence Loss from Countercyber
Operations in Crisis
Abstract: As the limitations of purely defensive cyber operations continue to
be demonstrated in the continuing pressure of hostile cyberthreats, the U.S.
government has introduced new doctrine to shape countercyber operations
(CCO) leveraging offensive options to degrade threat capabilities and
infrastructure. Planners have only begun to understand the broader
implications of these new concepts in difficult periods of crisis. The article
explores the parallels to other strategic early warning and intelligence
capabilities, surfacing distinctions based on the unique dynamics of
cyberconflict to identify scenarios in which CCO successes may prove
potentially destabilizing and lead to greater escalation risk.

States leverage offensive cyber operations capabilities for multiple purposes,
including as one aspect of a wider intelligence contest by which they seek to

understand the diplomatic and military intentions, and plans, of a
competitor. Sustained intrusion campaigns are documented by researchers,
and attributed by industry and governments on a recurring basis, providing
evidence of this ongoing activity in pursuit of states’ espionage needs.1
Identifying and defeating these intrusions is a routine task for defensive cyber
operations elements. Yet these efforts have proven limited in the face of
sustained adversary threat pressures, leading states and other actors
increasingly to employ their own offensive capabilities in countercyber
operations (CCO) intended to track, deny, and contest hostile intrusion
access and supporting infrastructure.
CCO are given increased importance under the U.S. government’s
adoption of a new doctrine of persistent engagement, implementing a
strategic shift to defend forward in cyberspace to contest hostile offensive
cyber operations involving espionage and disruption of critical U.S., allied,
and partner national infrastructure. This doctrine advances the proposition
that engagements in the cyberenvironment are emerging as a new form of
crisis interaction, where adversaries compete over initiative and position in
order to access and hold at risk key sources of national power.2 The doctrine
developed as an alternative to the challenges in adapting earlier strategic
approaches based on deterrence and coercion theories to the new warfighting
domain in the first decades of operations.3 From this doctrine arises the need
to challenge adversaries that currently operate freely within compromised
systems and networks, in order to reset the fundamental conditions of
security within the environment.4
This is a difficult proposition in an environment that has generally been
acknowledged to at least favor the offense, if not one that is offense-dominant
(even as the contours of this balance remain debated).5 New U.S. Cyber
Command thinking acknowledges continued defensive countermeasures to
secure systems and networks, and efforts to reduce vulnerabilities across the
technology ecosystem—including through strengthened partnerships and
improved liaison engagement for information sharing and collaborative
missions to remediate compromised systems. However, it is the proposed
employment of offensive cyber operations in defensive cyber operations
response actions, and more broadly for CCO objectives, that deserves
further attention.
There is, however, only limited discussion to date in the unclassified
literature regarding the operational aspects that may result in escalation
problems arising from countercyber actions under the persistent engagement
doctrine. In part, this is likely because these problems—and the mechanisms
by which they are mitigated—are relatively obvious to experienced offensive
operators, planners, and their leadership. Yet there are an increasing number
of parties newly arrived to the space who lack technical grounding, crucial

mission context, and appropriate mental models by which to understand the
contours of operations. This is especially notable when the topic is discussed
in high-level conversations regarding comparative policy and strategy
approaches. The further exegesis therefore may offer new utility toward
resolving problems where operators and intelligence officers/analysts find
themselves talking past policy staff and academic audiences. Additional
consideration of these issues is also likely to improve the training and
education of future cyberwarriors and those that support these missions
through intelligence, capabilities development, and wargaming within the
wider community of practice. It becomes further critical to understand the
operational and strategic implications of this novel doctrine, especially as
foreign allies now also consider the alignment of their own efforts in a
similar manner.6
To such ends, this article proceeds in six parts. It first sets out the objectives
of the countercyber mission and distinguishes this mission from similar
countering problems. I next consider the frequently raised concern that such
operations result in escalation, as adversaries react to lost capabilities or
perceived threats to their positions. Generally accepted intelligence case
histories of intelligence losses are identified, encompassing the loss of national
technical means of early warning, loss of spies during mobilization, loss of
signals intelligence due to sudden adversary emissions control, and roll-up of
saboteur networks; and are mapped to parallel cyber incidents. I then propose
a typology of possible CCO actions and associated reactions by adversary
offensive cyberplanners. From these interactions, I offer a series of
propositions to explain the dynamics of escalation that may arise from such
operations. On the basis of these propositions, the article closes with a set of
conclusions identifying how escalation risk may be reduced when considering
intervention options.
The article offers conceptual contributions that identify and explain
potential sources of escalation where hostile cyberespionage operations are
degraded by CCO actions, illustrated through examples drawn from the
empirical case record. This article also provides new theoretic contributions
that outline principles for future operational design and execution intended
to minimize potential flareback and escalation—principles that are also
intended to form the basis of future research design and testing by analysts
and intelligence studies scholars seeking to validate and expand on these
contributions.
COUNTERCYBER MISSION
CCO actively seek to deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, and destroy adversary
offensive cybercampaigns. While these objectives may be expressed through a
variety of language, depending on the year and the organizational or doctrinal

alignment of the planners, the intent remains consistent.7 States may leverage
offensive cyber capabilities for a variety of espionage, sabotage, direct action,
and operational preparation of the environmental objectives in anticipation of
future conflict. While individual incidents involving compromise of specific
target nodes may be more notable in open-source reporting, the proper unit of
analysis to understand these activities is at the level of the campaign—where
adversaries manage difficult tradeoffs of nondetection, persistence,
management of scarce offensive capabilities, and effects outcomes.8 CCO seeks
to defeat adversary access, freedom of maneuver, and positional advantage for
these campaigns—and in so doing, remove specific capabilities from the
adversary’s future options space, and arsenal.
These are explicitly operational-level objectives. If successfully executed,
they limit adversary options and associated courses of action, serving to
shape adversary behaviors. Accomplishing these objectives is often intended
to change the balance of initiative between opposing forces. Success may
change the timing of actions in ongoing engagements as well as shift potential
future phases. Cumulatively, these impacts may alter operator, planner, and
decisionmaker perceptions of ongoing exchanges. These operational
objectives in turn may then connect to strategic-level outcomes. Such
strategic outcomes may include deterrence (whether by denial, or by changing
perceptions of risk and therefore punishment amid failing operations), or
alternatively the emergence of tacit agreement toward more responsible
behaviors.9 But these strategic objectives differ from the operational
interactions of ways and means—and the associated adversary reactions—
that I consider in this article.
Concepts of operation for CCO may echo earlier parallels familiar to both
air planners and counterintelligence professionals. Offensive counterair
missions, and associated operations against ballistic missile targets, are
superficially suggested when considering the domain. However, there are
distinct differences that require these cyber operations to be evaluated on
their own terms.
Cyberengagements, unlike air operations, are not defined by sorties. Nor
are adversary capabilities assembled in fixed configurations within a common
order of battle such as an air wing. These capabilities are not dependent on
fixed inventories of commodities such as petroleum, oil, and lubricants that
are subject to depletion-absent logistics replenishment on a deterministic
schedule.10 Rather, the employment of offensive cyber capabilities portfolios
may involve operations over an extended period of time—either for
espionage objectives or as operational preparation of the environment for
future effects options. Even where capabilities are leveraged for prompt
effects, they may leverage supporting infrastructure composed at point of
need that leverage longstanding vulnerabilities and unaddressed exposures.11
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE

PERSPECTIVE

Likewise, counterintelligence framing poses specific challenges that would
burden CCO in a too narrowly restrictive model. Again, superficial
similarities do exist. Further, some useful parallels may be considered in the
detection of particularized intrusions by hostile intelligence services, and
within the option space when defining objectives in turning, shaping, and
degrading adversary access. However, CCO actions occur more broadly than
within law enforcement context, or even the broader scope of a national
intelligence organization’s presence and activities, that typically defines
counterintelligence as practiced to date. Counterintelligence practitioners
have themselves criticized the narrowness of historical and contemporary
practice, likely with a view toward an expanded remit.12 In the absence of
this established role, CCO therefore fall to other professionals within the
distinct cyber mission. Opportunities for synergistic coordination between the
disciplines are noted, however, in the conclusion of this article.
ESCALATION FEARS
Proposals to employ CCO options in order to relieve hostile pressure on
defended systems are frequently challenged on the basis that any response
actions conducted outside of one’s own network—touching adversary
infrastructure—may provoke escalation. Generally, existing scholarship finds
that cyber operations do not commonly result in escalation.13 However, the
prospect is never far from the debate, informed by early and insightful work
theorizing the trajectory of capabilities yet to fully mature.14
The challenges of escalation management within the context of
proposed countering options under the doctrine of persistent engagement
has been a key point of concern since the introduction of these concepts,
and subject to continuing debate as the intellectual originators of the
approach and the leadership that has adopted this thinking continue to
seek to articulate their vision.15 In part, this likely stems from the
longstanding focus within the international relations community on the
issues of escalation between states in competition and conflict across
multiple domains—where extension of these ideas into the new operating
environment is a natural line of thinking. The uncomfortable silence of
professionals restricted from public discussion of classified matters has
also complicated understanding of these issues, where key distinctions of
operational art are missed and oversimplified generalizations lead to
confusion over targets, actions on objectives, and effects assessment. There
nonetheless remains a legitimate space of concern where the unknowns of
these new concepts of operation intersect with complex adversary
intelligence and military services, their associated contractor and proxy
organizations, and the authoritarian regime leadership that directs the
activities of these entities. A number of scholars have explored issues
AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

related to causal chains of escalation and associated feedback loops, rules
of engagement considerations, emotional factors impacting escalation
decisions, other higher-order effects that may drive escalation, concerns
about differing adversary reactions to operations conducted at scale,
cross-domain interactions leading to escalation, and the potential for both
adversary and allied/partner perception and misperception of persistent
engagement activities leading to inadvertent escalation.16
U.S. Cyber Command has even been accused, in both formal
literature and informal discussion, of not having considered the
potential for escalation involved in countering operations under the
persistent engagement framework.17 These concerns may have initially
been valid given the early limited information about the doctrine that
had been disclosed publicly, but increasingly are simply unfair, given
that they are contradicted by direct testimony regarding leadership
attention to the issue. 18 Evidence of such considerations as a key
component of planning for offensive capabilities employment is
documented in declassified operational materials released by Cyber
Command from earlier engagements by Joint Task Force ARES against
Daesh to counter violent extremist propaganda, recruitment, and other
key activities—the most significant publicly acknowledged offensive
cybercampaign acknowledged to date.19 There is no reason to believe
that such a crucial area of emphasis would be arbitrarily abandoned in
subsequent missions where offensive capabilities were directed toward
countering objectives—especially where Cyber Command leadership has
emphasized the continuing utility and validity of this operational
precedent as a model for future mission organization, coordination, and
execution.20
It is important to note that escalation here is posited by critics both as
the result of operational acts, involving the direct engagements of
opposing forces on the wire, as well as through perceptions (and
misperception) that may arise among observers and the decisionmakers to
whom they report. Multiple factors may contribute to escalation decisions,
interweaving operational realities, variable situational awareness,
incompletely understood technical complexity, emotional responses, and
flawed operational planning or execution. These factors may, however, be
largely abstracted for the purposes of this analysis, which focuses on
dynamics between the offensive actor and the countering responder
(although further research to explore the relative impact of these factors
would of course likely provide much value, as has been seen in other
studies of escalation in differing domains). These dynamics arise from
intersection of operational positions, extant capabilities, and relative
initiative and are structural in nature.

PARALLELS IN ANALOGY TO INTELLIGENCE INTERACTIONS IN CRISIS
If one considers the interactions of offensive and CCO as a contest of
intelligence, it is natural to look to prior parallels in intelligence studies that
will offer insight into what are the particularly dangerous interactions
between competitor states—particularly those that are in heightened states of
tension or approaching conflict. Dynamics that might encourage escalation at
these moments are particularly of concern when planning future operations,
or when evaluating evidence of current operations. Even if not all operational
choices, or potential countering courses of action, may drive escalatory
outcomes there are almost certainly some subsets more likely to contribute to
such concerns.
Intelligence history points to four potential parallels that may be
considered analogies, where the loss of intelligence resources at a particularly
critical moment may be dangerously destabilizing and may potentially lead to
uncontrolled escalation. While it is recognized that analogies are difficult in
cyber operations, they still remain a starting point to consider the problem
space.21 Upon this basis, scholars may then build better inferences derived
from case evidence.
These four parallels were identified through a review of the Cyber
Disruptions Dataset, encompassing more than 100 cases of operational
disruption of adversary cyber operations through administrative, defensive,
and CCO techniques.22 Through these case studies, intelligence equities not
accounted for in conventional consideration of disruption factors were
identified for further analysis. While additional such equities are likely to be
observed in future interactions, these parallels form a substantial starting
point for framing relative value in contest.
Loss of National Technical Means of Early Warning
The first analogy is the parallel encountered when facing a sudden loss of
early warning capabilities in a nuclear crisis. The role of national technical
means, including overhead electro-optical and radar imagery, nonimaging
infrared sensors, and over the horizon radar are acknowledged to have been
crucial elements in stabilizing extended militarized competition between the
Soviet Union and the West, especially the United States. The capabilities,
reliability, and the repeatedly proven track record of these systems over the
decades have removed much concern about potential undetected surprise
missile attack—especially in the most common reference “bolt out of the
blue” strategic nuclear scenarios. While this assurance remains always a
matter that must be revalidated with every new generation of weapons
systems, sensor architectures, and command and control models, it remains a
foundational concept for warfighters, planners, and decisionmakers. It has

therefore long been recognized that sudden and unexpected loss of these
capabilities, and the assurance they provide, in times of crisis may be
considered a strong indicator of conflict initiation.23
This has not stopped extensive consideration of the conditions under which
offensive actions against early warning capabilities might be required, and of
the various means by which such attacks may be carried out. Much of the
development of military space control capabilities—including direct ascent
antisatellite (ASAT) weapons, on-orbit engagement platforms, direct energy,
and electronic warfare options must be evaluated against this backdrop. This
is notable in Russian capabilities development from the Cold War through to
recent maneuvers by the Russian Cosmos 2543 “inspector” shadowing the
USA245 satellite, reported by open sources to be a KH-11 CRYSTAL
imagery intelligence (IMINT) platform—and subsequent apparent testing of
kinetic intercept capabilities.24 Likewise, the People’s Liberation Army has
extensively explored options to target space-based assets—including explicit
planning for actions against early-warning satellites, and realization of both
high-energy laser and kinetic ASAT test events.25 However, the longstanding
debate over such actions in theory and in practice has extended the
acknowledgment—in both explicit interactions and in tacit military
preparations—that actions that may blind technical means to potential
surprise attack are not to be taken lightly.
The analogy to CCO against active intrusion is immediately apparent.
Indeed, the problem has been previously highlighted in scholarship examining
potential escalation—notably by Jason Healey and Robert Jervis. These
gentlemen argue that cyber interactions in crisis may be unexpectedly
escalatory, especially as offensive cyber options are likely to be used early in
the conflict, leading to a greater chance of miscalculation driven by the
stronger first-use pressures in offensive-advantaged cyber interactions—
particularly where intelligence failures have occurred.26 Deliberate CCO that
target adversary cyberespionage activities providing access against core
leadership communications or strategic command and control architectures
are of course then likely a matter of first objectives, intended to deny and
degrade adversary intelligence. The sudden loss of accesses previously
enjoyed by hostile intelligence organizations leaves a vacuum—which in less
mature organizations, or in support of less experienced leadership, may thus
be filled by the enemy’s worst fears.
No direct case evidence for such analogies becoming manifest in CCO
interactions has yet emerged. Similar scenarios have, however, developed in
consideration of defensive cyber operations where adversary operators have
achieved substantial access to core command and control, leadership, and
intelligence communications. These have included the reported widespread
compromise of U.S. military systems by operators attributed to the Russian
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE

PERSPECTIVE

Federal Security Service in the early phases of the intrusion set tracked by
industry variously under the cryptonyms Turla/VENOMOUS BEAR/IRON
HUNTER, which drove U.S. government defensive response in Operation
BUCKSHOT YANKEE. In this case, extensive penetration of U.S.
government networks had presumably provided Russian intelligence services
with aggressive visibility into current deployments, future planning, and
policymaker thinking that would undoubtably provoke anxieties upon
sudden loss after eviction.27 Likewise, compromise of the Republic of Korea
(ROK) wartime contingency planning by Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK) cyberespionage may be considered, again leading to defensive
countermeasures responses by ROK defenders to evict North Korean hackers
from military networks.28 The loss of extensive espionage-derived insights
into South Korean (and by extension U.S.) military intentions fits this case—
especially against the backdrop of ongoing tensions over the North’s
prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
However, to date, these cases are not publicly known to have incorporated
active CCO— although one can immediately see the value such options
would have played in these incidents. Neither of these examples proved
escalatory—in no small part likely due to the lesser immediacy in the tensions
between competitor states at the time of intrusion detection and defensive
response eviction. Should an adversary have observed CCO interventions
leading to the loss of access, one may consider that a potentially different
reaction may have resulted.
Loss of Spies during Mobilization
Likewise, CCO that deny and degrade an adversary’s ongoing
cyberespionage access against competitor networks may be likened in
analogy to the arrest or other loss of human agents in place prior to military
mobilization. Intelligence history is replete with examples of assets tasked
with espionage against preparations for movement, either by a state that may
be readying to bring its forces to the field or by a state that will strike
through invasion or other offensive action. In the early modern world,
espionage focused on port and shipbuilding activities required for fleet
mobilization—for example, in operations targeting Louis XIV’s fleet at
Toulon and Marseilles in the late 1690s.29 In the industrial age, this
espionage frequently targeted the railways enabling mass troop and materiel
movements—such as in German and French espionage seeking to understand
potential Russian troop movements against Turkey in 1887.30
Case evidence for such analogies having played out in real-world CCO
interactions remains as yet difficult to document publicly. Nonetheless, a
similar scenario may be seen in the SOLAR SUNRISE incident, in which
U.S. military networks were compromised during a period of heightened
AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

tensions corresponding with mobilization for Operation DESERT FOX
airstrikes in support of United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
nuclear inspections in Iraq. Initial attribution theories of this intrusion
included potential action by Iraqi intelligence services, based on technical
factors of previously known Iraqi access to at the time what were then
limited Internet connectivity options routing through the United Arab
Emirates. However, this attribution theory was incorrect, and the intrusion
was subsequently linked to ego-motivated juvenile cybercriminals.31 Again,
this case resulted in only defensive cyber operations and law-enforcement
response. It should be noted that this incident was among the earliest actions
of the emerging cyber mission, and while the elements of the scenario are
useful in considering analogy, improvements in attribution capability and
countering capacity would likely mean future responses would differ
markedly in contemporary engagement.
Loss of Signals Intelligence Due to Sudden Adversary
Emissions Control
The third analogy is one that shifts perspective and agency from that of the
actor-engaged CCO to the offensive operators whose targeted action is
intended to be degraded or disrupted. An adversary who deliberately goes
“radio silent” has long been recognized as a warning indicator suggesting
imminent conflict. However, in practice, such observed indications are
considered highly variable in potential severity due to the frequency with
which emissions control may occur for various periods of time within a
military or intelligence organization. The most severe analogies are the
deliberate destruction of codes and cipher machines by diplomatic embassies.
This is a historically grave step, not least of which given the challenges of
provisioning new secure communications that are amplified in a time of
crisis, in order to reverse this decision and restore routine channels.
Intelligence history provides the analogous case of “Black Friday,” where
new Soviet communications security measures resulted in immediate loss of
communications intelligence access as ciphers that had previously been
subjects of successful cryptanalysis were replaced by new special purpose
cipher machines and associated communications nets across the General Staff
and military districts culminating on 29 October 1948.32 This incident,
occurring over a several-month period from at least August 1948, was sudden
in intelligence terms but sufficiently delayed as to preclude immediate
warning of war. The cooling off effects of rolling communications security
implementation were further tempered by the lack of other source
indications, and the American perceptions of nuclear superiority that would
not be shattered until the detonation of the first Soviet nuclear weapon,
RDS-1, the next year.
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE

11

PERSPECTIVE

Adversary adaptation in cyber operations in order to defeat defensive
cyber operations and intelligence campaign tracking is not unusual.
Retooling after disclosure, or at some planned periodicity, or after some
degree of operational degradation based on perceived exposure, is a common
offensive operator behavior.33 However, an offensive planner that becomes
aware of countercyber pressure—especially where countercyber network
exploitation is used to inform defensive detection and passive
countermeasures—may regain the initiative through retooling, rebuilding
fresh command, and control infrastructure, or shifting tactics/techniques/
procedures (TTP).
Beyond routine disclosures driven by digital forensics and incident
response or other defensive intelligence interactions, sudden or
otherwise unexpected loss of offensive visibility to countercyber
actions, particularly in a time of crisis tension, may lead to dangerous
misinterpretation by immature analysts, planners, or leaders. This risk
may be amplified as defender cyber intelligence functions detect
renewed intrusion activity using new tooling, infrastructure, or TTP
that may be attributed to prior adversary activity groups due to
incomplete offensive refresh. Such renewed activity—particularly if an
offensive operator is seeking to reestablish the scope and scale of prior
access—may be mistakenly seen as intensification. Where such access
extends further into sensitive networks or critical infrastructure systems
than defenders may have been previously aware of—even if operators
are merely restoring status quo ante—such behaviors may be further
interpreted as escalation.
Real-world case examples of such interactions may include apparent
countercyber intervention against the ATP28/FANCY BEAR/IRON
TWILIGHT attributed VPNFilter botnet infrastructure operated by the
Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).34 In this
case, however, the risk of adversary intensification or escalation does not
appear to have been realized in the absence of other critical external
conflict factors at the time—despite ongoing tensions involving the
Russian military occupation of territory in Ukraine. Subsequent apparent
intervention against the CYCLOPS BLINK botnet infrastructure—
assessed by multiple intelligence services as a successor to the VPNFilter
codebase—in the period immediately preceding renewed invasion in
February 2022 may also be considered.35 Given Russian forces’ apparent
full commitment to preplanned actions attempting to seize Kyiv, it is
difficult to assess any action here as escalatory in context of the
immediate conflict dyad. (The question of escalation against wider North
Atlantic Treaty Organization interests, in this case, being also as yet
unresolved as the conflict continues.)

Roll-Up of Saboteur Networks
The fourth analogy that may be explored from intelligence history is the
moment in which saboteur networks and other direct action elements are
detected and interdicted (colloquially, rolled up) during crisis tensions. There
are conditions in which defenders in the course of routine counterintelligence
activities may become aware of potential adversary espionage and
subversion, intended to provide hostile options for operational preparation of
the environment.
While such scenarios are always of concern, crisis factors may lead to a
more immediate and interventionist response than might otherwise be
pursued in times of routine competition as defenders evaluate the potential
for imminent damage to their interests. One can see these dynamics at work
in a number of historical cases. In 1917, the destruction of military shipyards
and vessels by Imperial saboteurs proved a serious threat to U.S. logistics on
the eve of entry into World War I. 36 Likewise, Great Britain had long feared
potential labor strikes fomented by German assets to disrupt trade and
defensive preparations in advance of the war. 37 UK intelligence concern
would further extend to potential foreign support to Irish Republican Army
terrorism, focused particularly on potential direct action against rail
chokepoints that might impede the movement of forces in response to a
feared German invasion in 1943.38 During the Cold War, Soviet services
invested substantial effort into planning and preparation for direct action by
intelligence and special forces elements intended for the opening hours of a
war never fought in Europe. This concept of operations was famously
profiled in novelist Tom Clancy’s fictional depiction Red Storm Rising, in
which a traffic accident led to the compromise of a spetsnaz element tasked
with striking targets in Germany on the eve of a major armored offensive by
Soviet troops.39 However, these same playbooks were well demonstrated in
reality during the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, leveraging State
Committee for Security (KGB) special purpose troops and GRU spetsnaz in
a desant action to enable rapid seizure of power under operational plan
STORM-333.40 Similar tactical actions by “little green men”—irregular
forces, private military contractors, and their GRU advisors—were observed
in the Russian occupation of Ukrainian territories including Crimea in
2014.41 A nearly identical concept of operations likely underpinned the
immediate phase of the renewed invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, based
on observed initial desant operations in the vicinity of Kyiv.42
CCO case examples fitting these analogies are likewise difficult to publicly
document. However, parallels may be drawn in a few serious incidents. In
2016, the PATCHWORK/KATAR/MONSOON intrusion set reportedly
compromised the personal security detail providing executive protection for a
neighboring regional state’s head of government.43 Beyond the political

intelligence value here, the potential kinetic implications of information
acquired through such an intrusion are grave, particularly where they may
involve advance knowledge of the movements of the principal. However, the
incident was detected by third-party commercial cybersecurity researchers,
and it is not known if the target state was aware of the incident. In any event,
no disruptive countercyber action against this intrusion activity was noted.
Yet, had such events transpired during a period of heightened tensions, and
involved even a slightly different but yet still entirely plausible fact pattern,
the potential escalation concerns are obvious.
Some degree of similar concern likely attaches to the compromise of White
House communications networks attributed to Russian intelligence services
reported publicly in 2014, although the extent of this intrusion was likely
more limited and would have offered less substantial insights into presidential
movements around which a greater degree of classification control is
presumably exercised.44 North Korean attributed HIDDEN COBRA/
LAZARUS offensive operators were observed leveraging lure documents
associated with, and potentially seeking to compromise, information related
to Presidential Special Mission aircraft and Executive Flight Detachment
units. 45 This incident must likely be considered as triggering a much higher
degree of risk—particularly against the backdrop of tensions between North
Korea and the United States during the spring of 2017. Yet, even in this case,
escalation was not noted—–suggesting an even greater degree of tension, or
less ambiguous indications of intent, as the true threshold for escalation risk.
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CCO AND OFFENSIVE CYBER ESPIONAGE
AND OPERATIONAL PREPARATION OF ENVIRONMENT CAMPAIGNS
Even as case evidence remains immature due to the paucity of CCO to date,
analogies and their substantiating indications remain sufficient to permit the
first outlines of potential interactions between CCO actions against offensive
campaigns to be drawn. One may systematically consider the following types
of CCO actions relevant within the potential scenarios in which potential
higher risk of escalation must be evaluated. These represent only a subset of
the full spectrum of CCO options within the action and reaction space
corresponding to the above-described parallels.
Burn, and Overtly Attribute
CCO engagement against an adversary offensive cybercampaign results in
public disclosure and attribution, including potential “name and shame”
operations. Known cases of such activities to date have included CCO
targeting APT29/COZY BEAR/IRON HEMLOCK.46

PERSPECTIVE

Burn and Leak, through Third-Party Commercial
Intelligence Disclosure
CCO engagement results in compromise of ongoing adversary offensive
operations, and resulting visibility is used to drive attribution and campaign
tracking by commercial and other industry cyberintelligence activities. The
disclosure in the 2014 burning of the Careto/Mask intrusion set attributed to
the Spanish national intelligence service, and the 2014 disclosure of the
Machete/Andromeda intrusion set attributed to the government of Colombia,
may potentially be considered as examples of such cases.47 More recently, the
April 2022 disclosure of the PIPEDREAM/INCONTROLLER malware that
was designed to deliver destructive effects against industrial control systems
may also provide an example. While first known to have been publicly
described by commercial intelligence services, multiple government agencies
joined in providing coordinated warning and technical analysis.48 This case is
particularly unusual in that the payload was reportedly found and recovered
before its operational deployment.49
Burn and Leak, through Third-Party Covert Influence Disclosure
CCO engagement compromises adversary offensive campaigns but
information related to these campaigns is selectively leaked via third parties.
Such publication may result in disclosure of malware and other intrusion
tooling, identification of active intrusion infrastructure, as well as
information leading to organizational and individual attribution. Western
media reporting suggests that at least some part of disclosures in 2019
burning APT34/OILRIG/HELIX KITTEN/COBALT GYPSY/CHRYSENE
intrusions, attributed to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security,
resulted from such deliberate covert action measures.50 However, media
coverage of these alleged interventions lacks the clarity needed to distinguish
this case more comprehensively.
Burn, Detected by Adversary after Deliberate CCO
Clandestine Signaling
In some instances, no public acknowledgment of a CCO action may be
observed. The adversary becomes aware of the impact to their offensive
campaigns only by deliberate messaging—such as through explicit
communication to operators within a command and control infrastructure or
another closed environment, or demonstrative action across other live
architectures—intended to serve clandestine signaling purposes. While
intrusion set operators are unlikely to disclose that such messaging has
occurred, leading to a lack of real-world case examples, law-enforcement
botnet takedowns have used extant command and control channels to notify

victims of remediation options. This was notable in the case of the Bredolab/
Oficla spam infrastructure disruption in October 2010.51 Such messaging was
presumably also observed by the adversary and could be therefore limited
only to adversary nodes.

Burn, Detected by Adversary Due to Loss
Not all actions intended to deny or degrade adversary offensive operations
may be immediately understood by those conducting the campaigns in
question. In particular, threat activity at scale typically involves a series of
otherwise routine frictions and failures that must be overcome to sustain a
campaign effectively over time against normal changes to target system and
network configuration, even before considering defensive countermeasures.
CCO pressures may therefore only be noticed by an adversary at some
threshold of loss. Under differing scenarios, it may be possible that the
adversary will not understand the cause and origin of the loss, while in other
circumstances, the manner and scope of loss may be unmistakable. A recent
case example is provided where an Iranian-aligned attribution front known
as the Jerusalem Electronic Army, involved in active intrusion campaigns
attempting to sabotage Israeli critical infrastructure networks, publicly
acknowledged disruptive and destructive CCO impact to the group’s
technical infrastructure.52

Burn, Failed Attempt at CCO Intervention
Sometimes even the best planned and executed CCO options may not result
in substantive impact to degrade or deny adversary offensive capabilities.
Such failures may result from a variety of operational, technical, or timing
factors. In some subset of failure cases, adversary intrusion sets may become
aware of CCO pressures and react even if the CCO objectives were not met.
State-level CCO failures are even more poorly documented than other types
of CCO actions. However, case examples may be observed in takedown
actions against criminal infrastructure—including botnet activities reportedly
also repurposed for official intelligence purposes by hostile foreign
intelligence organizations, such as in the October 2015 failure of a disruptive
action targeting Dridex/Bugat.53
From these various types of CCO actions, one may anticipate the
following range of potential adversary offensive cyber planner reactions, in
from least to worst possible escalation severity. Again, these do not
encompass the full range of possible responses to any CCO, but rather follow
directly from the earlier parallel scenarios and associated actions.

Surge Operations to Regain Access and Capabilities Positioning
using Existing Tooling
An adversary seeks to restore prior options, either out of perceived crisis
necessity or internal bureaucratic pressures driven by organizational culture,
leadership demands, or similar common factors that drive programmatic
decisions within military and intelligence services.
Surge Operations to Regain Access and Capabilities Positioning
using Less Mature Capabilities
An adversary operator may substitute novel exploit and implant tooling to
replace previously burned malware. There is the potential that these
capabilities may not have undergone the same degree of operational test and
evaluation. Such risk is of course magnified where adversaries do not conduct
a formal assessment of new capabilities within controlled range environments
complete with target representative components.54 Likewise, operators and
planners may be less familiar with these tools, and the edge cases where such
tooling may produce unintended consequences or other collateral damage
across complex target systems and networks. Even where adversaries may
have previously sought to pursue a degree of responsibility in the conduct of
offensive cyber operations, time pressures may lead to operator or developer
errors, or other failure modes.55 These failures in turn may lead to escalatory
conditions that more deliberate operations might have avoided.
Surge Operations to Innovate New Access and Capabilities
Positioning
Regardless of the capabilities replacement approaches described previously,
an adversary may choose to use these capabilities in new ways not previously
seen in an effort to acquire new options for employment in the context of the
ongoing crisis. Such innovation is generally considered to require some
degree of preoperational intelligence and planning effort, but in a complex
and dynamically moving situation, there may often be fleeting opportunities
that an adversary may recognize that can deliver unique value. Further, while
careful targeting and deliberate effort to achieve access for longer-term
persistence, with emphasis on capabilities that remain NOBUS (available to
Nobody but US), is a hallmark of the “Western way” or even “American
way” of offensive cyber operations, other adversaries may not place the same
value on such characteristics.56 Where such efforts involve targets an
adversary has not previously pursued, or involve a higher probability of
detection/effects maximized operational decisionmaking tradeoffs, it is more
likely that these behaviors will be interpreted as intensification and escalation
when and where they are observed.
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE

PERSPECTIVE

Imminent Conflict Assumption
An adversary believes that war or other escalated conflict is likely in the near
term, based on analogies to other intelligence interactions, and may execute
preplanned courses of action for war initiation. In these scenarios, planner
and operations management flexibility may be reduced as mobilization and
opening salvo logics take hold and may force operations into more linear and
more aggressive modalities than seen in operations employing dynamic
decisionmaking processes while short of conflict.
PROPOSITIONS: DETERMINANTS OF ADVERSARY REACTIONS
Based on the scope of the outlined interactions, the following propositions
may be advanced to describe key determinants of adversary reactions to
CCO that disrupt, degrade, or deny their capabilities in a time of crisis.
The Reaction of Offensive Intrusion Set Operators Is Likely to be
Shaped in Part by the Available Capabilities Inventory that
Remains at Their Disposal Following CCO Impact
The depth of this magazine, and its quality, dictates options available to
reacquire access, as well as the relative manner of employment in an
immediate crisis. Beyond the immediate magazine, set reactions will likely be
shaped by comparative capacity to retool new offensive capabilities within
relevant timeframes of the crisis. The responsiveness and quality of the
quartermaster—whether for organic capabilities development, or for contract
or gray/black market acquisitions—will almost certainly factor into service
and national leadership thinking when forced to confront sudden loss of
espionage access or prepositioned offensive options.
Set Reactions Are also Highly Likely to be Shaped by the
Experience of the Operators and Planners
Veteran actors will have previously encountered the inevitable setbacks that
come with any operations in contact with an actively defended target
network. Experienced teams will be familiar with the operational frictions
imposed by routinely changing enterprise and operational technology
environments, and will have previously gone through positional losses—
including those that will dictate requirements for retooling and restoration of
initial intrusion footholds. As a result, they are less likely to react out of
emotion, or paranoia, and more likely to be deliberate in ways that are less
escalatory unless deliberately directed by leadership. It is, however, the
challenges of management, oversight, and overall program direction that may
continue to pose risks in such a scenario. More senior decisionmakers may be
AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

PERSPECTIVE

unlikely to have the same degree of understanding, nor the same prior
experiences, as the technical-level operators. The management of offensive
teams may not always communicate clearly, or well, regarding the character
of specific engagements within ongoing campaigns. This disconnect between
what occurs on the wire, and how leadership makes sense of these events,
poses the potential for miscalculation. This is further exacerbated by power
distance dynamics between line operations elements and service or national
leadership components, as well as a variety of command information channel
problems. Many of these issues are familiar from other military domains,
with disastrous outcomes noted in the historical record that offer substantial
lessons here.57
Intrusion Set Reactions Are also Likely to be Shaped by the
Degree of Overall Crisis Pressure
Both uniqueness of, and immediacy of loss, in impacted capabilities may be
felt more keenly. One can outline a variety of scenarios in which essential
elements of information, or prepositioned ability to hold at risk schwerpunkt
or systempunkt nodes, were sought in requirements serviced by offensive
cyber operations—but where such targets are less amenable to actions
through classic clandestine espionage, national technical means of intelligence
collection, or direct action.58 Losses of capability in crisis are more likely to
be seen as imposing grave risks where cyber options have taken on more
prominent importance—whether due to paucity of human intelligence assets,
lack of effective traditional signals intelligence options in radio frequency
spectrum or public switched telephone networks, or limited utility of IMINT
and other geospatial intelligence capabilities.
The Degree of Publicity Attending CCO Will Likely Influence
Adversary Reaction
It is counterintuitive, but the more publicly that an intrusion set is burned the
less likely it may be considered an immediate risk of escalation. Rational
states are unlikely to focus on political jockeying over public perceptions of
mere espionage where the intent is to engage in higher-order conflict, given
the availability and utility of other better understood instruments for
signaling—including military posture changes. While it is possible a state may
attempt to leverage a very public intrusion incident as casus belli justification
for kinetic retaliation or other options further along the escalation ladder,
such a course of action necessarily involves steps that are distinct from the
countercyber operations maneuver. These other measures may be
distinguished from those in and through the networked environment, and
considered through classic international relations concepts.
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE

PERSPECTIVE

FROM PROPOSITIONS TO CONCLUSIONS
The identification of stability degrading or potentially escalatory factors in
crisis interactions is not intended to argue generally against the conduct of
CCO. It is unrealistic to assume any state will simply permit an adversary
unfettered access to sensitive systems and networks, nor to rely solely on
passive defensive options in challenging extant footholds or ongoing attempts
to acquire new access. However, these factors should indeed be considered by
potential planners and the management and oversight structures that approve
new countercyber concepts of operations. If the above-noted propositions
hold true, minimization of potential flareback and associated unintended
consequences may be sought through deliberate choices in operational design
and execution. Such planning considerations include the following principles:
Extended corrosive degradation of adversary offensive capabilities under
CCO pressure over time, as opposed to a sharp, immediate intervention, is
anticipated to be less likely to provoke escalatory or other retaliatory actions.
The extended attrition of capabilities removes from the equation the elements
that may lead to the perception of catastrophic loss, reducing possible
emotional factors as well as blunting adversary reaction cycles as internal
bureaucratic processes are forced to repeatedly iterate through decision cycles
around each progressive stage of degradation. This is magnified where the
adversary may become aware of differing elements of attrition at varying
points in time, with incomplete or even conflicting information about the
events in question.
CCO effects executed through multiple causal mechanisms may be
presumed to reduce chances of potential destabilizing outcomes. Single
interventions are more likely to be identified by adversaries and give rise to
negative reactions. Therefore, CCO executed through multiple mechanisms
that vary in effect, scope, and timing (even if relatively closely sequenced)
may corrode adversary capability and capacity without the adversary fully
understanding the campaign as a distinct event that may spark retaliatory or
escalatory response.
CCO may be further planned as shaping operations, where selective denial
of adversary capabilities under specific circumstances serves to degrade
overall offensive effectiveness, in order to protect specific higher value
defender equities. Where an adversary may expect and understand countering
as a single decisive action, the intermittent failure of attempted actions under
differing conditions may be indistinguishable from normal operational
friction for some time. Selective denial may also serve to help manage how
and through what means an adversary reaction in and through cyberspace
may play out, where countering planners may deliberately leave untouched
some aspects of an adversary’s offensive architecture, thereby making it more
likely that hostile operators and their leadership will rely on this remaining
AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

PERSPECTIVE

capability in any retaliatory or escalatory response. This will in turn allow
countering mission forces early warning of potential negative reactions, and
the ability to blunt retaliatory impact. These concepts have recently gained
traction within U.S. and allied Intelligence Community circles, particularly
where outcomes are considered as an alternative to strategic objectives of
deterrence.59
Deliberate deception and offensive counterintelligence options, distinct
from but executed in coordination with CCO, may mitigate negative
adversary reactions. Adversary threat activity groups of significance largely
involve military and intelligence service organizations and their contractor or
proxy assets. Where a sustained CCO campaign is ongoing over a distinct
period of time, the ability of the adversary to recognize such pressure may be
deliberately complicated by the introduction of deliberately misleading or
ambiguous information into known collection channels. Penetration of
hostile intelligence organizations may also be leveraged to delay assessment
processes or even blunt the conclusions of such assessments by mishandling
operational data or altering analytic judgment. Even where such options are
not possible, a countering planner may seek to provoke internal responses
designed to enhance adversary paranoia, and degrade operations efficiency
due to the imposition of new operations security or personal/political
reliability controls. An adversary inwardly focused after a major loss to CCO
action may be presumed to be less likely to retaliate or escalate externally.
Third party actions by allies, partners, industry asset owners, or
commercial intelligence services may help avoid negative outcomes. The
separation of the mechanism of perceived impact from CCO action will likely
change the adversary calculus of reaction, especially where it depolarizes a
strictly bilateral conflict and presents the adversary with a multilateral
problem space. However, such partnering need not entirely rule out or even
limit unilateral CCO actions, but merely inform the timing and manner in
which these operations are conducted when considered within the larger
framework of relationships facing a crisis. The benefits of third-party action
may naturally emerge from well-coordinated CCO engagement where the
equities of these additional players are taken into account, and especially
where CCO fits as one element within a wider defensive and countering
campaign leveraging all instruments of national power.
The requirement to consider CCO and their potential consequences in this
manner is more than somewhat novel for analysts, academics, and
policymakers alike. CCO actions are driven by technical and tactical factors
that nonetheless may result in what are essentially strategic interactions. Such
interactions have been reserved previously for only a select few national
capabilities. This demands greater focus and attention to the operational art
involved, in order to illuminate differing employment scenarios, estimate

adversary reactions, and understand higher order effects stemming from
events in the domain. Evaluation of these factors in the context of such cases
offers utility for future operations planning, indications and warning analysis,
as well as simulation and wargaming evaluation.
Escalation risks are neither absolute nor preordained outcomes, and are
likely highly sensitive to specific tactical and operational conditions shaped
by specific facts “on the wire.” Decisionmakers must remain wary of the
specific scenarios under which escalation may be more likely due to unique
sensitivities and through previously recognized dynamics. Yet there almost
certainly remains a robust engagement space within which CCO actions may
be conducted in a manner that minimizes chances of error, misinterpretation,
and subsequent escalation. However, there are likely hitherto unanticipated
implications for strategic stability—even as it remains further likely that
repeated interactions to reset conditions of security and insecurity will over
time reduce the strategic weight of specific campaigns, as both sides become
better accustomed to implicit grammar, and tacit boundaries, of what may be
seen as reasonable actions to contest ongoing espionage and other hostile
access to critical systems and networks.
