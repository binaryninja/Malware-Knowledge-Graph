Main
incidents in
the EU and
worldwide
ENISA Threat Landscape

Overview
The sophistication of threat capabilities increased in 2019, with
many adversaries using exploits, credential stealing, and multistage attacks. The number of data breach incidents is still very high,
and the amount of stolen financial information and user credentials is
growing. In some cases, the failure to patch a known vulnerability that
has the potential to affect software or libraries in use - in a reasonable
timeframe – may have serious repercussions.
During the past decade, malware has made ENISA’s list of top 15
threats, yet still many security systems are not able to detect this
threat. For many years, malware was spread mainly through malicious
e-mail spam and more recently, using finely crafted phishing messages.
Technology companies and e-mail providers alike invested in spam
filters, improving the detection of malicious attachments. However,
adversaries are now innovating to increase their chances of
reaching potential victims. Many of these innovations have paid back
to malicious actors during this period.
The COVID-19 pandemic has put healthcare organisations and
professionals worldwide under pressure, and health has become one of
the most critical sectors to protect against cyberattacks. The number of
incidents involving ransomware targeting the healthcare sector was
already high but increased during the pandemic.

Most targeted sectors
_In the line of fire
The sectors most targeted sectors during this period were digital
services, government administration and the technology industry.
Attacks on digital service providers often serve as proxies to reach other,
more attractive targets. In contrast, attacks on the technology industry
allowed malicious actors to compromise the supply chain or look for

vulnerabilities to exploit.
The e-mail platform verifications.io18, suffered a major data breach due
to an unprotected MongoDB database. Data from over 800 million emails were exposed, containing sensitive information that included
personally identifiable information (PII).
Over 770 million e-mail addresses and 21 million unique passwords
were exposed in a popular hacking forum hosted by the cloud service
MEGA1. It became the most significant collection of breached personal
credentials in history, named ‘Collection #1’.
The cloud and virtualisation provider Citrix was a victim of a targeted
cyberattack. To gain access to Citrix’s systems, the attackers exploited
several critical software vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-19781 and
employed a technique called password spraying.
The cloud hosting provider iNSYNQ19 experienced a ransomware attack
that left customers unable to access their data for more than a week,
forcing customers to rely on local backups.

6

__Most targeted sectors
Digital Services_ Services such as e-mail, social and
collaborative platforms and cloud providers were under attack
during 2019. These were also used as proxies for further attacks.

Government Administration_ The financial
returns from ransoms paid makes the public sector one of the
most attractive targets for ransomware attacks.

Technology Industry_ The technology industry
was under attack in 2019 mainly through supply chain attacks
trying to compromise the development of software through zeroday exploits and backdoors attacks.

Financial_ The number of incidents with financial
organisations and not necessarily banks, increased substantially
during the reporting period.

Healthcare_ The number of attacks against the
healthcare sector continues to grow.

7

Trends
_Across the board
 In 2019, intense trojan-activity was observed across the globe.
Emotet and Agent Tesla were the most frequently and dangerous
malwares .
 Phishing remained one of the most successful techniques for
delivering malicious tools. Powerful phishing lures include phone
scams, fake invoices, payments, quotations and purchase and sales
orders.
 Ransomware continues to generate substantial financial rewards for
malicious actors. A recent study identified human-operated

ransomware campaigns17, in which adversaries employ credential
theft and lateral movement methods traditionally associated with
targeted attacks such as those from nation-state actors.
 Card-skimming schemes have become a significant threat during
2019 and 2020 due to the increasing number of online shoppers.
 Business e-mail compromise (BEC) is a growing threat as a result of
the vast amount of credentials and personal information stolen

during the last decade.
 Companies experience an average of 12 credential-stuffing attacks
each month, wherein the attacker is able to identify valid credentials.

Actors
_Who
Knowing who is responsible or attributing responsibilities to a person or
a group for a cybersecurity incident is still a very daunting task and often
a worthless exercise. Yet, from a threat intelligence perspective, it is
essential to classify behaviours, understand the dynamics and modus
operandi used by certain adversaries. This analysis often helps
defenders to look for specific tracks and try to anticipate the next
adversarial action.

The Lazarus Group for example, an allegedly state-sponsored advanced
persistent threat (APT) group, was reportedly more active during the
reporting period in both financially and espionage motivated attacks.
The group has been associated with several incidents, including the
AppleJeus campaign targeting cryptocurrency trading platform users
and their systems.22 Major incidents attributed to this group include:
 hacking an Indian nuclear power plant and space research
organisation in November 2019;
 compromising a cryptocurrency trading app targeting exchange
administrators in October 2019;
 attacking automated teller machines (ATMs) and banks in India,
identified in September 2019;
 targeting Android users in South Korea through trojanised apps in the
Google Play Store identified in August 2019.

10

__Most active actors
TURLA_ The group was reported to have targeted Microsoft
Exchange e-mail servers in the education, government, military,
research, and pharmaceutical sectors in more than 40 countries in
23
2019.

APT27_ The group was reported to have compromised
government organisations’ SharePoint servers in two different
countries in the Middle East.

VICIOUS PANDA_ In April 2020, the Mongolian Public
Administration was allegedly targeted by the group.

Motivations
_Why
While it is challenging to determine the primary motivation behind a
cyberattack, we can still categorise them based on the outcome of the
incident.
Financial: The number of incidents resulting in the theft of information,
data and user credentials is the highest observed during the reporting
period. In most cases, the intention is to steal data/information and sell
it on the dark web. Other uses of this information/data to enable other
types of attacks with a completely different outcome such as espionage
or financial fraud, can also be identified. More than 620 million account
details were stolen from 16 hacked websites and offered for sale on the
popular dark-web marketplace Dream Market.
Espionage: This is a motive behind an increasing number of reported
attacks, mainly due to ongoing geopolitical and commercial tensions.
The number of incidents is not substantial, but their size and magnitude
put it second in ENISA’s list of top 5 motivations. Some noteworthy
incidents include that reported in April 2019, in which a General Electric’s
employee and a Chinese businessperson were charged by the United
States Department of Justice with economic espionage and theft of
General Electric’s trade secrets.20 AgenceFrance Presse (AFP) reported
that Airbus had fallen victim to a sophisticated cyber-espionage
campaign. Attackers reportedly breached the IT systems of several of
Airbus’s suppliers and, from there, penetrated the company’s IT
systems.21

Top five motivations: financial, espionage, disruption,
political and retaliation.

12

__Top motivations
The figure below shows that Financial is still the primary motive
for the majority of cyberattacks. In some cases, multiple
motivations can be identified within a single attack. For example,
espionage, political, financial and disruption are often combined
motives. Many incidents originate from automated systems and
are delivered ‘as-a-service’, paid in cryptocurrency. These services
include distribution of ransomware, command and control (C2),
distributed denial of service (DDoS), spam and other illicit
activities.

Attack vectors
_How
Cyberattacks take on average three steps to reach a victim’s valuable
assets. When reviewing the most frequently used attack vectors, we
must prioritise the entry point, course of action and action on assets.
These are the most critical stages that should constitute distinct
approaches in a defence strategy.
Entry point: During 2019, the techniques used most frequently to start
a cyberattack include brute force with stolen credentials, social
engineering, configuration errors and exploitation of web applications.
The exploitation of web applications, for example, was often used as an
entry point because of the growing uptake of this type of application to
transfer data to the cloud. Errors in cloud configuration and misuse of
systems were essential entry point in a large number of incidents. The
use of social engineering to plan an attack leverages from tools such as
phishing and business e-mail compromise (BEC)16. Other techniques less
frequently but equally important are the exploitation of vulnerabilities
(from unpatched systems and zero-days) and software backdoors, often
used in more complex and sophisticated attacks.
Course of action: Installing malware is the technique most widely used
during the ‘course of action’ stage. Once installed, it helps the adversary
to do reconnaissance, move around the victim’s systems and networks,
install additional tools such as ransomware, steal data and communicate
with a C2 server.

14

__Five most desired assets by
cybercriminals
01_Industrial property and trade secrets
Industrial property and trade secrets are the most desirable assets
because of their high value to their owners, the market and some cases
the criminal world.

02_State/military classified information
This asset includes any information that a state deems sensitive. In
2019, the trade and diplomatic tensions between countries made this
type of information even more attractive.

03_Server infrastructure
Server infrastructure is the first sensitive asset that is not data. In many
attacks, taking over the victim’s server infrastructure, is the primary
objective.

04_Authentication data
Authentication data is valuable assets for generating profits but also as
an objective to support an attack.

05_Financial data
Financial data such as credit card, banking and payment information
is always value to cybercriminals.

15

Strategic intelligence
_What changed in the landscape with the
covid-19 pandemic?
In 2019, ENISA continued mapping the threat landscape, helping
decision-makers and policymakers define strategies to defend citizens,
organisations and cyberspace. This work is part of ENISA’s strategy to

provide strategic intelligence to its stakeholders. The central theme in
2019 was the next generation of mobile telecommunications, or 5G,
following a request from the European Commission and Member States.
The agency will continue to produce these thematic threat
landscapes and in 2020, the focus is on artificial intelligence.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a prolific period for malicious actors
conducting attacks targeting sensitive areas such as healthcare service

providers and people working from home. ENISA is mapping the threat
landscape experienced during the pandemic and advising on mitigation
measures that will attempt to reduce the exposure to threats.
ENISA shares its cybersecurity recommendations on the COVID-19
pandemic on a variety of topics including working remotely, online
shopping and e-health, and it provides valuable up to date security
advice to the sectors affected.32

The Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic suffered a
cyberattack33 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced it to
reroute patients and postpone surgery. The incident is considered
critical since this Hospital is one of the Czech Republic's biggest COVID19 testing laboratories.

16

_COVID-19 threat landscape
ENISA prepared many resources for an awareness-raising campaign and
shared other internal and external resources dedicated to cybersecurity
experts, covering security issues associated with challenges faced during
the COVID-19 pandemic. One of these resources was an analysis of the
most critical threats during this period.
