CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Scope Note: Recorded Future’s Insikt Group analyzed network indicators of compromise
and TTPs relating to an intrusion incident targeting a U.K.-based engineering company.
Sources include Recorded Future’s product, VirusTotal, ReversingLabs, DomainTools
Iris, and PassiveTotal, along with third-party metadata and common OSINT techniques.
This report will be of greatest interest to organizations within the high-tech engineering
industries in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, as well as those investigating Chinese statesponsored cyberespionage.

Executive Summary
Employees of a U.K.-based engineering company were among the
targeted victims of a spearphishing campaign in early July 2018.
The campaign also targeted an email address possibly belonging
to a freelance journalist based in Cambodia who covers Cambodian
politics, human rights, and Chinese development. We believe both
attacks used the same infrastructure as a reported campaign by
Chinese threat actor TEMP.Periscope (also known as Leviathan),
which targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to their July 2018
elections. Crucially, TEMP.Periscope’s interest in the U.K. engineering
company they targeted dates back to attempted intrusions in May
2017.
Based on the available data and evidence outlined in this report,
Recorded Future assesses with medium confidence that Chinese
threat actor TEMP.Periscope reused publicly reported, sophisticated
TTPs from Russian threat groups Dragonfly and APT28 to target
the U.K. engineering company, likely to gain access to sensitive
and proprietary technologies and data. We believe TEMP.Periscope
reused published TTPs either to increase the group’s chances
of success in gaining access to the victim network or to evade
attribution by laying false flags to confuse researchers.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Timeline of selected APT28, Dragonfly, and TEMP.Periscope TTP disclosures and activity.

Key Judgments
• Attackers likely used a command and control (C2) domain,
scsnewstoday[.]com, that was identified in a recent
TEMP.Periscope campaign targeting the
Cambodian government.
• The attackers used a Chinese email client, Foxmail, to send
the spearphishing attack.
• A unique technique documented as a Dragonfly TTP in
targeting critical infrastructure was used in the attack. The
technique attempts to acquire SMB credentials using a “file://”
path in the spearphish calling out to a malicious C2.
• The attack probably made use of a version of the open
source tool Responder as an NBT-NS poisoner. APT28 used
Responder in attacks against travelers staying at hotels in
2017.
• The U.K. engineering company was previously targeted by
TEMP.Periscope in a May 2017 campaign with the same C2
infrastructure that was used in targeting U.S. engineering
and academic entities later in September 2017, as detailed in
Proofpoint’s Leviathan report.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Background
TEMP.Periscope is a state-sponsored Chinese threat actor that first
came to public prominence in October 2017, when reports surfaced
about a group called Leviathan. Leviathan used a combination of
unique and open source tooling to target the maritime and defense
industries for espionage purposes. The report detailed coverage of
the group dating back to at least 2014.
Reporting emerged months later highlighting further activity
against the maritime and defense sectors that mainly targeted
companies in the U.S. and Europe and included more details on the
group’s TTPs. The activity was tagged with a new threat actor name,
TEMP.Periscope, but the report authors noted that Leviathan and
TEMP.Periscope were the same group.
The increased targeting of high-tech marine engineering entities
coincided with the growing regional tensions surrounding
China’s claims for much of the South China Sea (SCS) territory.
Chinese cyberespionage targeting countries neighboring the
South China Sea continued to escalate in 2018, with reports of
TEMP.Periscope targeting Cambodia ahead of their July 2018
elections. Additionally, attacks such as the one uncovered against a
U.S. Navy contractor in early 2018, resulting in the theft of a massive
amount of highly sensitive data that included plans to develop a
submarine-based, supersonic anti-ship missile, demonstrate China’s
continued targeting of cutting-edge naval technology to bridge the
technological gap with the U.S.

The Infection Vector
The attempted intrusion we studied targeted the network of a U.K.
company that provides specialist engineering solutions. The U.K.
engineering company shared details of the attempted spearphish

Email headers revealed that the spearphish was sent on July 6,
2018 at 9:30 AM UTC, via Foxmail. Foxmail is a freeware email client
developed by Tencent, one of the three largest internet services
companies in China. Foxmail boasts over three million daily users in
China and has previously been associated with Chinese APT activity.
In addition to email addresses belonging to the U.K. engineering
company’s employees, the same spearphish was also sent to an
email address possibly belonging to a journalist based in Cambodia.
The sender account, melissa.coade[at]yahoo[.]com, was spoofing
Australian journalist and lawyer Melissa Coade, who among other
things writes about Cambodian civil and social matters and has
written for the Phnom Penh Post.
In a spearphishing campaign targeting the Cambodian elections
in July 2018, Chinese threat actor TEMP.Periscope spoofed the
sender address and impersonated a worker from a Cambodian
nongovernmental organization (NGO).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Snippet of a spearphish email shared by the targeted U.K. engineering company.

The email contained two malicious links. The first, a “file://” link,
if clicked, would generate an SMB session. The second link was
to a .url file that was also configured to create an outbound SMB
connection.
The threat actor masqueraded as a Cambodian reporter requesting
further information from the victim to be uploaded to her “report
website.” However, spelling and punctuation errors in the message
alerted network defenders at the victim organization.
Our analysis of the metadata contained within the email header
and a subsequent controlled interaction with the file share over
SMB revealed several interesting characteristics of the attempted
intrusion.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Responder: The “NetBIOS Poisoner”
First, we analyzed the SMB file path link. We observed the hostname
WIN-PRH492RQAFV on C2 82.118.242[.]243 when it attempted to
acquire SMB credentials from the victim network. We then noted
the hostname WIN-PRH492RQAFV was hardcoded within several
forked versions of a Python hacktool called Responder on GitHub.
One version of Responder with this hostname was found in a
build of P4wnP11 that was uploaded to BeeBin, a free file upload
service, and another version with the same hostname was found
within PiBunny.
P4wnP1 is a highly customizable USB attack platform based on a Raspberry Pi Zero
computer.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Responder was released in January 2014. It is described as follows in
its README file listed on the official GitHub repository: “Responder
is an LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoner. It will answer to specific
NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name suffix
(see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409). By default, the tool
will only answer to File Server Service request, which is for SMB.
The concept behind this is to target our answers, and be stealthier
on the network …”
Malicious use of Responder was first publicly documented on
August 11, 2017 as being used by APT28, also known as Fancy
Bear. The tool was used against hotel visitors to spoof NetBios
resources. Victims were coerced into connecting to UDP port 137
and disclosing credentials over SMB to APT28, which the threat
actor then used to gain elevated access to the network.
More Lessons From Russia: SMB Credential Harvesting Using
“file://” Path
Building on the use of Responder, the threat actor also appeared
to borrow techniques originating from a different Russian threat
actor, Dragonfly, also known as Energetic Bear or Crouching Yeti.
The path “file://82.118.242[.]243/[REDACTED]” used in the spearphish
was likely to steal SMB credentials by creating an invisible image tag
that the host attempts to fetch over SMB, while giving the attackers
a hashed value of the user's NTLM password. When executing the
code, the browser creates an invisible image tag and sets the URL
to an attack server using the “file://” protocol scheme, which also
transmits the user’s login NTLM hash. This created an effective
watering hole to fingerprint potential victims and gather credentials
for subsequent incursions into target networks.
This technique of leveraging the “file://” path to trigger an SMB
connection was first publicly detailed by US-CERT on March 15, 2018
as a sophisticated technique used by Russian government actors
believed to be the Dragonfly threat actor, targeting the energy
industry and other critical infrastructure sectors.

WHOIS referenced the IP within a massive range registered to the
U.K. ISP Virgin Media (82.0.0.0 - 82.47.255.255). However, MaxMind
resolved the IP to Bulgarian hosting provider Histate Global Corp.
Based on the listed vulnerabilities in Shodan and scan results for the

Vulnerabilities likely associated with 82.118.242[.]243.

Another IP address that falls within the same /24 CIDR range,
82.118.242[.]124, was flagged in Recorded Future with an abnormally
high risk score of 89 in July 2018. This was due to the IP appearing
in the IOC listing by Cisco Talos as second-stage malware associated
with the VPNFilter botnet. This botnet has been attributed to APT28
by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Based on the vulnerability of the web server 82.118.242[.]243 and
the use of the “file://” SMB credential stealing technique directing
the victim to the IP, we believe the threat actor compromised the
web server and used it as a targeted watering hole to illicitly acquire
SMB credentials from victims during this campaign.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

WIN-AB2I27TG6FK and Chinese Threat Actor TEMP.Periscope
Hostname WIN-AB2I27TG6FK was observed as the NetBios server
name of the device sending the spearphish from the VPN IP
193.180.255[.]2.
Open source research for the hostname WIN-AB2I27TG6FK revealed
an open directory (Google cached link) at the URL scsnewstoday[.]
com/news/ that hosted several files containing the hostname in
the filename (see snapshot of the domain below). The domain
was previously reported as a C2 used by the Chinese threat actor
TEMP.Periscope to deliver their AIRBREAK downloader. AIRBREAK,
also known as Orz, is a JavaScript-based backdoor that retrieves
commands from hidden strings in compromised webpages and
actor-controlled profiles on legitimate services.

File listing on an open directory hosted at http://scsnewstoday[.]com/news.

In addition to AIRBREAK, the scsnewstoday C2 server reportedly
hosted other malware and logs relating to TEMP.Periscope
malicious activity that targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to
the country’s elections. The spearphish against the U.K. engineering
company occurred at the same time this campaign was active —
in early July 2018. Judging from the naming convention employed
on filenames in the open directory, C2S and S2C likely relate to
client-to-server and server-to-client connections with the hostname
WIN-AB2I27TG6FK, which we assess is likely to be the hostname
associated with the scsnewstoday[.]com C2. We’d expect to see
many more files listed if the hostnames in the filenames related to
the clients, or victims, targeted by TEMP.Periscope.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1113 | 9

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The domain scsnewstoday[.]com was hosted on U.S. IP 68.65.123[.]230
and registered to domain hosting service Namecheap until July 11,
2018. Details of the C2 domain were published just a day earlier,
which we believe may have unnerved TEMP.Periscope operators,
resulting in it being dropped. Unfortunately, the open directory is
no longer accessible, which hampered our ability to understand the
precise nature of the three files containing the WIN-AB2I27TG6FK
hostname.
According to industry reporting, Chinese espionage group
TEMP.Periscope has conducted large-scale phishing, intrusion,
remote access trojan (RAT), and data exfiltration activity since at
least 2013. Targeting has primarily focused on maritime-related
entities across multiple industries, including engineering, shipping
and transportation, manufacturing, defense, government offices,
and research universities. However, the group has also targeted
professional and consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare,
and media and publishing.
Originating IP for Spearphish 193.180.255[.]2
This IP appeared in the email header information as the X-ForwardedFor IP, indicating that it was the originating IP address for the
sender of the spearphish. WHOIS registration data revealed that
193.180.255[.]2 is registered to Privat Kommunikation Sverige AB,
which is the full company name of PrivateVPN, a popular commercial
VPN service. The company states that they support OpenVPN over
TCP/UDP, L2TP, IPSEC, PPTP, and IKEv2 protocols.
Recorded Future identified three VPN connections involving the
193.180.255[.]2 IP between June 30 and July 1, 2018. All three
connections were over UDP 500 (IKE/IKEv2), originating from
Bangladesh IP 103.198.138[.]187.
Additionally, between July 3 and July 10, 2018, 193.180.255[.]2
established SSH (TCP 22), NetBios (TCP 139), and Microsoft SMB
(TCP 445) connections to the malicious SMB credential harvesting
C2 82.118.242[.]243. Interestingly, these connections took place
during the seven-day window within which the spearphish was sent.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Historic Targeting of U.K. Engineering Company by
TEMP.Periscope
Prior to this attempt in July, the same U.K. engineering company
had previously been targeted in May 2017. This campaign used the
ETERNALBLUE exploit and a unique DNS tunneler backdoor. The DNS
tunneler used in the attack was configured to communicate with a
subdomain of thyssenkrupp-marinesystems[.]org. The domain was
clearly spoofing German defense contractor ThyssenKrupp Marine
Systems, which specializes in marine engineering. In addition to
hosting the spoofed domain, Netherlands-based HostSailor VPS
IP 185.106.120[.]206 also hosted an open directory containing
malware and tools for use by the threat actor, not dissimilar to the
TEMP.Periscope scsnewstoday[.]com C2 and open directory set up.
Recorded Future analysis on the spoofed domain revealed
that this server hosted the SeDll Javascript loader SHA256:
146aa9a0ec013aa5bdba9ea9d29f59d48d43bc17c6a20b7
4bb8c521dbb5bc6f4, which had been used in August 2017 by
Leviathan (also known as TEMP.Periscope) to execute another
Javascript backdoor, AIRBREAK. Crucially, the first mention of
Leviathan as a Chinese threat actor occurred in October 2017,
meaning TEMP.Periscope was using the same infrastructure to
target the U.K. engineering company six months earlier.
In November 2017, another spearphish leveraging Microsoft
Equation Editor vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 was sent to the U.K.
engineering company. This attack delivered a Cobalt Strike payload.

Conclusions and Outlook
The attempted spearphish has revealed a suite of TTPs that are
linked to the recent activities of several different threat actors:
APT28, Dragonfly, and TEMP.Periscope. We have listed the key TTPs
observed in this attack in a chronological format in order to draw
attention to the likelihood of techniques being copied from publicly
disclosed reporting of these TTPs. These are summarized in the

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Given that most of the listed APT28, Dragonfly, and TEMP.Periscope
TTPs have already been published, we believe there are three likely
scenarios for the activity observed:
1. A Russian threat actor was responsible and borrowed
TEMP.Periscope TTPs.
2. TEMP.Periscope was responsible and borrowed Russian
threat actor TTPs.
3. Another threat actor was responsible that used TTPs from the
Russian groups and TEMP.Periscope.
In order to assess which of the three hypotheses above best explains
our observations, we assessed the accumulated evidence detailed
in this report.
First, we are certain that the attacker used IP 193.180.255[.]2 as
a VPN endpoint to send the spearphish because the IP address
resolves to Swedish VPN service PrivateVPN. We are also certain that
the device that sent the spearphish was associated with the WINAB2I27TG6FK hostname. Further, we can state that this hostname
was used in the filename of several files hosted on a known
TEMP.Periscope C2, which had an open directory. As outlined
earlier in this report, we believe the sender of the spearphish, WINAB2I27TG6FK, is probably the hostname of the TEMP.Periscope
open directory hosted at scsnewstoday[.]com.
The spearphish was sent on July 6, 2018. Just a few days later,
FireEye reported on a TEMP.Periscope campaign targeting the
Cambodian elections in July 2018 that used the open directory
hosted on scsnewstoday[.]com as a C2. The report noted that the
same infrastructure was likely active since at least April 2017.
Secondly, the “file://” path included in the spearphish linking to the
C2 82.118.242[.]243 was designed to steal credentials over SMB.
This technique was documented publicly as a Dragonfly threat actor
TTP by the US-CERT in March 2018, almost four months before the
observed attack.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1113 | 13

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The observed hostname on the 82.118.242[.]243 IP was WINPRH492RQAFV, which we found was hard coded in a forked
Responder script on GitHub. The original Responder script has
previously been used by another Russian threat actor, APT28,
according to reporting published in August 2017.

Timeline of selected APT28, Dragonfly, and TEMP.Periscope TTP disclosures and activity.

TEMP.Periscope has been actively followed by the research
community since at least October 2017 — two months after APT28’s
use of Responder was disclosed by FireEye in August 2017.2 There
has since been a flurry of reporting on TEMP.Periscope activity in
2018, with campaigns against American and European maritime
engineering companies and the Cambodian government. We
should note here that the spearphish we observed was also sent
to an email account that contained the name of a journalist based
in Cambodia and was sent from an account spoofing an Australian
journalist that had previously reported on Cambodian topics.

F-Secure published research in August 2016 on their investigations into the NanHaiShu
RAT, which has since been attributed to TEMP.Periscope (Leviathan).

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1113 | 14

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Therefore, it is plausible that, with the timeline of Russian tooling
being made public prior to the disclosure of the TEMP.Periscope
campaigns, TEMP.Periscope adapted their TTPs to either hinder
attribution efforts or to simply use techniques that they deemed
would be effective.
The overlap in infrastructure with the scsnewstoday[.]com C2
domain is also key; the domain was publicly reported by FireEye as
being used by TEMP.Periscope only a few days after the spearphish
to the U.K. engineering company was sent, making it highly
unlikely that another threat actor could have compromised the
C2. Additionally, the longer-term targeting of the U.K. engineering
company by TEMP.Periscope since at least May 2017 highlights the
group’s persistence in attempting to gain access.
Based on the available data and evidence outlined in this report,
Recorded Future assesses with medium confidence that Chinese
threat actor TEMP.Periscope reused TTPs from other threat groups
to target the U.K. engineering company, likely to gain access to their
sensitive and proprietary technologies and data. TEMP.Periscope
has demonstrated an ability to rapidly adapt its TTPs to learn from
other groups, such as APT28 and Dragonfly, either to increase their
chances of success in gaining access to the victim network or to
obfuscate attribution attempts.
Recorded Future expects TEMP.Periscope to continue to target
organizations in the high-tech defense and engineering sectors. The
Chinese strategic requirement to develop advanced technology,
particularly in marine engineering, remains an intense focus as
China looks to dominate the South China Sea territory. We believe
TEMP.Periscope will continue to use commodity malware because
it is still broadly successful and relatively low cost for them to use.
They will continue to observe “trending” vulnerabilities to exploit
and use techniques that have been publicly reported in order to
gain access to victim networks.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1113 | 15

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Finally, Recorded Future believes that threat actors are actively
emulating each other, monitoring publications and data sources
both to protect their infrastructure and to observe techniques that
rival actors are using. We anticipate that adversaries will continue
to plant false flags, either via technical means (as observed in the
Olympic Destroyer campaign) or with technique emulation. As means
of detection have drastically improved, the public identification of
code overlap and the mapping of TTPs plays into the hands of wellcoordinated operations, which can now make attribution findings
murky at best. The samples and techniques named in a report can
now rapidly be transposed into new or ongoing campaigns due to
the volume of public reporting on these issues. This muddying of
the waters allows targeted campaigns to better blend in with the
noise, attempting to blur the lines between adversary groups.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Network Defense Recommendations
Recorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following
measures when defending against TEMP.Periscope’s attempts to
steal credentials to gain network access:
• Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion
prevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms
in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking
illicit connection attempts from — the external IP addresses
and domains listed in Appendix A.
• Include the provided Snort rules in Appendix B in IDS and IPS
appliances to detect attempted SMB credential stealing. Also,
if applicable, use the provided Bro queries in Appendix B to
hunt for signs of TEMP.Periscope TTPs detailed in this report
on your network.
• Use Recorded Future’s API to import indicators listed in
this report (Appendix A) into your endpoint detection and
response (EDR) platform.
• Configure endpoint detection and response traffic to alert and
block connections to indicators in Appendix A.
• Utilize the provided Yara rule in Appendix C to search your
network for evidence of the spearphish being sent to your
organization.
• Monitor and restrict SMB traffic across your network,
particularly external attempts to authenticate via SMB.
