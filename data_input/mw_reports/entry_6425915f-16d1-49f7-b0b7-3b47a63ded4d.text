REvil: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses

July 28, 2021

Until the 13th of July, 2021, things appeared to be going as expected with the threat actors
behind REvil (AKA Sodinokibi) ransomware. Then, suddenly, the fairly public group
vanished. With them disappeared their notorious “Happy Blog,” payment page, and other
infrastructure that supported their ransomware and extortion operations. That same day, their
primary representative was banned on the popular Russian-language forum XSS where
they’d been a fixture since the inception of their brand of ransomware.
Today, there is still a lot of speculation on the whereabouts of REvil, and many great minds
have some pretty informed hot takes.
Was it…
Law enforcement?
A rebrand?
Too much notoriety?
Take the money and run?
Since there’s been no official conclusion to this story, we at Digital Shadows performed the
ancient intelligence ritual known as the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) to see
all the perspectives around specific events and moments that may help shed light on a most
likely outcome.
Spoiler alert: We’re still not entirely sure. Also, this is still just, like, our opinion, man, so
please take it with a grain of salt.

What is an ACH?
An analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) is typically a tabletop exercise that gathers
intelligence analysts in a dark, smoke-filled room or a cave for hours to days at a time for a
reasoned discussion. Much of the talk is usually based on what we’ve seen or learned over
time about this particular actor, which includes our observations, as well as outsiders’. With
an ACH, it’s not about the most correct hypothesis, as all hypotheses hold the same weight;
it’s about which one(s) you might be able to prove.
Without further ado, let’s dive into our six “competing” hypotheses belo

Hypothesis 1: Law Enforcement Action
This scenario so far is one of the top contenders, mainly because there is so much
convincing evidence that points to law enforcement action:
Point: Speed of site outage
For starters, the speed at which all of the sites went down. It’s not uncommon for actors to
run into technical problems, either because of Tor’s limitations or an unforeseen application
or coding issue. The fact that everything was gone so quickly and seemingly under cover of
darkness seemed different.
Not to mention, REvil’s sites were observed to be more stable than most, so an outage
lasting longer than 24 hours was a little out of character for the group. When you consider
that “Unknown,” their forum representative, was banned on the same day, it also lends some
credence to the theory. Typically, forum bans are not to be taken lightly. Bans are rarely done
2/9

by request and usually occur because of some arbitration issue. The user was called out for
being suspicious, or there’s a question of law enforcement having access to a forum
persona.
Point: Increased government rhetoric
Second, there’s a combination of public factors that also contribute to this outcome. In the
wake of the G7 summit, there was a PR-like Russian media release where the Russian FSB
director stated he was ready to work with US law enforcement in the struggle with
ransomware.
Coincidentally, the Biden administration and various government agencies stepped up
rhetoric particularly against ransomware, which would be seen more as a terrorist attack if
performed against critical infrastructure. There were also calls in the media to involve the
intelligence community because of the aforementioned tougher stance on ransomware.
Point: Removal of REvil branding
Finally, in the underground itself, the actor behind Prometheus ransomware broadcast their
affiliation with REvil until the week they went silent. The newest branding for Prometheus
removed any mentions of REvil, and they have historically been one of the more staunch
affiliates with REvil.

How it started (top), and how it’s going (bottom) with

Prometheus and REvil.
REvil themselves have never been shy in the spotlight. In the aftermath of Colonial Pipeline,
they openly bragged about how good the business was getting, in terms of money to be
made, as well as the number of affiliates. They also were unconcerned about the forum bans
and rising US pressure and rhetoric. They also removed any restrictions on targets:
Everything was fair game. Talk like that would seem to draw more attention, which does raise
the possibility that maybe a law enforcement organization received their orders after
someone reached the “enough” point.

3/9

Counterpoint: No claimants as of yet
What is working against these theories are a few possibilities. Namely, in the wake of every
significant takedown in recent years, law enforcement also hasn’t been shy to take any
credit. In past operations, we’ve seen government banners plastered across sites when
they’re taken down, public indictments against operators in various courts, and press
releases hitting major outlets.
Several countries outside of the usual US and Five-Eyes axis have had several significant
arrests in recent years, often announcing them as they happen or while the flash-bang
grenades are still cooling off on the ground. That still hasn’t happened. Though the FBI is
notoriously quiet about current operations, they do announce when something big happens.
We knew when the FBI was able to seize funds from the Colonial Incident with DarkSide.
However, REvil’s wallets are still just sitting there. While this could point to a still ongoing
operation or even a more extensive involvement from an intelligence agency,the thought is
something would’ve leaked somewhere by now in 2021.
Verdict: Likely, but some evidence contributes to arguments for other outcomes.

Hypothesis 2: Technical Difficulties
Point: Technical difficulties are commonplace
This theory presents some problems, namely, not having complete insight into the skills and
abilities of the actual REvil operators. Also, not knowing what the entire infrastructure even
looks like may be problematic. It’s realistically possible that even ransomware operators have
shadow IT, or otherwise offsite content and hardware that is separate from the known sites
such as “Happy Blog,” and we may not know all of the forum personas.
Counterpoint: No historical technical issues regarding REvil
We know that, as a general observation, their infrastructure hasn’t had much downtime
compared to others. Any site downtime lasting more than a day just has not been seen often,
much less on all of their known public sites at the same time. Again, this lends weight to the
law enforcement theory, but it could also mean a step back to rebrand or retool.
While there is a possibility that some internal strife or maybe just better job offers elsewhere
for key support personnel caused everything to go down at once, the analyst in me is saying
that there would’ve been a reflection of that somewhere on the forums. People are generally
terrible with secrets, so someone would’ve talked about it by now.
Verdict: Probable but difficult to prove without further insights.

Hypothesis 3: Strife
4/9

Point: Business disagreements increase with more members and affiliates
Have you ever had coworkers or management you couldn’t stand? Or maybe just got tired of
the job or the company? There’s a good chance that ransomware operators go through the
same thing. One of the arguments we’d discussed on the technical difficulties aspect was the
possibility of certain group members leaving to seek their fortunes elsewhere, which would
leave the sites, infrastructure, or any development adrift. Some thoughts about this led to
more of the specific emotions for members and affiliates of the group. Maybe there was a socalled “old guard” who didn’t care for current business practices, or perhaps suspicions of
law enforcement involvement or pressure on other members. Maybe trying to manage the
affiliates on top of all the day-to-day work became too much.
Counterpoint: Respect and arbitration on forums
There is evidence of strife between actors on forums, and REvil was no stranger to this.
Digital Shadows had previously observed some public disagreements with affiliates, as well
as accusations around mismanagement of funds. There were also some open arbitration
cases over time, which in itself is not uncommon on forums. However, these were resolved
around the time of REvil going dark. However, the group has had a decently long tenure and
generally acted quickly to quash instability. There was also a sense of respect on the forums
since they did participate in forum life, which usually involves discussions about other topics
and business outside of ransomware.
Counterpoint: The money is good
Also, in June, there was the aforementioned interview with lots of boasts about business
doing well with plenty of affiliates. While there is an ethos among forum members, again, this
feels like something that would’ve had some reflection in forum chatter or other media two
weeks later. People talk, and gossip is a byproduct of that communication, but nothing’s
been seen yet. So either there’s an excellent NDA (nondisclosure agreement) in place, or
nothing’s happened in this particular vein.
Counterpoint: It takes a warrant
The problem with proving any of this requires greater insight into the inner workings of the
group itself. Going that deep requires relationship-building, whether at a business or
personal level, and understanding the personalities of the group itself. Short of that, those
insights may be seen piecemeal by analyzing public statements over time; otherwise, only
someone with a wiretap would be able to see what’s behind the scenes and not on the
forums.
Verdict: Probable, but need a better understanding of the human elements at work.

Hypothesis 4: Rebrand
5/9

Point: Rebrands are in fashion
Actors typically would need to establish some credibility and reputation for a rebrand or
retooling of sorts, so something to watch out for would be some kind of public announcement
stating a new ransomware variant is available, and it’s from the team that brought you REvil.
There may be calls for new affiliates or investment into the business. Since we haven’t seen
that yet, this remains just a theory.
Given some of the recent talk from governments and media about REvil, there’s a possibility
that the newest REvil product is hiding right under our noses. Or, the heat may be too great,
so this is also driving the need for a bit of silence on the part of REvil. Prometheus’s recent
rebrand might indicate this was happening, but we have yet to see anything mentioned on
RAMP, the newest forum, or any chatter from other actors. This new forum seems to
welcome ransomware, as we’ve already observed LockBit advertising there, so maybe this is
where REvil resurfaces or behind a new variant.
Given the absence of any public law enforcement moves and a lack of any general
statements one way or another about any outcomes, this starts to become a very likely
scenario. We’ve seen this repeatedly happen as significant players stepped away to change
their business model, even just this year. In 2019 the group behind GandCrab went silent for
a bit, and then suddenly, Sodinokibi and REvil became the new thing in 2020.
One thing to note: an almost throwaway quote buried in the last couple of paragraphs from a
BBC story on Kaseya from 23 July 2021 deserves some attention here. The journalist’s
contact who claimed to have some insider knowledge of REvil stated that all of this is “part of
a new beginning.” Whether this is just a wild claim from someone to gain street credibility or
this is a vetted source speaking the truth, it keeps the door open to the possibility of a later
reemergence of REvil in a different form especially considering other indicators.
Verdict: Likely, but need to observe for other indicators.

Hypothesis 5: Vacation or Retirement
Point: Vacation is all I ever wanted
This one’s tough to prove because without knowing group personas outside of the dark web,
it’s hard to look for beach selfies on Instagram that could serve as the smoking gun here.
We’ve touched on this a few times, but Dmitri Alperovich of Crowdstrike fame floated the
idea that new Russian safe havens in Crimea, along with the summer heat of Moscow,
could’ve driven operators to take some time off. There’s also a saying that “a Russian resort
is preferable to an American prison.”
Point: Riding off into the sunset with bags of money

6/9

Retirement is definitely a route that’s been done before, especially when GandCrab (the yet
unconfirmed variant connected to REvil) decided to close up shop back in 2019. Most
recently, we’ve seen this to some extent with groups like Avaddon and Babuk Locker, who
exited in various forms this year. Babuk, however, came back fairly quickly under a new
moniker.
Looking at attacks over time, REvil was stepping up each attack in terms of ransom
amounts, to the point that the ransom for the Kaseya attack was to be a record $70 million
payout. Based on information from ransomwhe.re, we do know there’s at least four wallets
with just over $12 million in Bitcoin sitting there. Either way, not a bad pile of money to retire
on, potentially.
Counterpoint:
What does work against this theory was the lack of any public announcements either way.
Also it would likely take some time to move funds around in wallets, and in the instance of
law enforcement involvement, time would likely be another factor to consider.
Counterpoint: Travel may be difficult
If the operators are indeed operating from Russia or any of the former Soviet republics,
between COVID restrictions on travel in various countries as well as the potential for landing
in an extradition country, travel could be problematic.
Verdict: Realistically possible, but difficult to prove either way, without more
information and insight.

Hypothesis 6: The Wildcard
This area served as a drop-off point for any ideas that hadn’t been mentioned. Ideas like
alien abduction were not off the table but were found to be too improbable and reasonably
difficult to prove.

7/9

What is a more likely scenario for the wildcard is a combination of factors from the other
hypotheses. There were not quite enough convincing arguments to make a hypothesis the
best one. Some are stronger than others, primarily because of what we can prove or at least
consider.
For example, law enforcement might’ve infiltrated critical infrastructure or compromised
specific members, which means a forced reorganization of the business. Or pressure was on
among affiliates or group members who didn’t like all of the attention, which forced a
retirement or job search for some, while others stayed on to figure out the next course of
action. There may have even been dreaded customer churn among affiliates, and the public
bravado in June 2021 about the aftermath of JBS was just smoke and mirrors.
We may just be seeing a cooling-off period, a rebrand, and maybe even a reorganization,
which throws law enforcement off the scent. They may even still be around but using
different, less public means to communicate, recruit, and advertise. It may end up being all of
these factors, a combination of them, or none at all. Either way, we haven’t necessarily
closed the book on this group yet. Given some pretty significant successes over the last
couple of years for REvil, it might be too soon to retire, but on this third iteration, maybe it’s
only time to change some logos for this Oceans 13 crew.
Verdict: There are several motivating factors brought up in different areas, but law
enforcement action and/or rebrand are the most likely.

Changes in the Threat Landscape
This has been a pretty remarkable year in terms of major events impacting the threat
landscape. We’ve seen record-breaking attacks, lots of groups entering and exiting the
scene, and finally some attention from the very top: even heads of government are talking
about it; not to mention the news cycle has caught on. The fact that no one has come to a
8/9

decent conclusion yet speaks to a number of factors. If it is a rebrand, the group has
amazing operational security, and if there is some outsider knowledge about it, this is
showing that sometimes, there is truly honor among thieves. If it was law enforcement, the
silence continues to be a little unnerving.
At Digital Shadows, we continue to scour the world for information about this and other
campaigns to keep our clients informed. As we spoke about in our recent Q2 2021
Ransomware research, this is a problem that’s not going away, and despite one group’s
probable exit, there are more gaining in prominence. If you’re curious about our intelligence,
