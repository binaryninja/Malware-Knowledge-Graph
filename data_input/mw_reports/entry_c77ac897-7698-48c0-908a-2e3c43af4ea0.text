With contributions from Diane Wee, Innovation Strategist at Lookout. Diane helped with the
translation portion of this research.
The Lookout Threat Intelligence team has discovered a new mobile app threat targeting iOS
and Android users in Chinese speaking countries, Korea and Japan. The spyware, which we
have named Goontact, targets users of illicit sites, typically offering escort services, and
steals personal information from their mobile device. The types of sites used to distribute
these malicious apps and the information exfiltrated suggests that the ultimate goal is
extortion or blackmail.
We found that Goontact, which often disguises itself as secure messaging applications, can
exfiltrate a wide range of data, such as:

Device identifiers and phone number.
Contacts.
1/17

SMS messages.
Photos on external storage.
Location information.
Tablets and smartphones are a treasure trove of personal data. These devices store private
data, such as contacts, photos, messages and location. Access to all of this data enables
cybercriminals like the operators of Goontact to run a successful extortion campaign.

Malicious functionality and impact
These sextortion scams are exploiting Chinese-, Japanese- and Korean-speaking people in
multiple Asian countries. Evidence on distribution sites also suggests that this operation is
functional in China, Japan, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.
The scam begins when a potential target is lured to one of the hosted sites where they are
invited to connect with women. Account IDs for secure messaging apps such as KakaoTalk
or Telegram are advertised on these sites as the best forms of communication and the
individual initiates a conversation.

Lure site screenshots for Goontact that invite visitors to contact a KakaoTalk ID or a
Telegram ID to access the services being advertised.
In reality, the targets are communicating with Goontact operators. Targets are convinced to
install (or sideload) a mobile application on some pretext, such as audio or video problems.
The mobile applications in question appears to have no real user functionality, except to steal
the victim’s address book, which is then used by the attacker ultimately to extort the target for
monetary gain.

Potential attribution
We found that the websites associated with Goontact bear many similarities in naming
convention, appearance and targeted geographic region. The sites also used logos
associated with domains that were part of a sextortion campaign reported by Trend Micro in
2015.1
We believe this campaign is operated by a crime affiliate, rather than nation state actors.
While we have yet to uncover any definitive infrastructure links, we believe it is highly
probable that Goontact is the newest addition to this threat actor's arsenal. Most notably,
the iOS component of this scam has not been reported on before.
Based on our research, the campaign has been active since at least 2013. However, the
Goontact malware family is novel and is still actively being developed. The earliest sample of
Goontact observed by Lookout was in November 2018, with matching APK packaging and
signing dates, leading us to believe malware development likely started in this time frame.

Goontact iOS

Recent active Goontact distribution sites mimicking App Store pages. The servers used for
distribution of the malware also host a login panel indicating that they serve as commandand-control (C2) servers. The apps are under continuous development and have been

3/17

updated multiple times per month.
Early samples of the iOS version of Goontact show the primary functionality is to steal a
victim’s phone number and contact list. Later iterations incorporated functionality to
communicate to a secondary command-and-control (C2) server and display a message to
the user that has been tailored by the attacker, before exiting the app.

Code that exfiltrates a victim’s address list from an infected device.
Signing identities
Goontact on iOS relies on the user side-loading an IPA file from a distribution site. These
sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which provides a download URL for the IPA.
To successfully do this, Goontact abuses the Apple enterprise provisioning system.
To be distributed outside the App Store, an IPA file must contain a mobile provisioning profile
with an enterprise certificate. These enterprise certificates can be generated from the Apple
Developer console and can then be used to code sign apps using a signing identity tied to
the company’s developer profile or TeamID. The operators of Goontact were able to obtain
enterprise certificates apparently associated with legitimate businesses to sign their malware
which was then distributed on sites mimicking App Store pages.
The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to permit organizations to distribute
proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A
business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by
Apple.
This is a similar tactic used by other iOS threats we have observed such as eSurvAgent. It
requires the user to download the app through a browser, install it, navigate to their Settings
app and then explicitly trust the signing identity used to sign the IPA file. Only after a

4/17

verification process of the signing identity with Apple’s servers, is the app able to run on an
iOS device.

of Goontact. In the rightmost image above, the name of the company whose signing identity
was used to create the mobile provisioning profile for the app can be seen.
The enterprise mobile provisioning profiles used by Goontact all reference apparently
legitimate companies. The list, as shown below, includes companies registered in China and
in the United States across various sectors such as power generation companies, credit
unions, and railroad companies.

Most of the companies observed either have current or past developer profiles and
applications on the iOS App Store. However, It is still unclear to us whether these signing
identities have truly been compromised, or if they were created by the malware operators
masquerading as representatives of the companies in question.
During our research we observed multiple signing identities being revoked. In those cases,
new malware samples using a new identity immediately appeared on the distribution sites.
We sometimes observed this occurring multiple times a month, indicating the actors behind
Goontact have little difficulty acquiring access to additional accounts.
Goontact Android
The Android component of Goontact is much more feature-rich. In addition to contact
stealing, these samples contain more advanced functionality such as exfiltration of SMS
messages, photos and location.

entice individuals to download and install the malware samples.
Infrastructure
Most command-and-control (C2) domains leveraged by Goontact are sites also hosting the
iOS variant of the malware. Almost all active malware C2s have login panels on nonstandard ports such as 8085 and 9905.
6/17

All live C2 panels are in Chinese. This evidence, along with names of the companies being
used for developer profiles suggest that the developers and operators of the campaign are
Chinese speakers.
The path component of the C2 URL in current samples commonly includes “/JYSystem/” on
both iOS and Android, which is a reference to an open source HTML template available on
Github.2 After exploring the infrastructure during our research, we discovered dozens of
active sites with the same patterns hosting numerous IPA files. A number of them are listed
in our screenshot below but new domains are registered daily. These domains were linked to
each other using shared IP addresses and SSL certificates.

7/17

Domains generally appear to include the names of secure messaging apps in their names
and the campaign prefers the use of .top and .vip TLDs.
Lure sites are middleman sites that offer the option of setting up dates and chats with women
after paying a session fee. Recent lure sites include links to the malicious applications and
provide detailed installation instructions to the victims. The malicious APK files have been
observed to be hosted on the lure sites, but the IPA files are all hosted on separate
distribution sites as described above.

A lure site (red-v10[.]com) in Korean links back to Goontact samples hosted on one of the
distribution sites (redvios[.]com) along with instructions on how to install it. Sites are sensitive
to User-Agent headers in order to display an application appropriate for the device of the
user.
While the Goontact surveillance apps described in this campaign are not available on Google
Play or the iOS App Store, the duration, breadth and tactics exhibited highlight the lengths
malicious actors will go to deceive victims and bypass built-in protections. Lookout secures
consumers and enterprise users from Goontact. On Android, all Lookout users are protected,
whereas on iOS, Lookout for Work users and Lookout Premium Plus subscribers are
protected.
