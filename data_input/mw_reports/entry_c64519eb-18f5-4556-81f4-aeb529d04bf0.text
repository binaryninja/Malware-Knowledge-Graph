April 4, 2018

Dofoil is a sophisticated threat that attempted to install coin miner malware on hundreds of thousands of
computers in March, 2018. In previous blog posts we detailed how behavior monitoring and machine learning in
Windows Defender AV protected customers from a massive Dofoil outbreak that we traced back to a software
update poisoning campaign several weeks prior. Notably, customers of Windows 10 S, a special Windows 10
configuration that provides streamlined Microsoft-verified security, were not affected by the Dofoil outbreak.
In this blog post, we will expound on Dofoil’s anti-debugging and anti-analysis tactics, and demonstrate how the
rich detection libraries of Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection and Windows Defender Exploit Guard
can help during investigation.
We found that Dofoil was designed to be elusive to analysis. It checks its environment and stops running in
virtual machine environments. It also checks for various analysis tools and kills them right away. This can make
malware analysis and assessment challenging.
The following diagram shows the multi-stage malware execution process, which includes checks for traits of
analysis environments during some stages.

Figure 1. Dofoil multi-stage shellcode and payload execution flow
The table below describes the purpose of each stage. The first five stages have at least one or two different
techniques that can deter dynamic or static malware analysis.

Table 1. Dofoil’s multi-stage modules

Initial stages
The first three stages (i.e., obfuscated wrapper code, bootstrap module, anti-debugging module) use the
following techniques to avoid analysis and identification.
ANTIANALYSIS
TECHNIQUES

DESCRIPTION

Benign code
insertion

Inserts a huge benign code block to confuse heuristics and manual inspection

Antiemulation

Enumerates an arbitrary registry key (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface\{3050F557-98B511CF-BB82-00AA00BDCE0B}) and compares the data with an expected value
(DispHTMLCurrentStyle) to check if the malware runs inside an emulator

Self-process
hollowing

Uses the process hollowing technique on the current process, making analysis extra difficult
due to the altered code mapping

Debugger
checks

Checks for debuggers, and modifies code to crash. This can add additional layer of confusion
to researchers, who are bound to investigate the cause of the crashes. It checks for the
PEB.BeingDebugged and PEB.NtGlobalFlag fields in the PEB structure. For example,
PEB.BeingDebugged is set to 1 and PEB.NtGlobalFlag is set to
FLG_HEAP_ENABLE_TAIL_CHECK|FLG_HEAP_ENABLE_FREE_CHECK|
FLG_HEAP_VALIDATE_PARAMETERS when a debugger is attached to the process.

Table 2. Anti-analysis techniques
The first stage contains some benign-looking code before the actual malicious code. This can give the
executable a harmless appearance. It can also make the emulation of the code difficult because emulating
various API calls that are not present in many malware codes can be challenging.

2/13

The first-stage code also performs a registry key enumeration to make sure it has the expected value. When all
checks are passed, it decodes the second-stage shellcode and runs it on the allocated memory. This shellcode
un-maps the original main module’s memory, and then decodes the third-stage shellcode into that memory – this
is known as a self-process hollowing technique.

Windows Defender ATP’s process tree can help with investigation by exposing these anti-debugging techniques.

Trojan downloader module
3/13

The trojan downloader module performs various environment checks, including virtual environment and analysis
tool checks, before downloading the payload.
ANTIANALYSIS
TECHNIQUES

DESCRIPTION

Check
module name

Checks if the main executable name contains the string “sample”

Check
volume serial

Checks if current volume serial number is 0xCD1A40 or 0x70144646

Check
modules

Checks the presence of DLLs related to debuggers

Check diskrelated
registry keys

Checks the value of the registry key HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\Enum
against well-known disk name patterns for virtual machines (qemu, virtual, vmware, xen,
ffffcce24)

Process
check

Checks running processes and kills those with processes names associated with analysis
tools (procexp.exe, procexp64.exe, procmon.exe, procmon64.exe, tcpview.exe,
wireshark.exe, processhacker.exe, ollydbg.exe, idaq.exe, x32dbg.exe)

Windows
class name
check

Checks the current Windows class names and exits when some well-known names are found
(Autoruns, PROCEXPL, PROCMON_WINDOW_CLASS, TCPViewClass, ProcessHacker,
OllyDbg, WinDbgFrameClass)

Table 3. Anti-analysis technique of Dofoil’s trojan downloader module
The list of target process names and Windows class names exist in custom checksum form. The checksum
algorithm looks like the following:

The purpose of this checksum is to prevent malware researchers from quickly figuring out what analysis tools it
detects, making analysis more time-consuming.

Process hollowing
Dofoil heavily uses the process hollowing technique. Its main target for process hollowing is explorer.exe. The
Dofoil shellcode launches a new instance of explorer.exe, allocates shellcode in heap region, and then modifies
the entry point code to jump into the shellcode. This way, the malware avoids using CreateRemoteThread API,
but can still achieve code injection.

5/13

Figure 5. Modification of explorer.exe entry point code
Windows Defender ATP can detect the process hollowing behavior with advanced memory signals. The following
process tree shows that the malware injects itself into explorer.exe using the process hollowing technique.

Figure 6. Windows Defender ATP alert process tree showing the first process hollowing
When the shellcode downloads another layer of payload, it spawns another explorer.exe to inject the payload into
using process hollowing. Windows Defender ATP can save analysis time on these cases by pinpointing the
malicious actions, eliminating the need for guessing what these newly spawned Windows system processes are
doing.

Figure 7. Windows Defender ATP alert process tree showing the second process hollowing
The process hollowing behavior can be detected through Exploit protection in Windows Defender Exploit Guard.
This can be done by enabling the Export Address Filter (EAF) mitigation against explorer.exe. The detection
happens when the shellcode goes through the export addresses of the modules to find the export address of the
LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress functions.

Figure 8. Export Address Filter (EAF) event exposed in Event viewer
Windows Defender Exploit Guard events are also exposed in the Windows Defender ATP portal:

Figure 9. Windows Defender ATP view of the Windows Defender Exploit Guard event
Adding Windows Defender Exploit Guard EAF audit/block policy to common system processes like explorer.exe,
cmd.exe, or verclsid.exe can be useful in finding and blocking process hollowing or process injection techniques
commonly used by malware. This policy can impact third-party apps that may behave like shellcode, so we
recommend testing Windows Defender Exploit Guard with audit mode enabled before enforcement.

Command-and-control (C&C) and NameCoin domains
Dofoil’s C&C connection is very cautious. The trojan code first tries to connect to well-known web pages and
verifies that the malware has proper and real Internet connection, not simulated as in test environments. After it
makes sure it has a real Internet connection, the malware makes HTTP connections to the actual C&C servers.

Figure 10. Access to known servers to confirm Internet connectivity
The malware uses NameCoin domain name servers. NameCoin is a decentralized name server system that
provides extra privacy backed by blockchain technology. Except for the fact that the DNS client needs to use
specific sets of NameCoin DNS servers, the overall operation is very similar to a normal DNS query. Because
NameCoin uses blockchain technology, you can query the history of the domain name changes through blocks.

Figure 11. Malicious hostname DNS entry changes over time (https://namecha.in/name/d/vrubl)
Windows Defender ATP can provide visibility into the malware’s network activities. The following alert process
tree shows the malware’s .bit domain resolution activity and, after that, the connections to the resolved C&C
servers. You can also view other activities from the executable, for example, its connections to other servers
using SMTP ports.

Figure 12. Windows Defender ATP alert process tree showing C&C server connection through NameCoin server
name resolution
The Windows Defender ATP advanced hunting feature, which is currently in preview, can be used to hunt down
more malware samples that possibly abuse NameCoin servers. For example, the following advanced hunting
query finds recent connections to Dofoil C&C servers from your network. This can lead to extra insights on other
threats that use the same NameCoin servers.

9/13

Figure 13. Advanced hunting for other threats using the same NameCoin servers
The purpose of using NameCoin is to prevent easy sinkholing of the domains. Because there are no central
authorities on the NameCoin domain name records, it is not possible for the authorities to change the domain
record. Also, malware abusing NameCoin servers use massive numbers of NameCoin DNS servers to make full
shutdown of those servers very difficult.

Conclusion
Dofoil is a very evasive malware. It has various system environment checks and tests Internet connectivity to
make sure it runs on real machines, not in analysis environments or virtual machines. This can make the analysis
time-consuming and can mislead malware analysis systems.
In attacks like the Dofoil outbreak, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) can
help network defenders analyze the timeline from the victim machine and get rich information on process
execution flow, C&C connections, and process hollowing activities. With the new advanced hunting capabilities in
preview, you can run powerful custom queries and pivot freely to different sets of possible targets, malicious

entities, and suspicious activity. Windows Defender ATP can also be used as an analysis platform with fine-tuned
visibility into system activities when set up in a lab environment. This can save time and resource during malware
investigation.
In addition, Windows Defender Exploit Guard can be useful in finding malicious shellcodes that traverse export
address tables. Windows Defender Exploit Guard can be an excellent tool for finding and blocking malware and
exploit activities.
Windows Defender Exploit Guard events are surfaced in the Windows Defender ATP portal, which integrates
protections from other Microsoft solutions, including Windows Defender AV and Windows Defender Application
Guard. This integrated security management experience makes Windows Defender ATP a comprehensive
solution for detecting and responding to a wide range of malicious activities across the network.
Windows 10 S, a special configuration of Windows 10, locks down devices against Dofoil and other attacks by
working exclusively with apps from the Microsoft Store and using Microsoft Edge as the default browser. This
streamlined, Microsoft-verified platform seals common malware entry points.
