No Joking Around with JOKER

The Joker malware family has been consistently targeting Android users since it was discovered in 2017 and is
one of the most active malware families on the Google Play Store. It continues to find new tricks and tactics to
stay undetected by doing small changes in its code or changing the payload download techniques.
The family name “Joker” was derived from the Command and Control (C2) domain name it used in its early days.
This malware attempts to steal SMS messages, contacts from the victim’s device and silently signs up its victims
to the premium services without their knowledge.
At K7 Labs, we recently noticed a new Joker malware sample on Google Play Store, which utilizes Android
packers like “Tencent’s Legu” and “ijiami” packers to evade detection.

Technical Analysis
Once launched, at runtime it unpacks the malicious Android Package (APK) and contacts the C2 server to
download a malicious Dalvik Executable (DEX) file payload as shown in Figure 3, which enables the malware and
adds other capabilities.

This malicious payload continuously sends POST requests to hxxp[:]//161[.]117[.]46[.]64/svhyqj/mjcxzy for
communication as shown in Figure 4.
