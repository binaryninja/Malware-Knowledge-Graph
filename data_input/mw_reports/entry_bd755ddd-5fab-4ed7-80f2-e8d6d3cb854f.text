Confidence in the Connected World ™

Year in Review
2018

Welcome Message

In 2018, CIS once again demonstrated the
importance of our role as an independent,
global leader in cybersecurity.
Among our most notable accomplishments was the
creation of the Elections Infrastructure Information
Sharing & Analysis Center® (EI-ISAC®). Using the guiding
principle of “We can achieve more collectively,” CIS
entered the election security arena with the EI-ISAC in
March. In a parallel landmark development, CIS led the
collaborative production of A Handbook for Elections
Infrastructure Security to help election officials and their
technical support teams defend U.S. election systems and
networks vital to our functioning democracy.

Throughout the remainder of 2018, the EI-ISAC grew to
include all 50 states and almost 1,500 total members,
including many local election officials and their technical
staff members, election technology vendors, and federal
partners. In 10 scant months, the EI-ISAC became the
fastest-growing ISAC in history. The EI-ISAC also deployed
network monitoring sensors, called “Albert sensors,” to
help protect the most critical elements of our election
infrastructure.
By sharing information about the threat landscape,
monitoring network activity for malicious traffic,
educating election officials about cybersecurity, and
identifying necessary technical cybersecurity controls,
the EI-ISAC helped the U.S. election community make
substantial strides toward ensuring the security and
integrity of our elections.
During the primaries and mid-term elections, the
EI-ISAC sponsored an online National Cyber Situational
Awareness Room, which connected election offices
across the nation with the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, the FBI, and the EI-ISAC Security Operations
Center. The Situation Room provided real-time awareness
of cyber threats as well as physical incidents.

During 2018, the Multi-State Information Sharing &
Analysis Center® (MS-ISAC®) added more than 3,000
new members to reach 5,000 members. Overall
membership saw a 150 percent increase. MS-ISAC
municipal government members now cover 80 percent
of the U.S. population. Our partnership with state and
local government organizations and the Department
of Homeland Security continues to grow stronger with
increased depth and breadth of the intelligence provided
through the MS-ISAC monitoring, information sharing,
and cyber education missions.
CIS also greatly expanded the quality and quantity of our
product offerings this year. In January 2018, CIS launched
an effort to provide complimentary CIS SecureSuite®
subscriptions to all U.S. state, local, tribal, and territorial
governments. These organizations now have access to
this suite of powerful tools and CIS support services,
which will simplify implementation and enforcement of
high priority security controls.

In 2018, the number of CIS Hardened Images™ available
for Amazon Web Services®, Microsoft® Azure, and Google
Cloud® platforms was significantly increased. Cloud
customers used more than 160 million machine hours of
CIS Hardened Images in 2018. These cloud services have
emerged as our fastest-growing and most impactful
products.
The CIS Controls™ continue to set the standard for best
practices in cyber defense as recognized by leading
organizations around the world. Global recognition
included the European Telecommunications Standards
Institute, now globally known as ETSI, updating its
compendium of Technical Reports to include the
CIS Controls. In addition, the Aerospace Industries
Association (AIA) embraced the CIS Controls as the basis
for their Cyber Standard Practice document.
Numerous additions were made to the portfolio of
companion guides for these CIS best practice standards,
including the Implementation Guide for Industrial Control
Systems, which provides cyber defense guidance for
Industrial Control System environments. In addition,
CIS released the CIS Risk Assessment Methodology
(CIS RAM), to assist organizations in assessing overall
organizational cyber risks. To date, the CIS Controls have
been downloaded more than 157,000 times.
These 2018 achievements reflect the unwavering
commitment by the CIS team to help safeguard
organizations of all sizes against cyber threats—in short,
to continue our mission to deliver Confidence in the
Connected World.

CIS Controls

Overview
Developed by a global community of experienced
IT practitioners, the CIS Controls are a technologyand vendor-independent set of concise, prioritized
cybersecurity actions and best practices. The CIS Controls
team successfully increased global awareness and
adoption of this actionable set of best practices, while
simultaneously producing extensive new guidance
content in 2018.

15

Program Accomplishments
The CIS Controls Version 7 was launched in the first
quarter of this year. New features in CIS Controls
Version 7 include:

• Improved consistency and simplification of the 			
wording of each Sub-Control

• Implementation of “one ask” per Sub-Control
• More focus on authentication, encryption,
and application white listing

• Better accounting for security technology
and emerging security problems

• Better alignment with other frameworks
(such as the NIST CSF)

• Supports the development of related products

(e.g., measurements/metrics, implementation guides)

• Identifies types of CIS Controls (basic, foundational, 		
and organizational)

Paraguay Government
The government of Paraguay formally approved the use
of CIS Controls Version 7 as the cybersecurity baseline for
all government institutions. Implementation of the CIS
Controls 1-6, considered the basic Controls, will start in
February 2020. The goal is full implementation of all CIS
Controls by 2024.

• CIS Controls V7 Measures and Metrics – The CIS

Controls are organized in a hierarchal structure. There
are 20 Controls that are further divided into 171
Sub-Controls. As more organizations are adopting
this set of best practices, there is an increased
interest in being able to measure and manage their
implementation of the 171 Sub-Controls. CIS Controls
V7 Measures and Metrics addresses how to measure
if a Sub-Control has been implemented successfully
based on Six Sigma levels. Six Sigma is a data-driven
approach to quality, which works to reduce variation
and the associated defects, wastes, and risks in any
process.

• The CIS Controls team started work with the

University of North Carolina at Charlotte to develop
criteria for objectively measuring each of the 171
Sub-Controls. The primary focus will be on measuring
the different levels of the three implementation
groups. This work will pave the way for the future
creation of automated tools that will measure the
CIS Controls implementation.

The Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center
(MS-ISAC), with financial support from the Department of
Homeland Security, continued its mission to improve the
cybersecurity posture of the nation’s state, local, tribal,
and territorial (SLTT) governments through focused cyber
threat identification, protection, detection, response,
and recovery activities this year. Individual sectors
within our membership all saw marked increases in
growth throughout the year. MS-ISAC tribal government
membership increased by 81 percent, K-12 schools by
333 percent, and public utilities by 125 percent.
MS-ISAC also runs the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review
(NCSR), which provides insight on the level of maturity
and risk awareness of the SLTT’s information security
programs from year to year. DHS and MS-ISAC use
the results of this report to work on improving the
cybersecurity of the SLTT community.

669

SLT T
Entities

The results of the 2018 NCSR are based on participation
from 669 SLTT entities in 43 states. They include 277 local
governments (representing 43 states), six tribes, and
343 state agencies (representing 24 states). An analysis
of this year’s results showed that state, local, and tribal
peer groups continued to report overall scores which fell
below the recommended minimum maturity level.
All NCSR participants continue to identify the same top
five security concerns over the past four years:

• Lack of sufficient funding
• Increasing sophistication of threats
• Lack of documented processes
• Emerging technologies
• Inadequate availability of cybersecurity professionals

The MS-ISAC national
meeting was held in New
Orleans, where over 380
members from across the
nation came together.

EI-ISAC

The EI-ISAC is a voluntary and collaborative effort
based on a strong partnership between CIS, the DHS
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),
and the Election Infrastructure Subsector Government
Coordinating Council (EIS-GCC).
During 2018, the EI-ISAC evolved from an idea to a
formalized collective of dedicated election officials, their
staff members, associations, technology vendors, federal
partners, and cybersecurity experts working tirelessly to
help secure the U.S. elections infrastructure.
The EI-ISAC was conceived as a means of leveraging the
many capabilities and the infrastructure of the MS-ISAC.
The integration of the two continued after the EI-ISAC’s
formal launch in March. Both the MS-ISAC and EI-ISAC
benefit by operating under the auspices of CIS. This
allows them to work together to educate and protect
SLTT governments from the myriad cyber threats that are
aimed at both the traditional government IT systems and
those specific to elections.
Both ISACs continue to utilize centralized, and in many
cases shared, resources to enable a greater level of
visibility and information-sharing across the elections and
the SLTT government sectors to benefit the constituencies
of both organizations. Everything from webcasts to
workgroups to in-person meetings integrates the needs
of both ISACs, offering efficiency and consistency for the
Membership.
