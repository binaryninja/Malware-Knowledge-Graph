The highly anonymous and often secretive nature of the internet has led to the proliferation
of scams aimed at separating people and organizations from their money. Trend Micro has
been following these scams over the years and have seen many of them evolve from
simplistic schemes to more sophisticated campaigns. One of the most dangerous scams
today — one which cost organizations a combined US$1.7 billion in exposed losses in 2019
— is Business Email Compromise (BEC).
We have already tackled a large number of BEC-related topics. In this article, however, we
would like to raise awareness about a new modus operandi involving a very clever BEC
campaign that uses social engineering to target a huge number of French companies across
different industries.

Background

1/12

While investigating various BEC attacks, we found an isolated incident where malicious
actors impersonated a French company in the metal fabrication industry, which provides its
services to a lot of different companies.
The malicious actors behind the scam registered a domain that is very similar to the
legitimate one used by the business (with the fake one having a misspelled company name)
and used it to send emails to their targets. The fraudulent domain was registered on July 27,
2020, and the perpetrators sent the fraudulent email on the same day.
The email, which was impersonating a real employee of the company, contained a request
asking the targets to change the company’s banking reference to a new account with an
Italian bank.

Figure 2. Screenshot of the email containing a request to change the target company’s
banking reference to a new account in an Italian bank. A rough translation of the email:
“Following a banking account change, please find our new banking references (mail and
Bank Identifier Code) attached, which we kindly ask you to update in your files. Thank you
for your understanding. Please confirm the reception of this email and confirm the handling
of our request (very urgent!)
The email contained two PDF file attachments. The first one was a letter to confirm the
change, as seen in the screenshot below.

very professional and even contains the real footers and logos from the impersonated
company.
Meanwhile, the second PDF file shows the banking account reference number:

Note that as soon as we noticed the scam, we reached out to the targeted company (who
was incredibly responsive) and worked with them to prevent it from affecting their
organization. In addition, they had filed a complaint and reached out to the Italian bank to
stop the fraud attempt.
Initial investigation
We found references on the company website showing that the alleged sender of the
fraudulent email is an actual employee of the target company. However, instead of working in
the accounting department, as seen in the email, the person actually worked as a
webmaster. It’s possible that the fraudsters chose a random person based on the information
they found prior to their scheme and decided to use it for their operation.
Interestingly enough, the fraudsters committed several mistakes:
They forgot to change the target name in the header of the email content, therefore
leaking the name of another target. A perceptive employee could potentially identify
this as something unusual, which raises red flags.
We found another version of the PDF file that revealed the account being used for the
bank reference change had the name of an individual and was not registered under the
name of the target company.

the target company as the owner of the account, it shows the name of a person.
We investigated the name shown on the account but did not find any useful information other
than the fact that this name is used mostly in the Ivory Coast in Africa.
Delving deeper into the scam
The email address used to register the fraudulent domain has been used to register several
other domains since 2019, all of them showing similar names to legitimate French company
domains, but again with slight errors here and there (for example using “techrnologies”
instead of “technologies).

This list also reveals that the attackers are targeting a wide swath of industries, probably in
an opportunistic manner. While we could not confirm that all of these domains have been
used to commit BEC fraud, we did find at least one additional case in which the fraudsters
targeted an organization that was part of the healthcare industry.

Impersonating the French tax system
In many BEC schemes, the perpetrators infect the machines of their targets with malware
that will allow them to read — and therefore gather information — from emails. Once the
cybercriminals gain access to the mailboxes of their targets, they search for material on the
people involved with the organization's finance and accounting departments. In addition, the
attackers also look for information on the company’s customers and partners. Using this
method, BEC scammers can then impersonate an employee to entice a victim to carry out
their goals via social engineering.
This is BEC as we usually know it. We found evidence that the cybercriminals involved in this
case had used malware as well, but ultimately, they did not really even need it. Instead, they
used an alternative — and admittedly clever — method of hunting for their target’s
financial data themselves.
With the help of the organization that the scam targeted, we were able to determine the initial
approach the cybercriminals used: they presented their emails to appear as if it was from
the French tax system to gather information on their target. A little over two weeks before the
registration of the fake domain, the attackers sent the following email to the company:

Figure 6. The initial email sent by the malicious actors, allegedly from the General
Directorate of Public Finances (DGFiP) of France, concerning tax inquiries
The email contained an attached PDF file that seemed to be a letter from the French Tax
service:

Figure 7. The content of the PDF attachment sent with the email
Essentially, the PDF file contains a request from the spoofed government organization
asking the target company for information on their customers, employees, and other financial
data. The text also adds to the urgency of the request by mentioning possible fines if the
target organization refuses to cooperate.
The translation of the text found in the PDF file is as follows:
As happens every year, in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact with the European
Commission, the Directorate General of Public Finances is launching an investigation as part
of the verification of compliance with SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) conditions and
international standards.
As such, in accordance with the provisions of articles L.81, L.85 and article L.102 B of the
book of tax procedures, I would like to have, as soon as possible and no later than July
20, 2020, in dematerialized form, for each of your three (3) main Customers who pay
their services by SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) transfer for the period from
04/01/2020 to 07/31/2020 of: The aging balance to date, duplicate invoice
correspondents (Not having been paid by the customer and concerning the June, July
and August deadlines), contacts of the financial or accounting department (Emails,
Telephones and Postal address) and one (1) duly signed and sealed commercial
contract.
I would point out that this operation does not constitute a verification of your tax situation and
indicates to you that any refusal to cooperate is sanctioned by a tax fine provided for in
article 1734 of the general tax code.
I invite you to send us these documents in dematerialized form on our secure and functional
messaging: odac@dgfip-finances-gouv[.]cloud
While thanking you for your cooperation, please believe in the assurance of my distinguished
feelings.
The PDF letter looks (and reads) like a real document from the French tax service. In fact,
most French people would probably think this is a legitimate letter unless they look closely at
the email address used (dgfip-finances-gouv[.]cloud instead of the real domain, which is
dgfip.finances.gouv.fr).
As we highlighted in bold, the social engineering trick used in this email is for gathering data
that could potentially be useful for the malicious actors, such as client information and
commercial contracts. Once this information is in the hands of the scammers, they can then
move on to the next stage of the attack, which involves reaching out to the three contacts
mentioned in the PDF file.

9/12

One interesting side note: it seems the BEC scammers actually built their PDF file from a
real PDF file used by the French tax system. The real name of the author of the document
(as seen in the metadata) is indeed the name of a real government employee working in the
department responsible for handling tax-related issues.
The use of tax-related scams is something we’ve seen before. This incident confirms that the
information stolen using tax fraud is being used for malicious purposes, in this case, a BEC
scam.

Expanding the target range
We searched our systems for similar emails and found at least 73 different French
companies targeted by these cybercriminals.

Organizations in the manufacturing sector were by far the most targeted

10/12

The most targeted industry in this BEC campaign is manufacturing, particularly
manufacturing companies that build high tech products and materials. This was followed by
the healthcare, real estate, energy, and food and beverage industries. Many of the targeted
companies work with many different service providers and partners, making requests for
changes in banking references look less suspicious. It’s highly likely that the fraud is more
widespread than we have data on.
In addition to reaching out and working with the first organization we investigated, we also
notified the other targets, all of whom have been very reactive to the threat. We also helped
close the fraudulent domains.
Defending your organization from BEC attacks
Businesses are advised to educate employees on how BEC scams and other similar attacks
work. These schemes do not require advanced technical skills: all that’s needed to launch an
effective BEC scam is a single compromised account and services that are widely available
in the cybercriminal underground.
As such, here are some tips on how to stay safe from these online schemes:
Carefully scrutinize all emails. Be wary of irregular emails sent by high-level executives,
especially those that have an unusual sense of urgency, as they can be used to trick
employees into furthering the scam. Always review emails requesting for funds to
determine if the requests are out of the ordinary.
Raise employee awareness. While employees are a company’s biggest asset, they can
also be its weakest link when it comes to security. Commit to training employees,
reviewing company policies, and developing good security habits.
Verify any changes in vendor payment location by using a secondary sign-off by
company personnel.
Stay updated on customer habits, including the details and reasons behind payments.
Always verify requests. Confirm requests for fund transfers using phone verification as
a part of two-factor authentication (2FA), use known familiar numbers and not the
details provided in the email requests.
Report any incident immediately to law enforcement or file a complaint with the Internet
Crime Complaint Center (IC3).
