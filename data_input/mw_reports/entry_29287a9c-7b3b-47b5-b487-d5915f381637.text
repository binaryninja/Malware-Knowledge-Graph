What information are you storing in your Browsers?
1/12

Storing credentials and other important information in web browsers is a helpful method to
not have to remember or reenter login or payment information for regularly visited sites, but
threat actors also see this as an opportunity to steal credentials to either sell on the dark
web or use for further cyberattacks. Tools like Redline, Agent Tesla, and Raccoon Stealer
target popular web browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera,
demonstrating why storing important information in browsers is a critical security risk.

Stealing the web browser credentials is a technique observed in many campaigns and
utilized by numerous threat actors and APT groups, after acquiring the credentials from web
browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle the credentials across different systems and
accounts to expand access.

While there are multiple variants of malware that can lift browser credentials, for this article
we are going to highlight the activity of RedLine Infostealer due to its global reach and
prevalence in recent attacks.

Redline Infostealer is available either as a standalone application or on a subscription basis
on underground forums. As noted in the above table, RedLine gathers and exfiltrates a
range of data including system information and credentials, autocomplete data, and credit
card information from browsers, and FTP and IM clients. The malicious software also steals
cryptocurrency and can download additional files onto the infected device.
Unfortunately, if you are a victim of RedLine malware, it's not enough to just change the
passwords associated with that email account. Since RedLine targets all available data, you
must change the password for all accounts used on the infected machine, including
corporate VPN and email accounts, and other personal accounts.
RedLine Infostealer is commonly delivered by phishing emails, as well as social media
messaging. The phishing email can often lure the recipient by something topical, ongoing
current events, an often-used example being COVID-19 information.
Even if the users decline to store their credentials on the browser, the password
management system will still add an entry to indicate that the website is "blacklisted." While
the adversaries may not possess the actual passwords for the "blacklisted" accounts, it
does tell them of the account existence, thus allowing them to perform credential stuffing or
social engineering/phishing attacks.

Recommended Steps to Prevent Theft of Web Browser Credentials

4/12

Several mitigations can be put into place to prevent users from utilizing browser password
managers or preventing the theft of browser credentials. Web browsers typically store the
credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to
extract plaintext credentials from these credential stores.
Utilizing two-factor authentication can help reduce the risk of theft.
Incorporating third-party password managers that can provide additional security
controls.
Disabling the ability for users to utilize Browser Password Managers via the local
settings or Group Policy Object.

RedLine Payloads and Associated Activity Detections
MVISION Insights will provide the current threat intelligence and known indicators for
Redline Infostealer. MVISION Insights will also alert to detections and process traces that
have been observed in your environment and systems that require additional attention to
prevent widespread infection. MVISION Insights will also include Hunting Rules for threat
hunting and further intelligence gathering of the threat activity and adversaries known to
utilize Redline.

Detecting Malicious Activity with MVISION EDR
MVISION EDR is currently alerting to all known threat behavior and MITRE techniques
associated with RedLine Infostealer. The below examples are filtered to show where the
Redline malware accessed the encrypted login data within the Chromium based browsers
and was able to recover and decrypt the data using the Native APIs built into Windows.

Monitoring of Cloud Account Activity Post Infection
If an infostealer infection has been detected and possible credential theft is suspected to
have taken place, it is recommended to monitor for abnormal behavior within your cloud
accounts even after changing passwords. MVISION Cloud/Unified Cloud Edge provide
UEBA capabilities that can alert to abnormalities across your cloud environment looking at
numerous Anomaly Categories to detect possible abnormal and malicious behavior.
Additionally, adding impacted users to watchlists can help alert to suspicious activity from
monitored users that might have their credentials compromised.

Figure 13. Cloud Access Policies to set rules and reactions for accessing your cloud
environment.
Along with tracking user anomalies, an additional protection that can be utilized is setting
Cloud Access Policies to block access to your cloud applications by Unmanaged Devices or
connections from Restricted Countries. Setting cloud access policies can help stop the
successful reuse of stolen cloud application credentials being utilized on unmanaged
company devices.

Figure 14. DLP Policy automatically applied to Unmanaged Devices accessing Cloud
Services
The cloud access policy protections can also apply specific data protection policies on
unmanaged devices to limit the types and sensitivity of data that is allowed to be accessed
and to prevent the downloading of data based on specific cloud applications.
Trellix offers Threat Intelligence Briefings along with Cloud Security, Data Protection, and
Security Operation workshops to provide customers with best practice recommendations on
how to utilize their existing security controls to protect against adversarial and insider
threats, please reach out if you would like to schedule a workshop with your organization.
