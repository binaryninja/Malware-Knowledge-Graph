 rom late 2014 and through 2016, FANCY BEAR X-Agent implant
was covertly distributed on Ukrainian military forums within a
legitimate Android application developed by Ukrainian artillery
officer Yaroslav Sherstuk.

 he original application enabled artillery forces to more rapidly
process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed
by Ukrainian artillery forces reducing targeting time from
minutes to under 15 seconds. According to Sherstuk’s interviews
with the press, over 9000 artillery personnel have been using
the application in Ukrainian military.

intelligence by FANCY BEAR further supports CrowdStrike’s
previous assessments that FANCY BEAR is likely affiliated with
the Russian military intelligence (GRU), and works closely with
Russian military forces operating in Eastern Ukraine and its
border regions in Russia.

BAC KGR OUND
In late June and August 2016, CrowdStrike Intelligence provided initial
reporting and technical analysis of a variant of the FANCY BEAR implant
X-Agent that targeted the Android mobile platform2. CrowdStrike

identified this X-Agent variant within a legitimate Android application
named Попр-Д30.apk. This app was developed and used by artillery
troops to simplify targeting data for the D-30 towed howitzer. CrowdStrike
investigation reveals that this app has been utilized in a possible training
or operational role in at least one unit of the Ukrainian military. Therefore,
the implant likely targeted military artillery units operating against proRussian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
This implant represents further advancements in FANCY BEAR’s
development of mobile malware for targeted intrusions and extends
Russian cyber capabilities to the front lines of the battlefield. This Tipper
builds on CrowdStrike’s previous reporting by providing a timeline
of events, contextual discussion regarding the potential drivers for
development and deployment of the malware, and a description of the
analytical process resulting in targeting assessments. Finally, this Tipper
leverages these assessments, in conjunction with more recently observed
activity by Russia-based adversaries, to determine the potential for any
future activity in the mobile malware threat space.

TI M ELINE OF EVENTS

DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS
OF THE BENIGN APPLICATION
The original application central to this discussion, Попр-Д30.apk, was
initially developed domestically within Ukraine by a member of the 55th
Artillery Brigade. Based on the file creation timestamps as well as the
app signing process, which occurred on 28 March 2013, CrowdStrike has
determined that the app was developed sometime between 20 February
and 13 April 2013.
Shortly after that time frame, on 28 April 2013, an individual bearing the
same name as the application’s developer promoted the application
on Russian vKontakte3 pages associated with the artillery forces. The
promotion of the program was likely limited to social media, and the
distribution was controlled from the author’s main page, «Програмное
обеспечение современного боя» (translation: "Modern combat software").4
As an additional control measure, the program was only activated for
use after the developer was contacted and issued a code to the individual
downloading the application.
No evidence of the application has been observed on the Android app
store, making it unlikely that the app was distributed via that platform.
The control measures established by the developer to limit the use and
proliferation of the Попр-Д30.apk application, coupled with its unique
purpose, make its broad distribution on the Android store improbable.

”

At the time of this writing, it is unclear to what degree and for how
long this specific application was utilized by the entirety of the
Ukrainian Artillery Forces. Based on open source reporting, social
media posts, and video evidence, CrowdStrike assesses that Попр-Д30.apk
was potentially used through 2016 by at least one artillery unit operating
in eastern Ukraine.

RECONNAISSANCE, DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
OF THE MALICIOUS APPLICATION
R E C O N N AI SSAN CE
Given the estimated development timeframe and the promotional period
for the benign Попр-Д30.apk application, the program was likely available
online for distribution after late April 2013. CrowdStrike Intelligence
assesses that the application likely came to the attention of Russiabased adversaries around this time frame as a result of ongoing Russian

reconnaissance associated with the revolution in Ukraine. Actors with a
nexus to Russia regularly monitor social media sites in order to better
understand or formulate operations against their targets.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has noted instances in which some Russia-based
actors and attribution front groups have leveraged information obtained
from Ukrainian social media sites in order to perform operations. The
most notable recent example of this was in the case of extortion-based
threats directed against the Polish Government.5 In this particular case,
the perpetrators likely sought out openly available account information
from a vKontakte page belonging to a Ukrainian citizen, who was soliciting
donations to aid volunteer soldiers fighting in eastern Ukraine. The adversary
then used this profile information, in conjunction with the name "Pravyy
Sector," to make it appear as though the extortion threats against the Polish
government were originating from an ultranationalist Ukrainian group.
CrowdStrike has assessed that by performing this type of deceptive
operation the perpetrator likely sought to make it appear as though
Ukrainian interests were threatening the Polish government. In addition,
because the individual account hijacked for this operation had been used to
try to raise funds for Ukrainian forces, the adversary may have been trying to
aggravate Western governments enough to freeze the individual’s accounts.
The attack did not appear to achieve its intended result. Poland rebuffed the
threats, and the owner of the vKontakte page denounced any involvement

in the threat. Subsequently the Pravyy Sector group scrubbed their social
media page of much of the information associated with this failed operation.
This particular incident is an example of how a disinformation operation is
staged. While this incident is not likely to be related to the development of
the X-Agent Android variant, it demonstrates the reconnaissance and preplanning tactics that precede the rest of a campaign. Development
and Distribution
CrowdStrike has discovered indications that as early as 2015 FANCY BEAR
likely developed X-Agent applications for the iOS environment, targeting
"jailbroken" Apple mobile devices. The use of the X-Agent implant in the
original Попр-Д30.apk application appears to be the first observed case
of FANCY BEAR malware developed for the Android mobile platform. On 21
December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first
observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian
military forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development
timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early
December 2014.

During that proposed development timeframe, a number of significant
events unfolded between Ukraine, Russia, and the international
community. Most notably, Russian attempts to influence Ukrainian-EU
relations resulted in the large-scale, Maidan protest movement, eventually
resulting in the ouster of then-president Victor YANUKOVYCH, the invasion
and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, and the protracted
armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Therefore, the creation of an application
that targets some of the front line forces pivotal in Ukrainian defense
on the eastern front would likely be a high priority for Russian adversary
malware developers seeking to turn the tide of the conflict in their favor.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the distribution of the
malicious application targeted the very artillery units for which the benign
application was developed—brigades operating in eastern Ukraine on the
frontlines of the conflict with Russian-backed separatist forces during
the early stages of the conflict in late-2014. This assessment is based on a

member would only trust and use an application designed to calculate

application could be that targeting may have been directed at pro-Russian

by a member of their own forces. The type of operational activity described
here suggests an extremely sophisticated understanding of the target that
only a skilled adversary would likely possess.
By late December 2014, the total number of Russian forces in the region
was approximately 10,000 troops.6 Because the Android malware could
facilitate gross position information, its successful deployment could
have facilitated anticipatory awareness of Ukrainian artillery force troop
movement, thus providing Russian forces with useful strategic planning
information. Indeed, the 55th Artillery Brigade and similar artillery units
operated frequently against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
A video posted on 18 October 20157 specifically shows them employing the
Попр-Д30.apk application and operating in the vicinity of eastern Ukraine.
The choice of the Russian language character set in the application further
underscores the targeting of forces within eastern Ukraine, as Russian is the
predominant language utilized in that region. An assessment of languages
spoken by region based on the most recent census information illustrates
the permeation of the Russian language in that region and highlights the
value of providing Russian in the malicious Попр-Д30.apk application.

forces operating in eastern Ukraine. A relevant and likely counterargument for this theory, however, is that Russian
forces likely have employed fire support systems and other technologies that can already calculate targeting data,
negating the need for an application to perform this task. Additionally, the application was initially developed by a
member of the Ukrainian army. An opposing force would probably not adopt technology developed by the enemy for use
on the battlefield.

OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSION
The eastern Ukrainian front has been markedly impacted by heavy fighting involving Russian troops and pro-Russian
rebel fighters deployed to this region. Artillery forces on both sides of the conflict have served an important role. For
Ukrainian troops, artillery forces have also shouldered a heavy cost. Open-source reporting indicates losses of almost
50% of equipment in the last 2 years of conflict amongst Ukrainian artillery forces and over 80% of D-30 howitzers were
lost, far more than any other piece of Ukrainian artillery 9.9
Between July and August 2014, Russian backed forces launched some of the most decisive attacks against Ukrainian
forces, resulting in significant loss of life, weaponry, and territory. According to open sources, Ukrainian service
personnel from the 24th and 72nd Mechanized Brigade, as well as the 79th Airborne Brigade, were among the units to
have suffered casualties. International monitoring groups later assessed some of the attacks were likely to have come
from inside Russian territory.10
A malware-infected Попр-Д30.apk application probably could not have provided all the necessary data required to
directly facilitate the types of tactical strikes that occurred between July and August 2014. Eyewitness accounts from
individuals within the impacted units reported seeing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used in the area prior to one
attack, underscoring the need for precise locational data for these particular strikes and introducing the possibility

that the Android malware served to support the reconnaissance role of
traditional battlefield assets. Although traditional overhead intelligence
surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets were likely still needed
to finalize tactical movements, the ability of this application to retrieve
communications and gross locational data from infected devices, could
provide insight for further planning, coordination, and tasking of ISR,
artillery assets, and fighting forces.
The X-Agent Android variant does not exhibit a destructive function and does
not interfere with the function of the original Попр-Д30.apk application.
Therefore, CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the likely role of
this malware is strategic in nature. The capability of the malware includes
gaining access to contacts, Short Message Service (SMS) text messages,
call logs, and internet data, and FANCY BEAR would likely leverage this
information for its intelligence and planning value.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential
ability to map out a unit’s composition and hierarchy, determine their plans,
and even triangulate their approximate location. This type of strategic
analysis can enable the identification of zones in which troops are operating
and help prioritize assets within those zones for future targeting.
Additionally, a study provided by the International Institute of Strategic
Studies determined that the weapons platform bearing the highest losses
between 2013 and 2016 was the D-30 towed howitzer.11 It is possible that

the deployment of this malware infected application may have contributed
to the high-loss nature of this platform.
The development of the X-Agent Android malware represents an expansion
of FANCY BEAR capabilities in terms of mobile malware, and illustrates
the practical application of full-spectrum combat as envisioned in the
eponymous doctrinal writings of General Valery GERASIMOV. As a part
of full-spectrum operations in Ukraine, Russia-based adversaries have
leveraged malware on the battlefield, in the civil sector, and against
critical infrastructure. They have also engaged in aggressive information
operations in the media. In relation to this broader picture of Russian
computer operations, the approach to targeting mobile smartphone and
tablet devices in order to gain strategic insight into communications is a
tactic that cannot be disregarded.
CrowdStrike assesses that the observed and described X-Agent implant
targeting Ukrainian military Android devices running the Попр-Д30.apk

application is likely only the initial iteration of this type of malware. While
this malware was initially discovered in a battlefield environment, an
adversary could also leverage it in attacks against non-military targets.
Mobile devices and internet-connected technology have increasingly
proliferated civilian and military organizations. This technique may very
likely be deployed in the political, government, or non-governmental
sectors in the near future.
