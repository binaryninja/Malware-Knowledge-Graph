Introduction
Recently, a new series of malware samples were submitted to the major online
sandboxes. We noticed one sample submitted to Virus Total that was attributed
by some experts to the Russian APT28 group.
The
APT28
group (aka Fancy
Bear, Pawn
Storm, Sednit, Sofacy,
and Strontium) has been active since at least 2007 and it has
targeted governments, militaries, and security organizations worldwide.
The group was involved also in the string of attacks that targeted 2016
Presidential election.
With the help of the researcher that goes online with the Twitter handle Drunk
Binary (@DrunkBinary) we obtained a collection of samples to compare with
the one we were in possession to discover if we were in presence of a new
variant of the infamous APT28 backdoor tracked as X-Agent.
The attack we analyzed is multi-stage, an initial dropper malware written in
Delphi programming language (a language used by the APT28 in other
campaigns) downloads a second stage payload from internet and executes it.
The payload communicates to the server using HTTPS protocol, making it
impossible to eavesdrop on the malicious traffic it generates.
We also analyzed another malicious DLL, apparently unrelated to the previous
samples, that presents many similarities with other payloads attributed to the
Russian APT group. This malware is particularly interesting for us because it
contacts a command and control with the name “marina-info.net” a clear
reference to the Italian Military corp, Marina Militare. This lead us into
speculating that the malicious code was developed as part of targeted attacks
against the Italian Marina Militare, or some other entities associated with it.
This last DLL seems to be completely unconnected with the previous samples,
but further investigation leads us into believing that it was an additional
component used by APT28 in this campaign to compromise the target system.
APT28 has a rich arsenal composed of a large number of modular threats and
the dll is the component of the X-Agent we analyzed. X-Agent is a persistent
payload injected into the victim machine that can be compiled for almost any

Operating System and can be enhanced by adding new ad-hoc component
developed for the specific cyber-attack. In our case, the component was
submitted to online sandboxes while the new campaign was ongoing. We
cannot exclude that the APT group developed the backdoor to target specific
organizations including the Italian Marina Militare or any other subcontractor.
In our analysis we were not able to directly connect the malicious dll file to the
X-Agent samples, but believe they are both part of a well-coordinated surgical
attack powered by APT28.
The dll that connect to “marina-info.net” may be the last stage-malware that is
triggered only when particular conditions occur, for example when the malware
infects a system with an IP address belonging to specific ranges.

The same malware behind four executables
The first four executables listed in the previous paragraph were used as
infection vectors in the new campaign we investigated. The samples appear as
different payloads but further basic static analysis allowed us to discover that
they are the same malware sample:
- The first two samples are identical, with the unique difference that the
second one is packed using the UPX tool. Once unpacked it, we have
discovered the same payload with also the same hash of the first sample
- The third and the fourth ones are the identical too, also in this the
difference is that the fourth one is packed using the UPX tool.
- We can speculate that we have two different samples, then we were able
to extract 2 files from the second family: a classic “.lnk” file and a “jpg”
file.

Figure 1 - Extracted files

These files seem to be a classic img and a link, but actually the jpg file is the
executable of the second sample and in the link file is hidden the following
command:
%systemroot%\System32\cmd.exe
/c
copy
12-033-1589(1).rar
C:\Users\Public\12-033-1589(1).exe
||
copy
12-033-1589(2).jpg
C:\Users\Public\12-033-1589(1).exe
&
start
C:\Users\Public\12-0331589(1).exe

upnphost.exe

After executing the file, it contacts the IP “45.124.132.127” where it sends
periodically some information gathered on the operative system, using the
command line “cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo”.

According to the WHOIS records, the server is located in Hong Kong

The information is sent to the command and control through HTTPS
communication using a POST method.

Once the malware has sent the information about the host configuration to
the C2, it will download another file, “upnphost.exe”, stored in the path
“%APPDATA%\Local\Temp” that probably is the final payload.
Moreover, the executable implements a persistence mechanism by setting
the registry key:

This other file contacts another command and control “46.183.218.37”,
located in Latvia:

Our submission to VirusTotal

We also discovered that the “upnphost.exe” file was submitted to Virus Total
by us, likely because the evasion technique implemented by the dropper.
In order to analyze the dropper, we patched it. Once the patching was applied
we was able to analyze the complete malicious behavior of the malware.

Figure 5 - The patch point of the dropper

The malicious code starts contacting the previously mentioned Command and
Control and downloads this “upnphost.exe” file.
Below the results we obtained submitting the patched version of the binary
on VirusTotal:

AutoIt Script

The communication with the command and control is managed with a script
written in the AutoIt language. This script is embedded in the “upnphost.exe”
file as resource, and, when it is launched, it communicates with this other
server in HTTPS, sending some information about the victim’s computer.

Figure 7 - Piece of decompiled code

The above figure shows a piece of decompiled code of the AutoIt script,
where the IP address and the path, with relative user agent are masqueraded
in hexadecimal encoding.
After decoding the parameters, we obtain the IP address, the path and the
user agent used to contact the C&C and send back the information about the
target system.

POST

Another peculiarity, is the name of the function where is present the code for
the HTTPS communication. It is “checkupdate()” and it seems that the
malware is instructed to contact periodically the C&C waiting for new
commands.
The following picture shows the multi-stage attack:

Figure 8 – The multistage attack scheme.

sdbn.dll
This file was retrieved from the threat intelligence platforms and was flagged
as an APT28 sample, such as also the previous files. It is not clear if this sample
is connected to the previous ones, but probably it belongs to the same infection
campaign because it was uploaded in the same time period on several online
sandboxes.
Another characteristic in common to the previous files is that, this one is written
in Delphi programming language, like also the four initial file droppers. It is rare
to find a malware written in Delphi language, but previous investigations
conducted by other security firms confirm that the APT28 group already used
malware written in this language in past campaigns.
The most important evidence emerged from the analysis of the sdbn.dll is that
it contacted the domain: “marina-info.net,” a clear reference to the Italian
Marina Militare. The domain is resolved in the IP “191.101.31.250” which is
located in Holland:

The communication to the C2 is performed also in this case by using the
HTTPS protocol. We discovered at least three paths contacted with a custom
user agent header:
url
path1
path2
path3
path4

https://marina-info.net

Table 1 - url and paths discovered

Like the “upnphost.exe” malware, this other executable periodically contacts
the command and control waiting for new commands. However, we discovered
that the server responds always with 403 Status code Forbidden, also to the
requests sent by the malware itself.

Figure 10 - Response from the C2C

This behavior could be the result of a server-side control implemented by the
server to allow the requests coming only from particular IP addresses or simply
it was intentionally disabled by the attackers likely because they believe to have
been uncovered by the victims or by the security firms. It could be a security
mechanism implemented by the attackers to make hard the investigation of
security firms. Moreover, we decided to further investigate the detection rate of
this new file on VirusTotal. When we started our analysis it was zero, this
means that the threat was completely undetected and currently the malicious
code has a detection rate of 35/65.

The attack threat map
In this paragraph, we show the threat map with the location of the various IP
addressed contacted by the samples we analyzed.

Figure 11 - The ThreatMap

As we can see, the attack surface covered by the hacker group is incredibly
wide: there are two different C2Cs in Europe and another one in China to
mislead the analysis and this create confusion during the reconstruction of the
complete cyber-attack.
