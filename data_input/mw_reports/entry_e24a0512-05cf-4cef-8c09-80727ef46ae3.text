Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber
Threats to Critical Infrastructure
SUMMARY
The cybersecurity authorities of the United States[1][2][3],
Australia[4], Canada[5], New Zealand[6], and the United
Kingdom[7][8] are releasing this joint Cybersecurity
Advisory (CSA). The intent of this joint CSA is to warn
organizations that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could
expose organizations both within and beyond the region to
increased malicious cyber activity. This activity may occur
as a response to the unprecedented economic costs
imposed on Russia as well as materiel support provided by
the United States and U.S. allies and partners.
Evolving intelligence indicates that the Russian government
is exploring options for potential cyberattacks (see the

March 21, 2022, Statement by U.S. President Biden for more information). Recent Russian statesponsored cyber operations have included distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and older
operations have included deployment of destructive malware against Ukrainian government and
critical infrastructure organizations.
Additionally, some cybercrime groups have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian
government. These Russian-aligned cybercrime groups have threatened to conduct cyber operations
in retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government or the Russian people.
Some groups have also threatened to conduct cyber operations against countries and organizations
providing materiel support to Ukraine. Other cybercrime groups have recently conducted disruptive
attacks against Ukrainian websites, likely in support of the Russian military offensive.
This advisory updates joint CSA Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber
Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure, which provides an overview of Russian state-sponsored cyber
operations and commonly observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This CSA—
coauthored by U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities with contributions
from industry members of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC)—provides an overview of
Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, Russian-aligned cyber threat
groups, and Russian-aligned cybercrime groups to help the cybersecurity community protect against
possible cyber threats.
U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge critical infrastructure
network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats—including destructive malware,
ransomware, DDoS attacks, and cyber espionage—by hardening their cyber defenses and
performing due diligence in identifying indicators of malicious activity. Refer to the Mitigations section
of this advisory for recommended hardening actions.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Operations
Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have demonstrated capabilities to compromise IT networks;
develop mechanisms to maintain long-term, persistent access to IT networks; exfiltrate sensitive data
from IT and operational technology (OT) networks; and disrupt critical industrial control systems
(ICS)/OT functions by deploying destructive malware.
Historical operations have included deployment of destructive malware—including BlackEnergy and
NotPetya—against Ukrainian government and critical infrastructure organizations. Recent Russian
state-sponsored cyber operations have included DDoS attacks against Ukrainian organizations. Note:
for more information on Russian state-sponsored cyber activity, including known TTPs, see joint CSA
Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure.
Cyber threat actors from the following Russian government and military organizations have conducted
malicious cyber operations against IT and/or OT networks:
•
•
•
•
•

The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), including FSB’s Center 16 and Center 18
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)
Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), 85th Main Special Service
Center (GTsSS)
GRU’s Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST)
Russian Ministry of Defense, Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics
(TsNIIKhM)

The Russian Federal Security Service
Overview: FSB, the KGB’s successor agency, has conducted malicious cyber operations targeting
the Energy Sector, including UK and U.S. energy companies, U.S. aviation organizations, U.S.
government and military personnel, private organizations, cybersecurity companies, and journalists.
FSB has been known to task criminal hackers for espionage-focused cyber activity; these same
hackers have separately been responsible for disruptive ransomware and phishing campaigns.
Industry reporting identifies three intrusion sets associated with the FSB, but the U.S. and UK
governments have only formally attributed one of these sets—known as BERSERK BEAR—to FSB.
•

BERSERK BEAR (also known as Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, Energetic Bear, and
Temp.Isotope) has, according to industry reporting, historically targeted entities in Western
Europe and North America, including state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) organizations, as
well as Energy, Transportation Systems, and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector
organizations. This group has also targeted the Water and Wastewater Systems Sector and
other critical infrastructure facilities. Common TTPs include scanning to exploit internet-facing
infrastructure and network appliances, conducting brute force attacks against public-facing
web applications, and leveraging compromised infrastructure—often websites frequented or

owned by their target—for Windows New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTLM)
credential theft. Industry reporting assesses that this actor has a destructive mandate.
The U.S. and UK governments assess that this APT group is almost certainly FSB’s Center
16, or Military Unit 71330, and that FSB’s Center 16 has conducted cyber operations against
critical IT systems and infrastructure in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.
Resources: for more information on BERSERK BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK® webpage
on Dragonfly.
High-Profile Activity: in 2017, FSB employees, including one employee in the FSB Center for
Information Security (also known as Unit 64829 and Center 18), were indicted by the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) for accessing email accounts of U.S. government and military personnel,
private organizations, and cybersecurity companies, as well as email accounts of journalists critical of
the Russian government.[9] More recently, in 2021, FSB Center 16 officers were indicted by the U.S.
DOJ for their involvement in a multi-stage campaign in which they gained remote access to U.S. and
international Energy Sector networks, deployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated
enterprise and ICS-related data. One of the victims was a U.S. nuclear power plant.[10]

Actors Targeting the Energy Sector
UK Press Release UK Exposes Russian Spy Agency Behind Cyber Incidents

Russian Foreign Intelligence Service
Overview: SVR has operated an APT group since at least 2008 that has targeted multiple critical
infrastructure organizations. SVR cyber threat actors have used a range of initial exploitation
techniques that vary in sophistication coupled with stealthy intrusion tradecraft within compromised
networks. SVR cyber actors’ novel tooling and techniques include:
•
•

Custom, sophisticated multi-platform malware targeting Windows and Linux systems (e.g.,
GoldMax and TrailBlazer); and
Lateral movement via the “credential hopping” technique, which includes browser cookie theft
to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) on privileged cloud accounts.[11]

High-Profile Activity: the U.S. Government, the Government of Canada, and the UK Government
assess that SVR cyber threat actors were responsible for the SolarWinds Orion supply chain
compromise and the associated campaign that affected U.S. government agencies, critical
infrastructure entities, and private sector organizations.[12][13][14]
Also known as: APT29, COZY BEAR, CozyDuke, Dark Halo, The Dukes, NOBELIUM, and
NobleBaron, StellarParticle, UNC2452, YTTRIUM [15]

GRU, 85th Main Special Service Center
Overview: GTsSS, or Unit 26165, is an APT group that has operated since at least 2004 and
primarily targets government organizations, travel and hospitality entities, research institutions, and
non-governmental organizations, in addition to other critical infrastructure organizations.
According to industry reporting, GTsSS cyber actors frequently collect credentials to gain initial
access to target organizations. GTsSS actors have collected victim credentials by sending
spearphishing emails that appear to be legitimate security alerts from the victim’s email provider and
include hyperlinks leading to spoofed popular webmail services’ logon pages. GTsSS actors have
also registered domains to conduct credential harvesting operations. These domains mimic popular
international social media platforms and masquerade as tourism- and sports-related entities and
music and video streaming services.
High-Profile Activity: the U.S. Government assesses that GTsSS cyber actors have deployed
Drovorub malware against victim devices as part of their cyber espionage operations.[16] The U.S.
Government and UK Government assess that GTsSS actors used a Kubernetes® cluster to conduct
widespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force access attempts against hundreds of
government and private sector targets worldwide.[17]
Also known as: APT28, FANCY BEAR, Group 74, IRON TWILIGHT, PawnStorm, Sednit,
SNAKEMACKEREL, Sofacy, STRONTIUM, Swallowtail, TG-4127, Threat Group-4127, and Tsar
Team [18]
Resources: for more information on GTsSS, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on APT28.

GRU’s Main Center of Special Technologies
Overview: GTsST, or Unit 74455, is an APT group that has operated since at least 2009 and has
targeted a variety of critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Energy, Transportation
Systems, and Financial Services Sectors. According to industry reporting, GTsST also has an
extensive history of conducting cyber espionage as well as destructive and disruptive operations

TLP:WHITE

against NATO member states, Western government and military organizations, and critical
infrastructure-related organizations, including in the Energy Sector.
The primary distinguishing characteristic of the group is its operations use techniques aimed at
causing disruptive or destructive effects at targeted organizations using DDoS attacks or wiper
malware. The group’s destructive operations have also leveraged wiper malware that mimics
ransomware or hacktivism and can result in collateral effects to organizations beyond the primary
intended targets. Some of their disruptive operations have shown disregard or ignorance of potential
secondary or tertiary effects.
High-Profile Activity: the malicious activity below has been previously attributed to GTsST by the
U.S. Government and the UK Government.[19][20]
•

•

•

•

GTsST actors conducted a cyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution companies in
December 2015, leading to disruption of multiple companies’ operations and widespread
temporary outages. The actors deployed BlackEnergy malware to steal user credentials and
used BlackEnergy’s destructive component, KillDisk, to make infected computers inoperable.
In 2016, GTsST actors conducted a cyber-intrusion campaign against a Ukrainian electrical
transmission company and deployed CrashOverride malware (also known as Industroyer)
specifically designed to attack power grids.
In June 2017, GTsST actors deployed NotPetya disruptive malware against Ukrainian
financial, energy, and government organizations. NotPetya masqueraded as ransomware, had
a large collateral impact, and caused damage to millions of devices globally.
In 2018, GTsST actors deployed data-deletion malware against the Winter Olympics and
Paralympics and separately targeted home and office routers worldwide using VPNFilter.

The U.S. Government, Government of Canada, and UK Government have also attributed the October
2019 large-scale, disruptive cyber operations against a range of Georgian web hosting providers to
GTsST. This activity resulted in websites—including sites belonging to the Georgian government,
courts, non-government organizations (NGOs), media, and businesses—being defaced and
interrupted the service of several national broadcasters.[21][22][23]
Also known as: ELECTRUM, IRON VIKING, Quedagh, the Sandworm Team, Telebots, VOODOO
BEAR [24]

Russian Ministry of Defense, Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics
Overview: TsNIIKhM, as described on their webpage, is a research organization under Russia’s
Ministry of Defense (MOD). Actors associated with TsNIIKhM have developed destructive ICS
malware.
High-Profile Activity: TsNIIKhM has been sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for
connections to the destructive Triton malware (also called HatMan and TRISIS); TsNIIKhM has been
sanctioned by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) for a 2017 incident

that involved safety override controls (with Triton malware) in a foreign oil refinery.[25][26] In 2021,
the U.S. DOJ indicted a TsNIIKhM Applied Development Center (ADC) employee for conducting
computer intrusions against U.S. Energy Sector organizations. The indicted employee also accessed
the systems of a foreign oil refinery and deployed Triton malware.[27] Triton is a custom-built malware
designed to manipulate safety instrumented systems within ICS controllers, disabling the safety
alarms that prevent dangerous conditions.
Also known as: Temp.Veles, XENOTIME [28]

Russian-Aligned Cyber Threat Groups
In addition to the APT groups identified in the Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Operations section,
industry reporting identifies two intrusion sets—PRIMITIVE BEAR and VENOMOUS BEAR—as statesponsored APT groups, but U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities have
not attributed these groups to the Russian government.
•

PRIMITIVE BEAR has, according to industry reporting, targeted Ukrainian organizations since
at least 2013. This activity includes targeting Ukrainian government, military, and law
enforcement entities using high-volume spearphishing campaigns to deliver its custom
malware. According to industry reporting, PRIMITIVE BEAR conducted multiple cyber
operations targeting Ukrainian organizations in the lead up to Russia’s invasion.
Resources: for more information on PRIMITIVE BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on
the Gamaredon Group.

•

VENOMOUS BEAR has, according to industry reporting, historically targeted governments
aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), defense contractors, and other
organizations of intelligence value. Venomous Bear is known for its unique use of hijacked
satellite internet connections for command and control (C2). It is also known for the hijacking
of other non-Russian state-sponsored APT actor infrastructure.[29] VENOMOUS BEAR has
also historically leveraged compromised infrastructure and maintained an arsenal of customdeveloped sophisticated malware families, which is extremely complex and interoperable with
variants developed over time. VENOMOUS BEAR has developed tools for multiple platforms,
including Windows, Mac, and Linux.[30]
Resources: for more information on VENOMOUS BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage
on Turla.

Russian-Aligned Cybercrime Groups
Cybercrime groups are typically financially motivated cyber actors that seek to exploit human or
security vulnerabilities to enable direct theft of money (e.g., by obtaining bank login information) or by
extorting money from victims. These groups pose consistent threats to critical infrastructure
organizations globally.
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some cybercrime groups have independently
publicly pledged support for the Russian government or the Russian people and/or threatened to
conduct cyber operations to retaliate against perceived attacks against Russia or materiel support for
Ukraine. These Russian-aligned cybercrime groups likely pose a threat to critical infrastructure
organizations primarily through:
•
•

Deploying ransomware through which cyber actors remove victim access to data (usually via
encryption), potentially causing significant disruption to operations.
Conducting DDoS attacks against websites.
o In a DDoS attack, the cyber actor generates enough requests to flood and overload the
target page and stop it from responding.
o DDoS attacks are often accompanied by extortion.
o According to industry reporting, some cybercrime groups have recently carried out
DDoS attacks against Ukrainian defense organizations, and one group claimed credit
for DDoS attack against a U.S. airport the actors perceived as supporting Ukraine (see
the Killnet section).

Based on industry and open-source reporting, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK
cyber authorities assess multiple Russian-aligned cybercrime groups pose a threat to critical
infrastructure organizations. These groups include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The CoomingProject
Killnet
MUMMY SPIDER
SALTY SPIDER
SCULLY SPIDER
SMOKEY SPIDER
WIZARD SPIDER
The Xaknet Team

Note: although some cybercrime groups may conduct cyber operations in support of the Russian
government, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities assess that cyber
criminals will most likely continue to operate primarily based on financial motivations, which may
include targeting government and critical infrastructure organizations.

The CoomingProject
Overview: the CoomingProject is a criminal group that extorts money from victims by exposing or
threatening to expose leaked data. Their data leak site was launched in August 2021.[31] The

Page 8 of 9 | Product ID: AA22-110A

TLP: WHITE

UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ

TLP:WHITE

Product ID: AA22-110A

CoomingProject stated they would support the Russian Government in response to perceived
cyberattacks against Russia.[32]

Killnet
Overview: according to open-source reporting, Killnet released a video pledging support to
Russia.[33]
Victims: Killnet claimed credit for carrying out a DDoS attack against a U.S. airport in March 2022 in
response to U.S. materiel support for Ukraine.[34]

MUMMY SPIDER
Overview: MUMMY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that creates, distributes, and operates the Emotet
botnet. Emotet is advanced, modular malware that originated as a banking trojan (malware designed
to steal information from banking systems but that may also be used to drop additional malware and
ransomware). Today Emotet primarily functions as a downloader and distribution service for other
cybercrime groups. Emotet has been used to deploy WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot, which is often a
precursor to ransomware delivery. Emotet has worm-like features that enable rapid spreading in an
infected network.
Victims: according to open sources, Emotet has been used to target industries worldwide, including
financial, e-commerce, healthcare, academia, government, and technology organizations’ networks.
Also known as: Gold Crestwood, TA542, TEMP.Mixmaster, UNC3443
Resources: for more information on Emotet, see joint Alert Emotet Malware. For more information on
TrickBot, see joint CSA TrickBot Malware.

SALTY SPIDER
Overview: SALTY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops and operates the Sality botnet. Sality
is a polymorphic file infector that was discovered in 2003; since then, it has been replaced by more
advanced peer-to-peer (P2P) malware loaders.[35]
Victims: according to industry reporting, in February 2022, SALTY SPIDER conducted DDoS attacks
against Ukrainian web forums used to discuss events relating to Russia’s military offensive against
the city of Kharkiv.
Also known as: Sality

SCULLY SPIDER
Overview: SCULLY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that operates using a malware-as-a-service
model; SCULLY SPIDER maintains command and control infrastructure and sells access to their
malware and infrastructure to affiliates, who distribute their own malware.[36][37] SCULLY SPIDER
develops and operates the DanaBot botnet, which originated primarily as a banking Trojan but
expanded beyond banking in 2021 and has since been used to facilitate access for other types of
malware, including TrickBot, DoppelDridex, and Zloader. Like Emotet, Danabot effectively functions
as an initial access vector for other malware, which can result in ransomware deployment.

Page 9 of 10 | Product ID: AA22-110A

TLP: WHITE

UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ

TLP:WHITE

Product ID: AA22-110A

According to industry reporting, recent DDoS activity by the DanaBot botnet suggests SCULLY
SPIDER has operated in support of Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine.
Victims: SCULLY SPIDER affiliates have primarily targeted organizations in the United States,
Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, Mexico, and Ukraine.[38] According to
industry reporting, in March 2022, Danabot was used in DDoS attacks against multiple Ukrainian
government organizations.
Also known as: Gold Opera

SMOKEY SPIDER
Overview: SMOKEY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops Smoke Loader (also known as
Smoke Bot), a malicious bot that is used to upload other malware. Smoke Loader has been available
since at least 2011, and operates as a malware distribution service for a number of different payloads,
including—but not limited to—DanaBot, TrickBot, and Qakbot.
Victims: according to industry reporting, Smoke Loader was observed in March 2022 distributing
DanaBot payloads that were subsequently used in DDoS attacks against Ukrainian targets.
Resources: for more information on Smoke Loader, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on Smoke
Loader.

WIZARD SPIDER
Overview: WIZARD SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops TrickBot malware and Conti
ransomware. Historically, the group has paid a wage to the ransomware deployers (referred to as
affiliates), some of whom may then receive a share of the proceeds from a successful ransomware
attack. In addition to TrickBot, notable initial access and persistence vectors for affiliated actors
include Emotet, Cobalt Strike, spearphishing, and stolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
credentials.
After obtaining access, WIZARD SPIDER affiliated actors have relied on various publicly available
and otherwise legitimate tools to facilitate earlier stages of the attack lifecycle before deploying Conti
ransomware.
WIZARD SPIDER pledged support to the Russian government and threatened critical infrastructure
organizations of countries perceived to carry out cyberattacks or war against the Russian
government.[39] They later revised this pledge and threatened to retaliate against perceived attacks
against the Russian people.[40]
Victims: Conti victim organizations span across multiple industries, including construction and
engineering, legal and professional services, manufacturing, and retail. In addition, WIZARD SPIDER
affiliates have deployed Conti ransomware against U.S. healthcare and first responder networks.
Also known as: UNC2727, Gold Ulrick
Resources: for more information on Conti, see joint CSA Conti Ransomware. For more information
on TrickBot, see joint CSA TrickBot Malware.

The XakNet Team
Overview: XakNet is a Russian-language cyber group that has been active as early as March 2022.
According to open-source reporting, the XakNet Team threatened to target Ukrainian organizations in
response to perceived DDoS or other attacks against Russia.[41] According to reporting from
industry, on March 31, 2022, XakNet released a statement stating they would work “exclusively for
the good of [Russia].” According to industry reporting, the XakNet Team may be working with or
associated with Killnet actors, who claimed credit for the DDoS attacks against a U.S. airport (see the
Killnet section).
Victims: according to industry reporting, in late March 2022, the XakNet Team leaked email contents
of a Ukrainian government official. The leak was accompanied by a political statement criticizing the
Ukrainian government, suggesting the leak was politically motivated.

MITIGATIONS
U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities urge critical infrastructure
organizations to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats by immediately (1) updating software,
(2) enforcing MFA, (3) securing and monitoring RDP and other potentially risky services, and (4)
providing end-user awareness and training.
•

Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT
network assets. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities and critical and high
vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing
equipment.
o Consider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a riskbased assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones that should
participate in the patch management program.
o Consider signing up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability
scanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service
evaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP
addresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.

•

Enforce MFA to the greatest extent possible and require accounts with password
logins, including service accounts, to have strong passwords. Do not allow passwords to
be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have
access. As Russian state-sponsored APT actors have demonstrated the ability to exploit
default MFA protocols and known vulnerabilities, organizations should review configuration
policies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment scenarios. For more information, see
joint CSA Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default
Multifactor Authentication Protocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability.
If you use RDP and/or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them
closely. RDP exploitation is one of the top initial infection vectors for ransomware, and risky

•

TLP:WHITE

services, including RDP, can allow unauthorized access to your session using an on-path
attacker.
o Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and
using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed
operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate
credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private
network (VPN) or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before
allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce
account lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force attempts, log
RDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.
o Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable
ports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP
Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389).
•

Provide end-user awareness and training to help prevent successful targeted social
engineering and spearphishing campaigns. Phishing is one of the top infection vectors for
ransomware, and Russian state-sponsored APT actors have conducted successful
spearphishing campaigns to gain credentials of target networks.
o Ensure that employees are aware of potential cyber threats and delivery methods.
o Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they
receive a suspected phishing email or suspect a cyber incident.

As part of a longer-term effort, implement network segmentation to separate network segments
based on role and functionality. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware
and threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various
subnetworks.
•
•

•

Ensure OT assets are not externally accessible. Ensure strong identity and access
management when OT assets needs to be externally accessible.
Appropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network
segmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network
is compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated communication
between the IT and OT networks.
Organize OT assets into logical zones by considering criticality, consequence, and operational
necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones and deploy security
controls to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones. Prohibit ICS
protocols from traversing the IT network.

To further prepare for and mitigate cyber threats from Russian state-sponsored or criminal actors,
U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities encourage critical infrastructure
organizations to implement the recommendations listed below.

Preparing for Cyber Incidents
•

Create, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations plan.
o Ensure the cyber incident response plan contains ransomware- and DDoS-specific
annexes. For information on preparing for DDoS attacks, see NCSC-UK guidance on
preparing for denial-of-service attacks.
o Keep hard copies of the incident response plan to ensure responders and network
defenders can access the plan if the network has been shut down by ransomware, etc.

•

Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data. Backup procedures should be
conducted on a frequent, regular basis (at a minimum every 90 days). Regularly test backup
procedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could enable
the spread of malware.
o Ensure the backup keys are kept offline as well, to prevent them being encrypted in a
ransomware incident.

•

Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers
the entire organization’s data infrastructure with a particular focus on key data assets.
Develop recovery documentation that includes configuration settings for common devices and
critical equipment. Such documentation can enable more efficient recovery following an
incident.
Identify the attack surface by mapping and accounting all external-facing assets (applications,
servers, IP addresses) that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks or other cyber operations.
For OT assets/networks:
o Identify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to—or
control of—the IT and/or OT environment.
o Identify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or manual
controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated from IT networks if the connections
create risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test
contingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety-critical functions can be
maintained during a cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate at
necessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.
o Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or
OT networks need to be taken offline.
o Implement data backup procedures.
o Develop recovery documents that include configuration settings for common devices
and critical OT equipment.

Identity and Access Management
•

Require accounts with password logins, including service accounts, to have strong passwords
and do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to
which an adversary may have access. Consider using a password manager; see NCSC-UK’s
Password Manager Buyers Guide for guidance.

•
•

Implement authentication timeout and lockout features to prevent repeated failed login
attempts and successful brute-force attempts.
Create a deny list of known compromised credentials and prevent users from using knowncompromised passwords.
Secure credentials by restricting where accounts and credentials can be used and by using
local device credential protection features. Russian state-sponsored APT actors have
demonstrated their ability to maintain persistence using compromised credentials.
o Use virtualizing solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are
securely stored.
o Ensure storage of clear text passwords in Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
(LSASS) memory is disabled. Note: for Windows 8, this is enabled by default. For
more information see Microsoft Security Advisory Update to Improve Credentials
Protection and Management.
o Consider disabling or limiting NTLM and WDigest Authentication.
o Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (refer to Microsoft:
Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For Windows
Server 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).
o Minimize the Active Directory (AD) attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting
activity. Malicious activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ Ticket
Granting Service (TGS) and can be used to obtain hashed credentials that malicious
cyber actors attempt to crack.

•

Audit domain controllers to log successful Kerberos TGS requests and ensure the events are
monitored for anomalous activity.
o Secure accounts.
o Enforce the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the
minimum permission necessary to complete their tasks.
o Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of
administrative tasks.
o Create non-privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the nonprivileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).

•
•

Disable inactive accounts uniformly across the AD, MFA systems, etc.
Implement time-based access for privileged accounts. The FBI and CISA observed
cybercriminals conducting increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. entities on holidays and
weekends in 2021. Threat actors may view holidays and weekends—when offices are
normally closed—as attractive timeframes, as there are fewer network defenders and IT
support personnel at victim organizations. The just-in-time access method provisions
privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege
(as well as the zero-trust model) by setting network-wide policy to automatically disable admin
accounts at the AD level. As needed, individual users can submit requests through an
automated process that enables access to a system for a set timeframe.

Protective Controls and Architecture
•

•

•
•

Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate lateral movement by a
threat actor, ransomware, or other malware. Use network monitoring tools and host-based
logs and monitoring tools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools
are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and
uncommon network connections for each host.
Implement a firewall and configure it to block Domain Name System (DNS) responses from
outside the enterprise network or drop Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets.
Review which admin services need to be accessible externally and allow those explicitly,
blocking all others by default.
o U.S. Defense Industrial Base organizations may sign up for the NSA Cybersecurity
Collaboration Center’s Protective Domain Name System (PDNS) services.
Enable web application firewalls to mitigate application-level DDoS attacks.
Implement a multi-content delivery network (CDN) solution. This will minimize the threat of
DDoS attacks by distributing and balancing web traffic across a network.

Vulnerability and Configuration Management
•

Use an antivirus programs that uses heuristics and reputational ratings to check a file’s
prevalence and digital signature prior to execution. Note: organizations should assess the
risks inherent in their software supply chain (including its security/antivirus software supply
chain) in light of the existing threat landscape.
o Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets
using up-to-date signatures.
o Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are
identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.

•

Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and
mitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security
weaknesses.
Disable all unnecessary ports and protocols.
o Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary
ports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control
activity.
o Turn off or disable any unnecessary services (e.g., PowerShell) or functionality within
devices.

•

•
•
•

Identify business-to-business VPNs and block high-risk protocols.
Ensure OT hardware is in read-only mode.
Enable strong spam filters.
o Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.
o Filter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching end users.

o
•

•

•
•

Implement a user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious
websites or opening malicious attachments.

Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that
are necessary and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Threat
actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.
Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your
organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or
hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.
Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to
execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.
Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content from
running.

Responding to Cyber Incidents
U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge network defenders
of critical infrastructure organizations to exercise due diligence in identifying indicators of malicious
activity. Organizations detecting potential APT or ransomware activity in their IT or OT networks
should:
1. Immediately isolate affected systems.
2. For DDoS attacks:
a. Identify the source address originating the attack via the SIEM or logging service. If the
attack is originating from a single pool of IP addresses, block IP traffic from suspected
IPs via access control lists or by contacting your internet service provider (ISP).
b. Enable firewall rate limiting to restrict the amount of IP traffic coming in from suspected
IP addresses
c. Notify your ISP and enable remote triggered blackhole (RTBH).
3. Secure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup
data with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.
4. Collect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.
5. Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter
expertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that
could enable follow-on exploitation.
6. Report incidents to appropriate cyber and law enforcement authorities:
•

U.S organizations: share information about incidents and anomalous activity to
CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or the FBI
via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or

Page 16 of 17 | Product ID: AA22-110A

TLP: WHITE

UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ

Product ID: AA22-110A

TLP:WHITE

CyWatch@fbi.gov. For ransomware incidents, organizations can also report to the U.S.
Secret Service via a U.S. Secret Service Field Office.
•

Australian organizations: if you have questions about this advice or have indications
that your environment has been compromised, call the ACSC at 1300 CYBER1 (1300
292 371). To report an incident see cyber.gov.au/acsc/report.

•

Canadian organizations: report incidents by emailing CCCS at contact@cyber.gc.ca.

•

New Zealand organizations: if your organization requires assistance from the
National Cyber Security Centre, contact them directly via telephone at (04) 498-7654
or via email at ncscincidents@ncsc.govt.nz.

•

UK organizations: report a significant cybersecurity incident at ncsc.gov.uk/report-anincident (monitored 24 hours) or, for urgent assistance, call 03000 200 973.

For additional guidance on responding to a ransomware incident, see the CISA-Multi-State
Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.
See the joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United
States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for guidance on
hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling.
Additionally, CISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage U.S. critical infrastructure owners and operators to
see CISA’s Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks.
Although tailored to federal civilian branch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures
for planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail
each step for both incident and vulnerability response.
Note: U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities strongly discourage paying
a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional
organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or
fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.
