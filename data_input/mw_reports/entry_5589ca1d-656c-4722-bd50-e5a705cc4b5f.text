An In-Depth Look at Play Ransomware
avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/an-in-depth-look-at-play-ransomware

Executive Summary
Play ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt) is a new ransomware operation that launched in
June 2022. The operation has amassed a steady stream of victims across the world. Play
has recently been in the news for attacking Argentina’s Judiciary of Cordoba and the
German hotel chain “H-Hotels”. Play’s attacks focus on organizations in the Latin American
region – Brazil being their primary target. They have also been observed deploying attacks
on India, Hungary, Spain, and the Netherlands.
Play is known for their big game hunting tactics, such as using Cobalt Strike for postcompromise and SystemBC RAT for persistence. They have recently started exploiting the
ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange. The group also has similar tactics and
techniques to the ransomware groups Hive and Nokoyawa, leading researchers to believe
Play is operated by the same people. Let’s take a look at Play ransomware, their tactics and
techniques, as well as how organizations can protect themselves from this kind of threat
actor.

play ransomware
Play was discovered in June 2022 after several victims of their ransomware attacks
appeared in Bleeping Computer forums. Play’s ransomware name stems from its behavior,
as the extension .play is added after file encryption. The ransomware note left behind also
contains the single word PLAY, as well as the group’s contact email address.
Not long after victims started reporting attacks in Bleeping Computer forums, Play targeted
Argentina’s Judiciary of Cordoba. The attack took place in August 2022 and the Judiciary
had to shut down their IT systems, as well as their online portal as a result. The Judiciary
was forced to use pen and paper for submitting official documents. The Argentinian
publication, Clarin, reported that the attack was the “worst attack on public institutions in
history.”

Although the Judiciary did not go into detail, journalist Luis Ernest Zegarra confirmed via
Twitter that the Judiciary was hit by ransomware that appends the .play extension to
encrypted files. The ransomware note that Play leaves behind is not lengthy and is unusually
simple. The note is only made at the root of a hard dive (C:\) and only contains the word
PLAY and an email address for victims to contact. This kind of simplicity is not usual for
ransomware operators.

Although not confirmed, researchers suspect that Play was able to breach the Judiciary via a
list of leaked Globant employee email addresses. The attack on Globant took place in March
2022 and the leaked email addresses may have allowed Play to launch a phishing attack to
steal credentials.

tactics & techniques
PROXYNOTSHELL
Towards the end of December 2022, Play was observed using a method to exploit two
ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft exchange to gain initial access in environments.
The ProxyNotShell flaws are:
CVE-2022-41040 – Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
4/12

CVE-2022-41082 – Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
The flaws impact Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019. If successful, an attacker could
exploit ProxyNotShell to elevate privileges to run PowerShell in the context of the system,
gaining arbitrary or remote code execution on vulnerable servers. Although the vulnerabilities
were patched by Microsoft in November 2022, Play was able to bypass URL rewrite
mitigations for the Autodiscover endpoint implemented by Microsoft.
Next, Play was able to leverage legitimate Plink and AnyDesk executables to maintain
access. They also performed anti-forensics techniques on the server, attempting to hide their
activity. The security researchers at CrowdStrike investigated several Play ransomware
intrusions where they suspected the threat actors used ProxyNotShell as their entry vector.
However, after analyzing and after reviewing their logs, they determined that there was no
evidence of exploitation of CVE-2022-41040 for initial access but “corresponding requests
were made directly through the Outlook Web Application (OWA) endpoint - signifying a
previously undisclosed exploit method for Exchange.”
According to Security Affairs, a security researcher from Huntress Labs discovered Play’s
tool set and shared it through MegaUpload. The tools include a Python script “poc.py”
(which led CrowdStrike to replicate the logs generated in recent Play ransomware attacks).

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER GROUPS
As previously stated, Play’s name originated from the .play extension that is added after
encrypting files. The threat actors have similar behavior and tactics to HIVE and Nokoyawa
ransomware. The threat actor was observed using similar file names and file paths of their
respective tools and payloads. Trend Micro also found evidence hinting that the operators
behind Nokoyawa are associated with the operators behind HIVE, as there are many
similarities between their attack chains.
One of the ways that Play is set apart from HIVE and Nokoyawa is through their use of
AdFind – a command-line query tool which collects information from Active Directory (AD).
HIVE has been observed using tools such as the TrojanSpy.DATASPY trojan to gather victim
information. Play, HIVE, and Nokoyawa may not share all the same indicators, but their
shared tactics and tools indicate that they are affiliated in some way.
Trend Micro also found evidence of a possible connection between Play and Quantum
ransomware. Quantum is known for being a splinter group of Conti. The ransomware
operation was taken over by Conti Team Two in April 2022, but the group kept Quantum’s
original name. Quantum is also known for employing their version of BazarCall, called
Jormungandr, and hiring people who specialize in OSINT, spamming, design, and call center
operations.

Trend Micro’s researchers stated that the Cobalt Strike beacons used in Play’s attacks, have
the same watermark that was dropped by the Emotet and SVCReady botnets – two botnets
that have been observed in Quantum ransomware attacks.

As you can see above, Play’s infection chain includes using compromised valid accounts or
unpatched Fortinet SSL VPN vulnerabilities to gain access to organization’s networks. They
use living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) during their attacks (i.e., using WinSCP for data
exfiltration and Task Manger for Local Security Authority Server Service for dumping and
credential cracking). Like other ransomware gangs, Play uses the double extortion model
against their victims. The threat actor exfiltrates data before deploying their ransomware and
archives the victim’s files using WinRAR before uploading them to sharing sites.
Regarding execution, Trend Micro observed Play using scheduled tasks and PsExec during
execution. The ransomware gang also creates a GPO, which can control user and machine
settings in the AD. Play uses batch files to execute PsExec, which executes processes on
other systems and allows the spread of the ransomware. This also assists Play in its
reconnaissance activities.

6/12

After gaining access to accounts, Play uses the accounts as a persistence mechanism. If
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is disabled on their victim’s system, Play will enable it by
executing “netsh” commands – establishing inbound connects within the victim’s system.
Next Mimikatz is used to extract high privilege credentials from memory. To avoid detection,
GMER, IOBit, Process Hacker, and PowerTool is used to disable antivirus tools and
monitoring solutions. Wevtutil or a batch script is used to remove indicators that show Play
was present in a system, while Windows Defender is disabled through PowerShell or
command script.
Play uses the following tools to move laterally across a victim’s system:
Cobalt Strike SMB beacon
SystemBC
Empire
Mimikatz
To avoid triggering network data transfer, Play splits victim data into chunks before
exfiltration. To compress the files in .RAR format, they use WinRaR.

what organization's can do
here are some best practices that can help protect organizations and end users from
ransomware operators such as Play, those best practices include:
If running Exchange servers, ensure they are fully patched and running on Windows
Server 2019. Or move to M365 and a fully hosted environment.
Block or restrict the use of psexec within your environment.
Minimize the use of administrator accounts (at both the local and domain level). All
domain administrators should have standard accounts for day-to-day use and
additional administrator accounts that are only used when required.
Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software to detect and block aggregation and
exfiltration of sensitive data.
Where possible disable the use of Remote Desktop Protocol via GPO and do not allow
users to install other remote access software.
Back up all data and test those backups regularly. Even if you become the victim of a
ransomware attack, your business operations won’t be severely interrupted, and your
data will be retrievable.
Install updates regularly – maintain patch management protocols and keep your
operating systems and applications up to date. This action will deter threat actors from
exploiting software vulnerabilities.
Using phishing resistant MFA on all accounts, especially VPNs, webmail, and accounts
with access to critical systems will prevent attackers from performing lateral movement
inside a network.
7/12

Deploy and monitor Endpoint Detection and Response or antivirus software and ensure
that your analysts are trained to determine at what point of the cyber attack the
detection relates to.
Remember, relying on outdated tools and point solutions will only compromise your network
or system. Organizations should rely on modern technology to detect complex attacks.

Reach out to your Service Delivery Manager or Account Executive if you need
assistance applying any of the above recommendations.

avertium's recommendations
The FBI and CISA urge all organizations to apply the following recommendations to
prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents:

8/12

Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your
organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software
or hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.

Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or
proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location
(i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).

Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and
domain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.

Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or
unrecognized accounts.

Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can
help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and
access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.

Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.

Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and
lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If
threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating
privileges and/or moving laterally.
