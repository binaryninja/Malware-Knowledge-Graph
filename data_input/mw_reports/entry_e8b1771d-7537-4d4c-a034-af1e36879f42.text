Introduction
Recently Check Point Research discovered new evidence of an ongoing cyber espionage
operation against several national government entities in the Asia Paciﬁc (APAC) region. This
operation, which we were able to attribute to the Naikon APT group, used a new backdoor
named Aria-body, in order to take control of the victims’ networks.
In 2015, an extensive report by ThreatConnect and Defense Group revealed the APT group’s
infrastructure and even exposed one of the group’s members. Since this report, no new evidence
has come to light of further activity by the group, suggesting that they had either gone silent,
increased their emphasis on stealth, or drastically changed their methodology of operations. That
is, until now.
In the following report, we will describe the tactics, techniques, procedures and infrastructure that
have been used by the Naikon APT group over the 5 years since the last report, and offer some
insight into how they were able to remain under the radar.

Naikon APT: Cyber Espionage Reloaded - Check Point Research

By comparing with previously reported activity, we can conclude that the Naikon APT group has
been persistently targeting the same region in the last decade. In operations following the original
2015 report, we have observed the use of a backdoor named Aria-body against several national
governments, including Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar
and Brunei.
The targeted government entities include ministries of foreign affairs, science and technology
ministries, as well as government-owned companies. Interestingly, the group has been observed
expanding its footholds on the various governments within APAC by launching attacks from one
government entity that has already been breached, to try and infect another. In one case, a
foreign embassy unknowingly sent malware-infected documents to the government of its host
country, showing how the hackers are exploiting trusted, known contacts and using those them to
inﬁltrate new organizations and extend their espionage network.
Given the characteristics of the victims and capabilities presented by the group, it is evident that
the group’s purpose is to gather intelligence and spy on the countries whose Governments it has
targeted. This includes not only locating and collecting speciﬁc documents from infected
computers and networks within government departments, but also extracting data from removable
drives, taking screenshots and keylogging, and of course harvesting the stolen data for
espionage. And if that wasn’t enough, to evade detection when accessing remote servers through
sensitive governmental networks, the group compromised and used servers within the infected
ministries as command and control servers to collect, relay and route the stolen data.

Targeted countries

Infection Chains
Throughout our research, we witnessed several different infection chains being used to deliver
the Aria-body backdoor. Our investigation started when we observed a malicious email sent from
a government embassy in APAC to an Australian state government, named The Indians
Way.doc . This RTF ﬁle, which was infected (weaponized) with the RoyalRoad exploit builder,
drops a loader named intel.wll into the target PC’s Word startup folder. The loader in turn
tries to download and execute the next stage payload from spool.jtjewifyn[.]com .
This is not the ﬁrst time we have encountered this version of the RoyalRoad malware which
drops a ﬁlename named intel.wll – the Vicious Panda APT group, whose activities we
reviewed in March 2020, utilizes a very similar variant.

Overall, during our investigation we observed several different infection methods:
An RTF ﬁle utilizing the RoyalRoad weaponizer.
Archive ﬁles that contain a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL, to be used in a DLL
hijacking technique, taking advantage of legitimate executables such as Outlook and
Avast proxy, to load a malicious DLL.
Directly via an executable ﬁle, which serves as a loader.

Infection chain examples

Infrastructure
In recent operations, the attackers used the same hosting and DNS services for most of their
C&C servers: GoDaddy as the registrar and Alibaba for hosting the infrastructure. On several
occasions, the attackers even reused the same IP address with more than one domain:

Maltego – latest infrastructure overview

A full view of the entire infrastructure is available here.
In order to get a clearer picture of how the attackers operated their infrastructure throughout the
years, we have plotted the various malicious domains, according to the ASN they were hosted on,
based on periodic passive DNS information. The results are presented in the ﬁgure below:

Correlation between domains and ASNs over time

Observations:
Several domains were utilized for a very long time.
Multiple domains jumped to the same new ASN within a short time frame.
Since 2019, most of the infrastructure has been concentrated on ASN 45102 (Alibaba).
In some occasions, the attackers would change the IP address / server, on the same ASN
(represented by two consecutive incidental ASN’s on the graph).
In addition, one of the more interesting infrastructure properties we observed, is the possible use
of hacked government infrastructures as C&C servers. In one of the samples we analyzed,
outllib.dll ( 63d64cd53f6da3fd6c5065b2902a0162 ), there is a backup C&C server which

is conﬁgured as 202.90.141[.]25 – an IP which belongs to the Philippines department of
science and technology.

Tool Analysis
In the following section, we will dive into the technical analysis of the Aria-body backdoor, utilized
throughout the observed activity, as well as an analysis of the loader executable that comes
before it.
Utilizing the loader at an early stage of an infection allows the attackers to establish a persistent
presence on the target’s network, as well as perform basic reconnaissance, before using their
more advanced tools. While we observed Aria-body backdoor variants being compiled as early
as 2018, we have observed Aria-body’s loaders going back to 2017.

Loader Analysis
The functionality of the Aria-body loader has not changed signiﬁcantly since 2017, but the
implementation varied from version to version. This loader appears to be speciﬁcally created
for the Aria-body backdoor.
Overall, the loader is responsible for the following tasks:
1. Establish persistence via the Startup folder or the Run registry key (some variants).
2. Inject itself to another process such as rundll32.exe and dllhost.exe (some
variants).
3. Decrypt two blobs: Import Table and the loader conﬁguration.
4. Utilize a DGA algorithm if required.
5. Contact the embedded / calculated C&C address in order to retrieve the next stage
payload.
6. Decrypt the received payload DLL (Aria-body backdoor).
7. Load and execute an exported function of the DLL – calculated using djb2 hashing
algorithm.

Main logic of the loader – entering dga_method
only if dga_seed ≠ 0

Loader: Conﬁguration & DGA
The loader conﬁguration comes encrypted and contains the following information: C&C domain,
port, user-agent and a seed for the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). In case seed is not
zero, the loader uses a DGA method to generate its C&C domain, based on the seed and the
calendar day of the communication. The conﬁguration of the loader is decrypted using the
following algorithm:
def decrypt_buf(buf):
k=8
j=5
for i in range(len(buf)):
xor_byte = (k + j) % 0xff
buf[i] = buf[i] ^ xor_byte
j=k
k = xor_byte
Conﬁguration decryption algorithm

Naikon APT: Cyber Espionage Reloaded - Check Point Research

The DGA method is fully described in Appendix B.

Loader: C&C Communication
After getting the C&C domain, the loader contacts it to download the next and ﬁnal stage of the
infection chain. Although it sounds simple, the attackers operate the C&C server in a limited daily
window, going online only for a few hours each day, making it harder to gain access to the
advanced parts of the infection chain.

Loader: Next stage payload
At the next and ﬁnal stage of the loader, the downloaded RAT is decrypted using a single byte
XOR key, received from the C&C. Once the RAT’s DLL is downloaded and decrypted, the DLL is
loaded into the memory. The loader will then check the exported function against a hardcoded
djb2 hash value, and will call it upon a match.

Aria-body RAT analysis
The downloaded payload is a custom RAT dubbed Aria-body, based on the name given by the
authors: aria-body-dllX86.dll .
Although the below analysis is of the 32bit variant malware, we have observed a 64bit variant as
well, with similar functionality.

Strings found inside the “Aria-body” backdoor

The RAT includes rather common capabilities of a backdoor, including:
Create/Delete Files/Directories
Take a screenshot
Search ﬁle
Launch ﬁles using ShellExecute
Enumerate process loaded modules
Gather ﬁles’ metadata
Gather TCP and UDP table status listing
Close a TCP session
Collect OS information
Verify location using checkip.amazonaws.com
(Optional) Inter-process pipe based communication
Some of Aria-body variations also included other modules such as:

Reverse socks proxy module – added by February 2018
Loading extensions module – added by December 2019
All the supported functionality of the backdoor is described in the table of Appendix A.

Unique Characteristics
In the following section, we go over some of the techniques by which the backdoor was
implemented, and highlight the characteristics that might help other researchers recognize this
backdoor and correlate it with other samples.

Initialization
As previously mentioned, the backdoor contains an exported function, which the previous loader
calls after loading the payload into the memory. Upon executing the backdoor, it initializes a struct
named MyDerived and several structs used for HTTP and TCP connection.

Information Gathering
Aria-body starts with gathering data on the victim’s machine, including:
Host-name, computer-name, username, domain name, windows version, processor ~MHz,
MachineGuid, 64bit or not, and public IP (using checkip.amazonaws.com ).

Aria-body using checkip.amazonaws.com service to get victim’s IP

Naikon APT: Cyber Espionage Reloaded - Check Point Research

This data is gathered into an information structure which the RAT zips with an 8 bytes random
generated password, which is then XORed with one byte.

C&C Communication
The communication to the C&C server is available by either HTTP or TCP protocols. The
malware decides which protocol to use by a ﬂag in the conﬁguration of the loader. The collected
data is sent to the C&C domain along with the XORed password, and the XOR key in the
following format:

C&C communication structure

Whether the message is sent by TCP or HTTP, the payload format is the same. However, when
HTTP is selected, the following GET request format is used:
https://%s:%d/list.html?q=<random string>

After the initial request to the C&C server, the backdoor then keeps listening to additional
commands from the server. When a command is received, it is matched against a list of
commands, and executed accordingly. A full list of supported commands is available in Appendix
A.

The Outlook DLL Variant
During our research we have found another, quite a unique variant of Aria-body, uploaded to
VirusTotal from the Philippines. This variant’s DLL was named outllib.dll , and it was part of
a RAR archive named Office.rar . It utilized a DLL side-loading technique, abusing an old
Outlook executable.
What was unusual in this variant was the fact that there has no loader as part of the infection
chain, unlike all the other versions of Aria-body. As a result, it did not get any conﬁguration from
the loader, and included hardcoded conﬁguration within it.
The payload has two different C&C domains:
blog.toptogear[.]com – which it gets by XORing an encrypted string with the byte
0x15 .
202.90.141[.]25 – an IP associated with a Philippine government website, which is

being used in case that the ﬁrst C&C domain cannot be resolved.

This variant also has some extra features that the
main variant of Aria-body does not include, such as
a USB-monitor module. On the other hand, this
variant is missing the keylogger component and the
reverse-socks module, observed with the main Ariabody variants. This evidence suggests that this is
an out of scope variant of the backdoor, tailored for
a speciﬁc operation.
Moreover, we have seen that Aria-body’s main
variant has a version that was compiled sometime
after outlib.dll variant was, and some strings
within this variant could suggest that it was a test
variant of this special version:
Finally, this version of Aria-body includes the
following string:

Usage of Philippines govt’ C&C server as
backup

“TEST” string as part of the connection struct of
“outllib.dll”

c:\users\bruce\desktop\20190813\arn\agents\verinfo.h , with the “ar” in “arn” possibly

standing for “Aria”.

Naikon APT: Cyber Espionage Reloaded - Check Point Research

We were able to attribute our campaign to the Naikon APT group using several similarities we
observed to the previously disclosed information about Naikon’s activity by Kaspersky in 2015: 1,
2. In this original operation, the Naikon APT group utilized a backdoor against different
government institutions in APAC.
Going forward, we will refer to the backdoor analyzed by Kaspersky as XsFunction due to PDB
path found in one of its samples:
g:\MyProjects\xsFunction\Release\DLL.pdb

XsFunction is a full featured backdoor which supports 48 different commands. It allows the
attacker to gain full control on the victim computer, perform ﬁle and process operations, shell
commands execution, as well as to upload and download data and additional plugins.
We were able to ﬁnd several similarities to previous operations (besides the obvious overlap in
targeting), as well as speciﬁc similarities to the XsFunction backdoor.

String Similarity
Aria-body backdoor has several debug strings that describe the functionality of the malware.
Some of these exact debug strings, can also be found in the XsFunction backdoor:

Hashing Function Similarity
Both XsFunction and Aria-body loaders utilize the same hashing algorithm djb2 to ﬁnd which
exported function should be run. In XsFunction the name of that function is XS02 and in Ariabody it is AzManager .

Code Similarity
Some functions in the Aria-body backdoor are identical to functions used in the old XsFunction
backdoor. One example is the function which gathers information about the installed software on
the PC:

Infrastructure overlap
Four of our C&C servers shared IPs with mopo3[.]net domain, this domain resolves to the
same IP as the domain mentioned in Kaspersky’s report: myanmartech.vicp[.]net .

Maltego – graph of infrastructure overlap

Conclusion
In this campaign, we uncovered the latest iteration of what seems to be a long-running Chinesebased operation against various government entities in APAC. This speciﬁc campaign leveraged
both common toolsets like RoyalRoad RTF weaponizer, as well as a specially crafted backdoor
named Aria-body.
While the Naikon APT group has kept under the radar for the past 5 years, it appears that they
have not been idle. In fact, quite the opposite. By utilizing new server infrastructure, everchanging loader variants, in-memory ﬁleless loading, as well as a new backdoor – the Naikon
APT group was able to prevent analysts from tracing their activity back to them.

Check Point SandBlast Agent protects against such APT attacks, and is capable of
preventing them from the very ﬁrst step.
