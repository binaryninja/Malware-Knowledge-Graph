ChChes – Malware that Communicates with
C&C Servers Using Cookie Headers
Since around October 2016, JPCERT/CC has been confirming emails that are sent to
Japanese organisations with a ZIP file attachment containing executable files. The
targeted emails, which impersonate existing persons, are sent from free email address
services available in Japan. Also, the executable files’ icons are disguised as Word
documents. When the recipient executes the file, the machine is infected with malware
called ChChes.
This blog article will introduce characteristics of ChChes, including its communication.
ZIP files attached to Targeted Emails
While some ZIP files attached to the targeted emails in this campaign contain executable
files only, in some cases they also contain dummy Word documents. Below is the
example of the latter case.

PlugX”

In the above example, two files with similar names are listed: a dummy Word document
and an executable file whose icon is disguised as a Word document. By running this
executable file, the machine will be infected with ChChes. JPCERT/CC has confirmed the
executable files that have signatures of a specific code signing certificate. The dummy
Word document is harmless, and its contents are existing online articles related to the file
name “Why Donald Trump won”. The details of the code signing certificate is described in
Appendix A.

Communication of ChChes

2016 in Review: Top Cyber Security
Trends in Japan

ChChes is a type of malware that communicates with specific sites using HTTP to receive
commands and modules. There are only few functions that ChChes can execute by itself.
This means it expands its functions by receiving modules from C&C servers and loading
them on the memory.

The following is an example of HTTP GET request that ChChes sends. Sometimes,
HEAD method is used instead of GET.

The value in the Cookie field of the HTTP request that ChChes first sends (Request 1)
contains encrypted data starting with ‘A’. The following is an example of data sent.

As you can see, the path for HTTP request takes /[random string].htm, however, the
value for the Cookie field is not random but encrypted strings corresponding to actual
data used in the communication with C&C servers. The value can be decrypted using the
below Python script.

The following is the flow of communication after the machine is infected.

Figure 3: Example of the first data sent

As indicated in Figure 3, the data which is sent contains information including computer
name. The format of the encrypted data differs depending on ChChes’s version. The
details are specified in Appendix B.
As a response to Request 1, ChChes receives strings of an ID identifying the
infected machine from C&C servers (Response 1). The ID is contained in the Set-Cookie
field as shown below.

Figure 4: Example response to the first request

Request for Modules and Commands
Next, ChChes sends an HTTP request to receive modules and commands (Request 2). At
this point, the following data starting with ‘B’ is encrypted and contained in the Cookie
field.
B[ID to identify the infected machine]

As a response to Request 2, encrypted modules and commands (Response 2) are sent
from C&C servers. The following shows an example of received modules and commands
after decryption.

Figure 5: Decrypted data of modules and commands received

Commands are sent either together with modules as a single data (as above), or by itself.
Afterwards, execution results of the received command are sent to C&C servers, and it
returns to the process to receive modules and commands. This way, by repeatedly
receiving commands from C&C servers, the infected machines will be controlled remotely.
JPCERT/CC’s research has confirmed modules with the following functions, which are
thought to be the bot function of ChChes.
Encrypt communication using AES
Execute shell commands
Upload files
Download files
Load and run DLLs
View tasks of bot commands
Especially, it was confirmed that the module that encrypts the communication with AES is

received in a relatively early stage after the infection. With this feature, communication
with C&C servers after this point will be encrypted in AES on top of the existing encryption
method.
Summary
ChChes is a relatively new kind of malware which has been seen since around October
2016. As this may be continually used for targeted attacks, JPCERT/CC will keep an eye
on ChChes and attack activities using the malware.
The hash values of the samples demonstrated here are described in Appendix C. The
malware’s destination hosts that JPCERT/CC has confirmed are listed in Appendix D. We
recommend that you check if your machines are communicating with such hosts.
Thanks for reading.
