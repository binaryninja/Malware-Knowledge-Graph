August 24, 2021

On August 23, 2021, the YouTube channel Russian OSINT published an interview with the
LockBit 2.0 ransomware gang in Russian. KELA translated the full interview.

Main points:
LockBit’s representative brags that no other RaaS affiliate program provides the
same conditions for affiliates, including their own stealer for a victim’s data,
paying ransoms directly to the affiliates’ wallets, and more. He claims LockBit 2.0
is the fastest ransomware.
According to LockBit’s representative companies did not become better at protecting
themselves despite the wave of ransomware attacks in recent years.
The ransomware ban on forums did not prevent LockBit from recruiting new
affiliates. In fact, it only helped them to compete with new RaaS programs since the
latter are less recognizable without a presence on the forums.
A victim’s location is not important for LockBit, they care only about the
company’s revenue. LockBit claims it will not attack healthcare, education, charitable
organizations, and social services.
LockBit supposes the supply chain attacks (like the Kaseya attack by REvil) will
happen more often in the near future.
LockBit supposes that the guiding principle behind companies’ decision whether
to pay the ransom or not is potential loss calculations.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the migration to remote work have benefited
LockBit, making it easier to infect targets.
Two reasons for the prevalence of American and European companies among
ransomware victims are, in LockBit’s opinion, the fact that cyber insurance is more
developed in those countries, and that some of the world’s wealthiest companies
are located there.
When asked how to protect from ransomware attacks, LockBit suggests that
companies should employ a full-time Red Team, regularly update their software,
maintain employee awareness of social engineering, and invest 5-10% of the
corporate budget in cybersecurity, depending on the size and complexity of the
corporate network.

Question (Q): What does it mean - LockBit? Do you have a story behind this
name?
1/12

Answer (A): “Lock” is a lock and “Bit” is a unit of measure for the amount of information in
computer systems.

Q: Why do you think you continue to work successfully while many other
ransomware groups are forced to close their business?
A: Because we enjoy our work and we take anonymity seriously.

Q: Compared to other ransomware - Maze, REvil, Conti, DarkSide - how does
your product differ from them from a technical point of view?
A: On our blog in the onion network [TOR – KELA] there is a comparison table. We are in the
first place in terms of the encryption speed and the speed of dumping the company data. The
distribution and encryption processes are automated. Just one [payload – KELA] launch on
the domain controller is enough – after the shortest period of time, the entire corporate
network is encrypted.

Q: The year 2021 has become a real headache for all big companies that
have been attacked by ransomware. What is the reason we have not heard
anything like this in 2019-2020?
A: A lot of information in the press, big money – it attracts more and more people to this
business. At the same time, the risks are growing.

Q: In general, how do you treat other ransomware-as-a-service [operations KELA] - neutrally, positively, negatively?
A: We have a negative attitude towards ransomware gangs that encrypt healthcare and
educational institutions. We prefer to attack those who are, like us, “business sharks”.

Q: What LockBit attacks do you think were the loudest ones?
A: A lot of noise around the attack is bad. A silent attack no one knew about is good for the
company’s reputation, and our income.

Q: The Lockbit 2.0 update has recently appeared. What are the most
significant changes in a new version of the software?

2/12

A: We continue to move in our own direction. LockBit, unlike other RaaS, is, first of all, a
software complex and only then a set of related services. Our mission is to provide a tool that
will help to carry out an attack as soon as possible. The faster the attack is carried out, the
less the risk that the attack will be repelled. It also means more companies can be encrypted
in one working day. The most significant changes are the increase in encryption speed
without losing quality and, of course, a stealer [StealBit – KELA] that automatically
downloads all important data of a company to the administrative panel. Clients of the affiliate
program [affiliates of the RaaS program – KELA] no longer need to mess with servers and
cloud storage services, wasting time on the routine job and subsequently losing data after a
first complaint filed to the cloud provider. In addition, now all the company’s data is stored in
our TOR blog with the ability to download each file separately thanks to a listing [LockBit’s
blog posts now include a live file explorer through which one can see the exact files that
were leaked and download each one separately – KELA]. There is no other affiliate program
on the planet with such an arsenal.

Q: What does the organizational structure of LockBit look like? Does it
resemble the Italian mafia?
A: It is a classic organized crime group, all the participants get their share [of income –
KELA]. It doesn’t resemble the Italian mafia. In real life, it’s better when no one knows what
we do, especially relatives. A human factor is the weakest point of any criminal group.

Q: Did you notice any changes in the level of companies’ security - now that
the ransomware topic is so widely discussed?
A: No. Firstly, companies do not want to spend money on protecting a corporate network and
hiring highly paid specialists. Secondly, any protection measure can be bypassed.

Q: How much have you earned in recent years in USD?
A: Enough for a comfortable life. Money loves silence.

LockBit’s interview on YouTube

Q: Why do some lockers [ransomware - KELA] require a ransom in Bitcoins
and others in Monero - what is it related to?
A: Security or the convenience of cashing out. Only in our affiliate program, a client
communicates with encrypted companies by himself. We are not intermediaries and we
cannot steal money from anyone – unlike what Avaddon, DarkSide, and REvil did. We do not
limit our clients in their choice of currency, it all depends on their priorities, even Dogecoin [is
accepted – KELA]. Payments are carried out exclusively to our clients’ wallets, and then they
transfer to us 20% of the ransom.

Q: Special services of all the world are actively working to fight with lockers
following the attacks on Kaseya, Colonial Pipeline, JBS. Did you feel such
pressure on yourself from law enforcement?
A: We did not. You can only feel the pressure of law enforcement when they have already
come to you with an angle grinder and jumped into your window. It is impossible to pressure
us by other methods

Q: REvil earlier declared they are apolitical. What is your attitude to politics?
Do you have similar views?
A: For us, the unfriendly attitude of the West [towards Russia – KELA] is beneficial. It makes
it possible to have such an aggressive business and feel calm operating from the CIS
countries.
4/12

Q: Western media often associate the Russian language of correspondence
on forums with Russia. If we talk not about you but about your competitors is there a practice of fouling the trail? Let's say to communicate with
journalists in Russian, and within their infrastructure - only in English?
A: All media are under control and not apolitical. In the West, Russia is represented as the
aggressor and the main enemy. Therefore, for the West it is profitable, at any opportunity, to
blame Russia for all sins in order to form a negative image about the main enemy. These
accusations are not necessarily based on something. The West is behaving in the same way
towards China. The United States of America were initially a colony of invaders that
exterminated the indigenous population of America and prior to today has been regularly
violating human rights. It is not surprising the Black Lives Matter movement appeared in the
US. Also, the US is essentially a printing machine [of money – KELA] and thanks to this it
behaves as a master of the world. Therefore, you should not pay attention to what the
Western media say. The practice of fouling the trails on purpose exists.

Q: Following the attack on Colonial Pipeline, ransomware was banned on
forums. In response, DDoS attacks [against the forums - KELA] were carried
out, but no one took responsibility. What is heard backstage, can you
somehow comment on the situation?
A: The attacks were carried out by some people who felt betrayed by their beloved forums
who turned out to be cowards. After a while, the insult receded and these DDoS attacks were
gone too.

Q: How are you managing to attract adverts [affiliates - KELA] now when all
topics related to ransomware are banned on forums?
A: For us, it is easier because we have a perfect reputation and we are famous all over the
world. For new affiliate programs, it will be harder to announce themselves and earn a
reputation during the information blockade. So, this taboo on forums did us a favor. We do
not need a large number of adverts because we know how the Indian fairytale about the
[Golden] antelope has ended [an Indian fairytale with anti-greed morale – KELA]. When a
certain amount of quantity and quality is reached, we close the recruiting process. It is easy
to open an affiliate program but it is an art to keep it open.

Q: How do you choose the next target for your attacks? What is the main
factor? Do you have any preferences for the region where your potential
target is located?
A: The bigger the company’s capitalization is – the better. There are no [other] main factors.
If there is a target, then it needs to be “worked out” [attacked – KELA]. It does not matter
where the target is situated, we attack everyone. There is no time and desire for preparing
for an attack on a specific target because there is always enough work. Our targets are
businesses, capitalists.

Q: Do you have any moral code in terms of choosing targets? For example,
not to attack healthcare or educational organizations.
A: We do not attack healthcare, education, charitable organizations, social services –
everything that contributes to the development of personality and sensible values from the
survival of the species perspective. Healthcare, medicine, education, charitable
6/12

organizations, and social services remain intact.

Q: What victim companies have been paying a ransom more often than
others? Why in your opinion?
A: The victims who are paying are the ones who do not make backups and poorly protect
sensitive information, regardless of the industry.

Q: Will the lockers go bankrupt if authorities around the world will introduce
a ban on paying ransoms at the legislative level for companies in the US,
Europe, CIS, Asia, in the Middle East? Since the money for the maintenance
of their infrastructure will simply be nowhere to be taken.
A: There will be no such law that will prohibit companies from paying a ransom. Often, the
information [that was stolen] is strategically important. Losing this information is a huge loss
for a company, it may cost a leading position in the market. It can turn into serious damage to
the country’s economy. Authorities won’t make such a rash step.

Q: Could such events as the Olympic Games in Japan serve as a catalyst for
an increase of attacks on a certain region, in particular, the hosting country?
A: For companies, it always makes sense to worry about their cyber security, regardless of
the Olympic Games. The timing doesn’t matter.

Q: What do you think about REvil’s attack on Kaseya? Is it possible to
expect a new stage in the development of the ransomware business, namely,
attacking the supply chain? What is the likelihood that this kind of attack will
occur more often in the near future?
A: We think that REvil has an excellent advert who performed this attack. Such affiliates are
always very valuable since they form the image and authority of the affiliate program. Such
attacks for sure will be carried out in the future since there is no flawless software.
Vulnerabilities are endless and everywhere.

Q: In your opinion, what guides the companies’ decision whether to pay the
ransom or not?
A: Potential loss. However, sometimes you stumble on guys with principles. I’ll repeat myself
– we are dealing with capitalists in the first place, which means they assess the risks,
probable benefits, or losses from the deal.

7/12

Q: Do you offer any discounts on the ransom, if the company contacts you
quickly and operates properly during negotiations?
A: Almost always. Our target is to streamline the attacks.

Q: How did the global COVID-19 pandemic - and the mass migration to
remote work - affect you, and did it change your strategy?
A: [It influenced – KELA] positively, of course. Many employees started working remotely
from personal computers, which are easier to infect with a virus and steal account
information used to access the companies.

Q: Why are US and EU companies targeted more often by ransomware than
others? There is an opinion that one of the reasons is the language barrier:
companies from countries with more complex languages are attacked less
often; is it the reason?
A: The insurance in this sphere [i.e. insurance in the case of ransomware – KELA] is more
developed in the US and EU, and the largest number of the world’s wealthiest companies is
concentrated there.

Q: Sometimes lockers change their names and do a “rebranding”. Will this
tendency persist, in your opinion?
A: It becomes more difficult to enter this business, more money and knowledge are required.
It makes no sense to change the name if you are honest with your clients and hold your
reputation dear. Trust is being earned in a matter of years but is lost in a moment – like it was
the case with Avaddon, DarkSide, and REvil.

Q: Are you using any OSINT tools or technologies throughout the attacks?
A: All available methods are being used.

Q: In your practice, did you encounter cases, when a group of companies
performed a sensitive deal, and during those activities, a company paid a
little “protection fee”, so that no one would intrude their systems and affect
the deal, for example at the moment when a merger decision was being
made?
A: This is a fantasy.

Q: Probably you have watched my episode with a famous lawyer from New
York, Arkady Bukh. In that episode, we spoke about the fact that sometimes
cybercriminals disclose their accomplices, for their own profit and a “green
card”. Do you know any public cases, when partners “sold” their
accomplices and handed over incriminating materials to special services?Q:

accomplices and handed over incriminating materials to special services?
A: We don’t know of such cases. If you are caught, don’t get sad, hand over everything
you’ve had.

Q: Some time ago, Cisco Talos published an interview with your
representative. What reactions and what results did you get from this
interview? Did it meet your expectations?
A: We have got new affiliates.

Q: What advice can you give to companies, so that they will not become
LockBit’s target?
A: Employ a full-time Red Team, regularly update all software, perform preventive talks with
a company’s employees to thwart social engineering, and most importantly – use the best
ransomware-fighting antivirus – BitDefender.

Q: If you could turn back time, would you be doing the same things you do
now?
A: Of course not. I sleep very badly at night. Money can’t buy happiness.

Q: A billion dollars - is it enough to “leave the stage”?
A: We love our job. The money is not the target – the process is the important thing. And of
course, fortunate is not the one who is rich, but the one who has a loyal wife [quote from a
popular Russian crime movie “The Brother” – KELA].

Q: How would you briefly describe your life’s path?

9/12

A: The one of self-realization. You should do the things that you can do the best because you
need to realize your potential – this is a basic necessity for every human.

Q: Were there cases when cybersecurity companies tried to deanonymize
you? If yes, please share the details of such attacks - what did you
remember the most?
A: There were. Usually, they try to make you click a link using social engineering, but
sometimes they send journalists to perform behavioral analysis and create a possible
criminal profile.

Q: In one of my interviews with Wojciech, a Polish offensive OSINT
specialist, he said “Ransomware, first and foremost, bets on easy money
and obvious access points such as RDP, unpatched VPN, and trivial
phishing - they all work in a relatively similar way. ICS hacking requires
specialized knowledge, understanding of protocols’ work. I highly doubt the
possibility of locking critical infrastructures in some city.” In your opinion, is
his claim true?
A: True, but only partially. Those who have specialized knowledge and tools unavailable for
many can mask their attacks, so that it would not be clear whose work it was – a professional
or an average hacker.

Q: The chastity belts’ locking story [an end of 2020 ransom demands aimed
at users of IoT chastity cages - KELA]. What sense do those attacks make,
when some lockers conduct them? Is this some PR stunt to make yourself
known?
A: It’s a ROFL [“rolling on the floor laughing” – KELA].

Q: Recently, Western media wrote that some ransomware groups recruit
negotiators to their lines - does it really require specialized people?
A: It depends on the pentester’s free time. A good pentester doesn’t have time for
negotiations.

Q: I heard an opinion from one cybersecurity specialist, that the lockers’
existence is profitable for certain large infosecurity companies. For example,
a victim company is required to pay ten million dollars, and then
immediately comes a large cybersecurity company and promises to decrypt
10/12

for seven million; but in reality, the cybersecurity company turns to the
lockers - without the victim’s knowledge - and negotiates to pay, say, five
million dollars from their own pocket. In the end, a large infosec giant makes
two million. Is there some truth to it?
A: It’s 100% true. Almost all recovery companies do this.

Q: When you became a dollar millionaire, how much did this feeling change
you as a person? What in your worldview has fundamentally changed?
A: It gave me confidence in the future, and also the ability to pay for a very expensive
surgery required for my brother. Attitude to security and anonymity has fundamentally
changed.

Q: Sophos Labs’ experts wrote earlier that LockBit, before encrypting the
victim, calls GetUserDefaultLangID which determines the default keyboard
setting. If there are Russian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Kazakh, Armenian, and other
languages then the target is not encrypted. Let’s suppose that many
companies adopt this practice, does it mean that companies would not be
encrypted anymore?
A: The system’s language is checked, and not the keyboard setting.

Q: Not once we hear opinions of certain info security experts, and even
underground members, that locking, ransomware, is, to say it nicely, a not
very smart endeavor skill-wise, meaning that this is some sort of
primitiveness that has little in common with the art of hacking. How would
you comment on this attitude towards ransomware?
A: This claim is invalid because few can write the fastest encryption algorithm in the world;
the software always requires support and innovation, so technical savviness is extremely
important.

Q: In your practice, have you seen - from the inside - cases when companies
deceive their clients, collect more of their information than needed, sell it,
manipulate clients, and siphon money, using the acquired data? Can you
talk about such cases?
A: Yes, we did. Usually, such companies pay the ransom significantly faster. I can’t tell the
details, because our reputation is important to us and in case of ransom payment we destroy
the company’s data, ensuring complete confidentiality of the deal.

11/12

Q: Not only in the CIS countries, but possibly in South America, the Middle
East, Europe, and Asia as well, companies invest too little in their
cybersecurity. Often, executives do not understand what risk management
is, are not ready to allocate budgets to train their infosec experts and
employees, nor spend money on protection of their infrastructure, pay
adequate salaries, etc. Here is where many problems begin. It’s no surprise
that, sometimes, skilled infosec experts switch to the “dark side”. If
organizations, afraid of the possibility of being attacked by ransomware, will
start investing money in their cybersecurity, the lockers’ job will become
harder due to stern competition between “blackhat” and “whitehat” experts,
which will surely make the global infosecurity market bigger. Do you,
generally, support this attitude, that companies need to give more attention
to their cybersecurity, invest more money in infosec?
A: I don’t support it. Let them fire everyone – I need the cybersecurity specialists more.

Q: What percentage of the corporate budget should, ideally, be spent on
cybersecurity, so a company could calmly deal with its commercial affairs?
A: It depends on the complexity of the corporate infrastructure and the amount of potential
entry points. I think that about 5-10% would be enough to make sure that the company will
never fall victim to ransomware.

Q: Final question - you have been cornered: would you fight to the death, or
retreat to save your life?
A: You should first make a commercial offer which is very difficult to refuse, and if it won’t
help – fight to the death. But as we know, money defeats evil.
