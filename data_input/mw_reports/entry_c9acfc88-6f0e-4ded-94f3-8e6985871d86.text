The Underminer exploit kit has surfaced numerous times since 2019, but here it is back
again delivering the Amadey malware, as the Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team found
last week.

Exploit Kit
An exploit kit (EK), or an exploit pack, is a type of toolkit cybercriminals use to attack
vulnerabilities in systems, for them to be able to distribute malware or perform other
malicious activities. Exploit kits are packaged with exploits that can target commonly installed
software, such as Adobe Flash®, Java®, Microsoft Silverlight®.
A typical exploit kit usually provides a management console, a bunch of vulnerabilities
targeted to different applications, and several add-on functions that make it easier for a
cybercriminal to launch an attack. Exploit kits typically integrate vulnerabilities of popular
applications, which many users leave poorly patched.
It can also be used by someone who does not have any experience writing software code for
creating, customizing, and distributing malware.

Underminer Exploit Kit
Underminer EK was first seen in the wild in 2017, targeting Asian countries by first deploying
bootkits. This is a malware loaded during the boot process, which controlled the operating
system start up, modifying the system before security components are loaded, for OS
persistency and then a coinminer at a later stage. Back then, this EK spread by malvertising
and exploiting browser vulnerabilities. One of the coinminers distributed by this EK was
“Hidden Bee” - a covertly running Chinese miner.
When we dig into the Underminer EK, the authors seem to have a good grasp of antidebugging techniques, as they applied plenty of them. We will discuss some interesting ones
below.
The first check this EK performs is the use of assembly rdtsc instruction – this instruction is
used to determine how many CPU ticks have taken place since the processor was reset.
This can also be used as an anti-debugging technique. The most common way is to use this
instruction to get the current timestamp, save it in a register, then get another timestamp and
check if the delta between the two is below the exact number of ticks that were pre-decided
by the author. In our sample, the second timestamp and the comparison were carried out
long after the first timestamp was saved in the memory:

Next, in case the Avast library is loaded into the running process, the EK detaches the
DLL_LOAD signal from aswhook.dll (Avast Hook Library) so that Avast AV will not capture

the later DLL loading event.

The Underminer remaps ntdll.dll and several others, a technique that might be used to
bypass User-Mode Hooks.
The kit also checks if one of the following security products are installed under C:\Program
Data by checking for the existence of the following products’ directories:
Avast Software
Avira
Kaspersky Lab
Panda Security
Doctor Web
AVG
360TotalSecurity
BitDefender
Norton
Sophos
Comodo

In addition, Underminer EK uses several more popular techniques to check whether the
process is being actively debugged. This EK didn’t perform any anti-vm or anti-emulation
techniques.

Later, the malware creates a “3e5d740863” folder under
C:\Users\Username\AppData\local\Temp (user’s temporary directory)and copies itself into it.
The malware will add a registry key
‘HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders’ and pass
the newly created folder path as a key value, which is a persistency technique in which the
folder’s content will be executed at user login, known as MITRE T1547.001.
After the file copy, the malware will execute the newly copied file and terminate the current
process.
To become even more persistent in the system, Underminer creates a scheduled task that
will execute malicious file every day at 01:00 AM. The scheduled task name is the
executable's name, and it is run with the user's credentials.
Our sample connects two command and control servers, and passes the information of the
infected station to them:

The information being passed is:
Victim ID
A version of the malware
PC name
Username
We assume, the number of binaries installed
The next stage is to download and execute additional malware. We checked the malware
twice and got two different executables; one of them was an Oski Stealer and another new,
well packed .Net stealer.
Oski Stealer is a malicious information stealer, which was first introduced in November 2019.
The Oski stealer steals personal and sensitive credentials from its target, eventually being
misused to clean out the user’s liquid assets.

The second stealer, (with the original name of ‘Licensing.exe’) seems to have some code
borrowed from RedLine Stealer. It steals browser credentials, crypto wallets, file share
credentials etc. It connects to the command-and-control server via the 16713 TCP port.
As a side note, info stealers might be co-opted into the cycle of various kinds of attacks, and
ransomware campaigns in particular. While serving a reliable method for criminals to obtain
credentials tied to financial accounts, they have also started using ‘information stealers’ to
obtain corporate remote network login credentials, like virtual private networks (VPNs) or
remote desktop software. corporate remote network login credentials, like virtual private
networks (VPNs) or remote desktop software.
Without being dependent on the drop file, Underminer exploit kit creates a new registry key
to gain persistence over the dropped malware. The key will be added under
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.
At the time this blog was published, the command-and-control server was still operating and
continues to distribute different types of malware.
Minerva Labs Hostile Environment Simulation and Critical Asset Protection modules prevent
the remap of DLLs required for Underminer exploit kit to carry out its attack, thus preventing
additional malware drops.
