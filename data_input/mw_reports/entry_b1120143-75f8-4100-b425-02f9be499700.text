About this talk
When Europol and the DoJ announced the arrest of the leaders of the Fin7 and Carbanak
cybercriminal group in 2018, it was believed the group would cease its activity. However,
data found in 2019 indicated that the attacks have not only continued but have evolved. Fin7
has extended the number of groups operating under its umbrella, sophisticated its methods
and even went on the legitimate job market to hire employees who apparently did not
suspect they were working for hackers. The main aim behind Fin7’s malicious activities
remained the same though – the stealing of financial assets. Сybersecurity experts from
Kaspersky Lab’s GReAT team – Yury Namestnikov and Felix Aime – will explain how the
new Fin7 activity was detected, which groups are now under its umbrella and how to protect
yourself from it.
