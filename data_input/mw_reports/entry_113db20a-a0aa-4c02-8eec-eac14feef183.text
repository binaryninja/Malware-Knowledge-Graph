Uber suffered a cyberattack Thursday afternoon with an allegedly 18-year-old hacker
downloading HackerOne vulnerability reports and sharing screenshots of the company's
internal systems, email dashboard, and Slack server.
The screenshots shared by the hacker and seen by BleepingComputer show what appears
to be full access to many critical Uber IT systems, including the company's security software
and Windows domain.
Other systems accessed by the hacker include the company's Amazon Web Services
console, VMware vSphere/ESXi virtual machines, and the Google Workspace admin
dashboard for managing the Uber email accounts.

The threat actor also breached the Uber Slack server, which he used to post messages to
employees stating that the company was hacked. However, screenshots from Uber's slack
indicate that these announcements were first met with memes and jokes as employees had
not realized an actual cyberattack was taking place.
Uber has since confirmed the attack, tweeting that they are in touch with law enforcement
and will post additional information as it becomes available.
"We are currently responding to a cybersecurity incident. We are in touch with law
enforcement and will post additional updates here as they become available," tweeted the
Uber Communications account.
The New York Times, which first reported on the breach, said they spoke to the threat actor,
who said they breached Uber after performing a social engineering attack on an employee
and stealing their password.
The threat actor then gained access to the company's internal systems using the stolen
credentials.
On Friday afternoon, Uber posted an additional update stating that the investigation is still
ongoing but could sharing these additional details:
We have no evidence that the incident involved access to sensitive user data
(like trip history).
All of our services including Uber, Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and the Uber Driver
app are operational.
As we shared yesterday, we have notified law enforcement.
Internal software tools that we took down as a precaution yesterday are coming
back online this morning.

More details emerge
After the attacker loudly announced that they breached Uber's systems on the company's
Slack server and in comments to submission on the HackerOne bug bounty program,
security researchers reached out to the threat actor to learn more about the attack.
In a conversation between the threat actor and security researcher Corben Leo, the hacker
said they were able to gain access to Uber's Intranet after conducting a social engineering
attack on an employee.
According to the threat actor, they attempted to log in as an Uber employee but did not
provide details on how they gained access to the credentials.

As the Uber account was protected with multi-factor authentication, the attacker allegedly
used an MFA Fatigue attack and pretended to be Uber IT support to convince the employee
to accept the MFA request.

MFA Fatigue attacks are when a threat actor has access to corporate login credentials but
is blocked from access to the account by multi-factor authentication. They then issue
repeated MFA requests to the target until the victims become tired of seeing them and
finally accept the notification.
This social engineering tactic has become very popular in recent attacks against well-known
companies, including Twitter, MailChimp, Robinhood, and Okta.
After gaining access to the credentials, the threat actor told Leo that they logged into the
Internal network through the corporate VPN and began scanning the company's Intranet for
sensitive information.
As part of these scans, the hacker says they found a PowerShell script containing admin
credentials for the company's Thycotic privileged access management (PAM) platform,
which was used to access the login secrets for the company's other internal services.
"ok so basically uber had a network share \\[redacted]pts. the share contained some
powershell scripts.
one of the powershell scripts contained the username and password for a admin user
in Thycotic (PAM) Using this i was able to extract secrets for all services, DA, DUO,
Onelogin, AWS, Gsuite"
The New York Times reports that the attacker claimed to have accessed Uber databases
and source code as part of the attack.
To be clear, this information is from the threat actors and has not been verified by Uber,
which has not responded to our requests for more information.

HackerOne vulnerability reports exposed
While it's possible that the threat actor stole data and source code from Uber during this
attack, they also had access to what could be an even more valuable asset.
According to Yuga Labs security engineer Sam Curry, the hacker also had access to the
company's HackerOne bug bounty program, where they commented on all of the
company's bug bounty tickets.

Curry told BleepingComputer that he first learned of the breach after the attacker left the
above comment on a vulnerability report he submitted to Uber two years ago.
Uber runs a HackerOne bug bounty program that allows security researchers to privately
disclose vulnerabilities in their systems and apps in exchange for a monetary bug bounty
reward. These vulnerability reports are meant to be kept confidential until a fix can be
released to prevent attackers from exploiting them in attacks.
Curry further shared that an Uber employee said the threat actor had access to all of the
company's private vulnerability submissions on HackerOne.
BleepingComputer was also told by a source that the attacker downloaded all vulnerability
reports before they lost access to Uber's bug bounty program. This likely includes
vulnerability reports that have not been fixed, presenting a severe security risk to Uber.
HackerOne has since disabled the Uber bug bounty program, cutting off access to the
disclosed vulnerabilities.
However, it would not be surprising if the threat actor had already downloaded the
vulnerability reports and would likely sell them to other threat actors to cash out on the
attack quickly.
Update 9/16/22:
Added more details provided by the hacker about how the attack took place.
Added statement from Uber.
