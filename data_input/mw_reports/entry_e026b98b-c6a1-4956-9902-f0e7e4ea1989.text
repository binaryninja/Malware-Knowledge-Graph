CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Earlier this year, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group published research titled “Iranian
Threat Actor Amasses Large Infrastructure Network to Target Saudi Organizations,”
which analyzed the network infrastructure of suspected Iranian state-sponsored CNO
threat actors. We continued to monitor the activity until late July 2019 using proprietary
techniques including Recorded Future network traffic analysis and Recorded Future
domain analysis.
Data sources included the Recorded Future® Platform, Farsight Security’s DNSDB,
ReversingLabs, VirusTotal, Shodan, and common OSINT tools.
The target audience for this research includes security practitioners and threat
intelligence professionals who exhibit an interest in Russian and Iranian nation-state
computer network operational activity.

Executive Summary
Over the course of 2019, there were several documented instances
of Russian threat actor groups hijacking Iranian group infrastructure,
most recently with the U.K. National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)
and U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) jointly releasing an
advisory outlining how the Russian-attributed threat group Turla
had co-opted two Iranian malware families, likely without Iranian
knowledge.
In our analysis, we uncovered evidence of an overlap in operational
infrastructure between a threat actor Insikt Group tracks as
BlueAlpha and suspected Iranian nation-state activity. There is a
strong overlap between BlueAlpha and Gamaredon Group malware
and infrastructure TTPs; therefore, we assess with moderate
confidence that BlueAlpha is a Russian state-sponsored threat
actor. Notably, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has attributed
the Gamaredon Group to the FSB 16th and 18th divisions.
Further, we found more overlaps between infrastructure associated
with several well-documented Iranian threat actor groups, including
APT33 (Elfin), APT35 (Charming Kitten), and MUDDYWATER. Both
APT33 and APT35 are believed to be operating in line with strategic
priorities set by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC); the
organizational attribution for MUDDYWATER is less clear at this
stage. For ease of comprehension, we will refer to the clustering of
APT33, APT35, and MUDDYWATER infrastructure as the “Iran-nexus”
in this report. Please note that we do not assess, at this stage, that
these groups are a single homogenous Iranian threat actor, but
rather that they all have notable overlapping TTPs.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Key Judgments
We continue to discover infrastructure overlaps among several
Iranian threat actor groups. When coupled with our prior
research on the tiered approach to the Iranian cyber operational
administration, we assess that distinctions between these threat
actor groups continue to blur, which leads us to consider the
following hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive:
• Some form of organizational overlap is placed over the
management of operational resources between Iranian
groups.
• The overlaps indicate that the groups are closely aligned,
share resources, and are possibly all working for the same
organization, which we assess is likely to be the IRGC for the
APT33, APT35, and MUDDYWATER nexus.
• The infrastructure overlaps point to a potential
misclassification of Iranian threat actor groups, or suggest
that the groups have evolved such that previous classifications
may be inadequate.
In two separate instances, we identified unique domain
characteristics that linked a domain spoofing the Saudi International
Petrochemical Company and used by the Iran-nexus threat actor
group to the operational infrastructure of the suspected-Russian
state-sponsored threat actor BlueAlpha. We have high confidence
in the association of these domains and the operational activity
associated with them to BlueAlpha in 2019, which points to the
following potential hypotheses:
• BlueAlpha mimicked the TTPs of the Iran-nexus groups.
We assess that this is a likely scenario given the two (1, 2)
very notable recent examples of FSB-affiliated threat actors
hijacking Iranian APT infrastructure.
• BlueAlpha commandeered old Iran-nexus group
infrastructure. Insikt Group assesses that this is also a likely
scenario, given that other FSB-affiliated threat actors such as
Turla have demonstrated an effective ability to use false flags.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

• Iran-nexus group mimicked Gamaredon Group TTPs. Insikt
Group assesses this to be an unlikely scenario, because it
would require a very high degree of technical and operational
preparedness and would be a high-risk maneuver by the Irannexus group in order to target Ukrainian interests.
• An operational collaboration exists between the Irannexus group and BlueAlpha. While collaboration on training
and sharing of techniques is plausible, actual operational
infrastructure sharing would require non-trivial deconfliction
efforts to ensure targeted operations were effective. We
assess this to be an unlikely scenario.

Outlook
On October 21, the U.K. National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) and
U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) jointly released an advisory
outlining how the Russian-attributed threat group Turla had coopted two Iranian tools, likely without Iranian knowledge. NCSC and
NSA were able to make the distinction between the Iranian activity
using these tools and the Turla activity on the basis of three factors:
1. Administration of infrastructure from either Turla or Iranianassociated IP addresses
2. Turla group scanned for Iranian-associated backdoors
3. Turla compromised Iranian infrastructure by deploying their
own implants
Turla has been attributed by Estonian intelligence services and the
Czech government to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).
The Security Services of Ukraine as well as threat intelligence
researchers have also attributed Gamaredon Group to the FSB.
In our research, we observed significant overlapping operational
infrastructure between Iranian groups APT33, APT35, and
MUDDYWATER. We assess with moderate confidence that all three
groups are likely tied to the IRGC and the continued blurring of TTPs
between the three groups is likely to continue to inhibit clustering
of IRGC-originated threat activity.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

We also uncovered significant overlaps between the operational
infrastructure for the Iran-nexus group and the Gamaredon Group.
The number of overlapping domains indicate our observations are
a key departure from previously reported Gamaredon activity.
This departure was the apparent Middle Eastern targeting, as
Gamaredon have typically targeted Ukrainian interests in the
past. For that reason, we opted for the BlueAlpha designator for
the suspected Russia state-sponsored threat actor. We assess
BlueAlpha and Gamaredon Group are closely aligned groups with
similar TTPs and are both likely tied to Russia’s FSB. Insikt Group
assesses that Russian state-sponsored groups will continue to
conduct cyber operations that use techniques such as false flags
or leverage vulnerable operational infrastructure of other threat
actors in order to obfuscate activity and hinder attribution efforts.
