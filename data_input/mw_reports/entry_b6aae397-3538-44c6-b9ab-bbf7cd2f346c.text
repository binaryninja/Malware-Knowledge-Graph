Our team recently came across a malicious script used on a Magento website titled
gstaticapi, which targeted checkout processes to capture and exfiltrate stolen information.
To obtain sensitive details, the malware loads external javascript whenever the URL contains
“checkout” — this location typically belongs to the step in Magento’s checkout process where
users enter their sensitive credit card information and shipping details.

As seen above, the first if statement looks for the checkout string in the URL using
window.location.href.indexOf.
When decoded, the base64 string “Y2hlY2tvdXQ=” equates to “checkout”:

The code creates a script element, where script.src= has been set to another base64 string
equal to gstaticapi[.]com/gs.js.
The JavaScript is added to the header of the web page’s document where the external code
can be loaded, handling all the heavy lifting to steal and exfiltrate the credit card information
and billing details.
While the script consists of only five lines, it can be combined into a single line to make it
more difficult to detect. And unless you know exactly which strings to look for, a search for
any associated domains will be difficult since they are all encoded.
To detect these types of injections, your best bet is to leverage a website monitoring service
that can detect changes on both externally and at the server level.
