After four years of activity and numerous takedown attempts, the death knell of TrickBot has
sounded as its top members move under new management, the Conti ransomware
syndicate, who plan to replace it with the stealthier BazarBackdoor malware.
TrickBot is a Windows malware platform that uses multiple modules for various malicious
activities, including information stealing, password stealing, infiltrating Windows domains,
initial access to networks, and malware delivery.

TrickBot has dominated the malware threat landscape since 2016, partnering with
ransomware gangs and causing havoc on millions of devices worldwide.

The Ryuk ransomware gang initially partnered with TrickBot for initial access to works, but
were replaced Conti Ransomware gang who has been using the malware for the past year to
gain access to corporate networks.
It is estimated that the group handling TrickBot campaigns - an elite division known by the
name Overdose, has made at least $200 million from its operations,

Conti takes over TrickBot operation
Researchers at cybercrime and adversarial disruption company Advanced Intelligence
(AdvIntel) noticed that in 2021 Conti had become the only beneficiary of TrickBot’s supply of
high-quality network accesses.
By this time, TrickBot’s core team of developers had already created a stealthier piece of
malware, BazarBackdoor, used primarily for remote access into valuable corporate networks
where ransomware could be deployed.

As the TrickBot trojan had become easily detectable by antivirus vendors, the threat actors
began switching to BazarBackdoor for initial access to networks as it was developed
specifically to stealthily compromise high-value targets.
However, by the end of 2021, Conti managed to attract “multiple elite developers and
managers” of the TrickBot botnet, turning the operation into its subsidiary rather than a
partner, AdvIntel notes in a report shared with BleepingComputer.
Based on internal Conti conversations that the researchers had access to and shared with
BleepingComputer, AdvIntel says that BazarBackdoor moved from being part of TrickBot’s
toolkit to a standalone tool whose development is controlled by the Conti ransomware
syndicate.
The main admin for the Conti group said that they took over TrickBot. However, as the "bot is
dead" they are moving Conti from TrickBot to BazarBackdoor as the primary way of gaining
initial access.
“After being “acquired” by Conti, [TrickBot leaders] are now rich in prospects with secure
ground beneath them, and Conti will always find a way to make use of the available talent” AdvIntel
Ever since its launch, the Conti operation maintained a code of conduct that allowed it to rise
as one of the most resilient and lucrative ransomware groups, unfazed by law enforcement
crackdowns on its competitors.
AdvIntel says that the group was able to run their normal cybercriminal business by adopting
a “trust-based, team-based” model instead of working with random affiliates that would cause
action from law enforcement due to the organizations they hit.
While TrickBot malware detections will become less common, AdvIntel's recent findings
show that the operation is not finished and it just moved to a new control group that takes it
to the next level with malware better suited for high-value targets.
