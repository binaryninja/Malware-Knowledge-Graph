Sophisticated loader delivers Cobalt-Strike Beacons
In March 2022, a new malware named “Bumblebee” was discovered and reportedly distributed via spam
campaigns. Researchers identified that Bumblebee is a replacement for BazarLoader malware, which has
delivered Conti Ransomware in the past. Bumblebee acts as a downloader and delivers known attack
frameworks and open-source tools such as Cobalt Strike, Shellcode, Sliver, Meterpreter, etc. It also
downloads other types of malware such as ransomware, trojans, etc.
Our intelligence indicates that the incidents of Bumblebee infection are on the rise, as shown below.

Rise of Bumblebee Malware

The Bumblebee infection starts through spam email. This email contains a link to further download an ISO
file that eventually drops the malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file. The DLL file further loads
Bumblebee’s final payload on the victim’s machine.
ISO files are a type of archive file that contain an identical copy of data found on an optical disc, CDs,
DVDs, etc. They are primarily used to back up optical discs or distribute large file sets intended to burn
onto an optical disc.

Technical Details:
The complete technical analysis of Bumblebee is mentioned in the following sections. Cyble Research
Labs analysed the hash (SHA256),
“3e698d8d6e7820cc337d5e2eb3d8fbae752a4c05d11bcf00d3cb7d6dc45e1884” for analysis.

Bumblebee Initial Access:
Bumblebee has been distributed through spear-phishing email messages that use different methods to
trick users into downloading and opening the ISO files.
The spam email contains an HTML attachment as well as a hyperlink in the mail body to download the
ISO file. Similarly, the HTML attachment contains a link that downloads the ISO file from Microsoft
OneDrive.
Figure 2 shows the spam email that downloads ISO files from Microsoft OneDrive when users click on the
“REVIEW THE DOCUMENT” hyperlink.

Spam Email (Source – Proofpoint)
The ISO file contains two files called Attachments.lnk and Attachments.dat. This malicious link file
contains the parameters to execute “Attachments.dat,” which is the Bumblebee payload, using Windows’
rundll32.exe service.
Figure 3 shows the contents of the ISO file and properties of the .lnk file.

“C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe” Attachments.dat,ProcessLoad
In another case of infection, the ISO file contains three files, namely New Folder.LNK, 7z.exe, and
arch.7z. The shortcut file New Folder.LNK launches powershell.exe and extracts the password-protected
file arch.7z by using 7z.exe.
The arch.7z file contains a 64-bit DLL file named “arch.dll,” which is a Bumblebee loader. The PowerShell
command extracts the arch.dll file into the location C:\ProgramData\ and executes it using rundll32.exe.
Figure 4 shows the contents of the ISO file and properties of the .lnk file.

Defensive Evasion:
Bumblebee downloads and executes the other payloads on victim machines without being detected by
any antivirus programs. Bumblebee uses various techniques to inject and attach the payloads into the
running process.
The Bumblebee loader has a list of process names related to tools used by security researchers to identify
if the malware is debugged or running in a virtual environment. The malware terminates its execution if it
identifies any of these processes running on the victim’s machine. The figure below shows the list of
process names.

Figure 5 – List of the Security Tools

The malware terminates its execution if it is identified to be running in a sandbox environment. The
malware calls the Wine_get_unix_file_name() API to identify the sandbox machine, as shown below.

Figure 6 – Sandbox

Detection using GetProcAddress()
Bumblebee also avoids running in the sandbox environment by comparing the victim’s specific usernames
with a list of hard-coded usernames. The hard-coded names are commonly-used sandbox usernames
seen in the wild.
If user account names match with the names on the list, the malware terminates itself. A list of user
account names is shown in the figure below.

The malware performs additional checks to identify the virtual environment, such as Wine, Vbox, and
VMware. To identify the virtual environment, the malware performs the following actions:
Queries registry keys related to Virtual Machine-related software
Executes WMI queries to identify them
Identifies emulator by reading the respective registry keys
Identify the window name of the running process
This technique used by malware is highlighted in the figure below.

Figure 8 –

Additional Defence Evasion Techniques
After the evading detection, Bumblebee resolves its function names at runtime and creates a unique event
name, 3C29FEA2-6FE8-4BF9-B98A-0E3442115F67.

Figure 9 –
Bumblebee Creating Unique Event
The malware uses WMI queries to collect details such as system details, adapter details, etc., from the
victim’s machine. After that, it sends the stolen information to the Command and Control (C&C) server.

The Bumblebee Loader uses various commands to perform malicious activities such as DLL injection,
downloading executables, uninstalling loaders, and enabling persistence. The commands used by the
malware are mentioned below.
“dij”
“dex”
“sdl”
“ins”

DLL Injection:
The malware receives the “dij” command for DLL and Shellcode injection. As shown in Figure 11, it injects
Shellcode into legitimate processes using the APC routine. It specifically injects code into the below
processes:
\\Windows Photo Viewer\\ImagingDevices.exe
\\Windows Mail\\wab.exe
\\Windows Mail\\wabmig.exe

Figure 11

– Process injection via Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC)
The loader then creates two new sections within the target process and copies the Shellcode to the newly
created sections to properly inject the Shellcode. Then it invokes the Shellcode in the target executable
via a dynamically resolved NtQueueApcThread().

Downloading Additional Payloads:
The malware receives the “dex” command for downloading and executing additional payloads. After
receiving this command along with payload data, it writes the file into a disk using the CreateFileA() and
WriteFile() functions and executes it via the COM object.
In this example, the malware uses the hardcoded name “wab.exe” to store the payload.

operation

Persistence:

8/11

The Ins command helps enable persistence by copying the Bumblebee malwareDLL into the %appdata%
directory and creating a VBS script that loads the malicious DLL using a scheduled task.
The sdl command uses PowerShell to delete files from the infected system without prompting the user.
The PowerShell command used by the malware is:
PS C:\> Remove-item -Path “filepath” -Force

C&C Communication:
The figure below shows the COBALT STRIKE traffic from the malware.

Conclusion
Bumblebee is a new and highly sophisticated malware loader that employs extensive evasive maneuvers
and anti-analysis tricks, including complex anti-virtualization techniques. To make the Bumblebee
malware’s activity stealthier and harder to detect, its Threat Actors frequently update these capabilities.
Bumblebee loader can be deployed to facilitate initial access and deliver payloads such as Cobalt Strike,
ransomware, etc. It is likely to become a popular tool for ransomware groups to deliver their payload.
Cyble Research Labs closely monitors the BumbleBee malware group and other similar Threat Actor
activities and analyzes them to better understand their motivations and keep our readers well-informed.

Our Recommendations
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their authenticity.
Educate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted URLs.
Avoid downloading files from unknown websites.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected
devices.
Use a reputed antivirus and internet security software package on your connected devices, including
PC, laptop, and mobile.
Block URLs that could spread the malware, e.g., Torrent/Warez.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.
Enable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solutions on the employees’ systems.
