Recently, 360 Security Center has detected a variety of hacking Trojans through the fileless
attack protection function，and Trojans spread through the new Trojan distribution
framework. According to the framework’s peculiar naming method, we named it SolarSys.
SolarSys is mainly active in Brazil (South America), and Brazil has always been one of the
regions where banking Trojans are extremely active. The SolarSys framework is mainly
composed of JavaScript backdoors, mail worms and multiple spy modules. The overall
structure is as follows:

The framework uses dozens of dynamic domain names as C&C server addresses and uses
the word-combination of DGA algorithm to generate domain names randomly. When security
vendors block some of the domain names, hackers will quickly activate new domain names
to ensure that the overall botnet will not be affect. The domain name that generates logic is
as follows:

Backdoor components
At first, we intercepted a large number of fake MSI installers, many of them were Java,
Microsoft Html help and other programs. After the program runs, it will call InstallUtil
(T1218.004) to execute the malicious .Net dynamic library uninstall.dll:

uninstall.dll uses the interface provided by the Microsoft.Jscript module to execute the
JavaScript backdoor in memory, register itself as a self-starting, and run Install.js according
to the configuration file issued by the cloud:

Install.js downloads and executes the latest virus module execution every 11 hours:

Downloaded components are used in Delphi, and both use the same core code obfuscator to
obfuscate, confuse code as follows:

The algorithm for decrypting core PE files is as follows:

Then get the backdoor instruction and execute it after parsing, the instruction content is as
follows:

Mail worm
SolarSys will deploy a set of nodejs environment on user computers and run malicious
JavaScript scripts. By simulating a click, send a phishing email to the current user’s friend:

The content of the phishing email sent by the remote server configuration:

The attachment of the phishing email is as follows:

The attachment uses template injection technology to download other malicious payloads:

Unfortunately, we did not obtain the documents corresponding to the template during the
analysis process. It is estimated that the Trojan will be updated and distributed through this
channel in the future：

Spy components
The final released payload of chstea01.rar is the stealing module for Google Chrome
browser. The stolen data includes the account password for logging in to the website,
browsing history, etc. The code logic is as follows:

The final payload corresponding to BOM.bin is a banking Trojan. By detecting the webpage
the user browses, the fake online banking login interface shown in the figure below pops up,
tricking the user into entering various credentials for login, and submitting these credentials
to the hacker. Fraudulent banks include Banco do Nordeste, Banco Mercantil, CrediSIS,
Banrisul, Safra, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, Banco Itaú, Santander, Sicoob, banco inter,
Banestes, Banpará and other banks in Brazil.

SolarSys is a new Spy Trojan distribution framework. As of press time, only 360 company on
VirusTotal can detect and kill the Trojan:

Therefore, we recommend that the majority of users install the 360 Total Security to defend
and kill the SolarSys in time:
