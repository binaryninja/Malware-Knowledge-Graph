July 12, 2021 | By Melissa Frydrych co-authored by Claire Zaboeva, Dan Dash
In a recent collaboration to investigate a rise in malware infections featuring a commercial
Remote Access Trojan (RAT), IBM Security X-Force and Cipher Tech Solutions (CT), a
defense and intelligence security firm, investigated malicious activity that spiked in Q1-2021.
With over 1,300 malware samples collected, our teams analyzed the delivery of a new
variant of the RoboSki packer, a packer being widely used to thwart detection and ultimately
deliver commodity RATs to enterprise networks.
Cipher Tech automated the capability to rapidly extract configuration data from malware to
produce actionable IOCs. Analysts tested the ability to statically extract configuration data,
bypassing dynamic anti-analysis features using data processed by CT1, discovering
approximately 1,300 additional samples. The RoboSki-packed malware samples discovered
feature new capabilities, such as the ability to load resources and convert pixelated data to
RGB order, resulting in the RoboSki component, and decoding and decrypting a ReZer0
loader. The ReZer0 loader can embed malware or fetch it from remote servers and is known
for its ability to deliver encrypted payloads and anti-sandbox checks. Layering loaders is a
tactic many malware distributors use to evade anti-virus detection and security scanners.
CT partnered with IBM X-Force to uncover how attackers delivered the commercial
RATs while analyzing the delivery of RoboSki samples, X-Force isolated a sample of 21
phishing emails addressed to organizations worldwide in, and around mid-February 2021
with attachments including RoboSki packed malware. The emails, which feature global trade
themes, lead to the delivery of numerous malwares, such as Agent Tesla, FormBook, njRAT,
NetWire, and the Remcos RAT.
X-Force found infrastructure overlaps with the delivery of RoboSki’s distribution with recent,
or ongoing activity spreading malware such as AsyncRAT, LokiBot, NanoCore, and the
Gamarue Botnet, in addition to Agent Tesla, FormBook, njRAT, NanoCore, and Remcos RAT
which have previously been reported on IBM’s premium threat intelligence platform TruSTAR
and Security Intelligence.
Prior references to the RoboSki malware have been made in mid-2020, linking it to activity
by a group known as “Vendetta”. X-Force and CT do not necessarily attribute the new
RoboSki variant we analyzed, or its means of delivery, exclusively to Vendetta. We believe
that the activity we examined points to independent cybercriminals distributing malware
globally, and a part of the continuous effort to evolve tools and methods, better obfuscate
activity, and evade detection.

Automated Component and Configuration Extraction(ACCE)

Are Cybercriminals Riding the Tide of Global Recovery?
2020 saw the global economy experience the worst peacetime economic decline since the
Great Depression, but in its economic growth forecast for 2021, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) predicts renewed global economic expansion of 6% in 2021 alone. Arguably
underpinning this recovery in global trade is a worldwide expansion in the eCommerce
ecosystem, which grew by a staggering 30% within the last year. Doubtlessly attune to these
changes in the digital current, malicious cyber actors are baiting their hooks accordingly to
imitate authentic requests for quotations, payment orders, and shipping updates, hoping to
snare those logistical linchpins, like manufacturers, shippers, and suppliers, in the global
supply chain.
X-Force analysts studied a sample of 21 phishing emails containing malicious attachments
that deliver the RoboSki packer, and subsequently a variety of final payloads. Analyzed
emails were sent approximately between the second and third week of February 2021 and
were categorized into three main themes: Purchase Order/RFQ/Inquiry, Shipping
Notification, and Payment Notice/ Bank Transfers. The sample emails were sent to 15 unique
companies located in 12 different countries across Europe, South America, the Middle East,
and South Asia.
In all instances, the phishing emails were addressed to companies associated with the
manufacture or export of items supporting and/or supplying construction, transport,
engineering, or energy services. Most samples were directed at entities in Europe, with the
highest concentration of targeted organizations based in Romania, Italy, and Germany.
X-Force and CT analysts assess with high confidence that global trade and logistics themed
phishing campaigns will continue to plague organizations into the year ahead, as the
recovery of global trade unfolds over time. Organizations, especially those engaged in
import and export, should exercise extra caution, and seek to cultivate a culture of cyber
awareness among management and all employees.

New Orders and Requests for Quotations
Most emails in our sample were sent to a Romania-based company characterized as a
global supplier of electrotechnical power products, including power transformers and rotary
electric machines. Several of the emails were crafted to appear to originate from real
company email domains, indicating the senders are trying to increase the likelihood that the
phishing email appears legitimate. Apart from a single instance, the emails pose as an
inquiry surrounding purchase orders and requests for quotations. All emails are written in
poor English and include an attached purchase order or quotation contained in an archive file
(Zip, CAB, or RAR), which when executed, drops the RoboSki packed malware.

Figure 1: Sample email sent to a Romania based company
Additional phishing messages uncovered with the same theme were primarily composed in
varying qualities of English and directed at seven unique entities across Europe and South
America, targeting companies that manufacture automobile parts, machinery, and energy
components. While the quality of the text differs by sample, the uncovered emails contain
signature blocks attempting to impersonate well known global corporations.

Where’s My Package?
We found the email sender janattbs7[@]gmail[.]com sent not only one email to the
Romanian-based company regarding a “quotation request”, but also an email for “shipping
documents”. Due to additional emails sent to the same company with varying themes, XForce researched the spoofed sender company as well as the recipient company; however,
no clear connection between the two was discerned.
Some of the sample emails used package delivery lures that purported to come from DHL or
FedEx. These were typically sent to companies within the construction industry that support
oil companies and government clients, as well as water technology and processing.

“Dear Customer,
Your package has arrived at the office. Our courier could not deliver it to your address due to
a wrong address provided by our customer.
To receive your package, please go to any of our nearest office and show this receipt.
CLICK ON THE ATTACHED FILE TO DOWNLOAD AND PRINT THE RECEIPT.
Greetings
The DHL team”

Fake Notices, Payments, and Invoices
Other emails in the sample featured fake payment notices, invoices, or bank transfers and
were sent to organizations in Europe and the Middle East. Half of the samples were
composed in the native language of the targeted recipients and contained signature blocks of
authentic banks or import/export companies. The remaining emails were composed in wellworded English, and featured signature blocks impersonating the Managing Director of a
legitimate global shipping and logistics/supply chain management company based in
Bangladesh.
While the sender email addresses did not match the signature blocks featured in each of the
samples, in all cases the signature blocks themselves imitate authentic companies that may
have a legitimate interest in the products or services of the targeted corporation.
In two instances, emails used the encrypted email service Tutanota (ex.
imports[@]tutanota[.]com[.]de.). Affixed to each of these emails was an attached archive file
(TAR, 7z, GZIP) posing as either Transfer Requests, SWIFT statements from an authentic
bank, or numeric codes potentially pointing to account numbers.

Observations from Our Analysis
X-Force uncovered several unique characteristics which provide insight into the attack
infrastructure used in the various delivery of RoboSki packed malware to facilitate
operations. The activity we examined involved at least 289 email addresses for exfiltration of
which, about 150 do not appear legitimate nor have discoverable returns, while more than
half appear to be valid accounts.
About 20 percent of the valid email accounts showed server errors, and roughly 10 percent
of accounts were associated with catch-all servers that accept emails sent to the domain,
regardless of whether the mailbox exists or not. The remaining accounts returned as either
belonging to invalid domains with no mail exchange record, bad syntax, transient network
faults, or unknown status.
Infrastructure Overlaps with Distribution of Other Malware
We isolated about 165 different C2 IP addresses and domains that were used in the
distribution of malicious payloads. Several IP addresses and domains have been reported in
previous malware campaigns or are associated with recent or ongoing activity delivering a
variety of other malware. Some malware variants include Eldorado, Telegram Bot, NanoBot,
LokiBot, and the password stealers Fareit and Redline. The following represents a sample of
the recent, or ongoing, campaigns that share, or have shared infrastructure overlaps with the
RoboSki packer:
AsyncRAT

Some malicious overlaps include domain 8123wsheurope.access[.]ly which resolved to the
RoboSki packed AsyncRAT C2 IP address 79.134.225[.]44 in December 2020. Recently, this
domain was reported as being part of activity in which attackers used collaboration platforms

5/16

such as Slack, to evade detection and deliver several types of RATs and stealers. AsyncRAT
has also been active in the past month in attacks on the aviation, travel, and cargo industry.
NanoCore RAT

In the same netblock as the AsyncRAT IP address, a RoboSki-packed NanoCore C2 IP
address 79.134.225[.]71 resolved to adam9.ddns[.]net, which was a C2 domain reported in
late-2020 with relation to activities by the Blade Eagle (Blade Hawk) APT group. In that
campaign, Blade Eagle targeted organizations in the Middle East and West Asia. We also
found that C2 domains uyeco[.]pw and zolta[.]icu were seen in a recent malspam campaign
in which malicious executable file formats were abused, and used, in a way that hid them
from email scanners and anti-malware software, ultimately to deliver the NanoCore RAT. The
infection TTPs were similar to the ones used to deliver the RoboSki packed malware, via
emails themed with purchase orders in archived files.
LokiBot

Other observed overlaps include RoboSki-packed LokiBot C2 domains:
– alphastand[.]trade – alphashtand[.]top – alphastand[.]win – kbfvzoboss[.]bid
These were previously observed in a campaign using Microsoft Publisher files to deliver the
Pony malware. The domains were also reported as a separate phishing campaign in 2019
using “SWIFT monetary transfer” themed lures to deliver LokiBot, in addition to Neshta, and
Fuerboos. All four C2 domains were used again in October 2020, as part of a different
Lokibot spam campaign. Of note, these C2 domains were present in 95 of the RoboSki
packed LokiBot samples, accounting for 41 unique LokiBot payloads.
Gamarue Botnet

In addition, the C2 domains azmtool[.]us, becharnise[.]ir, newcesarnex[.]com, and
klimsourcinq[.]com, were reported in February as being related to the Gamarue Botnet. In
these instances, each of the domains were present in varying RoboSki packed LokiBot
samples.
File Path Observations
Some file paths have noticeable misspellings such as %AppData%\microsift.exe, which was
observed in a RoboSki packed AsyncRAT sample. We found that additional file paths, such
as %Temp%\windefendllinici.exe in RoboSki packed AsyncRAT samples, may be associated
with files compiled in February 2021, that matched YARA signatures for Nanocore, and
password stealers, several of which communicate with the RoboSki packed AsyncRAT C2
domain laboratoriogenfarp.linkpc[.]net.
It is possible the appearance of the same file path in a limited sample set may suggest that
the same malicious actor has been involved in several campaigns delivering various
malwares. File path %AppData%\notes\logs.dat, seen in a RoboSki packed Remcos sample,

6/16

was also observed within other files that matched YARA rules for Remcos RAT and Agent
Tesla. The presence of %AppData%\seguridad\logs.dat in a RoboSki packed Remcos
sample may suggest that a Spanish-speaking company may have had their security logs
accessed. In addition, this file path was found within a file possibly related to Razy malware.
License Re-Use
While analyzing some of the final payloads, some interesting and specific attributes
regarding Remcos RAT were observed. Our analysts found that the Remcos configuration
contains a license code field (“license_code”), which is unique to each purchaser. In some
cases where the RoboSki packer led to the delivery of Remcos, it was observed that two
specific license codes were re-used.
The license codes we observed within the configuration of multiple payloads for packaging
were:
1. License code A830299B3222E31F1F2765E3AC4D37FD – observed four times and
associated with C2 addresses 184.140.53.148:1011, and 79.134.225.14:1011.
2. License code 8896DBA4C4FC821D8BAAC764BC9822E3 appeared in eight instances,
associated with C2 addresses 91.241.19.107:1313, and 176.111.174.14:2804.
In addition, the configuration of Remcos RAT contains the field “server_password”, with both
of these license codes using the password “Yes”- although it is possibly defined as the
default password.

New RoboSki Version – The Technical Details
As identified by X-Force, the RoboSki packer file typically arrives within a malicious email
archive attachment. CT further analyzed the packer and its embedded components to
understand the execution flow leading to a commodity RAT payload and how that execution
flow differed from previous RoboSki packers.

7/16

Figure 4: Mapping of RoboSki Packer to Final Payload
RoboSki.Packer
CT analysts found that the RoboSki packer contains numerous .NET Microsoft resources,
including the two resources of interest, SzGeneric and EventWaitHandleRights (highlighted
in figure 5), which are stored as PNG images.

8/16

Figure 5: Key Resources
The resource SzGeneric contains the RoboSki component. The Roboski component is used
to decrypt the contents of the resource EventWaitHandleRights, resulting in a ReZer0 loader.
To get to the ReZer0 loader, the RoboSki packer first loads the SzGeneric resource and
converts the pixel data to RGB order, as denoted in the image below, resulting in the
RoboSki component.

9/16

Figure 6: Conversion to RGB Order
This differs from previous RoboSki packer versions wherein the component was stored as
string data and decoded using string replacement and the Base32 algorithm or string
replacement, string reversal, and the Base64 algorithm.
The converted data is then executed and invoked in a series of module calls, depicted in the
image below, in which the component is executed from its O5.Ga namespace/class and
passed parameters from the class named ChannelSinkStack.

Figure 7: Converted Data Executed and Invoked
The parameters stored within ChannelSinkStack are the hex-encoded values for the
resource named EventWaitHandleRights, and a base XOR key “xNksm”.

10/16

Figure 8: ChannelSinkStack Parameters
RoboSki.Component
As described above, during execution the RoboSki component is provided resource and
XOR key parameters, and proceeds to decode and decrypt the ReZer0 loader from the
RoboSki packer. The component loads the resource and arranges the pixels in BGRA order.
The component then parses the resource according to the structure below, and XOR
decrypts the data using the results of permutations against the base XOR key and a control
key.

Figure 9: Python Construct Library Structure

Figure 10: Structure Parsing and XOR Decryption
The resultant ReZer0 loader is then executed in memory and subsequently decrypts and
executes an embedded payload, which in this case, is an instance of the Agent Tesla RAT.
The ReZer0 loader operates in the same manner as described by 360 Total Security and
Fortinet. As mentioned in those blog posts, the ReZer0 loader exhibits anti-analysis features
such as detection of Virtual Machines or Sandboxes and can bypass Anti-Virus software.
Due to these anti-analysis features, the results from dynamic analysis, including sandboxes,
may be incomplete or wildly inaccurate. By using Automated Component and Configuration
Extraction (ACCE) to statically extract the configuration data, we bypass all dynamic antianalysis features that would otherwise prevent accurate and reliable analysis.

How Do We Build ACCE Support?
ACCE is built on top of CT’s proprietary libraries, as well as the Department of Defense
Cyber Crime Center’s (DC3) Malware Configuration Parser (MWCP) and kordesii
frameworks. This promotes an automation workflow where initial YARA signature detections
prompt running targeted modules organized by capability, to extract layers of components
(RoboSki packer-> ReZer0 loader -> Agent Tesla payload) and report configuration at each

12/16

layer. By adopting the ACCE workflow, Reverse Engineers can develop modules based upon
analysis of a few samples, and then leverage that module to continue to extract results from
thousands of other related malware variants.
The primary difference between the newly analyzed RoboSki packer and previous RoboSki
packers is the way the ReZer0 loader is encrypted. Previously written code for parsing the
PNG pixels of the image resource was used in conjunction with new code for obtaining and
using the resource name and initial XOR key using construct, regex patterns, and an internal
library.

Figure 12: Construct PAYLOAD_SPEC
The referenced resource is acquired, PNG pixels are parsed, and the resulting data is
parsed using the construct PAYLOAD_SPEC.

Subsequently, the ReZer0 loader is decrypted and dispatched for further processing. The
configuration output for the RoboSki packer (MD5: 9b792353406c1c8bf440fa5417aee5b2)
which contained the LokiBot sample with C2 domains previously observed in other
campaigns:

Threat Hunting Using ACCE Output
After adding a parser module to automatically extract the RoboSki component and ReZer0
loader from the new RoboSki packer variant, we used VirusTotal to find additional samples
using the new RoboSki packer variant. As a result, 55 samples were selected to test against
the new parser module.
Two variations in the initial RoboSki packer were observed:
1. In addition to being hex-encoded, the .NET Microsoft resource name and base XOR
key are Base64 encoded.
2. A .NET obfuscator is leveraged to encrypt all strings in the RoboSki packer, inhibiting
the ability to easily extract the resource name and base XOR key.
All 55 RoboSki packer samples contained the same RoboSki decryption component.
After updating the parser module(s) to support the variations observed in the RoboSki
packer, approximately 1300 additional RoboSki packer samples were obtained via
VirusTotal, and subsequently run against the capability. The resultant payload distribution is
as denoted in the following chart:

Figure 14: Payload Distribution
The most common payload observed was Agent Tesla, accounting for over half of the
obtained payloads. Notably, all the payloads fell into a category of commodity malware such
as information stealers or commercial RATs.

An Ever-Evolving Commodity Malware Scene
Malware distribution is a continually evolving practice that’s undertaken by potential botnet
herders and spam distributors alike, constantly on the quest to bypass organizational
security controls to deliver malware. As part of that ecosystem, commodity packers, such as

15/16

RoboSki, are used extensively to spread numerous types of malicious code. Keeping up to
date about new variations, IOCs, and overall delivery TTPs are essential to keeping
networks free of malware that could eventually result in more advanced compromises.
To avoid the associated risks that come with a reliance on digital exchange for operations,
the use of automation to rapidly generate indicators can help equip Net Defenders with the
necessary insight to identify and prevent compromise. X-Force and CT analysts assess with
high confidence that the use of ordering and logistics themed phishing emails will persist,
especially as global trade continues to recover. Organizations especially engaged in the
import and export of items worldwide, should exercise extreme caution and harden their
network environments.
