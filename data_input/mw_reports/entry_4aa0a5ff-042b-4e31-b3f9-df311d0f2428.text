Minerva Labs has uncovered malicious software that implements a new evasive
cryptocurrency mining campaign.

This post explains the nature of malicious cryptocurrency miners (cryptominers), dissects the
newly discovered malware, and explains its evasive techniques and infection vectors that the
adversaries employed to get around endpoint security tools. We also provide details about
the identity of the person who is likely behind this campaign.

The Monero Gold Rush
Cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly common. Bitcoin is the most widely adopted
example, having gained popularity among even the non-tech-savvy crowds, and accepted by
well-known retailers like Expedia.

But Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency out there. There are more than 10 different
cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding 1 billion US dollars including Ethereum,
Litecoin, ZCash and Monero. Some are very similar, but others significantly differ in the
mathematical and computational properties of their implementation.
It is possible to gain cryptocurrency as a reward for performing heavy computational
operations, this process is often referred to as mining. Crypto-mining malware abuses its
victim’s resources to perform the heavy computational operations required in the mining
process, while the cybercriminal collects the reward for the mining. Lately, we saw an
increase in malware mining a specific type of cryptocurrency – Monero. Monero’s design
makes it anonymous and virtually untraceable, causing it to be highly popular among
cybercriminals.
Last May Proofpoint uncovered the Adylkuzz Monero mining malware which shared the
same exploits as WannaCry to spread laterally.
Additional examples of controversial mining of Monero were observed last month, when the
security researcher @PaulWebSec observed that popular websites such as CBS
Showtime, The Pirate Bay and many others executed code that “borrowed” CPU time from
their visitors to mine Monero:

Minerva recently discovered another illicit Monero-mining campaign, which deployed
malicious Monero miners and targeted Russian-speaking individuals, as described below.

What is WaterMiner?
The intercepted campaign, which we dubbed WaterMiner, infects victims with a simple yet
effective Monero mining malware which is designed to hide from endpoint monitoring tools.
How effective could such mining software be on consumer-grade CPUs? After all, it’s no
longer feasible to mine some of the more established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin
without a special dedicated pricy setup utilizing high-end customized electronics.
Interestingly, it turns out that mining Monero on machines with regular CPUs is still effective
due to the nature of the cryptographic algorithm that Monero uses. This feasibility, combined
with the anonymous nature of its design, makes Monero even more attractive to
cybercriminals.
The attackers spread WaterMiner by illicitly bundling this crypto-mining malware with gaming
“mods”, which patched computer games to augment or bypass their functionality. The
campaigned distributed the malicious software on a Russian-speaking forum. For instance,
one of the Trojanized mods claimed to “enhance” the popular R-rated game GTA. It was
distributed to the victims under the name “Arbuz” - watermelon in Russian, which is why we
named the campaign WaterMiner.
Several forum members posted a download link to the Trojanized file on different forums,
marketing its various features to the potential victims, even adding a link to a clean scan of
the mod on VirusTotal.

nickname
The mod, bundled with the miner’s downloader, was hosted at Yandex.Disk, the Russian
equivalent of Google Drive or Dropbox, as a RAR archive. The RAR file provides the
proclaimed mod functionality; however, among the dozens of files, it includes a file called

“pawncc.exe”, as shown in the following screenshot. This is the bridgehead which will
download the cryptominer once the mod is executed.

Once executed on the victim’s system, pawncc.exe acts as a downloader, launching a chain
of events that results in the execution of the WaterMiner malware.
The pawncc.exe process begins by verifying that the machine is not already infected with
this malicious software. If the miner is not already present, it creates an infection marker. The
infection marker creates the registry key “HKLM\Software\IntelPlatform” with the value
named “Ld566xsMp01a” set to “Nothing”:

infection marker
Next, pawncc.exe downloads WaterMiner to the temp folder from a Google Drive link. It sets
the value of the infection marker to “loaded” and the miner will be executed on a new
process named “Intel (R) Security Assistent.exe”:

5/17

Download the miner, save it to the temp folder and execute it as “Intel (R) Security
Assistent.exe”
The malware will not procced to the next stage if the infection marker’s value is already set
to“loaded”, making this simple registry value an effective vaccine against it.
You may see in the image below the test for the infection marker. The lower block, which
includes the function in charge of downloading and executing the malware, will be skipped if
the infection marker is already present and set to “Loaded”:

The second code block is skipped if the infection marker is found
While examining the downloader, Minerva found unique indicators, which helped trace
the source code of an earlier version on Pastebin, an online copy and paste service. The
author’s comments within the source explicitly refer to the `mining functionality and indicate
that the attacker intentionally included the miner as part of the mod:

Interesting comments by Martin 0pc0d3r in an earlier version of the miner’s downloader
Translated from Russian, the first part of the comments goes through existing functionality:
·

Loading 11 miner files to the temp folder

·

Adding persistency mechanism

·

Hiding the files and the persistency mechanism

·

Downloading the miner files only once

There are even some comments in the TODO section, suggesting the upcoming
improvements to the miner:
·

Creating a backup of the miner files

·

Using the task scheduler for persistency

·

Execute the miner as a service to hide it

pawncc.exe downloads the mining software to the victim’s system and saves it in
“%TEMP%\Intel(R) Security Assistent.exe”, a 64-bit executable
The miner establishes persistence to survive any reboots using the registry, hiding under a
RunOnce key, disguised as an “Oracle Corporation” application:

Next, it will start mining and will communicate with xmr.pool.minergate.com on TCP port
45560. This hostname belongs to a mining pool. These pools are a collaboration of multiple
miners, enabling them to share their resources and rewards according to their contribution to
the pool. At the moment, there are dozens of Monero mining pools available to the public.
After examining the miner, Minerva observed that it is a modified version of the common
open-source miner called XMRig:

On the left - XMRig instructions, on the right - strings extracted from the customized miner
XMRig is not malicious on its own, but installing it on systems without authorization to gain
illicit profit from unsuspecting victims, is not a legit use case.
Minerva also came across older versions of the dropper, which distributed a different miner
called Nice Hash. However, the adversary switched to XMRig probably because Nice Hash
required almost a dozen of different files to run properly on the victim’s system.

Fooling Victims, Hiding in Plain Sight
Miners are performing heavy computational calculations as part of the mining process so
naturally, they consume a significant percentage of its victim’s CPU. This means that the
victim will notice the anomaly when the infected system suddenly slows down. To investigate,
the person will probably open the Windows task manager or equivalent apps to inspect,
which application is slowing down the system. In the WaterMiner campaign, the attacker
chose to evade detection by tweaking the original XMRig to continuously search if there is an
open window titled:
·

Windows Task Manager (in English and Russian)

·

Task Manager

·

AnVir (Russian task manager equivalent)

·

Process Hacker

An excerpt from the tweaked XMRig code that checks for these windows is captured in the
following screenshot:

Window titles that will cause WaterMiner to stop mining to evade detection
If the miner detects any of the above apps, the mining operation would halt, making it less
likely that the victim will detect the presence of the malicious program.
Malware variants that the same attacker spread in earlier campaigns included a different
type of test: instead of looking for windows, the miner tried to detect the monitoring apps by
inspecting the running process list and terminating itself if any of the processes shown in the
screenshot below are found:

If Task Manager or AnVir are found - call taskkill to terminate the malware
Minerva’s Anti-Evasion Platform blocks WaterMiner malware by making it believe that it
is constantly monitored – forcing it to avoid any mining activity by exploiting the miner’s own
evasive design.

Who is behind WaterMiner?
In the world of cybercrime, we often come-across well-organized gangs. However, it seems
that Monero also attracts resourceful individuals who are not the classic attackers we might
imagine as criminal masterminds, just like Alaska lured many unskilled miners during the
gold rush.

According to several forum posts and the source code Minerva tracked down, the person
behind the WaterMiner campaign appears to hide under the alias “Martin Opc0d3r”, and has
some history in developing other forms of questionable or malicious software, such as autoaiming bots and mods for computer games. However, it seems that lately he realized it’s
possible to earn money from his popular mods by infecting his “clients” with multiple types of
malware, including cryptominers.
Minerva located the URL hardcoded in one of the WaterMiner samples,
hxxp://cw36634[.]tmweb[.]ru/getfile[.]php?file=12, to at least a dozen more samples created
by the same actor, downloaded from almost identical URLs:

12/17

Minerva located additional samples that used another domain, with a URL that followed a
similar pattern:

Some of the payloads are no longer available and were probably removed either by the
hosting services provider or by the attacker himself. Yet, from an inspection of those that are
available, we found various versions of the tweaked XMRig and NiceHash miners showing
great resemblance to previous samples and code snippets we associated with the
WaterMiner campaign. Another one of 0pc0d3r’s snippets publicly available on Pastebin,
makes us believe that some of the payloads, which are no longer available in the above links
were Trojans:

13/17

One of the comments mentions a Trojan, possibly extracted from a different file at runtime
Other evidence suggesting older Trojanized mods of 0pc0d3r were detected by end users. In
the thread Minerva located on another Russian forum,
hxxps://video[.]fishyoutube[.]com/watch?v=lU0xJSuj-ZM, we observed the publication of a
different mod. Its users posted comments to flag it with words such as “stealer”, “Trojan” and
called 0pc0d3r “the result of incest”:

14/17

From 0pc0d3r’s poor operational security (opsec), it is clear that we are not dealing with an
experienced cybercriminal. By following the activities associated with this alias, we
discovered the possible identity of the person behind it.
In the Russian social network VK, one of 0pc0d3r’s mods was offered by a different identity ,
Anton [ redacted]:

15/17

When a user blamed Anton for reselling 0pc0d3r’s work, Anton proudly admitted to be the
man behind this identity:

Combined with other sensitive information we collected when analyzing this campaign, we
believe that Anton is likely to be 0pc0d3r – the man behind WaterMiner.

Conclusions and Recommendations
There cannot be good without bad, and this applies to the rapidly growing industry of
cryptocurrencies. This innovative field, mixing cutting-edge cryptography with abstract
economic ideas like fungibility, is not immune to individuals abusing it to make quick money
through illicit means.
At the moment, cryptominers are not very sophisticated and backlisting host and port
combinations will successfully block most miners. However, we predict that mining-malware
will become increasingly sophisticated and will maneuver around firewall and IPS\IDS
products. Fortunately, just like other more conventional malware, the more evasive such
malware is, the more effective Minerva’s Anti-Evasion Platform is at stopping it.
