Cybercrime underground flush with shipping companies’
credentials

One of the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is the havoc it has wreaked on the
global supply chain. There have been extreme fluctuations in the availability of goods, ports
around the world are severely backlogged with full containers, and shipping and logistics
companies are having trouble finding workers to transport cargo. It is a precarious situation
for this sector, especially as the holiday season approaches.
With things as volatile as they are, a cybersecurity crisis at one of these logistics and shipping
companies could have a calamitous impact on the global consumer economy. Over the past
few months, Intel 471 has observed network access brokers selling credentials or other forms
of access to shipping and logistics companies on the cybercrime underground. These
companies operate air, ground and maritime cargo transport on several continents that are
responsible for moving billions of dollars worth of goods around the world.
The actors responsible for selling these credentials range from newcomers to the most
prolific network access brokers that Intel 471 tracks. These actors have obtained these
credentials by leveraging well-known vulnerabilities in remote access solutions like Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP), VPN, Citrix, and SonicWall, among others.
Among the advertisements observed by Intel 471:
Within the span of two weeks in July 2021, one new actor and one well-known
access broker claimed to have access to a network owned by a Japanese container
transportation and shipping company. The new actor included the company’s
credentials in a dump of approximately 50 companies, allegedly all obtained via
compromised Citrix, Cisco, virtual private network (VPN) and/or remote desktop
protocol (RDP) accounts. The well-known actor claimed to have access to several
accounts belonging to the company, but did not reveal how they were obtained.

In August 2021, one actor known to work with groups that have deployed Conti
ransomware claimed access to corporate networks belonging to a U.S.-based
transportation management and trucking software supplier and a U.S.-based
commodity transportation services company. The actor gave the group access to an
undisclosed botnet powered by malware that included a virtual network computing
(VNC) function. The group used the botnet to download and execute a Cobalt Strike
beacon on infected machines, so group members in charge of breaching computer
networks received access directly via a Cobalt Strike beacon session.
In September 2021, an actor with ties to the FiveHands ransomware group claimed
access to hundreds of companies, including a U.K.-based logistics company. It’s most
likely that access was obtained through a SonicWall vulnerability, given that FiveHands
is known to use that access to launch its ransomware attacks. Additionally in
September, a new actor claimed to have gained access to a Bangladesh-based shipping
and logistics company through a vulnerability in the PulseSecure VPN.
In October 2021, a newcomer to a well-known cybercrime forum claimed access to
the network of a U.S.-based freight forwarding company, alleging that he had had local
administrator rights and could access 20 computers on the company’s network. The
actor claimed he obtained the credentials through a path traversal vulnerability in
Fortinet’s FortiGate secure sockets layer (SSL) VPN web portal (CVE-2018-13379). Also
in October, a newcomer on a different well-known cybercrime forum claimed access to
a Malaysian logistics company. Those credentials were part of a package that the actor
was selling for $5,000. It was unknown how he allegedly obtained those credentials.
The world has previously seen the economic damage that can come from a cyber attack on
the shipping and logistics industry. The NotPetya attack in 2017 devastated Danish shipping
and maritime giant Maersk, shutting down several of its ports and costing the company $300
million to replace systems damaged by the malware. Adam Banks, head of technology at
Maersk, told a business publication in 2019 that “there was 100 [percent] destruction of
anything based on Microsoft that was attached to the network.”
We have seen attackers try to go after ports this year. In August, suspected foreign
government-backed hackers breached a computer network at the Port of Houston, one of the
largest ports on the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, early detection of the incident thwarted any
attempts to impede business operations.
Those two incidents show that the logistics industry is constantly targeted, and the
ramifications of a cyberattack can have a crippling ripple effect on the global economy. At a
time when this sector is struggling to keep things operating, a successful attack could bring
this industry to a screeching halt, resulting in unforeseen dire consequences for every part of
the consumer economy. It's extremely beneficial that security teams in the shipping industry

monitor and track adversaries, their tools and malicious behavior to stop attacks from these
criminals. Proactively addressing vulnerabilities in times of high alert avoids further stress on
already constrained business operations.
