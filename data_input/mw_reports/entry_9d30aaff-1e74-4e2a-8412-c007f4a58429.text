One of the most notable carding shops may be shutting down for good.
The Joker’s Stash shop will be closing operations on Feb. 15, 2021, according to the site’s
owner. In a message board post on a popular Russian-language cybercrime forum, the
operator said the site is closing “forever” and its team is heading into a “well-deserved
retirement.”
“When we opened years ago, nobody knew us. Today we are one of the largest cards/dumps
marketplace,” the post reads. “Unfortunately, or fortunately - nothing lasts forever. It’s time
for us to leave forever.”
The announcement comes weeks after the U.S. Department of Justice and INTERPOL
allegedly seized proxy servers used in connection with the blockchain-based domains
belonging to Joker’s Stash. Shortly after the action, the site’s operators took to several
underground forums to stress that the shop would go back to normal after access was
restored.
Joker’s Stash's fall comes after a very turbulent close to 2020. In October, the actor who
allegedly runs the site announced he had contracted COVID-19, spending a week in the
hospital. The condition impacted the site’s forums, inventory replenishments and other
operations. Intel 471 also observed the site’s clients complaining that the shop’s payment
card data quality was increasingly poor.
In the post, the operator said he plans to keep the site open for 30 days so users can spend
their account balance. Any partners would be paid out before the site shuts down.
The post also stresses that the site’s servers and backups will be wiped after February 15.
"We are also want to wish all young and mature ones cyber-gangsters not to lose themselves
in the pursuit of easy money,” the post reads. “Remember, that even all the money in the
world will never make you happy and that all the most truly valuable things in this life are
free.”
