I found a new dropper

c580d77722d85238ed76689a17b0205b4d980c010bef9616b8611ffba21b142e with the
same signature of others. But it changes the exploitation. Before, it uses the ole package to
drop a 8.t file in %appdata% and decode two files, a legit file and an backdoor (PlugX,
newcore rat, sysfader…).
Now it’s a big object ole mapped in memory and one PE is used to drop the files.

RTF exploit
Now we have four object oles in the RTF.

this RTF exploits again the CVE-2017_1882 on eqnedt32.exe.
The biggest object is a new exe to overwritten the first eqnedt32.exe . This PE is decoded
by the shellcode of the exploit and executes this PE.

It’s the same algorithm of the exploit targeting Vietnam.

1/11

Just the init key has changed.

Dropper
the PE creates a directory in %appdata% named IISWebClient

After, it decrypt a buffer in the address space of the executable with a xor.

2/11

After the decoding, the PE decompresses and drops three files on the disk: iassvcs.exe
developed and signed by Symantec, sqlite3.dll signed by the av 360 and RasTls.dll the
backdoor.
The first step is to call dropfile

3/11

In this function the first step is to allocate at 0016000 a memory page and to decompress
the file before writing on the disk.

4/11

the function decompress loads dynamically the function RtlDecompressBuffer and use it.

In the debugger, theses steps are:
5/11

CreateFile

Decompress

6/11

Write the buffer on the disk after decompressing

And the dropper execute the iassvcs.exe to make a side loading and make the persistence.

at each executable or cmd line, the executable is reloaded.

7/11

In a second part, I’ll analysed the backdoor.

Threat Intelligence
the backdoor contacts hxxps://skylineqaz.crabdance.com/
the domain resolves 154.223.167.20. This IP is very interesting because it connects with
tele.zyns.com and old infrastructures used by chinese APT or DDOS Chinese team against
the ancient soviet republics.
Also, the name of domains show the targets is energy and telecom sectors.
they find uzwatersource.dynamic-dns.net used by Icefog connected by the 150.129.80.184
to tele.zyns.com
uzwatersource.dynamic-dns.net connects to tajikstantravel.dynamic-dns.net by
45.252.63.244.
The domain tajikstantravel.dynamic-dns.net connected to ddos infrastructure chinese.

Another thing is the dropper what has submitted by an ID coming of the Kazakhstan. So
Goblin Panda targets it ?
