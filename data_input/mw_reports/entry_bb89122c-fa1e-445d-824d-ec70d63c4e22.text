North Korean Advanced Persistent Threat
Focus: Kimsuky
SUMMARY
Callout Box: This advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common
Knowledge (ATT&CK®) version 7 framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 7 for all
referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
This joint cybersecurity advisory was coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber
National Mission Force (CNMF). This advisory describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) used by North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group Kimsuky—against worldwide
targets—to gain intelligence on various topics of interest to the North Korean government. The U.S.
Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea.
This advisory describes known Kimsuky TTPs, as found in open-source and intelligence reporting
through July 2020. The target audience for this advisory is commercial sector businesses desiring to
protect their networks from North Korean APT activity.

Key Findings
This advisory’s key findings are:

The Kimsuky APT group has most likely been operating since 2012.
Kimsuky is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering
mission.
Kimsuky employs common social engineering tactics, spearphishing, and watering hole
attacks to exfiltrate desired information from victims.1,2
Kimsuky is most likely to use spearphishing to gain initial access into victim hosts or
networks.3
Kimsuky conducts its intelligence collection activities against individuals and organizations in
South Korea, Japan, and the United States.
Kimsuky focuses its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security
issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.
Kimsuky specifically targets:
o Individuals identified as experts in various fields,

Think tanks, and
South Korean government entities.4,5,6,7,8

CISA, FBI, and CNMF recommend individuals and organizations within this target profile
increase their defenses and adopt a heightened state of awareness. Particularly important
mitigations include safeguards against spearphishing, use of multi-factor authentication, and
user awareness training.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Initial Access
Kimsuky uses various spearphishing and social engineering methods to obtain Initial Access
[TA0001] to victim networks.9,10,11 Spearphishing—with a malicious attachment embedded in the
email—is the most observed Kimsuky tactic (Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001]).12,13
•

•

The APT group has used web hosting credentials—stolen from victims outside of their usual
targets—to host their malicious scripts and tools. Kimsuky likely obtained the credentials from
the victims via spearphishing and credential harvesting scripts. On the victim domains, they
have created subdomains mimicking legitimate sites and services they are spoofing, such as
Google or Yahoo mail.14
Kimsuky has also sent benign emails to targets, which were possibly intended to build trust in
advance of a follow-on email with a malicious attachment or link.
o Posing as South Korean reporters, Kimsuky exchanged several benign interviewthemed emails with their intended target to ostensibly arrange an interview date and

possibly build rapport. The emails contained the subject line “Skype Interview requests
of [Redacted TV Show] in Seoul,” and began with a request to have the recipient
appear as a guest on the show. The APT group invited the targets to a Skype interview
on the topic of inter-Korean issues and denuclearization negotiations on the Korean
Peninsula.
After a recipient agreed to an interview, Kimsuky sent a subsequent email with a
malicious document, either as an attachment or as a Google Drive link within the body.
The document usually contained a variant of BabyShark malware (see the Execution
section for information on BabyShark). When the date of the interview drew near,
Kimsuky sent an email canceling the interview.

Kimsuky tailors its spearphishing and social engineering approaches to use topics relevant to
the target, such as COVID-19, the North Korean nuclear program, or media interviews.15,16,17

Kimsuky’s other methods for obtaining initial access include login-security-alert-themed phishing
emails, watering hole attacks, distributing malware through torrent sharing sites, and directing victims
to install malicious browser extensions (Phishing: Spearphising Link [T1566.002], Drive-by
Compromise [T1189], Man-in-the-Browser [T1185]).18

Execution
After obtaining initial access, Kimsuky uses BabyShark malware and PowerShell or the Windows
Command Shell for Execution [TA0002].
•

BabyShark is Visual Basic Script (VBS)-based malware.
o First, the compromised host system uses the native Microsoft Windows utility,
mshta.exe, to download and execute an HTML application (HTA) file from a remote
system (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta [T1218.005]).
o The HTA file then downloads, decodes, and executes the encoded BabyShark VBS
file.
o The script maintains Persistence [TA0003] by creating a Registry key that runs on
startup (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
[T1547.001]).

It then collects system information (System Information Discovery [T1082]), sends it to
the operator’s command control (C2) servers, and awaits further commands.19,20,21,22

Open-source reporting indicates BabyShark is delivered via an email message containing a
link or an attachment (see Initial Access section for more information) (Phishing: Spearphising
Link [T1566.002], Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001]). Kimsuky tailors email
phishing messages to match its targets’ interests. Observed targets have been U.S. think
tanks and the global cryptocurrency industry.23
Kimsuky uses PowerShell to run executables from the internet without touching the physical
hard disk on a computer by using the target’s memory (Command and Scripting Interpreter:
PowerShell [T1059.001]). PowerShell commands/scripts can be executed without invoking
powershell.exe through HTA files or mshta.exe.24, 25, 26, 27

Persistence
Kimsuky has demonstrated the ability to establish Persistence [TA0003] through using malicious
browser extensions, modifying system processes, manipulating the autostart execution, using
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and changing the default file association for an application. By
using these methods, Kimsuky can gain login and password information and/or launch malware
outside of some application allowlisting solutions.
•

In 2018, Kimsuky used an extension, which was available on the Google Chrome Web Store,
to infect victims and steal passwords and cookies from their browsers (Man-in-the-Browser
[T1185]). The extension’s reviews gave it a five-star rating, however the text of the reviews
applied to other extensions or was negative. The reviews were likely left by compromised
Google+ accounts.28

Kimsuky may install a new service that can execute at startup by using utilities to interact with
services or by directly modifying the Registry keys (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
[T1547]). The service name may be disguised with the name from a related operating system
function or by masquerading as benign software. Services may be created with administrator
privileges but are executed under system privileges, so an adversary can also use a service to
escalate privileges from Administrator to System. They can also directly start services through
Service Execution.29, 30
During the STOLEN PENCIL operation in May 2018, Kimsuky used the GREASE malware.
GREASE is a tool capable of adding a Windows administrator account and enabling RDP
while avoiding firewall rules (Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol [T1021.001]).31
Kimsuky uses a document stealer module that changes the default program associated with
Hangul Word Processor (HWP) documents (.hwp files) in the Registry (Event Triggered
Execution: Change Default File Association [T1546.001]). Kimsuky manipulates the default
Registry setting to open a malicious program instead of the legitimate HWP program (HWP is
a Korean word processor). The malware will read and email the content from HWP documents
before the legitimate HWP program ultimately opens the document.32 Kimsuky also targets
Microsoft Office users by formatting their documents in a .docx file rather than .hwp and will
tailor their macros accordingly.33
Kimsuky maintains access to compromised domains by uploading actor-modified versions of
open-source Hypertext Processor (PHP)-based web shells; these web shells enable the APT
actor to upload, download, and delete files and directories on the compromised domains
(Server Software Component: Web Shell [T1505.003]). The actor often adds “Dinosaur”
references within the modified web shell codes.34

Privilege Escalation
Kimsuky uses well-known methods for Privilege Escalation [TA0004]. These methods include placing
scripts in the Startup folder, creating and running new services, changing default file associations,
and injecting malicious code in explorer.exe.

Kimsuky has used Win7Elevate—an exploit from the Metasploit framework—to bypass the
User Account Control to inject malicious code into explorer.exe (Process Injection [T1055]).
This malicious code decrypts its spying library—a collection of keystroke logging and remote
control access tools and remote control download and execution tools—from resources,
regardless of the victim’s operating system. It then saves the decrypted file to a disk with a
random but hardcoded name (e.g., dfe8b437dd7c417a6d.tmp) in the user’s temporary folder
and loads this file as a library, ensuring the tools are then on the system even after a reboot.
This allows for the escalation of privileges.35
Before the injection takes place, the malware sets the necessary privileges (see figure 1). The
malware writes the path to its malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and ensures the remote
process is loaded by creating a remote thread within explorer.exe (Process Injection
[T1055]).36

Kimsuky uses well-known and widely available methods for Defense Evasion [TA0005] within a
network. These methods include disabling security tools, deleting files, and using Metasploit. 38,39
•

Kimsuky’s malicious DLL runs at startup to zero (i.e., turn off) the Windows firewall Registry
keys (see figure 2). This disables the Windows system firewall and turns off the Windows
Security Center service, which prevents the service from alerting the user about the disabled
firewall (see figure 2) (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall [T1562.004]).40

Figure 2: Disabled firewall values in the Registry41
•
•

Kimsuky has used a keylogger that deletes exfiltrated data on disk after it is transmitted to its
C2 server (Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion [T1070.004]).42
Kimsuky has used mshta.exe, which is a utility that executes Microsoft HTAs. It can be used
for proxy execution of malicious .hta files and JavaScript or VBS through a trusted windows
utility (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta [T1218.005]). It can also be used to bypass
application allowlisting solutions (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Access
Control [T1548.002]).43, 44

Win7Elevate—which was noted above—is also used to evade traditional security measures.
Win7Elevatve is a part of the Metasploit framework open-source code and is used to inject
malicious code into explorer.exe (Process Injection [T1055]). The malicious code decrypts
its spying library from resources, saves the decrypted file to disk with a random but hardcoded
name in the victim's temporary folder, and loads the file as a library.45,46,47

Credential Access
Kimsuky uses legitimate tools and network sniffers to harvest credentials from web browsers, files,
and keyloggers (Credential Access [TA0006]).
•

•

Kimsuky uses memory dump programs instead of using well-known malicious software and
performs the credential extraction offline. Kimsuky uses ProcDump, a Windows command line
administration tool, also available for Linux, that allows a user to create crash dumps/core
dumps of processes based upon certain criteria, such as high central processing unit (CPU)
utilization (OS Credential Dumping [T1003]). ProcDump monitors for CPU spikes and
generates a crash dump when a value is met; it passes information to a Word document
saved on the computer. It can be used as a general process dump utility that actors can
embed in other scripts, as seen by Kimsuky’s inclusion of ProcDump in the BabyShark
malware.48
According to open-source security researchers, Kimsuky abuses a Chrome extension to steal
passwords and cookies from browsers (Man-in-the-Browser [T1185]).49,50 The spearphishing
email directs a victim to a phishing site, where the victim is shown a benign PDF document but
is not able to view it. The victim is then redirected to the official Chrome Web Store page to
install a Chrome extension, which has the ability to steal cookies and site passwords and
loads a JavaScript file, named jQuery.js, from a separate site (see figure 3).51

Kimsuky also uses a PowerShell based keylogger, named MECHANICAL, and a network
sniffing tool, named Nirsoft SniffPass (Input Capture: Keylogging [T1056.001], Network
Sniffing [T1040]). MECHANICAL logs keystrokes to
%userprofile%\appdata\roaming\apach.{txt,log} and is also a "cryptojacker," which is
a tool that uses a victim’s computer to mine cryptocurrency. Nirsoft SniffPass is capable of
obtaining passwords sent over non-secure protocols.53
Kimsuky used actor-modified versions of PHProxy, an open-source web proxy written in PHP,
to examine web traffic between the victim and the website accessed by the victims and to
collect any credentials entered by the victim.54

Discovery
Kimsuky enumerates system information and the file structure for victims’ computers and networks
(Discovery [TA0007]). Kimsuky appears to rely on using the victim’s operating system command
prompt to enumerate the file structure and system information (File and Directory Discovery [T1083]).

The information is directed to C:\WINDOWS\msdatl3.inc, read by malware, and likely emailed to the
malware’s command server.55

Collection
Kimsuky collects data from the victim system through its HWP document malware and its keylogger
(Collection [TA0009]). The HWP document malware changes the default program association in the
Registry to open HWP documents (Event Triggered Execution: Change Default File Association
[T1546.001]). When a user opens an HWP file, the Registry key change triggers the execution of
malware that opens the HWP document and then sends a copy of the HWP document to an account
under the adversary’s control. The malware then allows the user to open the file as normal without
any indication to the user that anything has occurred. The keylogger intercepts keystrokes and writes
them to C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Ole DB\msolui80.inc and records the active
window name where the user pressed keys (Input Capture: Keylogging [T1056.001]). There is
another keylogger variant that logs keystrokes into C:\WINDOWS\setup.log.56
Kimsuky has also used a Mac OS Python implant that gathers data from Mac OS systems and sends
it to a C2 server (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python [T1059.006]). The Python program
downloads various implants based on C2 options specified after the filedown.php (see figure 4).

Command and Control
Kimsuky has used a modified TeamViewer client, version 5.0.9104, for Command and Control
[TA0011] (Remote Access Software [T1219]). During the initial infection, the service “Remote Access
Service” is created and adjusted to execute C:\Windows\System32\vcmon.exe at system startup
(Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder [T1547.001]). Every time
vcmon.exe is executed, it disables the firewall by zeroing out Registry values (Impair Defenses:
Disable or Modify System Firewall [T1562.004]). The program then modifies the TeamViewer Registry

settings by changing the TeamViewer strings in TeamViewer components. The launcher then
configures several Registry values, including SecurityPasswordAES, that control how the remote
access tool will work. The SecurityPasswordAES Registry value represents a hash of the password
used by a remote user to connect to TeamViewer Client (Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass
the Hash [T1550.002]). This way, the attackers set a pre-shared authentication value to have access
to the TeamViewer Client. The attacker will then execute the TeamViewer client netsvcs.exe.58
Kimsuky has been using a consistent format. In the URL used recently—express[.]php?op=1—
there appears to be an option range from 1 to 3.59

Exfiltration
Open-source reporting from cybersecurity companies describes two different methods Kimsuky has
used to exfiltrate stolen data: via email or through an RC4 key generated as an MD5 hash or a
randomly generated 117-bytes buffer (Exfiltration [TA0010]).
There was no indication that the actor destroyed computers during the observed exfiltrations,
suggesting Kimsuky’s intention is to steal information, not to disrupt computer networks. Kimsuky’s
preferred method for sending or receiving exfiltrated information is through email, with their malware
on the victim machine encrypting the data before sending it to a C2 server (Archive Collected Data
[T1560]). Kimsuky also sets up auto-forward rules within a victim’s email account (Email Collection:
Email Forwarding Rule [T1114.003]).
Kimsuky also uses an RC4 key generated as an MD5 hash or a randomly generated 117-bytes buffer
to exfiltrate stolen data. The data is sent RSA-encrypted (Encrypted Channel: Symmetric
Cryptography [T1573.001]). Kimsuky’s malware constructs an 1120-bit public key and uses it to
encrypt the 117-bytes buffer. The resulting data file is saved in C:\Program Files\Common
Files\System\Ole DB\ (Data Staged: Local Data Staging [T1074.001]).60

MITIGATIONS
Indicators of Compromise
