WHITE PAPER

Executive Summary
Security researchers and network defenders have written many words on ransomware, yet many organizations
continue to react tactically to such attacks rather than with mindful intent. This is due in part to the lack of ground
truth knowledge about ransomware. Ransomware encryption speed is one area that merits further study. To date,
the most comprehensive information on this subject comes from the LockBit ransomware authors themselves,
who provide a comparison of ransomware family encryption speeds on their website to advertise that they are the
“fastest.” This paper aims to illuminate an area of study that was previously left to criminals. Utilizing the scientific
method in a controlled environment, we measured the speed at which 10 variants of popular ransomware malware
encrypted nearly 100,000 files, totalling nearly 53GB, across different Windows operating systems and hardware
specifications. Through this work, we hope to give defenders more knowledge and confidence to move “left of boom"
with their detections rather than waiting to detect during the “actions on objective” phase that is discussed in the
Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain whitepaper.
To determine the speed of ransomware encryption, we created a modified version of the Splunk Attack Range lab
environment to execute 10 samples of each of the 10 ransomware variants on four hosts. Two hosts ran the operating
system Windows 10 and the other two hosts ran Windows Server 2019. We chose to attribute the ransomware
samples to each variant by only selecting samples confirmed by Microsoft Defender Antivirus in VirusTotal. We
assigned each host "high" or "mid" level resources to test how ransomware would behave with different processors,
memory, and hard drive configurations. We enabled Windows logging on each host to collect, synthesize, and
analyze the data in Splunk. This allowed us to measure how fast the ransomware variants encrypted nearly 100,000
files, and how the ransomware utilized system resources like processor, memory and disk.
After running all one hundred ransomware samples, we determined the total time to encrypt (TTE) varied from four
minutes to three and a half hours with a median speed of 42 minutes. This narrow timeline provides a limited window
for organizations to effectively respond before encryption is complete. When comparing identical ransomware
strains across systems with different resources, we found some variables could impact TTE, such as processor
speeds or CPU cores. However, the impact was inconsistent, implying that some ransomware was single-threaded or
minimally able to take advantage of additional resources. LockBit ransomware was the fastest variant to encrypt on
any system. This aligns with previous reports that LockBit only encrypts 4KB of each file, rendering the file unusable
and expediting the attack. The title of "fastest ransomware" also matches the LockBit developer's own public claims
on the group’s Tor website.
SURGe plans to build upon this research to create a comprehensive, high-level overview of ransomware for network
defenders. In particular, we plan to review the file access techniques of multiple ransomware samples using opensource file analysis framework tools like stoQ, fuzzy algorithms, and Splunk's Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK).
Furthermore, we plan to investigate claims that modern ransomware is not masked with packers and determine
if it is possible to cluster to-be-determined classifiers of unknown ransomware binaries as they are “deployed”
rather than detect them after execution. We plan to release the dataset for this research at .conf22 in June of 2022.
We encourage researchers to investigate this corpus and validate or build upon our findings to help the global
community of blue teamers.

Key Findings
• LockBit ransomware performed the fastest out of 10 ransomware variants in our testing, which aligns with the
ransomware group’s claims on their Tor site
• The median time for ransomware variants to encrypt across a corpus of 98,561 files measuring 53.83 GB, was 42
minutes and 52 seconds.
• Individual ransomware samples varied greatly in encryption speed, ranging from four minutes to three and a half hours.
• Improved hardware capabilities provided some ransomware samples with faster encryption speeds. Other
samples and variants were unable to take advantage of the increased resources, and at times they performed
worse on the systems with higher specifications. Additional memory did not have a significant effect on
encryption speed for any of the samples. Higher disk speeds may play a role in faster execution, but most likely in
combination with a variant that can take advantage of additional CPU cores.

Introduction
In the 2021 M-Trends report, Mandiant found that 25% of their investigations in 2020 involved ransomware, up
from 14% in 2019.1 The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) of 2021 states that ransomware doubled in
frequency from 2019 to 2021. 2 Although relatively new in the public consciousness, this style of malware has afflicted
the world since it was first introduced at an AIDS conference in 1989 via floppy disks. 3

Figure 1. Spunk chart highlighting the growth of ransomware families from 2013 to 2022.

The previously mentioned M-Trends report states that in the Americas, ransomware has a median dwell time of
three days. 4 A dwell time of three days does not sound ideal, but there is a long-held perception that ransomware
has a shorter dwell time of mere hours or even minutes. If the median dwell time is measured in days and not hours,
defenders have a small window of opportunity to take action. In 2021, CERT NZ published a whitepaper that outlines
the lifecycle of ransomware with recommendations to help organizations combat this growing threat (fig. 2).5

Figure 2. Detailed progression of a ransomware incident from CERT NZ.

This work by CERT NZ and the three-day dwell time cited by Mandiant
led us to question how organizations can actively defend against
ransomware. Before we began looking at defensive methodologies, we
decided to first investigate two questions:
• Primarily, how long do ransomware strains take to encrypt a host?
• Can an organization recover or prevent the complete encryption of file
systems?
Reverse engineers have done great work to learn why some
ransomware strains are so fast to encrypt. With the exception of an
advertisement from the Lockbit ransomware group, we were unable to
find any empirical study that compares the speed of encryption among
different ransomware families.6,7 This paper outlines our analysis of the
dynamically evaluated encryption speed for 10 ransomware families
and provides some suggestions for blue teamers to better inform their
defenses. It should be noted that this paper does not aim to create
ransomware detections. Rather, our objective is to inform defenders of
the holistic truth of ransomware encryption speeds.

analysis of the dynamically
evaluated encryption
speed for 10 ransomware
families and provides
some suggestions for blue
teamers to better inform
their defenses.”

WHITE PAPER

Setting the Stage
We started to brainstorm our hypothesis with unbounded questions about how fast ransomware encrypts and how
organizations can move “left of boom” if the ransomware encrypts quicker than expected.8 We began by synthesizing
our questions to a single hypothesis: If an adversary gains access to a system and deploys ransomware, then
encryption will occur faster than network defenders can realistically prevent. The Verizon DBIR states that the
majority of organizations detect breaches days after an adversary gains access to a system, rather than hours
or minutes.9 To test our hypothesis, we needed to create a lab for repeated testing, gather samples of different
ransomware binaries, and then analyze our findings. We also desired to conduct this research in a manner that
catered to blue teamers. Thus, we chose not to perform static reverse engineering work on the malware binaries,
but instead executed them dynamically in a controlled environment and measured them against the same variables.
We plan to include a detailed explanation of our methodology and technical process in future blogs, papers, and
conference presentations.
In this section of the whitepaper, we explain how we framed our experiment to test our hypothesis. We also detail
the high-level architecture, configuration of our malware lab, and how and why we sourced our malware. Finally, we
set out any known assumptions in our research and analysis that may present bias in our findings.

Methodology
To test our hypothesis, we needed to execute a variety of ransomware strains in a controlled environment, gather
native Windows performance telemetry data back from endpoint hosts, and analyze the data. We selected 10
ransomware families with 10 separate binaries from each of those families in order to prevent clustering illusion,
the tendency to see patterns where none exist, and confirmation bias, the tendency to seek out information
that supports one's beliefs. For each Windows endpoint type and resource specification, a single Amazon Web
Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was created for each family and each individual binary ran on its own
host specifically created for its evaluation. The results were forwarded to a central Splunk instance for analysis.
Every host had 98,561 files placed in 100 directories. These file types were sourced from the Digital Corpora and
deemed by the authors to be the most likely file types for ransomware binaries to encrypt.10,11,12 These files were made
available under the CC0 license and sourced from public U.S. government websites. Finally, we enabled Event ID
4663 on Windows hosts in order to see encryption on files and baseline the speed of each ransomware family.13

The Lab
As previously mentioned, the research was conducted against ransomware binaries executed in a controlled
environment. The performance of the ransomware was gathered using native Windows auditing and logging
capabilities that forwarded the results back to a Splunk instance. Details on the telemetry setup are covered in more
detail in the Experiment Procedure section. Each ransomware sample ran inside an independent, self-contained
environment. The Splunk instance in each ransomware environment forwarded the events to a single Splunk
instance for comparing, analyzing, and reporting. We created the lab by modifying Splunk’s open-source Attack
Range tool for our experiment (fig. 3).14 Attack Range allows network defenders to dynamically create small networks
in AWS with Splunk software and logging preconfigured using a combination of Terraform and Ansible.

Figure 3. A high-level overview of our custom Attack Range.

The hosts on this range had specifications that aligned with many modern laptop or server builds according to
organizations that we gathered anecdotal feedback from and popular websites like PC Mag.15 These hosts had
Microsoft Defender uninstalled, and no additional anti-virus (AV) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools
installed. We installed additional tools including a Splunk agent to send information back to Splunk and the Microsoft
application Sysmon.16 Finally, to detect any worming or remote mapped file encryption, these hosts were joined
to a Windows domain with an open network share (C Drive) on the domain controller. More information about the
host specifications and the logging configurations can be found in the appendices A and B. In order to capture file
encryption events, we enabled object level auditing on the test directory and all sub-directories for both successful
and failed access attempts. By enabling object level auditing, Event Code 4663 events were generated each time
the ransomware binary attempted to encrypt a file. The final 4663 event to conclude a successful encryption of a
file was DELETE, which is what we used to track encryption speed. While this event was seen consistently across the
families we tested, this DELETE event may not be present in other families. If this is the case, a different marker might
be needed to measure TTE.

Experiment Procedure
To best emulate modern ransomware campaigns, we executed the ransomware across 10 Windows 10 hosts and 10
Windows Server 2019 hosts via a remote PowerShell script located on the Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller.
This remote PowerShell method was used to initiate the ransomware infection as opposed to a user having to manually
execute the binary. This methodology had the added benefit of emulating modern ransomware campaigns where
ransomware is executed by human operators via scripts rather than by victims on desktops. Furthermore, it reduced
some overhead of “human interaction,” which allowed the ransomware to utilize more system resources than would have
otherwise been available. We did not pass any flags to the ransomware when it executed. The only ransomware variant
that we executed in a different manner was Babuk, as it would not run reliably using the remote PowerShell method, and
we therefore started Babuk interactively on each host. Two different hardware profiles for each operating system were
used to evaluate ransomware performance. The exact specifications for these profiles can be found in Appendix B.
The PowerShell script allowed us to select the ransomware sample we wanted to run. The script would then iterate
through the number of Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 hosts in the domain and initiate downloads of the
ransomware binaries via a remote web server. Each test run was either on a Windows 10 or Windows Server host,
never both at the same time.
When the download finished on each host, the PowerShell script launched each ransomware binary remotely, except
for Babuk. We were then able to analyze the speed that each variant encrypted files using Windows security event
logs. Event Code 4663 (an attempt was made to access an object) was required to capture the encryption events
reliably. We enabled file system auditing for the 100 test directories on the Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019
hosts in order to generate the required event logs.

The Ransomware Binaries
The 100 ransomware samples across 10- ransomware families were sourced from VirusTotal. We solely leveraged
Microsoft Defender detections from VirusTotal for ransomware family attribution. The ransomware families were
selected due to their prevalence over the past 12 to 24 months (fig. 4).

Figure 4. The 10 ransomware families and their respective strains were selected for our research.

The VirusTotal detection strings and SHA256 hashes of each binary tested in each family can be found in Appendix C.

Results
The answer to our initial question of how fast ransomware encrypts showed a large variance between ransomware
families. We wanted to understand the encryption speed and duration for each sample as well as the median
speed and duration across the families themselves. Using the median value as opposed to the average/mean value
prevented small numbers of outliers from skewing the overall results of a particular family.
As we collected Windows Perfmon data during our testing, we observed that some families utilized increased
system resources better than others. Some of the families were very efficient, while others tended to utilize large
percentages of CPU time along with very high disk access rates. There was no direct correlation between a sample
using a larger amount of system resources with a faster encryption speed. Some ransomware families performed
worse, or even crashed, when deployed on the faster test systems.
On a per sample basis, the fastest encryption time across the 98,561 test files observed was 4 minutes and 9 seconds.
This was performed by lockbit-9.exe (133adb408a4837d3a20634d79baf01151061c49cd936e9a8787b91df8997b6b0)
on a Windows 2019 Server high specification instance (fig. 5).

Figure 5. Data from the lockbit-9.exe sample deployed on a Windows 2019 server.

Conversely, the slowest encryption time observed for the same test file set was 3 hours, 35 minutes and 8 seconds.
This was performed by babuk-5.exe (1b9412ca5e9deb29aeaa37be05ae8d0a8a636c12fdff8c17032aa017f6075c02)
on a Windows 10 mid specification instance (fig. 6).

Figure 6. Data from the babuk-5.exe sample deployed on a Windows 10 instance.

When we look at the median encryption duration across each family tested we found that although a single sample of
Babuk was the slowest ransomware to encrypt, the Babuk family as a whole was the second fastest with a duration
of 6 minutes and 34 seconds. LockBit was still the fastest overall at 5 minutes and 50 seconds. The slowest median
encryption time per family was Mespinoza, (PYSA) with a median duration time of 1 hour, 54 minutes, and 54 seconds.
Overall, the median encryption duration across all ransomware families was 42 minutes and 52 seconds (fig. 7).

WHITE PAPER

The average median duration demonstrates a limited window of time to respond to a ransomware attack once the
encryption process is underway. This can prove even more limiting considering that the catastrophic apex may be
when a single critical file is encrypted, rather than the whole of the victim’s data. With such factors in play, it may
prove to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the majority of organizations to mitigate a ransomware attack
once the encryption process begins. While detection and defensive capabilities are beyond the scope of this
research, all is not lost for those looking to defend themselves against ransomware attacks.
We took care to ensure our methodology for capturing this data didn’t influence the outcome of the data we
collected. However, we were limited in our ability to measure the latency that these tools, such as Sysmon and
constrained Object Level Auditing, may have introduced. We don’t believe these tools caused any significant latency
that would drastically alter the findings in our research. Future research that focuses on ransomware encryption
speeds may wish to ensure that there is a means of measuring the latency that tooling may introduce. Finally, we
recognize that the attribution of ransomware samples to “families'' can be difficult. In order to ensure consistent
bias of sample selection for this research, we compared the hashes of each sample with Microsoft Defender results
obtained from VirusTotal. The signature name was extracted and then normalized. We then used the resulting
normalized value to identify the specific ransomware family.

Conclusions and Further Work
The goal of this research was to empirically evaluate the encryption speed of common ransomware families across a
variety of operating systems and hardware specifications in order to determine if organizations could realistically react
in time for effective mitigation. Based on our median results, our findings indicated a total loss of data via ransomware
encryption occurs in under 43 minutes. The encryption and loss of data is the “actions on objective” of the formerly
mentioned Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain. Forty-three minutes is an extremely limited window of opportunity for
mitigation, especially considering that the average time to detect compromise is three days, as the Mandiant M-Trends
report found. As a result, we postulate that it’s unlikely many organizations can prevent a total loss of data from
ransomware. If an organization wishes to defend against ransomware, it’s clear that they need to move left on the cyber
kill chain and detect on delivery or exploitation rather than actions on objective. We are hopeful that findings from this
research can help network defenders better explore and identify potential opportunities for mitigation. It should also
be noted that although we configured our lab to detect wormable behavior by the ransomware samples, the majority of
samples had no such behavior. Future research will explore worming behavior in further depth.
Our research does not stop with this work. We plan to release this corpus of information on the Splunk BOSS Platform
to enable additional areas of research that warrant exploration. More specifically, we hope to evaluate the patterns that
ransomware exhibits when encrypting files, ransomware worming behavior, how to cluster similar ransomware binaries
based on fuzzy hashing algorithms, and future analysis of ransomware family attribution over time.
