CVE-2015-2545 is a vulnerability discovered in 2015 and corrected
with Microsoft’s update MS15-099. The vulnerability affects Microsoft
Office versions 2007 SP3, 2010 SP2, 2013 SP1 and 2013 RT SP1.
The error enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a
specially crafted EPS image file. The exploit uses PostScript and can
evade Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data
Execution Prevention (DEP) protection methods.
The exploit was discovered in the wild in August 2015, when it was
used in a targeted attack by the Platinum group, presumably against
targets in India. Over the following months, there was significant
growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a
primary tool for initial penetration, with both the attack groups and
their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East.
In this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE2015-2545 vulnerability undertaken by some of these groups.

Overview of groups using CVE-2015-2545

Platinum (also known as TwoForOne)
The group is believe to originate from South-East Asia. Its attacks can
be traced as far back as 2009. The group is notable for exploiting 0-day
vulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly focused
targeted attacks – mostly against government agencies in Malaysia,
Indonesia, China and India.
This group was the first to exploit the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability.
After the vulnerability was corrected with Microsoft updates in
September and November 2015, no new Platinum attacks exploiting
this vulnerability have been detected.
Microsoft presented the activity of this group at the SAS conference in
February 2016, and in its paper: PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South
and Southeast Asia.

APT16

CVE-2015-2545: overview of current threats — securelist.com

The group has been known for several years and is believed to be of
Chinese origin. In November and December 2015, it used a modified
exploit for CVE-2015-2545 in attacks against information and news
agencies in Taiwan. These attacks were described in a FireEye
research paper – The EPS Awakens – Part 2.

EvilPost
In December 2015, Kaspersky Lab became aware of a targeted attack
against the Japanese defense sector. In order to infect victims, the
attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS
(Encapsulated Postscript) object. The EPS object contained a
shellcode that dropped and loaded a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file
depending on the system architecture. This, in turn exploited another
vulnerability to elevate privileges to Local System (CVE-2015-1701)
and download additional malware components from the C&C server.
The C&C server used in the attack was located in Japan and appears to
have been compromised. However, there is no indication that it has
ever been used for any other malicious purpose. Monitoring of the
server activity for a period of several months did not result in any new
findings. We believe the attackers either lost access to the server or
realized that it resulted in too much attention from security
researchers, as the attack was widely discussed by the Japanese
security community.
According to our research partner in Japan, the original EvilPost
attack in December 2015 arrived as a spear-phishing email with a
Word document attached.

This document embedded an EPS object file, which triggered a
vulnerability in the EPS format handler in Microsoft Word. Even with
an exploit component, Microsoft Word rendered the document
correctly and displayed the decoy message. The document is written in
good Japanese, as shown below.

It has been used to decoy New Year impressions of defense-related
organizations.
This attack was also described in the FireEye report, mentioned above.
An overview of the activity of the EvilPost group activity was provided
to subscribers of the Kaspersky Lab Threat Intelligence Service in
March 2016. For information about the service, please write to
intelreports@kaspersky.com.

SPIVY
In March and April 2016, a series of emails laced with an exploit
forCVE-2015-2545 were detected. The emails were sent in spearphishing attacks, presumably targeting organizations in Hong Kong.
Identifying a specific group behind these attacks is difficult because

https://www.readability.com/articles/xnt9jvry

4/50

5/25/2016

CVE-2015-2545: overview of current threats — securelist.com

they used a new variant of a widely available backdoor known as
PoisonIvy (from which the name of the group, SPIVY, is derived). A
description of these incidents can be found in the PaloAlto blog.

Danti and SVCMONDR
These two groups have not yet been publicly described. An overview of
their attacks and the tools used is provided in this report.

Danti attacks
Danti (Kaspersky Lab’s internal name) is an APT actor that has been
active at least since 2015, predominantly targeting Indian government
organizations. According to our telemetry, Danti has also been actively
hitting targets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar,
Nepal and the Philippines.

CVE-2015-2545: overview of current threats — securelist.com

The group implemented a new campaign in February and March 2016,
using a repurposed implementation of the CVE-2015-2545 exploit with
custom shellcode. In order to infect the victim, the attackers
distributed spear-phishing emails with an attached DOCX file
exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The
exploit is based on a malformed embedded EPS (Encapsulated
Postscript) object. This contains the shellcode that drops a backdoor,
providing full access to the attackers.
Main findings:
Danti, a previously unknown group, is probably related to
NetTraveller and DragonOK
In February-March 2016 the group was observed using CVE-20152545
It remains active, conducting attacks against Indian diplomatic
organizations
Related attacks have been observed against Central and South
East Asia targets
The campaign leveraging the exploit for CVE-2015-2545 took place in
February 2016. As a result, several emails with attached DOCX files
were uploaded to VirusTotal. The email recipients were connected to
the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, as can be seen below:
dsfsi@nic.in, the Foreign Service Institute, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (Under Secretary (FT/NRG), dsfsi@mea.gov.in)
chumarpost@gmail.com, possibly related to the Chumar military
post in India, a disputed area between India and China (the mail
server is the same as the Indian Ministry of Foreign AffairsvastuXX.nic.in)
chancery@indianembassy.hu, the Indian embassy in Hungary
amb.copenhagen@mea.gov.in, the Indian Embassy in Denmark

In the case of the Indian Embassy in Hungary, it looks like the original
message was forwarded from the embassy to the Indian IT security
team in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and uploaded later to Virus
Total.

Initial vector
The emails that were analysed had originally been sent via “3cappmailcom-lxa06.server.lan”, perhaps using a spam-mailer program. In
all known cases, the sender used the same gate at
74.208.4.200/74.208.4.201 (mout.gmx.com), a well-known open relay
SMTP server.
The email messages changed for different waves of the campaign.
When the campaign started in February 2nd, the emails carried the
subject headers “Mission List” and “HQ List”, and forged the identity
of a real sender.

HQ List decoy document
Both files (“Mission List” and “HQ list”) have different decoy content,
but both use the same CVE-2015-2545 EPS exploit (image1.eps, MD5
a90a329335fa0af64d8394b28e0f86c1).
Interestingly, as can be seen in their metadata, both files were
modified by the user “India” on 01.02.2016, just one day before they
were sent to targets.

The text of the document was copied from a Forbes article published
in 2007. According to its metadata, the document was created in June
2015, so it has probably been used before in unknown attacks.

CVE-2015-2545: overview of current threats — securelist.com

The attackers used at least one known 1-day exploit: the
exploitforCVE-2015-2545 – EPS parsing vulnerability in
EPSIMP32.FLT module, reported by FireEye, and patched by
Microsoft on 8 September 2015 with MS15-099.
We are currently aware of about four different variants of the exploit.
The original one was used in August 2015 against targets in India by
the Platinum (TwoForOne) APT group.

Original EPS exploit, used in August 2015
The second (which is a modified variant of the original exploit) was
used in EvilPost attacks against Japan in 2015, and then reused by
cybercriminals in March 2016. This variant was also used by the
APT16 group (ELMER backdoor) in Taiwan in December 2015. The
second variant is easily recognized by the specific strings in its EPS
shellcode:

The “h:\\test.txt” string could have been forgotten by the exploit
developer
The third variant was used in December 2015 against a Taiwanese
organization, and in February 2016 against an Indian diplomatic
organization. This variant uses different shellcode but is based on the
original exploit from the Platinum (TwoForOne) APT:

https://www.readability.com/articles/xnt9jvry

17/50

5/25/2016

CVE-2015-2545: overview of current threats — securelist.com

Can be recognized by “add2 <eb135” substring
In the third variant, the binaries with the encrypted malicious exe file
and the decoy document can be found at the end of the files.
In the third variant, the binary starts with “PdPD” (50 64 50 44), a
marker previously used for encrypted binaries by a number of APT
groups (Anchor Panda, Samurai Panda, Temper Panda).

Encrypted data at the end of the eps file
The decryption function is 1-byte XOR with a key from “\x00” to “\xff”
and replacement of the Odd byte for an Even byte in several hundred
bytes from the header.

March attack
At the end of March 2016, we discovered a new wave of attacks by the
Danti group against Indian governmental institutions. On March 28th
several malicious document were sent to various recipients at the
Cabinet Secretariat of Government India from the email account of

Email header
The attachment contains the file “Holidays in India in 2016.docx” with
the embedded EPS exploit. This time the attackers used the second
variant of the exploit (previously used by the EvilPost and APT16
groups), with minor changes:
They removed the part with the “h:\\test.txt” strings
Dropped the binary added at the end of the EPS object (the same as
in the third variant of the exploit)
Instead of using the “PdPD” string as a marker for binary, they used a
new identifier: “1111111122222222”

The dropper installs four files in the system. The “Appinfo.dat” file
launches “PotPlayerMini.exe”, monitors the memory periodically with
the GlobalMemoryStatus API function and writes the results to
“C:\windows\memstatus.txt”
The main loader “PotPlayerMini.exe” is a legitimate multimedia player
from Daum Communication. The file is signed with a legitimate

“D:\BaiduYunDownload\ServiceExe\Release\ServiceExe.pdb”), which
is a Yoda-compressed binary. The backdoor code is stored inside
update.dat.
The potplayer.dll “PreprocessCmdLineEx” export function:
Creates a service named “MemoryStatus” with a path to
“appinfo.dat” file and sets it to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\
Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run with the
name “potplayer”.
Opens “update.dat” file, decrypts it with xor operations and passes
the execution to the result buffer.
“update.dat”, a backdoor:
Makes its first GET request to hardcoded CnC
“newsupdate.dynssl.com/index.html” in order to get the new CnC in
the response.
If 407 response code is returned (Proxy authentication required) then
the sample sends the request again with “proxyname” string as the
proxy username and “proxypass” string as the proxy password. That
suggests that may be the sample is compiled using some builder where
these parameters must be set manually and in this specific sample
were not changed from default.
Finds “8FC628C9F43D42E2B77C2801518AF2A5” substring and
decrypts it using AES CTR mode thrice using three 16-bytes keys.
Makes a POST request to the new CnC with “im=validate” URL
parameter and expects “success” string as the response.

SVCMONDR: the Taiwan case
In December 2015, we uncovered another example of the type of
shellcode found in the exploit for CVE-2015-2545. On 11 December, a
spear-phishing email was sent by attackers to an employee of a
Taiwanese security software reseller.

This resemblance could mean that we can attribute this case to the
Danti group. However, it could also be a coincidence or yet another
case of different groups using the same malicious code. That’s why we
are noting this incident separately from the Danti group’s activity.
Interestingly, in the first few days of December, another group –
APT16 (FireEye’s classification) also targeted Taiwan-based
organizations with a CVE-2015-2545 EPS exploit, and its emails
originated from the same domain as the one sent by the SVCMONDR
attackers. However, it used another type of shellcode and a different
backdoor – ELMER.

CVE-2015-2545: overview of current threats — securelist.com

All results sent to the CnC after processing commands are encrypted
with RC4 with a MAC-address as a key.
The CnC points to an IP address in Hong Kong. This IP address belongs
to a local private company, but falls within a range of IP addresses that
belong to another enterprise that has already been identified as a host
location for command and control servers that communicate with
malware.
The CnC has been used in other APT incidents, attributed by FireEye
to the group “admin@338” aka “Temper Panda” (59.188.0.197,
accounts.serveftp.com).
In general, this IP address space from “New World Telecom HK” is one
of the favorite places used by different Chinese-origin APT groups to
host command & control servers/proxies.
Another detail suggesting a possible relationship between
SVCMONDR and Temper Panda is the use of the “PdPD” (50 64 50 44)
marker for encrypted binaries. According to Crowdstrike, the same
marker has been used previously by a number of APT groups (Anchor
Panda, Samurai Panda and Temper Panda).
The latest known activity of “admin@338” was in August 2015, when it
was used to target Hong Kong-based media using its own tools,
LOWBALL and BUBBLEWRAP.
However, we are unable to draw any conclusion regarding the

According to KSN data, in addition to Taiwan, there are some
SVCMONDR victims in Thailand.

Conclusions
We are currently aware of at least four different APT actors actively
using exploits of the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability: TwoForOne (also
known as Platinum), EvilPost, APT16 and Danti.
These groups have their own toolsets of malicious program. Danti’s
arsenal is more extensive than those of EvilPost and APT16, and in
terms of functionality can be compared with Platinum. All groups are
focused on targets in the Asian region and have never been seen in
incidents in Western Europe or the USA.
The TwoForOne (Platinum) group is described in Microsoft research,
APT16 in FireEye reports, and EvilPost and Danti in Kaspersky Lab
private reports.
Danti is highly focused on diplomatic entities. It may already have full
access to internal networks in Indian government structures.
According to Kaspersky Security Network, some Danti Trojans have
also been detected in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar,
Nepal and the Philippines.
Despite the fact that Danti uses a 1-day exploit, the group is able to
make its own modifications to bypass current antivirus detections. A
number of the modules used by Danti have the same functionality as
previously known and used malicious programs like NetTraveller and
DragonOK.
The use of CVE-2015-2545 exploits is on the rise. In addition to the
groups mentioned above, we have seen numerous examples of these
exploits being used by traditional cybercriminals in mass mailings in
February-April 2016. Such attacks mostly target financial institutions

in Asia. Specifically, attacks have been recorded in Vietnam, the
Philippines and Malaysia. There are reasons to believe that Nigerian
cybercriminals are behind these attacks. In some cases, the
infrastructure used is the same as the one we saw when analyzing the
Adwind Trojan.
We expect to see more incidents with this exploit and we continue to
monitor new waves of attacks and the potential relationship with
other attacks in the region.
To know more about how to address the issue of known
vulnerabilities most properly, read this post in the Kaspersky
Business Blog.
