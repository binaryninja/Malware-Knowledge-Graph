The Teabot (aka ‘Anatsa’) is a new Android Banking Trojan with an array of malicious
features that aid in the tracking of a victim’s financial activities and spreading to more
victims. It is reported to have been first noticed at the beginning of this year, purportedly
targeting a handful of European banks and few languages. Some of the malicious features
include Key logging, Disabling Google Play Protect, Overlay attack and controlling the
SMS.
The main infection vector of Teabot, used by the threat actors is Smishing campaigns,
where the victims are persuaded to download and install the distributed malicious
application. Teabot masquerades as media, postal and logistics service apps like
BookReader, PlutoTV, TeaTV, VLC Media Player, Correos, DHL and UPS.

In this blog, we will be analyzing a sample “Snake.Sound.Mouse” which masquerades as a
VLC media player as shown in Figure 2.

Once Teabot malware is installed on the device, it frequently brings up the Accessibility
Service setting option on the device, as shown in Figure 3, until the user allows this app to
have the Accessibility Service enabled. This app stays stealth by hiding its icon from the
application drawer after its first launch. Also, threat actors here use
MediaProjectionManager API to obtain a live streaming of the device screen on-demand
and also interact with it via Accessibility Services.

Analyzing the Payload
Once the permissions are granted, this malicious apk decrypts the malicious payload file
called kbu.json from the app’s assets folder to an executable dex format named
‘kbu.odex’ and loads the decrypted file as shown in Figure 4.

Teabot is currently targeting 6 different languages “Spanish, English, German, Italian,
Dutch and French” as shown in Figure 5.

The Trojan attempts to intercept SMS messages and aborts the new SMSReceived
broadcast to the victim; as per the bot command “logged_sms” as shown in Figure 6.

Abusing the Android Accessibility Service, this Trojan acts as a keylogger to steal all the
victim’s information on the device.

C2 Communication
Teabot enumerates all the installed applications on the victim’s device and then sends the
list of installed apps from the victim’s device to the C2 server during its first
communication. All the communications between C2 and the malware remain encrypted
using an XOR key as shown in Figure 8. When one or more targeted apps are found, the
malware C2 sends the specific payload(s) to the victim device to perform an overlay attack
and track all the activity related to the identified targeted application(s).

This malware also terminates the predefined list of apps process(es), as shown in Figure
10 and Figure 11. Interestingly, that list includes a few popular security products as
highlighted below, in order to remain undetected.
