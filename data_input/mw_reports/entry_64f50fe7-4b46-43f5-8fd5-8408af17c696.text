Community Identifiers
Cobalt Group, Cobalt Gang

Cobalt Spider is a financially-motivated criminal group, active since
2016, responsible for campaigns against financial institutions across
a variety of regions. While COBALT SPIDER initially targeted Russia
and the CIS, since 2019, campaigns have focussed on targeting
financial institutions in Europe, the Middle East, and Central and
South America.
The adversary conducts spear phishing campaigns that frequently impersonate financial
institutions to deliver a variety of malware. COBALT SPIDER has likely monetized access to
financial institutions by conducting ATM cash-outs.
