INTRODUCTION
  This report provides information on the results of analysis regarding
Daserf (a type of malware that is used in targeted attacks aimed at
critical infrastructure providers in Japan) and the attackers using it.
  Japan has seen an increase in targeted attacks that use
sophisticated methods to relentlessly attack the companies targeted.
Especially, in June 2015, the Japan Pension Service sustained a
targeted attack, resulting in the leakage of a huge amount of personal
information. Thereafter, similar attacks against many organizations
and companies in Japan, including local governments and universities,
have been exposed, and the term "targeted attack" became widely
known to the public. At the time of writing (June 2016), a large travel
agency had sustained damage due to a targeted attack, announcing
that it was very possible that personal information was leaked. The
methods used in these targeted attacks have become more and
more sophisticated. Thus, there is not just the risk that information is
stolen from the company—there is also the serious risk of increased
repercussions affecting business continuity.
  NISCi has reported that the number of attacks against critical
infrastructure providers, including those related to information
communication, finance, aviation, and electric power, has increased
significantly from 124 in FY2014 to 401 in FY2015. As the Tokyo
Olympics and Paralympics are scheduled for 2020, it is more likely
that attacks against critical infrastructure providers and infrastructurerelated companies will further increase. Under these circumstances,
through this report, more or less, we hope to contribute to the
consideration of countermeasures against Daserf attacks.

Daserf: What is it and how is it being
used in targeted attacks?
Daserf is a type of malware that features a backdoor which is also known as a "Nioupale."
Although Symantec made a report on Daserf in May 2016 in its blog,ii until then, Daserf was
not widely known, as it had rarely been reported by security vendors. On the other hand, we
confirmed the presence of Daserf in targeted attack incidents from around January 2013, and
we have been continuing to analyze those incidents. Our analysis has revealed that Daserf
was being used by attackers targeting critical infrastructure in Japan and that there is a high
possibility that Daserf has been active while hiding in target organizations for a long period of
time.
Figure 1 shows a graph that classifies the industries where Daserf was used in LAC-handled
incidents. The right frame indicates critical infrastructure-related industries,iii accounting for
the majority, at 56%. The left frame indicates the manufacturers of equipment used in critical
infrastructure, and the graph shows that all the incidents are directly or indirectly related to
critical infrastructure. Furthermore, this shows a high possibility that, at least in Japan, attackers
have used Daserf to target critical infrastructure and their related companies.

Figure 2 shows a timeline of Daserf-related incidents. In the timeline, the upper figure (in black)
indicates a date (year and month) that an incident was handled, and the lower figure (in red)
indicates a date (year and month) when the malware was compiled or when the starting time of
the malware activities was recorded in the communications log. That is, the figure at the bottom
indicates an estimated date when the intrusion occurred. By comparing these two rows of dates,
it shows that it took a much longer time, from several months to approximately two and a half
years, for the targeted companies to identify any damage caused by the Daserf.

The reason why it took a longer time to identify any damage is because Daserf disguised itself
(via a file name) as an official Windows program (such as msupdata.exe or mshelp.exe) or as an
Adobe product program (such as AdobeARM.exe or reader_sl.exe). It is difficult to distinguish such
programs running on a PC from illegitimate programs. For all the incidents detected, we found
RAR compressed files1 containing confidential information, and attackers seemed to attempt to
steal confidential information from companies before any attacks are revealed.

Daserf: Operating environment and overview
Daserf runs on the Windows OS. As it features a variety of functions, such as file operations
(creation, deletion, search, etc.) and command prompt (cmd.exe) operation, it can perform any
operation on the infected PC. These capabilities are represented by file names (xxxxx.asp) hardcoded into the malware, and the operation performed depends on the instructions from the
attacker’s Command & Control (C2) server.

03

Figure 3 File names hard-coded into malware

Characteristics of Daserf traffic
Daserf mainly uses the HTTP POST request for communication with the C2 server, and it also
uses an HTTP GET request to establish a session. The procedure, from establishing a session
to starting communication, is as follows. First, Daserf uses an HTTP GET request to download a
GIF file from the C2 server (Figure 4). In reality, this GIF file does not contain any image that the
extension implies. Instead, it contains an XOR-encoded (exclusive OR) URL2 using one byte.

04

The XOR key depends on the type of malware used.

Then, it sends data to the C2 server by combining the URL with a file name hard-coded into the
malware (Figure 5).

Figure 6 shows the first HTTP POST traffic that occurs after the HTTP GET request in Figure
4. The sent data contains the ID of the infected PC and the Base64-encoded infected PC
information (boxed text). By decoding the sent data, we can see that the character string includes
specific information, such as the host name and the IP address of the infected PC (Figure 7). The
character string contains an OS version of 6.1, which indicates Windows 7, and a locale ID of
1041, which indicates use of the Japanese language.

As LAC investigates several Daserf incidents, a special feature has emerged. Figure 8 (next
page) represents an excerpt from the results of Maltegoiv-based analysis by identifying the IP
addresses of the Daserf traffic destination based on the domain names. It shows that multiple
arrows are directed toward two ellipses.3 Both of the ellipses indicate an IP addresses managed
by South Korean carriers. The left one is managed by LG DACOM Corporation, and the right
one is managed by Korea Telecom. As far as LAC has confirmed, approximately 65% of the IP
addresses of C2 servers that Daserf communicates with, including this case, are owned by South
Korean companies. Based on this, there is a high possibility that the attackers using Daserf
utilized South Korean Internet service providers as their C2 server infrastructure. In addition, it
has been confirmed that there were a few IP addresses involving Japanese VPS (virtual private
server) service providers that were also used as C2 servers.

3

The IP addresses identified at the time of the investigation may be different from the IP addresses being used
currently.

08

Figure 8 Daserf traffic destinations (IP addresses)

In addition, it was confirmed that there is a possibility that some of the C2 servers are likely
to have been designed to return contents only to users with the IP addresses that are being
targeted. As shown in Figure 9, a LAC PC intentionally infected with Daserf could resolve the C2
server domain name into an IP address, but it could not establish a TCP connection with the C2
server via C2 traffic (HTTP GET request). The attacker might have denied a connection request
from any non-target IP address on the C2 server to prevent contents from being downloaded so
that the C2 server was not easily recognized.

09

Figure 9 C2 server name resolution

Detecting Daserf
A PC or server infected with Daserf can be relatively easily identified. Daserf generates HTTP
POST traffic to a specific ASP file on the C2 server approximately once every 10 seconds, in
order to establish a connection with a C2 server.4 This results in a large amount of POST traffic
being generated from the same PC and being recorded in the proxy log, thus the infected PC,
etc., can be easily identified by periodically checking the proxy log for such traffic.

8

A user agent assigned to the HTTP header for communication is hard-coded into the malware,
and a recent Daserf version uses "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)."5 It
appears to be an official user agent for Internet Explorer (IE) 8, but if closely examined, it does not
have a character string of "Trident 4" assigned to it when IE8 is used.v Checking the proxy log for
the presence of such a user agent is another effective method.
If a PC that generates traffic to the C2 server is successfully identified, traces of Daserf could
possibly be detected by using the following means; that is, to use Autoruns6 etc., in order to
check the registry values for startups7 and the services8 automatically executed upon Windows
startup. Figure 10 shows that Daserf uses a file name of Adobe ARM to execute AdobeARM.exe
upon startup.

Daserf: Who uses it?
The iDefence Research Report (Wicked Rose and the NCPH Hacking Group)vi of 2007 from
VeriSign iDefense is only one of very few reports on Daserf. The report identifies Daserf (Daserf. A)
as one of the malware types used in a targeted attack in June 2006 by a Chinese hacking group
known as the "Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH) Hacking Group," and the report suggests
that the hacking group is involved in creating Daserf.
Some of our investigations also revealed a vague image of who is attacking. Figure 11 shows
an official website of an overseas trading company that handles LED products, and it was used
as a C2 server by an attacker using Daserf. The displayed list of files in a CSS directory at the
website contains CSS files as well as PHP files. The attacker was able to somehow penetrate into
the trading company's Web server and install one or more files that the server administrator did
not intend to install.

11

Figure 11 List of files in the mentioned CSS directory

Our investigation showed that the feedcom.php file in the CSS directory was actually an
encrypted file, not a PHP file. In addition, decoding the encrypted file revealed that it was an
executable file, as shown in Figure 12.

The executable file that was decoded from the PHP file was not a malicious program such as
a malware, it was simply Notepad, which is included as standard (5.1.2600.5512 (xpsp.0804132105)) in the Chinese version of Windows OS (Figure 13). We don't know the reason why the
attacker put the encrypted Notepad on the C2 server.
It should be noted that the comment.php file in the same CSS directory was likely to have been
used as some type of an access log, as it recorded dates and times, IP addresses, and user agents.

13
Figure 13 Chinese version of Notepad
Next, let’s look at an overview of the attacker based on suspicious traffic that has been
infected with malware, including Daserf and Daserf-related malware. Figure 14 shows a summary
of the unauthorized communication in chronological order between September 15 and October
16, 2015. Of the two rows of arrows, the upper row indicates Japanese holidays, and the lower
row indicates Chinese holidays. The graph shows that an almost constant and small amount of
traffic occurred between September 28 and October 9, 2015. The period corresponds to the
2015 National Day of the People's Republic of China (October 1 to October 7), and the attacker
might have taken days off during that period, following Chinese culture and customs. We assume
the constant and small amount of traffic was caused by some beacon traffic generated by the
malware even though the infected PC was not controlled by the attacker during that period.

the middle of September and the middle of October 2015
Up to here, we have focused on how the trends in traffic infected with Daserf-type malware
have changed over time. Next, look at how such infected traffic changed, depending on the
hour of day. Figure 15 (next page) shows a graph indicating how the amount of traffic changed,
depending on the hour of day, 9 between September 15 and October 16, 2015. The amount
of traffic was remarkably higher during the hours between 9:00 and 17:00 (enclosed in lines),
and the attacker is likely to have been operating the infected PC during that period. The hours
enclosed in lines are from 8:00 to 16:00, China Standard Time, and this almost corresponds to
work hours for general workers in China.
For the hours during which the attacker was active, the attacker might have adapted to
Japanese work hours. However, considering that days with a very small amount of traffic
correspond to Chinese holidays, the attacker is likely to have been following the local schedule.

In addition, as will be mentioned in a later section, "Types of malware used by attackers," some
malware types used by attackers for a series of attacks are encrypted with a tool released
via a Chinese site. Although this is only speculative, we can say that such an accumulation of
fragmentary evidence provides a glimpse of who is attacking with Daserf.

Daserf: Modus operandi of attackers
In a targeted attack, the attacker uses various attack methods to penetrate a target
organization. An attacker sends an e-mail attaching Daserf disguised as a seasonal greeting to a
target and tricks the recipient to open the e-mail, thus causing an infection with malware. If the
e-mail recipient opens the attached file, a Flash animation as shown in Figure 16 will appear, and
behind the scenes, the malware (downloader type) will be executed.
Some of our investigations have revealed that the files attached to the e-mails are most
commonly a .zip file, which is uncompressed into an .exe file. The .exe file is disguised as a Flash
icon file for a New Year greeting, named " 新年アニメーション .exe" (Figure 17 on the next page).
If the file is executed, a Flash animation will appear, and behind the scenes, Daserf or another
different type of malware will be downloaded from a C2 server and executed (Figure 18, CASE A,
on the next page).
For all cases, the e-mail body text is unknown.
Largely, the downloader was compiled in late December. It is possible that the attackers sent
targeted e-mails, taking advantage of events like Christmas or New Years.

CVE-2015-2545

Figure 18 Infection route with a targeted e-mail

Malware infection is not limited to the method of sending a .zip file with a compressed .exe to
targeted users. We consider it likely that attackers also use a method of exploiting CVE-20152545, a Microsoft Office vulnerability (Figure 18, CASE B). This is because Gofarer, which
Symantec Corporation reported as a type of malware for downloading Daserf, is similar to the
type of malware (downloader) dropped after exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. Figure
19 shows the results of comparison between Gofarer and the code that creates a Mutex of
the dropped malware type. The Mutex naming conventions are similar. In addition, each type of
malware uses code to obtain access to the startup folder via the SHGetSpecialFolderPathAviii
Windows API for obtaining a special folder path, and creates malware in the startup folder, as
shown in Figure 20 (next page). Therefore, these two different downloaders seem to have likely
been used by the same attackers.

Kaspersky Labix reported that the attacking code exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability
was used by more than one attacker. As reported by FireEye,x also in Japan, an Office document
file exploiting the vulnerability was confirmed at the end of November 2015. LAC also confirmed
that an organization of a specific industry received a copy of the same Office document file at the
same time, and most likely, it’s a targeted attack against a specific industry.

Types of malware used by attackers
An attacker using Daserf uses more than one type of malware, downloader, or hacking tool for
command control. DATPER, xi which is a type of malware for command control, uses an HTTP
GET request for communication with a C2 server. Command execution results and information
about infected PCs are encrypted, and then the data is sent as a query string to the C2 server
(Figure 21).

21
Figure 21 HTTP GET request from DATPER

DATPER encodes the data to be sent with XOR encoding and custom Base64 encoding, and
then compresses the data via the RtlCompressBufferxii Windows API used for data compression.
The XOR encoding uses a key10 based on data (enclosed in lines in the figure), as shown in
Figure 22, and the custom Base64 encoding uses the Base64 conversion table shown in Figure
23. Depending on the type of malware, the data to be sent may only be encoded with XOR
encoding and custom Base64 encoding, without being compressed with RtlCompressBuffer.

22

This may vary, depending on the type of malware.

Figure 24 shows the result of decoding a portion of the character string as shown enclosed in
lines in Figure 21. The VMPC-123 that appears in the portion enclosed in lines within the figure
indicates the host name of an infected PC.

Figure 24 Result of decoding the sent data

For downloaders, in addition to Gofarer, a VB script-based malware type has also been
confirmed. This malware type is encrypted as shown in Figure 25, with an encryption tool
released at a sitexiii in China. Figure 26 on the next page shows part of the result of decoding
the VB script, and it indicates that an Internet Explorer object is used to generate traffic.

For hacking tools, in addition to a publicly available tools such as mimikatz and gsecdump, there
is also the possibility of upload or tunnel tools being independently created by the attacker.
Such an upload tool, as per our confirmation, searches the current directory for files with the
.rar extension. The upload tool uploads a found .rar file to a URL (www.lac.co.jp, in this example)
specified for an argument (Figure 27).

27
Figure 27 Execution of upload tools independently created by an attacker

The upload tool uses HTTP POST traffic to upload data to www.lac.co.jp (Figure 28). The sent
data consists of "file name###file contents" and is encoded with both XOR encoding and custom
Base64 encoding. The decoded data is "lac.rar###lac". The attacker is likely to have used Daserf
in combination with their own tool and to have sent an RAR file containing stolen confidential
information to a C2 server managed by the attacker.

Conclusion
As described above, an attacker using Daserf uses multiple malware types including Daserf itself
and can continue to be active while hiding for a long period of time, in order to steal confidential
information from a target organization. As far as we can guess, based on Daserf incidents
handled by LAC, attackers have launched attacks against critical infrastructure at least once a
year, and will not stop attacking in the future. We hope that this report helps our customers to
consider future countermeasures under these circumstances.
You can identify the scope of damage and leaked data caused by Daserf. We recommend that
you make daily records of the logs of proxy server traffic and DNS server trafficxiv, etc., as these
are needed to analyze the malware type for which a trace can be identified in incident handling
and to decode the traffic encrypted by the malware type being used. In addition, traffic packets
should also be logged via a switching hub or router port mirroring, although there are disk space
and system load concerns.
LAC will continue to investigate the attackers behind Daserf and will widely share helpful
information with our customers.
