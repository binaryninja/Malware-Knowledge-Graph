Indicators Associated with Netwalker Ransomware
Summary
As of June 2020, the FBI has received notifications of Netwalker ransomware
attacks on U.S. and foreign government organizations, education entities, private
companies, and health agencies by unidentified cyber actors. Netwalker became
widely recognized in March 2020, after intrusions on an Australian transportation
and logistics company and a U.S. public health organization. Cyber actors using
Netwalker have since taken advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to compromise
an increasing number of unsuspecting victims.

Technical Details
Following a successful intrusion, Netwalker encrypts all connected Windows-based
devices and data, rendering critical files, databases, and applications inaccessible
to users. When executed, Netwalker deploys an embedded configuration that
includes a ransom note, ransom note file names, and various configuration
options.
In March 2020, actors using Netwalker began exploiting COVID-19 fears by luring
unsuspecting victims with pandemic related phishing e-mails. Specifically,
Netwalker spread through a Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) script attached to COVID19 phishing e-mails that executed the payload once opened.
In April 2020, actors using Netwalker began gaining unauthorized access to victim
networks by exploiting unpatched Virtual Private Network (VPN) appliances,
vulnerable user interface components in web applications, or weak passwords
used for Remote Desktop Protocol connections.

TLP:WHITE

Two of the most common vulnerabilities exploited by actors using Netwalker are Pulse Secure VPN (CVE-201911510) and Telerik UI (CVE-2019-18935). Once an actor has infiltrated a network with Netwalker, a combination of
malicious programs may be executed to harvest administrator credentials, steal valuable data, and encrypt user
files. In order to encrypt the user files on a victim network, the actors typically launch a malicious PowerShell script
embedded with the Netwalker ransomware executable.
Actors using Netwalker have previously uploaded stolen data to the cloud storage and file sharing service,
MEGA.NZ (MEGA), by uploading the data through the MEGA website or by installing the MEGA client application
directly on a victim’s computer. In June 2020, actors transitioned from uploading and releasing stolen data on
MEGA to uploading the stolen data to another file sharing service: website.dropmefiles.com.

Information Requested
The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to
target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,
and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.
However, the FBI understands that when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate
all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your
organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field
office or the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Doing so provides investigators with the critical
information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. law, and prevent future
attacks.
