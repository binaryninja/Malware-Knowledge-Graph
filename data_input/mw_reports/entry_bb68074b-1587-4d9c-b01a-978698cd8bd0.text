Application Security

Introduction
On 2 March 2021, Microsoft and Veloxity produced disclosures outlining the discovery of
four zero day vulnerabilities affecting multiple versions of Microsoft Exchange Server. Each
of the vulnerabilities have been attributed a severity rating from high to critical, however the
most impactful statement from both Microsoft and Veloxity was that these vulnerabilities
formed an attack chain which was being actively exploited in the wild.
Since the publication of these disclosures, details have emerged regarding the observed
source of the exploitation of these vulnerabilities. The attacks are being widely attributed to
the state-sponsored group dubbed Hafnium, alleged to be operating out of China.
The most notable of the new CVEs, CVE-2021-26855, is a SSRF vulnerability in Microsoft
Exchange which allows an attacker to induce the server into performing “unintended
actions” through the use of a series of specially crafted POST requests. The attacker can
leverage this vulnerability to exploit the other CVEs to perform malicious actions, such as
dump private email, or even achieve remote code execution.

Imperva has put dedicated security rules in place to protect our customers in a direct
response to the initial disclosures. Imperva has also performed analysis on the attempted
exploitation of these CVEs and we have produced the following insights.

Observations and Statistics
Since the 2 March disclosures, Imperva has observed over 44k scanning and exploitation
attempt sessions in the wild from over 1,600 unique source IPs, related to the Microsoft
Exchange CVE-2021-26855 SSRF. From this data, we have been able to identify the most
targeted industries and countries which have been affected by the vulnerability in the
aftermath of the disclosures.

Targeted Industries
One of the key observations we have made is that this vulnerability has impacted almost
every category of industry, this observation is explained by how ubiquitous the use of
Microsoft Exchange is across all sectors. According to our data, the Computing & IT sector
was the most targeted industry, with 21% of all targeted sites belonging to this category.
Next was Financial Services with 18%, and Telecoms and ISPs completed the top 3 with
10.5%. Below we show the breakdown of scanning and exploitation attempts against
various industries.

Targeted Countries
Imperva observed both scanning and exploitation attempts against sites worldwide, with the
US being the most targeted country, with the UK and Singapore a distant second and third,
respectively.

Source Countries
Imperva observed that since the disclosures, relatively few scanning and exploitation
attempts have been made from Chinese sources. This could be because exploitation, and
to a greater extent, scanning has shifted to the wider public. It may also be because the
attackers are using proxies to carry out the attacks. The chart below shows the top
attacking countries by session count observed by Imperva analysts since the disclosures.

Attacker IP Reputation

3/7

Imperva’s IP reputation allows for the identification of potentially suspicious or malicious
behaviour by means of tagging relevant IPs. From this data, 42.3% of the attacker source
IPs were previously tagged by Imperva as having exhibited malicious behaviour and 8.45%
of the attacker source IPs were previously tagged by Imperva as being identified as
vulnerability scanners.

Observed Attacker Activity
Imperva analysts have observed various indicators of the attempted exploitation of the
Microsoft Exchange Hafnium CVE-2021-26855 in the wild, indicating various motives on the
part of the attackers. As mentioned previously, an attacker can leverage the vulnerability to
perform various unauthorized actions, including the collection of private information, and
even the writing of arbitrary files to the server resulting in remote code execution. In this
section, we will discuss some of the requests we have observed and the perceived
intentions and motivation of the attackers.
Detailed descriptions of how the exploit chain works, and how it can be exploited are
available at various different sources [1][2], however the important thing to understand is
that the vulnerability allows an attacker to send malicious requests to various backend
components in Microsoft Exchange by means of a specially crafted POST request to either
the Outlook Web Application or the Exchange Admin Centre, where the “X-BEResource”
and “X-AnonResource-Backend” cookie values can be manipulated to specify the targeted
resource. In our investigation following the disclosures we have observed the following in
our data.

Crafted requests to /EWS/Exchange.asmx
A common exploit request observed by Imperva attempting to exploit the CVE-2021-26855
SSRF vulnerability was a POST request to Exchange Admin Centre (/ecp/) and Outlook
Web Application endpoints (/owa/) endpoint, with the crafted cookie value endpoints set to
the Exchange Web Services endpoint “/EWS/Exchange.asmx”. This allows the attacker to
gain authenticated access to private mail on the server. This request accounted for 18% of
exploitation attempts observed.

4/7

Crafted requests to /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml
The most common exploitation attempt of the SSRF observed by Imperva analysts were
requests to the Exchange Admin Centre endpoint (/ecp), with the vulnerabile cookie set with
the FQDN of the server, and the endpoint of /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml.
Autodiscover in Exchange is a service which allows for the rapid collection of Exchange
configurations, service URLs and supported protocols, therefore it makes an obvious target
for attackers who are attempting to quickly gather information, escalate privileges and
maintain persistence. In the case of this vulnerability the autodiscover service could be
used to gather the information required for further exploitation of the other CVEs associated
with the chain. This request accounted for 51% of exploitation attempts observed.

5/7

Crafted requests to /mapi/emsmdb
Another pattern Imperva analysts observed were crafted POST requests to the Exchange
Admin Centre (/ecp), with the cookie value crafted with the /mapi/emsmdb endpoint.
Research into the published exploits and disclosures indicate that the “/mapi/emsmdb”
endpoint can be abused to procure a valid SID, which can then allow the attacker to gain
privileges to the Exchange “proxyLogin.ecp” endpoint (Exchange HTTP proxy), which can
in turn be used to obtain a valid “ASP.NET_SessionID” and “msExchEcpCanary” values
which are required for further chained exploitation of MS exchange. This request accounted
for 3% of exploitation attempts observed.

How Imperva protects you
Imperva has implemented rules in Cloud WAF and On Prem WAF, which are effective
against all exploitation of CVE-2021-26855. These rules are also effective against the
chained exploitation of the subsequent CVEs: CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858 and
CVE-2021-27065.

Check if you have been compromised
Since the disclosures of these zero day vulnerabilities, various news articles have been
published reporting mass exploitation [1][2]. We recommend that if you have unpatched
exchange servers in your organization, you apply the latest patches from Microsoft as soon
as possible, and use the following guide from Microsoft to check for any indicators of
compromise.
