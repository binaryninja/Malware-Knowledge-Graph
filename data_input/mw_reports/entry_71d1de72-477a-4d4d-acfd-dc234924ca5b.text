THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | FOREWORD

Foreword
The 2014 report on the state of IT security discusses the quality and quantity of the threats
and risks facing information technology (IT) in
Germany. The report draws on the comprehensive
information about IT threats, attack vectors and
vulnerabilities, as well as specific IT attacks, which
is collected and evaluated every day by the Federal
Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für
Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – BSI).
The threat situation to which IT is currently
exposed remains critical given the attack potential
reported below. The most widely used IT systems
contain large numbers of vulnerabilities, and the
existing tools for exploiting these vulnerabilities
are available to ever more attackers, who are only
too willing to use them for their own purposes
under the cloak of anonymity provided by global
cyberspace. These attacks have many different
motives. Their targets include ordinary citizens,
government bodies, research institutes, business
enterprises and also the operators of critical infrastructure in Germany.
Unquestionably globalisation, driven forward at
an ever increasing rate by information technology, has exacerbated competition for resources,
markets and political influence. It would be naïve
to assume that newly created digitally interconnected technologies will not also be exploited in
the furtherance of disputes in economic, social
and political arenas. Indeed, it can be seen that
businesses and administrative bodies are increasingly falling victim to highly skilled IT attacks
which are executed with great professionalism
and can draw on ample resources. Such attacks
are usually hard to detect and defend against.
Frequently a worrying time window opens up
between attack and detection thereof, during
which the successful attacker enjoys unhindered,
unobserved access to the IT systems concerned.
Information technology innovation proceeds at
a breakneck pace. Due to the enormous economic
potential involved, this innovation drives correspondingly rapid changes in the IT landscape in
every industrial sector and social sphere. Cloud
computing, mobile systems and the opportunity
to evaluate information using Big Data fuel eco-

nomic growth, while on the other hand opening
up new vulnerabilities to IT attacks which cannot
be adequately addressed using conventional IT
security tools. Accordingly, IT innovation must
go hand in hand with the evolution of security
mechanisms designed to ensure that defenders
succeed in keeping pace with the technology
employed by their attackers.
Successful IT security demands independent
initiative and skill. The activities of foreign intelligence agencies uncovered in 2013, as well as
millions or even billions of cases of identity theft,
have led to a crisis of confidence in the Internet.
Although awareness of this issue has increased
greatly, both private and professional users ever
more frequently feel powerless against these
seemingly overwhelming threats. This sometimes
leads to a mood of resignation and failure to make
full use of the effective security measures which
are available and which do afford an impressive
level of protection against up to 95 per cent of all
attacks. As a result, potentials remain untapped,
thus unnecessarily exacerbating the IT security
situation.
This threatens to create a vicious circle of selffulfilling negative prophesies which needs to be
broken. The standardisation, certification and
transparency of key functions are vital to restoring and building up users’ confidence in IT security. Germany has a broad, highly skilled technological base in this respect, with an IT security
industry dominated by SMEs. The challenge is to
effectively exploit this favourable situation to the
benefit of the German economy in the face of the
impending digitalisation of every aspect of our
everyday and business lives and to create a positive climate for IT security measures. IT security
may come at a price but it is bound also to be
rewarded in the marketplace.
What I would like to see is for business and government to redouble their efforts to promote widerranging security technologies and encourage their
use. To this end the federal government is fostering the dissemination of basic security infrastructure through such measures as Internet identity
verification based on the new identity card, De-Mail

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | FOREWORD

and the smart meter profile. We are encouraged
by the various forward-looking enterprises who
have built on these measures to implement smart
and creative solutions and augment applications
with scalable IT security in order to vigorously
combat the IT risks faced by a digitalised world.
Meanwhile, the envisaged IT security law will
form a further tool in providing better protection
for vital IT infrastructure. The BSI’s character as a
civil, technical-preventive agency has proven its
worth over the past 20 years, and because of this
its role in our cyber security architecture is to be
further reinforced. As a trusted expert body the
BSI will perform an advisory and accrediting IT
security function in the field of critical infrastructure. To speed up response times, exchanges of
information on threats and attacks on IT systems
are also being intensified. It will only be possible
to ensure that reliable and appropriate security
measures for information technology in Germany
are in place if a cooperative working relationship
and partnership between business and the government can be guaranteed. The BSI faces corresponding challenges both for its professional expertise
and its role as a coordinating body working with the
various other federal and state security agencies.

Dr. Thomas de Maizière
Federal Minister of the Interior

I am convinced that the BSI’s robust organisational
structure will enable us to create an improved
security situation despite the ever-growing threats
emanating from cyberspace.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

1 Information technology:
interconnected, complex, pervasive
Digitalisation features three central characteristics
from which the challenges facing information and
cyber security derive:

1
2
3

Technological permeation and interconnection: all physical systems are embraced
by IT and connected step by step with the
Internet.
Complexity: the complexity of IT increases
significantly as a result of vertical and horizontal integration into the wealth creation
processes.
Pervasiveness: every system is available
practically all the time and in any place via
the Internet.

Technological permeation
and interconnection
The information technology of today is characterised by its powerful, value-adding capacity for integration into virtually any technological system,
thereby driving the continuing digitalisation of
the world we live in. Attractive features and prices
help develop a market for private users, while
mobile solutions and applications on intuitive end
devices also open up promising development
opportunities in the professional sphere. The rapid
adaptation of such solutions in business and
industry means that the boundaries between the
private and professional use of IT disappear. This
also leads indirectly to the traditionally strictly
segregated IT networks operated by companies
becoming ever more open to the Internet. This
applies not only to office communication but also
to manufacture and production.
How far this wide-ranging interconnection of
different systems extends may be illustrated by
taking a look at the factory of the future, which
goes by the name of ‘Industry 4.0’. With the objective of making as much information as possible
digitally useable, the entire company’s digitally
enabled systems are networked with each other
both internally and externally: the machines,
sensors and field devices in the production facilities, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems,

marketing, sales and purchasing. Along the value
chain too the ongoing interconnection of IT
systems with supplies, customers and service
partners will be fostered. This trend will continue
to shape technological development within
companies, with some 11 billion euros of Industry 4.0-related investment expected in Germany
between now and 20201. No business will be able
to opt out of this trend, because the efficiency and
productivity gains achievable through Industry
4.0 will have to be harvested if the business wishes
to remain competitive.
A consequence of this rapidly progressing digitalisation and interconnection is that the protection
of IT networks and IT systems at a company’s
perimeter is becoming ever more eroded and new
attack interfaces are opening up. In addition, IT
systems hitherto unreachable from the Internet
are becoming potential targets. For IT security
this entails a far more complex risk situation, as
well as holding out the prospect of an increasing
risk of existence-threatening situations due to the
breakdown or malfunctioning of production or
business processes.

IT complexity
The interconnection of all systems and things,
creating an Internet of things, coupled with the
digitalisation of physical systems (cyber-physical
systems) greatly increases the complexity of the
digital infrastructure. Today many household
appliances, building control systems, threat and
fire alarm systems, traffic systems and automobiles are interconnected and linked with the
Internet. A trend now foreseeable for the near
future is the emergence of the digitally enhanced
smart city.
As the complexity of systems increases, familiar
conventional IT security mechanisms rapidly
reach their limits and become incapable of guaranteeing the accustomed degree of reliability
and manageability. The need for innovative
approaches designed to ensure an adequate level
of IT security for the entire system is already
apparent, and it will only increase over the coming years.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

Pervasiveness through smartphones
Innovation and change are inextricably linked
with modern information technology. However,
even in the IT industry the extent of the smartphone boom is unrivalled, having been sustained
over a period of many years. Smartphone and
tablet users now number in the billions, as the
devices exert a huge influence over the daily
lives of their owners. The smartphone is not just
a wireless extension of established PC technology,
rather it involves the bundling of a whole array
of technological and conceptual considerations
which, taken together, delineate a new, selfcontained sphere of information technology.
Our existing IT security knowledge and techniques are not directly transferable to this sphere
and will have to be rethought and adapted.
A standout feature of smartphones is that they
are always on, with a continuous broadband
Internet connection and incessant device activity
even without any intervention by the user. Furthermore, most smartphones are taken by their
users wherever they go and provide a detailed
record of their whereabouts and the communications they engage in. In future the smartphone
will evolve into an electronic wallet with which
people will be able to make payments both over
the Internet and directly at the checkout via
a radio link, and then, if not before, we shall have
to address the question of the actual effectiveness
of the security systems with which this mobile
platform is equipped. As a rule smartphone users
are reliant upon the operating system’s security
mechanisms cutting in. There is little scope left
for users to take individual action to strengthen
security, such action being largely confined to the
secure configuration of the devices.

8

Not only the device itself but also the ‘economic
system’ to which a smartphone is assigned play
a central role in its IT security. This overall economic system comprises not only its operating
system but also an array of background systems
such as the app store, content download platforms and cloud-based backup systems offered
by that provider. The self-contained nature and
central management of this ‘ecosystem’ do offer
a degree of basic security that cannot be achieved
in the traditionally open world of the PC without
additional protective mechanisms, but it is not
transparent for users, and there is no provision for
scalability where security needs may be greater.
As a key component in the system’s overall economy, security thus forms the foundation for the
bundled marketing of goods and services and is
therefore a principal objective for providers.
Among the factors driving the success of smartphones as a product category, the app takes pride
of place. It represents the true quantum leap,
because it means that acquiring a smartphone
opens up for users access to millions of application programs via online marketplaces such as
the Apple App Store, Google Play or the Microsoft
Windows Phone Store.
Furthermore, smartphones not only facilitate the
acquisition of software but also lower the bar for
those wishing to take the plunge and become software producers to such an extent that over one
hundred thousand providers are now represented
on the various online marketplaces. To add to data
privacy law considerations, apps pose the greatest
potential for attack from an IT security viewpoint.
The operating systems themselves are comparatively well protected, whereas what apps can do in
the operating system is authorised by the users
themselves. However, this kind of authorisation
procedure is largely ineffective since in the great
majority of cases requests are accepted by users
without giving the matter any thought.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

Pervasiveness via clouds

Outlook

Cloud services provide processing and storage of
information centrally via a network plus standardised interfaces. They outsource applications,
computing power and storage from (mobile)
devices to cloud data centres. The key benefits of
cloud services are that often complex functions
are offered in a recylable way by a central agency,
managing the services is easier and can readily
be scaled, while computing power is outsourced
from the device to the data centre. Taken together
these considerations can generate significant
economic benefits.

For many private users the smartphone has
become the linchpin of their access to worldwide
information and services. The future integration
of payment and health functions as well as home
automation interfaces means that the boundary
between the physical and virtual worlds will
become increasingly blurred. As a result issues
surrounding the security of mobile devices and
their commercial ecosystem will become ever
more relevant.

Smartphones, tablets and apps now offer a variety
of different interfaces with the cloud services
offered by the various mobile systems and thirdparty providers. These services also allow such
things as the synchronisation of contacts, appointments, e-mails, photos and documents on different devices. This means that some of the information stored and processed in the cloud is highly
personal. However, there is no certainty that the
data stored are both secure from unauthorised
access and will be permanently accessible. As a
rule cloud service providers’ general terms and
conditions largely disclaim liability for the data
entrusted to them.

In a business context, from an IT security viewpoint issues other than mobility also have to be
taken into account. The use of cloud-based information processing holds the promise of speed
gains and cost savings, but is still often viewed
with suspicion on organisational, technical and
security-related grounds. Furthermore, companies using industrial control and automation
technology are impacted by the convergence of
this technology with classical information and
communication technology, including mobile
use, and this throws up a whole new raft of IT
security challenges.

Accordingly, before a business chooses to use
cloud services those in charge first need to address
various questions. For instance, what information is suitable for cloud processing and storage,
and whether this is permissible given compliance requirements, in particular concerning data
privacy. More and more cloud service providers
are setting up shop in this booming market and
it is not easy to identify a trustworthy provider
who complies with the company’s own security
requirements. The opportunity to benefit from
economies of scale must than be set against a loss
of control over the company’s own information.

2 Security threats
The increasing digitalisation and interconnection
of many aspects of our private and working lives
goes hand in hand with dynamic security threats.
The causes of cyber attacks, attack methods and
the use of attack tools evolve on a daily basis, all
the while interacting and influencing each other in
complex ways.

2.1

Causes

Cyber attacks targets companies, governments
and private users are a daily occurrence. Many
attacks are successful, both because the attackers
are becoming increasingly professional and
because they encounter circumstances which
they know how to exploit to their advantage.

2.1.1 The Internet as a platform for attacks
The Internet is used as a platform of attack on
account of its open structure, as well as the technical opportunities and anonymity it offers. This
is reflected today in the huge number of cyber
attacks. To launch a successful cyber attack all you
generally need are a PC and an Internet connection. These modest investments can be set against
a multitude of opportunities to make money
through criminal activities, to acquire confidential
information or to engage in acts of sabotage. The
necessary attack tools and methods are cheap and
easy to acquire. There is a thriving global market
on which attack tools, vulnerabilities, malware or
even website traffic can be purchased or ordered
as a service (malware as a service). Illegally acquired
data such as user account details and credit card
information are also traded there, with both wellorganised groups and individuals offering their
skills and services on these criminal online marketplaces. The Internet’s attractiveness as a platform
of attack may be illustrated by the following factors which attackers exploit for their own ends:

∙ The increasing complexity of technology coupled
with a frequent lack of security awareness leads
to inadequately protected systems, increasing the
prospect of a successful cyber attack.
∙ The careless exchanging of information over the
Internet and the always-on status of mobile
systems facilitates access to sensitive information.
∙ The decentralised, open structure of the Internet
gives attackers a wide range of concealment opportunities which minimise the risk of discovery.
∙ Varying legal frameworks in different countries
make criminal prosecution more difcult.
The professionalisation and separation of roles in
the field of cybercriminality are steadily increasing. Thus the work involved in a cyber attack may
be divided up among different people or groups
who specialise in certain tasks which they perform independently of each other. These groups
include:
∙ Hackers, who seek out new vulnerabilities in
widely used software products and offer them
for sale.
∙ Developers who design and adapt malware or
tools for the generation of malware which can
then exploit these vulnerabilities.
∙ Attackers who use this malware to steal
information.
∙ Criminals who sell, exploit or make money from
the use of the stolen information.
Thus even inexperienced attackers with no technical expertise can carry out or arrange the carrying out of professional attacks on a chosen target
without having to concern themselves with the
technical details or the execution of the attack.

∙ The increasing interconnection of information
technology permits remote attacks from virtually
anywhere in the world at any time and on ever
more targets. As a result attackers do not have to
take any direct risks at the scene of the crime.

11

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

2.1.2 ‘Digital carelessness’
In the wake of media reports about the Snowden
revelations, cyber attacks on well-known companies
and the associated loss of customer data, coupled
with incidents involving large-scale identity theft,
many users have lost confidence in information
technology. Consumers appear to be increasingly
aware of the issue of IT security. A study published
by the German Institute for Trust and Security
on the Internet (Deutsches Institut für Vertrauen
und Sicherheit im Internet – DIVSI)2 has confirmed
that the German public’s confidence in the Internet has significantly deteriorated. However, these
concerns stand in contrast with the apparent
carelessness which continues to be observed, both
in business and private IT use. Despite increased
awareness [of security issues] and loss of confidence [in the Internet], there has only been a very
slight increase in numbers taking practical steps
to improve their security. For instance, the uptake
of e-mail encryption remains very low3. Solutions
are available, but they frequently do not meet user
requirements in terms of convenience, intuitiveness and ease of operation, and these factors are
often decisive in determining whether or not such
solutions catch on.
Where users have been duped through social
engineering, it is once again convenience, or the
prospect of an ostensible benefit, which induces
them to disclose personal information or run
malware. Every day we are inundated by waves
of professionally produced spam and attempts to
access personal data using fake websites, e-mails
or texts. Often the spam fraudulently claims to
be from well-known companies or institutions
in order to induce recipients to click on a link or
file attachment, thereby infecting their computers
with malware. In the field of mobile communication, too, convenience is the main criterion when
users install and run smartphone apps without
considering the consequences. Furthermore, basic
security measures such as effective patch management, whereby available security updates of
programs are downloaded as soon as possible, are
still often neglected.
Even if people are aware of the threats they face
they do not always take appropriate security
measures. This applies not only to private users
but also to many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Thus we find that the systems used
by SMEs4, like those of private individuals5, frequently have insufficient protection to fight off
even the simplest attacks. However, the level of
defensive and protective measures found in networks and associated infrastructure in Germany
is very variable, with the networks of major enterprises generally having appropriate protective

12

measures in place. Despite this, according to a survey conducted by the Alliance for Cyber Security
(Allianz für Cyber-Sicherheit)6 companies report
growing threats from data theft attacks and targeted attacks by cybercriminals or government
attackers. The main reason cited for attacks proving successful was software vulnerabilities. However, a patch management system was in place at
only three quarters of the companies surveyed.
Over half of the surveyed companies admitted
that the measures currently in place to protect
themselves from cyber attacks are not sufficient
and that additional measures are planned in the
medium term. It is disturbing that the majority of
surveyed companies assign less than five per cent
of their total IT budgets to IT security measures.
Alongside all these technical protective measures,
user behaviour is another key factor for enhancing Internet security. The increasing complexity
and mobility of information technology means it
is ever more important for users, manufacturers
and service providers alike to foreswear ‘digital
carelessness’, address IT security issues promptly
and conscientiously and convert their concerns
into practical action.

2.1.3 Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are the basis for the development
of cyber attack tools and the reason why cyber
attacks can succeed. As in earlier years, in 2013
and 2014 the number of critical vulnerabilities
found in standard IT products remained high.
In 13 widely used software products alone (see
Table 1) 705 critical vulnerabilities were identified
in 2013, and in 2014 the BSI is expecting over
700 more (Figure 1). Vulnerabilities are inevitable
in modern software. Developing bug-free software is a practical impossibility outside of highly
restricted specialist areas. For this group of widely
used products alone the detection of an average of two critical vulnerabilities per day can be
expected.
Given the sheer number of vulnerabilities manufacturers’ software updating systems are of great
importance. Manufacturers are increasingly forced
to prioritise when eradicating vulnerabilities,
concentrating on the critical ones.
Details of vulnerabilities generally do not emerge
until after the software manufacturer releases
the corresponding security update or patch.
Accordingly it is vital to download these software
updates as quickly as possible. If details of the
vulnerability, or even exploits of a given vulnerability, enter the public domain before the soft-

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

ware manufacturer’s patch comes out (zero-day
exploits), great care should be taken if using the
affected software. Up to the end of July there had
been five known incidents of this nature in 2014.
Software products
∙ Adobe Flash Player
∙ Adobe Reader
∙ Apple OS X
∙ Apple Quicktime
∙ Apple Safari
∙ Google Chrome
∙ Linux Kernel

∙ Microsoft Internet Explorer
∙ Microsoft Office
∙ Microsoft Windows
∙ Mozilla Firefox
∙ Mozilla Thunderbird
∙ Oracle Java/JRE

Table 1: Selection of widely used software products

2.1.4 Using out-of-date software
and unpatched systems
Downloading software updates is fundamental
to maintaining a secure IT system. Despite this,
operating systems and applications with outof-date patches are the most common problem
identified by BSI audits and penetration tests
of government departments, and many private
users’ systems are not always fully up to date.

mobile sphere Android devices in particular are
frequently found to be running on outdated versions of operating system9. Many manufacturers
of devices only provide their updates for brief
periods. Support for older versions is discontinued
at the latest when the annual successor model
appears. Once that happens patches are no longer
produced for newly discovered vulnerabilities,
which thus pose a threat to all older devices.
As a general rule, software products for which
product support has been discontinued should
no longer be run because these products have
stopped receiving security updates. A recent
example is Microsoft Windows XP, for which
extended product support ceased in April 2014,
since which time neither functional nor security
updates have been produced for Windows XP.
Despite this, the market share of Windows XP
in Germany by mid-2014 still stood at over eight
per cent, while the worldwide figure is over 15
per cent10.

Despite the standard recommendation to use
auto-update mechanisms, according to IT experts
at least ten per cent of all Windows operating
systems and other widely used software products
in Germany have out-of-date patches7, and this
figure should be regarded as a minimum.
Unpatched systems are not only a problem for
desktops, they also afflict servers and mobile
devices in a similar fashion. For instance, in February 2014 six million websites8 worldwide were
using the outmoded, easy-to-attack Version 1.3
of the Apache server software. Meanwhile, in the

detected up to September.

13

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

Typical security deficits
The BSI conducts regular security checks, penetration tests
and information security audits of government departments.
Among the security issues most frequently encountered are:
» Out-of-date operating systems and application patches and
deactivation of available security mechanisms.
» Easy-to-guess passwords are used, even for critical applications. Not infrequently standard passwords, empty passwords
or other weak passwords are used.
» Network management and monitoring measures are either
non-existent or used as isolated solutions, log records are kept
locally only and merely manually evaluated should the occasion
arise.
» No use of network management controls (including for maintenance access and connections) designed to restrict access to
the internal network to authorised official devices only.
» Interface controls are missing for mobile storage media, and
unencrypted mobile devices.
» Changes are made to applications, operating systems and
networks without any suitable change management or
documentation.
» Training and awareness-raising activities, in particular for users,
either do not take place or are insufficient.
» Responsibilities for information security among company
directors, government department heads or senior management are often unclear.
» Security concepts are incomplete and inconsistent.

2.1.5 Mobile devices
Classical desktop and laptop computers are increasingly being complemented or even replaced
by smartphones and tablets. Mobile devices represent an attractive target for attacks because
they usually reflect the entire ‘digital lives’ of their
owners, from e-mails to social media, flight tickets,
banking or location information. Alongside the
risks of loss or theft, they pose special IT security
challenges in terms of operating system updates
and apps. Due to rapid developments in the hardware sphere software updates are often available
only for short periods, after which vulnerabilities
are no longer be fixed. A further threat arises from
the bewildering variety of available apps, which
not infrequently contain malicious and espionage
features. Due to its open approach Android is
particularly susceptible to these.

14

Particularly when using mobile devices people
want to be able to access their data whenever and
wherever. As a result sometimes very personal
information is stored in a cloud, and if access to
the cloud is inadequately protected this information is at severe risk, as for instance demonstrated
by a recent incident in which intimate photos
of celebrities were stolen from the iCloud and
published on the Internet.

Threats to mobile devices increasing steadily
Reports from all producers of antivirus software indicate that
the amount of malware targeting mobile devices is steadily
increasing. In addition to established attack methods of the kind
directed at PCs, the ‘always on’ nature of mobile devices opens
up further attack opportunities:
» Infection with malware via apps
Alongside their ostensibly useful features apps may also conceal malicious code. For instance Trojans which masquerade as
apps while actually gathering information in the background,
sending costly text messages at the user’s expense or making
undesired phone calls.
» Use of public hotspots
Most public hotspots do not offer encryption. The data are
transmitted openly and can thus be read by unauthorised
third parties. Particularly risky here are online banking or the
transmission of confidential information.
» Surveillance and data theft
The location of mobile devices, and therefore their owners,
can be traced at any time not only by the operators of wireless
networks and app providers but also by cybercriminals who
have access to the device. Smartphone surveillance coupled
with the theft of information such as passwords, images, log
files and GPS coordinates allows criminals to compile comprehensive profiles of their victims.
» Tapping phone calls
Calls made via the GSM standard for mobile voice and data
transmissions are not safe from eavesdropping, meaning that
sensitive or secret information may fall into third-party hands.

2.1.6 Inadequate security for
Industrial Control Systems
Production and process automation systems,
collectively known as Industrial Control Systems
(ICS), are deployed in virtually all infrastructure in
which physical processes take place. Implementing
Industry 4.0, one trend is towards the extended
interconnection of these Industrial Control
Systems beyond a company’s internal networks.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

As a result IT components become ever more
integrated into the actual production networks
in order to render industrial processes more
efficient and effective on a global scale. However,
few of these systems were designed with potential
attacks in mind.

Threats to Industrial Control Systems in industry
and manufacturing
Production and process automation systems are increasingly
susceptible to cyber attack. Operators have to bear in mind the
risk and harmful potential not only of non-targeted malware
but also of targeted, high-quality attacks on ICS infrastructure
which are mounted at significant expense.
The central threats to which ICSs are currently exposed are11:

Attack tools and methods

Tools and methods used in cyber attacks today
are manifold. They are deployed and combined
in myriad ways to launch both broad-based and
highly targeted cyber attacks against individuals
or institutions. This section discusses the attack
methods in current use, outlines the current
situation and offers brief assessments of each
method.

2.2.1 Spam
Spam is defined as unwanted messages sent en
masse and in an untargeted fashion via e-mail
or other communication services. In harmless
variants spam messages generally contain unsolicited advertising. However, spam often comes
with attachments containing malware, links to
websites with drive-by exploits, or it may be used
for phishing attacks. To send out spam messages
large-scale resources such as botnets or compromised servers are required.
Situation

Social engineering

Human error and sabotage

Unauthorized use of Remote Service Access

∙ 2014 saw major growth of around 80 per cent as
compared with 2013, bucking the trend of recent
years in which spam volumes had stagnated (see
Fig. 2).
∙ Germany is midway down the Top 10 in the global
list of spam senders.
∙ 2014 saw a 36 per cent rise in e-mails with
malware in the attachments.

Alongside attacks which succeed due to software
implementation errors, social engineering plays
an ever greater role. In this method largely nontechnical contrivances are used to gain unauthorised access to information or IT systems, exploiting human proclivities such as helpfulness, curiosity, trust or fear. To combat this, measures such
as raising awareness and training are further key
components of any effective ICS security system.
Moreover, from this appraisal of the most significant threats facing Industrial Control Systems
it is apparent that devising IT security systems,
architectures and standards will be key factors
determining the success of efforts to implement
and secure acceptance for Industry 4.0.

∙ Since the beginning of 2014 a trend towards
the generation and sending of pseudorandom
malware variants has been observed.
∙ Criminals increasingly send Office documents as
attachments, with malware being downloaded via
macros in these documents.
∙ Due to identity theft spam is increasingly sent via
compromised user accounts utilising established
e-mail service providers.

15

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

Assessment
Spam is a long familiar phenomenon, and countermeasures such as spam filters or greylisting
have generally reduced its volume. As a result,
these days spam is largely unproblematic from
an operational viewpoint. However, the quality
and quantity of malware spam are continuing
to increase. The one-time use of malware code
variants increases the cost of analysis and slows
down the provision of suitable defensive measures such as signatures for antivirus programs.

2.2.2

Malware

Malware programs are tools whereby attackers can
exercise control over an infected system. Malware
comes in a variety of forms, such as viruses, Trojan
horses, bots and rootkits. However, modern malware is often difficult to unambiguously categorise
as it is modular in structure and embodies or even
downloads a variety of different malicious functions. Today malware affects not only classical PCs
and notebooks but also increasingly mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets.
Situation
∙ The total number of PC-based malware variants is
now estimated at around the 250 million mark.
∙ In Germany there are at least one million malware
infections a month.
∙ The number of malware variants increases at a
rate of about 300,000 a day.

Figure 2: Qualitative weekly spam figures in Germany since January 2012

16

∙ The most common ways of spreading malware
are drive-by exploits, spam attachments and
botnets.
∙ The most frequently detected malware types are
adware and Trojans.
∙ Microsoft Windows is by far the operating system
most frequently affected by malware, accounting
for around 95 per cent of all instances.
∙ Mobile platforms: at least three million malware programs exist for mobile devices such as
smartphones or tablets. 98 per cent of these
are designed for the Android operating system.
∙ Malware for mobile platforms usually masquerade as legitimate apps. They are predominantly
distributed via alternative app stores or websites
rather than official app stores like Google Play, or
are installed unwittingly by the users themselves.
∙ Attackers’ deployment of malware is increasingly
professional, for instance involving improved
methods of concealing the control servers, the
use of Twitter channels or Google Docs as command-and-control (C&C) servers, as well as the
use of cutting-edge encryption techniques such
as elliptic curve cryptography to safeguard the
communication.
∙ Alongside classical malware which steals data or
manipulates online banking activities, ransomware, malware which blocks access to systems or
encrypts user data in order to then extort ‘ransom
money’, has become a further everyday tool in the
cybercriminal’s arsenal.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

Assessment

2.2.3 Drive-by exploits and exploit kits

Due to the sheer volume and complexity of new
malware programs the time which elapses before
new malware is detected by antivirus programs
ranges from a few hours to several days. During
this window a system may be unprotected. As a
result the classical signature-based components
of antivirus programs are increasingly reaching
the limits of their effectiveness, meaning that the
ongoing evolution of novel protective measures
will be needed. Furthermore, malware developers put a great deal of ingenuity into coming up
with a steady stream of new methods designed
to hamper the manual analysis of malware and
incidents by analysts and forensic scientists.

The term drive-by exploit refers to the automated
exploitation of vulnerabilities when a prepared
website is visited. It involves the exploitation, without any user interaction, of vulnerabilities in the
browser, in plug-ins or in the operating system to
enable the undetected installation of malware on
the website visitor’s system. Drive-by exploits are
particularly effective when utilised in the form of
exploit kits involving the use of not one but several
exploits which automatically seek out multiple
vulnerabilities in the browser or its plugins and use
them for the installation of malware. In watering
hole attacks drive-by exploits are used to execute
targeted attacks.
Situation
∙ Drive-by exploits are placed either on large numbers of compromised websites or individually
targeted ones.
∙ An evaluation of Google Safe Browsing data12
indicates that the proportion of websites in
Germany in the past 12 months infected with
drive-by exploits or other means of distributing
malware stood at four per cent.

Figure 3: Number of Windows malware variants

∙ In recent months exploit kit attacks have most
frequently been directed at vulnerabilities in
Internet Explorer, while Oracle Java has also been
a popular attack target, albeit not to the same
extent as in 2013.

Figure 4: Example of a malware infection via drive-by exploit

17

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

Assessment

2.2.4 Botnets

Exploit kits play a central role in cyber attacks of
a criminal nature. An exploit kit integrated into a
popular website will swiftly infect a large number of vulnerable systems without the knowledge of or any action by the user. In this kind of
broad-based or untargeted attack method the
victims are infected with a variety of malware, for
instance ransomware designed to extort money,
Trojan horses for identity theft purposes as well
as bots to develop the infrastructure for sending
spam or launching DDos attacks. Currently the
various manufacturers have produced security
updates for all the vulnerabilities used by exploit
kits, in view of which efficient patch management should permit the thwarting of any exploit
kit attacks. Utilisation of zero-day exploits in
exploit kits are a rarity.

A botnet is a collection of systems which have
been attacked by a remotely controllable malware
variant known as a bot. The affected systems
are controlled by the botnet operator via a command-and-control server (C&C server). Botnets
are used by criminals to commit information
theft and online banking fraud on a grand scale,
to launch distributed denial of service (DDos)
attacks or to send high volumes of spam, phishing
mails or e-mails with malware as attachment.

Malicious advertising banners
In 2013 the BSI identified over 350 compromised OpenX servers
hosted in Germany from which malicious advertising banners
were being superimposed over website images. The malicious
code which came with the advertising banners was indicative of
drive-by exploits. At potential risk were any visitors who had not
installed the latest security updates for the Windows operating system or such software as Oracle Java, Adobe Reader or
Flash Player. When users visit the website the infection occurs
unnoticed and without any user action: they do not even have
to click on the malicious banner.
Some of the OpenX servers were operated by media agencies,
as a result of which some of the websites on which malicious
banners appeared were popular ones with several thousand
visitors a day. The BSI notified the website operators, OpenX
servers and responsible providers about the compromises13. In
some cases BSI had to do so several times, either because the
operators did not respond or due to servers being compromised
again after cleaning.
Apart from the need to promptly install security updates, this
once again highlights the fact that the risk of malware infection
via advertising banners is not confined to the dark areas of the
Internet but also appear on popular, reputable websites.

18

Situation
∙ It is estimated that in Germany alone more than a
million computers are part of a botnet.
∙ Due to the professionalisation and commercialisation of cybercrime activities, establishing and
operating a botnet is comparatively cheap and
easy even for people without significant technical
expertise.
∙ Information theft is one of the greatest problems
in relation to botnets. Alongside classical end
user systems, attacks are being launched with
ever growing frequency on Internet-enabled
devices which process information such as payment details.
∙ Increasingly even web servers are being compromised and incorporated into botnets. Due to
their broadband network connections and high
availability these systems are particularly suitable
for such activities as DDos attacks.
Assessment
As recent reports of information theft and online
banking fraud by botnets clearly show, the situation may be viewed as critical. Botnet infrastructures provide Internet criminals with immense
resources of computer capacity and bandwidth
which they can use for their nefarious activities.
Today botnets are predominantly composed of
Windows systems, but cybercriminals are increasingly turning their attention to Mac OS X and
Android devices as target platforms for botnets.
Other Internet-enabled devices such as DSL routers or smart TVs have also fallen victim to attacks
and infection. One reason for this is the weaker
protective mechanisms with which these devices
are equipped. In light of the trend towards an
Internet of things this issue can only grow in
importance.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

2.2.5 Social engineering
In attacks using social engineering, criminals
attempt to induce their victims to disclose data of
their own free will, circumvent protective measures and willingly install malicious code on their
systems. Just like in the field of espionage, cybercriminals skilfully exploit human weaknesses
such as curiosity to gain access to sensitive data
and information.
Situation
∙ The growing trend towards making personal data
and information available to the general public via
social networks or private websites makes it easier for criminals to use this information to prepare
targeted attacks involving social engineering.
∙ Criminals frequently exploit human curiosity for
interesting information, the desire for a bargain,
prudence or bad conscious in the face of official
threats or threats of criminal action, as well as the
increased public attention stirred up by major
events such as the football world cup, public
holidays or current economic or social affairs such
as the introduction of the Single Euro Payments
Area (SEPA).
∙ Phishing attacks, in which e-mails with falsified
senders are sent in an attempt to induce users to
disclose personal details, continue to proliferate.
The ostensible senders are well-known companies and organisations, financial service providers
and familiar online shops, e-mail or communications providers. Fictional orders, invoices, warnings or security notices direct users to fraudulent
websites where they are asked to update or
confirm access data, account information or other
customer details.

which contain malware. Often the spurious bank
websites can barely be distinguished from the
genuine articles.
∙ Social engineering is a fundamental component
of targeted attacks.
Assessment
Technical measures increase your level of IT security but they cannot guarantee complete protection on their own. This is particularly apparent
from cases of attacks involving social engineering.
While users continue to unnecessarily disclose
private details or click on an e-mail offering a
spurious commercial inducement, criminals will
continue to use social engineering to gain financial advantage from the data they thereby obtain.
Because social engineering also often constitutes
the gateway for targeted attacks on companies
and government departments, employee training
and awareness raising are vital. The example of
phishing clearly shows how important prudent
behaviour by users is for data security.

Figure 5: Example of a phishing e-mail –
recognisable by the falsified sender address

∙ In one particularly exhaustive attack on German
companies employees received e-mails which
allegedly came from their personnel departments.
The e-mails, which came complete with long
falsified threads and spurious Executive Board
decisions, asked the recipients to disclose details
such as their personnel and account data. The
criminals then used the data to make withdrawals from accounts and order new electronic cash
cards.
∙ In online banking users are induced via manipulated test credit transfers or user verifications
involving TAN or mTAN to enter data in fraudulent web forms or install ostensible security apps

2.2.6 Identity theft
Identity theft or misuse involves the acquisition
and unauthorised use by third parties of personal
data such as postal and e-mail addresses, dates
of birth, bank account and credit card numbers.
The attackers’ aim is generally to gain financial
advantage using the confidential information, or
more rarely to discredit the person whose details
have been stolen. Identity theft is chiefly done via
social engineering, malware on infected systems
or data theft after hacking of online services.

contribution to the protection of personal data
for minimal effort or outlay. Online service providers should also be more diligent in providing
better protective measures for their systems and
their customers’ data. For instance, customer
data and the corresponding databases should be
operated in encrypted form as a matter of course,
while users should be offered secure authentication procedures such as those involving twofactor authentication. This can for instance be
done using the new identity cards, which millions
of German citizens now possess.

Situation
∙ Identity theft is an everyday occurrence. Every
month large numbers of digital identities are
stolen from infected computers of private users
alone.
∙ The amount of identity theft malware is steadily
increasing. The BSI alone analyses approximately
11,000 malware programs a month which are
implicated in identity theft in Germany.
∙ These days criminals use malware which specialises in certain data such as digital identities which
are then highly likely to be misused, for instance
in the fields of online banking or shopping.
∙ In spring 2014 the BSI published details of two
major identity theft incidents in which a total of
34 million e-mail addresses and passwords were
stolen.
∙ Attacks on service providers are also attractive,
indeed today the number of identities stolen
through attacks on the servers of online sellers
and service providers is significantly greater than
the number of identities stolen from infected user
machines. For instance, one attack on eBay in
May 2014 affected 145 million customers worldwide, around 15 million of them in Germany.

20

2.2.7 Denial of service
Denial of service (DoS) attacks are directed at
the availability of services, websites, individual
systems or entire networks. If such an attack is
launched in parallel by several systems this is
known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack. DDoS attacks frequently involve very large
numbers of computers. The computers in question may have been brought together unwittingly
to form a botnet or may be compromised systems,
but could also be computers which have been
linked up by willing participants, as for instance
in politically motivated attacks. DDoS attacks on
large companies or governments often involve
political or ideological motives, whereas attacks
on e-commerce providers increasingly stem
from competitors or extortionists. There are also
increasing numbers of DDoS attacks on critical
infrastructure operators such as banks, transport
companies and media organisations. Here too
criminals are chiefly motivated by financial gain,
for instance through extortion.
Situation
∙ So far in 2014 there have been over 32,000 DDoS
attacks in Germany alone.

Assessment

∙ Virtually every sector is afflicted by DDoS attacks.

The cyber threat posed by identity theft will continue to rise as long as professionally organised
attackers have a large number of inadequately
protected systems, run both by private users and
service providers, at their disposal. Password
management and the regular downloading of
all relevant system updates make an important

∙ The Alliance for Cyber Security14 survey found
that over a third of the companies questioned
reported being the target of a DDoS attack on
their websites during the past three years.
∙ A quarter of the companies surveyed had suffered
DDoS attacks on their network infrastructure.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

∙ Since 2013 there has been increased use of reflection attacks, whereby the target system is not
attacked directly but rather through the misuse
of publicly available Internet services (e.g. DNS15
or NTP16). These involve attackers sending small
queries to a public service in the name of their
victim. The services then send their replies to the
victim’s system. Because the replies are usually a
lot larger than the queries, even a small number
of attacking systems can do great damage and
cripple the victim’s system. In reflection attacks
unwitting parties such as the service providers
become unwilling accomplices.
∙ To date the largest DDos attack took place in
February 2014, involving a bandwidth up to 400
gigabits per second. This attack was based on
NTP reflection.
∙ The number of NTP servers in Germany which
could be exploited for this kind of attack fell
between June 2014 and August 2014 from over
4,000 systems to around 2,500. This was due to
information given to the operators by the BSI.
Assessment
Global comparison shows that Germany is less
badly affected by this issue than other countries.
All in all, Germany is neither a major source of
such attacks nor a particularly frequent victim.
Nevertheless, DDos attacks can threaten the
survival of companies affected by them.

2.2.8 Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)
Advanced persistent threats are targeted cyber
attacks on specific institutions in which the attackers gain persistent access to the victim network
and then widen the attack to additional systems.
The attacks involve the deployment of major
resources and considerable technical skill on the
attackers’ part and are generally difficult to detect.
Situation
∙ APT attacks focus chiefly on the defence industry, high-tech sectors such as the automobile
industry, shipbuilding and aerospace, research
institutes and public administration.
∙ In APT attacks the initial infection is frequently
introduced using an e-mail with a prepared
attachment plus targeted social engineering.
Information from the recipient’s professional
milieu which is plausible or expected is used,
along with the name of a trustworthy sender.
With this kind of targeted social engineering it is
often impossible to distinguish between authentic and fraudulent messages.
∙ Another trend in the launching of APTs is the
use of watering hole attacks. In these a website
which is frequently visited by a target individual
is first compromised. When the target individual
visits that website their computer is infected with
malware via a drive-by exploit. Alternatively the
victim may be sent an e-mail with a link to a prepared website. The e-mail content produced via
social engineering induces the recipient to click
on the link.
∙ Frequently attacks initially focus on less technologically aware target individuals within companies.
∙ Within larger organisations the central directory
structures are generally the focus of the attack.
The next phase of the attack involves exfiltrating data or sabotaging target systems. Attackers attempt to keep the victim’s systems under
control as long as possible without the victim
becoming aware of the attack. Indeed, practical
experience shows that APTs often remain undetected for months or even years. In the final
phase of an APT attack any traces of it are eliminated as thoroughly as possible.

Figure 7: Procedures of an APT attack

21

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

Assessment
APT attacks pose a serious threat to the German
economy and public administration. Hacking into
poorly protected company servers will continue
to grow in significance. To permit companies
potentially at risk to be warned at an early stage
and produce a comprehensive picture of the
situation it is vital to more precisely evaluate the
mode of operation and attack tools used in APT
attacks. The reporting of incidents to the BSI by
affected companies makes an important contribution to this end.

2.2.9 Cyber attacks by intelligence agencies
Germany is subject to continuous cyber attacks
with the objective of obtaining information and
gaining financial advantages. During 2013 and
2014 both the technologically improved detection systems integrated by the BSI into the government’s networks and the evaluation of the
Edward Snowden revelations have increased our
technical knowledge and understanding of cyber
attacks launched by intelligence agencies and
the methods they use.
The BSI’s improved detection systems have uncovered strong and unambiguous evidence of
cyber attacks by intelligence agencies against German infrastructure in the business, research and
public administration spheres. These attacks have
also been observed both by BSI partner agencies
and BSI private sector partners. The Snowden
revelations were also instrumental in increasing
knowledge on intelligence activities. What was
surprising about them was the degree of professionalism they revealed, along with the scale
and extent of the surveillance measures and the
copious resources assigned to the enterprise, both
in personnel and financial terms.
A more precise analysis of the available technical
findings allows to identify four principal attack
vectors:
∙ Strategic reconnaissance:
All the data accumulating at Internet and communication nodes are collected, stored and analysed.
This involves gathering the (connection) data of
large numbers of Internet users, from which
attackers can determine who has communicated
with whom, at what time and in what place. If
the content is unencrypted it can be eavesdropped
in its entirety, for instance in the case of VoIP
phone calls.

22

The same applies to data obtainable from Internet service providers such as social networks or
search services.
∙ Individual attacks in communications
and cyberspace:
These attacks are targeted at the IT systems of
prominent people and institutions. To this end
intelligence agencies first systematically analyse,
purchase and collect hitherto unpublished hardware and software vulnerabilities. This knowledge
base is then used to devise specifically adapted
cyber attacks to attack and control IT systems
identified at the strategic reconnaissance stage.
Radio and mobile communications can be individually tapped through corresponding attacks.
In this way individual users’ computers can be
infected with malware, whereafter they can be
monitored in real time from anywhere in the
world. If target individuals use a smartphone they
can be tracked, meaning that their location may
be determined at all times, and in many cases
strategic reconnaissance allows the identification
of the person’s interlocutor, who is also carrying a
smartphone or laptop.
∙ Influencing standards and implementations:
This involves manipulating IT standards and cryptographic standards in advance of the technical
reconnaissance, thereby systemically undermining the implementation of inherently stronger
security mechanisms designed to reinforce confidentiality. This means that strong, internationally
standardised cryptoalgorithms used in hardware
or software implementations are for instance
combined with weak random number generators, as a result of which they no longer provide
adequate protection of confidentiality.
∙ Targeted manipulation of IT equipment:
This involves intervention in ordering processes,
delivery or supply chains in order to manipulate
IT equipment. The process includes inserting back
doors or weakening technical security features.
For instance, monitors, keyboards and video or
audio cables are fitted with miniature transmitters which allow radio signals to be detected
from a greater distance. Network components
like routers can be manipulated by changing their
software so that they can be remotely controlled
or even switched off, thereby also facilitating
cyber sabotage.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

Exemplifying these attack vectors are attack
scenarios directed at mobile communications
shown in the following illustration.

Figure 8: Mobile communication attack vectors

All the options discussed above for compromising
ICT systems for technical or cyberespionage purposes can also be used in a similar fashion to carry
out cyber sabotage. This is particularly true of the
information and communication technology used
in critical infrastructures.

2.3

Typology of attackers

Despite the great proliferation of different attack
targets and possible attack methods, the motivation behind a cyber attack can frequently be put
down to financial interests, information procurement, sabotage, gaining of influence or the pursuit
of political interests. We may broadly distinguish
between three different categories of attacker:
criminals, intelligence agencies and hacktivists,
while malicious insiders forming a special category.

2.3.1 Cybercriminals
Introduction
The motivation of cybercriminals is to make money
by illegal means through the use of information
technology. The activities of organised cybercrime
include identity theft, product fraud, using stolen
banking information to steal money and extortion.
Organised cybercriminals are highly professional
in the way they exploit the advantages gained via
cyber attacks. In addition to organised crime we
also find individual criminals or smaller groups,
though they are generally characterised by a lower
level of professionalism.

Capabilities
The methods and variants used by cybercriminals
focus on technological progress as well as existing
defensive systems. In the process attackers exploit
the entire spectrum of technical options. For private users that involves the use of spam, phishing
e-mails and malware, identity theft, manipulation
of online banking, adware, scareware and ransomware. In addition, spurious job offers are used to
turn private individuals into financial agents or
goods agents who become unwitting accomplices
in financial or product fraud.
The range of attack scenarios affecting companies
include various forms of extortion and hacking
into server services. Furthermore, malware is increasingly being infiltrated into point of sale systems in order to read off customer data directly
from the checkout during the payment transaction.
In addition, in return for suitable payment criminals offer cyberespionage and competitor research
services. Spying on competitors enables companies to obtain sensitive internal information on
them and their products which can be converted
into a material advantage in global competition.
Objectives
Today cybercrime is pervasive. All user groups,
from private citizens to the worlds of business,
science and public administration, are affected.
As long as criminals see opportunities to make
money this way they will exploit those opportunities and continuously refine their methods.

23

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

The Cybercrime 2013 Federal Situation Assessment (Bundeslagebild) published by the Federal
Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt – BKA)
cites over 64,000 cases for the year 2013, though
the BKA assumes that the true figure is much
higher17. According to a survey by the Alliance for
Cyber Security, cybercriminals are the attacker
group that will pose the greatest threat over the
coming years.
Ransomware
Digital extortion using ransomware which blocks access to
infected systems or encrypts user data is as widespread in
Germany as elsewhere. The BSI Service Centre is regularly contacted by German citizens who have fallen victim to ransomware
attacks and are seeking help. To date in 2014 there have been
almost 1,200 such enquiries, while the total in 2013 came to
over 8,500. Since the start of 2014 several new ransomware
variants have been identified which are equipped with better
methods and are able to infect and encrypt user systems or servers. The first variants designed to attack Android smartphones
have also now been detected. If an extortion victim gives in to
the criminal’s demands a direct money transfer from the victim
to the criminal takes place, which is what makes ransomware
attractive to criminals. Anonymous payment systems such as
prepaid cards or so-called cryptocurrencies are used for the purpose. Thus, unlike product fraud or where financial agents are
used, there is no intermediary. The BSI advises victims not to pay
the sum demanded under any circumstances, rather cleaning the
affected computers and reporting the case to the police.

2.3.2 Intelligence agencies
Introduction
The primary purpose of cyber attacks by government intelligence agencies is military and economic espionage18. In the military sector cyberspace has today become a further key domain
alongside the classical military domains land, sea,
air and space.
Capabilities
The cyberspace capabilities of government intelligence agencies are limited only by the resources
devoted to them, which in some cases are vast. As
government organisations, intelligence agencies
have a great many methods at their disposal, from
access to central infrastructure components or
their operators, interventions in IT products ex
works or the insertion of back-doors into products
via manufacturers in their own countries. Classical cyber attacks, for instance via Trojan horses,
are used in targeted fashion and are of higher
quality than the attacks launched by cybercrim-

24

inals. Alongside standard tools and approaches we
find the use of specialised malware designed independently by them or by service providers. Furthermore, intelligence agencies can invest a great
deal of money in the search for vulnerabilities to
exploit. Given that, depending on their size and
quality, software packages will inevitably have
a certain number of vulnerabilities, new gateways
for cyber attacks are always open to them.
Objectives
The targets of attacks by intelligence agencies are
companies in key industries, critical infrastructure and the government agencies, administrative
bodies and research institutions of other countries. Depending on their background, espionage
and sabotage attacks are executed either with the
aim of furthering their own national interests
or gaining advantages for national businesses on
international markets. Due to their wide-ranging
capabilities, business, public administration and
private citizens may equally be the targeted or
unintended objects of intelligence agency activities. Given their quality, defending against these
attacks is only possible by putting a great deal of
effort and money into countermeasures.

2.3.3 Hacktivism and cyber activists
Introduction
In the hacktivism sphere attackers ostensibly use
computer systems and networks as a means of
protest and in the furtherance of political or ideological objectives. Through their actions hacktivists aim to draw attention to what they see as
political, social, economic or technological injustices. They often equate this form of protest with
conventional forms of protest such as demonstrations, activism or civil disobedience. However, for
the organisations under attack hacktivism can do
serious damage.
Capabilities
The hacktivist scene is heterogeneous and includes many different groups within which
individual grouping or even individual hacktivists may be pooled together, for example the
Anonymous movement, the revelation websites
or cyber occupiers. Hacktivists often act on the
spur of the moment and organise themselves
very rapidly. Hacktivists are capable of launching
DDos attacks, manipulating websites and sowing targeted disinformation via social networks.
They also engage in targeted information theft
followed by publication of data in order to gain
publicity for a specific demand. Not infrequently
hacktivist activities proceed in parallel with conventional protest campaigns.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

Objectives
Given their motivation the chief focuses of hacktivist activities are governments, government
organisations and major companies. The current
overall threat level in Germany is low. However,
the international threat level may be rated as
critical, with a large number of incidents affecting
critical infrastructure such as information and
communication technology (ICT), the food industry, media and culture.

2.3.4 Malicious insiders
Alongside the three types of attacker outlined
above, malicious insiders constitute a further
grouping who come into consideration as potential culprits for attacks on in-house or confidential information or acts of sabotage. Due to their
less restricted access to in-house know-how and
resources as compared with external attackers,
their chances of success in accessing undetected
into key corporate data and information is particularly high. Furthermore, malicious insiders
are able to analyse the protective measures in
place over long periods, thus making them easier
to circumvent. On top of this, malicious insiders
can exploit the trust placed in them by their own
organisation. Apart from employees, external
service providers may also become malicious
insiders if their activities give them influence
over or direct access to in-house information or
processes.

2.4

Summary

The current IT landscape and the multifaceted
nature of the security threats of today pose a
permanent challenge for users of information
technology. A wide variety of factors and circumstances are currently favourable for the execution of cyber attacks. Meanwhile, the continuous
refinement and professionalisation of attackers
and attack methods further increase the threats
facing information security.
Table 2 summarises the existing security threats,
attack methods. In view of the overall attack
potential posed by these threats, the state of IT
security in Germany may be viewed as critical.

Central causes and threats for private users
Private users’ systems are currently subject to
security threats deriving from the following
causes:

Inadequate patch management and use of
out-of-date software on all devices
Cyber attacks via spam e-mail containing
malicious attachments and social engineering involving the use of spurious invoices,
order confirmations or reminders to induce
users to run malware
Cyber attacks via compromised websites
or manipulated advertising banners which
install malware when visiting a website
Cyber attacks on service providers with a
view to stealing their customer data
‘Digital carelessness’ in handling mobile
devices and apps and disclosing personal
information

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SECURITY THREATS

Central causes and threats
for business and government
Many of the most prevalent threats affect private
citizens, business and the government in equal
measure as users of information and communication technology. This applies in particular to untargeted attacks such as spam e-mail or drive-by
attacks from compromised websites or advertising banners. However, given the greater complexity in business environments and the presumably
higher levels of security in place as compared
with private users, the central threats they face
and their causes do differ:

1
2
3
4
5

Targeted espionage attacks on businesses,
research bodies or the government executed
using precisely tailored social engineering, unknown vulnerabilities and specially
designed tools
Cyber attacks on company websites or
service offers
Insufficient protection of networked
Industrial Control Systems in manufacturing and production industries

High number of undisclosed cases
On top of the known threat situation we also
have to assume that there are a great many undisclosed cases. Here too the situation assessment is
based on the observation and analysis of a cross
section of the actual situation in Germany and
worldwide. The frequency with which incidents
go unreported makes it all the more difficult to
accurately appraise the actual situation. A study
on economic espionage19 came to the conclusion
that only around a quarter of all incidents come
to the attention of external experts or government agencies, while only five per cent of cases
ever get reported to the police or public prosecutors. Accordingly, rich sources of information on
attack methods, tools used and targets, as well
as on criminals and their motivations, are often
beyond the reach of investigators.
The incidents reported in the following chapter
illustrate the impact that vulnerabilities, malware
or inadequate security have had in the past. The
incidents serve as examples of how an apparently
abstract threat to institutions or individuals can
rapidly transform into concrete risks which cause
real damage.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INCIDENTS

3 Incidents
At the beginning of 2014 two incidents involving
millions of cases of digital identity theft were uncovered, and this marked a turning point in public
attitudes to cyber attacks. Since these incidents
current IT threats and cyber attacks have become
a focus of political and media attention. Apart
from the above-mentioned cases of identity theft
the incidents selected also highlighted how skilled,
flexible and thorough the attackers’ methods had
now become. The attacks affected all information
technology user groups, from companies, government departments, research institutes and private
citizens to critical infrastructure operators. Incidents
affecting critical infrastructure operators are particularly serious because any damage done by cyber
attacks could rapidly have severe consequences for
the general public and the economy as a whole.

3.1

Incidents affecting the federal
government

The BSI Situation Centre is the central reporting
office for IT security incidents affecting the federal government. Since 2010 government departments have been required to report serious security incidents to the Situation Centre immediately
and less critical incidents monthly. This enables
the BSI to not only monitor the immediate reaction to the actual attack but also to identify trends
and developments in relation to the threats facing
the federal government’s IT and networks and
take correspondingly early countermeasures.
The protection of federal government systems
and communication is based on a multilevel
security model. Alongside standard antivirus
programs additional protective measures are
used at different stages which can defend against
malicious e-mails in real time. Since May 2014
the associated procedure has led to the interception of up to 60,000 additional infected e-mails a
month in the federal government’s networks.
To successfully defend against high-grade attacks
an additional system is designed to detect attacks
which have already circumvented standard protective mechanisms. Thus far in 2014 some 15 to
20 attacks a day on the governmental network
have been detected which would have eluded
normal protective measures. An average of one
attack per day is a targeted attack attributed to
an intelligence agency. An additional protective
stage involves the blocking of outgoing commu-

28

nication. Internet traffic is checked to determine
whether it connects to known command and
control servers for botnets or espionage programs.
These connections from governmental networks
can be directly blocked and reported to the responsible authorities so that infected computers can
be cleaned. Thus, around 3,500 attempts to access
malicious servers are blocked every day. Since
the beginning of 2014 34 infected systems have
been identified which, despite being protected
by commercial IT security products, have been
compromised by malware. Around 1,100 website
operators have been informed by BSI that their
websites are distributing malware.
The BSI records an average of one denial of service (Dos) attack a month against individual federal
government websites. Many of the cases reported
to the BSI from federal government organisations
also related to the exploitation of vulnerabilities
in web applications. For instance, in several cases
attackers sent between 20,000 and 200,000 spam
messages by using scripts which automatically
fill in the ‘Forward’ or Recommendation function of websites to send the spam messages. In
this case the government department website’s
‘Recommend page’ feature was vulnerable, and
in response it was permanently deactivated or
furnished with additional protective measures.
In another attack over 900 employees were e-mailed
a link to a phishing website designed for that government department. The e-mail claimed that the
storage limit for the mailbox had been exceeded
and that it was unable to receive any more e-mails.
Because of this, in order to be able to receive any
more e-mails it would be necessary to confirm the
e-mail account. The phishing website asked for
people’s e-mail address, username and password.
Once the attack was detected access to the linked
phishing website was blocked.
Incidents which are not attributable to a cyber
attack can also have a major impact on the availability of IT infrastructure and therefore on IT
security. An evaluation of additional messages
that the situation centre received from the federal
government clearly showed that faults or breakdowns suffered by the data centre power and air
conditioning systems were often not adequately
compensated by the emergency power system and
could thus lead to power cuts lasting for hours.
Another cause of reports is the use of mobile
devices such as laptops and smartphones with

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INCIDENTS

access to government networks which are then
lost or stolen. Despite this, attacks on government
networks involving lost or stolen mobile devices
have not been registered.

3.2

Incidents affecting private users

3.2.1 Millions of cases of identity theft
in Germany
Incident
In spring 2014 two cases of identity theft became
public in which attackers gained access to the usernames and passwords of 16 and 18 million Internet users respectively.
Method
The criminals gained access to the data via systems infected with malware and attacks on online
services.
Impact
The criminals tried to use the e-mail addresses and
associated passwords to log in to e-mail accounts
and then use those accounts to send spam e-mails.
It can be assumed that the addresses and passwords in question allow access not only to e-mail
accounts but also to other online accounts, for
instance to online shops, Internet forums or social
networks.
Target groups
The attackers focused on Internet users in Germany
and other European countries.

3.2.2 Vulnerabilities in
home network routers
Incident
In early 2014 a vulnerability was identified in the
FRITZ!-Box routers produced by AVM.
Method
Attackers exploited an unpatched vulnerability
to gain access to the device and all configuration
data stored.
Impact
By gaining access to the configuration data the
attackers were able to manipulate the system. They
were also able to read data giving access to e-mail
accounts and other online services if that data had
been stored on the router. In addition the attackers used the vulnerability to make expensive calls
to premium-rate telephone numbers at the victim’s or the telephone company’s cost. The manufacturers have issued several warnings to users on
the need to download the security updates.
Target groups
Several million private users’ devices were affected
in Germany alone. Many SMEs and other companies who use these devices in their business
operations were also affected.
Technical capabilities
In both technical and organisational terms the
criminals acted in a professional fashion, exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in the
router’s operating system to obtain information
and cause the victim financial damage.

Technical capabilities
Attacks on Internet users via e-mails containing
malware, social engineering or drive-by exploits
have become an everyday matter. However, the
sheer volume of user data accessed at the beginning
of the year is indicative of the criminals’ professionalism.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INCIDENTS

3.2.3 Online banking Trojans:
from Feodo to Geodo

3.2.4 iBanking: malware
for smartphones

Incident
In May 2014 the online banking malware Geodo
superseded the Trojan Feodo, which had been
known since 2013.

Incident
Since mid-2013 underground forums have been
offering malware for monitoring and manipulating Android smartphones. The malware was used
for such purposes as attacks on online banking
transactions using mTANs.

Method
The attackers e-mailed deceptively authenticlooking invoices and reservation confirmations
in the name of telecommunications service providers and banks to distribute malware which was
either contained in a file attachment or provided
as a link in the message. The links led to compromised websites on which the attackers had placed
malware for downloading.
Impact
The attack wave persisted for several weeks and,
as had been the case with Feodo, was highly successful, leading to large numbers of infections. In
addition to manipulating online banking transactions Geodo obtained credentials from the infected PCs and transmitted them to the attackers’
command and control servers. This account data
was subsequently used to further distribute the
malware.
Target groups
The attackers focused on Internet users and bank
clients in Germany.
Technical capabilities
The federal government’s BSI-based Computer
Emergency Response Team CERT-Bund assumed
the role of a bot and for three weeks received
packages of stolen access data from the control and
command servers. This enabled BSI to identify
over 200,000 compromised e-mail accounts. CERTBund has informed the various network operators about the compromised e-mail accounts. The
malware’s capabilities, coupled with the immediate exploitation of the stolen access data to send
spam indicate a technically and organisationally
sophisticated attack on German users.

30

Method
First the victim’s PC gets infected with malware.
The next time the victim logs on for online banking the malware manipulates the banks website
and requests information on the victim’s mobile
telephone. The victim then receives a text message containing a link to an app infected with
iBanking malware and is induced via social engineering to install this app on his or her smartphone. The attack on the online banking service
involves interaction between the malware on the
PC and the smartphone. The malware on the PC
initiates its own money transfer. The mTAN sent
by the bank to the client’s mobile phone is intercepted there by iBanking malware and transmitted to the infected PC. The malware then uses the
intercepted mTAN to complete the credit transfer
on the PC.
Impact
The attackers were able to compromise the online
banking services of various international banks.
The malware can relatively easily be adapted for
attacks on other Internet services. For example,
variants of iBanking have already been discovered
which facilitate attacks on two-factor authentication (username or password + SMS code) for
Facebook and Gmail.
Target groups
The malware is used to attack bank clients who
use mTANs to do online banking.
Technical capabilities
The malware offers the attackers wide-ranging
opportunities to control smartphones: monitoring text messages, recording phone calls, acoustic
room surveillance, access to various data on the
smartphone, etc. All the information collected can
be transmitted to servers controlled by the attackers. In the iBanking package developers also offer
server software with which the infected devices
can be controlled. The malware’s functionality
reveals a high level of technical expertise on the
part of the developer, who has sold the software
under various different license models.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INCIDENTS

3.3

Incidents affecting business

Unlike the federal government, companies are not
currently required to report serious IT security
incidents to the BSI. The UP KRITIS initiative has
for many years given participating operators of
critical infrastructure the opportunity to share
information on incidents. In addition, together
with the Alliance for Cyber Security BSI offers
a reporting centre via which incidents can be
reported, anonymously if desired, which could be
relevant for other bodies or in connection with
which the reporter would like evaluation or assistance. The objective of the reporting centre is to
gain information on new attack techniques and
critical incidents with wider-ranging implications. The BSI analyses the reports and makes its
anonymised conclusions available to participants.
The aim of this procedure is to give companies
early notice of new attacks and possible preventive measures. To date the reporting centre
has been used predominantly by SMEs who
have fallen victim to DDos attacks or malware
infections.

3.3.1 APT attack on industrial installations
in Germany
Incident
Targeted attack on a steel mill in Germany
Method
The attackers used spear phishing e-mails in tandem with sophisticated social engineering to gain
initial access to the steel mill’s office network.
From there they worked their way progressively
into the production networks.
Impact
Breakdowns of individual control components or
entire installations proliferated. The breakdowns
led to the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace, leaving it in an undefined state and resulting
in massive damage.

3.3.2

Heartbleed: critical vulnerability in
widely used software library

Incident
The vulnerability known as Heartbleed, discovered in April 2014 in the OpenSSL software
library, permits the unauthorised access to the
program memory.
Method
All that is needed to exploit the vulnerability is to
send specially crafted queries to systems which
use the function affected by the OpenSSL vulnerability.
Impact
Virtually everyone on the Internet uses the Secure
Sockets Layer Protocol (SSL) or Transport Layer
Security (TLS), normally without even knowing
it. This very widely used technology is of great
importance for encrypted communication on the
Internet and is for example used on almost all
websites to check their authenticity and encrypt
communications between users and websites. The
OpenSSL free software library is often used for the
purpose. The Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL
permits unauthorised access to program memory.
This could include the usernames and passwords
entered by website visitors, and in rare cases it may
also be possible to read secret cryptographic keys.
This would mean that attackers could masquerade
as the service provider and read users’ supposedly
encrypted data transmissions.
Target groups
All products and services using the vulnerable
OpenSSL software library function were affected.
Major online services, social networks, bank
websites and federal government servers were all
affected by the vulnerability. Given the extent of
the vulnerability it must be assumed that, despite
the availability of patches, there continue to be
systems in Germany which are still vulnerable to
Heartbleed.

Target groups
Operators of industrial installations
Technical capabilities
The attackers’ technical skills can be rated as very
advanced. A variety of different internal systems
and industrial components were compromised.
The attackers’ expertise extended not just to classical IT security but also to detailed technical
knowledge of the Industrial Control Systems and
production processes being used.

31

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INCIDENTS

3.3.3

Dragonfly: targeted attacks
on production networks

Incident
The Dragonfly group (also known as ‘Energetic
Bear’) used the malware Havex, which was detected
in 2014, to attack several dozen German companies.
Method
The attack campaign made use of a new attack
method: in the first stage the criminals attacked
the manufacturers of industrial control system
software. The malware Havex was attached to the
relevant installation files on the vendors’ download servers, meaning that customers who installed
the legitimate software simultaneously downloaded the malware onto their systems. In some
cases a module was downloaded which collected
information on devices and systems used in
the production network and passed it on to the
attackers.
Impact
Havex facilitated the targeted use of malware in
Industrial Control Systems in order to collect information. It must be assumed that the criminals
then used this information to launch further
attacks. In collaboration with the Federal Criminal Police Office the BSI informed several dozen
companies in Germany which had fallen victim
to the Dragonfly campaign.
Target groups
Production facilities and production networks
Technical capabilities
The skills which became apparent during the
Dragonfly attack campaign, for example the targeted compromising of download servers, highlighted the attackers’ technical sophistication and
demonstrated that attacks on Industrial Control
Systems in Germany are a reality.

3.3.4

Operation Windigo: Linux malware
Ebury collects SSH access data

Incident
Ebury is malware with back-door functionality.
It is a rootkit for Linux and Unix-like operating
systems which intercepts Secure Shell (SSH)
credentials.
Method
The malware is installed by attackers on compromised servers either by exchanging SSH program
files or a library used commonly by these programs.
Ebury steals access data from infected systems
(usernames and passwords) to incoming and outgoing SSH connections and transmits the data
to the attackers. In addition the private SSH keys
used for outgoing SSH connections were stolen
from the compromised systems.
Impact
The back-door gives the criminals full control over
the infected system at all times. Servers infected
with Ebury were used by the criminals for various
criminal activities making up ‘Operation Windigo’.
For instance, web servers were manipulated so
that visitors were redirected from the websites
hosted there to other servers. These involved
either dating portals, websites with pornographic
content or servers hosting drive-by exploits which
infected the website visitors’ computers with malware. Our analysis revealed that several hundred
thousand such redirections were taking place
every day. On other systems the criminals used
the access data stolen using Ebury to install malware for sending spam. During the monitoring
period an average of 35 millions spam e-mails
were sent every day.
Target groups
Server operators (primarily) and Internet users
(secondarily)
Technical capabilities
Ebury is of high technical quality and the infrastructure created on the compromised servers
is professionally organised. The criminals made
huge profits from distributing the malware via
drive-by exploits, redirection from websites and
sending spam. CERT-Bund joined the ‘Ebury
Working Group’, an international association of
security analysts which has detected some 30,000
servers infected worldwide with Ebury since February 2013. About ten per cent of these servers are
located in Germany. CERT-Bund regularly notifies
German hosting providers and national CERTs in
over 60 countries of known Ebury infections.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | INCIDENTS

3.3.5

Great Britain: bankruptcy due to
cyber extortion and sabotage

Incident
In June 2014 the collaboration and development
platform for software developers operated by
the company Code Spaces became the target for
extortion accompanied by a DDos attack lasting
over 48 hours.
Method
The criminals gained illegal access to an administrator account for cloud storage rented by the
company from Amazon Web Services and placed
several messages there demanding money. The
criminals were clearly prepared for Code Spaces’
fruitless attempt to change the access data.
Impact
After the company refused to pay the money
demanded, the criminals began indiscriminately
deleting data. As a result the company lost virtually all its data, backups and machine settings, and
in the end the company, which had been trading
successfully for seven years, was forced to discontinue operations. There are no plans to reactivate
the business because the financial cost of restoration measures and paying compensation to clients
is too great.
Target groups
The attack illustrates the fundamental risk of a
company collapsing due to cyberspace extortion
and sabotage as well as from the outsourcing of
business-critical services.

3.3.6

ShellShock: vulnerability in the
Bash command line interpreter

Incident
In September 2014 a vulnerability dubbed Shell
Shock was published in the Bash command line
interpreter. Bash allowed the propagation to a
shell not only of environmental variables but also
functions. The function name is transmitted to the
shell as an environmental variable, followed by the
function definition. The vulnerability allowed
an attached program code to be executed in the
function definition.
Method
Bash is a standard component which is correspondingly widely distributed. It is used for such
things as system services and remote access to
both web and mail servers and also some smartphones. There is a correspondingly wide range
of scenarios whereby the vulnerability can be
exploited to executed unauthorised program code
on affected IT systems. If services linked over the
Internet are affected by ShellShock the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
Impact
The unauthorised execution of program code,
in some cases with administrator rights, allowed
attackers to access confidential information and
manipulate or crash IT systems. Malware has
been detected which uses the vulnerability to put
IT systems out of action. CVSS, the recognised
industry standard for evaluating the severity of
vulnerabilities, has given ShellShock its top score
of 10.
Target groups
Bash is the standard shell for most Linux distributions and is also installed on many other systems.
Also affected are the Apple operating system OS X
and various Industrial Control Systems. It must
be assumed that at the time it became known
there were vulnerable systems in virtually every
institution.

3.4

Incidents affecting critical
infrastructure

3.4.1 Social engineering at large companies
Incident
In May 2014 high-ranking employees of several
internationally operating large companies were
targeted by particularly sophisticated phishing
e-mails.
Method
Bogus e-mails informed the employees that, due
to an update of the personnel department’s IT
systems it was suspected that there could be inconsistencies in some data sets. On this pretext
the recipients were asked to send a copy of their
ofcial photo ID and the details of the bank
account into which their salaries were paid. The
e-mails were in virtually perfect German or English and came complete with a full mail history
plus e-mail headers featuring authentic company
e-mail addresses designed to lend apparent legitimacy to the process. A noteworthy point was
that the employees mentioned in the fake history
were actually employed in the various personnel
departments.
Impact
Some of the recipients took the e-mail to be authentic and transmitted the requested document copies
and account details to the sender, whereupon the
attackers closed the victim’s bank accounts by
post, using counterfeit signatures or ordered new
electronic cash cards and PINs to be sent to a new
address in China.
Target groups
Senior employees of major German companies.
Technical capabilities
The expense and effort involved in planning and
researching an attack of this kind is estimated
to be very high, so it must be assumed that the
attackers are extremely experienced. The near
perfect German used is noteworthy, being a feature which distinguishes this attack from many
others of this type.

34

3.4.2 Austria: malfunction in the
controlling of energy grids
Incident
In 2013 anomalies were detected in the data
streams in several Austrian control networks for
the management of energy grids. These caused
malfunctions for grid and power station operators
as well as a number of data transmission disruptions.
Method
It is suspected that the malfunction was triggered
by a command during commissioning a gas grid
operator in southern Germany which also extended to the Austrian energy grid. This was then
passed on to various different operators. Due to
the unspecified processing of this message in individual network components the command was
sent as an infinite loop, thereby triggering serious
disruption of the grid management control.
Impact
During the incident the grid’s stability could only
be maintained at great expense. During the disruption considerable volumes of data were created,
leading to log data overflows. Accordingly it has not
yet been possible to finally determine the cause
of the incident.
Target group
Energy grid operators

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SOLUTIONS

4 Solutions
Solutions for improving the risk situation in cyberspace must focus on the development of measures
designed for specific target groups, as well as supporting both businesses and private individuals in
protecting themselves. A key feature of these measures must be scalability in order to be able to select
appropriate measures to protect everyone from individuals to large organisations. From the aforementioned security threats and challenges posed by the
current IT landscape the following spheres of action
may be derived:

4.1

Promoting expertise and
trustworthiness in the field
of IT security

A key requirement for guaranteeing information
security is the deployment of effective and reliable security mechanisms on a technical level,
because despite thorough reviews and examinations, manipulation of IT components cannot
be entirely ruled out. Accordingly, promoting the
provision of thrustworthy information technology is a central pillar in ensuring a high level of
IT security in Germany. This is also significant in
light of the recent debate on the cyber activities
of foreign intelligence agencies.
Essentially, cooperative efforts of the government,
business and research communities should focus
on the following strategic objectives:
∙ Protecting fundamental values in the digital
world by safeguarding our technological capacity
to act and promoting trustworthy information
technology.
∙ Creating market conditions and incentives conducive to persuading foreign market leaders to
adapt their products at technical level via trust
anchors (such as national cryptocomponents) to
German trustworthiness expectations, in particular where security requirements are high.
∙ Empowering the German economy to combine
its core industrial skills with the existing expertise
in Germany in the field of information security in
order to ensure the implementation of the necessary IT security standards in central economic
sectors.
Among the key success factors are the development of sustainable business models designed to
ensure the long-term market success of these

products. IT security can be an important factor
in carving out a strong competitive position in
the major markets of the future. One example of a
technology of this sort, designed and promoted by
the BSI, is the SINA product family. SINA provides IT-supported ‘secure stations’ which permit
the risk-free use of market leaders’ applications
despite a deficit of trust.
German e-mail providers have joined forces for
a campaign promoting a trustworthy e-mail
service – ‘E-mail Made in Germany’. Initiatives like
this can be supported by standardising suitable
security and trustworthiness requirements and
awarding a corresponding certificate.
In the fast-moving IT world even the most up-todate activities must always keep one eye on the
future. For instance, there is a need for stronger
security mechanisms to be integrated into smartphones given the prospect of them being more
intensively used for payment and money transfer
purposes in the future. A key requirement for
guaranteeing information security is the deployment of effective and reliable security mechanisms at technical level. Fields not yet embraced
by this report, such as e-health, smart cities and
automotive with partial reference to safety (safety
of life and limb) may in future be subject to
higher security requirements. Further challenges
in prospect are crypto- and cyber technologies,
cloud solutions, security technologies to protect
Industrial Control Systems and the development
of intelligent networks (SDN).

4.2

Commitment to standardisation
and certification

Standardisation and certification are effective
tools for increasing transparency in the field of
information security, raising the trustworthiness of
products and services and forcing up information
security levels throughout the economy. In the
field of IT security Germany already possesses
an effective certification scheme and internationally renowned auditing bodies.
Despite this, redoubled efforts will be called for
in order to successfully safeguard Germany’s
leading position and confront new technological
challenges. Currently there are shortcomings
in Germany’s representation on international
standardisation bodies. Leading information and

37

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SOLUTIONS

communication technology companies frequently
attempt to impose their own proprietary standards on international standardisation committees in order to gain a competitive advantage. This
results in security standards which often fall far
short of what is advisable from an information
technology viewpoint.
Accordingly there needs to be stronger coordination of industry and government commitment
to IT standardisation, with special reference to
IT security and particular focus on technological
transparency and the application of open
standards.
The federal government is already actively working on the specification of IT security standards,
for instance in the form of technical guidelines
and BSI standards, in fields where security is critical, with a view to promoting the development
of national best-practice solutions. For instance,
the BSI is assisting in the implementation of the
German Energy Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz)
by cooperating with measurement system manufactures in the energy industry on the development of protection profiles and technical guidelines for intelligent measurement systems on the
smart grid of the future. These technical standards
are being developed in collaboration with the
entire industry and are embodied in the VDE/FNN
requirements for the Measurement System 2020.
Current market analyses forecast that demand
for services to defend against cyber attacks is set
to grow further. In view of the likely establishment of national cyber security service providers
it makes sense to put in place a system for the
certification of the companies in question as proof
of their expertise and trustworthiness. In certain
fields such as information security auditing,
advice and penetration testing the BSI is already
certifying service providers.
In the manufacturing sector there is a need for an
increased involvement in the important OPC UA
industry standard (a central protocol in connection with Industry 4.0), one of the key future fields
in enabling German industry to position itself
both as user and provider. The BSI is working
together with a leading sectoral association on
standards for secure data transmission.

38

4.3

Promoting IT security in
society and the widespread
use of secure technologies

A vital requirement for the effective use of security technology is raising users’ awareness of IT
threats. All users are responsible for their own IT
and must therefore also take responsibility for
security measures. Only by acting on their own
initiative users can protect themselves from some
of the threats discussed in chapter 2. In its capacity as the national IT security agency the BSI
provides a range of support for the various target
groups.20
Another key requirement for increasing IT security in Germany is the use of more secure and
more reliable technologies. From an information
technology viewpoint the development, provision
and universal application of trustworthy crypto
and cyber technologies for all target groups is
of decisive importance in order to minimise the
risks posed by critical security threats.
To this end it will be essential to provide scalable
cyber security options which facilitate the provision of levels of protection adjusted to the specific
needs of the target group in question. Given that
over 80 per cent of all cyber threats can be warded
off simply by taking basic security measures, it is
necessary to make basic technologies available to
private individuals and SMEs, thereby allowing
them to contribute to enhancing cyber security.
In this connection it will also be necessary to provide overall solutions which, in conjunction with
crypto- and cyber security mechanisms, provide
protection against threats at different levels.
Through the structural options it has implemented,
for instance in the shape of De-Mail, the federal
government has for the first time created a universal public key infrastructure in Germany. The
solution will in future support both transport
encryption and end-to-end encryption. Currently
over 90 per cent of all e-mails are transmitted in
unencrypted form. Furthermore, the two-factorauthentication process means that De-Mail offers
security mechanisms against identity theft, which
is often successful due to the fact that many
providers use the standard software-supported
password procedure.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | SOLUTIONS

Another indirect promotion of IT security in
society is the continuous security analysis of universally used open-source IT security and cryptolibraries as well as the ongoing development
and maintenance of their security. This allows
vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed, with its widespread impact, to be virtually eradicated and
brings about a sustained improvement in the
security characteristics of these software libraries.
In this context the business world has a responsibility to come up with IT security solutions.
Providers could make easy-to-operate IT security
solutions available to their customers across the
board. A key success factor here would be the
virtually complete automation of the process of
setting up security functionality. Online providers too could provide individuals with greater
protection, for instance by introducing multifactor authentication systems to protect them
from identity theft.
However, the business world too can fall victim
to cyber attacks, particularly in the form of cyberespionage. Accordingly, mechanisms need to be
developed and universally applied which will
provide adequate protection against high-grade
forms of attack such as Advanced Persistent
Threats (APTs). To this end, close collaboration
between government, business and science are
called for in order to allow the earliest possible
detection of attacks and attack forms and compile a joint situation assessment and share this
knowledge, including defence mechanisms, as
it already happens in the CERT association.
Another central cooperation platform for government and industry is the Alliance for Cyber
Security, which around 1,000 companies and
institutions have now joined and which has come
up with 180 concrete recommendations. The
development of such voluntary models is vital to
ensuring the rapid sharing of information faced
with a world of dynamically changing technology
and circumstances in order to quickly come up
with pragmatic security solutions and defensive
measures.
Our current knowledge of ICS attacks, with Stuxnet
being the starting point, have put the spotlight
on the security of Industrial Control Systems and
indicates that greater attention will have to be
devoted to this issue in future. In order to tackle
this threat the following measures in particular
must be addressed:

∙ Increased attention to Industrial Control Systems security by Computer Emergency Response
Teams (CERTs).
∙ The development of security profiles specially
tailored to Industrial Control Systems at both
system and product levels as well as the devising
of technology-specific minimum standards.
∙ More intense analysis of attacks on clouds and
development of security standards and measures.

4.4

Guaranteeing critical infrastructure protection

Operators of critical infrastructure have a duty to
maintain minimum IT security standards due to
the potentially far-reaching societal consequences
of a breakdown or failure of infrastructure provision and their consequent responsibility for the
common good.
The federal government maintains especially
close relationships with these operators. In 2007
the UP KRITIS association was formed as a cooperation between the government and the critical
infrastructure industry.
In light of the developing security threats since
2011 there is a need to further strengthen the
working relationship between the government
and critical infrastructure operators. UP KRITIS
has been upgraded in terms of content and structure, allowing it to become significantly more
deeply involved in the critical infrastructure sector. The IT security bill drawn up by the Federal
Ministry of the Interior provides among other
things for minimum standards and reporting
duties to which operators of critical infrastructure should be subject. These reports will be used
to compile a situation assessment which will
be made available to the companies concerned.
Simultaneously the reported incidents can be
used as the basis for reinforcing and optimising
the support and advice provided for companies
by the BSI. That way the BSI will be in a position
to provide critical infrastructure operators with
more effective support in the event of an IT
security incident.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | GLOSSARY AND LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS

5 Glossary and list of abbreviations
Advanced Persistent Threats
Advanced persistent threats (APT) are targeted cyber attacks on
selected institutions in which the attackers gain persistent longterm access to the victim network and then widen the attack to
additional systems. The attacks involve the deployment of major
resources and considerable technical skill on the attackers’ part
and are generally difficult to detect.
Adware
Adware are programs which finance themselves via advertising.
Malware programs which serve advertising purposes are also
described as adware. When adware is downloaded programs are
generally installed which perform espionage functions. In most
cases you are notified of this in the license and conditions of use.
Application/app
An application, or app for short, is a piece of user software. The
term is frequently used in connection with applications for smartphones or tablets.
Attack vector
Attack vector denotes the combination of attack routes and
techniques whereby the attacker gains access to IT systems.
Bot & botnet
A botnet is a collection of computer systems which have been
attacked by a remotely controllable malware program known as
a bot. The affected systems are controlled by the botnet operator
via a command-and-control server (C&C server).
Bring Your Own Device
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) denotes the use of private devices
for professional purposes and their integration into company
networks.
CERT/Computer Emergency Response Team
Computer emergency team made up of IT specialists. Many
companies and institutions have now established CERTs to take
care of defending against cyber attacks and preventing IT security
incidents and responding to them should they happen.
CERT-Bund
CERT-Bund (Computer Emergency Response Team of the Federal
Government) is a unit of BSI which functions as the central coordinating body for the government department for both preventive and reactive measures in relation to security-related incidents
affecting computer systems.
CERT Association (CERT-Verbund)
The German CERT Association is an alliance of several German
CERTs at companies and in government departments.

40

Bürger-CERT
The Bürger-CERT (see CERT/Computer Emergency Response
Team) of the BSI (www.buerger-cert.de) warns citizens and SMEs
rapidly and expertly about malware and vulnerabilities in computer applications and provides information on security updates.
Cloud/cloud computing
Cloud computing refers to offering, using and charging for IT
services over the Internet. The services provided can be rapidly
adapted to changing needs. These services are offered and used
exclusively via defined interfaces and protocols. The range of
services offered under cloud computing embraces the entire
spectrum of information technology, including infrastructure
(e.g. computing power, memory), platforms and software.
Command-and-control server
See ‘Bot & botnet’.
Critical infrastructure/KRITIS
Critical infrastructure means institutions and enterprises of
particular importance for the common good of a country whose
breakdown or impairment would lead to long-term supply
bottlenecks, significant disruption of public security or other
dramatic consequences.
Critical infrastructure sectors
Currently, nine sectors in Germany have been defined as critical
infrastructure: Transport and traffic, Energy, Information technology and telecommunication, Finance and insurance industries,
Government and public administration, Nutrition, Water, Health,
Media and culture.
DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) assigns the names used on
the Internet, such as www.bsi.bund.de, and the associated IP
addresses.
Dos & DDos attacks
Denial of service (Dos) attacks are directed at the availability of
services, websites, individual systems or entire networks. If such
an attack is launched in parallel by several systems this is known
as a distributed denial of service (DDos) attack. DDos attacks
frequently involve very large numbers of computers or servers.
Drive-by download/drive-by exploits
Drive-by exploits involve the automated exploitation of vulnerabilities. When a PC user visits a website infected with drive-by
exploit vulnerabilities in the Web browser, in browser plug-ins or
in the operating system are exploited in order to install malware
undetected on the PC without any interaction on the users’ part.

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | GLOSSARY AND LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS

End-to-end encryption
To send particularly sensitive information securely by e-mail both
the transport channel and the e-mail content can be encrypted.
To use end-to-end encryption both the sender and the recipient
require encryption software suitable for the message which must
be installed on both computers.
Exploit kit
Exploit kits (aka exploit packs) are tools for cyber attacks which
are placed on legitimate websites. A variety of different exploits
are used in an automated attempt to detect and exploit a vulnerability in a Web browser or plug-in in order to to install malware.
ICT
Short for ‘Information and communication technology’. This
refers to the entirety of information technology, communication
technology and their interactions, for instance in the form of
communication networks.

Log data & log file
A log file contains the record of actions and processes on a
computer.
NTP
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) performs the time synchronisation of IT systems in networks.
NTP reflection
This is a specific kind of DDos attack. In a reflection attack the
victim’s system is not directly attacked. Instead the attacker operates via reflection, sending a simple query carrying the falsified
sender address of the victim’s system to the target system. Due to
the falsified address the answer to the attacker’s query is then sent
not to the attacker’s system but to the victim’s. The answer to the
query will be significantly larger than the query itself, and as a
result the attacker is able to generate a lot of attack bandwidth
without expending much of their own bandwidth. We refer to this
as the amplification of the bandwidth used.

Identity theft
Identity theft or misuse involves the acquisition and unauthorised use by third parties of personal data such as postal and e-mail
addresses, dates of birth, bank account or credit card numbers.
The attackers’ aim is generally to gain a financial advantage using
the confidential information, or more rarely to discredit the person whose details have been stolen. Identity theft is chiefly done
via social engineering, malware on infected systems or data theft
after hacking of online services.
Industrial Control System (ICS)
Systems for automating production process are known as
Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

OpenSSL
OpenSSL is a free software library which implements encryption
protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Patch/patch management
A patch is a software package which software manufacturers create
in order to eradicate vulnerabilities in their programs, or make
other improvements. Many programs offer an automated update
function to facilitate the downloading of these updates. Patch
management refers to processes and procedures to ensure that an
IT system receives available patches as quickly as possible.
Penetration test
A penetration test is a controlled attempt to infiltrate a given computer system or network in order to try and identify vulnerabil-

Industry 4.0
Industry 4.0 is an umbrella term for the merging of the real and
virtual worlds into an Internet of things, with the focus on the
future shape of industrial production and logistics. It will involve
the interconnection of systems right across a business, both internally and externally: machines, sensors, production facilities,
marketing, sales, procurement and logistics.

ities. For the purpose the same or similar techniques are deployed
as would be used in a real attack. Their aim is to assess the prospect
of a real attack succeeding, thereby assessing the efficacy of the
existing security measures and determining whether there is a
need for additional security measures.

Internet of things
By Internet of things we mean the linking up of clearly identifiable physical objects with their virtual representations in an
Internet-like structure via an embedded electronic chip.

Phishing
The term ‘phishing’ is a blend of the words ‘password’ and
‘fishing’, i.e. going fishing for passwords. The attacker attempts
via bogus websites, e-mails or text messages to extract personal
data from an Internet user and thus commit identity theft.

IS audit
Information security audits are a key component of any successful information security management system. Only regular checks
on established security systems and information security processes can ensure their effective implementation, up-to-dateness,
completeness and appropriateness, and therefore the current
state of your information security. The IS audit is thus a tool for
determining, achieving and maintaining an acceptable level of
security in an institution.

Plug-in
A plug-in is an extra piece of software or a software module which
can be integrated into a computer program in order to extend its
functionality.

41

THE STATE OF IT SECURITY IN GERMANY 2014 | GLOSSARY AND LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS

Ransomware
Ransomware is malware, with the help of which an attacker
prevents access to or the use of data or entire computer systems.

Twitter
Twitter is a real-time digital application for sending short
messages.

The usual purpose of this is to extort money (the ‘ransom’).
Shell
A shell is software which functions as the interface between
people and a machine. In normal usage the word shell has come
to mean both the command line interpreter and graphic user
interfaces such as Windows Explorer or the Apple Finder.
Social Engineering
In cyber attacks using social engineering criminals attempt to
induce their victims to disclose data of their own free will, circumvent protective measures and willingly install malicious code
on their systems. Just like in the field of espionage, cybercriminals skilfully exploit human weaknesses such as curiosity to gain
access to sensitive data and information.
Spam
Spam is defined as unwanted messages sent en masse and in an
untargeted fashion via e-mail or other communication services.
In harmless variants spam messages generally contain unsolicited
advertising. However, spam often comes with attachments containing malware, links to infected websites or is used for phishing
attacks.
SSH
SSH stands for Secure Shell, an application allowing the establishment of an encrypted network connection to a remote device.
SSL/TLS
TLS stands for Transport Layer Security, an encryption protocol for
the secure transmission of data over the Internet. Its predecessor
was SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

42

UP KRITIS
UP KRITIS (www.upkritis.de) is a public-private collaborative initiative between critical infrastructure operators, their professional
associations and the relevant government agencies.
VDE
Stands for Verband der Elektrotechnik Elektronik Informationstechnik e. V. (Association for Electrical, Electronic & Information
Technologies).
Watering hole attacks
The analogy is to a watering hole which attracts prey animals
and is thus also frequented by their hunters. In this type of attack
websites which are highly likely to be visited by a target individual
are first hacked into and infected with malware. When people
then visit this website it automatically installs malware on their
computers, for instance via drive-by download.
Web browser
Web browsers are special computer programs for displaying websites on the World Wide Web or documents and data generally.
Zero-day exploits
Zero-day exploits make use of a vulnerability as soon as it has
been discovered by criminals. This leaves users and developers
very little time to take countermeasures.
