Executive Summary
LockBit 2.0 is ransomware as a service (RaaS) that first emerged in June 2021 as an
upgrade to its predecessor LockBit (aka ABCD Ransomware), which was first observed in
September 2019.
Since its inception, the LockBit 2.0 RaaS attracted affiliates via recruitment campaigns in
underground forums, and thus became particularly prolific during the third quarter of calendar
year 2021. The LockBit 2.0 operators claimed to have the fastest encryption software of any

1/24

active ransomware strain as of June 2021, claiming accordingly that this added to its
effectiveness and ability to disrupt the ransomware landscape.
While several top-tier RaaS affiliate programs, such as Babuk, DarkSide and REvil (aka
Sodinokibi) disappeared from the underground in 2021, LockBit 2.0 continued to operate and
gradually became one of the most active ransomware operations. While Conti was
recognized as being the most prolific ransomware deployed in 2021 per our 2022 Unit 42
Ransomware Threat Report, LockBit 2.0 is the most impactful and widely deployed
ransomware variant we have observed in all ransomware breaches during the first quarter of
2022, considering both leak site data and data from cases handled by Unit 42 incident
responders.
According to data analysis of ransomware groups’ dark web leak sites, LockBit 2.0 was the
most impactful RaaS for five consecutive months. As of May 25, LockBit 2.0 accounted for
46% of all ransomware-related breach events for 2022. And the LockBit 2.0 RaaS leak site
has the most significant number of published victims, with over 850 in total.
Additionally, LockBit 2.0 has affected many companies globally, with top victims based in the
U.S., Italy and Germany. Its most highly targeted industry verticals include professional
services, construction, wholesale and retail, and manufacturing.
Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections against LockBit 2.0 attacks from Cortex
XDR, as well as from the WildFire cloud-delivered security subscription for the NextGeneration Firewall. (Please see the Conclusion section for more detail.)

LockBit 2.0 Overview

2/24

LockBit 2.0 is another example of RaaS that leverages double extortion techniques as part of
the attack to pressure victims into paying the ransom.
In some cases, LockBit 2.0 operators have performed DDoS attacks on the victims'
infrastructure as well as using a leak site. This practice is known as triple extortion, a tactic
observed in groups like BlackCat, Avaddon and SunCrypt in the past.
Like other ransomware families such as BlackByte, LockBit 2.0 avoids systems that use
Eastern European languages, including many written with Cyrillic alphabets.
Unlike other RaaS programs that don't require the affiliates to be super technical or savvy,
LockBit 2.0 operators allegedly only work with experienced penetration testers, especially
those experienced with tools like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike. Affiliates are tasked with
gaining initial access to the victim network, allowing LockBit 2.0 to conduct the rest of the
attack.
LockBit 2.0 has been observed changing infected computers’ backgrounds to a ransomware
note. The ransomware note was also used to recruit insiders from victim organizations. The
notes claimed the threat actors would pay “millions of dollars” to insiders who provided
access to corporate networks or facilitated a ransomware infection by opening a phishing
email and/or launching a payload manually. The threat actors also expressed interest in
other access methods such as RDP, VPN and corporate email credentials. In exchange, they
offer a cut of the paid ransom.

Victimology
LockBit 2.0 targets organizations opportunistically. The operators work with initial access
brokers to save time and allow for a larger profit potential. While typically seeking victims of
opportunity, LockBit 2.0 does appear to have victim limitations. The group announced that
they would not target healthcare facilities, social services, educational institutions, charitable
organizations and other organizations that “contribute to the survival of the human race”.
However, despite these claims, there have been instances of affiliates undermining these
guidelines by still opting to attack industry verticals such as healthcare and education.
Organizations in Europe and the U.S. are hit more often by LockBit 2.0 than those in other
countries, likely due to the high profitability and insurance payouts.

Leak Site Data
During the first calendar year quarter of 2022, LockBit 2.0 persisted as the most impactful
and the most deployed ransomware variant we observed in all ransomware breaches shared
on leak sites.

3/24

Figure 1. Ransomware leak site data from the first calendar year quarter of 2022.
According to leak site data analysis, LockBit 2.0 was the most impactful RaaS for five
consecutive months. As of May 25, LockBit 2.0 accounted for 46% of all ransomware-related
breach events for 2022 shared on leak sites.
Additionally, the LockBit 2.0 RaaS leak site has the most significant number of published
victims, with over 850 in total. The site itself typically features information such as victim
domains, a time tracker and measures of how much data was compromised.

Figure 5. LockBit 2.0 impacted industry vertical chart.
When looking at leak site data across all ransomware families, we’ve observed LockBit 2.0
targeting the highest number of organizations in the following regions: JAPAC, EMEA, and
LATAM.

Unit 42 Incident Response Data on LockBit 2.0
Cases handled by Unit 42 security consultants involving LockBit 2.0 since its appearance in
June 2021 demonstrate shorter dwell times and less flexibility in negotiation in the beginning
of FY 2022 (measured October-September) in comparison to the end of FY 2021. The
following data is broken into fiscal years and quarters based on when the threat actor
breached the network, not when the activity was noticed by a client.
LockBit 2.0 has shown a decrease in dwell time in FY 2022. From the last two quarters of FY
2021 to the first two quarters of FY 2022, there has been an average 37-day difference.

7/24

Figure 6. LockBit 2.0 average dwell time by fiscal quarter.
The difference in initial and final ransom demands over the past fiscal year has been
converted to percentages and then averaged. The graph below demonstrates that at the end
of FY 2021, threat actors using LockBit 2.0 were much more open to negotiations of ransom
amounts; during that time the ransom was dropped approximately 83% from the initial ask on
average. In comparison, we see less flexibility in FY 2022 Q1 and Q3 – threat actors only
offered an average of about 30% as a price drop. FY 2022 Q2 is not included due to lack of
sufficient information.

LockBit 2.0 Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
Technically speaking, we have observed LockBit 2.0 affiliates leveraging the following tactics,
techniques and procedures:
TA0001 Initial
Access
T1078 Valid
Accounts

Credentials that have either been reused across multiple platforms
or have previously been exposed. Additionally, this includes VPN
accounts – not just domain and local accounts.

T1133 External
Remote Services

Affiliates have been seen brute forcing exposed RDP services and
compromising accounts with weak passwords.

T1190 Exploit PublicFacing Applications

Vulnerabilities such as ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473) and

LockBit 2.0 enumerates system information such as hostname,
shares, and domain information.

T1614 System
Location Discovery

Attempts to check the language settings.

TA00008 Lateral
Movement
T1021 Remote
Services

Although Cobalt Strike has many capabilities beneficial to threat
actors in ransomware attacks, it was mainly seen in LockBit 2.0
investigations acting as a command and control beacon, a method
of lateral movement and a tool for downloading/executing files.

11/24

T1021.002 Remote
Services:
SMB/Windows
Admin Shares

LockBit 2.0 has been known to self-propagate via SMB.

TA0010 Exfiltration

over C2 Channel

MEGASync is the leading way for LockBit 2.0 affiliates to exfiltrate
data from clients with it being occasionally replaced by RClone.

TA0011 Command
and Control
T1219 Remote
Access Software

AnyDesk has been the most common legitimate desktop software
used to establish an interactive command and control channel, with
ConnectWise seen slightly less frequently.

TA0040 Impact
T1486 Data
Encrypted for Impact

LockBit 2.0 is known for its extortion tactics, encrypting devices
and demanding a ransom.

T1489 Service Stop

During the defense evasion phase, anti-malware and monitoring
software is often disabled. Firewall rules have occasionally been
seen being disabled as well.

LockBit 2.0 Technical Details
LockBit 2.0 was developed using the Assembly and Origin C programming languages and
leverages advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)
algorithms to encrypt victim data. It can affect both Windows and Linux OS, as the operator
released a Linux version of LockBit 2.0 to target VMware ESXi hypervisor systems in
October 2021, coded exclusively in the C programming language.
The LockBit group claimed that LockBit 2.0 is “the fastest encryption software all over the
world” and provided a comparative table showing the encryption speed of various
ransomware samples.

12/24

Figure 8. LockBit encryption comparative table | Source: LockBit blog.
LockBit 2.0 also contains a self-spreading feature, clears logs and can print the ransom note
on network printers until the paper runs out.
A management panel that affiliates can use to manage victims and affiliate accounts,
generate new ransomware builds and generate the decryptor if the demanded ransom is
paid also exists.

13/24

Figure 9. LockBit 2.0 management panel. Source: ProDaft.
LockBit 2.0 operators also released an information-stealer dubbed StealBit, which was
developed to support affiliates of the LockBit 2.0 RaaS when exfiltrating data from breached
companies.
StealBit contains the following capabilities:
Operates as a file grabber and dumps/uploads victim data to the LockBit victimshaming site.
No reliance on third-party cloud file-sharing services, where data can be easily
removed if the victim submitted a complaint.
The download speed is limited only by internet connection bandwidth, so it is possible
to clone folders from corporate networks and upload them to the LockBit victim
shaming blog quickly.
The operator of LockBit 2.0 has provided a comparative table speed showing the information
stealer compared to other tools.

Figure 10. LockBit 2.0 download speed, according to LockBit 2.0 operator.
14/24

LockBit 3.0
There was a bug that existed in LockBit 2.0 that allowed researchers to revert the encryption
process on an MSSQL database. After the bug’s disclosure, LockBit forum members
discussed how the bug will not exist in LockBit’s next iteration. Moreover, on March 17,
LockBit forum members mentioned the release of LockBit’s next version in one or two weeks.
On March 25, VX underground posted a tweet with details of this new version, dubbed
LockBit Black.

Conclusion
LockBit 2.0 and its evolution over time is a perfect example to illustrate the persistence,
increasing complexity and impact brought by the ransomware landscape as a whole. With
claims of this RaaS offering the fastest encryption on the ransomware market, coupled with
the fact that it has been delivered in high volume by experienced affiliates, this RaaS poses a
significant threat. LockBit’s continuation with operations and its next iteration coming up on
the horizon means that organizations and their security teams need to stay vigilant in the
ever-evolving threat landscape.
Palo Alto Networks detects and prevents LockBit 2.0 ransomware in the following ways:
WildFire: All known samples are identified as malware.
Cortex XDR:
Identifies indicators associated with LockBit 2.0.
Anti-Ransomware Module to detect LockBit 2.0 encryption behaviors on
Windows.
Local Analysis detection for LockBit 2.0 binaries on Windows.
Next-Generation Firewalls: DNS Signatures detect the known C2 domains, which are
also categorized as malware in Advanced URL Filtering.

Appendix A
In August 2021, a Russian blogger published a 22-minute interview with an alleged
representative of the group behind LockBit 2.0 called “LockBitSupp” on a YouTube channel
called “Russian-language open source intelligence (OSINT).” The same Russian blogger
22/24

previously published interviews with a representative of the group behind the REvil
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), hackers and security experts.
Some key takeaways from the claims made in the interview were:
The LockBit 2.0 threat actor claimed the group’s RaaS was unlikely to be rebranded
since the team allegedly was a business that was honest with their customers –
suggesting a supposed contrast between LockBit 2.0 and Avaddon, DarkSide and
REvil affiliates.
The LockBit 2.0 ransomware disregarded keyboard layout, but it allegedly would not
run on a host where the system language was set to any of the languages spoken in
the Commonwealth of Independent States region.
The group did not devise attacks on companies of their choice; they simply worked with
initial access to any corporate network they obtained elsewhere, since this was more
profitable and saved time. The team selected targets for ransomware attacks based on
the company’s finances — the bigger, the better. The location also did not matter.
However, team members allegedly did not attack healthcare facilities, social services,
educational institutions and charitable organizations or any other organization that
“contributed to the survival of the human race.” [Note that Unit 42 case data does
include indications that threat actors using LockBit 2.0 have targeted healthcare
organizations at times.]
The threat actor claimed that the largest number of victims who paid ransom were
company representatives who did not care about creating backup copies and did not
protect their sensitive data. According to the threat actor’s claims, companies that
violated regulations about collecting and handling customer or user personal
information were among those eager to pay. The threat actor claimed that there
generally were only a few companies who refused to pay ransom on principle, while
most of the victims evaluated profit and loss to decide whether or not to pay a ransom.
LockBit 2.0 operators allegedly almost always offered discounts to their victims since
the goal was to streamline attacks.
The threat actor claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated ransomware attacks
significantly, saying it was easy to compromise home computers of employees who
work remotely and use them as a springboard to access other networked systems.
Companies in Europe and the U.S. were hit with ransomware much more often than
companies based in other countries allegedly because of high profit and insurance and
not because of language barriers.
Ransomware operators usually recruit negotiators, who coerce victims to pay ransom,
since professional penetration testers allegedly lack the time for chatter.
