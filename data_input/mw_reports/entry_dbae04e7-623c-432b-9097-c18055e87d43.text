Max Heinemeyer, Director of Threat Hunting

Executive summary
Darktrace detected several highly targeted attacks in early March, well before any
associated signatures had become available. Two weeks later, the attacks were
attributed to Chinese threat-actor APT41.
APT41 exploited the Zoho ManageEngine zero-day vulnerability CVE-2020-10189.
Darktrace automatically detected and reported on the attack in its earliest stages,
enabling customers to contain the threat before it could make an impact.
The intrusions described here were part of a wider campaign by APT41 aiming to gain
initial access to as many companies as possible during the window of opportunity
presented by CVE-2020-10189.
The reports generated by Darktrace highlighted and delineated every aspect of the
incident in the form of a meaningful security narrative. Even a junior responder could
have reviewed this output and acted on this zero-day APT attack in under 5 minutes.

Fighting APT41’s global attack

1/7

In early March, Darktrace detected several advanced attacks targeting customers in the US
and Europe. A majority of these customers are in the legal sector. The attacks shared the
same Techniques, Tools & Procedures (TTPs), targeting public-facing servers and exploiting
recent high-impact vulnerabilities. Last week, FireEye attributed this suspicious activity to the
Chinese cyber espionage group APT41.
This campaign used the Zoho ManageEngine zero-day vulnerability CVE-2020-10189 to get
access to various companies, but little to no follow-up was detected after initial intrusion. This
activity indicates a broad-brush campaign to get initial access to as many target companies
as possible during the zero-day window of opportunity.
The malicious activity observed by Darktrace took place late on Sunday March 8, 2020 and
in the morning of March 9, 2020 (UTC), broadly in line with office hours previously attributed
to the Chinese cyber espionage group APT41.
The graphic below shows an exemplary timeline from one of the customers targeted by
APT41. The attacks observed in other customer environments are identical.

Technical analysis
The attack described here centered around the Zoho ManageEngine zero-day vulnerability
CVE-2020-10189. Most of the attack appears to have been automated.
We observed the initial intrusion, several follow-up payload downloads, and command and
control (C2) traffic. In all cases, the activity was contained before any later steps in the attack
lifecycle, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration, were identified.
The below screenshot shows an overview of the key AI Analyst detections reported. Not only
did it report on the SSL and HTTP C2 traffic, but it also reported on the payload downloads:

Initial compromise
The initial compromise began with the successful exploitation of the Zoho ManageEngine
zero-day vulnerability CVE-2020-10189. Following the initial intrusion, the Microsoft
BITSAdmin command line tool was used to fetch and install a malicious Batch file, described
below:

install.bat (MD5: 7966c2c546b71e800397a67f942858d0) from infrastructure 66.42.98[.]220
on port 12345.
Source: 10.60.50.XX
Destination: 66.42.98[.]220
Destination Port: 12345
Content Type: application/x-msdownload
Protocol: HTTP
Host: 66.42.98[.]220
URI: /test/install.bat
Method: GET
Status Code: 200

Shortly after the initial compromise, the first stage Cobalt Strike Beacon LOADER was
downloaded.

Command and Control traffic
Interestingly, TeamViewer activity and the download of Notepad++ was taking place at the
same time as the C2 traffic was starting in some of the customer attacks. This indicates
APT41 trying to use familiar tools instead of completely ‘Living off the Land’.
Storesyncsvc.dll was a Cobalt Strike Beacon implant (trial-version) which connected to
exchange.dumb1[.]com. A successful DNS resolution to 74.82.201[.]8 was identified, which
Darktrace discerned as a successful SSL connection to a hostname with Dynamic DNS
properties.
Multiple connections to exchange.dumb1[.]com were identified as beaconing to a C2 center.
This C2 traffic to the initial Cobalt Strike Beacon was leveraged to download a second stage
payload.
Interestingly, TeamViewer activity and the download of Notepad++ was taking place at the
same time as the C2 traffic was starting in some of the customer attacks. This indicates
APT41 trying to use familiar tools instead of completely ‘Living off the Land’. There is at least
high certainty that the use of these two tools can be attributed to this intrusion instead of
regular business activity. Notepad++ was not normally used in the target customers’
environments, nor was TeamViewer – in fact, the use of both applications was 100% unusual
for the targeted organizations.

CertUtil.exe, a command line program installed as part of Certificate Services, was then
leveraged to connect externally and download the second stage payload.

A few hours after this executable download, the infected device made an outbound HTTP
connection requesting the URI /TzGG, which was identified as Meterpreter downloading
further shellcode for the Cobalt Strike Beacon.

No lateral movement or significant data exfiltration was observed.

How Cyber AI Analyst reported on the zero-day exploit
Darktrace not only detected this zero-day attack campaign, but Cyber AI Analyst also saved
security teams valuable time by investigating disparate security events and generating a
report that immediately put them in a position to take action.
The below screenshot shows the AI Analyst incidents reported in one infected environment,
over the eight days covering the intrusion period. The first incident on the left represents the
APT activity described here. The other five incidents are independent of the APT activity and
not as severe.
Figure 8: The security incidents surfaced by AI Analyst
AI Analyst reported on six incidents in total over the eight-day period. Each AI Analyst
incident includes a detailed timeline and summary of the incident, in a concise format that
takes an average of two minutes to review. This means that with Cyber AI Analyst, even a
non-technical person could have actioned a response to this sophisticated, zero-day incident
in less than five minutes.

Conclusion
While very sophisticated in nature, APT41 sacrificed stealth for speed by targeting many
companies at the same time. APT41 wanted to utilize the limited window of opportunity that
the Zoho zero-day provided before IT staff starts patching.
Without public Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) or any open-source intelligence available,
targeted attacks are incredibly difficult to detect. Moreover, even the best detections are
useless if they cannot be actioned by a security analyst at an early stage. Too often this
occurs because of an overwhelming volume of alerts, or simply because the skills barrier to
triage and investigation is too high.
4/7

This appears to be a broad campaign by APT41 to gain initial access to many different
companies and sectors. While very sophisticated in nature, APT41 sacrificed stealth for
speed by targeting many companies at the same time. APT41 wanted to utilize the limited
window of opportunity that the Zoho zero-day provided before IT staff starts patching.
Darktrace’s Cyber AI is specifically designed to detect the subtle signs of targeted, unknown
attacks at an early stage, without relying on prior knowledge or IoCs. It achieves this by
continuously learning the normal patterns of behavior for every user, device, and associated
peer group from scratch, and ‘on the job’.
In the face of APT41’s recent zero-day attack campaign, the AI’s ability to (a) detect
unknown threats with self-learning AI and (b) augment strained responders with AI-driven
investigations and reporting proved crucial. Indeed, it ensured that the attacks were swiftly
contained before escalating to the later stages of the attack lifecycle.
