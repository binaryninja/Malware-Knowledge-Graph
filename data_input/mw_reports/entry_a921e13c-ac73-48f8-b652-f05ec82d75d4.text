A new ransomware by the name of Voldemort(or Nagini) has appeared. It’s yet another
dangerous virus with a goofy exterior. The virus locks the screen of infected
computers and puts a picture of Lord Voldemort as a wallpaper. The virus doesn’t add
extensions to encrypted files.

Voldemort Ransomware Virus – What To Expecto?
The virus was discovered by Michael Gillespie. The virus was named after a few files
referencing Voldemort, the main villain of the Harry Potter franchise. One of the virus’s file
names is “Nagini.exe.” Another is named voldemort.horcrux.
Voldemort Ransomware is still in development as of now, but a finished version may be
released soon. The virus will most likely be distributed with the help of email spam (not owl
mail, sadly.) The virus is developed by someone called “Colosseum.” It’s unknown is it’s a
single person or a group of malware developers.

Voldemort Ransomware – Technical details
The Voldemort virus uses a strong RSA encryption algorithm. The ransomware includes
instructions to its victims. The message reads:
1/6

Done Encrypting!
Enter your credit card:
Get key!
Enter key to decrypt the files:
Decrypt Now!
Voldemort ransomware aims to encrypt specific files. The extensions targeted the virus are:
.bmp, .doc, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .pdf, .pptx, .xls, .xlsx, .exe
Once the victim PC is infected, Voldemort will create its files in the following directories:
C:\Temp\voldemort.horcrux
*Username*\1.exe
*Username*\Nagini.exe
The virus remains fairly mysterious as of now. There’s not a lot of data to go on since
Voldemort isn’t widely distributed yet.

Voldemort Ransomware Virus – Conclusion
Don’t underestimate Voldemort just because of its name. The virus can prove very
dangerous if the crooks behind it start a distribution campaign. Voldemort isn’t the only virus
with a weird name. Here are a few examples of the cyber-criminal imagination:
Hitler Ransomware – A fake ransomware virus named after the Führer.
PokemonGo ransomware – a Pikachu-faced ransomware virus masking as the hit app
Bart2 – a virus named after the brat from The Simpsons
Just in case the virus proves dangerous, we’ll leave malware removal instructions at the end
of this article. With their help, you’ll be able to combat the Voldemort/Nagini ransomware
virus. There’s no magic spell that can remove Voldemort ransomware. If you want to remove
it, you’re going to have to go the muggle route and download an anti-malware tool or remove
it by hand.

IMPORTANT: If you want to be more effective, we strongly suggest booting in safe mode if
you are to do this!
Option Two: By using Windows’s Shadow Volume Copies
To access shadow volume copies you may require a program, like Shadow Explorer. Install
it, open it and make it scan for shadow copies. If you have them enabled, this method will
work, in case the crypto-virus has not deleted them.
Option Three: By using various Recovery Software
This option will not ensure maximum effectiveness and recovery rate but still, you may
restore several files. Most data recovery programs are available for free online, simply
Google “Data Recovery Software”.
Prevent viruses from damaging your files in the future.
To protect your important data, we suggest that you store it in the cloud. Programs that
makes online backup possible also enable you to schedule auto backup on different time
periods and this way, even if you lose your data, you can find it uploaded in securely
encrypted account, access to which only you have.
