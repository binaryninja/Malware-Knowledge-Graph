Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”
Cyber espionage has been a hot topic through the last years. Computer attacks known as “APT”
(Advanced Persistent Threat) have become widely reported and emphasized by the media,
damages are now considered as real and strategic trends are moving in cyber defense.
AIRBUS Defence & Space – CyberSecurity unit responds to such attacks for its customers every
day, developing a complete range of solutions.
Today, we decided to release publicly information on a specific group of APT attackers known as
“Pitty Tiger”. This information comes directly from investigations led by our Threat Intelligence.
Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers that have been active since at least 2011. They have targeted
private companies in several sectors, such as defense and telecommunications, but also at least
one government.
We have been able to track down this group of attackers and can provide detailed information
about them. We were able to collect and reveal their “malware arsenal”. We also analyzed their
technical organization.
Our investigations indicate that Pitty Tiger has not used any 0day vulnerability so far, rather they
prefer using custom malware, developed for the group’s exclusive usage. Our discoveries
indicate that Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers with the ability to stay under the radar, yet still not
as mature as other groups of attackers we monitor.
Pitty Tiger is probably not a state-sponsored group of attackers. They lack the experience and
financial support that one would expect from state-sponsored attackers. We suppose this group
is opportunistic and sells its services to probable competitors of their targets in the private sector.
We have been able to leverage several attackers profiles, showing that the Pitty Tiger group is
fairly small compared to other APT groups, which is probably why we saw them work on a very
limited amount of targets.
At the end of this report, we provide indicators of compromise to help people detect current Pitty
Tiger attacks.

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

MODUS OPERANDI: APT ATTACKS
APT attacks follow what we call the “APT kill chain”. The kill chain describes briefly the way
attackers do perform their actions.
It can be summarized by the following scheme:

RECONNAISSANCE PHASE
The reconnaissance phase commences when an attacker selects a new target and involves the
acquisition of information about that target.
There is very little information available about this phase, and there is little data about it. The only
way to collect information about this phase would be to already monitor all attackers’ actions at this
step, which is hardly feasible.
The longer the attackers spend time in attempting to understand their target and its online presence,
the easier it will be to find efficient ways to penetrate that company’s systems.
This reconnaissance phase is both about finding information to break into the targeted network
successfully and about searching for data which could help to accelerate sensitive information
isolation (like the name of a key employee for example).

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

This phase mostly relies on open sources from the Internet: social networks, press releases, white
papers, corporate websites, search engines, but also on some active tools like vulnerability
scanners etc.

INITIAL COMPROMISE
At this stage, the APT attackers have a solid knowledge of their target and its key employees. The
attackers have everything they need to start looking for an entry point to the company’s network and
establish one or several permanent backdoors into the environment.
The attackers mostly rely on two techniques here to infect one or several computers, usually
workstations, inside the target’s network: spear phishing and drive-by downloads.
Spear phishing can be described as targeted e-mail phishing. In a spear phishing scheme, attackers
send very few e-mails to targeted people. In fact, they can even send just a single e-mail. The trick
is to target the right victim and provide it with the right content, so that they will click on a link leading
to drive-by download of a malware, or open an attached file which will infect their computer.
Some groups of attackers also use “watering hole” techniques to successfully compromise their
targets. To build a watering hole attack, attackers do compromise the website of a third party,
generally a supplier of the target, which is typically visited by a specific group of professionals and
very likely by the target. Every visitor of the compromised third party is then infected. The method
has one major drawback: it will also infect third parties who visit the website. Attackers have
developed ways to avoid this. If their reconnaissance phase has been done effectively, they already
know all IP ranges used by the target company. It just takes a few lines of code in the infecting script
to only compromise visitors coming from the target IP ranges.
Direct attacks against servers of the target can also be a way to penetrate the target’s network.

ACCESS STRENGTHENING & LATERAL MOVES
Attackers have gained access to one or several machines inside the target’s corporate network.
They need to install several different backdoors in order to be able to always access the network. In
case one backdoor falls, there will be others.
As soon as the attackers are sure they have enough access, they start looking for two things:
intellectual property (or anything else they want to know or steal) in alignment with predefined
mission objectives, and a means of privilege escalation to facilitate lateral movement within the
compromised environment. It generally does not take long before the attackers gain domain
administrator privileges and dump all the Active Directory content.
They use lateral moves between machines inside the network, and look for everything they need.
This step is very hard to detect, since they only use valid credentials and legitimate administration
tools such as PsExec.

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

DATA EXFILTRATION
Data exfiltration is the last step before the attackers loop to the lateral moves step, in a never-ending
circle of prolonged access and information theft.
They generally create archive files containing the content they want to exfiltrate, which are then sent
to the attackers by using a remote administration tool (RAT) or transfer protocols such as FTP and
HTTP.
This phase is not the end of an APT attack. The attackers loop to the access strengthening/lateral
moves stage and generally keep stealing more information and stay inside the network for more
data gathering.

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

“PITTY TIGER” INVESTIGATION CONTEXT
During our regular investigations on APT cases, one particular variant of malware caught our
attention, because we had not faced it before. We decided to spend some time to investigate around
this malware and found out that it was used exclusively by a single group of attackers. This malware
family is known as “PittyTiger” by the anti-virus research community.
We discovered this malware sample in June 2014, leading to a command & control (c&c) server still
in activity.
Our researches around this particular malware family revealed the “Pitty Tiger” group has been
active since 2011, yet we found other publications1 which could probably be attributed to the same
group of attacker back in 20102.
This group uses other malware and tools during their APT operations, in addition to the PittyTiger
RAT.
A variant of the infamous Gh0st RAT dubbed “Paladin” has been used repeatedly by the PT group,
together with other RATs which seem to be developed exclusively for the PT group: “MM RAT” (aka
Troj/Goldsun-B), and “CT RAT”. Another variant of Gh0st RAT named “Leo” has been found inactive
on a c&c server.
We also found another malware, named “Troj/ReRol.A”. This one is also used by the group to infect
workstations, collect system information, and install more malware on the infected computer. It acts
as a first stage downloader and system data collector often used in the initial compromise of the
Pitty Tiger campaigns, generally embedded in Microsoft Office documents.
Thanks to server’s misconfigurations, we managed to get information from three c&c servers used
by this group of attackers, which provided us with insight from the end of 2013 to the beginning of
July 2014.
Our investigation has been focused on the data we could get from these c&c servers but also on the
Pitty Tiger environment.
This whitepaper aims to expose the view we have on the group, especially on their infrastructure
and capabilities. We hope this publication will bring further counter analysis from the research
community to enrich the global common threat knowledge.

INFECTION METHODS
SPEAR PHISHING AND WEAPONIZED DOCUMENTS
Pitty Tiger, like most other APT groups, use spear phishing e-mails extensively in order to gain an
initial foothold within the targeted environment.
We have been able to find a spear phishing e-mail crafted by the attackers. This e-mail spoofed the
identity of an employee of a targeted company:
From: XXXXXXX
To: XXXXXXX
File: 1 Attachment: Bird’s Eye Point of View.doc
While the holiday season means clustering clustering ‘time for a
vacation’ for many, there are Those That Will Be of us staying home this
year. That’s why we’ve Decided to take you on a trip around the world
from a bird’s eye view of the item! It’s safe to say That MOST of the
lucky people on vacation Will not see breathtaking sights like these.

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

While this example looks very “amateur” for a spear phishing attempt, we suppose the group has
conducted more advanced spear phishing campaigns, based on the fact that we found infected
Word documents showing content stolen from victims of the group. These documents were infecting
the system with Troj/ReRol.A malware, which we will detail later in this report.
This could mean that the Pitty Tiger group is using stolen material as spear phishing content either
to target other persons in the compromised company, or to target other persons in a competitor’s
company, or more generally to compromise another target.
Pitty Tiger also seem to use fake Microsoft Office Excel content, yet we could only find empty
content delivering once again the Troj/ReRol.A malware.

DIRECT ATTACKS
Although we have not been able to find evidences of any attack aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities on
the group’s targets servers, we have been able to record several vulnerability scanning launched
from one c&c server straight to the targets.
The attackers have been using different vulnerability scanners aimed at their targets. While some
targets have been scanned with “generic” vulnerability scanning tools like HScan or Fluxay and port
scanners like Nmap, some other targets have been scanned for very specific vulnerabilities, like a
ZyWALL vulnerability or a FORTINET product.
We have also been able to testify that the Pitty Tiger group has successfully collected information on
some of their targets by exploiting the HeartBleed1 bug. This vulnerability which exists on some old
versions of OpenSSL allows attackers to collect data from chunks of memory from the targeted
machine. It allowed the Pitty Tiger group to get admin credentials from at least one target, for
example.

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

Running automated vulnerability scanners on whole ranges of IP addresses used by the targets or
on several domains is a very noisy way to collect information and find server vulnerabilities. We
would advocate that this method is unwise when you want to stay furtive, and doing it from a c&c
server is very surprising, to say the least. While the Pitty Tiger group is experienced on some
aspects on its running APT campaigns, it definitely lacks some maturity here.

MALWARE INFORMATION
TROJ/REROL.A
One of the favorite methods used by the Pitty Tiger group to infect users is to use a Microsoft Office
Word document which exploits a specific vulnerability.
The payload infecting the system is malware known as “Troj/ReRol.A”. It is generally the first step of
the initial compromise for Pitty Tiger campaigns.
Exploitation
We have been able to find one such document1 used by that group of attacker, exploiting CVE2012-0158, an old critical vulnerability impacting Microsoft Office and corrected by Microsoft’s
MS12-027 fix in April 2012. This vulnerability affects Microsoft Office versions up to Office 2010. We
also found one RTF document embedding CVE-2014-1761, which is a more recent exploit.
We discovered several different documents spreading this malware by triggering CVE-2012-0158
vulnerability, yet we could not share them in this report, since these documents contain information
about victims of the Pitty Tiger group.
The discovery of this “old” vulnerability exploitation in June 2014 could mean that the Pitty Tiger
group has no direct access to 0day exploits, or not enough budgets to buy some. It could also mean
they use their low range exploit by default because it is working on their targets and is sufficient to
compromise their workstations.
The Word document we initially found was probably a “test” document used by the group. When
opened, it shows a single line written in Chinese language, which can be translated as “Hello!”

Installation
When successfully triggered, the exploit infects the host by dropping and executing a file named
“svohost.exe”2 in the temporary folder of the currently logged-in user:

Beginning of an encrypted communication between the Troj/ReRol.A malware and its c&c server

Very few variants of Troj/ReRol.A are public. The variants we have seen did use that same UserAgent:
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;)
The persistence mechanism used by the malware is the creation of a registry key named “Shell”
containing the path to the malware on the infected system:
Key Path: \REGISTRY\USER\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
Value Name : Shell
Value : explorer.exe,C:\DOCUME~1\XXXXXX\APPLIC~1\svohost.exe,

The payload of this malware is used to collect information on the newly infected host, and send it
back to the c&c server. It can also download and execute binaries.
Command & Control
The data sent in the POST request has a 0x11 bytes header consisting of a fixed-value byte (0xc3)
followed by a 0x10 bytes encryption key. The data following the header is encrypted using RC4 with
the previous key. Once the data is deciphered, the last byte of the clear text should also be 0xc3.
We have been able to decrypt the communications and confirmed what is transmitted to the c&c
server.

Sample information collected by Troj/ReRol.A malware

This information is very useful for an attacker: it shows all software installed on the system, and
running services.
Once this data has been transferred to the c&c server, it responds by sending additional malware to
execute on the machine.
The c&c part consists of two files:
- dr.asp: an ASP frontend instantiating a control, setting some variables, and passing the
payload.
- JHttpSrv.dll: a controller which should be registered via “regsvr32”. It exposes 4 methods
which can be called by the ASP script:
o SetIP(strIP): sets the bot IP address
o AddKeyword(strKeyword, strFilePath): binds a keyword to a binary on the server
o Work(lpByteArray, nDataLength): deciphers the payload, looks for the registered
keywords, and writes it to a logfile
o ResponseBinary(): sends back the binary matching a specific a keyword

The dr.asp registers the following keywords:
- “SysType :32bit” to the binary “32.exe”
- “SysType :64bit” to the binary “64.exe”
These two binaries were no longer available on the server. However, we found various files which
could have been used as “32.exe” in the past:
- 3200.exe
- 322.exe
- 32m.exe
- 32mm.exe
The 322.exe file is a legitimate, Chinese, calc.exe tool. It might have been used by the attackers to
perform tests.
The 3 others binaries are RATs, which will be detailed in the next parts.

PITTYTIGER RAT
This RAT is the origin of the attackers’ group name. “PittyTiger” is a mutex used by the malware.
“Pitty Tiger” is also a string transmitted in the network communications of the RAT, as you will see in
this chapter.
Installation
The malware1, when running in our sandbox, triggers the following alarms:

The “qmgrxp.exe” binary is a simple copy of the original binary. It drops the “packet64.dll”, and
injects it in “explorer.exe”. When executed, a mutex called “PittyTiger” is created.

Value Name: UserInit
Value: C:\WINDOWS\system32\userinit.exe,C:\WINDOWS\system32\qmgrxp.exe,

The “packet64.dll” is the main payload of the RAT. After being injected, it starts sending its Hello
packet to its c&c server:

Our sample had 3 c&c servers configured:
- jackyandy.avstore.com.tw:80
- chanxe.avstore.com.tw:443

The following commands are implemented:
- File Download (get) and Upload (put)
- Screen Capture 8bit (prtsc) and 16bit (prtsc2)
- Remote Shell (ocmd/ccmd)
- Configuration update (setserv/freshserv)
- Direct command execution
Regarding the controller part, we found two different versions:
- A Delphi binary handling PittyTiger connections only
- A .NET binary handling both PittyTiger and CT connections
The interface handling both Pitty TIGER and CT connections is very interesting. We have been able
to confirm that the author of those two families of malware is the same person, as will be seen in the
next chapter about “CT RAT”.

CT RAT
This remote administration tool is often used by the Pitty Tiger group. We have been able to acquire
both the client and the server parts.
We found two instances of the same binary with different names – 32mm.exe and mm32.exe1.
This RAT seems to be an evolution of PittyTiger, since a specific server binary we found could
handle both requests from CT and PittyTiger, and was indicated as compatible with PittyTiger.
Moreover, the same commands are implemented in both RATs.
Installation
Unsurprisingly, when running in our sandbox, the RAT triggers the same alarms as PittyTiger:

It contains the computer name, the user name, the internal IP address, the OS version, the RAT
internal version and the Language ID of the system.
The RAT can then receive commands from its c&c. Usual RAT features are implemented:
- File Download (GET) and Upload (PUT)
- Remote shell (ocmd/ccmd)
- Configuration update (cfg)
- Sleep (sleep)
Version and author(s)
Regarding the configuration, our sample communicates with “sop.avstore.com.tw”, and contains the
string “Nov 13 2013”, which should be a version identifier.
The c&c part is a Windows binary written in .NET. We found 2 versions:
- Version 2013.10: CT only controller
- Version 2013.12: CT and PittyTiger controller

MM RAT (AKA TROJ/GOLDSUN-B)
We named this malware “MM RAT” at the beginning of our investigation, before we found an
existing name for it, “Troj/Goldsun-B” according to Sophos. This is another remote administration
tool often used by the Pitty Tiger crew. We have been able to acquire both a client and server part
for it.
Installation
The binary we found is named 3200.exe1, and triggers the following alarms in our sandbox:

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

File dropped by the malware in our sandbox

The binary is also copied to the user’s “Application Data” directory, and injects the “release.tmp” file
in “explorer.exe”.
Persistence is achieved by adding the path to the binary to the Winlogon Shell key:
Key Path: \REGISTRY\USER\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
Value Name: Shell
Value: explorer.exe,C:\DOCUME~1\<UserName>\APPLIC~1\<binary name>,

The RAT embeds its own DNS server IP addresses to make the c&c domain names resolutions.
These addresses are listed below:
-

63.251.83.36
64.74.96.242
69.251.142.1
212.118.243.118
216.52.184.230
61.145.112.78
218.16.121.32

Command & Control
It starts resolving its domains after injection, and immediately sends requests. First requests are
used to check for updates (GET request on /httpdocs/update/update.ini). A Hello packet is then sent:

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

Hello packet sent by Troj/Goldsun-B to its c&c server

The bot then repeatedly sends GET requests on “/httpdocs/mm/<bot_id>/ComMand.sec” to retrieve
remote commands.
The communication protocol is quite simple: GET requests are used to receive data from the c&c,
and POST requests to send data. In POST commands, the CGI name represents the command.
The following features are implemented:
- c&c authentication using password
- Remote shell
- Remote commands
- File Download / Upload / Deletion / Search
- Bot termination
The following CGI files can be requested by the bot:
- Vip: test for connectivity
- Owpp4: register new bot
- CReply: answer to remote commands
- Clrf: clear remote file (to clear ComMand.sec after reading)
- CFile: transmit file (file transfers or answers to commands)
- Cerr: send error
The configuration is stored locally in a file called “schmup.sys”. The file is ciphered using RC4, using
the MD5 hash of “rEdstArs” as the key.
Our sample uses “mca.avstore.com.tw”, “star.yamn.net” and “bz.kimoo.com.tw” as c&c servers. It
contains the “1.6.0” version number, and uses the password “9ol.8ik,” to authenticate with the bots.
Unlike others c&c binaries, the c&c part of this RAT does not have a graphical interface, but can be
remotely requested to manage the bots. Furthermore, no authentication is required to send
commands to the c&c (but you need to know the configured password to interact with the bots).
The management protocol is the same as the bots protocol, with different CGI files:
- Shutdown: shutdown the c&c
- Cnor: add a new command for a bot (writes it in “ComMand.sec”)
- Mlist: get the list of bots
- Mlist2: write the list of bots to the file “Online.dat”

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

The bots’ answers to remote commands can be retrieved by requesting the “Reply.sec” file (e.g.
GET /httpdocs/mm/<bot_id>/Reply.sec)
Network patterns
These network patterns might ring bells in some researcher’s minds. The network communication
used by this binary are the same as those used by the Enfal malware, which has been used in the
past by the Lurid group (APT attackers) and by other threat actors in China1.
An examination of the code did not reveal code similarities with the Enfal malware. We do not
currently know why this malware uses the same patterns to communicate.

PALADIN RAT
This is another remote administration tool used by the Pitty Tiger group. We have been able to get
both a client and server part of it.
Installation
The binary we found was dropped by a malicious Word document. The following alarms are
triggered in the sandbox:

The shellcode contained in the Word file drops the following file, and executes it:
- C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Local Settings\Temp\svohost.exe2
This one drops in turn the following file:

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

File dropped by the malware in our sandbox

This tmp file is then copied to “C:\Windows\system32\Nwsapagentex.dll” and registered as a service
called “Nwsapagent”.
This malware is a variant of the infamous Gh0st RAT1. Our specific sample uses “ssss0” instead of
the usual “Gh0st” header for network communications.
Command & Control
The commands ID used in the communication protocol have also changed, but the features are
quite the same.
The configuration is directly embedded in the binary, and deciphered at runtime. Up to 5 c&c servers
can be configured, but our sample only had one: “ey.avstore.com.tw:53”.
“EY” could stand for “Ernst & Young”. It would not be very surprising, since a lot of different attack
groups do use anti-virus vendors or other big company’s names to try to look more legitimate. Pitty
Tiger is no exception, as detailed later in this report.
We also found two c&c binaries, claiming to be versions 2.1 and 2.2 of the Paladin RAT controller.
Version 2.1 answers to the “ssss0” header, while version 2.2 uses the classical “Gh0st” header.

Paladin has multiple features: file transfer, screenshot, command shell …

LEO RAT
Additionally to the Paladin RAT, we found another variant of Gh0st RAT, named “Leo”. Although we
have found it on a c&c server of the group, there is no evidence that is has been used by the group,
in opposition to Paladin which is used often by Pitty Tiger.
Moreover, the built malware we found in the same folder was configured to connect to a local IP
address, probably for testing purposes.

INFRASTRUCTURE
Our investigation has focused on three particular c&c servers used by the group. These c&c servers,
unlike the other c&cs used by the group, have been misconfigured. Once parsed and dumped, it
provided us with more insight.
We found several domains used by the Pitty Tiger group, the most interesting ones being detailed in
this chapter.
Pitty Tiger, like other APT attackers, often use anti-virus “familiar names” when registering domains
or creating subdomains. Some examples can be avstore.com.tw, sophos.skypetm.com.tw,
symantecs.com.tw, trendmicro.org.tw etc.

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

VICTIMS
Mapping the victims of such a targeted campaign is not an easy task.
We have found the Pitty Tiger group to be very active against one particular private company from
the defense industry and one academic network of a government, , yet we think it was done to be
used as a proxy for some of the group’s operations.
We have also found some connections from other companies to the c&c servers, yet we did not find
evidence that they were real victims.
These alleged victims do work in different sectors and are located mostly in European countries.

1 company from the telecommunications industry;
1 company specialized in web development.

It might be surprising to see a company specialized in web development here, yet it has built
websites for interesting potential targets. We suspect Pitty Tiger to use this compromise to spear
phish other companies which are in commercial relation with this web development company.
We have to mention that we only had access to three of the several attackers’ servers. Therefore,
we suppose the Pitty Tiger group could have more targets than what we could confirm.
We also found a lot of vulnerability scanners launched by the attackers at different targets, yet there
was no sign of compromise.
During the course of our investigations, we discovered a RAR archive on the attacker’s server
containing 5 Word documents and one small C source code. These documents belong to the
defense company which has been compromised. According to the name of the files and the general
feel of the archive, we do think it was extracted by the attackers to “show” someone what kind of
data they could get from the compromise of that particular target. The documents were still
exhibiting comments from various users, showing it was an ongoing work and not old documents.
Interestingly enough, we saw a part of these documents appear on Virus-Total, with an additional
“gift” from the attackers, a payload dropping a malware.
There are only two options we can think of here:
 Someone from the same company has been targeted with this document.
 Someone from another company has been targeted with this document. This other company
could be a partner or competitor.
Since we were unable to determine the intended use of this specific document, we can only suppose
that it could be used to provide commercial advantages to competitors of that company, or used by
a foreign state.

The attacker goes on like this, using his tools, and then ends the communication with this RAT on
that computer.
Please note that at this point, the attacker has at least the privileges of a local administrator, since
he is allowed to write content in the system32 folder of a Windows XP system. He could also gain
the credentials to a sensitive e-mail account.
In addition to all information already shown, we saw Toot connect to an account on a cloud service
named “Baidu Drive”. The e-mail address linked to this account is dyanmips@qq.com (QQ-ID:
2589315828). We could find traces of two other e-mail accounts associated to Toot,
cisco_dyanmips@qq.com (QQ ID: 204156335) and cisco_dynamips@qq.com (QQ ID:
1878836793).
We did not find more information about user “Toot”, yet we miss Chinese language capabilities.

“COLD & SNOW”
The controller part of CT RAT/PittyTiger RAT revealed the following “about” information, once
translated from Chinese to English language:
CT console (compatible pittytiger) v1.3
2013.12 by Trees and snow

We believe this translation of the author’s name might not be accurate due to the use of automated
translation tools. Moreover, we have strong suspicions that there is not a single individual
nicknamed “Trees and snow” but rather two programmers nicknamed “Trees” and “Snow”. “Trees”
could also be “Cold”. We noticed that the symbol for this word is translated differently according to
the context it is used in. Once again, we lack Chinese language skills.
We identify the two nicknames on the current campaign as Automn Snow (秋雪) and Cold Air Kiss (
风吻寒).
While we are confident that these people are indeed the developers of both PittyTiger and CT RAT
malware, we are not sure they belong to the PittyTiger group. These developers might just have
been hired to develop these RATs. They might also just be selling it to the PittyTiger group. There is
no trace of usage from other attacking groups, we believe the PittyTiger RAT is exclusively used by
this group of attackers.

ROLES AND ORGANIZATION
According to indicators we gathered and threat activities profiling we have some hypothesis on the
way the group is conducting its operations.
We have strong evidence of a bot operator position. We identify one nickname for this position, the
user known as TooT. As we did not see other nickname, we think that TooT is one person and not a
group of persons.
We also identified a malware development position. We identified two nicknames for this position on
the current campaign, Automn Snow (秋雪) and Cold Air Kiss ( 风吻寒). Yet we are unsure that they
belong to the group, they might just be a third party providing or selling their malware.
We have a strong suspicion of a coordinator position, which coordinates the bot operator, provides
him with some logistics support (weaponized document, tools…) and reviews the programmers
work. This position could imply a communication channel with another manager.
We named this position ‘Chen’, in relation with several references of this common Chinese name in
c&c WHOIS and other investigation materials.
We have some suspicion of a customer relationship manager position that may act as an interface
between a customer and Chen. We named this position ‘Lilly’.

Malware (Troj/ReRol.A)
Remote Administration Tools (MM RAT, CT RAT, Pitty Tiger, Paladin)
E-mail espionage tools (cp.exe, mailpv.exe)
Passwords dumpers (gsecdump, NirSoft tools, Mimikatz etc.)
Network scanners (pr.exe)
Network-oriented tools (po.exe)
Vulnerability scanners (ssql.exe, Fluxay, etc.)

What is rare to find is the controller part of those tools. We have been lucky enough to get the
controller part of Pitty Tiger and CT RAT, and even to get a kind of hybrid controller made for CT
RAT but also supporting Pitty Tiger. We suppose that the CT RAT is the new evolution of Pitty Tiger
and that it will replace Pitty Tiger in the following months.
The presence of a Chinese version of “calc.exe”, the official calculator provided in Microsoft
Windows, is interesting. Not only is it one more indicator of a probable Chinese origin, but also an
indicator that this server was probably used as a test base, in addition to being operational and
controlling infected machines from different targets.
In addition to those tools, we found some interesting scripts. A script named ipc.bat uses a file
named user.txt to try to brute-force a shared folder access:
for /f "tokens=1,2 delims= " %%i in (user.txt) do (net use \\<TARGETEDIP>\ipc$ "%%j" /u:%%i)
&& (net use \\<TARGETEDIP> /del) && (echo user:%%i pass:%%j>>succ.txt)
One script used to brute-force a network share inside a company’s network

The user.txt file contains thousands of lines, each one being a couple of one particular username
and one password attempt:

This user.txt file has been anonymized, yet we wanted to give you the feel for it. This file is 67320
lines long, and uses 5610 different passwords for each of 12 users contained in this file. The user
names are clearly the result from a user enumeration and are dedicated to a particular French
victim.
The passwords listed in this file are either build from several campaigns or from the current
campaign. A lot of passwords are related to the targeted company and might be previous passwords
from users.
We have also discovered a pack of files which can be used to trigger an Internet Explorer
vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322). The date of these files, namely Tope.swf and index.html, was
2014/02/18, a few days after the revelation of existing exploits in the wild used in APT attacks1.
We do not know if the Pitty Tiger group used this exploit or not, but found no trace indicating they
did. A lot of different attackers seem to have used that vulnerability since.

Several Chinese vulnerability scanners have been launched against targets;
Several Chinese tools have been used and found on the c&c servers of the attackers:
8uFTP, a Chinese version of calc.exe, etc.;
Two of the used RATs have been developed by the same developers: CT RAT and
PittyTiger RAT. The controllers for these RATs show Chinese language;
Several binaries used by the attackers show either “Chinese - China” or “Chinese-Taiwan”
language ID in their resources;

Operation Pitty Tiger – “The Eye of the Tiger”

CONCLUSION
Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers that have been active since at least 2011.
Pitty Tiger is effective and mature in the use of targeted malware, the use of known exploits to infect
computers with their malware and the creation of an infrastructure to efficiently conduct APT attacks.
They are quite unprofessional in their way of using their infrastructure: they do launch vulnerability
scanners directly from a c&c server and also use their connection for personal activities
(downloading pornographic material for example, as we have seen a whole folder on a c&c server
full of xxx torrent links).
Pitty Tiger is probably not a state-sponsored group of attackers. The attackers lack the experience
and financial support that one would expect from state-sponsored attackers. We suppose this group
is opportunistic and sells its services to probable competitors of their targets in the private sector.
One governmental network has been targeted by the group, yet we do not have any evidence of the
purpose of this attack. We suppose this particular attack has been executed to provide a usable
bounce for the group.
The campaign we studied has been largely focused on one particular target. We suspect the Pitty
Tiger group to work according to an opportunistic business model: this group might offer its services
to third parties from the private sector.
This group seems to be very small compared to other APT groups. We have leveraged several
profiles and could identify some attackers to a certain extent. We believe this group might keep
working as it is now, with limited budgets, or grow to extend its attacking campaign capabilities.
