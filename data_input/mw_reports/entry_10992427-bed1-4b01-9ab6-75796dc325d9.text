APT32 Continues ASEAN Targeting

During the last weeks of January (2018), nation state actors from APT32 (Lotus Blossom) conducted a
targeted malspam campaign against the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. This
isn't terribly surprising considering the group's watering hole activity against ASEAN websites

as

observed in the Fall of 2017. In another apparent prong of attack, the new campaign delivers a malicious
RTF document

posing as an ASEAN Defence Minister's Meeting (ADMM) directory (decoy) that also

carries an executable (payload) embedded as an OLE object, the Elise backdoor.

The Elise backdoor is not new malware and has been successfully diagnosed in the past by Industry
researchers (e.g. Palo Alto Unit 42's 2015 report ) and more recently by Volexity

and Accenture .

Each of these are valuable resources to understanding the Elise malcode, infection process, and known
capabilities of the backdoor. In addition, a current ANY.RUN playback of our observed Elise infection

is

also available.
Upon opening of the MS Word document, our embedded file exploits CVE­2017­11882

to drop a

malicious fake Norton Security Shell Extension module, 'NavShExt.dll ', which is then injected into
iexplore.exe to install the backdoor, begin collection, and activate command and control.

Moving through the infection process, NetWitness Endpoint detects the initial exploit (CVE­2017­1182 ) in
action as the Microsoft Equation Editor, 'EQNEDT32.exe', scores high for potentially malicious activity. This
same process was also flagged in our any.run playback.

Our malware then spins up an instance of 'iexplore.exe' and injects 'NavShExt.dll ' into that process.

While this is happening, the malware establishes persistence by creating an autorun in the registry and then
also creates 'thumbcache_1CD60.db' at 'Users\admin\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\' to
store harvested data.

As the infection process completes, we now observe Elise network activity (e.g., exfil of victim data and C2)
through a conveniently hidden instance of Internet Explorer.

This traffic was also observed in NetWitness Packets, as the malware verifies the host IP address prior
to kicking off C2 out to 103.236.150[.]14 , which is likely compromised infrastructure.

Take note of the cookie set in this HTTP POST, because Lotus Blossom actors go to significant lengths to
protect this data via both B64 encoding and AES encryption. The actual C2 for Elise takes place over
"cookie" code and (rarely) body content.

Other infections (from the identical payload) each generated their own decoy domains to populate the host
header, but in every case actually used the same hard­coded IP address, 103.236.150[.]14 .

The threat actors actually went to significant efforts to generate these seemingly random domains, likely in
an attempt at obfuscating C2 traffic and avoiding domain­based detection/mitigation.

Based on both previous activity and this current Lotus Blossom campaign, it is clear that we are witnessing
the continued rise of cyber tradecraft and activity from nation­states in the Southeast Asian theater.
