On the trail of the XMRig miner

As protection methods improve, the developers of miners have had to enhance their own
creations, often turning to non-trivial solutions. Several such solutions (previously unseen by
us) were detected during our analysis of the open source miner XMRig.

How it all began: ransominer
Alongside well-known groups that make money from data theft and ransomware (for
example, Maze, which is suspected of the recent attacks on SK Hynix and LG Electronics),
many would-be attackers are attracted by the high-profile successes of cybercrime. In terms
of technical capabilities, such amateurs lag far behind organized groups and therefore use
publicly available ransomware, targeting ordinary users instead of the corporate sector.

The outlays on such attacks are often quite small, so the miscreants have to resort to various
stratagems to maximize the payout from each infected machine. For example, in August of
this year, we noticed a rather curious infection method: on the victim’s machine, a Trojan (a
common one detected by our solutions as Trojan.Win32.Generic) was run, which installed
administration programs, added a new user, and opened RDP access to the computer. Next,
the ransomware Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Crusis started on the same machine, followed by the
loader of the XMRig miner, which then set about mining Monero cryptocurrency.
As a result, the computer would already start earning money for the cybercriminals just as
the user saw the ransom note. In addition, RDP access allowed the attackers to manually
study the victim’s network and, if desired, spread the ransomware to other nodes.

We decided to use KSN to examine how often XMRig and its modifications get bundled with
malware. It emerged that in August 2020 there were more than 5,000 attempts to install it on
users’ computers. The parties responsible for its distribution turned out to be the Prometei
malware family and a new family called Cliptomaner.

Prometei backdoor
The Prometei family has been known since 2016, but spotted together with XMRig for the
first time in February 2020. What’s more, the backdoor was distributed in an unusual way:
whereas during ordinary attacks the cybercriminals gain server access through various
exploits, this time they used brute-force attacks. Having thus obtained usernames and
passwords for computers with MS SQL installed, the attackers used the T-SQL function
xp_cmdshell to run several PowerShell scripts and elevated the privileges of the current user
by exploiting the CVE-2016-0099 vulnerability. After that, Purple Fox Trojan and Prometei
itself were installed on the victim’s machine. The whole attack, starting with the brute-forcing
of credentials to connect to the SQL server and ending with the installation of Prometei, was
carried out in fully automatic mode.
The installation process is of interest: the .NET executable file, packed into an ELF file using
standard .NET Core tools (Apphost), sends information about the infected machine to the
C&C server, and then downloads the cryptocurrency miner and its configuration. The
versions of the loaders for Windows and Linux differ only slightly: the .NET build for different
platforms saved the attackers from having to create a separate loader for Linux and allowed
cryptocurrency mining on powerful Windows and Linux servers.

Cliptomaner miner
Detected in September 2020, Cliptomaner is very similar to its fellows: like them, it not only
mines cryptocurrency, but can also substitute cryptowallet addresses in the clipboard. The
miner version is selected according to the computer configuration and downloaded from
C&C. The malware is distributed under the guise of software for Realtek audio equipment.
On the whole, we saw no new techniques, but interestingly Cliptomaner is written entirely in
the AutoIT scripting language. Most of the time, families with similar behavior are written in
compiled languages, such as C# or C, but in this case the authors opted for a more creative
approach, and wrote a lengthy script that selects the required version of the miner and
receives cryptowallet addresses from C&C for substitution.

Kaspersky security solutions detect the above malicious programs with the following verdicts:
HEUR:Trojan.MSIL.Prometei.gen, HEUR:Trojan.Script.Cliptomaner.gen, HEUR:TrojanDownloader.Win32.Generic, Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Crusis, Trojan.Win64.Agentb, not-avirus:RiskTool.Win64.XMRigMiner
