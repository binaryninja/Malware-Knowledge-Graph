Earlier today, government agencies in the US, UK, and Canada warned that APT29, or The
Dukes as they’re known in some circles, has been targeting organizations’ working on
COVID-19 vaccines.
Speaking with reporters earlier today, F-Secure Director of Strategy and Corporate
Development Artturi Lehtiö, who was the lead researcher in a 2015 analysis of the group’s
activities, said these kinds of organizations are not traditional targets for The Dukes.
However, he also highlights that the attacks are consistent with The Dukes’ alignment with
national security interests – of which the coronavirus pandemic certainly qualifies.
Not the traditional kind of target organization for APT29 aka Dukes. But COVID-19 is
obviously a national security priority and those most definitely are the traditional remit
of APT29. https://t.co/D3Zvl7whZS

According to a report published by the UK’s NCSC, The Dukes are using public exploits
against unpatched software to gain footholds in systems with the intent to steal information
related to COVID-19 vaccines. After this initial access, they use malware to steal information.
The report says The Dukes are also using spear phishing attacks – similar to the one in the
video below – to manipulate users into disclosing login credentials.

Artturi points out that while The Dukes have compromised research organizations, such as
universities, in the past, they’ve done so primarily to leverage that access in attacks against
organizations more directly related to governments. In this case, Artturi thinks that The
Dukes’ sudden interest in stealing intellectual property could signal a shift in their priorities
due to the severity of the pandemic in Russia.
“APT29 has traditionally focused on intelligence to inform national and security policy, rather
than the theft of intellectual property. However, COVID-19 could be such a major national
security priority for Russia that they need all hands-on deck. For what it’s worth, APT29’s
history of targeting universities has been, to the best of our knowledge, a stepping stone to
targeting think tanks and eventually governmental targets. But, since they’ve traditionally had
access to these other networks, perhaps that’s also now being utilized for this new priority.”
