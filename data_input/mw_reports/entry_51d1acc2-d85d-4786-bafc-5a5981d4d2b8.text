Some time ago I published a post where I was briefly discussing some of the most well
known APT aliases associated with specific government organizations of the Russian
Federation. Since recently we had lots of additional information being released from official
sources (US and UK governments), I decided to make this into a more thorough diagram.
The sources used are listed below.
I hope that they weren’t wrong, but if you notice any mistakes, missing details or incorrect
information please let me know to update it accordingly.
