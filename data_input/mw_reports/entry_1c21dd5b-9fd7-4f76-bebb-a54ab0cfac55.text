Key Findings
Phones belonging to four Jordanian human rights defenders, lawyers, and journalists
were hacked with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware between August 2019 and
December 2021.
We assess that at least two of the four targets were hacked by Pegasus operators
primarily focused on Jordan, based on SMS messages containing Pegasus links that
map to a cluster of domain names focusing on Jordanian themes.
One of the targets’ iPhones was successfully hacked on December 5, 2021, showing
that NSO Group has remained active on Apple’s platform even after Apple sued NSO
Group and notified Pegasus targets in November 2021.
We identify two Pegasus operators that we believe are likely agencies of the Jordanian
government. The first, which we name MANSAF, has been active since at least
December 2018, and the second, which we name BLACKIRIS, has been active since
at least December 2020.
Our findings build on an earlier report from Front Line Defenders, which found that the
phone of Hala Ahed Deeb, a Jordanian lawyer and woman human rights defender, was
infected with Pegasus.

1. Human Rights in Jordan

2/14

Jordanian human rights defenders (HRDs) work in a generally hostile environment. Since the
Arab Spring in 2011, grassroots protests have emerged, reflecting growing discontent with
government corruption and wealth inequality, among other issues. In response, authorities
have often arrested activists and curtailed freedoms.
Jordan saw a wave of protests in 2011, as part of the Arab Spring. Protests were driven
partly by the Hirak, groups of youth activists not connected with traditional centres of political
power in Jordan. Protests flared up again in June 2018, galvanised by a government plan to
increase taxes and reduce subsidies, as required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
More than 30 trade unions called a general strike, and protesters occupied the Fourth Circle
area of Amman near the Prime Minister’s office. In response, the government temporarily
withdrew the bill, and re-introduced it in September 2018 with minor changes. When the bill’s
final text was published in the Official Gazette in December 2018, activists once again held
protests in the Fourth Circle that persisted into 2019. In March 2019, Jordanian authorities
began a wave of arrests against Hirak members, charging them with “insulting the King” and
“undermining the political regime.”
In September 2019, Jordan’s largest union, the Jordanian Teachers Syndicate (JTS),
announced a strike for higher wages. The strike shut down most schools in Jordan for a
month, and the government was forced to agree to a pay increase. However, in April 2020,
the government cancelled the pay increase, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. When JTS
planned a new wave of protests, the government arrested JTS’ entire board, ordered their
offices closed for two years, and issued a gag order preventing public discussion of the
case. Nevertheless, teachers protested again in July 2020, and Jordanian security forces
responded by arresting around 1000 teachers.
February and March 2022 saw additional crackdowns on activists. Detainees were charged
with “spreading false news” and “inciting strife.”

2. Hacking of Jordanian Targets
In January 2022, Front Line Defenders published a report finding that the phone of Hala
Ahed Deeb, a Jordanian lawyer and woman human rights defender, was infected with
Pegasus. Following publication, Front Line Defenders received numerous requests from
Jordanian human rights defenders, journalists, and other civil society activists to inspect their
devices. Front Line Defenders checked more than 60 iPhones in collaboration with the
Citizen Lab, with case referrals from the Jordan Open Source Association. Three of the
victims consented to be identified (listed below), while one wished to remain anonymous.
The results of our forensic analysis were peer reviewed by Amnesty International’s Security
Lab.

Victim: Ahmed Al-Neimat

3/14

Ahmed Al-Neimat is a human rights defender, an anti-corruption activist, and a member of
the Hirak movement. In 2019, Al-Neimat was arrested for “insulting the king”. In 2020, AlNeimat was arrested after he filed a complaint at the National Center for Human Rights
(Jordan’s national human rights body), and was only released after signing a pledge to never
return to the Center. In 2021, Al-Neimat was again arrested after he posted bail for another
arrested Hirak activist. In February 2022, Al-Neimat was again arrested in a case relating to
protests against the situation at Al-Salt State Hospital, where lack of oxygen killed several
COVID-19 patients. He is currently in prison as of the publication of this report.

Figure 1: Ahmed Al-Neimat.

Hacking of Ahmad Al-Neimat
Al-Neimat’s phone logs show that his phone was hacked on or around January 28, 2021 for
a period of approximately two days. The logs indicate that this was a zero-click exploit, likely
the FORCEDENTRY exploit. We had not previously seen any cases of FORCEDENTRY
deployed before February 2021, making this the earliest suspected FORCEDENTRY case.

Victim: Malik Abu Orabi
Malik Abu Orabi is a human rights lawyer and a member of the National Forum for the
Defense of Liberties. Orabi is one of the lawyers defending the JTS, and is also the lawyer of
Al-Neimat. Orabi was arrested at a protest in March 2021, and fined 100 Jordanian dinars

(approximately 110 USD) for violating COVID-19 restrictions. Front Line Defenders has
documented Orabi’s case.

was hacked at least twice, once on or around 2021-10-03, and once on or around 2021-1005.

3. Spyware in Jordan
The Jordanian Government appears to have used spyware for a number of years, including
FinFisher spyware, which the Citizen Lab detected in December 2014. However, no civil
society targets of FinFisher spyware in Jordan have been publicly identified.

Suspected Jordanian Use of Pegasus
Based on our Internet scanning and monitoring of NSO Pegasus servers at the Citizen Lab,
we believe that there are two Pegasus customers that are primarily focused on spying in
Jordan.
One of the customers, which we name MANSAF, appears to be spying primarily in Jordan,
with limited additional operations in Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. We believe that
MANSAF has been operating since December 2018.
The other customer, which we name BLACKIRIS, appears to be spying almost exclusively in
Jordan, and has been active since at least December 2020. An April 2021 report in Axios
mentioned negotiations between NSO Group and Jordanian authorities “in recent months,”
with one source mentioning a contract had been signed.

Targets in this Case

10/14

Both Jaradat and Orabi received text messages (Figures 3, 5, 6) that included links to
Pegasus websites. The websites matched our Internet scanning for Pegasus servers, and
appear to all have been registered by Dreamhost. This is noteworthy as we have typically
observed different Pegasus customers’ infrastructure set up with different hosting providers.
We provide a list of all Dreamhost websites that we detected in scanning below. We redact
several names given that they contain themes suggestive of targeting terrorist groups:

While we cannot directly connect these names to any specific Pegasus operator (because of
the way the domain names are set up), we do believe that this cluster of domains shows a
focus indicative of Jordan.

4. Conclusion
In this report, we find once again that a government client of NSO Group has used Pegasus
to spy on civil society targets that are neither terrorists nor criminals. This case adds to the
large number of other cases of abuse of Pegasus worldwide, which amount to an
indisputable indictment against NSO Group, and its ownership, for their inability or
unwillingness to put in place even the most basic human rights-respecting safeguards. The
fact that the targeting we uncovered happened after the widespread publicity around Apple’s
lawsuit and notifications to victims is especially remarkable; a firm that truly respected such
concerns would have at least paused operations for government clients, like Jordan, that
have a widely publicised track record of human rights concerns and had enacted emergency
powers giving authorities widespread latitude to infringe on civil liberties.

Gender Dimensions of Online Surveillance
The targeting of women HRDs merits special attention. Our research, and that of a growing
number of others, has documented a disturbing rise in gender-based digital repression
practices. Pegasus mercenary spyware guarantees the state’s clients to have full control
over the infected devices’ camera, microphone, emails, applications, text messages, call
logs, and to obtain unlimited amounts of the targets’ data. In the case of female targets, the
risk is higher. It is seriously concerning that private chats, private photographs, and other
personal data may have been exfiltrated from the female targets’ devices.
Women are also disproportionately vulnerable to online harms, blackmail, and digitallyrelated acts of violence or technology-facilitated gender-based violence, especially in
patriarchal societies and in countries with discriminatory practices and laws against women.
In conservative countries like Jordan, women are also frequently the subject of “family
honour” and “honour crimes,” which are rendered immune by state regulations and practices.
There are multifold and severe impacts on female activists and journalists who experience
device hacking, such as blackmail and harassment, judicial consequences, social impacts,
physical or emotional harm, the undermining of freedom of expression, self censorship, loss
of employment, and a negative impact on self-worth and dignity. Moreover, such attacks are
not isolated to the victims themselves; they can impact the lives of vulnerable people in their
communities who journalists and activists document and on whose behalf they undertake
advocacy. As Lama Fakih, director of Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch,
who was also targeted with Pegasus, pointed out: “My first thought when I found out I was
targeted was ‘How does this impact the people I am advocating for in my network?”

12/14

According to sociologist Sarah Sobieraj, “[e]ntering and using digital publics to share work,
ideas, opinions, and experiences often comes at a great cost for women” who “bear the brunt
of digital hate.”
As Access Now and Front Line Defenders noted in a previous report regarding the targeting
of women HRDs in Bahrain and Jordan with Pegasus spyware, the impacts for women are
particularly severe, causing women to “live in a perpetual state of fear, become socially
isolated and restricted in their social lives, work, and activism.” Our latest report adds yet
another troubling indicator to the NSO Group file and to the deeply harmful impact that the
use of Pegasus spyware has on women activists. The fact that Jaradat and WHRD /
Journalist A are also both women journalists compounds and amplifies these concerns.
There can be no doubt that NSO Group has become one of the world’s leading purveyors of
these harms, and its continued use will invariably contribute to further discrimimation against
women and marginalized groups. Going forward, further research into the impact of digital
repression on women HRDs in the Global South is critical. Amplifying the voices of women in
the Global South targeted by Pegasus spyware, as well as other forms of digital repression,
is important to showing how severe the impacts of digital repression are—particularly in
regions where human rights are routinely disregarded—and bringing accountability to an
industry running wild.
