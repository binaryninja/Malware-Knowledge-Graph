Snatch Ransomware

June 21, 2020

Another RDP brute force ransomware strikes again, this time, Snatch Team! Snatch Team
was able to go from brute forcing a Domain Administrator (DA) account via RDP, to running a
Meterpreter reverse shell and a RDP proxy via Tor on a Domain Controller (DC), to
encrypting all Domain joined systems in under 5 hours.

1/13

Snatch is a widely known variant due to it causing systems to reboot into safe mode before
encrypting the system. SophosLabs has an excellent write up on Snatch which was very
similar to what we witnessed.

Initial Access:
Snatch Team logged into a DA account from 193.70.12.240 around 0515 UTC. Initially with
that access they performed a simple arp -a.
At 0753 UTC the threat actors made the next move running ipconfig and quser. Just minutes
later they began lateral movement initiating an RDP session with a DC.

Lateral Movement and Persistence:
Once on the DC the threat actor moved quickly deploying a tool set in C:\Windows. This tool
set included 2 executable that masqueraded as Windows Management Instrumentation files.
One was executed with the following command parameters.

2/13

The .dat file turned out to be a configuration file with the executable being TOR creating an
RDP tunnel. (Wouldn’t this be really really slow?)

The other executable file in the wmis folder was a Go executable of unknown providence
potentially related to utorrent capability?
The next thing they did was create a reverse shell using what we think is Meterpreter. C2
initiated over HTTPS/443 to 91.229.77.161 via cplXen.exe
The presence of logs indicating the use of named pipe services also increases the likelihood
of Meterpreter or possibly Cobaltstrike. We didn’t see any ET Pro signatures fire for this
activity but we also didn’t have SSL inspection on at the time.

A separate executable was then dropped for stealthy persistence of cplXen.exe. X3.exe is a
loader that uses the 3 DLLs (which are ini files) below to run cplXen.

jd4ob7162ns.dll: C:\windows\system32\cplXen.exe /F
fw0a53482aa.dll: 443
kb05987631s.dll: 91.229.77.161

Two Scheduled Tasks were created to launch the loader, which in turn persists the loading of
cplXen.exe.

3/13

x3.exe had a very low VT hit ratio. If anyone wants to investigate this further feel free to
contact us to get the file or get it on MISP/VT.

Action on Objectives:
About a half hour after successful C2 we see this

We can conclude that ditsnap was most likely run on the DC to obtain a copy of ntds.dit by
creating a snapshot.

4/13

Forty-five minutes later Snatch Team had their first blood. They RDP’ed into the backup
server, turned off Windows Defender, and executed safe.exe. They did this for every
machine in the domain and within 15 minutes all machines were ransomed including the
DCs. All machines rebooted into safe mode before encrypting causing all logging and remote
tools to fail (Damn you safe mode!).

On all machines we are left with the following:

Snatch Team requested 40k USD for the decryptor but with negotiations we were able to talk
them down to less than 15k.

Recovery:
5/13

Let’s take a minute to think about what recovery would look like in a large organization.
Every server and online machine was rebooted into safe mode without networking which
causes you to lose complete visibility. This gets very painful quickly.

Conclusion:
As we’ve seen time and time again, RDP is being brute forced to gain access into the
network and then the threat actor moves laterally quickly to install ransomware. Although we
were surprised that the threat actors manually RDPed into each system rather than using
GPO or PsExec. Even though this attacker did not seem highly skilled they were productive,
efficient and in less than 5 hours could have earned 40k (8k per hour).

you for your support!

Analysis of Safe.exe:
Safe.exe is a Go based executable, it drops 4 bat files that kick off the ransom process. It
creates a new service to run safe.exe and then sets the system to reboot into safe mode on
next boot and then executes a shutdown of the system ASAP. When the system comes back
up its in Safe Mode without networking.
