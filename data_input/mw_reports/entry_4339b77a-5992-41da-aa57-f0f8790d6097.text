Overview
W32.Flamer is a sophisticated cyber espionage tool that targeted
the Middle East. It is modular in design and contains some novel
functionality, most notably its ability to spread across networks using
a previously unknown man-in-the-middle attack against Windows
Update. Symantec has performed a detailed forensic analysis of two
of the command-and-control (C&C) servers used in the W32.Flamer
attacks from earlier this year.
Based on our analysis, we were able to uncover details such as when
the servers were operational, what entities were targeted, nicknames
of those involved in the attack, and techniques used by the attackers
to avoid discovery should the command-and-control server be
compromised.
Analysis of these C&C servers was performed as a joint effort between
Symantec, CERT-Bund/BSI, IMPACT, and Kaspersky. This paper
focuses on the detailed forensic examination Symantec carried out on
the C&C server images.

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

Background
The first server was set up on May 18, 2012, and, just five hours after it was set up, it recorded the first
interaction with a Flamer-compromised client. The server would go on to control at least a few hundred
compromised clients over the next few weeks. The second server was set up on March 25, 2012, and controlled
over a thousand clients in a period of just over one week.
The servers had been set up to record a minimal amount of information in case of discovery. The systems were
configured to disable any unnecessary logging events and entries in the database were deleted at regular
intervals. Existing log files were securely deleted from the servers on a regular basis. These steps were taken in
order to hamper any investigation should the server fall into the hands of investigators or law enforcement.
However, the attackers were not thorough enough, as files revealing the entire history of the servers’ setup were
available and a limited
Figure 1
set of encrypted records
Data security compartmentalization used by W32.Flamer attackers
in the database revealed
that compromised clients
had been connecting
from the Middle East. We
were also able to recover
the nicknames of four
authors—D***, H*****,
O******, and R***—who
had worked on the code
at various stages and on
differing aspects of the
project.
On both servers commandand-control activity
happens through a
Web application called
Newsforyou. It processes
the W32.Flamer client
interactions and provides
a simple control panel.
The control panel allows
the attackers to upload
packages of code to
deliver to compromised
clients, and download
packages containing
stolen client data.
However, in a technique
not previously seen
before the uploaded and
downloaded packages are
encrypted, so infiltrating
the command-and-control
server does not reveal
the code or the stolen
client data. The command-

and-control server simply serves as a proxy for the data and the data is encrypted and decrypted offline by the
attackers using keys unique to each client. This application also contains functionality to communicate with
clients compromised by malware other than Flamer. The Web application was designed to be a framework for
supporting different malware campaigns.
In addition to avoiding the compromise of their operations, preventing both the uploading of rogue code and
viewing of stolen data, the setup also maintains a clear distinction of roles. The roles include those responsible
for setting up the server (admins), those responsible for uploading packages and downloading stolen data
through the control panel (operators), and those holding the private key with the ability to decrypt the stolen
data (attack coordinators). The operators themselves may actually be completely unaware of the contents in the
stolen data. This is due to design of the process to use data security compartmentalization techniques, as shown
in Figure 1.
Despite these techniques, we were still able to determine that one of the servers delivered a module instructing
Flamer to commit suicide and wipe itself off computers in late May 2012, an action we also witnessed through
compromised honeypots.
Finally, access to the control panel required a password which is stored as a hash. Despite brute force attempts
at reversing the hash to plain text, we were unable to determine the plain text password.
What follows is a thorough analysis of one of the command-and-control servers, detailing the server setup, the
Web application developed by at least four separate authors since 2006, the control panel used by the operators,
and the database that helps drive the application. The report also includes key information about a second
server, but in-depth details have been omitted to maintain the brevity of this report. The functionality and
structure of both servers is identical. The differences are mainly in the amount of data and number of clients the
servers were exposed to.

Server setup
The first sign of activity from the attackers on the first server was May 18, 2012. At 11:26 (UTC) the first
scheduled job was run and a little over two hours later the server was fully operational. A malicious package was
uploaded to the server at 13:53. The first recorded interaction with a W32.Flamer compromised client was at
16:15, when stolen data was uploaded to the server.
In comparison, the second server saw initial activity on March 25, 2012, and was fully operational on the same
day.

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

During the server set up, the attackers installed various applications and tested connections to the MySQL
database which supported their custom Web application. The end goal was to install a command-and-control
application called Newsforyou which interacted with compromised W32.Flamer clients.
An important step taken by the attackers was to hide traces of their activity on the server. They did this by
disabling logging and securely removing existing log files. The attackers, however, did not clear out the history
of commands issued through the console by the administrator (root) account. This data was visible and was
retrieved from the /root/.bash_history file, which revealed these activities. The following table lists and
describes, in brief, a subset of commands that are most relevant to the server set up:

Following these commands, the Apache server was configured to listen on TCP ports 443 and 8080. The firewall
was also reconfigured to allow connections over SSH and HTTPS. Logging activities were disabled and existing
log files were securely deleted where necessary. The server is now ready to interact with compromised Flamer
clients through the Newsforyou application.
The attackers also set up some URL redirections to disguise the true nature of the requests to an inexperienced
eye. They would appear to look like legitimate requests for regular looking folder names. An example of one of
the redirect rules is shown below:
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl

it in a tar archive. The archive
could then be downloaded by the
operators. Eraser.py is a script used
to wipe certain files and content
from folders. On one of the servers
the operators made an error when
setting up the scheduled task. They
used the folder name pycleaner
when creating the task, but this
folder does not exist. The folder
containing the script is pycleanscr.
As a result, the Eraser.py script was
never automatically executed.

Stress testing the application
Simulator
This application consists of a set of Python scripts, which are used to stress test the Newsforyou application.
This application was only present on one of the servers. The application connects to a chosen server and issues
various queries that conform to the C&C server protocol. The tests performed during the set up were to add an
entry (stolen data) and to retrieve a news entry (payload).
A point of interest here is the presence of dnslocation.info as part of the HTTP request header the script builds in
a file named Connection.py. This is a known Flamer C&C server domain, indicating that the code is being shared
and used to test across various C&C servers. The timestamp on this file supports this idea as it is stamped March
22, 2012.

When a Python script is executed, a compiled Python file (.pyc) is generated. Examining these files, we confirmed
this application was executed on May 18 which corroborates our finding about the system configuration date.

Cleaning up
pycleanscr
pycleanscr checks how much free disk space is available on the root partition. It deletes the files in /var/www/
htdocs/newsforyou/tmp/ if the amount of the disk space in use is greater than 75 percent.

Delete.php
Deletes entries in the news_entries table of the MySQL database and securely deletes the files referenced by
that entry on disk that are older than 30 days.

Disabling logging
LogWiper_fixed.txt
This .txt file is renamed to a .sh BASH script and run to disable logging services, to securely delete any prior log
files created, and to disable logging in two particular applications required by the attackers: Apache and SSH.

The next section will discuss the Web application processing the compromised W32.Flamer client requests.

The Web application
Location: /var/www/htdocs/newsforyou/
The Newsforyou application is written in PHP and contains the primary command-and-control functionality split
into two parts: the main module and the control panel. The control panel is a basic user interface which allows
packages to be uploaded and installed on chosen W32.Flamer clients. It also allows for the retrieval of stolen
data that had been uploaded from these clients.

*Symmetric encryption with known key
**Asymmetric encryption with known public key, private key unknown
The application is designed to resemble a simple news/blog application. This approach may serve to disguise
the true nature of the application from any automation or casual inspection. Although the code was running on
a Linux server, it is likely some of the command-and-control servers were running Windows, or at least that the
code was developed and tested on Windows computers.
The following comment was present in one of the PHP files:
-- This function was added by D***, returns a true/false value
depending on if this is a Windows box

Authors
The PHP source code references four authors, identified in the table below, and also attributes to them
particular functionality within the code:

It is clear that D*** and H***** had the most input into the project, having edited the most files in the
application. O****** and R*** were tasked with database and cleanup operations and could easily have had little
or no understanding of the inner workings of the application.
However, D*** and H***** have direct involvement in handling interactions with clients, as they worked on the
protocols and also worked on the control panel that the operators used. It is likely D*** and O****** knew each
other, as they both worked on the same files and during a similar time period in December 2006.

Have I Got Newsforyou: Analysis of Flamer C&C Server

H***** is responsible for the SignupProtocol, while D*** is involved in the OldProtocol (Flamer), both of which
will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

Protocols
The main module communicating with the compromised clients is index.php. It deciphers the protocol then
logs, decodes, and processes requests. Four protocols have been identified, of which three are in use. The Red
protocol has not been implemented yet.
The existence of three supported protocols, along with one protocol under development, confirms the C&C
server’s requirement to communicate with multiple evolutions (variants) of W32.Flamer or additional cyberespionage malware families currently unknown to the public.

The possibility that multiple Trojans, or at least evolutions of W32.Flamer, are at work here is backed up by the
fact that four different IDs are used internally to identify them:

Security Response

Here is a snippet of code that identified connecting clients:

It is likely here that CLIENT_TYPE_SP, CLIENT_TYPE_SPE, and CLIENT_TYPE_FL implemented by D*** are evolutions
of the same threat. However, CLIENT_TYPE_IP which is implemented by H***** appears to come after the in-use
Flamer protocol, which suggests that either new variants exist that we are unaware of, or there is a separate Trojan
at work. They also included an unrecognized fallback for clients.

Stolen Data
Compromised clients upload stolen data to the entries directory. Files stored in this directory are encrypted with a
public key stored in the database. These files cannot be decrypted without the corresponding private key. There was
a file of 157,548 bytes still left on the server that the operators did not have the opportunity to download.
The stolen data is encrypted with this public key on the server, thus requiring the corresponding unknown private key
to decrypt:

A total of around 75 MB of stolen data was found in the backups on one of the servers (server #1). Although the
timing data is limited here, the timestamps of these backups suggest that the operators could be in the EMEA region.
There was a four-day delay from the initial setup to when the operators began to retrieve stolen data. This is a
possible indicator that the information about the new server had to take time to filter down to them.

Megabytes of stolen data by date, server #1

Activity
By examining the files in the bak directories, specifically the number of files contained within the backup archives
created each day, it is possible to obtain an indication of the activity of the C&C server, which can be seen in the
chart below:
Figure 4.1

Number of backup archives created each day, server #1

Figure 4.2

Number of backup archives created each day, server #2

On the first server, there is a clear increase in activity around May 20, which then drops off. This is to be expected as
computers are cleared up.
On the second server the Flamer operation is in full flow and huge volumes of files are being created on the system.

Payload
The news directory contains a compressed and encrypted file for distribution to the compromised clients connecting
to the server. This file is encrypted with a known symmetric key retrieved from the database.

malware from the compromised client.
The payload is encrypted with this symmetric key:

Access to the Flamer control panel requires authentication:

Username: username
Password Hash: 27934e96d90d06818674b98bec7230fa
The control panel for interacting with Flamer-compromised computers is very basic. The simple interface allows the
operators to upload packages and download encrypted data stolen from the compromised clients. The operator is
required to upload specially crafted tar.gz files. The archived filename needs to follow a specific format, which is
parsed and then stored in the ads or news directory, depending on the file extension used.
The filename format for these packages is as follows:
[USER _ TYPE] _ [USER _ ID] _ [PRIORITY] _ [TEMP _ FLAG][OPTIONAL _ AND _ IGNORED].news
[USER _ TYPE] _ [USER _ ID] _ [EXPIRY _ TIME] _ [AD _ NAME].ad

The following is a screen shot of the control panel that allows the operator to upload data to the server:
Figure 6

Control panel data upload screen

This approach to uploading packages and downloading data fits the profile of military and intelligence operations.
A typical control panel is easy to use and self-explanatory. The operator has full control over what to do with the
compromised clients and has the ability to retrieve and inspect the stolen information. The Flamer control panel
provides limited capabilities to the operator, preventing them from viewing and interpreting the information being
exchanged.
This approach would help prevent operators from knowing what is contained within the packages or the significance
of the data being exchanged between clients and the attackers. Such a design would also serve as a defensive
measure as it would prevent arbitrary packages from being uploaded and prevent downloaded data being from being
inspected by unknown parties that may have gained access to the control panel.
The following screen on the control panel allows the user to view and download backed up data from the server:

compromised clients), the database reveals that 189 records had been created. The other 188 files had already been
removed from the server. The entry left on the server had been successfully stolen from the computer located in
Israel.
A final point to note here is in relation to the entry in the news_entries table. Only one record ever existed: the
malicious payload to clean the computers up, uploaded on May 18, 2012, at 13.43:45. This server only served up one
package and it was uploaded as soon as the server had been initially configured. The last time a compromised client
connected to the server was Friday, June 1, 2012, at 11:42:47, and the last log recorded in the database was Friday,
June 1, 2012, at 11:46:01.

Conclusion
Examining the W32.Flamer servers has provided additional insight into the architecture of not only the threat, but
also into the command structure of the entities behind it. The server code was written and updated by at least four
separate individuals, indicating a continuing development effort to support W32.Flamer and, potentially, new or
additional threats of a similar nature. The command-and-control Web application has been in active development for
many years, possibly as early as 2006, which is well before Flamer’s earliest seen compilation date in 2010.
The operators of the C&C servers may be a group of less senior individuals, working on a need-to-know basis, as the
operator is not required (nor has the permission) to interpret the value or purpose of the incoming data. Only the
attackers have the permission to access and interpret this data. This separation of operational and attacker visibility
and roles indicates that this is the work of a highly organized and sophisticated group. The likelihood of a large and
well-funded entity’s involvement in Flamer is corroborated by the use of the unique certificate weakness used to
hijack the Windows Update feature to spread across networks.
They were also careful to unload and archive data where necessary, remove duplicate files, and delete unnecessary
files to prevent the server from running out of disk space. This was an ongoing development up to 2011. R***’s edits
in the source code suggest the concern was less about updating protocols and more about ensuring there was ample
room on the servers for the stolen data to be uploaded to, begging the question of how much data was actually being
stolen.
This investigation simply provides a snapshot in time of the Flamer attack campaign. Considering that logging was
disabled and data was wiped clean in such a thorough manner, the remaining clues make it virtually impossible to
determine the entity behind the campaign. There is little doubt that the larger project involving cyber-espionage
tools, such as Flamer, will continue to evolve and retrieve information from the designated targets.
