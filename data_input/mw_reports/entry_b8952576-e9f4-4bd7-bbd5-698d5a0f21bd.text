overview of the attack and what we know so far!
After little more than a month of
reprieve, the infosec community is, once
again, back into it. This time the target,
though, is even more prevalent than
SolarWinds’ Orion. Now the target is
Microsoft’s Exchange, and the exploited
vulnerability allows for remote code
execution (or RCE). We’ve distilled
down the facts of the HAFNIUM attack
to answer the most important questions.

What We Know So Far about HAFNIUM
Who Are They?
On 2 March 2021, Microsoft released a blog article detailing a new threat actor it had dubbed
HAFNIUM. Microsoft, the blog identified, has observed the actor exploiting several 0-day
vulnerabilities.
Microsoft also highlighted that the HAFNIUM group had previously targeted other
organizations. The group, Microsoft identified, has focused on the exploitation of Internetfacing services in the past.
Later that same day, the company Volexity also released a blog article. In their article, they
identified that they observed the attacks beginning as early as 3 January 2021.

Hot on the heels of the Microsoft and Volexity blogs, other vendors began to contribute
information. On 4 March 2021, FireEye’s Mandiant Intelligence release their own blog post.
In it, FireEye identified that they tracked the activity under three separate activity clusters:
UNC2639
UNC2640
UNC2643
One particularly important point in this blog article is that FireEye detected this activity all the
way back in January 2021. The article also highlighted various TTPs and tools the actors
used. This included:
ASPXSPY
Covenant
China Chopper
Nishang
PowerCat
Cobalt Strike
They also described the actors’ method of deploying webshells on compromised Exchange
servers. These webshells were unique though. The webshells detected the presence of
specific security products and warn the actors. The security products it detected included
FireEye, Carbon Black and Crowdstrike. They described the actors technique of dropping
more complex webshells over time. This appears to be to avoid detection.
In time, other vendors have also come forward, including Symantec. They identified that they
track HAFNIUM, under the name Ant.
Where is HAFNIUM From?
Attribution can be a tricky topic in cyber threat intelligence. Despite this fact, several sources,
including Microsoft, have indicated that the HAFNIUM group is “… state-sponsored and
operating out of China …”
Who is Being Targeted?
At this point, the targeting of HAFNIUM appears opportunistic. Indeed, since Microsoft
released their initial blog, the actors have “… stepped up attacks on any vulnerable,
unpatched Exchange servers (2013, 2016, and 2019) worldwide.” The HAFNIUM group,
though, has targeted organizations in the past.
As both Microsoft and FireEye mentioned, HAFNIUM is a group with a bit of track record.
Microsoft identified that they have targeted several industries in the past. These included
Infectious disease research

Law firms
Universities
Defense contractors
Think tanks
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
FireEye also mentioned that they had observed several industries affected by the new
attack, including
Retailers
Local Governments
Universities
Engineering Firms
They also identified that there is possible related activity observed in Asia as well
Federal governments
Telecommunications providers
What Are The Actors Doing?
Since early January, the actors have been exploiting several 0-day vulnerabilities in
Exchange. The vulnerabilities, which affect on-premise versions of Microsoft Exchange only,
are:
CVE-2021-26855
CVE-2021-26857
CVE-2021-26858
CVE-2021-27065
Once the actors establish a foothold in the environment, they will deploy one or more web
shells. These are small bits of code that gives the actors control over the system. Once in the
environment, the actors use a variety of techniques.

When Did All This Happen?
Reporting from both FireEye and Volexity state that the attacks were first observed in
January. It is unknown whether this was the start of the campaign.
The bulk of the campaign appears to have taken place over February and March 2021.
What Should I Do?
What you should do next will likely depend on a few factors.
Cyborg Security has released new advanced detection content through its Community
Defense Measures (CDM) project. This content will alert organization to malicious
behaviors related to the attacks.
Microsoft has released a tool that will scan Exchange logs for suspicious and malicious
modifications.
Microsoft has also released security updates for Microsoft Exchange
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has also released Alert
AA21-062A. An important note about this is that CISA warns organizations: “… [if] your
organization [sees] evidence of compromise, your incident response should begin with
conducting forensic analysis to collect artifacts and perform triage ….”
The US’ Department of Homeland Security also issued Emergency Directive 21-02.
