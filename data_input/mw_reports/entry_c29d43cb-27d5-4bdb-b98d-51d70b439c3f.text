Resurgence of Voicemail-themed Phishing Attacks
Targeting Key Industry Verticals in US
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/resurgence-voicemail-themed-phishing-attacks-targeting-key-industry

Summary
Since May 2022, ThreatLabz has been closely monitoring the activities of a threat actor
which targets users in various US-based organizations with malicious voicemail-notificationthemed emails in an attempt to steal their Office365 and Outlook credentials. The tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of this threat actor have a high overlap with a previous
voicemail campaign that ThreatLabz analyzed in July 2020.
In this new instance of the campaign, the threat actor has targeted users in US-based
organizations in specific verticals including software security, US military, security solution
providers, healthcare / pharmaceutical, and the manufacturing supply chain.
As Zscaler was one of the targeted organizations, it gave us a good insight into the full
attack chain and motives of this threat actor.

Key points
Voicemail-themed phishing campaigns continue to be a successful social engineering
theme used by this threat actor to lure victims in opening a malicious attachment.
Multiple key industry verticals in the US such as military, software security vendors,
healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and the manufacturing supply chain were targeted by
this threat actor.

1/9

The goal of the threat actor is to steal credentials of Office365 and Outlook accounts,
both of which are widely used in large enterprises.
A CAPTCHA is used by the threat actor to guard the final credential phishing page
from automated URL analysis algorithms.
Each URL is specifically crafted for the targeted individual and the targeted
organization.
The campaign is active at the time of publishing this report.

Attack chain
The attack flow involves a voicemail-themed notification email sent to the victim. The email
contains an HTML attachment which, when opened, will redirect the user to a credential
phishing site. The goal of the threat actor is to harvest Office 365 credentials of the victim.
We will describe each component of the attack-chain in more detail in this report.

Attack chain [Technical analysis]
Email analysis
The email theme is focused on a voicemail notification that tells the victim they have a
missed voicemail, promting the user to open the HTML attachment. This social engineering
technique has worked successfully for the threat actor in previous campaigns.
Figure 1 shows an example of the email sent to the victim. The "From" field of the email
was crafted specifically to align with the targeted organization's name.

Analysis of the email headers shows that the threat actor leveraged email servers located in
Japan. Figure 2 shows the headers for one of the emails.

HTML attachment analysis
For the purpose of analysis, we will consider the HTML attachment with the MD5 hash:
dd0ddbc951de5cad9c8ace516c514693
Figure 4 shows the HTML attachment sent in the email which contains encoded JavaScript.

URL analysis
[Stage-1 URL] - Redirector
The URL inside the HTML attachment is a redirector URL which redirects the user to the
final credential phishing page.
In each instance of the attack, the URL followed a consistent format which included the
name of the targeted organization as well as the email address of the targeted individual.
Figure 6 below highlights the format.

Figure 6: Stage-1 URL format

5/9

For instance, when an individual in Zscaler was targeted, the URL used the following
format:
zscaler.zscaler.briccorp[.]com/<base64_encoded_email>
Since the format of the URL gives away critical information about the target, we used that
information from our collected telemetry to enumerate the list of targeted organizations and
individuals.
Based on analysis of this telemetry, we can conclude with a high confidence level that the
targets chosen by the threat actor are organizations in the US military, security software
developers, security service providers, healthcare / pharmaceutical and supply-chain
organizations in manufacturing and shipping.
It is important to note that if the URL does not contain the base64-encoded email at the
end; it instead redirects the user to the Wikipedia page of MS Office or to office.com.

[Stage 2 URL] CAPTCHA check
The Stage 1 URL in the HTML attachment will redirect the user to the Stage 2 URL which
requires the user to solve a Captcha before presenting the actual Office credential phishing
page.
For Captcha, it uses the Google reCAPTCHA technique. This helps the threat actor evade
automated URL analysis tools. A similar technique was used in the July 2020 instance of a
voicemail-themed campaign.
Figure 7 and 8 show 2 examples of captcha displayed by the Stage 2 URLs.

[Stage 3 URL] - Credential phishing page
Once the user solves the Captcha successfully, they will be redirected to the final credential
phishing page which attempts to steal the Office 365 credentials of the user as shown in
Figure 9.

Conclusion
Voicemail-themed phishing campaigns continue to be a successful social engineering
technique for attackers since they are able to lure the victims to open the email
attachments. This combined with the usage of evasion tactics to bypass automated URL
analysis solutions helps the threat actor achieve better success in stealing the users'
credentials.
As an extra precaution, users should not open attachments in emails sent from untrusted or
unknown sources. As a best practice, in general, users should verify the URL in the address
bar of the browser before entering any credentials.
The Zscaler ThreatLabz team will continue to monitor this campaign, as well as others, to
help keep our customers safe.
