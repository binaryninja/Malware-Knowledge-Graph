“It’s the start, I should tell you now, of a very, very, clever knot.” (from the BBC’s Tinker Tailor

On 22 October, 2020, the U.S. government issued an alert (AA20–296A) for a widespread
campaign of malicious activity by a Russian state-sponsored cyber operations entity tracked
under a variety of industry monikers. This activity took place between at least September
2020 and October 2020, with its targeting focused on a large volume of entities associated
with U.S. state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) networks and aviation sector networks. The
Russian entity named as responsible has been linked to Russia’s Federal Security Service
(FSB) by the Washington Post in connection to past activity attributed by the U.S.
government to “Russian government cyber actors” and by the New York Times in relation to
AA20–296A; for the sake of argument let’s say that attribution is plausible, if not correct.
(*For additional context, Joe Slowik has also published an exceptional blog on the history
and implications of this entity and its operations.) I’d rather not try to summarize all the
activity described in the alert here, but instead to address its operational logic and how it can
be taken as a likely exemplar of Russian active measures: an insidious blend of offensive
counterintelligence and influence operations that, in the words of George Smiley, “would be
beautiful in another context.”
The operation’s apparent targeting parameters provide our first clear clue. While the scope
was clearly focused geographically on the United States and sectorally on SLTT-related
entities, the described scale — in both the text of the alert (e.g., “wide variety of U.S.
targets”, “targeted dozens of SLTT government and aviation networks”, a one-off reference to
at least one apparent education sector target likely related to SLTT networks) and a
*subsequently published heat map — is relatively large. To my eye, an operation so large
against that target scope casts some doubt on as to how much actual value its operators
reasonably could have expected to draw from the activity if the intention was intelligence
collection in advance of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020. Regardless of if it
relied on the same logic, the U.S. government seems to have arrived at a similar conclusion,
not mentioning a possible collection motive but rather that “…the actor may be seeking
access to obtain future disruption options, to influence U.S. policies and actions, or to
delegitimize SLTT government entities.”
I would take that conclusion a bit further. I believe these targeting parameters suggest a
different motive than either intelligence collection or acquiring network/system disruption
options, because in either case — facing the election day time crunch — the actor would
focus their targeting much more narrowly if they really needed to deliver results. I am
disinclined to believe the FSB (for the sake of argument) would invest the time and effort
required of such a large operation, so close to a major event of strategic significance (i.e.,
the U.S. presidential election), if it was really meant as a shotgun approach to acquire
options or data. If those requirements existed, they would’ve certainly predated September
2020 and been the subject of more highly-targeted activity before autumn.
Our second clue is the tradecraft employed: exploit-chaining that relies on the “CVE greatest
hits” of the last few years. Given the aforementioned asymmetries within the targeting
parameters, the picture I see emerging is something akin to the actor artificially constructing

2/5

a game reserve and then opportunistically hunting within it. The targeting parameters are the
game reserve: entities in the United States, associated with SLTT government no matter how
tangentially. The heavy reliance on exploit chaining — easily enough automated — is the
opportunistic hunting, so opportunistic that it borders on indiscriminate. Yet it remains
confined to the boundaries of the artificial reserve. With that kind of model, a viable goal
emerges in my mind: the offensive counterintelligence effect known as degradation.
I have previously talked about the potential degradation functions of large-scale targeted
intrusion campaigns. Such campaigns require defensive efforts to be expended by a large
group of particular public and private sector entities. From initial incident responders
potentially all the way up to senior government officials, this effort ripples upward and
outward as it gathers steam. From a counterintelligence perspective, this exertion and the
anxieties that accompany it serve the function of frustrating an adversary on multiple levels.
(In an academic sense, it is an interesting example of capitalizing on Clausewitzian friction.)
The anxiety element of such friction also presents further exploitable possibilities.
Specifically, an actor could harness the collateral psychological effects of such a
degradation-oriented campaign for the purpose of active measures, including influence
operations, against a wide variety of audiences. In essence, the psychological stress
endured by blue team personnel and decision-makers is both the core degradation effect as
well as the first-order influence impact. The second-order influence impacts would be
directed at any individuals that responders et al. would tell about their trials and tribulations,
including individuals who may inform the press or general public. Thus, the third-order
influence impacts could affect at least a portion of the wider public. And once you are trying
to get average people to wrap their heads around a campaign like that, you can count on
pitfalls of the domestic information environment to help do some of the heavy lifting for the
adversary when it comes to FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) generation. The anxiety that was
primarily designed to wear down security and government communities now has actual
potential to cause alarm among a susceptible percentage of the public.
Do you see where I’m going with this?
I personally think there’s a good chance that the reported activity was intended primarily as a
degradation operation targeting the U.S. government and secondarily as an influence
operation against both the U.S. government and the American public. In that sense, I’m
advocating for the potential motives of “influence U.S. policies and actions” and “delegitimize
SLTT government entities” as described in AA20–296A. I base this on the reported targeting
parameters and tradecraft employed, as well as the effects possible from both
counterintelligence- and active measures-oriented operational planning perspectives. To
return to my earlier metaphor: the opportunistic hunting within the chosen game reserve in
such close temporal proximity to the election would present ideal conditions for that rippleupward-and-outward anxiety that is so ripe for exploitation. In particular, the politicization of

3/5

the integrity of the election presents some extraordinary opportunities for undermining faith in
democratic institutions — to include elections and their outcomes — and maybe sow a little
general chaos in the process. It would be most Chekist in its logic.
There is, again to paraphrase le Carré’s Smiley, a last clever knot. I think of it as a dead
man’s switch for the influence operation goals of this activity. It revolves around whether or
not the activity is disclosed and ensuring some level of effects across a variety of scenarios.
If the activity is discovered but not publicly disclosed, at least the first-order targets and some
of the second-order targets have been impacted. If the activity is made public by entities
other than the U.S. government, then first-order, second-order, and third-order target sets are
impacted to at least some degree. If the U.S. government chooses to disclose the activity, all
three orders of targets are impacted and the potential for general alarm among the public
increases because an official government announcement almost guarantees a greater
minimum level of public consumption (including via media amplification). It even may be the
actor’s intent to make this latter potential evident in some way to government decisionmakers as an attempt to create a disclination to disclose or attribute the activity, knowing that
internal debate over what course of action to take could intensify friction within relevant
government entities.
However, that third option — disclosure and attribution by the U.S. government — offers
significant positive trade-offs that could counter the some of the intended effects of such
activity, if done properly. Being the first to disclose, and disclosing in sufficient detail, would
grant the U.S. government a strong opportunity to set the narrative and in doing so
potentially engage in some meaningful inoculation of the general public against
misunderstanding, manipulation, and panic. It also presents a chance to throw the adversary
off their operational timelines, as a bit of retaliatory degradation. There of course remains the
very real risk that the actor responsible may still leverage knowledge gained in this activity in
a variety of ways both during and after election day (e.g., so-called “perception hacks”, hackand-leak operations, website defacements, system/network disruptions, etc.); however, those
possibilities would exist regardless of if the underlying activity was disclosed or not.
*There also exists the risk that domestic actors, not just the foreign ones associated with the
SLTT-targeted intrusion activity, could attempt to use the existence of the aforementioned
activity to bolster independent efforts (e.g., legal challenges, influence narratives, etc.) meant
call into question the validity of the outcome of the election. Kudos to Kyle Ehmke for
pointing out this very important point. It is likely that the actor responsible for the activity
covered in AA20–296A anticipated, and even desired, that their actions could be potentially
exploited in such a manner by domestic actors.
In the spirt of that third option well-executed, I believe the 22 October disclosure represents a
meaningful response to Russian active measures. Some may view it as a pyrrhic victory in
the absence of some kind of tangible cost imposition like indictments or disruption of
adversary networks, but to take that stance ignores the more intangible, subtle dynamics
likely at play. To be clear — I do not attempt to say the theory I’ve outlined definitely is what
4/5

this activity represents, merely that I think there is sufficient evidence to make a good case
for it. In the same vein, I must acknowledge there are details about the reported activity that I
do not know and those details could weaken or outright contradict my theory. However, at the
end of the day, I fundamentally remain impressed with the adversary’s apparent logic — at
least from how I perceive it — and feel further secured in the belief that to not respect your
adversary’s capacity for cunning is hubristic.
