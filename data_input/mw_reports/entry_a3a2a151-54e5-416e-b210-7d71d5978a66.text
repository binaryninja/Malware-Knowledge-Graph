The ShadowBrokers is a group of hackers known for leaking exclusive information
about the National Security Agency – NSA’s hacking tools and tactics.
In their latest leak, they have released the UNITEDRAKE NSA exploit, which is a remote
access and control tool that can remotely target Windows-based systems to capture desired
information and transfer it to a server. It captures information using plugins to compromise
webcam and microphone output along with documenting log keystrokes, carrying out
surveillance and access external drives.
The modular malware UNITEDRAKE is compatible with systems running on Microsoft
Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 up to Windows Server 2012. UNITEDRAKE is described as a “fully
extensible” data collection tool that is specifically developed for Windows machines to allow
operators the chance of controlling a device completely.
As cited by ZDNet, the malware modules like FOGGYBOTTOM and GROK can successfully
listen to and monitor communications, and keep a check on keystrokes, webcam, and
microphone. When the task is completed, the malware is able to self-destruct.
Understandably, the NSA developed this tool to carry out mass surveillance and performed
bulk hacking.
We first heard about UNITEDRAKE RAT back in 2014 when former NSA contractor Edward
Snowden exposed an array of confidential documents in a high-profile scandal exposing the
espionage tactics used by the NSA for decades. Snowden revealed a glaring truth related to
NSA spying tactics that the agency had been using multiple malware programs to infect not
hundreds or thousands but millions of computers across the globe to acquire valuable,
sensitive data.
On the other hand, ShadowBrokers group made headlines in 2016 when it claimed to have
robbed various exploitation tools used by the NSA including the notorious ETERNALBLUE
that was a vital component in the WannaCry ransomware campaign causing damages to
systems worldwide. The claim was proved to be authentic by security experts as well.
ShadowBrokers has now decided to release two data dumps every month dubbed as the
Monthly Dump Service. For its latest data dump, the group is expecting to receive 500
Zcash, a type of cryptocurrency, which facilitates secure, private transactions. It is worth
noting that the current rate of Zcash is US$248 per unit or A$309.50 per unit.

The data dump also includes a UNITEDRAKE manual, which means the group is trying to
generate additional interest among cyber criminals, vendors, and government groups to
subscribe to services which provide access to the stolen exploits and malware models.
According to ShadowBrokers, five NSA data dumps are in the pipeline currently and the
group is demanding a whopping 16,000 Zcash for files to be released on November 15.
Moreover, to further enlarge the profits, ShadowBrokers intend to make previous data dumps
available again for purchase and this time the price range will be somewhere between 100
ZEC ($24,000) and 1600 ZEC ( $3.8m).
The group’s subscription service is currently operating discreetly. However, the members
have started complaining about the tools not working as expected. A few months back one of
its subscribers came out in public and complained that the “Wine of the month” club was a
fake scheme.
