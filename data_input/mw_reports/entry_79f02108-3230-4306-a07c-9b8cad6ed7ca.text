Two Common View on Cyber-Physical
Attacks
• “Trivial! Look at the state of ICS
security!”
• “Borderline impossible! These
processes are extremely complex
& engineered for safety!”

Attacks with Strategic and Long Lasting
Effect
• Attacks with strategic, lasting damage will be process specific
& require good process comprehension
• Wil require attacker to develop detailed ‘damage scenario’
− What causes a pipeline to explode?

− What causes the right pipeline to explode?
− What causes the right pipeline to explode at the right
moment?

rd
Targeting 3 parties (supply chain)

• Getting access to into target facilities
• Getting access to needed assets/equipment,
−E.g. through maintenance support contracts

• Obtaining information related to target or
potential victims
−Engineering/networking/config documentation
−User application (control logic), etc.

Data Exposure is Penalizable in Regulated
Facilities
• NERC CIP-003-3 standard
• Sensitive utility’s network
infrastructure data were
exposed via server of thirdparty service provider

© 2019

Role of Access Stage
• Access stage largely defines the selection
of damage scenario
• Access driven
−E.g., obtained access to specific equipment
via 3rd party remote maintenance contract
−Did not manage to access Safety Systems

• Information driven
−E.g., obtained specific information about
unhealthy state or repairs of equipment
© 2019

41

Discovery
• Network reconnaissance
• Majority of this stage is similar to traditional IT
recon process/attack life cycle, tools may differ
• Information enumeration

• Process comprehension
• Understanding exactly what the process is doing,
how it is built, configured and programmed

• Water treatment process consists of multiple stages, including
several stages of filtering
• Water filters are expensive
• When broken, water supply is interrupted

How Do We Pull This off?
• There are tree conditions which can trigger backwash
process, each guided by a state machine
• Preset timer (every 30 minutes)
• UF filter differential pressure (DP) ≥ 40 kPa
• Plant shutdown

• Explosions (of course!)
• Equipment breakage

• Product Out of Specification
• Increased production costs, etc.

Cleanup
• In traditional hacking it is possible to execute the
entire attack without being ever detected
• In process control it is not an option because of
physical effect

• Create forensic footprint of what the investigators
should identify as cause of the incident/accident
−E.g. time attack to process troubleshooting

Why Implant?

Implant
“Hardware or software modification
designed to gain unauthorized control
over specific system functionality.”

OT Payload
“Digital implementation of (part of) a
cyber-physical attack”

Why Implant
• Why not just modify control logic / change setpoints / send
malicious command?
• For more complicated attacks
•

Coordination, Feedback, Speed, Low-level functionality access

• Many scenarios possible without implants

How to Implant?

We want smooth native code execution
• Need access to low-level, privileged functionality
• Memory-/Port-Mapped IO (MMIO/PMIO)
• Kernel memory objects
• Logic runtime memory
• Persistence mechanisms

• Ideally via silent hot-patching
• No reboots, no service restarts, no process upsets

I/O Manipulation

Complication: Field Device Limitations
• Cyber limitations might be placed on theoretically feasible
functionality for protective reasons*
• Valve closing speed
• Non-digitally alterable VFD skip frequences

• Prevents IO manipulation from achieving desired result
• Overcoming this requires implanting field device
• Patch out limitations / sanity checks

Alarm Suppression

Alarm Suppression
• Again: simple concept, non-trivial execution
• We want to prevent an outgoing alarm being raised or
incoming alarm being acted upon

• Might require very different approaches
• Alarm raised with dedicated protocol message
• Alarm signal via IO
• Alarm bit in flag accompanying read PV

Alarm Relaxation &
Tightening

Why relax or tighten instead of suppress?
• Don’t prevent alarm from being raised but change
conditions
• Limits, deadband, priority

• Relax: Stealth during scheduled testing
• Tighten: Cause hard-to-resolve alarm storms

118

Hook functionality that decides whether
to raise alarm
• Can be data (limit, priority, deadband): overwrite in RAM
• Make sure to spoof values when queried!

• Or code (alarm logic): patch instructions

Implant Communication

Implants need to synchronize

4. Change
agitator speed

2. Change air /
medium inflow

1. Process state A
3. Process state B
Pressure, temperature, pH,
moisture, …

Expectation vs Reality

These can be in completely
different parts of the process,
on different networks

Might not see much electronic
chatter after implanting
