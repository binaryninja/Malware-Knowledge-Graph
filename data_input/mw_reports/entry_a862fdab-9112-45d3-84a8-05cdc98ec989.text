MuddyWater’s “light” first-stager targetting Middle East
lab52.io/blog/muddywaters-light-first-stager-targetting-middle-east/

Since the last quarter of 2020 MuddyWater has mantained a “long-term” infection campaign
targeting Middle East countries. We have gathered samples from November 2020 to January
2022, and due to the recent samples found, it seems that this campaign might still be
currently active. The latest campaigns of the Muddy Water threat group, allegedly sponsored
by the Iranian government and linked to the Iranian revolutionary guard (the main armed
forces of the Iranian government), could be framed within the dynamics of maintaining Iran’s
regional sovereignty.
This infection campaign always starts with a compressed file wrapping a malicious Word
document containing VBA macros.

document sample
While our oldest sample looks a little more sophisticated based on the content of the
document, which seems more specifically crafted for Arabic speakers as shown in the
previous image, the rest of them contain generic English message to enable macros.

Although it has not been possible to clearly identify their specific target, it has been observed
that these campaigns have been directed against countries such as Pakistan, Kazahstan,
Armenia, Syria, Israel, Bahrain, Turkey, South Africa, Sudan, etc. Many of these countries
may be of interest to the alleged Iranian threat actor, as some of them have been involved in
recent internal conflicts, or are implicated in nuclear energy improvement, or may serve as
strategic footholds for the development and influence of Iranian interests in other parts of the
world.

The macros are very concise and their only purpose is to write a not-so-much obfuscated
VBS script into a file located in C:\ProgramData or the Windows Startup folder, with names
such as Temp_[3-5 random chars].txt.

Malicious VBA macro code
The dropped script is a small RAT which allows to execute commands via cmd. It first calls a
recon function which executes whoami, and sets a country code which is already present in
the script. The result of this will then be part of the URI used for the C2 contact. The set of
different country codes found in the gathered samples are the following, and might indeed
reveal the targets for each campaign:
PK –> Pakistan
AR –> Argentina

AM –> Armenia
SY –> Syria
IL –> Israel
BH –> Bahrain
TR –> Turkey
SA –> Saudi Arabia
SD –> Sudan
KK –> Kazakhstan

After building the recon string, it will execute its main function. This function first executes
explorer.exe (without apparent functional reason), and then calls a function to choose one IP
from an array which will rotate in case of the chosen IP not replying to the subsequent C2
connection. This connection to the C2 server will use an HTTP GET request using the
following structure:
http://{ IP_address }/getCommand?guid={ recon_string }

HTTP GET

communication from VBS sample
As aforementioned, in the case of an empty reply, it will rotate the IP address and try again
with the next. Otherwise it will deobfuscate the reply and call a function to execute it by
creating a WScript.Shell object to call cmd:

As also seen on the deobfuscated snippet, it will output the result into a txt file and
immediately read its content to return it to the calling function in order to include the result
and send it to the C2 server. The next contact will use the POST HTTP method and will
follow a slightly different structure and the command output in the body:
http://{ IP_address }/getTargetInfo?guid={ recon_string }&status={ flag_value }

HTTP POST

communication from VBS sample
Interestingly, the value renamed by us as “flag_value” will be included as the “state” value
within the POST request. In the script file, it is a variable that is initialized to 0 in every
collected sample, and is always set to 1 before executing the received command and
sending the result in the POST request. Other than this, it is not modified or used in the script
file. However, it is checked during the renamed “whoami_wrap” for the initial host recon at
the beginning of the script. It is compared with the value 126, and in case of resolving True, it
will display the following message box.

Malicious VBS

“alternative functionality”
The only implemented functionality in every analyzed sample is the #1, which will use WMI to
display the following information about the infected system:

Code snippet for the “alternative functionality”
Such a small script with incomplete functionality, after almost two years being used for
different campaigns could suggest that the attackers might modify its functionality in a later
stage, based on the obtained information from the infected host or, at least, use it to
download and drop the next infection stage.
