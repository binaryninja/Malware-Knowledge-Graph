Unpatched Exchange servers distribute phishing links

Beginning of November a customer reached out to us. Internal and external users reported
suspicious mails sent from their mail accounts, which included suspicious links. These mails
were sent as replies to messages already sent in the past, which made them appear
legitimate.
First it was confirmed in the mail headers that the mail originated from the customers
Exchange and was not spoofed from external sources. While further investigating the root
cause it turned out that the on-premise MS Exchange server had not received updates for
several months. Thus, it was affected by multiple vulnerabilities, e.g. “ProxyShell” (CVE2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207) and “ProxyLogon” (CVE-2021-26855).
The IIS logs showed that special crafted server-side request forgery (SSRF) requests were
used to exploit CVE-2021-26855, directed at the Exchange Web Services API endpoint. This
allowed the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users.
The corresponding IIS log lines looked like this:

2021-11-01 19:50:59 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.json
a=a@edu.edu/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml?=&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json?
a=a@edu.edu&CorrelationID=<empty>;&cafeReqId=1b241d99-89e8-4cfa-8b3c-f96c1ef40cf0;
443 - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Mozilla/5.0+(Windows+NT+10.0;+WOW64)+AppleWebKit/537.36+
(KHTML,+like+Gecko)+Chrome/92.0.4515.131+Safari/537.36. - 200 0 0 345

One thing that was also noticeable in the Exchange Logs is that the “ItemClass” of all mails
created by the attacker was set to “IPM.Blabla”.

This allowed us to filter these mails in Outlook. However, this only worked for mailboxes of
users who received these suspicious emails. We did not find emails in the “sent” folders of
affected users. The pictures below show two mail accounts.

The format of the censored URLs conformed to the following regex pattern: [a-z]+\.[az0-9]+\.com\/[a-z]+\/[a-z]+-[0-9]+

Example: sdf.wwkwe.com/tatamua/uzaro-3381926

2/3

No malware could be identified on the Exchange server in the course of a quick analysis.
Other forensic investigations came to a similar conclusion [1]. However, no full forensic
analysis was conducted during this investigation.
Later it turned out that other organizations [1] were affected by similar attacks, seemingly
related to an attack campaign titled “squirrelwaffle” [2].
We recommend everyone to update internet-facing applications in short cycles and apply
patches as soon as possible after their release. Due to the high attack surface of the
Microsoft Exchange product (multiple critical vulnerabilities have been published this year), it
is also recommended to block access to the web interface from the internet and use a VPN if
access from the internet is required.
