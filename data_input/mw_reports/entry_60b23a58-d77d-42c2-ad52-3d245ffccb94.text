SideWinder Uses South Asian Issues for Spear Phishing, Mobile

SideWinder Uses South Asian Issues for Spear Phishing, Mobile Attacks

We also found multiple Android APK les on their phishing server. While some

Archives 

of them are benign, we also discovered malicious les created with Metasploit.
One of the normal applications, called “OpinionPoll,” is a survey app for
gathering opinions regarding the Nepal-India political map dispute, which
seems to be another political lure similar to the one they used in the spearphishing portion. We believe these applications are still under development
and will likely be used to compromise mobile devices in the future.

SideWinder has been very active in 2020. Earlier this year, we published a
report on how the SideWinder APT group used the Binder exploit to attack
mobile devices. The group also launched attacks against Pakistan, Bangladesh,
and China using lure les related to Covid-19.

Analysis of the malicious document
The use of malicious documents is one of SideWinder’s most common
infection vectors. We collected several di erent samples from the campaign,
including:

1.

An LNK le that downloads an RTF le and drops a JavaScript le

2.

A ZIP le containing an LNK le, which downloads an HTA le (with

JavaScript)

3.

An RTF le that drops a JavaScript le

4.

A PDF le with an embedded JavaScript stream

5.

A DOCX le with an external link to an OLE object (RTF le), which

contains and drops a JavaScript le

Figure 1. An example of a downloaded ZIP le containing an LNK le that is used to download a malicious
HTA le

All of these cases end up with either the downloading or dropping of les and
then the execution of JavaScript code, which is a dropper used to install the
main backdoor + stealer.

The downloaded RTF les exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. It drops a
le named 1.a (a JavaScript code), which drops the backdoor + stealer into a
folder in ProgramData and directly executes it or creates a scheduled task to
execute the dropped les at a later time.

Figure 2. A scheduled task with a command to execute the dropped backdoor + stealer

The content of the newly created folder contains a few les, including
Rekeywiz (EFS REKEY wizard,
FA86B5BC5343CA92C235304B8DCBCF4188C6BE7D4621C625564BEBD5326E

Figure 3. List of dropped les

This application loads various system DLL libraries, including shell32.dll, which
sideloads DUser.dll, one of shell32’s DelayImports.

Figure 4. DUser library as DelayImport of shell32 library

However, a fake DUser.dll gets loaded into the process. This fake DLL library
decrypts the main backdoor + stealer from the .tmp le in the same directory.

Figure 5. Algorithm for decrypting both main backdoor + stealer and con guration

The decryption process is a simple XOR, where the key is the rst 32 bytes
from the encrypted le and the payload are the remaining bytes. The
decrypted payload is the main backdoor .NET executable binary.

Figure 6. Decrypted main SystemApp with listing its classes and resources

In Resources, the Default resource contains the encrypted con guration.
After decryption (using the same principle as with the main backdoor +
stealer), the con guration reveals which le formats the attackers are
targeting.

Figure 7. The decrypted con guration

The main functions of the backdoor + stealer are:
1) Downloading the .NET executable and running it
2) Collecting system information and uploading it to the command-and-control
(C&C) server
3) Uploading selected les to the C&C server

The collected information is in JSON format (hence why the Newtonsoft_Json
library stored in Resources is loaded) and includes information such as
privileges, user accounts, computer system information, antivirus programs,
running processes, processor information, operating system information,
timezone, installed Windows updates, network information, list of directories in
Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop, Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads,
Users\%USERNAME%\Documents, Users\%USERNAME%\Contacts, as well as
information on all drives and installed apps.

The spear-phishing attack
We found several interesting dynamic DNS domains resolving to a server that
was used to deliver SideWinder’s malicious documents. The subdomains of
these dynamic DNS domains are designed to be similar to the domains of their
victims’ mail servers. For example, “mail-nepalgovnp[.]duckdns[.]org” was
created to pretend to be the original Nepal government’s domain
“mail[.]nepal[.]gov[.]np”. Digging deeper, we found that it hosted several
phishing pages.

These pages were copied from the webmail servers of various targets and then
modi ed for spear-phishing attacks designed to steal login credentials.
Although it’s not clear to us how these phishing pages are delivered to the
victims, nding the original webmail servers that they copied to make these
phishing pages allows us to identify who they were targeting.

Analysis of the phishing pages revealed that most of them would redirect to
the original webmail servers, which they copied after the victims sent out their
login credentials. However, we also found some of them will either redirect to
documents or news pages. These documents and news are probably
interesting in some way to their targets and are used to make them click and
log in to the phishing pages. While several of the documents are related to

Android applications
We also identi ed multiple Android APK les on their server. Interestingly,
these Android applications still seem to be under the initial development
phase as they are basic, still use the default Android icons, and have no
practical function for users.

SideWinder Uses South Asian Issues for Spear Phishing, Mobile Attacks

We noticed two applications among them, named “My First APP” and “Opinion
Poll,” that seemingly have no malicious behavior. My First APP demonstrates
login & register processes, while Opinion Poll acts as an opinion polling
application for the Indian-Nepalese political map dispute. The rst application
is likely an Android demo application for beginners, while the second one
starts with an explanation of “Opinion Writing,” followed by a survey.

Figure 12. Non-malicious applications “My First APP” and “Opinion Poll”

Another two applications were built from JavaPayload for Metasploit that will
load extra code from the remote server con gured in the sample. While we
were unable to retrieve the payload, according to the Manifest that requests
numerous privacy-related permissions like location, contacts, call logs, etc., we
can infer that it goes after the user’s private data. These two samples appear
to be debug versions as they have no activities or any other component except
Metasploit.

SideWinder Uses South Asian Issues for Spear Phishing, Mobile Attacks

SideWinder has used malicious apps as part of its operation before. In the
campaign referenced earlier, the group used malicious APKs disguised as
photography and le manager tools to lure users into downloading them.
Once downloaded into the user’s mobile device, the malicious APKs launch a
series of fairly sophisticated procedures that includes rooting the device to
stealthily deploy the payload, as well as exploiting CVE-2019-2215 and
MediaTek-SU vulnerabilities for root privileges. The payload’s ultimate goal is to
gather information from the compromised device and then send it back to its
C&C server.

In the case of these newer APKs, it seems that the goal is to gather user
information as well. Unlike the earlier apps, which were already on the Google
Play Store, all the APK les found on their server are not mature enough for a
deliberate attack. In our opinion, these are still in the initial stage, and the
payloads (directed at mobile users) are still being re ned further.

Conclusion
As seen with their phishing attacks and their mobile device tools’ continuous
development, SideWinder is very proactive in using trending topics like Covid19 or various political issues as a social engineering technique to compromise
their targets. Therefore, we recommend that users and organizations be
vigilant and follow social engineering best practices to protect themselves from
these kinds of campaigns.
