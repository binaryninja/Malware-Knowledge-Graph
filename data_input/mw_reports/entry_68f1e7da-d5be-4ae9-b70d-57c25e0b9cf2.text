In democratic societies, elections are the mechanism for choosing heads of state and
policymakers. There are strong incentives for adversary nations to understand the intentions
and preferences of the people and parties that will shape a country's future path and to
reduce uncertainty about likely winners. Mandiant Threat Intelligence regularly observes
cyber espionage operations we believe to be seeking election-related information targeting

governments, civil society, media, and technology organizations around the globe. We have
also seen disruptive and destructive cyber attacks and propaganda campaigns seeking to
undermine targeted governments and influence the outcomes of electoral contests.
The 2020 U.S. elections are currently drawing attention to election cyber risks, but 2020 has
already hosted dozens of elections worldwide, with more to come. In the Asia-Pacific region
these included elections in Taiwan, India, South Korea, and Singapore to name a few, with
regional elections scheduled for Indonesia in December.
Given the prevalence of such activity worldwide and Mandiant's unique visibility into threat
actor activity, we believe it is worthwhile to examine trends in adversary targeting of elections
in a variety of regional contexts because the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
used in one region today may soon be deployed or mimicked in other regions.
Notable Electoral Targeting in Asia-Pacific Region
Mandiant Threat Intelligence tracked numerous elections-related incidents in the Asia-Pacific
region in recent years. During this time, the most prolific regional actor was China, which we
observed in more than 20 elections-related campaigns most frequently affecting Hong Kong
and Taiwan. We believe that China's primary motives for elections targeting includes
monitoring political developments, internal stability, and supporting Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) investments.
Examples of Chinese cyber espionage targeting electoral support organizations include:
Targeting candidates and related staff associated with the November 2019 Hong Kong
District Council elections with a malicious macro document.
Targeting the Australian Parliament in February 2019, three months before the
country's general elections.
Compromising Cambodia's National Election Commission in mid-2018 based on the
use of AIRBREAK malware by APT40, possibly looking to understand the impact of the
election outcome on Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plans. See our blog post for more
details about this campaign.
A spear phishing campaign targeting multiple government agencies in Southeast Asia
in the spring of 2018 to deliver FIREPIT payloads. The nature of the lure material and
targeting indicate the activity was potentially an effort to monitor an upcoming election
in the affected country.
Specifically, Mandiant has observed multiple instances in which organizations such as
electoral boards and commissions that support or help administer elections have been
targeted. Both Russian and Chinese cyber espionage operations have targeted election
administrators and government officials since at least 2014. Observed TTPs include phishing
and strategic website compromise (SWC), also known as watering hole attacks.

For example, in the November 2019 activity targeting Hong Kong (previously referenced),
Mandiant Threat Intelligence believes that candidates or related staff associated with the
Hong Kong District Council elections were targeted with a malicious macro document just
prior to the elections based on geolocation information, the spear-phishing lure, and other
data.

As our readers will know, Mandiant takes a specific approach to deconstructing attacks
against elections, which we detailed in a previous blog post.

Our approach examines threats through the lens of risk posed at various levels of the
elections ecosystem. We break the elections threat landscape into distinct attack surfaces to
better allow our customers and partners to take action. These include the following:
Electoral Platforms Affecting Public Opinion
Electoral Process Support Organizations
Core Electoral Process Systems
Attack surfaces associated with the electoral process

Top Target of Election Cyber Threat Activity: Public Opinion
Using our ecosystem taxonomy, based on activity observed from 2016 to 2019, Mandiant
Threat Intelligence assesses that actors concentrated on "platforms affecting public opinion"
much more often than "core election systems" such as voting machines, or "electoral support

organizations" such as election commissions.
Electoral platforms affecting public opinions are most frequently targeted

Globally, we assess that actors continue to deploy disinformation in the form of fabricated
news and hoaxes spread primarily via social media and counterfeit websites designed to
mimic legitimate news organizations, which may be picked up by legitimate news
organizations. In the last several years, we have seen influence operations use increasingly
creative methods to blend their inauthentic messaging with legitimate speech (e.g., by
interviewing, impersonating, and hiring legitimate journalists or experts, and sending letters
to the editor to real publications).
Malicious actors create and spread disinformation with the intent to mislead an electorate by
causing reputational damage to an individual or political party, or by casting doubt regarding
a particular issue or political process. Influence campaigns also seek to exacerbate existing
societal divisions.

In the Asia-Pacific region, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed pro-China threat actors
spoof Taiwanese media outlet TVBS (官方網站) to promote narratives in line with the
People's Republic of China's (PRC's) political interests in a coordinated, inauthentic
manner. The accounts use a variety of tactics in order to pose as Western media outlets,
including the use of identical or near-identical usernames, display names, and profile photos
as the accounts of the outlets they imitate.

Public exposure of high-profile information operations, such as Russia's interference in the
2016 U.S. presidential election, has strengthened perceptions that such operations are
effective. It also demonstrates the difficulty that open societies face in countering this threat,
encouraging current and aspiring information operation sponsors to grow their efforts. We
anticipate that influence operations conducted in support of the political interests of nationstates will increase in sophistication, volume, and diversity of actors through 2020 and
beyond.
In the last 12 months, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed and reported on information
operations conducted in support of the political interests of numerous countries. During
Singapore's 2020 general elections, the country's first "digital" election, Mandiant Threat

Intelligence identified multiple inauthentic accounts. These accounts did not, however,
appear to be acting in a coordinated manner.
Outlook and Implications
We expect that threat actors will continue to target entities associated with elections
worldwide for the foreseeable future and may expand the scope of this activity as long as the
potential rewards of these operations outweigh the risks. State-sponsored actors almost
certainly view targeting the electoral process as an effective means of projecting power and
collecting intelligence.
Furthermore, the continuous expansion of the social media landscape will likely encourage
various actors to pursue information operations by promoting preferred narratives, including
the use of propagating inauthentic or deceptive information. We have already seen tactics
evolve to avoid detection and incorporate emerging technologies, such as "deepfake" or
multimedia manipulation technology, to advance more believable and impactful information
operations, and we expect these innovations to continue. Lower tech methods, such as
outsourcing propaganda activities to real people hired specifically to spread false and
misleading content, can hinder attribution efforts and potentially increase the effectiveness of
operations if those people have a more specialized understanding of the information
environment.
To battle election threats, there is an urgent need to increase public awareness of the threat
and inculcate behaviors that reduce the risk of compromise or disruption. These include
everything from rigorously securing email to implementing policy around notification of cyber
incidents in the supply chain. In addition, governments can consider mandating digital imprint
requirements for election campaigning, increasing fines for electoral fraud, and increasing
transparency around digital political advertisements. Investment in news verification and
screening methodologies on search and social media platforms as well as public education
efforts equipping voters and students to distinguish trustworthy information from suspicions
may also reduce the impact of influence operations.
