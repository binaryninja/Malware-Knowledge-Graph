Executive Summary
BlueSky ransomware is an emerging family that has adopted modern techniques to evade security
defenses.
Ransomware is a malicious program designed to encrypt a user’s data and demand a ransom for
the decryption. BlueSky ransomware predominantly targets Windows hosts and utilizes
multithreading to encrypt files on the host for faster encryption.
In our analysis, we found code fingerprints from samples of BlueSky ransomware that can be
connected to the Conti ransomware group. In particular, the multithreaded architecture of BlueSky
bears code similarities with Conti v3, and the network search module is an exact replica of it.
1/13

However, in another respect, BlueSky more closely resembles Babuk Ransomware. Both use
ChaCha20, an algorithm for file encryption, along with Curve25519 for key generation.
According to research done by CloudSEK, PowerShell scripting is used to drop and download
BlueSky ransomware from a fake website to encrypt data. After successful encryption, BlueSky
Ransomware renames the encrypted files with the file extension .bluesky and drops a ransom note
file named # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.txt and # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.html.
Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from BlueSky ransomware and other types of
ransomware through Cortex XDR, the Next-Generation Firewall and cloud-delivered security
services including WildFire. The Advanced URL Filtering subscription provides real-time URL
analysis and malware prevention for BlueSky ransomware.

Initial Dropper
As shown in Figure 1, BlueSky ransomware is initially dropped by the PowerShell script start.ps1,
which is hosted at hxxps://kmsauto[.]us/someone/start.ps1. The initial dropper is Base64-encoded
and then DEFLATE-compressed, which is common behavior observed among PowerShell
droppers.

Figure 1. Initial dropper.
After extracting the embedded Base64-encoded stream from start.ps1, the decoded and
uncompressed data stream led to yet another PowerShell script called stage.ps1. This script
contained countless irrelevant comments in an attempt to conceal malicious activity. After removing
these excessive comments, we discovered that start.ps1 downloaded a number of payloads from
hxxps://kmsauto[.]us/someone/ based on the user’s privileges, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Initial dropper (decoded).

Local Privilege Escalation
Before downloading additional payloads to perform local privilege escalation, the PowerShell script,
stage.ps1, determines if it is being executed as a privileged user. If so, it moves to the next step
and downloads and executes the ransomware payload. If not, it uses the following techniques to
escalate local privileges, depending on the version of the host operating system. If the version of
the host operating system is earlier than Windows 10, such as Windows 7, 8 or XP, then the script
will download and execute a modified version of the local privilege escalation tool called
JuicyPotato. If the host is running Windows 10 or later, then the script will download and execute
ghost.exe and spooler.exe to exploit local privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2020-0796 and
CVE-2021-1732 respectively.

Ransomware Payload
After gaining additional privileges, stage.ps1 downloads the final BlueSky ransomware payload
from hxxps://kmsauto[.]us/someone/l.exe and saves it locally to the filesystem as javaw.exe,
attempting to masquerade as a legitimate Windows application. Eventually, the sample executes
from the file path %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\javaw.exe.

Ransom Note
BlueSky drops the ransom note as a text file named # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.txt and an
HTML file named # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.html in a local directory where it has encrypted
files successfully and renamed them with the file extension .bluesky. The content of # DECRYPT
FILES BLUESKY #.html is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. BlueSky ransom note.

Anti-Analysis Techniques
BlueSky implements multiple anti-analysis techniques, including string encryption, API obfuscation
and anti-debugging mechanisms, allowing it to obfuscate Windows API function names and use
indirect calls for resolving APIs. Additionally, BlueSky encodes API names using DJB hashing
functions as shown in Figure 4, hindering malware analysis.

Figure 4. DJB hash matching.

Ransomware Artifacts
BlueSky generates a unique user ID by computing the MD5 hash over the combined Volume
Information, Machine GUID, Product ID and Install Date values, as shown in Figure 5. Furthermore,
it uses the same ID for generating the mutex Global\<32-byte ID>.

6/13

Figure 5. Unique ID calculation.
It creates the registry key HKCU\Software\<32-byte ID> to store registry entries completed,
RECOVERY BLOB and x25519_public to fingerprint its ransomware operations. Once the
encryption process is completed, the registry entry completed is set with a value of 1. RECOVERY
BLOB is a fingerprint identifier for the compromised organization, which is encrypted by the
ChaCha20 encryption algorithm. The structure of the RECOVERY BLOB is shown in Table 1.

File Encryption
Unlike other ransomware, which normally contains a list of file extensions to identify eligible files for
encryption, BlueSky consists of a list of extensions that are negated in the file encryption process.
The file extensions used in BlueSky are listed below:
ldf, scr, icl, 386, cmd, ani, adv, theme, msi, rtp, diagcfg, msstyles, bin, hlp, shs, drv, wpx, bat, rom,
msc, lnk, cab, spl, ps1, msu, ics, key, msp, com, sys, diagpkg, nls, diagcab, ico, lock, ocx, mpa, cur,
cpl, mod, hta, exe, ini, icns, prf, dll, bluesky, nomedia, idx
Directory names excluded from encryption:
$recycle.bin, $windows.~bt, $windows.~ws, boot, windows, windows.old, system volume
information, perflogs, programdata, program files, program files (x86), all users, appdata, tor
browser
Filenames excluded from encryption:
# decrypt files bluesky #.txt, # decrypt files bluesky #.html, ntuser.dat, iconcache.db, ntuser.dat.log,
bootsect.bak, autorun.inf, bootmgr, ntldr, thumbs.db
As shown in Figure 7, BlueSky uses a multithreaded queue for encryption. It starts multiple threads
– one responsible for file encryption, another for enumerating files on the local file system and
mounted network shares to be added into the queue. This multithreaded architecture bears code
similarities with Conti (Ransomware) v3. In particular, the network search module is an exact replica

8/13

of Conti v3. However, there are certain differences in the file encryption routine. For instance, Conti
v3 uses RSA- and AES-based file encryption, whereas BlueSky utilizes Curve25519- and
ChaCha20-based file encryption.

Figure 7. Ransomware queues.
The file encryption of BlueSky is similar to Babuk Ransomware – both use Curve25519 to generate
a public key for the host and generate a shared key with the public key of the attacker. After
generating an elliptic curve key pair, BlueSky computes a hash of the shared key, and uses it to
generate a file encryption key for the ChaCha20 algorithm. Finally, it reads the file buffer, encrypts it
with ChaCha20 and replaces the contents of the original file, as shown in Figure 8.

RedLine Infostealer Association

9/13

All samples we observed related to BlueSky ransomware were hosted at an active domain named
kmsauto[.]us. When hunting for more samples related to BlueSky ransomware, we observed that
several malware samples associated with the RedLine infostealer were hosted on the same
domain. Although we did not find any code overlap between RedLine and BlueSky ransomware,
similarities in the initial stages were observed, as both these families use a PowerShell downloader
as the initial vector.

Conclusion
Ransomware authors are adopting modern advanced techniques such as encoding and encrypting
malicious samples, or using multi-staged ransomware delivery and loading, to evade security
defenses. BlueSky ransomware is capable of encrypting files on victim hosts at rapid speeds with
multithreaded computation. In addition, the ransomware adopts obfuscation techniques, such as
API hashing, to slow down the reverse engineering process for the analyst.
It is very likely that ransomware attacks will continue to grow with advanced encryption techniques
and delivery mechanisms.
Palo Alto Networks customers with Cortex XDR, the Next-Generation Firewall and Advanced URL
Filtering benefit from protections against the attacks discussed in this article. Additionally, the
malicious indicators (domains, URLs and hashes) can be prevented with our DNS Security and
WildFire services.
