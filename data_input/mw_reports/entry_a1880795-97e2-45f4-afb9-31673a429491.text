1.0

INTRODUCTION

By letter dated September 9, 2009 (Reference 1), as supplemented by letters dated November
13, 2009 (Reference 2), and July 11, 2010 (Reference 3), Invensys Operations Management
(IOM) requested U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval for the “Triconex Topical
Report,” IOM Document No. 7286-545-1, Revision 4 (Reference 4), hereafter referred to as the
licensing topical report (LTR). The supplemental documents provided under the cover letter
dated September 22, 2009, and the subsequent cover letters dated from October 30, 2009,
through August 12, 2011, provided additional information that clarified and supported the
technical claims documented in the LTR and did not expand or change the scope of the LTR.
The LTR was accepted for review by letter dated August 11, 2010 (Reference 67). The
acceptance letter identified IOM commitments to supply supplemental documents. These
documents provide additional information to support the review of the design details and
qualification of the Tricon V10 platform and were submitted under the cover letter dated
August 5, 2010, with an enclosure (Reference 59) providing summary responses to NRC
inquiries for clarification within the acceptance letter.
The LTR revision describes the completion of all testing and documentation requirements of
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Technical Report (TR)-107330 for Version 10.5.1
(V10) of the Tricon Triple Modular Redundant (TMR) Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
platform, which is an evolutionary upgrade to the NRC approved Version 9.5.3 (V9),
documented in Triconex Topical Report 7286-545-1-A, “Qualification Summary Report,”
(Reference 34). The current LTR revision includes a summary of the equipment qualification for
the Tricon V10 and a synopsis of the differences between the Tricon V9 System and the Tricon
V10 System.
The NRC staff conducted an audit at the IOM facility in Irvine, California, on December 15 -17,
2010 (Reference 6). The purpose of the audit was to inspect IOM procedures and processes
that are referenced in the LTR and audit documented products of commercial grade dedication
activities. During the site visit, thread audits were performed, the hardware configuration of the
Tricon qualification test specimen was observed, and performance characteristics and functional
capabilities of the platform were observed. The results of the audit are documented in the
March 14, 2011, Audit Report (Reference 6).
The NRC’s approval of the Tricon V9 platform is documented in its safety evaluation report
(SER), “Review of Triconex Corporation Topical Reports 7286-545, “Qualification Summary
Report” and 7286-546, “Amendment 1 to Qualification Summary Report, Revision 1” (TAC NO.
MA8283)” (Reference 9), which formed the basis for the NRC staff’s safety evaluation (SE) of
the Tricon V10 platform. The NRC staff focused its review efforts on the impact of V10 platform
changes on the V9 platform safety conclusions documented in the SE. For those hardware and

–2–
software items that are common to both the V9 and V10 platforms, the NRC’s approval is
documented in the V9 platform SE. However, changes to review guidance since 2001 required
some aspects of the V9 platform to be reevaluated or evaluated in greater detail and the
regulatory findings are documented herein.
2.0

REGULATORY EVALUATION

The purpose of this SE is to evaluate whether the Tricon V10.5.1 platform is suitable for use in
safety-related (SR) applications in nuclear power plants (NPP). Thus, the review of the LTR
and supporting technical documents is intended to determine whether sufficient evidence is
presented to enable a determination with reasonable assurance that subsequent licensing
applications referencing this platform can comply with the applicable regulations to ensure that
the public health and safety will be protected. This evaluation and associated audit activities are
not intended to completely assess all aspects of the design and implementation of any specific
SR application (e.g., reactor protection system or engineered safeguards actuation system) and
full compliance with relevant regulations will need to be evaluated on a plant-specific basis.
However, the review scope is sufficient to allow the reviewer to reach the conclusion of
reasonable assurance within the platform-level context.
2.1

SCOPE OF TRICONEX PLATFORM CHANGES V9.5.3 TO V10.5.1

The Tricon V10 PLC system is designed and built with the same basic architecture as the V9
PLC system. It is a fault-tolerant PLC that uses a triple modular redundant (TMR) architecture
in which three parallel control paths are integrated into a single overall system. The system is
designed to use two-out-of-three voting with the intent of providing uninterrupted process
operation with no single point of random hardware failure.
However, many of the previously approved components within the V9 platform have been
updated or replaced in the V10 platform. The most prominent changes to the Tricon V10
platform are the main processor (MP) module and the communications module. The Tricon
V9.5.3 MP module, 3006N MP is replaced by the 3008N MP in the Tricon V10.5.1. Multiple
communications modules available for V9.5.3 have been replaced with a single module
configuration, the Tricon Communication Module (TCM). The complete list of hardware (HW)
and software (SW) changes implemented within the Tricon V10 platform is provided in Tables 1
and 2 below (Reference 10). The Tricon V9 HW and SW components are also listed for
comparison.
IOM included an Application Guide in Appendix B of the LTR that describes a generic safety
system application using the V10 platform. The Application Guide was provided to facilitate a
better understanding of the platform’s potential safety system applications in NPPs. However,
the NRC staff did not make any safety determination regarding the Application Guide and this
appendix is not approved by this SE.
In addition to the V10 platform changes, IOM also submitted the Nuclear Safety Integration
Program Manual (NSIPM) and an SE Maintenance Plan as part of the LTR. The NSIPM
governs application specific development activities that occur at IOM’s facility. The SE
Maintenance Plan describes IOM’s process to evaluate and document any future changes to
the approved platform. The NRC staff reviewed these documents, but made no safety
determinations on these programs and, therefore, they are not approved by this SE. It is an
application-specific action item (ASAI) to review any application specific development activities
governed by the NSIPM.

REGULATORY CRITERIA

The acceptance criteria used as the basis for this review are defined in NUREG-0800,
“Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants,”
Revision 5, dated March 2007. NUREG-0800, which is referred to as the Standard Review Plan
(SRP), sets forth a method for reviewing compliance with applicable sections of Title 10 Part 50
of the Code of Federal Regulations ( 10 CFR), “Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization
Facilities.” Specifically, SRP Chapter 7, “Instrumentation and Controls,” addresses the

–6–
requirements for instrumentation and control (I&C) systems in nuclear power plants based on
light-water reactor designs. The procedures for review of digital systems applied in this
evaluation are principally contained within SRP Chapter 7 and are augmented and
supplemented by Interim Staff Guidance (ISG).
The suitability of a digital platform for use in safety systems depends on the quality of its
components; quality of the design process; and system implementation aspects such as
real-time performance, independence, and online testing. Because this equipment is intended
for use in safety systems and other SR applications, the submitted LTR was evaluated in
accordance with the provisions of IEEE Std 603-1991, “IEEE Standard Criteria for Safety
Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” and IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003, “IEEE Standard
Criteria for Digital Computers in Safety Systems of Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” based
on the guidance contained in SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, “Guidance for Evaluation of
Conformance to IEEE Std 603,” and Appendix 7.1-D, “Guidance for Evaluation of the
Application of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2,” which provide acceptance criteria for these two standards.
SRP Chapter 7, Table 7-1, “Regulatory Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, and Guidelines for
Instrumentation and Control Systems Important to Safety,” identifies design criteria and
regulations from 10 CFR Part 50 that are applicable to I&C systems and are relevant for general
review of the suitability of a digital I&C (DI&C) platform for generic SR applications. Many of the
review criteria of the SRP depend on the design of an assembled system for a particular
application, whereas the LTR presents the elements of hardware and system software in the
Tricon V10 platform that can be used in a variety of safety applications. Since no plant-specific
application of the platform as a safety system is associated with the LTR, this SE is limited to
the evaluation of compliance with the relevant regulations and guidance documents to the
degree to which they can be satisfied at the platform level. In effect, fulfillment of system-level
requirements can only be partially evaluated on a generic basis based on the capabilities and
characteristics of the Tricon V10 platform.
Determination of full compliance with the applicable regulations remains subject to plant specific
licensing review of a full system design based on the Tricon V10 platform. Thus, it is an ASAI to
establish full compliance with the design criteria and regulations identified in SRP Chapter 7,
Table 7-1, which are relevant to specific applications of DI&C systems at the time the
application is submitted to NRC for approval. This and other ASAIs identified in the evaluation
documented in Section 3 are compiled in Section 4.2 of this report.
The following regulations and design criteria in 10 CFR Part 50 are applicable in whole or in part
for general review of the suitability of this I&C platform for generic SR applications at NPPs:
•

•

10 CFR 50.55a(a)(1), “Quality Standards for Systems Important to Safety,” requires that
“structures, systems, and components must be designed, fabricated, erected,
constructed, tested, and inspected to quality standards commensurate with the
importance of the safety function to be performed”
10 CFR 50.55a(h), “Protection and safety systems,” incorporates by reference the 1991
version of IEEE Std 603, “IEEE Standard Criteria for Safety Systems for Nuclear Power
Generating Stations,” including the correction sheet dated January 30, 1995
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A, “General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants”
• General Design Criterion (GDC) 1, “Quality Standards and Records”

SRP Chapter 7, Table 7-1, identifies regulatory guides (RGs), branch technical positions
(BTPs), and industry standards that contain information, recommendations, and guidance and,
in general, provide an acceptable basis to implement the above requirements for both hardware
and software features of SR DI&C systems. Based on the scope of the Tricon V10 platform and
the limitations of a platform-level review, the following guides and positions are determined to
have relevance for consideration in this SE:

The Tricon V10 is an upgrade product based on previous designs. Some design elements of
the Tricon V10 pre-date IOM’s 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix B process and therefore certain
industry guidelines that address dedication and qualification processes are applicable. The
NRC staff has reviewed and accepted the following industry guidance documents based on
conditions established in SE reports.

•
•

EPRI TR-102323, “Guidelines for Electromagnetic Interference Testing in Power Plants,”
as accepted by the NRC SE dated April 30, 1996
EPRI TR-106439, “Guideline on Evaluation and Acceptance of Commercial Grade
Digital Equipment for Nuclear Safety Applications,” as accepted by the NRC SE dated
April 1997
EPRI TR-107330, “Generic Requirements Specification for Qualifying a Commercially
Available PLC for Safety-Related Applications in Nuclear Power Plants,” as accepted by
the NRC SE dated July 30, 1998

It should be noted that industry standards, documents, and reports use the word “requirements”
to denote provisions that must be implemented to ensure compliance with the corresponding
document. Additionally, these standards, documents, and reports provide guidance or
recommendations that need not be adopted by the user to ensure compliance with the
corresponding document, and the optional items are not designated as “requirements.” The
word “requirement” is used throughout the instrumentation and control discipline. However,
licensee or vendor documentation of conformance to the “requirements” provided in industry
standards, documents, and reports referenced in this SE constitutes conformance with NRC
regulatory requirements only insofar as the standards, documents and reports are endorsed by
the NRC. Other use of the word “requirements” in these documents does not indicate that the
“requirements” are NRC regulatory requirements.

PRECEDENTS

Four topical reports for digital platforms have previously been approved by the NRC. These
platforms are the HFC-6000, AREVA TELEPERM XS (TXS), the Westinghouse Common Q,
and the Invensys Triconex, and they were generically qualified in accordance with the approved
guidance of EPRI TR-107330. The corresponding SE reports (References 11, 12, 13, and 9
respectively) for these platforms document the findings of the reviews by NRC staff and
constitute applicable precedents that are considered in the conduct of this review.
Specific precedents employed to support this review address environmental qualification,
exceptions to key performance requirements specified by EPRI TR-107330, and Commercial
Grade Dedication (CGD) of previously developed software (PDS). Each of the SEs for the
generic platforms (i.e., TXS, Common Q, and Tricon V9) addresses deficiencies in the
environmental qualification program for the respective platforms either through treatment as
generic open items or identification of a commitment to retest on a plant-specific basis. The SE
for the Tricon V9 platform (Reference 9) provides a precedent for the treatment of exceptions to
the response time performance requirement from EPRI TR-107330. The SE for the Common Q
platform (Reference 13) provides an evaluation of dedication activities by Combustion
Engineering Nuclear Power (now owned by Westinghouse) for commercial grade items,
including software, which is used in the platform. The commercial dedication of a
Siemens-designed application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for use as the system support
controller on platform printed circuit boards (PCBs) provides a precedent from the SE for the
TXS platform (Reference 12) regarding the treatment of custom chips that provide processor
support functionality for board management.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION

This SE follows the guidance contained in SRP Chapter 7. Chapter 7 of the NRC SRP provides
guidance on reviewing complete NPP designs of I&C systems. Revision 5 to SRP Chapter 7
also includes review criteria for digital systems. The guidance is applicable to the review of TRs
for evaluating the suitability of generic digital platforms for SR use through consideration of
general system requirements. Based on examination of SRP Chapter 7, Table 7-1,
Appendix 7.0-A, “Review Process for Digital Instrumentation and Control Systems,” and
Appendix 7.1-A, “Acceptance Criteria and Guidelines for Instrumentation and Control Systems
Important to Safety,” the relevant regulatory requirements, BTPs, ISG, and acceptance criteria
that can be addressed in part at the platform level are identified in Section 2.2 of this SE. The
evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against the identified acceptance criteria is documented in
the following subsections.
IOM designed and built the Tricon PLC system as a commercial grade system, rather than
specifically for use in SR systems in NPPs. As a result, the design process was not governed
by 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix B and the related process documentation may not be fully
consistent with BTP HICB-14. EPRI TR-106439 and TR-107330 recognize that commercial
design practices differ from nuclear specific design practices and discuss how the essential
technical characteristics of products meet the requirements, intent, and quality characteristics
needed for SR systems in NPPs.
The evaluation described in this section is based on review of the information contained within
the LTR. The Tricon V10 platform is described in Section 2.1 of the LTR. Sections 2.2 and 2.3
describe the product qualification. Section 5 of the LTR contains discussion of key safety
system design topics, such as security, diversity, and communications. The material contained
in these sections of the LTR was the principal focus of the SE and is the primary source of the

– 10 –
descriptive information on the Tricon V10 platform presented in this section. Supplemental
documentation docketed by IOM provides supporting and/or clarifying information that was
considered in this evaluation. Specific reference to the source documentation is given where
key information or supporting evidence from any of these additional documents proved to be
essential to the conduct of the evaluation.

TRICON V10 PLATFORM DESCRIPTION

This section provides an overview of the Tricon V10 system. A detailed description of the
system is provided in the following IOM documents; “Technical Product Guide, Tricon systems”
(Reference 15), and the “Planning and Installation Guide” (Reference 16). The specific
hardware and software that has been qualified is identified in the “Master Configuration List”
(Reference 17). Table 3-1 in Section 3.3 of this document lists the Tricon V10 modules that
have been qualified for nuclear SR applications.
3.1.1

TRICON V10 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

A typical Tricon V10 system (for example, one division of a reactor protection system) would
consist of one or more 19-inch rack or panel mounted chassis. Each Tricon V10 system
includes a main chassis, illustrated in Figure 2-1, and may also include additional expansion
chassis.

Figure 2-1 – Tricon V10 Main Chassis
Each chassis is powered by two independent, redundant power supplies, each capable of
providing the full power requirements of the chassis. Thus, the system can withstand a power
supply failure without interruption.
The Tricon V10 is triple redundant from input terminal to output terminal, as shown in
Figure 2-2. The triple modular redundant (TMR) architecture is intended to allow continued
system operation in the presence of any single point of failure within the system. The TMR
architecture is also intended to allow the Tricon V10 to detect and correct individual faults online, without interruption of monitoring, control, and protection capabilities. In the presence of a

– 11 –
fault, the Tricon V10 will alarm the condition, remove the affected portion of the faulted module
from operation, and continue to function normally in a dual redundant mode. The system
returns to the fully triple redundant mode of operation when the affected module is replaced.
To facilitate module replacement, the Tricon V10 chassis includes provisions for a spare
module, logically paired with a single input or output module. This design allows on-line, hot
replacement of any module, under power while the system is running, with no impact on the
operation of the application.

Figure 2-2 – Triple Modular Redundant Architecture
Figure 2-2 shows the arrangement of the input, MP, and output modules. As shown, each input
and output module includes three separate and independent input or output circuits or legs.
These legs communicate independently with the three main processor modules. Standard
firmware is resident on the MP modules for all three microprocessors as well as on the input
and output modules and communication modules (not shown in Figure 2-2).
3.1.2

TRICON V10 SYSTEM HARDWARE

The main components of a Tricon V10 system are the chassis, the termination panels, the
power supply modules, the main processor, I/O modules, and communication modules.
Functional requirements for this hardware are specified in Section 4.3 of EPRI TR-107330.
Compliance of the Tricon V10 hardware with these requirements is summarized in the
Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), Appendix A of the LTR. A description of this hardware
is provided below.
3.1.2.1

8110N2 MAIN CHASSIS

A Tricon V10 system consists of one main chassis (shown in Figure 2-1) and up to fourteen
additional expansion chassis. The Tricon V10 main chassis supports the following modules:
•
•
•
•

Two redundant power supply modules
Three main processors
Communications modules
I/O modules

– 12 –
The main chassis also has a key switch that sets the system operating mode:
•
•
•
•

RUN – Normal operation with read-only capability by externally connected systems,
including TriStation. Normally, the switch is set to this position and the key is removed
and stored in a secure location.
PROGRAM – Allows for control of the Tricon V10 system using an externally connected
personal computer (PC) running the TriStation software, including application program
downloads.
STOP – Stops application program execution.
REMOTE – Allows writes to application program variables by a TriStation PC or by
MODBUS masters and external hosts.

As shown in Figure 2-3, the Tricon V10 backplane is designed with dual independent power
rails. Both power rails feed each of the three legs on each I/O module and each main processor
module residing within the chassis. Power to each of the three legs is independently provided
through dual voltage regulators on each module. Each power rail is fed from one of the two
power supply modules residing in the chassis. Under normal circumstances, each of the three
legs on each I/O module and each main processor module draw power from both power
supplies through the dual power rails and the dual power regulators. If one of the power
supplies or its supporting power line fails, the other power supply will increase its power output
to support the requirements of all modules in the chassis.
The Tricon V10 also has dual redundant batteries located on the main chassis backplane. If a
total power failure occurs, these batteries maintain data and programs on the main processor
modules for a period of six months. The system will generate an alarm when the battery power
is too low to support the system.
The 8110N main chassis approved for the Tricon V9 is functionally equivalent to the 8110N2
qualified with the Tricon V10. However, they are not interchangeable.
3.1.2.2

8111N EXPANSION CHASSIS

The expansion chassis is the same as approved for V9 and is used locally to increase the
number of I/O modules in the Tricon V10 PLC system. The expansion chassis are
interconnected via three separate RS-485 data links, one for each leg of the three I/O legs. If
communication modules are installed, three separate RS-485 data links are required for the
three communications busses. The Tricon expansion chassis can support the following
modules:
•
•
•

Two redundant power supply modules
Communications modules (in the first expansion chassis only)
I/O modules

– 13 –

Figure 2-3 – Tricon V10 Chassis Backplane Configuration
3.1.2.3

8112N REMOTE EXPANSION CHASSIS

The remote expansion chassis are similar to the expansion chassis, but are used for remote
locations, rather than locally. As such, each remote expansion chassis has remote extender
modules (RXMs) that serve as repeaters or extenders of the Tricon V10 I/O bus to allow
communications with the main chassis and expansion chassis within a channel or a division. A
single remote RXM chassis or module would not be configured to communicate with more than
one channel/division.
The Tricon V10 remote extender chassis uses the same type of power supplies as the main
chassis, and has the same dual and redundant power bus arrangement. The 8112N remote
expansion chassis was approved with the Tricon V9 and is unchanged as qualified with the
Tricon V10.
3.1.2.4

4200N PRIMARY & 4201N REMOTE EXTENDER MODULES

RXMs are multi-mode fiber optic modules that allow expansion chassis to be located up to 1.2
miles away from the main chassis. An RXM connection consists of three identical modules,
serving as repeaters/extenders of the Tricon I/O bus that also provide ground loop isolation.

– 14 –
Each RXM has single channel transmit and receive cabling ports. Each of the three 4200N
Primary RXMs is connected to the 4201N remote RXMs housed in the remote chassis. Each
pair of RXMs is connected with two fiber optic cables operating at a communication rate of 375
Kbaud. The interfacing cabling is unidirectional for each channel. One cable carries data
transmitted from the primary RXM to the remote RXM. The second cable carries data received
by the primary RXM from the remote RXM. The RXMs provide immunity against electrostatic
and electromagnetic interference. The fiber optic cables provide Class 1E to Non-Class 1E
isolation between a SR main chassis and a non-safety-related (NSR) expansion chassis.
The Tricon V9 was qualified with the 4210N and 4211N primary and remote RXM set which
used single mode fiber optic cable. The V10 was qualified with the 4200N Primary and 4201N
remote RXM set which uses multimode fiber optic cable. Both use the same software (see
Table 2 above) and differ in the type of fiber optic cable that is supported. The V10 supported
multimode fiber optic cable is capable of a 1.2 mile span while the V9 supported single mode
version is capable of a 7.5 mile span. Though both RXM sets have been qualified, they are not
interchangeable across the platforms because they were not qualified as interchangeable.
3.1.2.5

EXTERNAL TERMINATION ASSEMBLIES

The external termination assemblies (ETAs) are printed circuit board panels used for landing
field wiring. The panels contain terminal blocks, resistors, fuses, and blown fuse indicators.
The standard panels are configured for specific applications (e.g., digital input, AI, etc.). The
thermocouple input termination panel provides cold-junction temperature sensors and upscale,
downscale, or programmable burnout detection. The resistance temperature device (RTD)
termination panels include signal conditioning modules. Each termination panel includes an
interface cable that connects the termination panel to the Tricon V10 chassis backplane. The
following ETAs were qualified with the Tricon V10 platform: 9794-110N PI, 9782-110N AI,
9561-810N DI, 9561-110N DI, 9664-810N DO, 9663-610N DO, 9563-810N DI, 9662-810N DO,
9662-610N DO, 9668-110N RO, 9667-810NDO, 9562-810N DI, 9795-610N AI, 9790-610N AI,
9860-610N AO, 9764-310N AI, and 9783-110N AI.
3.1.2.6

8310N2, 8311N2, AND 8312N2 POWER SUPPLY MODULES

All power supply modules are rated for 175 watts, which is sufficient to supply the power
requirements of all configurations expected in SR applications. Two different power supply
modules can be used in a single chassis. Three models are available to support different power
sources: 120 VAC/DC (alternating or direct current), 230 VAC, and 24 VDC.
The power supply modules possess built in diagnostic circuitry to check for out-of-range
voltages and/or over temperature conditions. Indicator light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the front
face of each power module provide module status as follows:

– 15 –
The power supply modules also contain the system alarm contacts. The chassis backplane
provides terminal strip interfaces for power and alarm connections. The alarm feature operates
independently for each power module.
On the main chassis, the alarm contacts on both power supply modules actuate on the following
states:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

System configuration does not match the control-program configuration
A digital output module experiences a Load / Fuse error
An AO module experiences a Load error
A configured module is missing somewhere in the system
A module is inserted in an unconfigured slot
A fault is detected on a Main Processor or I/O module in the main chassis
A fault is detected on an I/O module in an expansion chassis
A main processor detects a system fault
The inter-chassis I/O bus cables are incorrectly installed (i.e., cross connected)

The alarm contacts on at least one of the chassis power supplies will actuate when the following
power conditions exist:
•
•
•

A power module fails
Primary power to a power module is lost
A power module has a low battery or over temperature condition

The alarm contacts on both power modules of an expansion chassis actuate when a fault is
detected on an I/O module.
3.1.2.7

3008N MAIN PROCESSOR MODULES

The Tricon V10 main processor subsystem utilizes three 3008N MP modules to control the
three separate legs of the system. Each 3008N MP module operates independently with no
shared clocks, power regulators, or circuitry. Each 3008N MP module controls one of the three
signal processing legs in the system and each contains two 32-bit processors. One of the 32-bit
processors is a dedicated, leg-specific I/O and communication (IOCCOM) microprocessor that
processes all communication with the system I/O modules and communication modules.
The second 32-bit primary processor manages execution of the safety control program and all
system diagnostics at the main processor module level. Between the two 32-bit primary
processors is a dedicated dual port random access memory (RAM) allowing for direct memory
access data exchanges.
The operating system (ETSX 6271), run-time library, and fault analysis for the main processor is
fully contained in flash memory on each 3008N MP module. As shown in Figure 3-2, the Tricon
V10 PLC system has four separate bus structures, the Tribus, the communications bus, the I/O
bus, and the bus internal to each of the main processor modules. Each of these bus structures
is triplicated. The main processors communicate with one another through a proprietary, high
speed, voting, bi-directional serial channel called TriBUS. Each main processor has an I/O
channel for communicating with one of the three legs of each I/O module. All external data
coming into the main processor comes through the dual port RAM and does not require
handshaking or use of interrupts. Each main processor has an independent clock circuit and
selection mechanism that enables all three main processors to coordinate their operations each
scan to allow voting of data and exchange of diagnostic information.

Figure 3-2 Tricon Communication Busses

Figure 3-2 – Tricon Bus Diagram
The IOCCOM (IOCCOM 6054) processors constantly poll respective legs for all the I/O modules
in the system. They continually update an input data table in dual port RAM on the main
processor module with data downloaded from the leg-specific input data tables from each input
module. Communication of data between the main processor modules and the I/O modules is
accomplished over the triplicated I/O data bus using a master-slave communication protocol.
The system uses cyclic redundancy checks (CRC) to ensure the correctness of data transmitted
between modules. Should a main processor module lose communication with its respective leg
on any of the input modules in the system, or the CRC reveals that the data has been corrupted,
the system will retry the data transmission up to three times. If unsuccessful, input tables at the
main processor module level are constructed with data in the de-energized state. Errors such
as an open circuited data bus, short circuited data bus, or data corrupted while in transit will
force the input table entries to the de-energized state.
At the beginning of each scan, each primary processor takes a snapshot of the input data table
in dual port RAM, and transmits the snap shots to the other main processor modules over the
TriBUS. This transfer is synchronized using the TriClock. Each module independently forms a
voted input table based on respective input data points across the three snapshot data tables. If
a main processor module receives corrupted data or loses communication with one of the other
3008N MP modules, the local table representing that respective leg data will default to the
de-energized state. If a disagreement occurs, the value found in two out of three tables prevails
and the third is corrected accordingly. One-time differences that result from sample timing
variations are distinguished from a pattern of differing data. Each main processor maintains
data about the necessary corrections in local memory. Any disparity is flagged and used at the
end of the scan by the built-in fault analyzer routines of the Tricon V10 PLC system to determine

– 17 –
whether a fault exists in a particular module. This feature is essential to maintaining
deterministic behavior in the triple modular redundant architecture.
For digital inputs, the voted input table is formed by a two out of three majority vote on
respective inputs across the three data tables. The voting scheme is designed for de-energize
to trip applications, always defaulting to the de-energized state unless voted otherwise. Any
single leg failure or corrupted signal feeding a main processor module is corrected or
compensated for at the main processor module level when the voted data table is formed.
For AIs, a mid-value selection algorithm chooses an AI signal representation in the voted input
table. The algorithm selects the median of the three signal values representing a particular
input point for representation in the voted input tables. Any single leg failure or corrupted signal
feeding a main processor module is compensated for at the main processor module level when
the voted data table is formed. Errors are alarmed.
The primary processors then execute the application safety program in parallel on the voted
input table data and produce an output table of values in dual port RAM. The voting schemes
explained above for analog and digital input data ensure the process control programs are
executed on the same input data value representations. The IOCCOM processors generate
smaller output tables, each corresponding to an individual output module in the system. Each
small table is transmitted to the appropriate leg of the corresponding output module over the I/O
data bus.
The transmission of data between the main processor modules and the output modules is
performed over the I/O data bus using a master-slave communication protocol. The system
uses CRC to ensure the data transmitted between modules is not corrupted. If the CRC reveals
that the data has been corrupted, the system will retry the data transmission up to three times.
If unsuccessful, that respective leg data table at the output module level will default to the deenergized state. Watchdog timers on each output module leg ensure communication has been
maintained with its respective main processor module. If communication has not been
established or has been lost, the respective leg data table will default to the de-energized state
to protect against open or short-circuited data bus connections between modules.
The main processor diagnostics monitor the proper operation of each main processor as well as
each I/O module and communication channel. The main processor modules process diagnostic
data recorded locally and data received from the input module level diagnostics in order to make
decisions about the health of the input modules in the system. All discrepancies are flagged
and used by the built in fault analyzer routine to diagnose faults. The main processor
diagnostics perform the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Verification of fixed-program memory.
Verification of the static portion of RAM.
Verification of the dual port RAM interface with each IOCCOM.
Checking of each IOCCOM’s ROM, dual port RAM access and loopback of RS-485
transceivers.
Verification of the TriTime interface.
Verification of the TriBUS interface.

When a fault is detected on a 3008N MP module, it is annunciated and voted out, and
processing continues through the remaining two 3008N MP modules. When the faulty main
processor module is replaced, it runs a self-diagnostic to verify its proper operation. When the

– 18 –
self-diagnostic is successfully completed, the main processor module then begins the process
of “re-education,” where the control program is transferred from each of the working units into
the returning main processor module. All three 3008N MP modules then resynchronize data
and voting, and the replacement processor module is allowed back in service.
3.1.2.8

INPUT/OUTPUT MODULES

As shown in Figure 2-2, all TMR input modules contain three separate, independent processing
systems, referred to as legs, for signal processing (Input Legs A, B, and C). The legs receive
signals from common field input termination points. The microprocessor in each leg continually
polls the input points, and constantly updates a private input data table in each leg’s local
memory. Signal conditioning, isolation, or processing required for each leg is also performed
independently. The input modules possess sufficient leg-to-leg isolation and independence so
that a component failure in one leg will not affect the signal processing in the other two legs.
Input data is sampled continuously, in some modules compared and/or voted, and sent to the
3008N MP modules. Each main processor module communicates via an individual I/O bus with
one of the triplicated microprocessors on each I/O module. In each main processor module, the
IOCCOM microprocessor reads the data and provides it to the application processor through a
dual port RAM interface. For AIs, the three values of each point are compared, and the middle
value is selected. The control algorithm is invoked only on known good data.
All input modules include self-diagnostic features designed to detect single failures within the
module. Fault detection capabilities built into various types of input modules include the
following:
•
•
•
•

The input data from the three legs is compared at the main processor module, and
persistent differences generate a diagnostic alarm.
Digital input modules test for a stuck on condition by momentarily driving the input for
one leg low in order to verify proper operation of the signal conditioning circuitry. A
diagnostic alarm is generated if the input module does not respond appropriately.
Analog input modules include high accuracy reference voltage sources which are used
to continuously self-calibrate the analog-to-digital converters. If a converter is found to
be out of tolerance, a diagnostic alarm is generated.
Several input modules also include diagnostics to detect field device failures.

A detailed description of each type of input module, including fault detection and data validation
processes, is provided in Section 5 of “System Safety Concept,” IOM Document
No. 9100112-001 (Reference 33).
After the application processor in each 3008N MP module completes the control algorithm, data
is sent out to the output modules. Outputs from the 3008N MP modules are provided to the
IOCCOM microprocessors through dual port RAM. The IOCCOM microprocessors then transfer
that data to the triplicated microprocessors on the output modules. The output modules then set
the output hardware appropriately on each of the triplicated sections and vote on the
appropriate state and/or verify correct operation. Discrete outputs use a unique, patented,
power output voter circuit. This voter circuitry is based on parallel-series paths that pass power
if the driver for legs A and B, or legs B and C, or legs A and C command them to close
(i.e., 2-out-of-3 vote). AOs use a switching arrangement tying the three legs of digital to analog
converters to a single point.

– 19 –
All output modules include self-diagnostic features designed to detect single failures within the
module. The major fault detection capabilities built into output modules include the following:
•
•
•

Digital output modules include output voter diagnostics that toggle the state of one leg at
a time to verify that the output switches are not stuck on or off.
Supervised digital output modules include a voltage and current loopback circuit that
checks for open circuits (i.e., blown fuse) and short circuits in the field wiring.
AO modules include a voltage and current loopback circuit. On these modules, one of
the three legs drives the field load, and the other two legs monitor the loopback current
to verify the module output current is correct.

A detailed description of the output modules, the voting processes, and fault detection
processes is provided in the Planning and Installation Guide (Reference 16).
If one of the three legs within an I/O module fails to function, an alarm is raised by the 3008N
MP modules on the main chassis power modules. If a standby module is installed in the paired
slot with the faulty module, and that module is deemed healthy by the 3008N MP modules, the
system automatically switches over to the standby unit and takes the faulty module off line. If
no standby unit is in place, the faulty module continues to operate on two of the three legs and
protection and control is unaffected. The user obtains a replacement unit and plugs it into the
system into the logically paired slot associated with the failed module. When the 3008N MP
modules detect the presence of a replacement module, they initiate local health state
diagnostics and, if the module is healthy, automatically switch over to the new module. The
faulty module may then be removed and returned to the factory for repair.
If a standby module is installed and both it and its pair are deemed healthy by the 3008N MP
modules, each of the modules is exercised on a periodic basis. The 3008N MP modules will
swap control between the two modules. By periodically using both modules, any faults are
detected, alarmed, and the failed module replaced while a standby module is in place. This use
of standby modules does not cause any interruption of protection or control functions.
The Tricon V9 safety evaluation stated that all Tricon I/O modules have a common core.
However, two of the new modules for V10, 3721N Analog Input and 3625N Digital Output have
a new common core called “Next Generation” (NG). The NG common core is based on the
common core staff reviewed and approved with V9. The NG common core based modules may
be used interchangeably with older design common core cards such that NG cards can be
configured in any chassis configuration and co-located with V9 based cards without special
exception or modification as qualified.
The NG common core has equivalent levels of fault detection as were approved for V9 I/O
modules. Card level scan times for the NG core input modules are 10 milliseconds (msec) as
opposed to the 50 msec times typical for cards approved on the V9 platform. Security is similar
to V9 cores. Firmware (FW) for NG cores cannot be downloaded from the main processor and
no access points are available when the card is installed in the chassis. The NG cards must be
removed from the chassis, which the system will alarm, in order to change the FW. The NG
modules installed in the wrong slot or with FW loads that do not match that programmed in the
application processor will be ignored, which is the same as was previously approved.

state. In addition to the Pass/Fault/Active indicator lights, this module has indicator
lights showing if each of the 32 input points is on or off. The 3502EN2 is a surface
mount version of the 3502EN approved for use on the Tricon V9 platform. The software
has minor updates and was qualified with the Tricon V10 platform.
Model 3503EN2 (EDI 5909) is a 24 VAC/DC digital input module with 32 inputs. Four
groups of 8 inputs use a common reference point. Like the Model 3502EN2, this model

nuclear power plants for the Tricon V10 platform. The 3636TN has 32 normally open
non-common simplex outputs. The Model 3636TN relay output module receives output
signals from the main processors on each of the three legs. The three sets of signals

– 22 –
are then voted, and the voted data is used to drive the 32 individual relays. Each output
has a loopback circuit that verifies the operation of each relay switch, independent of the
presence of a load. Ongoing diagnostics test the operational status of the relay output
module. In addition to the Pass/Fault/Active indicator lights, this module has indicator
lights showing if each of the 32 output points is on or off. Model 3636TN was approved
for use with the Tricon V9 platform and requalified with functionally equivalent software
with the Tricon V10 platform.
3.1.2.9

4352AN TRICON COMMUNICATION MODULE

Like the I/O modules, the TCM has three separate communication busses and three separate
communication bus interfaces, one for each of the three 3008N MP modules. Unlike the I/O
modules, however, the three communication bus interfaces are merged into a single
microprocessor. That microprocessor votes on the communications messages from the three
3008N MP modules and transfers only one of them to an attached device or external system. If
two-way communications are enabled, messages received from the attached device are
triplicated and provided to the three 3008N MP modules.
The communication paths to external systems have CRCs, handshaking, and other
protocol-based features. These features are supported in hardware and FW. FW provides core
functionality common to all the communication modules with additional coding to support the
specific communication protocol.
The three communications modules of the V9 system have been replaced by one
communication module, the 4352AN TCM Fiber Optic module. The TCM allows the Tricon V10
to communicate with other Tricon platforms and with external hosts over fiber optic networks.
The TCM provides two fiber optic port connectors which support peer-to-peer, time
synchronization, and open networking to external systems. In addition, the TCM contains four
serial ports allowing the Tricon V10 to communicate with Modbus master and slaves. Each
serial port is uniquely addressed and supports the Modbus protocol.
The TCM provides functional isolation by handling all the communications with external devices.
In addition, the TCM has been qualified for SR applications and contributes to the overall
reliability of the communication link through the use of IP address discrimination and CRCs, and
testing has demonstrated that it will protect the safety core from network storms and other
communication failures as detailed in IOM Document NTX-SER-10-14, “Tricon V10
Conformance to RG 1.152,” Appendix A (Reference 35). This testing was performed by an
independent third-party (Wurldtech) to validate the robustness of the Tricon V10 platform
against communication failures. Wurldtech performed testing of a number of scenarios testing
the communications link in the presence of a communications failure. This testing is further
discussed in Section 3.8.1.2 of this SE. This report and the data it contains is proprietary;
however, in summary, this testing verified the effectiveness of the TCM to cope with various
communication failures, demonstrating proper handling of rogue and invalid protocol packets,
and continued operation under network storm conditions without adverse impact on the TMR
3008N MP control algorithm. The test configuration included monitoring of digital output signals
to confirm that the Tricon application program running on the TMR 3008N MPs was
unperturbed. This testing validated that the TCM will discard rogue, invalid, and excessive
Ethernet packets (such as during data storms), thereby ensuring the operation of the TMR
3008N MPs was unperturbed during communication failures. The results of the Wurldtech
testing validated the added reliability the TCM provides to the communication link. The third
party vendor, Wurldtech, and associated certification are not endorsed by NRC and are not
approved in this SE. However, the NRC staff credits the testing as a limited demonstration of

– 23 –
the TCM’s ability to protect the safety function. Upon total loss of all TCMs, the safety function
will continue to operate without interruption.
IOM developed a communication application safety layer for communication between an
external processor and the Tricon V10 system. This is an additional layer of protection provided
by the communication protocols at the application layer of the network stack. The Peer-to-Peer
(P2P) and Safety Application Protocol (SAP) protocols ensure end-to-end integrity of
safety-critical messages. System architectures requiring data transfer between SR Tricons over
a network would use the P2P protocol over an isolated, point-to-point network. Architectures
requiring safety-critical data exchange with video display units would utilize the SAP which is
reviewed in Section 3.7.1 of this SE. Tricon V10 conformance to ISG 4 is evaluated in
Section 3.7.3 of this SE.
3.1.3

TRICON V10 SYSTEM SOFTWARE

The Tricon V10 system software consists of the operating system that is resident on the various
microprocessors within the system, the non-safety TriStation 1131 software used to develop
application programs, and the application program itself. Functional requirements for this
software are specified in Section 4.4 of EPRI TR-107330. Compliance of the Tricon V10
software with these requirements is summarized in the Requirements Traceability Compliance
Matrix, Appendix A of the LTR (Reference 4). The following subsections describe each of these
software types in greater detail.
3.1.3.1

TRICON V10 OPERATING SYSTEM: ETSX 6271

The Tricon V10 operating system software consists of the firmware that resides on the
microprocessors in the 3008N MP, I/O, and communication modules. Two sets of dedicated
function microprocessor firmware exist within the 3008N MP module. The application processor
in the 3008N MP is the primary 32-bit microprocessor and has the operating environment
firmware. The IOCCOM microprocessor (the I/O and communication interfaces) has its own FW
to communicate with the I/O and communication modules. The primary microprocessor FW
includes all the built-in self-diagnostics and triple modular redundancy functions; no additional
diagnostic functions need to be developed by the user in the application program.
The operating system (ETSX version 6271) consists of three tasks: Scan Task, Communication
Task, and Background Task. The prioritizations, subtasks, and relationship to the
communications processor (IOCCOM) and its functions are described below and depicted in
Figures 2-4 through 2-6.
Upon power up (when a 3008N MP Module is inserted in the appropriate slot of the main
chassis), the 3008N MP goes through the power up initialization and diagnostics. The power up
sequence includes a series of power up diagnostics – Microprocessor tests, RAM tests, Flash
memory tests, Watchdog test, Clock Calendar test, etc. The power up sequence is also initiated
by hardware and software reset of the 3008N MP. Upon successful completion of Power up
sequence, the 3008N MP enters the Scan Task. Figure 2-4 shows the ETSX version 6271
tasks and priorities.

– 24 –

The scan is divided between these tasks as illustrated in Figure 2-5.

– 25 –
The Scan Task performs the following steps:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Get Inputs from IOCCOM Memory
Perform TriBUS Transfer
Process any synchronization requests
Run Control Program
Send Outputs
Coordinate End of Scan

The Communication Task runs every 10 msec or when a communication port interrupt occurs.
The Communication Task does the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.

Process Messages from IOCCOM
Process Messages from Communication Modules
Fill TriBUS Communication Buffers
Check Event Buffers
Send Diagnostic Messages across secondary channel
Perform Transport Task
Do any loader background work (TriStation messages for download)
Handle any TriBUS Messages from other MPs

The Background Task is responsible to run diagnostics, handle debug port commands, and
write information to flash memory. ETSX Version 6271 is synchronized with the IOCCOM
processor at the beginning of every scan. This is illustrated in Figure 2-6.

The system FW resident on the I/O modules is designed around a common core which supports
communication with the main processor modules and processing of the I/O data. Specific
customization of the core software is applied to fit the needs of the specific type of module and

– 26 –
the data to be acquired. This customization includes the integral fault detection capabilities.
Each of the three microprocessors on a module (i.e., in each of the three independent legs) runs
exactly the same FW. Each microprocessor interfaces to only one leg of the I/O bus, and thus
to only one main processor module.
As described in the preceding sections, the design of the software includes features to detect
and mitigate system faults. These features include hardware and software based diagnostics.
The diagnostic capabilities of the system are validated when hardware or software changes are
made in any module. The validation requires that the stuck at zero, stuck at one, and contact
noise from the automated fault injection system produce the pre-defined, expected diagnostic
result. Failure to produce the correct result is evaluated and corrected exactly like a failure to
produce any diagnostic result.
The level of diagnostic self test capabilities of new modules in the Tricon V10, including the
3008N MP module, is similar to the capabilities reviewed on the Tricon V9. The diagnostics are
integrated into the base Tricon V10 and require no special application programming. In
addition, data is made available to the application program concerning program operation,
results of arithmetic operations, and other internal faults. Thus, requirements imposed on the
application program relating to error detection are limited to providing appropriate error recovery
and annunciation of faults. The NRC staff observed fault detection verification testing at IOM’s
Irvine, California facility that demonstrated IOM’s method for verifying fault detection
capabilities. Faults were injected on a live card connected to an operational Tricon V10 chassis
via extender cables. Faults were assessed through a maintenance terminal connected to a
TCM module in the main chassis. A robotic system could optionally be employed to run
extensive real time fault insertion testing.
3.1.3.2

TRISTATION 1131 V4.7.0 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE

Application programming is generated using the TriStation 1131 Developer’s Workbench, which
runs on a standard PC. The current version is TriStation 1131 V4.7.0, an upgrade from
TriStation 1131 V3.1 evaluated with the Tricon V9. TriStation 1131 V4.7.0 maintains the
features described in the V9 SER (Reference 9) and adds support for 3008N MP, TCM and
NGIO modules as well as Windows XP host environment compatibility. The TriStation 1131
does not perform SR functions. It is a software tool which allows end-users to develop
application programs and download those applications to the target Tricon V10. The TriStation
1131 PC would not normally be connected while the Tricon V10 is performing safety critical
functions. However, it is physically possible for the TriStation PC to be connected at other times
and this must be prevented or controlled in a manner such that the Tristation tool cannot affect
the safety related functions of the Tricon V10 processor through plant-specific procedures and
administrative controls.
The TriStation 1131 software provides four programming languages, including Structured Text,
Function Block Diagrams, Logic Diagrams, and an IOM-defined Cause and Effect Matrix
language, called CEMPLE. The software implements a Graphical User Interface comprising
language editors, compilers, linkers, emulation, communication, and diagnostic capabilities for
the Tricon V10 PLC system.
The TriStation 1131 Developer’s Workbench translates the various languages into native mode
executable code. The Cause and Effect Matrix, Logic Diagrams, and Function Block Diagrams
are translated into Structured Text. The Structured Text is translated into an emulated code.
The emulated code is then translated into native mode assembly language. This code is then
assembled and linked with native mode code libraries to generate an executable program. Up

– 27 –
to this point, all application development may be performed off line, with no physical connection
between the TriStation PC and the Tricon V10.
The TriStation 1131 Developer’s Workbench also provides emulation capabilities for the Tricon
V10. The tool provides a capability for running an emulation code version of the program on the
PC. Capabilities exist for manual input of program variables and observation of program
outputs on the PC screen, with the inputs and output values merged and displayed with the
program blocks. The simulation function of the TriStation tool was not approved for use as a
V&V tool within the context of Tool Requirements stated in IEEE Std 7-4.3.2 in the Tricon V9
safety evaluation. Any use of the TriStation simulation functions as a means of performing V&V
activities would not be allowed unless the tool outputs are subject to complete V&V or if the tool
itself is developed using the same or equivalent high quality lifecycle process as is required for
the Tricon V10 SR software.
Compiled application programs are downloaded to the Tricon V10 through a communication
module. Programs and translated code are protected by 32-bit CRC. During the download
process, the individual communication blocks have CRC protection. Communication blocks with
computed CRC that does not match the transmitted CRC are rejected. In addition, the program
segments, which may span communication blocks, have an overall 32-bit CRC. The 32-bit CRC
for each program is stored both in the TriStation and in the Tricon V10.
The user may request a comparison between the content of the Tricon V10 and the data stored
in the TriStation to be confident that the application in the Tricon V10 and the application last
downloaded through the TriStation are identical. Comparison failures would indicate that the
application in the Tricon V10 and the content of the TriStation are no longer the same.
3.1.3.3

SAFETY-RELATED PLANT-SPECIFIC APPLICATION PROGRAM

The application program implements the desired safety system protection, monitoring, and
control functions defined by the design basis documents for the facility-specific system.
Therefore, the actual application programming is not included in the generic qualification of the
Tricon V10.
The TriStation 1131 software offers various support functions for security, change detection,
and documentation or comments integrated with the SR application programming. These
features should provide a basis on which a utility could build a workable software control and
configuration management process.
In addition to the support features offered by the TriStation 1131, the standardized language
features will aid in the development of safety critical functions. The TriStation 1131 function
subset does not allow such constructs as looping and GOTO that could inadvertently result in
infinite program flow loops or at least in non-deterministic execution timing. This reduces the
chance of bad programming constructs creating unexpected system hangs, further reducing the
chance of system failures.
3.1.3.4

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

IOM does not credit any software tools in the development of the Tricon V10 platform other than
the TriStation 1131. Although some testing requires the use of data loggers or standard
computer applications to collect data, IOM manually verifies all results.

– 28 –
3.2

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

The regulation at 10 CFR 50.55a(a)(1) requires, in part, that systems and components be
designed, tested, and inspected to quality standards commensurate with the safety function to
be performed. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.0-A, Section 3.H, “Review Process for Digital
Instrumentation and Control Systems,” states that “All software, including operating systems,
that is resident on safety system computers at runtime must be qualified for the intended
applications. Qualification may be established either by producing the PDS items under a
10 CFR 50, Appendix B quality assurance program or by dedicating the item for use in the
safety system as defined in 10 CFR 21.”
The regulatory bases used by the NRC staff for review are listed below. Also, NRC staff
evaluated V10.5.1 against RG 1.152, Revision 3, which does not consider cyber security.
Cyber security is covered under 10 CFR 73.54 and RG 5.71 and was not evaluated as part of
this LTR review.
In the case of the Tricon V9 PLC system, the NRC staff determined that the required software
documentation was contained within the following IOM documents:
•
•
•
•
•
•

IOM quality and engineering procedures, which provide planning requirements for quality
assurance, V&V, configuration management, and test activities.
The original Tricon PLC system functional requirements specifications.
A series of Tricon PLC system software design specifications that define the incremental
changes to the system.
Test procedures and test reports applicable to each system revision for both hardware
and software.
The Tricon PLC system software release definition documents that identify software
changes made in each revision.
The Tricon PLC system user documentation.

As part of its review and approval of the V9 Tricon platform, the NRC staff reviewed the
Software Qualification Report and the associated documentation, and determined that the IOM
QA and engineering procedures were of sufficient quality to provide reasonable assurance that
the development process met the provisions for software planning documents as defined in
BTP-14. In addition, the NRC staff found that the software development, V&V, and test
documentation of the Tricon PLC software was in compliance with both IOM procedural
requirements and the general requirements of current industry standards. The NRC staff further
determined that the Tricon PLC system software documentation was acceptable for software
intended for SR use in nuclear power plants.
In developing the Tricon V10 system, several additions were made to these development
processes. IOM document NTX-SER-09-05, Revision 2 (Reference 10), Tables 1-5 provide
descriptions of the changes. Changes to the three IOM documents that govern IOM internal
development, the Quality Assurance Manual (QAM), Quality Procedure Manual (QPM), and the
Engineering Department Manual (EDM) are described below:
Quality Assurance Manual (QAM) – Changes reflect integration of corporate structure with
Invensys Process Systems and expansion of scope to include 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix B and
American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) NQA-1-1994 as well as improvements to
training and customer product support. The NRC staff identified no reduction in previous
commitments.

– 29 –
Quality Procedure Manual (QPM) – Changes reflect revision to corporate structure and
improvements to commercial grade dedication, product discrepancy reporting and return
material authorizations. The NRC staff identified no reduction in previous commitments. Four
new procedures were added since 2001: Technical Support Documentation, Quality Records
Retention, Quality Surveillances, and Certification of QA Personnel.
Engineering Department Manual (EDM) – Significant additions were made to EDM 12.00,
“Product Development Process,” and EDM 12.30, “Design Reviews.” Changes reflect stronger
conformance to IEEE Std 1012, IEC 61508, and ASME NQA-1. EDM 12.00 defines the design
lifecycle phases which have not changed since reviewed for Tricon V9. The NRC staff identified
no reduction in previous commitments.
3.2.1

TRICON V10 SOFTWARE DESIGN REVIEW

The bases used by the NRC staff for the review of the Tricon V10 PLC system software include
SRP Chapter 7, BTPs 14 and 18, EPRI TR-107330, and TR-106439. IOM documented the
compliance of the Tricon V10 PLC system with these standards in IOM Document
No. 7286-545-1, Revision 4, "Triconex Topical Report" (Reference 4).
Software qualification activities involved evaluating the processes, procedures, and practices
used to develop the software; reviewing the software architecture; and assessing the history of
the software and its associated documentation and operating experience. The object of this
software qualification was to give the NRC staff reasonable assurance that the quality of the
Tricon V10 PLC system software is equivalent to the quality expected of a product developed
under a nuclear QA program complying with Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 50.
The NRC staff used the following criteria to determine the acceptability of the software used in
the Tricon V10 PLC system:
•
•
•
•
•

SRP Section 7.1, "Instrumentation and Controls – Introduction."
SRP Appendix 7.0-A, "Review Process for Digital Instrumentation and Control Systems."
BTP HICB-14, "Guidance on Software Reviews for Digital Computer-Based
Instrumentation and Control Systems."
BTP HICB-18, "Guidance on the Use of Programmable Logic Controllers in Digital
Computer-Based Instrumentation and Control Systems."
RG 1.152, Revision 3, which endorses IEEE Std 7-4.3.2, "IEEE Standard Criteria for
Digital Computers in Safety Systems of Nuclear Power Generation Stations.”

IOM submitted its evaluation of the Tricon V10 PLC system and TriStation 1131 V4.7.0
software, including documentation, development practices, and operating history against these
criteria. Details of the IOM evaluation are contained in the "Software Qualification Report," IOM
Document No. 9600164-535, Revision 1 (Reference 41), and the independent third party
review, “Critical Digital Review of the Triconex Tricon V10.2.1” (Reference 32), by MPR
Associates. The NRC staff reviewed this evaluation, as well as original design documents and
procedures, as discussed in the following subsections:
Process Documentation:
Development documentation is required by several IOM procedures. Engineering Procedure
EDM 12.00, “Product Development Process,” requires the preparation of a requirements
specifications, design specifications, detailed design documents, test plans, and test reports.
The content of these documents is specified by other procedures such as EDM 30.10,

– 30 –
“Hardware Requirements Specification,” and EDM 40.10, “Software Specification Content &
Format.” A requirements traceability matrix is required to be documented in the software design
documents. However, the current practice is to define and control requirements in the Telelogic
DOORS® requirements management tool. DOORS® provides the capability to maintain,
check, and visually display requirements traceability between requirements, detailed design,
and testing procedures, meets the intent of the requirement, and provides satisfactory control.
Traceability into the code is currently not automated in DOORS®.
Peer Review:
IOM engineering procedures prescribe several levels of work product review. In addition, peer
reviews of all controlled development documents are part of the design reviews that are
conducted in accordance with procedure EDM 12.30, “Design Reviews.” This procedure
stipulates formal, comprehensive, and documented committee reviews of all work products.
The results of these reviews, and resolution of the comments, are incorporated into
development documents and controlled. In addition, procedure EDM 21.00, “Engineering
Change Order Control,” provides for a governing body called the Change Control Board (CCB)
that is responsible for approving (along with the project manager) all engineering changes.
Validation and Testing:
Product validation is controlled by Engineering Procedure EDM 90.10, “Product Validation,”
Engineering Procedures EDM 30.30, “Hardware Test Specification,” and EDM 40.10, “Software
Specification Content & Format.” EDM 90.10 stipulates that a test plan will be developed as
part of the requirements phase of the product lifecycle. The EDMs further clarify the content of
the test plans. EDM 90.10 also describes the handling of test discrepancies and the review and
approval of test results.
Requirements Traceability:
EDM 40.10, “Software Specification Content & Format,” requires that a requirements traceability
matrix is documented in the software design documents. IOM currently uses an automated
requirements control program, DOORS® to control and document their requirements, which
meets the intent of the requirement and provides satisfactory control.
Safety Analysis:
Procedure EDM 12.00, “Product Development Process,” requires the generation of a Failure
Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as part of the design phase. Engineering Procedure
EDM 90.20, “Failure Modes and Effects Analysis,” provides guidance for the preparation of the
analysis. The software development procedures do not explicitly require a separate software
safety hazards analysis. However, the existence of fault insertion testing is considered to
partially compensate for the absence of such analysis.
Configuration Management:
Engineering Procedure EDM 20.00, “Configuration Management,” and associated procedures
describe a thorough configuration management system. This includes product identification and
change control.
Issue Tracking and Resolution:
Issue tracking and resolution is controlled by the configuration management procedures
EDM 21.10, “Engineering Change Request (ECR),” and EDM 21.30, “Change Impact Analysis.”
EDM 21.10 defines the content, generation, processing, review, and release of ECRs.
EDM 21.30 provides guidance on formally determining the impact of a product change on

– 31 –
documentation, design, and relevant standards. These procedures describe a thorough, robust
issue tracking and resolution process.
Continuing Engineering and Reporting Failures:
Continuing engineering is handled in accordance with change and issue control procedures.
Quality Assurance Procedure QAM-13.3, “10 CFR Part 21 Reporting of Defects and
Noncompliance,” provides guidance consistent with 10 CFR Part 21 for reporting defects and
deviations that could affect nuclear safety to the NRC.
IOM adopted a corporate level QAM and omitted the previously reviewed QAM. The expanded
QA program adds an additional layer of QA management, led by a single Global Nuclear QA
Director. Although the IOM V&V program is not in compliance with IEEE Std 1012, as endorsed
by RG 1.168, Revision 1, this change improves its compliance to IEEE Std 1012 regarding
organizational structure. Portions of the original QAM that were not redundant were mapped to
the QPM and EDM. IOM also significantly expanded the design process in the EDM.
EDM 12.00, “Product Development Process”, defines the established process flow and product
lifecycle phases. This procedure documents the IOM commitment to perform third party
independent reviews as recommended in the Tricon V9 SE and further strengthens their overall
commitment to IEEE Std 1012.
All Tricon configurations are independently reviewed and tested by TÜV Rheinland. As a part of
the independent review, TÜV Rheinland assesses process changes and performs full V&V
including source code reviews in accordance with IEC 61508. As NRC does not endorse
IEC 61508, the independent design review portion of the TÜV review cannot be credited.
Because TÜV performs the same tests on the Tricon as IOM performs, the independent testing
can be credited provided the design and process are independently reviewed to NRC endorsed
criteria.
It is important to note that the Tricon V10 platform includes changes that were incrementally
tested in a number of configurations since 2001. Stated another way, the most recent TÜV
testing only addresses changes made since the last commercial configuration release. The last
nuclear qualified configuration was in 2001. Therefore, all TÜV testing since 2001 that includes
changes that are part of the Tricon V10 must be credited. The NRC staff opted, based on
previous review of TÜV testing in the Tricon V9 SE, to review one representative report for the
configuration Tricon V10.2.1 because it was a significant release. The NRC staff reviewed TÜV
report 968/EZ 105.06/06 (Reference 52). The NRC staff found that the report was of similar
quality to the report accepted in the Tricon V9 SE and credit it on that basis.
The independent design review was again performed by MPR Associates. The review included
an assessment of changes to the design process since the Tricon V9 review as well as an
assessment of all the hardware and software changes. Further, MPR assessed the new
communications module (TCM) against the guidance in ISG 4 and developed application notes
for the use of the TCM in safety systems. The NRC staff thoroughly reviewed the report, IOM
Document No. 9600164-539, “Critical Digital Review (CDR) of the Triconex Tricon V10.2.1”
(Reference 32), and found it to be of similar quality to the V9 evaluation and accept it on that
basis. The CDR is referenced throughout this evaluation.
The third independent review was performed by JLM Digitech Digital Licensing Services,
“Independent Tricon V10 Equipment Qualification Assessment” (Reference 25). The report
gives an independent assessment of the qualification testing against the requirements of EPRI
TR-107330. The NRC staff determined that JLM Digitech Licensing Services independent

– 32 –
assessment was similar in quality to the MPR and TÜV independent assessments and credit it
on that basis.
During the December 2010 audit (Reference 6), the NRC staff verified line by line changes
made to a number of IOM process manuals. The NRC staff found that the audited changes
were consistent with the docketed descriptions of change (as described above) for the Tricon
V10 software quality and development processes. The audit also confirmed requirements
traceability in key areas of the Tricon V10 development, supporting IOM adherence to process.
The NRC staff found that later design documents had improved traceability, consistent with
ongoing process improvements. Requirements traceability had been identified as an area of
concern in the Tricon V9 SE.
The NRC staff determined that the software development process and the new or revised
software components developed for Tricon V10.5.1 meet the criteria of SRP Chapter 7, BTP 14,
BTP 18, EPRI TR-107330, and EPRI TR-106439. Software elements in modules that were
reused from Tricon V9.5.3 were accepted under the previous Tricon V9.5.3 SE, and are
accepted for use in Tricon V10.5.1 under this SE.
3.2.2

COMMERCIAL GRADE DEDICATION OF PREDEVELOPED SOFTWARE

EPRI TR-106439, “Guideline on Evaluation and Acceptance of Commercial Grade Digital
Equipment for Nuclear Safety Applications,” provides detailed guidance for the evaluation of
existing commercial computers and software to meet the provisions of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003,
which was endorsed in RG 1.152, Revision 2.
The CGD guidance provided in EPRI TR-106439 involves identifying the critical characteristics
of the commercial grade digital equipment based on the safety-related technical and quality
requirements, selecting appropriate methods to verify the critical characteristics to enable
dedication of the digital equipment, and maintaining the dedication basis over the service life of
the equipment. The guidance adapts the methods established in EPRI NP-5652, “Guideline for
the Utilization of Commercial Grade Items in Nuclear Safety Related Applications,” to digital
equipment and is consistent with the guidance contained in Generic Letter (GL) 89-02, “Actions
to Improve the Detection of Counterfeit and Fraudulently Marketed Products,” and GL 91-05,
“Licensee Commercial-Grade Procurement and Dedication Programs.”
EPRI TR-106439 identifies three categories of critical characteristics in terms of physical,
performance, and dependability attributes. These characteristics correspond to the categories
identified in Sub-Clause 5.4.2.2 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003, which are physical, performance, and
development process characteristics. Determination of specific critical characteristics is
accomplished by a critical design review that accounts for the requirements of the safety
application and the potential hazards that could interfere with the safety function.
Verification of the critical characteristics is at the heart of the dedication process. EPRI
TR-106439 adapts four acceptance methods defined in EPRI NP-5652 to establish an approach
to verify the characteristics for digital equipment. The four methods are:
•
•
•
•

Method 1 --- Special Tests and Inspections
Method 2 --- Commercial Grade Survey of Supplier
Method 3 --- Source Verification
Method 4 --- Acceptable Supplier/Item Performance Record

– 33 –
EPRI TR-106439 states that verification of the critical characteristics for digital equipment will
require the use of more than one of the methods since no one method will typically be sufficient
by itself.
The IOM procedure for conducting commercial grade dedication is EDM 76.00, “Dedication of
Products for Nuclear Service.” (Reference 18) The NRC staff reviewed the procedure and
concluded that IOM has properly followed their process as defined in Sections 4.3, “Dedicated
Parts Evaluation” which calls for definition of critical characteristics and evaluation by a
combination of methods 1-4 as outlined in EPRI NP-5652.
In IOM Document No. 9100055-501, “Special Dedicated Parts Evaluation, Wind River Software”
(Reference 21), IOM describes the SR function of the PDS as: “Software facilitates transfer of
communication messages in TCM as an element of TCM firmware. Operability of SW must be
highly reliable. Since this software is common to TCMs in all channels, software must have a
very low probability of common cause failure that results in inoperability.”
It further describes the critical characteristics of the item as:
1. Identification of Item (vendor part/model/version)
2. Operability/Reliability of Software
In Appendix A of IOM Document No. 9100055-501, “Special Dedicated Parts Evaluation, Wind
River Software” (Reference 21), IOM provides a detailed breakdown of the PDS components
and describes the third party PDS functionality versus the IOM generated code in the
transmission of SR data using the P2P protocol. The NRC staff used this information to better
understand the role of the third party PDS and to focus review efforts on requirements and
testing that are related to the third party PDS.
IOM states that they used a combination of EPRI NP-5652 methods 1, 3, and 4. The NRC staff
reviewed the TCM System Requirements Specification (Reference 36), the TCM Traceability
Matrix (Reference 37), IOM document, “Invensys QA Documentation Package of Wind River,
Commercial Grade Survey” (Reference 20), and IOM Document No. 9100055-501, “Special
Dedicated Parts Evaluation, Wind River Software” (Reference 21), as detailed in
Sections 3.2.2.1, 3.2.2.2, and 3.2.2.3 below and determined the third party PDS, as specifically
configured in the TCM, meets the criteria of EPRI TR-106439, IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003, and EPRI
NP-5652.
3.2.2.1

SPECIAL TESTS AND INSPECTIONS

As part of the acceptance approach for CGD of digital equipment, EPRI TR-106439 identifies
special tests and inspections as means to support verification of physical, performance, and
dependability characteristics. In addition to referencing the CGD guidance in EPRI TR-106439,
the EPRI TR-107330 guidance on generic qualification of PLCs for SR applications specifically
identifies black box testing in Section 7.6.2 as one compensatory quality activity for legacy
software to confirm conformance to its generic requirements. Code inspections, software object
testing, software component testing, and functional testing are means of generating the
compensatory evidence on critical design characteristics to confirm acceptable quality and
performance in support of the CGD of PDS.
The purpose of functional testing is to test the functionality of hardware modules and associated
software components. In this case, the integrated FW for the TCM, which includes both IOM
developed code and the PDS, must demonstrate proper operation in an integrated environment.

– 34 –
IOM Document No. 9100055-501, “Special Dedicated Parts Evaluation, Wind River Software”
(Reference 21), describes in detail the TCM functionality in relation to the PDS and IOM
components to establish the critical characteristic. As described, the critical characteristic was
verified by observing verified communications through the TCM. This makes much of the
documented testing of the Tricon V10 configured with a TCM credible for showing proper
operation of the PDS.
The NRC staff reviewed IOM Document No. 6500155-011, Revision 2.6, “TCM TSAA Software
Test Description” (Reference 38), which describes a setup with a Tricon chassis with three
3008N MP modules and a TCM connected through a network hub to a PC running the
TriStation 1131 software. Specific tests are described in this document that require reading and
writing of “bins” data in the Main Processor module using the TSAA protocol. The NRC staff
credits these tests because the data is written and read back through the TCM which verifies
data in both directions. The NRC staff further reviewed test coverage through the TCM
Traceability Matrix (Reference 37), identifying confirmation of testing of other protocols as well
as diagnostics, fault detection, and event logging.
The NRC staff determined the TCM has been thoroughly tested to demonstrate all documented
functionality sufficient to satisfy the EPRI TR-106439 criteria of functional test for CGD.
3.2.2.2

SOURCE VERIFICATION

As an element of the acceptance approach for CGD of digital equipment, EPRI TR-106439
identifies source verification as a means to support verification of dependability characteristics
for a single item or shipment of items. Of the dependability characteristics, “built-in quality”
addresses less quantifiable elements related to the development process and accompanying
documentation. EPRI TR-106439 identifies review of vendor processes and documentation as
a method of verification (associated with CGD Methods 2 or 3) for assessing the built-in quality.
These processes and documentation include: (1) design, development, and verification
processes, (2) quality assurance program and practices, and (3) V&V program and practices.
Acceptance criteria include evidence that the vendor maintains a QA program that is generally
in compliance with a recognized standard and that a process was used for legacy software
which addresses essentially the same elements as the current QA process. The methods of
verification include review of the evolution of vendor procedures and practices for software
development, V&V, and testing as well as determination of the degree to which the QA program
and software development process were applied. It is noted that preparation of supplemental
documentation may be necessary.
IOM conducted a source verification of Wind River Systems Inc. located in Alameda, California.
IOM Document No. 9100055-501, “Special Dedicated Parts Evaluation, Wind River Software”
(Reference 21), includes the definition of the critical characteristic used for source verification
activity with a supporting technical discussion that gives a detailed account of the PDS function
during SR data transfer. IOM document, “Invensys QA Documentation Package of Wind River,
Commercial Grade Survey” (Reference 20), includes the source verification plan and report with
supporting documentation of the on-site review of quality assurance, configuration management
and product verification related to the specific version of the PDS. The report concludes that the
vendor procedures and practices for software development, V&V, and testing and the
application of quality program and software development process applied to develop and
maintain the PDS provides assurance of adequate built in quality for the software.
The NRC staff reviewed the documentation package and the IOM source verification report.
The report gives background on the third party vendors’ quality process which was supported

– 35 –
with documentation of past certifications. The report further described the current quality
system, configuration management process, and V&V process. The NRC staff concluded that
the docketed information is sufficient to assess the critical characteristic described in the Special
Dedication Parts Evaluation of the PDS.
The NRC staff determined that the docketed evidence of the third party vendor’s quality system,
configuration management system, and product verification for the specific version of PDS,
meets the criteria for the source verification in EPRI TR-106439.
3.2.2.3

PERFORMANCE RECORDS

EPRI TR-106439 identifies review of product operating history as a method to support
verification of the dependability characteristics of reliability and built-in quality as part of the
acceptance approach for CGD of digital equipment. As part of the guidance on generic
qualification of PLCs for SR applications given in EPRI TR-107330, the CGD guidance in EPRI
TR-106439 is referenced as a source of acceptable compensatory quality activities for legacy
software. Section 7.6.2 of EPRI TR-107330 also specifically identifies particular compensatory
quality activities that include evaluation and analysis of documented operating experience for
product revisions involving legacy software elements in similar applications, provided the
revisions are under continuing configuration control.
IOM docketed a listing of known issues from the PDS developer in IOM document, “Invensys
QA Documentation package of Wind River, Commercial Grade Survey” (Reference 20), related
to the TCM performance. The list clearly states whether issues had been corrected or just
acknowledged. The NRC staff reviewed the list and found no outstanding issues that would
impact TCM performance. Additionally, the TCM with integrated third party PDS was originally
released with Tricon V10.0 in 2006 and was independently assessed by TÜV. The TCM has
been in commercial use for 5 years and currently has no outstanding product alert notices
(PAN) that indicate performance issues with the TCM related to the third party PDS. The NRC
staff determined the operating history of the TCM meets the criteria of EPRI TR-106439 and
supports CGD of the third party PDS.
3.3

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALIFICATION

SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.0-A (page 7.0-A-14), Section H, “Review of the Acceptance of
Commercial-Grade Digital Equipment,” contains guidance for the review of commercial
equipment and references RG 1.152, Revision 2. RG 1.152, Revision 2, endorses IEEE
Std 7-4.3.2003. IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003, Clause 5.4.2, defines the Qualification of Existing
Commercial Computers for use in SR applications in nuclear power plants. SRP Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-D, “Guidance for Evaluation of the Application of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2,” Section 5.4.2,
"Qualification of Existing Commercial Computers," provides acceptance criteria for equipment
qualifications (in accordance with IEEE Std 7-4.3.2, Clause 5.4.2). This section states that
EPRI TR-106439, "Guideline on Evaluation and Acceptance of Commercial Grade Digital
Equipment for Nuclear Safety Applications," and EPRI TR-107330, "Generic Requirements
Specification for Qualifying a Commercially Available PLC for Safety Related Applications in
Nuclear Power Plants," provide specific guidance for the evaluation of commercial grade digital
equipment and existing PLCs.
EPRI TR-107330, “Generic Requirements Specification for Qualifying a Commercially Available
PLC for Safety-Related Applications in Nuclear Power Plants,” which was accepted by an NRC
SE dated July 30, 1998, presents a set of requirements to be applied to the generic qualification
of PLCs for application to SR I&C systems in NPPs. It is intended to provide a qualification

– 36 –
envelope for a plant-specific application. It is an ASAI for the applicant/licensee to verify that
the as-tested envelope bounds the requirements of the specific application.
The Tricon V10 PLC hardware is qualified for a mild environment, such as a main control room
and auxiliary electrical equipment rooms. IOM performed pre-qualification, environmental,
seismic, electromagnetic interference/radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI), electrical fast
transient, surge withstand, and Class 1E to Non-Class 1E isolation tests; these tests were
performed in the listed order and in accordance with the requirements of EPRI TR-107330. A
test system (as described below) was assembled and used for all tests; this system was
reconfigured as necessary to support the protocol and worst-case loading scenario for each
test. IOM performed qualification testing on the following Tricon V10.2.1 equipment (see
Table 3-1), documented in the “Master Configuration List,” IOM Document No. 9600164-540
(Reference 17), as configured in the “Tricon System Description,” IOM Document
No. 9600164-541(Reference 22), and tested as specified in the following guidance; EPRI
TR-107330, EPRI TR-102323-R1, IEEE Std 323, IEEE Std 344, IEEE Std 381, IEEE Std 384,
IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003, RG 1.100, RG 1.209, and RG 1.180, Revision 1.
Qualification of Tricon V10.5.1 is by analysis based on the Tricon V10.2.1 tests and
documented in Section 4.0 of the LTR. There are no hardware differences between the Tricon
V10.2.1 and Tricon V10.5.1. The changes to the SW and their impact on qualification are
discussed in Section 3.2.1 of this SE.
IOM performed pre-qualification testing as described in EPRI TR-107330 with the exceptions
described in detail below. The following tests were performed in accordance with EPRI
TR-107330 as documented in the “Equipment Qualification Summary Report,” IOM Document
No. 9600164-545 (Reference 24); Radiation Exposure, Temperature and Humidity, Seismic,
EMI, Electrical Fast Transient Response (EFT), Surge Withstand Test, Electrostatic Discharge
(ESD), and Class 1E to Non-Class 1E Isolation Testing. Operability and prudency tests were
conducted before, during, and after the qualification testing.
IOM documented non-compliances and test anomalies in the individual qualification reports and
the qualification summary report as described below. The Tricon V10 did not fully comply with
EMI and seismic requirements, but met the criteria for the remaining tests. RG 1.180,
Revision 1, MIL-STD-461E, CE101, and CE102 requirements were not fully met. Also,
IEC 61000-4-3, Radiated Susceptibility and IEC 61000-4-6, Conducted Susceptibility were not
fully met. The specific limitations are detailed in Section 4.5 of the “Equipment Qualification
Summary Report,” IOM Document No. 9600164-545 (Reference 24) and described below.

document.
3.3.1

TEST SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

The Tricon Under Test (TUT) consisted of four Tricon chassis populated with selected input,
output, communication, and power supply modules as noted in the table above. The TUT also
included external termination assemblies provided for connection of field wiring to the Tricon
input and output modules. The System Description (Reference 22) shows the general
arrangement and interconnection of the Tricon Test Specimen chassis and provides an
overview and description of the test specimen and test system. Analog and digital inputs to the
test specimen were generated using a two-chassis simulator Tricon system. This system was
configured with a simulator application program that was used to create a variety of static and
dynamic input signals. Other test equipment was used to provide additional AIs to the TUT.
Analog and digital outputs from the TUT were monitored with indicator lights and a PC-based
data acquisition system (DAS). The DAS also monitored analog and digital inputs to the TUT.
Data was recorded and analyzed by the DAS during the various tests to verify proper operation
of individual input and output points.
Two PCs running the TriStation software were used to communicate with and monitor the status
of the TUT and the simulator Tricon system. The TriStation software used for this purpose was
TriStation 1131, which is Windows based software. During each of the qualification tests,
operation of the TUT was monitored and recorded by the DAS. The recorded data was
evaluated in detail before, during, and after the test period. The data evaluation considered
operation (per the Test Specimen Application Program (TSAP)) of at least one input or output
point on each I/O module installed in the TUT, and operation of all peripheral communication
interfaces including the Simulator Tricon Peer-to-Peer and MODBUS interfaces.
The TUT multi-channel test configuration and the overall test strategy are documented in the
“Master Test Plan,” IOM Document No. 9600164-500, Revision 5 (Reference 23). The TSAP
for the Tricon V10 was developed under IOM’s Appendix B program and was used in the
performance of qualification testing including pre- and post-qualification operational and
prudency tests. The NRC staff concluded that the TSAP met the requirements of EPRI
TR-107330, Section 6.2.2, based on its review of the “Test Specimen Application Program
Software Validation and Verification Plan,” IOM Document No. 9600164-513 (Reference 39),
“Test Specimen Application Program Software Validation and Verification Report,” IOM
Document No. 9600164-536 (Reference 40), “Independent Tricon V10 Equipment Qualification
Assessment,” Section 2.0 (Reference 25), and Appendix 2 of the “Master Test Plan”
(Reference 23).
The NRC staff notes that multi-mode fiber optic cables and any interconnecting hardware used
to connect primary and remote RXMs are not included in the qualification program. Licensees
using RXM configurations are required to supply this equipment and it is an ASAI to verify that
these user supplied components meet IOM specifications and are qualified for the specific
environmental conditions.

3.3.2

PRE-QUALIFICATION TESTING

IOM performed pre-qualification testing to (1) confirm that the Tricon PLC test system was
properly configured and operational, (2) provide baseline performance data for comparison with
data obtained during and after qualification testing, and (3) validate the test procedures.
Pre-qualification testing included the following assessments:
•
•

•

The system setup and checkout test documented proper configuration and operation of
the Tricon PLC test system, including hardware, software, input and output simulators;
test and measurement equipment; and interconnecting cabling.
The operability test to establish baseline performance included tests for analog module
accuracy, system response time, operation of discrete inputs and outputs, performance
of timer functions, failover tests (associated with the failure of redundant components),
loss of power, detection of failure to complete a scan, power interruption, and power
quality tolerance.
Prudency testing demonstrated the ability of the Tricon PLC system to operate within
specifications under dynamic conditions. The prudency test included a burst of events
test, a serial port receiver failure test, and a serial port noise test.

The pre-qualification testing was designed to follow the requirements of Section 5.2 of EPRI
TR-107330 by establishing baseline conditions for the TUT that followed the published
specifications and by verifying system configuration/setup and proper operation. This testing
exposes the TUT to various normal and abnormal conditions of input/output operation and
power source variations. This testing includes operability testing and prudency testing as
specified in EPRI TR-107330, Sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, and 6.4.3. All testing prerequisites were
met, although an engineering change order was required to address failures of two AO points
(3805 AO Module). These points were subsequently successfully retested. The system setup
and checkout test documented the proper configuration and operation of the TUT.
The establishment of the baseline performance was acceptable and the results of the prudency
testing showed the TUT was able to operate within specifications under dynamic conditions.
The pre-qualification testing and the ensuing results meet the guidance presented in EPRI
TR-107330, Section 5.
IOM described several exceptions during the prequalification tests:
•

•

PLC library Software Objects Testing – IOM did not perform software object testing as
part of the pre-qualification test. IOM Document No. 9600164-535, “Software
Qualification Report,” Sections 5.2 and 7.3 (Reference 41) described the credited testing
by independent reviewer TÜV Rheinland which includes source code reviews based on
documented requirements as well as validation testing. IOM independently verified each
incremental revision of the product in this manner. The NRC staff concludes that the
collective independent review and testing performed by TÜV Rheinland since the NRC
staff evaluated Tricon V9.5.3 is appropriately credited.
Burn-in Testing – IOM did not perform separate burn-in tests as prescribed in EPRI
TR-107330 Section 5.2F. The LTR justifies this exception by taking credit for routine
burn-in testing that is performed as part of the manufacturing process for the Tricon PLC
system hardware. The NRC staff determined that IOM manufacturing burn-in process
satisfied EPRI 107330 criteria in Section 4.1.3.1 of the V9 safety evaluation
(Reference 9).

– 40 –
•

Response Time - EPRI TR-107330 Section 4.2.1.A gives a response time requirement
of 100 msec based on a given list of test set requirements. The IOM test configuration
required to adequately meet other qualification testing requirements does not conform to
the given response time test set criteria. The Tricon response time is dependent on
specific system configuration and is calculated for each application. The acceptance
criteria used for NRC staff’s evaluation is based on the calculated maximum response
times given in IOM Document No. 9600164-731 Section 4.0 (Reference 43). Tested
maximum response times (which met the calculated response times) were given in IOM
Document No. 9600164-566, Section 6.0 (Reference 44); DI to DO loop 83.0 msec, AI to
DO loop 119.0 msec, AI to AO loop 126.5 msec. Similar exception was approved by the
NRC staff in Section 4.3.5 of the V9 SE (Reference 9).

RADIATION WITHSTAND TEST

Radiation testing of the Tricon was performed in accordance with the requirements of EPRI
TR-107330 Sections 4.3.6.1 and 4.3.6.2 and IEEE Std 381-1977 at the University of
Massachusetts, Lowell. The Tricon met all applicable performance requirements after
application of the radiation test conditions. The radiation test included the withstand capability
of the Tricon to a rapid dose of radiation that would be normally provided as a long term, low
level 1000 RAD gamma dose integrated over a 40 year period in a mild environment.
The radiation test acceptance criteria are as given below based on Appendix 4 of the Master
Test Plan (Reference 23) and EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.3.6:
•

•
•

The TUT shall not exhibit any exterior damage or degradation as a result of gamma
radiation exposure based on visual examinations performed following Radiation
Exposure Testing. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, blistered protective
coatings, deformation, crazing or discoloration of plastic components, and deformed or
visually embrittled cable insulation.
The TUT shall pass the post radiation operability test following the completion of
radiation exposure testing.
The TUT shall pass the post radiation prudency test following the completion of radiation
exposure testing.

Radiation exposure testing of the TUT was performed on December 13 and 14, 2006, at the
University of Massachusetts, Lowell. The testing complied with the specific requirements of
EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.3.6, and the general requirements of IEEE Std 381-1977. TUT

– 41 –
components were exposed to Co60 gamma radiation doses of 1000 RAD plus margin in
exposures just over 2 hours in duration. Due to limitations of the source and the size of the
overall test set, components were exposed separately. Each component received the required
dose plus margin.
Post testing inspection revealed no visible effects from the exposure. Operability and prudency
test results shows that exposure to the radiation test conditions had no adverse effect on the
TUT.
The NRC staff reviewed the “Radiation Test Report,” IOM Document No. 9600164-533
(Reference 45), and determined that the level of exposure is consistent with installation in a mild
environment, as specified in Section 4.3.6 of EPRI TR-107330 and IEEE Std 381-1977. On the
basis of these tests, the NRC staff concludes that the Tricon V10 PLC system hardware is
qualified to the radiation exposure levels specified in the EPRI TR and the IEEE standard.
However, before installing plant-specific Tricon PLC system equipment, licensees will need to
verify that the expected radiation exposure for the equipment is enveloped by the radiation
withstand capacity of the Tricon PLC system equipment. This is an ASIA.
3.3.4

TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY TESTING

Environmental qualification testing of the TUT was performed in accordance with EPRI
TR-107330, Sections 4.3.6 and 6.3.3, and IEEE Std 381-1977 and includes the following:
•

•
•
•

The test PLC shall meet its performance requirements during and following exposure to
abnormal environmental conditions of 40 °F to 140 °F and 5 percent to 95 percent
relative humidity (RH) (non-condensing) according to a time varying profile (see
Figure 4-4 of the EPRI TR-107330).
Environmental testing shall be performed with the power supply sources set to values
that maximize heat dissipation in the test PLC.
Power supplies shall be loaded such that nominal current draws at nominal power
supply output voltages are equal to the power supply rating.
The test PLC shall be powered with its TSAP operating during environmental testing,
with 1/2 of the discrete and relay outputs ON and loaded to their rated current. In
addition, all AOs shall be set to between 1/2 and 2/3 of full scale. Section 4.3.6.2 of
EPRI TR-107330 requires that the generic PLC meet its performance requirements over
abnormal environmental conditions of 40 °F to 120 °F and 10 percent to 95 percent RH
(non-condensing). Section 4.3.6.3 of EPRI TR-107330 requires that the test PLC
operate for the environmental (temperature and humidity) withstand profile given in
Figure 4-4 of the TR. The profile includes a beginning ramp-up period (unspecified in
duration) from ambient to 140 °F and 90 percent RH (non-condensing). These
conditions are held for 48 hours minimum, after which the Operability and Prudency
tests are run. Conditions are then ramped down over a four hour minimum period to 40
°F and 5 percent relative humidity. These conditions are held for 8 hours minimum, after
which a second Operability test is run. Conditions are then ramped up over a four hour
minimum period to ambient temperature and relative humidity. The equipment is
stabilized at ambient conditions, after which a final Operability test is run. Section 6.3.3
of EPRI TR- 107330 requires that Environmental Testing be performed with margins of
5 F and 5 percent applied to the temperature and humidity values given above.

The environmental test acceptance criteria are as given below based on Appendix 5 of the
Master Test Plan (Reference 23), and EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.3.6:

– 42 –
•
•
•

The TUT shall operate as intended during and after exposure to the environmental test
conditions. Evaluation of normal operating performance data (inputs, outputs and
diagnostic indicators) collected during testing shall demonstrate operation as intended.
The TUT shall pass the Operability Test following at least 48 hours of operation at high
temperature and humidity, following at least 8 hours of operation at low temperature and
humidity and upon completion of the test.
The TUT shall pass the Prudency Test following at least 48 hours of operation at high
temperature and humidity.

Environmental testing of the TUT was performed on December 13, 2006, through January 15,
2007, at National Technical Systems in Boxborough, Massachusetts. Results of the testing are
described in “Environmental Test Report,” IOM Document No. 9600164-525 (Reference 46). As
described in the test report and depicted below in Figure 3.3.4-1, the actual sequence of testing
was as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Installation in the National Technical Systems environmental test chamber, and
stabilization at ambient temperature and relative humidity conditions.
Ramp-up to 140 °F and 95 percent RH over a 4 hour period.
Hold at 140 °F and 95 percent RH for a 1 hour period.
Troubleshoot test system for a 1 hour period.
Hold at 140 °F and 95 percent RH for a 47 hour period.
High temperature Operability Test performed over an 8 hour period.
High temperature Prudency Test performed over a 2.5 hour period.
Attempt ramp-down to 35 °F and 5 percent RH over a 17 hour period.
Return to ambient and perform repairs of test chamber over a 100 hour period.
Ramp-down to 35 °F and 5 percent RH over a 6 hour period.
Hold at 35 °F and 5 percent RH for an 8 hour period.
Low temperature Operability Test performed over a 9 hour period
Ramp-up to ambient temperature and RH over a 5 hour period.
Hold at ambient temperature and RH for a 2 hour period.
Ambient temperature Operability Test performed over a 13 hour period.

The environmental chamber experienced a mechanical failure during the transition from high
temperature, high humidity conditions to low temperature conditions. The transition was
originally planned to occur in no less than four hours as prescribed by requirements. As a result
of the chamber failure, the TUT was returned to ambient conditions for approximately 100
hours. On repair of the chamber, the transition to low temperature was continued and required
approximately six hours. The NRC staff reviewed the details of the test equipment failure as
described in the “Environmental Test Report,” IOM Document No. 9600164-525 (Reference 46)
and concluded that the minimum four hour transition time is not a challenging temperature
transition and because the equipment under test was not disturbed, the delay at ambient for test
chamber repairs does not significantly impact the outcome of the test. The separate
manufacturing burn-in performed on all production Tricon equipment, including the equipment
used for this test, also provides support that the equipment performs as designed.
IOM recorded two internal diagnostic faults during the high temperature hold period. As
described in the Environmental Test Report (Reference 46), the Model 3708E thermocouple
input module reported a diagnostic fault message during the high temperature hold period. The
fault cleared automatically during ramp-down from the high temperature hold period. The
normal operating performance data recorded during Environmental Testing showed that the
affected points of the module continued to operate correctly in the presence of the fault. The

– 43 –
high temperature Operability Test analog I/O accuracy data shows that the points of the module
continued to meet the accuracy specifications in the presence of the fault. Model 3623T 120
VDC digital output module also reported a diagnostic fault message during the high temperature
hold period. The detected fault did not impact the proper operation of the TUT during testing.
IOM performed operability and prudency tests both during and after the environmental test. No
adverse effect on the TUT performance were reported.
The NRC staff reviewed the “Environmental Test Report,” IOM Document No. 9600164-525
(Reference 46) and determined that the Tricon V10 met the requirements of EPRI TR-107330,
Sections 4.3.6 and 6.3.3, and IEEE Std 381-1977.

SEISMIC WITHSTAND TESTING

To demonstrate that the Tricon V10 meets the requirements for Seismic Category 1 Safety
System, IOM subjected the TUT to seismic simulation testing during Safe Shutdown Earthquake
(SSE) and Operating Basis Earthquakes (OBEs). Seismic Testing conforms to the
requirements of IEEE Std 344-1987 and Sections 4.3.9 and 6.3.4 of EPRI TR-107330. In
addition to demonstrating the performance requirements under the specified conditions, a
resonance search procedure was also conducted.
Attachment 6 of the Master Test Plan (Reference 23) describes the seismic test plan. The
Seismic Test Procedure is IOM Document No. 9600164-507. For seismic testing, IOM
performed a resonance search followed by five simulated OBEs and one simulated SSE at
9.75 g’s and 14 g’s respectively, based on 5 percent damping. The simulation vibrations are
required to be applied tri-axially (in three orthogonal directions), with random frequency content.
Seismic testing was performed at NTS facilities in Acton, Massachusetts. NTS personnel
provided testing services and established test conditions as specified in the TR-107330
specification, including documenting the mounting of the TUT to the seismic test apparatus.

– 44 –
The TSAP was loaded and operating during seismic testing, exercising all TUT components,
and supporting automated test data collection. The resulting data documented TUT operation in
accordance with the applications depicted in the project functional diagrams. Data also
supports monitoring performance of the module 3636T electromechanical relay contacts during
testing. Additionally, operability testing was conducted at the completion of the seismic tests.
The seismic test acceptance criteria are as given below based on Appendix 6 of the Master Test
Plan, Reference 23, and EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.3.9:
•
•
•

•

The TUT shall operate as intended during and after application of the OBE and SSE
vibrations. Evaluation of normal operating performance data (inputs, outputs, and
diagnostic indicators) shall demonstrate operation as intended.
During and after application of the OBE and SSE vibrations, all connections on the TUT
shall remain intact, all modules installed in the TUT shall remain fully inserted, and no
functional or non-functional parts of the TUT shall fall off.
The operation of the chassis power supply normally open alarm relay contacts and the
Model 3636T electromechanical relay module output contacts shall be monitored during
application of the OBE and SSE vibrations. The relay contacts shall change state in
accordance with the TSAP. Any spurious change of state of the relay contacts shall not
exceed 2 msec in duration. Any spurious change of state of the power supply alarm
relay contacts from open to closed shall not exceed 2 msec in duration.
The TUT shall pass the Operability Test following completion of the seismic testing.

The TUT was populated with selected main processor, input, output, communication, chassis
interface, and chassis power supply modules. The TUT power was supplied by variable AC and
DC power sources configured as described in the “Seismic Test Procedure,” IOM Document
No. 9600164-507. During seismic testing, both power supply modules in each chassis were
energized. Chassis 1 and 2 each included a 120 VAC chassis power supply module and a
24 VDC chassis power supply module. Chassis 3 and 4 each included a 120 VAC chassis
power supply module and a 230 VAC chassis power supply module. However, to
accommodate seismic testing at minimum external power supply voltages, the test system
power supply configuration was temporarily modified for testing of TUT Chassis 3 and 4 to allow
the voltages to the 120 VAC and 230 VAC chassis power supply modules to be set
independently. The power supplies to the 120 VAC and 230 VAC chassis power supply
modules were set to the minimum allowable operating voltage as specified by the manufacturer.
The TUT chassis was mounted to the seismic test table in accordance with mounting details
provided on IOM Drawing No. 9600164-102. The seismic test mounting simulated a typical 19inch rack mount configuration using standard Tricon V10 front and rear chassis mounting
brackets and fastener hardware, and standard Tricon V10 external termination assembly
mounting plates. Details on the equipment arrangement for seismic testing are provided in the
IOM Seismic Test Report (Reference 27).
The TSAP was loaded and operating during seismic testing, exercising all TUT components,
and supporting automated test data collection. The TSAP revision used was
“V10_TSAPREV_0.” During seismic testing, the relay output configuration did not meet the
requirements of Section 6.3.4.2 of EPRI TR-107330. However, a large number of relay output
points (32 total) were monitored, which IOM considered a significantly representative number of
relay output points, and thus, met the intent of the TR-107330 requirement to have points in
both the ON and OFF positions throughout testing.

– 45 –
The Tricon V10 did not fully comply with the seismic requirements. The seismic table achieved
the EPRI TR-107330 OBE and SSE Required Response Spectrum test levels throughout most
of the required frequency range. Test equipment limitations resulted in a reduced response
spectrum during the performance of seismic testing. Specifically, in the low frequency region
(below 6 Hz), limitations of the table velocity and displacement prevented achieving the full
EPRI TR-107330 Required Response Spectrums.
The as-tested spectrum is depicted in the LTR and shown below. Results of the testing are
described in the Seismic Test Report, Reference 27.
Resonance search testing demonstrated that the simulated mounting configuration was stiff
enough so that there were no resonances below 100 Hz. Specifically, for seismic testing, the
weight loadings of the four TUT chassis were varied from light (chassis 3) to moderate
(chassis 2) to heavy (chassis 1 and 4) to demonstrate seismic vibration susceptibility for various
chassis loadings.
Table 5-1 of EPRI TR-107330 requires that Operability and Prudency Testing be performed
during SSE. Because the duration of each OBE/SSE test (approximately 30 seconds) did not
support full Operability or Prudency Testing, IOM did not perform the Operability and Prudency
Tests during the Seismic Tests. Data collected during and after each OBE and SSE test
demonstrated that the TUT operated as intended throughout the testing.
Table 5-1 and Section 6.3.4.3 of EPRI TR-107330 require post-seismic Operability Testing to
assess the impact of exposure to the OBE and SSE vibrations on the operability of the test
specimen. Test results provided in the Seismic Test Report showed that exposure to the OBE
and SSE vibrations had no adverse effects on the
TUT performance.
The TUT was visually inspected for damage or degradation following each OBE and SSE test.
During inspection of Chassis 1 and 2, after OBE test No. 3, IOM had to address problems with
the interface cable connection. A cable restraint at the tie-down point was modified, retesting
was not required. To avoid this problem in a plant-specific installation, IOM’s field installation
guidance will describe how to secure this cable. In addition, there were other cases of physical
damage and degradation in TUT Chassis 1 and 2 during OBE tests, but these were corrected,
and the equipment was successfully retested.
During setup/checkout testing, IOM determined that an interposing relay would be required to
monitor the chassis alarm contacts as a result of the test setup. This configuration had a
potential to mask contact chatter during the test. Therefore, the TUT chassis alarm relays were
not seismically qualified as part of seismic testing.
The NRC staff determined that the tested Tricon V10 system equipment is qualified to the tested
triaxial seismic simulator table limits shown in Figures 3.3.5-1 through 3.3.5-3 below, with the
exception of the low frequency region (below 6 Hz). For this reason the NRC staff finds that the
Tricon V10 system did not fully meet the requirements of EPRI TR-107330 for seismic
requirements, and before using Tricon V10 system equipment in SR systems in a NPP,
licensees must determine that the plant-specific seismic requirements are enveloped by the
capabilities of the Tricon V10 system. This determination and the suitability of the Tricon V10
system for a particular plant and application is the responsibility of the licensee.

EMI/RFI WITHSTAND TESTING

EPRI TR-107330 includes electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing as part of the overall
program to generically qualify a PLC for SR application in a NPP. Specifically, criteria for
electromagnetic emissions, EMI susceptibility, electrostatic discharge withstand, power surge
withstand, and isolation capability are given in Sections 4.3, “Hardware Requirements,” and 4.6,
“Electrical,” of the guide while the qualification approach is specified in Section 6.3,
“Qualification Tests and Analysis Requirements.” The methods for implementing EMC testing
are provided by other referenced guides, as discussed below.
RG 1.180, “Guidelines for Evaluating Electromagnetic and Radio-Frequency Interference in
Safety-Related Instrumentation and Control Systems,” endorses MIL-STD-461E, “Requirements
for the Control of Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment,”
and IEC 61000 series standards for the evaluation of the impact of EMI, radio-frequency
interference (RFI) and power surges on SR I&C systems, and to characterize the
electromagnetic (EM) emissions from the I&C systems.

– 49 –
EPRI TR-102323, “Guideline for Electromagnetic Interference Testing in Power Plants,”
provides alternatives to performing site-specific EMI/RFI surveys to qualify digital safety I&C
equipment for a plant’s EM environment. In an SE issued in 1996, the NRC staff concluded that
the recommendations and guidelines in EPRI TR-102323 provide an adequate method for
qualifying digital l&C equipment for a NPP’s EM environment without the need for plant-specific
EMI/RFI surveys if the plant-specific EM environment is confirmed to be similar to that identified
in EPRI TR-102323.
EMI and RFI testing was performed in accordance with EPRI TR-102323, Revision 1,
Section 6.3.2 of EPRI TR-107330, and RG 1.180, Revision 1, to demonstrate the suitability of
the Tricon V10 platform for qualification as a SR device with respect to EMI/RFI emissions and
susceptibility.
All of the TUT components were subjected to EMI/RFI testing as required. EMI/RFI testing of
the TUT was performed inside open frame racks. The testing was performed in accordance
with EPRI TR-107330 and RG 1.180 test method requirements.
The specific tests conducted include the following MIL-STD-461E and IEC test methods:
The following EMI/RFI emissions tests were performed:
•
•
•
•

MIL-STD-461E, Test Method CE101, Conducted Emissions, 30 Hz to 10 kHz

MIL-STD-461E, Test Method RE102, Radiated Emissions, 2 MHz to 1 GHz

The following EMI/RFI susceptibility tests were performed:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

IEC 61000-4-3, Radiated Susceptibility, 26 MHz to 1 GHz
IEC 61000-4-6, Conducted Susceptibility, 150 kHz to 80 MHz

IEC 61000-4-13, Conducted Susceptibility, Harmonics and Interharmonics
IEC 61000-4-16, Conducted Susceptibility, Common-Mode Disturbances

The EMI/RFI test acceptance criteria are as follows, based on Appendix 7 of the “Master Test
Plan,” IOM Document No. 9600164-500 (Reference 23), and EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.3.7:
•
•

The TUT shall meet allowable equipment emission limits as specified in RG 1.180,
Revision 1, for conducted and radiated emissions.
The TUT shall operate as intended during and after application of the EMI/RFI test levels
specified in RG 1.180 for conducted and radiated susceptibility.

In addition, evaluation of normal operating performance data (inputs, outputs, and diagnostic
indicators) shall demonstrate operation as intended, including the following specific operational
performance criteria from Section 4.3.7 of EPRI TR-107330:
•
•
•
•

The main processors and coprocessors shall continue to function
The transfer of I/O data shall not be interrupted
The emissions shall not cause the discrete I/O to change state
Analog I/O levels shall not vary more than 3 percent

– 50 –
EMI/RFI testing of the Tricon V10 was performed from February 17 through April 16, 2007, at
National Technical Systems in Boxboro, Massachusetts. The TUT was installed in the EMI/RFI
chamber in open-frame racks as required by the EPRI TR-107330. Wiring connections and
grounding were in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Additional EMI/RFI
protective and mitigating devices such as power or I/O line filters, enclosed cabinets, and extra
cable shielding were not used so that the specific emissions and susceptibilities of the
equipment could be determined.
During EMI/RFI testing, the TUT was powered with TSAP operating. The AC and DC power
sources to the TUT chassis power supplies were set at nominal source voltage and frequency
conditions. In order to minimize transmission of outside EMI/RFI sources into the EMI/RFI test
chamber, all power, signal, and communications cables entering the EMI/RFI test chamber were
passed through filters located in the chamber walls. Because the number of pass-through filters
was limited, only one circuit per I/O module was connected. The results of the EMI/RFI testing
on the TUT, as documented in “EMI/RFI Test Report,” IOM Document No. 9600164-527
(Reference 26), are as follows:
The TUT does not fully comply with the allowable equipment emissions levels defined in
RG 1.180, Revision 1, for MIL-STD-461E, CE101, and CE102 testing.

The TUT discrete and analog I/O hardware, which does not fully comply with the minimum
susceptibility thresholds required by RG 1.180, Revision 1, for the EMI/RFI susceptibility tests
as listed below:

• Due to test execution anomalies, the results of this testing were determined not to be
valid. Therefore, compliance with IEC 61000-4-10 is indeterminate.
The NRC staff reviewed the “EMI/RFI Test Report,” IOM Document No. 9600164-527
(Reference 26), and determined that the tested Tricon V10 system met the EMI/RFI test
acceptance criteria discussed above and is qualified up to the tested limits described above,
with the exceptions as noted for the 8310 High Density Power Module (120VAC), 8312 High
Density Power Module (230VAC), RTD Conditioning Modules 1600083-600, 1600083-200,
1600024-020, 1600024-030, 1600081-001, Digital Output Module 3601T (115VAC) with
ETA 9663-610N, and the IEC 61000-4-10 testing.
Given the exceptions noted above, the NRC staff determined that the Tricon V10 PLC system
did not fully meet the guidance of RG 1.180, Revision 1, for conducted or radiated emissions or
susceptibility. Before using the Tricon V10 system equipment in SR systems in a nuclear power
plant, licensees must determine that the plant-specific EMI requirements are enveloped by the
capabilities of the Tricon V10 system as approved in this SE. This determination and the
suitability of the Tricon V10 system for a particular plant and application is the responsibility of
the licensee.
3.3.6.1

ELECTRICAL FAST TRANSIENT

RG 1.180, Revision 1, Section 5.3, requires that the PLC under qualification be tested for
electrical fast transient (EFT) susceptibility in accordance with the requirements of
IEC 61000-4-4. RG 1.180, Sections 5.3 and 4.2, include the requirements for EFT testing of the
AC and DC power supplies and signal leads respectively.
EFT testing of the TUT is described in the “EFT Test Procedure,” IOM Document
No. 9600164-514. The TUT was subjected to the following EFT tests:
•
•
•
•
•
•

EFT testing of the TUT was performed from March 26 through 28, 2007, at National Technical
Systems in Boxborough, Massachusetts. During EFT testing, the TUT was powered with the
TSAP operating. The AC and DC power sources to the TUT chassis power supplies were set at
nominal source voltage and frequency conditions. The arrangement and grounding of the
system during EFT testing was as described for the EMI/RFI tests.
During EFT testing, operation of the TUT was monitored by the DAS. The recorded data was
evaluated in detail before, during, and after each test to verify normal operation of the system

SURGE WITHSTAND TESTING

EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.6.2, requires that surge withstand testing of the PLC be conducted
in accordance the requirements of EPRI TR-102323. RG 1.180, Revision 1, provides an NRC
approved alternative to the Surge Withstand Testing specified in EPRI TR-102323. Surge
Withstand Testing of the TUT AC power supplies was performed in accordance with
IEC 61000-4-5 and IEC 61000-4-12 requirements.

Master Test Plan (Reference 23) and EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.6.2:
•

•

•

Applying the surge test voltages specified in Tables 15 and 22 of RG 1.180, Revision 1,
to the specified TUT test points shall not damage any other module or device in the TUT,
or cause disruption of the operation of the TUT backplane signals or any other data
acquisition signals that could result in a loss of the ability to generate a trip.
Evaluation of normal operating performance data (inputs, outputs and diagnostic
indicators) shall demonstrate satisfactory operation of the TUT during and after
application of the surge test voltage. The data evaluations shall demonstrate that
modules other than the one tested are not damaged and do not experience disruption of
their operation.
Per Section 6.3.5 of TR-107330, failures of one or more redundant devices are
acceptable so long as the failures do not result in the inability of the TUT to operate as

– 54 –
intended. No faults or failures of redundant devices occurred during Surge Withstand
Testing.
The surge withstand testing was performed from March 28 through April 13, 2007, at National
Technical Systems in Boxborough, Massachusetts. Prior to the start of testing, all of the TUT
modules (Main Processors (MPs), communication, and I/O) were removed and replaced with
spare modules. This was done to protect the modules which had been through environmental,
seismic, and EMI/RFI testing from damage that could occur during surge withstand testing, and
preserve the condition of the original modules for final performance proof testing.
During surge withstand testing, the TUT was powered with the TSAP operating. The AC and
DC power sources to the TUT chassis power supplies were set at nominal source voltage and
frequency conditions. The arrangement and grounding of the system during surge withstand
testing was as described for the EMI/RFI tests.
During surge withstand testing, operation of the TUT was monitored by the DAS. The recorded
data was evaluated in detail before, during, and after each test to verify normal operation of the
system and all peripheral communication interfaces. Results of the surge withstand testing are
documented in the Surge Withstand Test Report. Data collected during and after each voltage
tests demonstrate that the TUT operated as intended throughout the testing.

3.3.9

CLASS 1E TO NON-1E ISOLATION TESTING

IOM performed isolation testing on the Tricon PLC test system in accordance with IEEE Std 384
and Section 6.3.6 of EPRI TR-107330. In particular, IEEE Std 384-1981 requires that: (a) the
isolation device prevents shorts, grounds, and open circuits on the Non-Class 1E side from
unacceptably degrading the operation of the circuits on the Class 1E side and (b) the isolation
device prevents application of the maximum credible voltage on the Non-Class 1E side from
degrading unacceptably the operation of the circuits on the Class 1E side. The details of the
tests are described in the “Class 1E to Non-1E Isolation Test Procedure,” IOM Document
No. 9600164-509.

– 58 –
The qualification of the Tricon V10 PLC is based on a system design which connects
Non-Class 1E input/output circuits to modules installed in one or more separate chassis which
are interfaced to the Class 1E portion of the PLC by fiber optic cables. This design provides
electrical isolation of the Non-Class 1E input/output circuits because the fiber optic cables are
incapable of transmitting electrical faults. Based on this system design, only the communication
modules installed in the main chassis are required to provide Class 1E to Non-Class 1E
electrical isolation capability (if these modules are used to interface to Non-Class 1E
communication equipment). Accordingly, the TCM Module, RS-232 (MODBUS) was tested for
Class 1E isolation capability. In addition, the 3636T Relay Output Module was tested for Class
1E electrical isolation capability. This allows interface to Non-Class 1E circuits (such as alarms
or annunciators) without having to install a separate, fiber optically isolated chassis.
The objective of Class 1E to Non-Class 1E isolation testing is to demonstrate the suitability of
the Tricon V10 PLC for qualification as a SR, Class 1E device with respect to providing
electrical isolation at Non-Class 1E field connections. The “Class 1E to Non-1E Isolation Test
Report” (Reference 57), IOM Document No. 9600164-529, summarizes the results of isolation
testing.
Isolation requirements for the Tricon communication modules were performed as part of the
Prudency Test. During prudency testing, the TUT response time was monitored and shown not
to degrade for the TUT hardware configuration and TSAP. Further, IOM performed
communication port fault testing. The testing involved subjecting the TUT communication ports
to simulated faults of the receive line (the transmit line of the connected device) including open
circuits, short circuits to ground, short circuits to the transmit line, and superimposed “white”
noise. Test results show that the applied faults had no adverse effects on the TUT response
time. These results are documented in the “Performance Proof Prudency Test Report,” IOM
Document No. 9600164-573 (Reference 56).
The TUT was installed in the NTS anechoic test chamber and mounted in open instrument
cabinets. The electrical feeds to the TUT chassis power supplies were passed through filter
capacitors and Line Impedance Stabilization Networks (LISNs) to minimize transmission of
noise into and out of the test chamber and to standardize the effective impedance of the power
supply circuits. The TUT input and output circuits were passed into the test chamber through
EMI filters, also to minimize transmission of noise into and out of the test chamber. The AC and
DC power sources to the TUT chassis power supplies were set at nominal source voltage and
frequency conditions. The arrangement and grounding of the system during isolation testing
was the same as for the EMI/RFI tests. At least one point on each I/O module was monitored
for proper operation, and the communications modules were exercised through interfaces with
external monitoring devices. The following TUT components were subjected to the isolation
tests:
120 VAC/VDC Relay Output Module Model 3636T, Relay Output Point
• 600 VAC and 250 VDC for 30 sec, Line-to-Line, Output Point Open
• 600 VAC and 250 VDC for 30 sec, Line-to-Line, Output Point Closed
• 600 VAC and 250 VDC for 30 sec, Line-to-Ground, Output Point Open
• 600 VAC and 250 VDC for 30 sec, Line-to-Ground, Output Point Closed
Tricon Communication Module (TCM) Model 4352A, MODBUS Serial Port
• 250 VAC and 250 VDC for 30 seconds, Receive-to-Transmit Pins
• 250 VAC and 250 VDC for 30 seconds, All Pins to Ground

– 59 –
During isolation testing, operation of the TUT was monitored by the DAS. The recorded data
was evaluated in detail before, during, and after each isolation test to verify normal operation of
the system and all peripheral communication interfaces. The test details are described in the
Isolation Test Report (Reference 57).
Section 4.6.4 of EPRI TR-107330 requires that the PLC modules under qualification provide
electrical isolation capability of at least 600 VAC and 250 VDC applied for 30 seconds. Per
Section 7.2.2.1 of IEEE Std 384-1981, the highest voltage to which an isolation device NonClass 1E side is exposed shall determine the minimum voltage level that the device shall
withstand across the Non-Class 1E side terminals, and between the Non-Class 1E terminals
and ground. The communication cables connected to the Tricon V10 TCM communication
modules are expected to be routed separately from high voltage (greater than 120 VAC) cables.
A line-to-line short to a three conductor 120 VAC cable could result in a maximum possible
voltage exposure of 240 VAC. Therefore, the TCM MODBUS serial communication ports were
tested for a maximum isolation capability of 250 VAC and 250 VDC (at 10 amps maximum)
applied for 30 seconds. The Model 3636T Relay Output Module was tested to the full EPRI
TR-107330 voltage levels of 600 VAC (at 25 amps maximum) and 250 VDC (at 10 amps
maximum) as listed above.
The Class 1E to Non-Class 1E Isolation Test results demonstrates that the Model 3636T Relay
Output Module and the Model 4352A Tricon Communication Module provide adequate electrical
isolation per IEEE Std 384-1981 between the SR portions of the Tricon V10 PLC and connected
NSR field circuits. The testing demonstrated electrical isolation capability of the relay output
points to applied voltages of 600 VAC (at 25 amps maximum) and 250 VDC (at 10 amps
maximum).
The Tricon V10 PLC Model 4201 Remote RXM fiber optic module was not tested because fiber
optic cables are incapable of transmitting electrical faults from the remote Non-Class 1E RXM
module to the primary RXM (which would be installed in the SR Tricon chassis). Thus, the
Tricon V10 Model 4201 Remote RXM fiber optic module is considered an acceptable Class 1E
to Non-Class 1E isolation device by design.
The TUT met all applicable performance requirements during and after application of the
Class 1E to Non-Class 1E isolation test voltages. The specific Tricon hardware which was
tested (chassis, power supplies, modules, external termination assemblies, and interconnecting
cabling) is identified in the project Master Configuration List (Reference 17).
The isolation test results (together with the Prudency Test communication port fault tests)
demonstrated that the Tricon Model 4352A TCM Module MODBUS serial communication ports
provide adequate electrical isolation per IEEE Std 384-1981 between the SR portions of the
Tricon V10 and connected NSR communication circuits. In addition, the testing demonstrated
electrical isolation capability of the TCM MODBUS serial communication ports to applied
voltages of 250 VAC and 250 VDC (at 10 amps maximum) for 30 seconds.
The NRC staff determined that the Tricon V10 system met the criteria of IEEE Std 384-1981
and Section 6.3.6 of EPRI TR-107330. It is the responsibility of the license to verify that the
maximum test voltages cited above envelop the maximum credible voltages applied to
Non-Class 1E interfaces.

3.3.10

PERFORMANCE PROOF TESTING

Performance proof testing was conducted at the completion of all qualification testing to
demonstrate the continued acceptable performance of the TUT after being exposed to various
qualification test conditions. Performance proof tests are merely a repeat of selected
prequalification baseline tests to identify any changes in equipment performance. Performance
proof testing includes operating the test system for 7 days with an elevated DC source,
operability test, and prudency test. Appendix 9 of the Master Test Plan (Reference 23)
describes the test plan for proof testing. Test procedures were developed for the operability
test, IOM Document No. 9600164-566 and Prudency Test, IOM Document No. 9600164-573.
Performance proof testing was performed at the IOM facilities in Irvine, California. Test results
are documented in the Performance Proof Operability Test Report (Reference 44) and
Performance Proof Prudency Test Report (Reference 56). The results are contrasted to initial
recorded benchmark performance data, as well as test data collected during environmental and
seismic testing.
The Operability Test Procedure, Performance Proof Test successfully established performance
data for the TUT in accordance with the IOM published specifications and/or EPRI TR-107330
specifications and all acceptance criteria stated in the procedure were met. In addition, the test
results of the Operability Test Procedure, Pre-Qualification Test and Operability Test Procedure,
Performance Proof Test were analyzed to determine any degradation in the performance of the
TUT. The analyses established that the TUT performed in accordance with IOM published
specifications and/or EPRI TR-107330 specifications before and after Qualification Tests and no
degradation in the performance of the TUT were identified. Conclusions from this test are
summarized below.
1. Analog Input/Output Module Accuracy – This test shall demonstrate that the overall
accuracy of each AI and output module shall meet IOM published specifications.
For all operability test runs, the accuracy of each analog I/O module of the TUT was
demonstrated to meet the IOM published specifications. In addition, the test results show
no degradation in module accuracy from pre-qualification testing throughout qualification
and performance proof testing.
2. Response Time – This test shall demonstrate that the measured loop response times shall
not vary more than ±10 percent from the baseline TUT loop response times. EPRI
TR-107330, Section 4.2.1.A, requires an overall response time of 100 msec or less.
For all operability test runs, the response times for digital input to digital output, AI to digital
output and digital output and “round-robin” sequences of the TUT were measured. The test
data demonstrates that the maximum response time equation provides a reliable upper
bound on the maximum expected response times for a specific TUT hardware configuration
and TSAP.
Note that the TUT loop response times are a function of its actual hardware configuration
and the scan time of the TSAP. The specified absolute response time is therefore not
applicable to testing of the TUT and the TUT loop response times were measured during
this test.

– 61 –
3. Discrete Input Operation – This test shall demonstrate that the OFF to ON and ON to OFF
voltage switching levels of each tested digital input module point shall meet IOM published
specifications.
For all Operability Test runs, the OFF to ON and ON to OFF voltage switching levels of each
digital input module of the TUT was demonstrated to meet the IOM published specifications.
In addition, the test results show no degradation in discrete input module voltage switching
levels from pre-qualification testing throughout qualification and performance proof testing.
4. Discrete Output Operation – This test shall demonstrate that the maximum current driven
with maximum and minimum voltage of each tested digital output module point shall meet
IOM published specifications.
For all Operability Test runs, each discrete output module of the TUT was demonstrated to
operate ON and OFF at the IOM published specifications for maximum operating current,
and minimum and maximum operating voltage. In addition, the test results show no
degradation in operation of the discrete output modules from pre-qualification testing
throughout qualification and performance proof testing.
5. Timer Function Accuracy – This test shall demonstrate that the measured timer function time
out periods shall not vary by more than ±1 percent or ±3 scan cycles from the baseline timer
time out periods during this test.
The application software timer function accuracy is a function of the scan time of the TSAP
loaded in the TUT. The specified absolute baseline timer function accuracy criteria are not
applicable to testing of the TUT. Therefore, this test was performed to determine the timer
function for the TSAP loaded in the TUT.
For all Operability Test runs, the time out periods of the application program timer functions
were demonstrated to not vary from the measured pre-qualification baseline time-out
periods by more than the greater of ±1 percent of the time out period or three application
program scan cycles. In addition, the test results showed no degradation in timer function
variation from pre-qualification testing throughout qualification and performance proof tests.
6. Failover Performance – This test shall demonstrate that the monitored discrete outputs shall
not change state, the AOs shall not change by more than ±5 percent, and the main
processor shall not reset during the simulated fault test period, and all simulated faults shall
result in actuation of a chassis power supply alarm circuit.
Tests were done to demonstrate automatic failover to redundant components on simulated
failures of a main processor module, an RXM, a chassis expansion port cable, and chassis
power supplies. All test results demonstrated acceptable failover operation of the TUT.
7. Loss of Power Performance / Failure to Complete a Scan Detection – This test shall
demonstrate during the simulated loss of power, the TSAP shall cease operation, all
monitored discrete output points shall open, all monitored AO points shall go to zero, and all
communications with connected test system peripheral devices shall cease. On restoration
of power, the TUT shall pass all start-up hardware diagnostics and shall automatically
resume normal operation.

– 62 –
For all Operability Test runs, performance of the TUT was demonstrated on loss and
restoration of power to the chassis power supplies. The test results demonstrated
predictable and consistent response of the TUT to a loss of power. The test results also
demonstrated predictable and consistent response of the TUT on recovery of power. In
addition, successful restart of the TUT on restoration of power consistently indicated proper
functioning of the watchdog timer mechanisms.
8. Power Interrupt Performance – This test shall demonstrate that the hold-up time for the
chassis power supply modules shall be at least 40 msec on loss of the AC source power
and the monitored discrete outputs shall not change state, the AOs shall not change by
more than ±5 percent, and the main processor shall not reset during the power interrupt
period.
For all Operability Test runs, power hold-up time performance of the TUT chassis power
supplies were demonstrated on an interruption of source power for approximately 40 msec.
The test results demonstrated that the 120 VAC and 230 VAC chassis power supplies meet
the EPRI TR-107330 acceptance criteria for hold-up time capability of at least 40 msec
when installed as the only chassis power supply or when installed in combination with a
second chassis power supply.
9. Power Quality Tolerance – This test shall demonstrate that the output voltage of the TUT
chassis power supply modules shall show no appreciable change in voltage level or DC
ripple content when subjected to the specified source power minimum and maximum
voltage and frequency conditions.
Tests were performed over IOM allowable ranges of voltage and frequency for each type of
power supply included in the testing. All test results demonstrated acceptable performance
of the TUT. In addition, power quality tolerance tests demonstrated acceptable performance
of processor memory writes prior to Tricon reset on gradual loss of source power voltage.
The Prudency Test Procedure, Performance Proof Test was performed following the
successful completion of Operability Test Procedure, Performance Proof Test. Prudency
testing involved exposing the TUT to various normal and abnormal conditions of input/output
operation and source power at minimum source power supply voltage and frequency
conditions. EPRI TR-107330, Section 5.4, describes the specific criteria to be met for
prudency tests.
The Prudency Test Procedure, Performance Proof Test demonstrated that performance
data for the TUT were achieved at minimum source power supply voltage and frequency
conditions under highly dynamic loading and adverse noise conditions in accordance with
IOM published specifications and/or EPRI TR-107330 specifications and all acceptance
criteria stated in the procedure were met with the exception of the failure of the AO module
during burst of events test. This anomaly was evaluated, and IOM concluded that the test
system loopback setup, which was designed for testing purposes, was the cause of the
failure to meet the acceptance criteria. The test system loopback setup is not an installation
arrangement that would be utilized by a customer. The AI module and the AO module will
perform as intended, within the required accuracy, in a customer installation. The test
results of the Prudency Test Procedure, Pre-Qualification Test and Prudency Test
Procedure, Performance Proof Test were analyzed to determine any degradation in the
performance of the TUT. The analyses established that the TUT performed in accordance
with IOM published specifications and/or EPRI TR-107330 specifications before and, after

– 63 –
Qualification Tests and no degradation in the performance of the TUT were identified.
Conclusions from this test are summarized below.
10. Burst of Events Performance – Burst of Events testing demonstrated the ability of the TUT to
process rapidly changing input and output signals based on the control logic of the TSAP
with the exception of the failure of the AO module during burst of events test, as described
above.
11. Communication Port Failure Performance – Communication port failure testing
demonstrated no effect on digital input to digital output, AI to digital output and AO, and
“round-robin” response times during simulated failures of communication lines connected to
communication ports on the TCM. Note that during this test the TUT loop response times
failed to meet the acceptance criteria. IOM found that the failure was due to a DAS threshold
issue. The TUT loop response times passed in the re-run.

PLATFORM INTEGRITY CHARACTERISTICS

SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.5, “System Integrity,” states that a special concern
for digital computer-based systems is confirmation that system real time performance is
adequate to ensure completion of protective actions within the critical time periods identified as
required by Clause 4 of IEEE Std 603-1991. SRP BTP 7-21, “Guidance on Digital Computer
Real-Time Performance,” provides supplemental guidance on evaluating response time for
digital computer-based systems, and discusses design constraints that allow greater confidence
in analyses of results or prototype testing to determine real time performance. In summary, the
integrity of a safety system is evidenced by a predictable response time, which in turn depends
on deterministic behavior and fault management capabilities in addition to the timing
characteristics of the hardware/software system.
3.4.1

RESPONSE TIME

GDC 20, 21, 23, and 25 (of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50) constitute general requirements for
timely operation of the protection features. To meet these requirements, SRP BTP 7-21
provides the following guidance:
•
•

The feasibility of design timing may be demonstrated by allocating a timing budget to
components of the system architecture so that the entire system meets its timing
requirements.
Timing requirements should be satisfied by design commitments.

The regulations that contain the basis for this requirement are in 10 CFR 50.55a(h). In addition,
10 CFR 50.36(c)(1)(ii)(A) requires inclusion of the limiting safety systems settings for nuclear
reactors in the plant technical specifications (TSs), with those settings “so chosen that automatic
protective action will correct the abnormal situation before a safety limit is exceeded.”
Section 4.2.1, Item A, of EPRI TR-107330 states “The overall response time from an input to the
PLC exceeding its trip condition to the resulting outputs being set shall be 100 milliseconds or
less,” and cites conditions related to that time requirement. IOM took exception to the
requirement of Section 4.2.1, Item A of EPRI TR-107330. The NRC staff evaluation of the IOM
exception to the response time requirement can be found in Section 3.3.2 of this SE. On the
basis of the response time values, the Tricon V10 PLC system is not in compliance with
Section 4.2.1-A of EPRI TR-107330. The actual response time for any particular system will

– 64 –
depend upon the actual system configuration and may vary significantly from simple to complex
systems. The determination of the suitability of the Tricon PLC system response time
characteristics for a particular plant application is a plant specific requirement and therefore is
the responsibility of licensees.
The response time performance of a SR system based on the Tricon V10 platform is an ASAI
and subject to plant-specific review to ensure that it satisfies its plant- and application-specific
requirements for system response time presented in the accident analysis in Chapter 15 of the
safety analysis report for the applicant’s plant.
3.4.2

DETERMINISTIC PERFORMANCE

In SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 6.1, “Automatic Control,” the review guidance
identifies considerations for addressing digital computer-based systems in the evaluation of the
automatic control capabilities of safety system command features. Specifically, it is advised that
the evaluation should also confirm that the system’s real-time performance is deterministic and
known. In addition, SRP BTP 7-21 discusses design practices for computer-based systems that
should be avoided. These practices include non-deterministic data communications,
non-deterministic computation, use of interrupts, multitasking, dynamic scheduling, and
event-driven design. The technical position further states that methods for controlling the
associated risk to acceptable real-time performance should be described when such practices
are employed.
EPRI TR-107330 includes requirements intended to achieve deterministic execution cycle
behavior such that an application and its constituent tasks will be completely executed within a
specific time frame. In particular, Section 4.4.1.3, “Program Flow Requirements,” specifies that,
for those PLCs where scanning of the inputs and application program execution are performed
in parallel, the PLC executive must provide methods for assuring that both the input scan and
application program execution are completed each cycle. In effect, the EPRI guide specifies
continuous, essentially non-interruptible, software architecture as the preferred software
environment for safety functions.
The Tricon V10 software architecture has three main elements; ETSX version 6271, the
executive for the application processor, IOCCOM, the executive for the communication
processor and the executive on the various I/O modules. IOM provided a description of the
ETSX version 6271 operating system, documented in Section 2.1.3 of the LTR, which outlines
how the three elements execute and interact. Further details on interrupts, use of watchdog
timers and self-diagnostics used to protect the safety function are outlined in request for
additional information (RAI) 6 response, (Reference 8).
The Tricon PLC system uses a triple redundant architecture to provide fault tolerance and
uninterrupted control in the presence of either hard failures of components or transient faults
from internal or external sources. Sensor signals are received on termination assemblies, which
are constructed as electrically passive circuit boards to which field wiring is attached. The
termination module passes input signals from the field to an input module. Each input module
consists of three identical and independent circuits, all contained on a single printed circuit
assembly. Each of the three input legs asynchronously measures the input signals from the
input termination module and places the values into input tables. Each input table is regularly
interrogated over the I/O bus by the I/O communication processor which is located on the
corresponding main processor module.

– 65 –
As each input module is polled, the appropriate leg of the I/O bus transmits new input data to
the application processor, where it is assembled into a table that is stored in memory for use in
the hardware voting process. The input table in each application processor is transferred to its
neighboring application processors over the Tribus. Hardware voting takes place during this
transfer. The Tribus uses direct memory access to synchronize, transmit, vote, and compare
data among the three application processors. If a disagreement occurs, the signal value found
in two out of three tables prevails, and the third table is corrected accordingly. One time
differences that result from sample timing variations are distinguished from a pattern of differing
data. Each application processor maintains data about necessary corrections in local memory.
Any disparity is flagged and used at the end of the scan by the built in fault analyzer routines of
the Tricon PLC system to determine whether a fault exists on a particular module.
The application processors enter corrected data into the control program, which the application
processor executes in parallel with the neighboring application processors. The control program
generates trip or control signals on the basis of licensee specific application programs. The I/O
communication processor on each 3008N MP module sends the output data to output modules
via the I/O bus. In the event of a trip signal, the output modules use termination assemblies to
transfer the trip signal to the actuation devices.
If an I/O module channel fails to function, an alarm is raised to the MPs. If a redundant module
is installed in the paired slot with the faulty module, and that module is deemed healthy by the
MPs, the system automatically switches over to the standby unit and takes the faulty module off
line. If no standby unit is in place, the faulty module continues to operate on two of the three
legs, and control is unaffected. The user obtains a replacement unit and plugs it into the system
in the paired slot associated with the failed module. (This position is logically paired with the
failed module’s location.) When the MPs detect the presence of a replacement module, they
initiate local health state diagnostics and, if the module is healthy, automatically switch over to
the new module. The user then removes the faulty module for repair or replacement.
If redundant modules are installed and both are deemed healthy by the MPs, the MPs will swap
control between the redundant modules so that each is used on a periodic basis. By
periodically using each module, any faults will be detected and alarmed, and the failed module
will be replaced while a redundant module is in place. This use of redundant modules does not
cause process upsets, and is undetectable outside of the Tricon PLC system.
The NRC staff reviewed specific details pertaining to determinism including the description of
the software in Section 2.1.3 of the LTR, the full description of the three main executive
programs that define a complete scan cycle including interrupts and watchdog timers from the
RAI 6 response (Reference 8), IOM Document No. 9600164-731, “Maximum Response Time
Calculations” (Reference 43), and changes outlined in the IOM Document No. NTX-SER-09-05
(Reference 10) that show there is no change that impacts determinism in the overall
architecture or operation between the V9 and V10 configurations.
The NRC staff determined that the Tricon V10 platform meets the criteria regarding
deterministic performance of SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 6.1, SRP BTP 7-21, and
EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.4.1.3 when appropriately implemented.
3.4.3

DIAGNOSTICS AND SELF-TEST CAPABILITIES

IEEE Std 603-1991 Clause 5.7 states that the safety system shall have the capability for test
and calibration while retaining the capability to accomplish its safety function, and that this

– 66 –
capability be provided during power operation, and shall duplicate, as closely as practicable,
performance of the safety function. Exceptions to testing and calibration during power operation
are allowed where this capability cannot be provided without adversely affecting the safety or
operability of the generating station; however, appropriate justification must be provided;
acceptable reliability of equipment operation must be demonstrated; and the capability shall be
provided while the generating station is shut down. SRP, Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C,
Section 5.7, "Capability for Test and Calibration," provides acceptance criteria for IEEE
Std 603-1991, Clause 5.7. Capability should be provided to permit testing during power
operation and that when this capability can only be achieved by overlapping tests, the test
scheme must be such that the tests do, in fact, overlap from one test segment to another.
Section 5.7 further states that test procedures that require disconnecting wires, installing
jumpers, or other similar modifications of the installed equipment are not acceptable test
procedures for use during power operation. Section 5.7 further states that for digital computer
based systems, test provisions should address the increased potential for subtle system failures
such as data errors and computer lockup.
SRP BTP 7-17, “Guidance on Self-Test and Surveillance Test Provisions,” states that automatic
diagnostics and self-test features should preserve channel independence, maintain system
integrity, and meet the single-failure criterion during testing. Additionally, the benefits of
diagnostics and self-test features should not be compromised by the additional complexity that
may result from their implementation. In particular, the scope and extent of interfaces between
safety software and diagnostic software such as self-test routines should be designed to
minimize the complexity of the integrated software.
EPRI TR-107330 specifies that the PLC platform must provide sufficient diagnostics and test
capability so that a combination of self-diagnostics and surveillance testing will detect all failures
that could prevent the PLC from performing its intended safety function. The range of
conditions for which diagnostics or test capabilities must be provided includes processor stall,
executive program error, application program error, variable memory error, module
communications error, module loss of configuration, excess scan time detection, application not
executing, and field device (e.g., sensor, actuator) degradation or fault. The means of detection
include watchdog timer, checksum for firmware and program integrity, read/write memory tests,
communications monitoring, configuration validation, heartbeat, and self-diagnostics or
surveillance test support features. Both online and power-up diagnostics are specified.
The IOM Planning and Installation Guide, a commercial manual with IOM part number of
9700077-012 (Reference 16), provides detailed descriptions of each diagnostic test and flag.
The Tricon V10 PLC system provides continuous self-testing, including monitoring memory and
memory reference integrity, using watchdog timers, monitoring communication channels,
monitoring central processing unit status, and checking data integrity. The Tricon V10 PLC
system performs self-tests and I/O validation on each module. The Tricon V10 PLC system
TMR architecture provides continuous self-testing to detect, tolerate, and alarm on single
internal failures. The internal self-test functions are transparent to the application program and
are an integral part of the base platform operating software. These diagnostics check each
main processor, as well as each I/O module and communication channel. Transient faults are
recorded and masked by the hardware majority-voting circuit. Persistent faults are diagnosed,
and the faulted module can be replaced or operated in a fault-tolerant manner until replacement
is completed.

– 67 –
System diagnostics monitor the health of each main processor module as well as each I/O
module and communication channel. The main processor modules process diagnostic data
recorded locally and data received from the input module level diagnostics in order to make
decisions about the health of the input modules in the system. All discrepancies are flagged
and used by the built in fault analyzer routine to diagnose faults. The main processor
diagnostics perform the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Verification of fixed-program memory
Verification of the static portion of RAM
Verification of the dual port RAM interface with each IOCCOM
Checking of each IOCCOM’s ROM, dual port RAM access and RS-485 loopback
Verification of the TriTime interface
Verification of the TriBUS interface

All input modules include self-diagnostic features designed to detect single failures within the
module. Fault detection capabilities built into various types of input modules include the
following:
•
•
•
•

The input data from the three legs is compared at the main processor, and persistent
differences generate a diagnostic alarm.
Digital input modules test for a stuck on condition by momentarily driving the input for
one leg low in order to verify proper operation of the signal conditioning circuitry. A
diagnostic alarm is generated if the input module does not respond appropriately.
Analog input modules include high accuracy reference voltage sources which are used
to continuously self-calibrate the analog-to-digital converters. If a converter is found to
be out of tolerance, a diagnostic alarm is generated.
Several input modules also include diagnostics to detect field device failures.

All output modules include self-diagnostic features designed to detect single failures within the
module. The major fault detection capabilities built into output modules include the following:
•
•
•

Digital output modules include output voter diagnostics that toggle the state of one leg at
a time to verify that the output switches are not stuck on or off.
Supervised digital output modules include a voltage and current loopback circuit that
checks for open circuits (e.g., blown fuse) and short circuits in the field wiring.
AO modules include a voltage and current loopback circuit. On these modules, one of
the three legs drives the field load, and the other two legs monitor the loopback current
to verify the module output current is correct.

The NRC staff determined that the Tricon V10 meets the criteria of RG 1.22, RG 1.118, and
IEEE Std 338-1987.
3.5

FAILURE MODES AND EFFECTS ANALYSIS

IOM performed a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) on the Tricon V10 platform, and
documented that analysis in IOM Document No. 9600164-531 (Reference 28). Specifically,
IOM performed the analysis on the system as configured for qualification testing discussed in
Section 3.3 of this report. The FMEA was done in accordance with the guidelines of
Section 6.4.1 of EPRI TR-107330 and IEEE Std 352, Sections 4.1, 4.4, and 4.5.

– 68 –
The FMEA was conducted in a similar manner to the Tricon V9 FMEA, (reference Tricon V9 SE
Section 4.3.1) in that because failure mechanisms that affect a single leg of the triple modular
redundant system generally have no effect on system operation, the FMEA also considered (1)
failure mechanisms that are recognized as being highly unlikely but could affect multiple
components, and (2) the coincident occurrence of otherwise single failures (i.e., multiple
failures).
The NRC staff confirmed through the FMEA that the Tricon V10 is designed to fail to the safe
state. The Tricon V10 is designed for de-energize to trip systems. Input related failures are
designed to set input tables to the de-energized state. Output module voters are designed to
fail to the de-energized state.
The NRC staff confirmed that the Tricon V10 FMEA was performed in accordance with the
guidelines of Section 6.4.1 EPRI TR-107330 and IEEE Std 352, Sections 4.1, 4.4, and 4.5. The
NRC staff determined that the FMEA is sufficiently detailed to provide a useful assessment of
the potential failures and the effects of those failures. The NRC staff also determined that the
Tricon V10 is designed to fail to the safe state. The analysis and results in the Tricon V10
FMEA are suitable for reference by licensees and for incorporation into plant-specific FMEA
analyses.
3.6

RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS

IOM performed a reliability and availability analysis of the Tricon V10 platform as specified in
Section 4.2.3 of EPRI TR-107330 and documented the results in IOM Document
No. 9600164-532, “Reliability / Availability Study for the Tricon V10” (Reference 47).
Calculations were done for periodic test intervals ranging from 6 to 30 months. In all cases, the
calculated reliability and availability were greater than 99.9 percent, which exceeds the
recommended goal of 99.0 percent from the EPRI TR. For a periodic test interval of 18 months
(corresponding to the typical nuclear power plant refueling outage cycle), the reliability is
99.9987 percent and the availability is 99.9990 percent.
The NRC staff reviewed this report and determined that the results of the Tricon V10 reliability
and availability analysis (Reference 47) meet the criteria of EPRI TR-107330, Section 4.2.3.
3.7

COMMUNICATIONS INDEPENDENCE

IEEE Std 603-1991 Clause 5.6, “Independence,” requires independence between (1) redundant
portions of a safety system, (2) safety systems and the effects of design basis events, and (3)
safety systems and other systems. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.6,
“Independence,” provides acceptance criteria for this requirement, and among other guidance,
provides additional acceptance criteria for communications independence. Section 5.6 states
that where data communication exists between different portions of a safety system, the
analysis should confirm that a logical or software malfunction in one portion cannot affect the
safety functions of the redundant portions, and that if a digital computer system used in a safety
system is connected to a digital computer system used in a non-safety system, a logical or
software malfunction of the non-safety system must not be able to affect the functions of the
safety system.
IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003, endorsed by RG 1.152, Revision 2, “Criteria for Use of Computers in
Safety Systems of Nuclear Power Plants,” Clause 5.6, “Independence,” provides guidance on
how IEEE Std 603 requirements can be met by digital systems. This clause of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2

– 69 –
states that, in addition to the requirements of IEEE Std 603-1991, data communication between
safety channels or between safety and non-safety systems shall not inhibit the performance of
the safety function. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.6, “Independence,” provides
acceptance criteria for computer equipment qualification. The regulation at 10 CFR Part 50,
Appendix A, GDC 24, “Separation of protection and control systems,” states that the protection
system be separated from control systems to the extent that failure of any single control system
component or channel, or failure or removal from service of any single protection system
component or channel that is common to the control and protection systems leaves intact a
system satisfying all reliability, redundancy, and independence requirements of the protection
system, and that interconnection of the protection and control systems shall be limited so as to
assure that safety is not significantly impaired. Additional guidance on interdivisional
communications is contained in “Interim Staff Guidance, Digital Instrumentation and Controls,
DI&C-ISG-04, Task Working Group #4, Highly-Integrated Control Rooms Communications
Issues (HICRc).” DI&C-ISG-04 compliance is discussed further in Section 3.7.3.
The NRC staff reviewed the overall design of a Tricon V10 SR system. As part of this review,
the NRC staff evaluated applicability and compliance with SRP Section 7.9, “Data
Communication Systems,” SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.0-A, “Review Process for Digital
Instrumentation and Control Systems,” and SRP BTP 7-11, “Guidance on Application and
Qualification of Isolation Devices.” SRP BTP 7-11 provides guidance for the application and
qualification of isolation devices, and applies to the use of electrical isolation devices to allow
connections between redundant portions of safety systems or between safety and non-safety
systems.
The Tricon V10 supports bi-directional SR and NSR communications. SR communications are
through the TCM using one of two proprietary protocols intended to enhance data integrity. The
P2P protocol, used on the V9 Tricon, is used for SR communications between safety divisions.
The SAP protocol is a new Tricon protocol intended for SR communications within a safety
division. No specific SR communications function was described in the LTR, however, this
capability is included within the scope of the Tricon V10 LTR and therefore, is discussed in
Section 3.7.1 below.
Bidirectional communications used for communications between the SR Tricon V10 platform
and other NSR systems is supported through two separate paths; the TCM and NSR I/O
connected to modules in a remote RXM chassis. NSR to SR Tricon V10 communications are
discussed in Section 3.7.2.
The main element of protection for all Tricon V10 communications is the 3008N Main Processor
Module architecture. The main application processor that runs the control program is data
isolated using a128K shared memory (dual port RAM (DPRAM)). All data used by the control
program is pulled from pre-allocated addresses in the shared memory. Input data is written to
the shared memory by a separate communications processor which controls both the I/O bus
and the communications bus. The overall architecture is the same as the Tricon V9 as
described in Section 2.1.2 of the Tricon V9 SE (Reference 9).
Communications for the Tricon V10 upgrade were evaluated against criteria in the guidance
noted above. The three previously accepted communication modules used in Tricon V9.5.3,
which was not evaluated against DI&C-ISG-04, were replaced by the 4352AN TCM. The NRC
staff chose to first assess the impact of changes to the TCM to understand its capabilities and
limitations. This allowed the NRC staff to apply those findings while evaluating how the system
meets the guidance in DI&C-ISG-04.

3.7.1

COMMUNICATIONS WITH SAFETY CHANNELS/DIVISIONS

Communications between independent safety channels containing Tricon V10 processors is
implemented via the TCM modules. The TCM is a communications device that serves to pass
data between the three redundant communication busses and up to six external channels, two
ethernet, and four RS-485. The TCM was designed under IOM’s Appendix B process and
qualified with the Tricon V10 as a SR device under IOM’s nuclear qualification program
(Reference 59). The TCM software is based on the software used in devices approved with the
Tricon V9.5.3 and adds a new Safety Application Protocol (SAP). The device also uses a
commercial operating system which IOM dedicated using EPRI NP-5652 methods 1, 3 and 4
which is reviewed in Section 3.2.2 of this SE.
Although the TCM uses updated versions of the processor, gatekeeper and transceiver chips,
the architecture is similar to that of the previously approved 4329N Network Communications
Module. A comparison of specifications and system designs showed that the TCM adds
support for the SAP protocol and combines features found in previously approved
communications modules. The NRC staff performed a thread audit on TCM V&V testing during
the December 2010 audit at IOM’s Irvine facility. Based on the review of the LTR (Reference 4),
IOM Document No.NTX-SER-09-05, Sections 4.1 and 4.2 (Reference 10), and the audit results
(Reference 6), the NRC staff concludes that the TCM is functionally equivalent to the previously
approved communication modules.
IOM developed a Communication Application Safety Layer for SR communication between an
external SR processor and the Tricon V10 system. This is an additional layer of protection
provided by the P2P and SAP communication protocols at the application layer of the network
stack. The P2P and SAP protocols are intended to ensure end-to-end integrity of safety-critical
messages between SR processors. These protocols use software at the sending and receiving
processors to provide additional fault mitigations such as message sequencing that are not
accounted for through Ethernet or other parts of the Tricon V10 communication path. System
architectures requiring data transfer between SR Tricons would use the P2P protocol over an
electrically isolated, point-to-point network. Architectures requiring safety-critical data exchange
with SR video display units would utilize the SAP. IOM Document No.NTX-SER-09-10
(Reference 29) describes the Tricon V10 conformance to ISG-04. The NRC staff's evaluation of
the Tricon V10 conformance to ISG-04 is described in Section 3.7.3 of this SE.
All of the protocols except SAP were carried forward unchanged from the Tricon V9. The NRC
staff reviewed the new SAP protocol including the following documents; “Safety Application
Protocol Library Software Requirements Specification,” IOM Document No. 6200260-001
(Reference 60), “Communication Application Safety Layer Interface Requirements
Specification,” IOM Document No. 6200154-099 (Reference 61), “TS1131 Libraries Software
Verification and Validation Plan,” IOM Document No. 9600355-001 (Reference 62), and “SAP
Library Verification and Validation Test Report” (Reference 63). The protocol is implemented at
the application layer which means that it is part of the TriStation 1131 library for Tricon V10.
The documentation confirms testing of the TriStation 1131 library with the SAP protocol.
However, the protocol will also be implemented at the application layer of the connected SR
equipment, presumably a safety video display unit (SVDU). The protocol has not been tested
with any specific external SR devices. Therefore, it is an ASAI to verify that the SAP library is
tested in any proposed application specific SR devices connected to the TCM.
In Document No.NTX-SER-09-05, Section 4.2, IOM states that the TCM software was ported
directly from the V9.5.3 modules. However, the real time operating system was replaced by a

– 71 –
third party real time OS. As reviewed in Section 3.2.2 of this SE, IOM dedicated the third party
pre-developed software (PDS) using EPRI-NP 5652 methods 1, 3, and 4. CGD of the PDS will
only apply for use of the specific product noted in Section 3.2.2. IOM will have to separately
dedicate other versions or products from this vendor. As stated in Section 3.7, the main
element of protection of the safety function with regard to communications is the dual
port/shared memory and the use of a separate communications processor. The P2P and SAP
protocols provide additional data integrity mitigations for all SR communications. The TCM also
provides CRC checks on all incoming data in addition to the protocol mitigations. Finally, the
TCM has an access control capability to control Ethernet communications through IP address.
Read and /or write permission for specific IP addresses can be programmed into an access
control list through the TS 1131 programming software. The NRC staff did not review this
feature with regard to potential cyber security benefits, but does credit it as an additional layer of
secure development and operational environment (SDOE) protection to protect against
inadvertent access in meeting RG 1.152, Revision 3, requirements in Section 3.8 of this SE.
The NRC staff determined that SR communications through the TCM is acceptable for use in
safety systems in nuclear power plants subject to the guidance in DI&C-ISG-04. It is an ASAI to
review any SR communications connections through the TCM with regard to DI&C-ISG-04 as
detailed in Section 3.7.3 of this SE.
3.7.2

COMMUNICATIONS WITH NON-SAFETY SYSTEMS

Communications between SR Tricon V10 systems and NSR equipment are primarily through
the TCM, similar to the SR communications described in Section 3.7.1. However, NSR I/O
connected to a remote RXM chassis must also be considered communication with a non-safety
system because the SR I/O bus crosses the SR/NSR boundary and adequate protection of the
safety function must be demonstrated. Each type of NSR communication is discussed in
Sections 3.7.2.1 and 3.7.2.2 below.
3.7.2.1

NSR COMMUNICATIONS VIA THE TCM MODULES

Section 3.2 of IOM document NTX-SER-09-10, “Compliance with NRC Interim Guidance ISG2
& ISG4,” Revision 2, (Reference 29) describes safety to non-safety communications using the
TCM. There, IOM describes the use of a one way link (OWL) device as a data isolation device
to provide additional protection for NSR communications to a SR Tricon V10 via the TCM.
Specifically, IOM identified NetOptics Aggregator Tap model number PA-CU and cited
precedent based on NRC Safety Evaluation, “Oconee Nuclear Station, Units 1, 2, and 3,
Issuance of Amendments Regarding Acceptance of the Reactor Protective System and
Engineered Safeguard Protective System (RPS/ESPS) Digital Upgrade” (Reference 64).
The NetOptics Port aggregator Tap, Model 96443, No. PA-CU, or PAD-CU, is a device intended
to allow monitoring of a 10/100 BaseT Ethernet communication link by copying the
communications and sending that copied information to a separate one-way communications
link. Port A of the Port Tap is connected to the TCM, and Port B is connected to the
Maintenance Terminal (maintenance video display unit (MVDU)). This allows for two way
10/100 BaseT Ethernet communication between the TCM and the MVDU. Port C of the Port
Tap is attached to an external computer, and this port supports only one-way outbound
communications. In this manner, the TCM can send messages to both the MVDU and an
external computer. As with any Ethernet system, the Maintenance Terminal and the external
computer will read the message headers to determine the intended recipient, and will ignore
messages not addressed to that device.

In addition to the port tap device described above, the same layers of protection that apply to
SR communications would also apply to communications with NSR equipment except that
application layer protocols would not be used. Specifically, listed in order from the TCM back to
the application processor, the mitigations are; TCM IP address discrimination, TCM data
integrity check, IOCCOM single threaded bus master control scheme, IOCCOM data integrity
check, IOCCOM com bus/ I/O bus separation, dual port RAM, fixed addressing in dual port
RAM, read/write specific tag names for memory locations.
The NRC staff determined that NSR equipment (e.g., plant computer) may be connected to the
TCM through a port tap device as described above. This approval is subject to application
specific review items noted above to verify the port tap device meets the precedent criteria
(i.e., verify model number) and to verify port tap configuration in the system. An MVDU may be
connected through the port tap as shown in Figure 3.7.2.1-1. However, approval of the MVDU
will require review of plant specific procedures and review of the plant specific configuration.
It is an ASAI to review all NSR communications connections through the TCM with regard to
DI&C-ISG-04 as detailed in Section 3.7.3 of this SE.
3.7.2.2

NSR COMMUNICATIONS VIA THE REMOTE RXMS

IOM’s Tricon V10 LTR asserted that the safety function is adequately protected when nonsafety I/O is connected to the modules in a remote NSR RXM chassis. A remote NSR RXM
chassis supports expansion of the safety I/O bus from the SR Primary RXMs via fiber optic
cables. Such a connection represents two-way communication (RS-485 on the I/O bus) across
the safety to non-safety barrier and adequate protection of the safety function must be
demonstrated. Specifically, the upstream (closer to the application processor) SR portion of the
I/O bus must be adequately protected from potential faults in the non-safety portion of the I/O
bus. The NRC staff performed a detailed design review of the RXM connectivity within the
Tricon V10 system, which included information in IOM letter dated August 3, 2010,
“Supplementary Information –Selected Topics” (Reference 59, Items 1 and 4), responses to RAI
questions 1 and 2 (Reference 8), and information obtained during the December 2010 audit at
IOM (Reference 6).
As stated in Section 3.1.2.3 of this SE, the RXMs are connected by fiber optic cables and not
electrical cables, and therefore, provide ground loop isolation and immunity against electrostatic
and EMI, and they can be used as Class 1E-to-Non-Class 1E isolators between a SR main
chassis and a NSR expansion chassis. Therefore, the NRC staff finds that the fiber optic cable
between the primary and remote RXMs do provide adequate electrical isolation as required by
the above regulations.
The NRC staff also identified several factors that support adequate data isolation protection of
the safety function including I/O bus access, I/O bus control scheme and the protection of the
safety function of the I/O bus by the interposing processor in the safety side RXM. As
previously stated above, the dual port RAM and independent communications processor
(IOCCOM) provide the primary protection for the safety processor. The IOCCOM verifies data
integrity for all received messages. The I/O bus uses a single threaded master-slave
configuration with IOCCOM as the bus master. The SR I/O bus access for NSR I/O data is
controlled by an interposing processor in the RXM on the SR side such that no unrequested
messages will be allowed onto the SR I/O bus. Further, the redundant Tricon V10 architecture
will mitigate any single failures when the data is voted on the Tribus.

– 74 –
The NRC staff determined that the combination of these elements provided adequate protection
to the safety side I/O bus and the overall safety function. All data received from a non-safety
remote RXM must not be relied upon to perform the required safety function. Further NRC staff
review and approval of this bidirectional NSR to SR data communication is provided below in
Section 3.7.3. It is an ASAI to verify that adequate isolation is maintained in the application
specific design and that no data received from the non-safety I/O is used by the control program
to make a safety determination.
3.7.3

STAFF GUIDANCE IN DI&C-ISG-04

The NRC Task Working Group 4, "Highly Integrated Control Rooms-Communications Issues,"
developed interim NRC Staff Guidance on the review of communications issues applicable to
digital safety systems. DI&C-ISG-04 (Reference 29) contains NRC staff positions on three
areas of interest: (1) Interdivisional Communications, (2) Command Prioritization, and (3)
Multidivisional Control and Display Stations. Evaluation of a safety system against this
guidance is an application-specific activity that requires an assessment of a full system design.
Since the LTR does not address a specific application or establish a definitive safety system
design, the evaluation against this guidance is limited to consideration of the means provided
within the platform to specifically address issues related to interactions among safety divisions
and between SR equipment and equipment that is not SR. A full safety system design, which is
based on the Tricon V10 system, will require further evaluation against this guidance as an
ASAI.
In IOM Document No. NTX-SER-09-10, Revision 2, "Compliance With NRC Interim Guidance
ISG-2 & ISG-4" (Reference 29), IOM provided a position paper to explain how the Tricon V10
system (platform) design complies with the NRC staff guidance provided in DI&C-ISG-04,
Revision 1 - Task Working Group No. 4 “Highly-integrated Control Rooms-Communications
Issues.”
3.7.3.1
DI&C-ISG-04, STAFF POSITION 1 - INTERDIVISIONAL COMMUNICATIONS
Staff Position 1 of DI&C-ISG-04 provides guidance on the review of communications, which
includes transmission of data and information among components in different electrical safety
divisions (or channels) and communications between a safety division and equipment that is not
SR. This ISG does not apply to communications within a single division or channel. This NRC
staff position states that bidirectional communications among safety divisions and between
safety and non-safety equipment may be acceptable provided certain restrictions are enforced
to ensure that there will be no adverse impact on safety systems. It goes on to say that systems
which include communications among safety divisions and/or bidirectional communications
between a safety division and non-safety equipment should adhere to the 20 points described
below. The methods by which the Tricon V10 platform either meets these points or provides an
acceptable alternative method of complying with NRC regulations are discussed below.
3.7.3.1.1 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 1
Staff Position 1, Point 1, states that a safety channel should not be dependent upon any
information or resource originating or residing outside its own safety division to accomplish its
safety function. This is a fundamental consequence of the independence requirements of IEEE
Std 603. It is recognized that division voting logic must receive inputs from multiple safety
divisions.

– 75 –
As described in Section 3.1 of this SE, the Tricon V10 system safety channel is triple redundant
from input terminal to output terminal, as shown in Figure 2-2. The triple modular redundant
(TMR) architecture (i.e., three separate microprocessors) is intended to allow continued system
operation in the presence of any single point of failure within the system. The TMR architecture
is also intended to allow the Tricon V10 main processor (MP) to detect and correct individual
faults on-line, without interruption of monitoring, control, and protection capabilities. In the
presence of a fault, the Tricon V10 channel will alarm the condition, remove the affected portion
of the faulted module from operation, and continue to function normally in a dual redundant
mode. The system returns to the fully triple redundant mode of operation when the affected
module is replaced. Each Tricon TMR-channel monitors dedicated sensors allowing bi-stable
logic within the Tricon V10 to operate completely independent of other Tricon
channels/divisions. As shown in Figure 2-2, the termination panels pass input signals from the
field to an input module or pass signals generated by an output module directly to field wiring.
The Tricon V10 LTR does not propose any interchannel/interdivisional communications or input
from any external systems to perform the Tricon V10 safety function and therefore, each
channel is not dependent upon any information or resource originating from outside its own
safety division.
As described in Section 3.1.2.1 of the SE, the Tricon V10 main chassis has a key switch that
sets the system operating modes between RUN, PROGRAM, STOP, and REMOTE. When the
Tricon V10 platform recognizes that the Tricon main processor is in an operational mode other
than RUN, data can be provided to a safety channel from sources outside the respective
channel (e.g., the TriStation 1131 PC). As described in Section 3.1.3.2 of this SE, plant
procedures and administrative controls will restrict using the System Operating Mode keyswitch
to change from the standard operational mode without placing the affected channel into bypass
or trip.
For configurations involving SR Primary RXM Chassis and non-safety Remote RXM Chassis,
the independence requirements of IEEE Std 603 are satisfied through design characteristics as
well as administrative controls. As stated in Sections 3.1.2.3 and 3.1.2.4 of this SE, non-safety
RXMs can only be configured to communicate with its assigned division/channel. Therefore,
NSR remote RXM chassis and modules are typically considered within a division/channel.
Nonetheless, since a NSR remote RXM module is physically located outside a SR
division/channel Class 1 boundary, its independence from its respective SR RXM is evaluated
below.
As stated in Section 3.7.2.2 of this SE, physical independence is maintained as follows:
The SR Primary RXM Chassis is physically separate from the non-safety Remote RXM
Chassis. Multi-mode fiber optic cables connect the SR 4200 Primary RXM modules to the
non-safety 4201 Remote RXMs. The combination of physically separate chassis as well as
distance between chassis satisfies this criterion.
Electrical independence: The RXM Chassis utilizes dual-redundant power modules, with the
capability to utilize both AC and DC site electrical power sources to the chassis. Each RXM
Chassis is configured with its own pair of redundant power modules, with SR RXM Chassis
powered from site vital electrical power sources, and the non-safety RXM Chassis powered
from non-vital sources. The SR Primary RXM Chassis would have redundant, qualified power
modules. Furthermore, the multi-mode fiber optic cable interconnection between the SR
Primary RXM Chassis and non-safety Remote RXM Chassis provide ground loop isolation and
immunity against electrostatic and EMI. This combination of redundant, separate chassis power

– 76 –
modules, site electrical sources, and RXM Chassis interconnection with fiber-optic cables meets
the requirements for electrical independence.
Data communications independence: The SR Primary RXM 4200 modules provide a
gatekeeper function to ensure communication failures on the non-safety Remote RXM do not
propagate to the SR portion of the I/O bus. The master-slave CPUs on SR Primary RXMs
monitor data messages and enable data transfer to and from the non-safety RXMs only for valid
command messages to the downstream non-safety I/O modules. Another layer of protection is
provided to ensure data communication independence by the embedded IOCCOM processor on
the SR 3008N MP. During a command-response sequence between the IOCCOM and a
non-safety I/O module the IOCCOM checks for erroneous (including invalid and unexpected)
and corrupted messages, and will time-out the sequence when a packet is delayed and/or
missing. The combination of the IOCCOM and the gatekeeper function in the SR Primary
RXMs meet the requirements for communications isolation.
As a result of this review and the operational conditions noted above, the NRC staff determined
that the Tricon V10 platform system complies with the guidance provided by Staff Position 1,
Point 1. However, if a plant application of the Tricon V10 system invokes interchannel
communications, then the specific interconnections defined for the plant-specific safety
application must be determined and evaluated in a plant-specific review.
3.7.3.1.2 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 2
Staff Position 1, Point 2, states that the safety function of each safety channel should be
protected from adverse influence from outside the division of which that channel is a member.
Information and signals originating outside the division must not be able to inhibit or delay the
safety function. This protection must be implemented within the affected division (rather than in
the sources outside the division), and must not itself be affected by any condition or information
from outside the affected division. This protection must be sustained despite any operation,
malfunction, design error, communication error, or software error or corruption existing or
originating outside the division.
Communications pathways to a safety channel (or division) have the highest potential to
produce adverse influences to a safety channel from a safety division (or channel), which is
outside the division. As shown in Figure 3.7.3.1.2-1 below, multiple layers of defense are
designed into the Tricon V10 system, including the hardware, the software, and the IOM
communication protocols themselves.

– 77 –

Figure 3.7.3.1.2-1 – Tricon V10 Communication Pathways
The communication path into a Tricon V10 safety channel includes the multi-mode fiber optic
cable, the TCM, the triplicated Communication Bus (COMBUS), and the TMR 3008N MPs,
which themselves contain the IOCCOM processor, dual-port RAM (DPRAM), and the
embedded application processor that executes the control program. The TCM provides
functional isolation by handling all the communications with external devices, and it has been
qualified under the IOM Appendix B program for nuclear applications. The fiber optic cable
prevents propagation of electrical faults into the safety processors. In addition, the TCM has
been designed for high-reliability and contributes to the overall reliability of the communication
link through the use of CRCs, and testing has demonstrated that it will protect the safety core
from network storms and other communication failures. Upon total loss of all TCMs, the safety
core will continue to function and execute the application program. Furthermore, the Tricon V10
system has been tested by Wurldtech and it has been shown to be resilient against the
communication faults.
The COMBUS is a triplicated, internal communications bus utilizing a master-slave protocol with
the TCM configured as the slave. The IOCCOM uses a CRC for integrity checks of COMBUS
data. Each MP module contains an IOCCOM processor to handle the data exchange between
the embedded application processor and either the I/O modules or the TCM. The IOCCOM
processor is scan based, and does not use interrupts. IOCCOM maintains separation for I/O
bus and COM message processing, applying checks on both the link-level formatting and
CRCs. To ensure adequate execution time for SR I/O, the IOCCOM executes COM messages
only while waiting for I/O responses. The application processor and IOCCOM exchange data
through the DPRAM buffering system. The application safety processor has higher priority, but
the design guarantees that the interface is shared – neither processor can starve the other
processor accessing the DPRAM. The application processor assigns highest priority to
executing the safety function, and messaging is rate-limited. In addition, the three safety 3008N
MPs first vote on the message before acting on any message from the TCM.
Another layer of protection to the safety function (processor) is provided by the communication
protocols at the Application Layer of the OSI protocol stack. For all communication links
between SR equipment, the P2P and SAP protocols ensure end-to-end integrity of safety-critical
messages, and thus do not rely upon the TCM(s) or IOCCOM for message integrity. System
architectures requiring data transfer between SR Tricon V10 platforms over a network would

– 78 –
use the P2P protocol over an isolated, point-to-point network. Architectures requiring
safety-critical data exchanges with other SR devices (e.g., SR VDUs) would utilize the SAP
protocol. Both protocols have been developed in accordance with the IOM Quality Assurance
program and approved for use in nuclear SR applications (see Section 3.7.1 of this SE).
Certain data integrity features are built into the protocols, such as message acknowledgement
and negative acknowledgement (ACK/NAK).
The non-safety TriStation 1131 computer will be used to reprogram the application program
installed on the Tricon controller(s). During these activities the Tricon is taken out of service
with site administrative procedures and by taking the Tricon keyswitch out of the RUN mode.
The Tricon keyswitch is a physical interlock that controls the mode of the MPs. It prevents the
TCM from accepting “write” messages when placed in the RUN position. The position of the
keyswitch is continuously monitored by the TMR MPs, with the MPs voting on the detected
position of the keyswitch. The Tricon is designed so that an application program output can be
provided to activate an annunciator window in the control room when the keyswitch is not in the
RUN position. Furthermore, as described in Section 3.1.3.2 of this SE, plant procedures, and
administrative controls will restrict using the System Operating Mode keyswitch to change from
the standard operational mode without placing the affected channel into bypass or trip. The
TriStation 1131 cannot modify firmware in the Tricon controllers. A separate tool is used to
perform firmware upgrades with the Tricon module (e.g., 3008N MP, TCM, I/O module)
removed from the chassis. The Tricon controller would have to be taken out of service
(keyswitch to STOP) and the module removed from the chassis. These activities would be
under site-specific administrative controls and performed in accordance with site-specific
procedures.
For configurations involving SR Primary RXM Chassis and non-safety Remote RXM Chassis,
Point 2 is satisfied through design characteristics of the Tricon V10 system. As stated in
Sections 3.1.2.3 and 3.1.2.4 of this SE, non-safety RXMs can only be configured to
communicate with its assigned division/channel. Therefore, NSR remote RXM chassis and
modules are typically considered within a division/channel. Nonetheless, since a NSR remote
RXM is physically located outside a SR division/channel Class 1 boundary, then the safety
function of each safety channel should be protected from adverse influence from NSR RXMs
associated with a division/channel.
As described in Point 1 above, physical and electrical separation is inherent in the design of the
RXM Chassis. As described in Section 3.1.2.4 of this SE, the purpose of the remote RXM
Chassis is to extend the Tricon V10 system I/O bus to locations at distances farther than the
standard 9000-series copper cables can handle. Therefore, a non-safety Remote RXM Chassis
would be physically separated from the SR Main and Primary RXM Chassis.
As described in the Tricon V10 LTR, the design of the Tricon V10 system RXM's does not allow
data exchange between RXM Chassis in different safety divisions or channels. Hence, the
Tricon V10 system is not dependent upon data from other safety divisions/channels. Deviations
from this design would be a plant-specific configuration that would warrant further NRC review
to verify compliance with this Point.
The Primary RXM gatekeeper function (the master CPU) protects the SR segment of the I/O
Bus from invalid or erroneous data from the NSR RXMs. The master-slave CPUs on SR
Primary RXMs monitor data messages and enable data transfer to and from the non-safety
RXMs only for valid command messages to the downstream non-safety I/O modules.

– 79 –
Another layer of protection is provided by the embedded IOCCOM processor on the SR 3008N
MP module during a valid command-response sequence between the IOCCOM and a
non-safety I/O module. The IOCCOM checks for erroneous (including invalid and unexpected)
and corrupted messages, and will time-out the sequence when a packet is delayed and/or
missing. The combination of the IOCCOM in the safety main processor (3008N) and the
gatekeeper function in the SR Primary RXMs meet the requirements for protection of the safety
processor despite any operation, malfunction, design error, communication error, or software
error or corruption existing or originating outside the division.
As a result of this review and the design and operational conditions noted above, the NRC staff
determined that the Tricon V10 safety system provides protection of the safety function and
complies with the guidance provided by Staff Position 1, Point 2.
3.7.3.1.3 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 3
Staff Position 1, Point 3, states that a safety channel should not receive any communication
from outside its own safety division unless that communication supports or enhances the
performance of the safety function. Receipt of information that does not support or enhance the
safety function would involve the performance of functions that are not directly related to the
safety function. Safety systems should be as simple as possible. Functions not necessary for
safety, even if they enhance reliability, should be executed outside the safety system. A safety
system designed to perform functions not directly related to the safety function would be more
complex than a system that performs the same safety function, but is not designed to perform
other functions. The more complex system would increase the likelihood of failures and
software errors. Such a complex design, therefore, should be avoided within the safety system.
For example, comparison of readings from sensors in different divisions may provide useful
information concerning the behavior of the sensors (for example, On-Line Monitoring). Such a
function executed within a safety system, however, could also result in unacceptable influence
of one division over another, or could involve functions not directly related to the safety
functions, and should not be executed within the safety system. Receipt of information from
outside the division, and the performance of functions not directly related to the safety function,
if used, should be justified. It should be demonstrated that the added system/software
complexity associated with the performance of functions not directly related to the safety
function and with the receipt of information in support of those functions does not significantly
increase the likelihood of software specification or coding errors, including errors that would
affect more than one division. The applicant should justify the definition of “significantly” used in
the demonstration.
The design features of the Tricon V10 system as described in the LTR do not include any
communications from outside a single channel (i.e., platform) that does not support the safety
function. Each Tricon TMR-channel monitors dedicated sensors allowing bistable logic within
the Tricon V10 to operate completely independent of other Tricon-channels/divisions. The
termination panels pass input signals from the field to an input module or pass signals
generated by an output module directly to field wiring. Consequently, the Tricon V10 platform is
not overly complex and not subject to failures induced by complexity. The Tricon V10 system
does include diagnostic and self-testing features which are built into the platform. However,
these features are not dependent upon external inputs, and contribute to the Tricon V10
reliability and availability.
As a result of this review and the Tricon V10 platform design features noted above, the NRC
staff determined that the Tricon V10 safety system complies with the guidance provided by Staff

– 80 –
Position 1, Point 3. However, the Tricon V10 system does provide allowances for potential
connections between SR Tricon controllers using the P2P protocol, between a SR Tricon
controller(s) and a SVDU(s) using the Safety Application Protocol (SAP), or between SR Tricon
controllers and non-safety devices (MVDUs, non-safety Tricon controllers, etc.) using a One
Way Link (OWL) device as discussed in Sections 3.7.1 and 3.7.2.1 of this SE. Although the
P2P and SAP communication protocols have been approved (see Section 3.7.1) for SR
application, interdivisional communications between SR Tricon V10 controllers using the P2P,
SAP, or communications between SR Tricon V10 controllers and non-safety systems using
other protocols would require plant specific analysis to verify compliance with this staff position.
3.7.3.1.4 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 4
Staff Position 1, Point 4, states that the communication process itself should be carried out by a
communications processor separate from the processor that executes the safety function, so
that communications errors and malfunctions will not interfere with the execution of the safety
function. The communication and function processors should operate asynchronously, sharing
information only by means of dual-ported memory or some other shared memory resource that
is dedicated exclusively to this exchange of information. The function processor, the
communications processor, and the shared memory, along with all supporting circuits and
software, are all considered to be SR, and must be designed, qualified, fabricated, etc., in
accordance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendices A and B. Access to the shared memory should
be controlled in such a manner that the function processor has priority access to the shared
memory to complete the safety function in a deterministic manner. For example, if the
communication processor is accessing the shared memory at a time when the function
processor needs to access it, the function processor should gain access within a timeframe that
does not impact the loop cycle time assumed in the plant safety analyses. If the shared
memory cannot support unrestricted simultaneous access by both processors, then the access
controls should be configured such that the function processor always has precedence. The
safety function circuits and program logic should ensure the safety function will be performed
within the timeframe established in the safety analysis, and will be completed successfully
without data from the shared memory in the event that the function processor is unable to gain
access to the shared memory.
As described in the Triconex Topical Report (Reference 4), all Tricon communication with
external devices is conducted and supervised by one or more separate TCMs, which are
contained within the Tricon V10 Main Chassis (channel). The TCMs operate asynchronously,
sharing information only at end of the application processor scan. When the external device
requests data, the communication processor forwards the data from the application processor
received at the previous end of scan. When an external device transmits data to the Tricon V10
safety application processor, the communication processor passes the data to the application
processor at next end of scan exchange. A simplified view of the Tricon communications
system is shown in the Figure 3.7.3.1.4-1 below.

– 81 –

Figure 3.7.3.1.4-1 – Tricon V10 Communications
The TCM provides functional isolation by handling all the communications with external devices
that may be connected to other divisions, and it has been qualified under the IOM Appendix B
program for nuclear applications. A fiber optic cable is used between the TCM and external
devices to prevent propagation of electrical faults into the safety processors. In addition, the
TCM has been designed for high reliability and contributes to the overall reliability of the
communication link through the use of Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs). Testing has
demonstrated that the TCM will protect the safety core from network storms and other
communication failures (see Staff Position 1, Point 12). Upon total loss of all TCMs, the safety
core will continue to function.
The internal communication path for external devices to and from the Tricon V10 platform is via
the TCM, to the triplicated Communication Bus (COMBUS), and the TMR 3008N MPs (all are
safety related and contained within the SR Main Chassis). The MPs contain the IOCCOM
processor, dual-port RAM (DPRAM), and the embedded application processors that execute the
safety control program. Valid messages received by the TCM are triplicated for transmission on
the COMBUS and then to the IOCCOM, which is running at its own scan rate without the use of
interrupts. The IOCCOM processor retrieves data from the DPRAM to send to either the I/O
modules or the TCM, or deposits I/O data or communications (COM) messages into the

– 82 –
DPRAM for use by the application processor. Separate queues are provided in the IOCCOM for
I/O Bus and COM messages. To ensure adequate execution time for SR I/O, the IOCCOM
executes COM messages from the TCM only while waiting for I/O responses. The IOCCOM
checks the link-level format and the CRC of all messages from the TCM. If the IOCCOM
determines that the message is valid and correct, the data is placed into DPRAM.
Both the application processor and IOCCOM exchange data through the DPRAM. The
application processor has higher priority, but the design is such that the interface is equally
shared (i.e., neither processor can starve the other processor accessing the DPRAM). As with
the IOCCOM, the DPRAM provides separate memory areas and queues for communication
messages and I/O data. These “bins” are separated according to input, output, read-only,
read-write, and data type (i.e., Boolean, Reals, Integers). The DPRAM includes extensive
memory protection via parity checks, CRCs, checksum, and other mechanisms.
As stated previously, the application processor assigns highest priority to executing the safety
function, and messaging is rate-limited. The three 3008N MPs vote on the message before
acting on any message from the TCM. Conversely, the TCM votes on the messages from the
three 3008N MPs and sends a single copy to an external device if two out of three messages
agree.
The embedded application processor, IOCCOM, and TCM each runs its own scan loop (see
Figure 2-6 in Section 3.1.3.1 of this SE). The embedded application processor and IOCCOM
are synchronized to facilitate exchange of data through the DPRAM. The main scan loop
(“ETSX”) of the embedded application processor consists of three tasks:
1) Scan Task,
2) Communication Task, and
3) Background Task.
The Scan Task sequence is essentially:
Input data from DPRAM and vote → Process control program → Send outputs to DPRAM.
The Communication Task is run after the Scan Task during the “Scan Surplus” period. The
embedded application processor and the IOCCOM scan loops are synchronized such that
during the Communication Task the IOCCOM deposits I/O and communications messages into
the DPRAM for use by the embedded application processor at the beginning of the next Scan
Task. The IOCCOM scan loop (“IOC loop”) gives priority to I/O data exchanges. During the
IOC loop when the IOCCOM is waiting for responses from the I/O modules, scan time is allotted
for COM messaging via the COMBUS.
As described in Sections 3.1.2.4 and 3.7.1.2 of this SE, another means of communications
within a channel or division is via the remote RXMs. Communications data via the remote
RXMs can be either SR or NSR data. NTX-SER-09-10, Section 2, “V10 Tricon Chassis
Configurations,” and Section 3.2, “V10 Tricon Communications – Safety-to-Non-safety
Communications,” propose safety-to-non-safety Tricon V10 architectures utilizing non-safety
Remote Extender Chassis. Communications via the RXMs is accomplished as follows: The
primary RXMs are qualified as Class 1E equipment. The remote RXMs are also qualified as
Class 1E equipment, but may be used to transmit non-safety data to the primary RXMs and
therefore must be evaluated as NSR equipment. Although the remote RXMs are qualified
equipment, the connection of non-safety related I/O or use of non-1E power forces a NSR

– 83 –
designation for the entire remote chassis. The following paragraphs describe how the Tricon
V10 works to provide adequate protection between a SR primary RXM and a remote RXM in a
NSR chassis.
The SR primary RXM contains two on-board microprocessors (CPUs) in a master-slave
configuration. The master CPU monitors all messages coming from, and is directly polled by,
the SR 3008N MP. The master CPU is responsible for the on-board diagnostics. It monitors
the I/O bus for messages intended for the remote RXM in the NSR chassis, and provides the
required responses. The slave CPU monitors all messages coming from the I/O modules
(i.e., response messages from the remote RXMs). The slave CPU provides updated
information to the master CPU regarding active I/O modules in its downstream path (e.g., in the
non-safety RXM Chassis). Any errors the slave CPU detects are also passed to the master
CPU. Together the master and slave CPUs enable/disable the communication multiplexer on
the RXMs.
In normal mode, whenever the master CPU detects that the chassis number embedded in a
valid command from the SR 3008N MP is addressed to an I/O module in its downstream leg, it
will enable the communication multiplexer. Otherwise, it will be disabled. Therefore, noise and
erroneous messages received by the SR Primary RXM while the communication multiplexer is
disabled will not be passed to the SR IOCCOM on the SR 3008N MP. Consequently, the
normal operation of the SR 3008N MP is protected from faults and/or noise from the non-safety
Remote RXM and non-safety I/O modules. The I/O Bus is composed of separate command and
response buses, which are fiber optic cables that are used between the SR primary RXM and
NSR Remote RXMs to prevent propagation of electrical faults into the safety processors.
Commands from the SR IOCCOM on the SR 3008N MP are sent over a separate path than the
responses from the I/O modules. This separation of commands and responses at the hardware
level ensures that I/O modules (I/O Bus slaves) respond only to valid commands from the
IOCCOM via the SR Primary RXM.
The internal communication path for the primary RXM to and from the Tricon V10 safety
function processor is via the triplicated I/O bus, then to the IOCCOM processor, and then to the
DPRAM. As described for the TCM processors, communications between the safety function
processor and the IOCOOM is via the DPRAM.
The NRC staff has reviewed the design and functionality of the communications process and
the hardware and software used to implement this process, and has determined that the Tricon
V10 system complies with Staff Position 1, Point 4.
3.7.3.1.5 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 5
Staff Position 1, Point 5, states that the cycle time for the safety function processor should be
determined in consideration of the longest possible completion time for each access to the
shared memory. This longest-possible completion time should include the response time of the
memory itself and of the circuits associated with it, and should also include the longest possible
delay in access to the memory by the function processor assuming worst-case conditions for the
transfer of access from the communications processor to the function processor. Failure of the
system to meet the limiting cycle time should be detected and alarmed.
Staff Position 1, Point 4, and Section 3.1.3.1 of this SE describe the scan loop for the Tricon
V10 controller. To summarize, the TMR 3008N MPs and TCM exchange messages
asynchronously over the triplicated COMBUS. On board each 3008N MP, the embedded

– 84 –
application processor and IOCCOM processor exchange data via a DPRAM. The application
processor has higher priority for accessing the DPRAM. Data is deposited into DPRAM at the
end of the embedded application processor Scan Task, which the IOCCOM processor retrieves
during its own scan loop (synchronized with the embedded application processor scan loop).
During surplus scan time, the Communication Task is run and the embedded application
processor retrieves messages from the DPRAM in preparation for the next Scan Task. Priority
is given to the application program and I/O data exchanges, with communication message
exchanges with the TCM via the COMBUS occurring between scans.
As described in the IOM ISG-04 Position Paper (Reference 29) all data is exchanged at each
End-of-Scan, therefore, communication message exchanges may require multiple scans to
satisfy a host device (such as a Tricon, SVDU, or other device on the DCS) read or write
communication function. Additional time (at least two scan loops) is required for a sending
Tricon controller to get an acknowledgment from the receiving Tricon controller that the
message has been received and processed. In fact, most messages from an external system
require voting by the TMR 3008N MPs. Thus, typical message response times require three or
more scans to complete – one scan to send and two scans for the response.
The IOM protocols used for safety-critical communications, P2P and SAP, are discussed in Staff
Position 1, Points 1 and 2 above. The SAP and P2P protocols are responsible for the
end-to-end integrity of safety-critical communications, and thus will be implemented during
plant-specific application software development. Because of the additional functions these
protocols specify at the Application Layer to protect communications, P2P and SAP will place a
burden on the application processor and therefore extend the Tricon controller cycle time.
The Tricon V10 platform continuously monitors system functionality and performance, activating
an alarm should scan time exceed the predicted performance. IOM Document
No. 9600164-731 (Reference 43), “Maximum Response Time Calculation,” provides formulas to
estimate the maximum response time for the various I/O module types. Application specific
safety systems using the Tricon V10 platform will utilize the formulas and built-in features in the
development of the SR application program. Also, thorough program operational testing will
need to be conducted to determine the longest scan-time duration. The cycle times resulting
from all these data processing activities will need to be calculated and compared to a plant's
safety analysis to ensure safety-critical timing requirements are met. The Tricon V10 LTR did
not provide a specific cycle time for the platform itself. In light of this evaluation, Staff
Position 1, Point 5, cannot be assessed for the Tricon V10 platform and must be evaluated as
an application specific review for a plant specific application.
3.7.3.1.6 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 6
Staff Position 1, Point 6, states that the safety function processor should perform no
communication handshaking and should not accept interrupts from outside its own safety
division.
For the Tricon V10 controller, the 3008N MP acts as the safety function processor in a
Triple-Modular-Redundant configuration. Staff Position 1, Point 1, explains that Tricon V10
controllers are qualified TMR systems and are not dependent upon interdivisional
communications or external systems to perform the safety function. This includes interrupts
from external systems. The TMR 3008N MP application processors are isolated from data
communications by the TCM. One or more TCM(s) act as the communication processor(s) to
handle all communication protocol requirements (i.e., handshaking, start, stop bits). Also, the

– 85 –
TMR 3008N MP application processors are isolated from non-safety I/O data communications
by the combination of the DPRAM, the IOCCOM, and the SR Primary RXM. There is no
handshaking on the I/O bus.
The NRC staff review of the communications protocols associated with the communications
used by the Tricon V10 platform does use communications handshaking, but this handshaking
is done by the TCM communications modules. However, the safety function processor
contained within the TRM 3008N MP communicates externally using only the dual-ported
memory, and this process does not use handshaking or interrupts as described in
Sections 3.1.2.7 and 3.7.1 of this SE. The NRC staff has reviewed the use of communications
handshaking, and has determined that since all handshaking during system operations is done
by the communications processor, and not by the safety function processor, the Tricon V10
platform complies with Staff Position 1, Point 6.
3.7.3.1.7 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 7
Staff Position 1, Point 7, states that only predefined data sets should be used by the receiving
system. Unrecognized messages and data should be identified and dispositioned by the
receiving system in accordance with the pre-specified design requirements. Data from
unrecognized messages must not be used within the safety logic executed by the safety
function processor. Message format and protocol should be pre-determined. Every message
should have the same message field structure and sequence, including message identification,
status information, and data bits, in the same locations in every message. Every datum should
be included in every transmit cycle, regardless of whether it has changed since the previous
transmission, to ensure deterministic system behavior.
All communications with external devices including remote RXMs are limited to
Tricon-compatible protocols, as described in Section 3.0, of the Tricon V10 Compliance with
ISG-02 & 04 document. Each protocol is well-defined and ordered, i.e. number of start and stop
bits, timing, data frame format, number of data fields and check sum or Cyclic Redundancy
Check (CRC) field. Should an error occur, the communication processor rejects the message.
The message length may vary, however, as an external device may request a different number
of data points within each request.
Extensive testing was performed by an independent third-party (Wurldtech) to validate the
robustness of the Tricon V10 against communication failures. The Tricon V10 passed tests to
verify the robustness of the TCM to various communication failures, such as proper handling of
rogue and invalid protocol packets, and continued operation under network storm conditions
without adverse impact on the TMR 3008N MP control algorithm. Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP,
TCP, and UDP protocols were tested. The test configuration included monitoring of digital
output signals to confirm that the Tricon application program running on the TMR 3008N MPs
was unperturbed. Testing validated that the TCM will discard rogue, invalid, and excessive
Ethernet packets (such as during data storms), thereby ensuring the operation of the TMR
3008N MPs was unperturbed during communication failures.
Communication between the 3008N MP and the remote RXMs via an I/O module uses a serial,
asynchronous, RS485 master-slave protocol at 375 Kbps. The format of I/O message
commands is fixed. The master and slave CPU's on the RXM ensure the messages are
properly formatted and are valid command messages (e.g., chassis number, leg number, and
slot number, correct CRC) so that there is an expected corresponding response message for
every command message. Also, the IOCCOM processor performs a validity check before

– 86 –
processing the response message (i.e., forwarding the I/O response data to the DPRAM on the
3008N MP for the embedded application processor to retrieve). Corrupted and improperly
addressed messages will be ignored by the IOCCOM and I/O modules.
Based on this information, the NRC staff has determined that the Tricon V10 platform complies
with Staff Position 1, Point 7.
3.7.3.1.8 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 8
Staff Position 1, Point 8, states that data exchanged between redundant safety divisions or
between safety and non-safety divisions should be processed in a manner that does not
adversely affect the safety function of the sending divisions, the receiving divisions, or any other
independent divisions.
As described above in Sections 3.7.1, 3.7.2, and Staff Position 1, Point 2, above for data
exchanged between redundant safety divisions and for data exchanged between safety and
non-safety portions of the Tricon V10 platform, all data exchanges are done using an
interposing communications processor, and the safety function processor processes this data
as part of the standard software loop. The Tricon V10 LTR indicates that there will be no data
exchange between RXM Chassis in different safety divisions or trains. For this reason, the NRC
staff has determined that the data exchange within the Tricon V10 platform complies with Staff
Position 1, Point 8.
3.7.3.1.9 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 9
Staff Position 1, Point 9, states that incoming message data should be stored in fixed
predetermined locations in the shared memory and in the memory associated with the function
processor. These memory locations should not be used for any other purpose. The memory
locations should be allocated such that input data and output data are segregated from each
other in separate memory devices or in separate pre-specified physical areas within a memory
device.
As described in Staff Position 1, Point 4, the internal communication path for external devices to
and from the Tricon V10 platform is via the TCM and/or RXMs, to the triplicated Communication
Bus (COMBUS) and/or I/O bus, and to the TMR 3008N MPs (all are safety related and
contained within the SR Main Chassis). The SR 3008N MP contains an application processor,
DPRAM, and IOCCOM processor. The application processor executes the SR application
program. The IOCCOM handles interactions with the TCM via the COMBUS and the I/O
subsystem via the I/O Bus, utilizing dedicated memory locations for communications and I/O
data. All communications between the safety function processor and the IOCCOM and/or the
RXMs are via the DPRAM. Data received by the Tricon V10 is stored in fixed "aliased" memory
locations (an alias is a unique identifying integer value, which is automatically assigned by the
TriStation 1131 application programming tool to input, output, and system variables), which are
utilized by the application processor when computing application logic. Input data is segregated
from output data within memory. The DPRAM provides separate memory areas and queues for
communication messages and I/O data. The communications processor uses physically
different areas (or bins) of the DPRAM for receiving and sending data. The memory locations
used for each message is determined at the time of program compilation. The DPRAM includes
extensive memory protection via parity checks, CRCs, checksum, and other mechanisms. For
these reasons, the NRC staff has determined that the dual-ported memory usage, in terms of

– 87 –
separate areas for input and output data and for fixed memory usage within the Tricon V10
platform complies with Staff Position 1, Point 9.
3.7.3.1.10 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 10
Staff Position 1, Point 10, states that safety division software should be protected from alteration
while the safety division is in operation. On-line changes to safety system software should be
prevented by hardwired interlocks or by physical disconnection of maintenance and monitoring
equipment. A workstation (e.g., engineer or programmer station) may alter addressable
constants, setpoints, parameters, and other settings associated with a safety function only by
way of the dual-processor/shared-memory scheme described in this guidance, or when the
associated channel is inoperable. Such a workstation should be physically restricted from
making changes in more than one division at a time. The restriction should be by means of
physical cable disconnect, or by means of keylock switch that either physically opens the data
transmission circuit or interrupts the connection by means of hardwired logic. “Hardwired logic”
as used here refers to circuitry that physically interrupts the flow of information, such as an
electronic AND gate circuit (that does not use software or firmware) with one input controlled by
the hardware switch and the other connected to the information source: the information
appears at the output of the gate only when the switch is in a position that applies a “TRUE” or
“1” at the input to which it is connected. Provisions that rely on software to effect the
disconnection are not acceptable. It is noted that software may be used in the safety system or
in the workstation to accommodate the effects of the open circuit or for status logging or other
purposes.
A non-safety computer is used to upgrade module firmware and/or reprogram the application
program installed on the Tricon V10 controller(s). During these activities the Tricon is taken out
of service with site administrative procedures and by taking the Tricon keyswitch out of the RUN
mode. The Tricon keyswitch is a physical interlock that controls the mode of the 3008N MPs. It
prevents the 3008N MPs from accepting “write” messages when placed in the RUN position.
This keyswitch is described in Section 3.3.1.3 of IOM Document No. NTX-SER-10-14, “Tricon
V10 Conformance to Regulatory Guide 1.152” (Reference 35). It describes the physical
protection of the embedded firmware and the process that must be followed to update the
software. The keyswitch is implemented by a three-gang, four-position switch. Each of the
gangs is connected to one of the 3008N MPs. The values are read by each of the 3008N MPs
as a two bit software value. The position of the keyswitch is continuously monitored by the TMR
MPs, with the MPs voting on the detected position of the keyswitch. The Tricon is designed so
that an application program output can be provided to activate an annunciator window in the
control room when the Tricon keyswitch is not in the RUN position. The application program
has access to the voted keyswitch position through specialized function blocks. These
specialized function blocks allow monitoring (i.e., read-only capability) of a system variable for
the voted keyswitch position. The application can be programmed to perform any required
action on a change of the keyswitch position. However, this would be an application specific
feature that is beyond the scope of this review. During firmware updates of the Tricon
controllers the Tricon module (e.g., 3008N MP, TCM, I/O module) is removed from the chassis.
The Tricon controller would have to be taken out of service (keyswitch to STOP) and the module
removed from the chassis. These activities would be under site-specific administrative controls
and performed in accordance with site-specific procedures.
The keyswitch design mitigates against any single hardware fault. If one of the gangs on the
switch goes bad or an input to a 3008N MP fails (e.g., a single bit flip), the error would affect
only the 3008N MP that is attached to the failed gang. The other two 3008N MPs would

– 88 –
continue to receive good inputs values and out vote the 3008N MP with the bad input. This
protects against any single fault in the physical keyswitch or on the 3008N MP. Section 3.1.2 of
this SE discusses other administrative control options that may be invoked to ensure on-line
changes to safety system software are prevented.
The I/O subsystem, which includes the RXM Chassis, cannot be modified during run time.
There is no interface with the operator or TriSation 1131 user that would allow modification of
the RXM firmware during run time. Modification or update of RXM firmware requires 1) removal
of the RXM from the RXM Chassis, and 2) special tools to interface directly with the single RXM;
IOM neither provides nor sells these tools to its customers.
However, the Tricon V10 keyswitch does not provide a physical disconnect or interruption of the
connection by means of hardwired logic as required by ISG 4, Staff Position 1, Point 10, but
instead sets 2 bits within the software to change the operating mode of the Tricon. Therefore,
the Tricon V10 relies on software to effect the disconnection of the TriStation capability to
modify the safety system software, a condition specifically stated as not acceptable in this ISG
staff position. Based on the information provided in the LTR, the NRC staff determined that the
Tricon V10 platform does not meet the NRC staff guidance provided in Staff Position 1,
Point 10.
In order for the NRC staff to accept this keyswitch function as compliant with this Staff Position,
the NRC staff will have to evaluate an application specific system communications control
configuration--including the operation of the keyswitch, the software affected by the keyswitch,
and any testing performed on failures of the hardware and software associated with the
keyswitch. This is an ASAI associated with the implementation of this keyswitch.
3.7.3.1.11 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 11
Staff Position 1, Point 11, states that provisions for interdivisional communication should
explicitly preclude the ability to send software instructions to a safety function processor unless
all safety functions associated with that processor are either bypassed or otherwise not in
service. The progress of a safety function processor through its instruction sequence should not
be affected by any message from outside its division. For example, a received message should
not be able to direct the processor to execute a subroutine or branch to a new instruction
sequence.
As discussed in Sections 2.2, 3.2.1, and 3.1 of this SE, the Tricon V10 platform is a qualified
TMR system and is not dependent upon interdivisional communications or external systems to
perform the safety function. P2P and SAP communication protocols are utilized for
safety-critical communications between the SR Tricon V10 controller and other Tricon
controllers or SR systems. However, the Tricon P2P and SAP messages support data
exchange only. There are no “flow-of-control” message functions in the P2P or SAP protocols.
Moreover, the RXM Chassis provides no means to send software instructions to the SR 3008N
MP. The RXM Chassis only provides the capability to handle I/O at remote locations. The I/O
Bus protocol is a single-threaded, command-response serial protocol for transferring I/O data as
well as I/O module status. By design, software commands allowing remote control of the SR
3008N MP from the RXM Chassis is not possible. Firmware changes are performed while the
RXMs are removed from the chassis. Any modifications to the I/O subsystem configuration,
such as adding or deleting an I/O module(s) or changing to a different model I/O module, would
be a significant hardware change to the Tricon system and could not be performed on line.

– 89 –
Also, the design of the RXMs does not enable data exchanges between RXM Chassis in
different safety divisions or channels.
As discussed in Sections 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.3.2 of this SE, with the Tricon Operational Mode
Change keyswitch in RUN, each Tricon V10 is independent of other channels/divisions. Any
architecture in which one division relies upon data from another division would be site-specific
and thus would warrant plant-specific reviews by the NRC staff. The Tricon V10 system
Operational Mode Change keyswitch does change operational modes of the 3008N MPs and
enables the TriStation 1131 PC to change parameters, software algorithms, etc, related to the
application program of the safety channel without the channel or division being in bypass or in
trip. As stated in Section 3.1.3.2 of the SE, the TriStation 1131 PC should not normally be
connected while the Tricon V10 is operational and performing safety critical functions.
However, it is physically possible for the TriStation PC to be connected at all times, and this
should be strictly controlled via administrative controls (e.g., place the respective channel out of
service while changing the software, parameters, etc). Furthermore, in order to leave the nonsafety TriStation 1131 PC attached to the SR Tricon V10 system while the key switch is in the
RUN position, a detailed FMEA of the TriStation 1131 PC system will be required to ascertain
the potential effects that this non-safety PC may have on the execution of the safety application
program/operability of the channel or division. This would be evaluated on an application
specific basis.
Based on the design of the Tricon V10 platform as evaluated above and strict administrative
controls (as indicated above) over the use of these keys switches the NRC staff has determined
that the Tricon V10 platform does comply with Staff Position 1, Point 11.
3.7.3.1.12 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 12
Staff Position 1, Point 12, states that communication faults should not adversely affect the
performance of required safety functions in any way. Faults, including communication faults,
originating in non-safety equipment, do not constitute “single failures” as described in the single
failure criterion of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A. This section provides 12 examples of credible
communication faults, but cautions that the possible communication faults are not limited to the
list of 12.
As discussed in Points 2 and 4 above, electrical and functional isolation of the 3008N MPs are
provided by the TCM, which has a reliable design, and includes several engineered layers of
protection against communication failures. As stated previously, the SR TCM handles all
external communications, and thus serves as an isolation or buffer for the TMR 3008N MPs
from communications data. Also, as described in Section 3.1.2.8 of this SE, the Tricon
communication P2P and SAP protocols provide end-to-end integrity checks of all
communications data. The design and operation of the Tricon V10 is intended to prevent
communication faults from altering the application program or its performance.
In conjunction with these platform design features, testing was performed by an independent
third-party (Wurldtech) to validate the robustness of the Tricon V10 platform against
communication failures. Wurldtech performed testing of a number of scenarios testing the
communications link in the presence of a communications failure. This testing is discussed in
this SE Section 3.8.1.2, and is documented in Appendix A of IOM Document
No. NTX-SER-10-14 (Reference 35). This report and the data it contains is proprietary, and will
not be discussed in this SE. However, in summary this testing verified the effectiveness of the
TCM to cope with various communication failures, such as proper handling of rogue and invalid

– 90 –
protocol packets, and continued operation under network storm conditions without adverse
impact on the TMR 3008N MP control algorithm. Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP
protocols were tested. The test configuration included monitoring of digital output signals to
confirm that the Tricon application program running on the TMR 3008N MPs was unperturbed.
This testing validated that the TCM will discard rogue, invalid, and excessive Ethernet packets
(such as during data storms), thereby ensuring the operation of the TMR 3008N MPs was
unperturbed during communication failures. The results of the Wurldtech testing validated the
added reliability that the TCM provides to the communication link. Furthermore, as discussed in
the IOM Document No. NTX-SER-09-10, Revision 2, “Compliance with NRC Interim Guidance
ISG-2 & ISG-4,” the P2P and SAP communications protocol design further enhances mitigation
of communication faults, including those enumerated in the Staff Position, Point 12. Also,
communications data faults emanating from non-safety remote RXMs are mitigated by the data
validation features of the master and slave CPUs within the SR primary RXMs and the IOCCOM
processor in the MPs.
Based on the robust design of the Tricon V10 platform to mitigate or eliminate communications
data errors, and the NRC staff's review of the Wurldtech report (as discussed in Section 3.8.3.1
of this SE) allowed the NRC staff to determine that communications faults, including the 12
examples contained in Staff Position 1, Point 12, will not adversely affect the performance of the
required safety functions, and that the Tricon V10 platform complies with Staff Position 1,
Point 12.
3.7.3.1.13 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 13
Staff Position 1, Point 13, states that vital communications, such as the sharing of channel trip
decisions for the purpose of voting, should include provisions for ensuring that received
messages are correct and are properly understood. Such communications should employ errordetecting or error-correcting coding along with means for dealing with corrupt, invalid, untimely
or otherwise questionable data. The effectiveness of error detection/correction should be
demonstrated in the design and proof testing of the associated codes, but once demonstrated is
not subject to periodic testing. Error-correcting methods, if used, should be shown to always
reconstruct the original message exactly or to designate the message as unrecoverable. None
of this activity should affect the operation of the safety-function processor.
As discussed in Section 3.1.1 of this SE, each Tricon TMR-channel monitors dedicated sensors
allowing bi-stable logic within the Tricon V10 to operate completely independent of other
Tricon-channels/divisions. As shown in Figure 2-2, the termination panels pass input signals
from the field to an input module or pass signals generated by an output module directly to field
wiring. The Tricon V10 LTR does not propose any interchannel/interdivisional communications
or input from any external systems to perform the Tricon V10 safety function and therefore,
each channel is not dependent upon any information or resource originating from outside its
own safety division.
Staff Position 1 Point 1 explains how each Tricon V10 is self-contained. Architectures involving
vital communications between channels or divisions, such as for voting trip decisions, are
supported using the P2P and SAP SR communication protocols, as explained in Section 3.7.1
of this SE. However, such architectures would be site-specific, and would require staff review
and approval on an application specific basis. Also, there are no data exchanges between RXM
Chassis in different safety divisions or trains. Furthermore, non-safety Remote RXM Chassis
will not be utilized for vital communications.

– 91 –
The NRC staff reviewed the Tricon V10 system as described above and in the LTR and
determined that this configuration of the Tricon V10 platform complies with Staff Position 1,
Point 13.
3.7.3.1.14 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 14
Staff Position 1, Point 14, states that vital communications should be point-to-point by means of
a dedicated medium (copper or optical cable). In this context, “point-to-point” means that the
message is passed directly from the sending node to the receiving node without the involvement
of equipment outside the division of the sending or receiving node. Implementation of other
communication strategies should provide the same reliability and should be justified.
As discussed in Section 3.1.1 of this SE, each Tricon TMR-channel monitors dedicated sensors
allowing bi-stable logic within the Tricon V10 to operate completely independent of other
Tricon-channels/divisions. The Tricon V10 system is triple redundant from input terminal to
output terminal. Figure 2-2 shows the arrangement of the input, main processor, and output
modules. The termination panels pass vital input signals directly from the field to an input
module or pass signals generated by an output module directly to field wiring. Each input and
output module includes three separate and independent input or output circuits or legs. These
input/output legs communicate independently in a point-to point manner with the three main
processor modules. The Tricon V10 LTR does not propose any interchannel/interdivisional
communications or input from any external systems to perform the Tricon V10 safety function
and therefore, each channel is not dependent upon any information or resource originating from
outside its own safety division. As described in Section 3.8.1.2 of this SE, the LTR and IOM
Document No. NTX-SER-10-14 (Reference 35) credit the triplicated communications busses
(I/O and COMBUS) as being physically separate. The communications processors (IOCCOM)
are autonomous and separate from the safety function (application) processors.
Communications between the safety function processor and its IOCCOM is point-to-point using
a half-duplex master-slave protocol. IOCCOM is scan based with no interrupts and gives
priority to safety I/O communications by design. CRC checks are performed on all data
received by IOCCOM through both I/O and COMBUS paths. The Tricon V10 system utilizes
point-to-point routed network communications protocol and media, copper and fiber optic cables
to communicate data externally. All external communications uses a two-point network, where
there is no equipment other than the sending and receiving nodes on the network. All
communication protocols for vital communications (i.e., communications that are needed to
support a safety function) support redundant communication links. Additionally, there is no data
exchange between Remote RXM Chassis in different safety divisions or trains, and non-safety
Remote RXM Chassis are not be utilized for vital communications.
The NRC staff has reviewed this information and has determined that the Tricon V10 platform
as described above and in the V10 LTR complies with Staff Position 1, Point 14, for
point-to-point communications.
3.7.3.1.15 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 15
Staff Position 1, Point 15, states that communications for safety functions should communicate
a fixed set of data (called the "state") at regular intervals, whether data in the set has changed
or not.
As described above in Sections 3.1.3.1 and 3.7.3.1.7 of this SE, communications for safety
functions have predefined data sets and therefore, communicate a fixed set of data. This data

– 92 –
is sent every scan cycle and at regular intervals, whether data in the set has changed or not.
NTX-SER-09-10 Section 5.0 discusses the Tricon scan cycle in detail. In summary, at least
once every Scan Task the I/O input data is retrieved and I/O data sets are sent to the I/O
modules. The I/O Bus message formats are fixed (though data length can vary depending upon
the valid command-response sequence).
Communications to external SR applications are limited to Tricon V10-compatible protocols.
Each protocol is well-defined and ordered (e.g., number of start and stop bits, timing, data frame
format, number of data fields and check sum or CRC field). If an error were to occur, the
communication processor would reject the message. Again, message length may vary because
an external device may request a different number of data points within each request. Based on
this information, the NRC staff has determined that the communications data set and
transmission intervals as used in the Tricon V10 platform complies with Staff Position 1,
Point 15.
3.7.3.1.16 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 16
Staff Position 1, Point 16, states that network connectivity, liveness, and real-time properties
essential to the safety application should be verified in the protocol. Liveness, in particular, is
taken to mean that no connection to any network outside the division can cause an RPS/ESFAS
communication protocol to stall, either deadlock or livelock. [Note: This is also required by the
independence criteria of: (1) 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A, GDC 24, which states,
“interconnection of the protection and control systems shall be limited so as to assure that
safety is not significantly impaired,” and (2) IEEE Std 603-1991, “IEEE Standard Criteria for
Safety Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations” (Source: NUREG/CR-6082,
Section 3.4.3)].
As described in Staff Position 1, Point 1, the Tricon V10 LTR does not propose any
interchannel/interdivisional communications or input from any external systems to perform the
Tricon V10 safety function and therefore, each channel is not dependent upon any information
or resource originating from outside its own safety division. Also, the independence of the
Tricon V10 controllers from external devices discussed in Staff Position 1, Points 1 and 2
describe the independence of Tricon V10 controllers from external devices, which includes
engineered layers of protection against communication failures. The TCM has been qualified
under IOM Appendix B program, and it provides functional and electrical isolation for the TMR
3008N MP safety processors.
As discussed in Section 3.1.2.8 of this SE, the P2P and SAP communications protocols are
used for communications of safety critical data between other Tricon platforms and SVDU
respectively. End-to-end integrity checking of SR communications links is provided through the
use of validation bits and timing within the message, so that the receiving Tricon or SVDU, as
appropriate, is “aware” that the messages are current and not static. If the messages are
detected to be static, lost, or significantly delayed, the receiving Tricon/SVDU activates an
alarm. In the case of a receiving SR Tricon, it will assume the “fail-safe” status of the
transmitting Tricon.
The I/O Bus is an "internal system" bus based on RS485. The I/O Bus protocol is
single-threaded master-slave serial protocol. By design, one command message is sent from
the SR IOCCOM at a time and no other command messages are sent until a valid response
from the non-safety I/O module is received, or the message thread times out. Also, every Scan
Task, the SR IOCCOM polls a given I/O module at most once every 10 msec. Based upon this

– 93 –
information, the NRC staff has determined that the Tricon V10 platform meets the guidance
provided by Staff Position 1, Point 16, for network connectivity.
3.7.3.1.17 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 17
Staff Position 1, Point 17, states that pursuant to 10 CFR 50.49, the medium used in a vital
communications channel should be qualified for the anticipated normal and post-accident
environments. For example, some optical fibers and components may be subject to gradual
degradation as a result of prolonged exposure to radiation or to heat. In addition, new digital
systems may need susceptibility testing for EMI/RFI and power surges, if the environments are
significant to the equipment being qualified.
The environmental qualification for the Tricon V10 platform is described in the Section 3.3 of this
SE. The generic qualification of the Tricon V10 encompasses both the hardware and the
software used in the system. The hardware includes termination assemblies, signal
conditioners, chassis, power supplies, main processor modules, communication modules,
input/output modules, termination assemblies, module interconnecting cables, and Class 1E to
Non-Class 1E module Isolation devices. The Tricon V10 platform was qualified in accordance
with the EPRI TR-107330 requirements. The medium used for vital communications within the
platform was a part of each of the systems qualified and is therefore qualified as described.
The Tricon V10 platform was tested for EMI and RFI to demonstrate its qualification as a SR
device with respect to EMI/RFI emissions and susceptibility. The platform was also subjected to
Electrical Fast Transient (EFT) and Surge Withstand testing to demonstrate its qualification as a
SR device with respect to susceptibility to repetitive EFTs on the power and signal input/output
leads, and AC power and signal line electrical surge withstand capability. The NRC staff
approved this qualification testing within the qualification limits noted in Section 3.3 of this SE.
However, as noted in Section 3.3.1 of this SE, the qualification of the Tricon V10 does not
include the fiber optic cables used to connect external devices to the safety application
processor via the TCM or the RXMs. Therefore, an application specific evaluation will be
required for plant specific applications of the Tricon V10 system utilizing fiber optic cables to
connect external devices to the Tricon V10 platform.
The NRC staff has determined that the Tricon V10 platform meets the guidance provided by
Staff Position 1, Point 17. However, as noted above, fiber optic cables used to implement the
Tricon V10 system in safety applications will require application specific review to verify these
cables are qualified for the environment in which they will be used, in accordance with
10 CFR 50.49 as applicable.
3.7.3.1.18 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 18
Staff Position 1, Point 18, states that provisions for communications should be analyzed for
hazards and performance deficits posed by unneeded functionality and complication.
IOM performed a FMEA on the Tricon V10 system in accordance with the applicable
requirements of EPRI TR-107330 Section 6.4.1. In general, the techniques of ANSI/IEEE
Std 352-1987 were used in the analysis. The results of the FMEA are documented in IOM
Document No. 9600164-531, “Failure Modes and Effects Analysis for the Tricon Version 10.2
Programmable Logic Controller” (Reference 28). The FMEA addresses failures of major
components and at the module level. The approach was appropriate because sub-components

– 94 –
in the Tricon modules are triple-redundant, and no single failure of an individual subcomponent
can impact the ability of the Tricon to perform its SR functions.
To summarize, the Tricon Communication Module (TCM) handles all communications protocol,
start/stop bits, handshaking, etc. tasks. The 3008M MPs are neither burdened nor interrupted
by communications faults. Communication errors and malfunctions do not interfere with the
execution of the safety function. Exchange of data between the communication processors and
MPs occur once each MP scan cycle. Because all the communication with external devices,
systems, and hosts is performed by and localized in the TCM, the 3008N MPs are alleviated of
unneeded communications functionality and attendant complications due to complexity. This
mitigates any deficiencies in the TCM with regard to performance deficits posed by unneeded
functionality.
The I/O Bus is an internal system bus based on RS485. The I/O Bus protocol is single-threaded
master-slave serial protocol. By design one command message is sent from the SR IOCCOM,
and no other is sent until a valid response from the non-safety I/O module is received, or the
data thread times out. Also, every Scan Task, the SR IOCCOM polls a given I/O module at
most once every 10 msec. The RXMs are relatively simple modules, because they simply act
as I/O Bus repeaters with gatekeeper functionality implemented within the RXM processors.
This analysis included potential failures of communications used within the Tricon V10 system.
The NRC staff reviewed and concurred with this FMEA in Section 3.5 of this SE. In addition, the
Tricon self-diagnostic features have been specifically designed to detect and alarm failures of
sub-components within each module. Extensive testing has been performed on each module to
validate that the diagnostics detect all possible single failures within each module.
IOM also provide a FMEA for the non-safety Remote RXM chassis in Table 3 of
NTX-SER-09-10, Revision 2, which is considered an extension of the Tricon V10 FMEA
discussed in Section 3.5 of this SE. This assessment identified the mechanisms that could
cause the failure modes, and evaluated the consequences of the failures on the operation of the
SR portion of the configuration (i.e., SR 3008N MPs, Primary RXM chassis, and I/O modules).
Because of the architecture of the Tricon, failure mechanisms that affect a single leg of the triple
redundant system generally have no effect on system operation. Therefore, the FMEA
considered (1) failure mechanisms that are recognized as being highly unlikely but that could
affect multiple components, and (2) the coincident occurrence of otherwise single failures
(i.e., multiple failures). Multiple-failure scenarios include failures of all three non-safety Remote
RXMs due to software common mode failure, loss of all power, fire, floods, or missiles. These
types of multiple-failure scenarios are recognized as being very unlikely, but were included to
describe system behavior in the presence of severe failures. Congestion is not a concern,
because the I/O Bus is a closed system utilizing a single-threaded master-slave serial protocol
based on RS485. By design one command message is sent from the SR IOCCOM and no
other messages are sent until a valid response from the non-safety I/O module is received, or
the message thread times out. Also, the SR IOCCOM polls a given I/O module at most once
every 10 msec. Therefore, data rates are strictly defined and controlled.
The NRC staff determined that these failure modes and effects analyses for the Tricon V10
system meet the guidance provided in Staff Position 1, Point 18.

– 95 –
3.7.3.1.19 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 19
Staff Position 1, Point 19, states that the communications data rates be such that they will not
exceed the capacity of a communications link or the ability of nodes to handle traffic, and that all
links and nodes have sufficient capacity to support all functions. To do this, the applicant should
identify the true data rate, including overhead, to ensure that communication bandwidth is
sufficient to ensure proper performance of all safety functions and that communications
throughput thresholds and safety system sensitivity to communications throughput issues
should be confirmed by testing.
Communications within the Tricon V10 platform is cyclic in nature as described in
Sections 3.1.3.1 and 3.7.3.1.4 of this SE. The Communication task runs every 10 msec or
when a communication port interrupt occurs. Factors which affect the platform communications
performance include: COMBUS speed; the amount of aliased data and scan time; network
speed and loading; and the particular communication protocol being used. The COMBUS
speed determines the speed at which data is communicated between the 3008N MPs and
TCMs. If the amount of aliased data updated by the 3008N MPs is too large for a single scan,
then it may take several scans to update the aliased data stored in the TCMs. Network
communication speeds with the TCM is 100 megabits-per-second, which means that it is highly
unlikely that data transfer between the TCM and remote safety applications will be affected by
the physical network. In the event that the 3008N MPs are excessively burdened with data
requests, the Tricon continuously monitors system functions and performance, activating an
alarm should scan time exceed the predicted performance. Also, as discussed in
Sections 3.1.2.9 and 3.7.3.1.7 of this SE, extensive testing was performed by an independent
third-party (Wurldtech) to validate the robustness of the Tricon V10 platform against
communication failures. The Tricon V10 platform was tested to verify the robustness of the
TCM to various communication failures, such as proper handling of rogue and invalid protocol
packets, and continued operation under network storm conditions without adverse impact on the
TMR 3008N MP control algorithm. Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols were
tested. The test configuration included monitoring of digital output signals to confirm that the
Tricon application program running on the TMR 3008N MPs was unperturbed. Testing
validated that the TCM will discard rogue, invalid, and excessive Ethernet packets (such as
during data storms), thereby ensuring the operation of the TMR 3008N MPs was unperturbed
during communication failures.
However, in order to assess the platform's performance against this Staff Position, the entire
safety system application should be available and evaluated. For example, it is necessary to
understand the exact communication protocols used to implement communications between the
3008N MPs and external safety and non-SR applications. Based on the safety system design,
data transfer time calculations can be used to determine whether safety-critical timing
requirements in the plant-specific safety analysis are met by the Tricon V10 communications
protocols. Also, thorough program operational testing will need to be conducted to determine
the longest scan-time duration, identify the true system data rate, including overhead, and
ensure that communication bandwidth is sufficient to ensure proper performance of all safety
functions and that communications throughput thresholds and safety system sensitivity to
communications throughput issues are confirmed by testing.
Determination that the safety system communications data rates be such that they will not
exceed the capacity of a communications link or the ability of nodes to handle traffic and that all
links and nodes have sufficient capacity to support all functions is an application-specific activity
that requires an assessment of a full system design. Since the LTR does not address a specific

– 96 –
application and the scope of the platform does not include this system level information, no
evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against Staff Position 1, Point 19 could be performed.
Therefore, implementation of the Tricon V10 platform in safety system applications will require
application specific review to verify it meets the guidance of this Staff Position.
3.7.3.1.20 STAFF POSITION 1, POINT 20
Staff Position 1, Point 20, states that the safety system response time calculations should
assume a data error rate that is greater than or equal to the design basis error rate and is
supported by the error rate observed in design and qualification testing.
“Response time” is generally defined as the total time elapsed from initiation of a change in
process control signal at one end of an instrumentation loop (the detector or sensor) until the
end-of-loop actuated device reaches its final desired position. Safety system response time is
dependent upon the specific plant process and safety system architecture. The plant safety
analysis determines the response time required, including error rate, to prevent exceeding a
safety limit. The Tricon V10 processor is only one contributor to the overall response time
computation, and this variable is referred to as the “throughput” of the Tricon processor.
Throughput is generally referred to as the time required for processing a change in any signal or
variable from the input screws to output screws of the Tricon V10 cabinet. Throughput is
dependent upon a number of factors, such as the number of variables scanned, size and
complexity of the application program, when a change in a signal or variable is detected,
number of communications protocol variables being transmitted/received, etc.
Because of the number of factors involved, throughput cannot be exactly predicted for any given
configuration without knowing the exact safety system design. However, IOM did perform a
calculation of throughput, documented in IOM Document No. 9600164-731, Revision 0,
“Maximum Response Time Calculations” (Reference 43), which was used for the Tricon V10
qualification testing as required by Section 4.2.1-A of EPRI TR-107330, “General Functional
Requirements,” Part A, “Response Time.” The TR specifies that, “the overall response time
from an input to the PLC exceeding its trip condition to the resulting outputs being set shall be
100 msec or less.” IOM analysis determined that the theoretical maximum response time for
different combinations of Digital Inputs, Digital Outputs, AIs and AOs. The analysis indicates
that none of these combinations of input and output modules comply with the 100 msec
requirement (i.e., they all exceed this value). However, this analysis may be useful in
determining the overall throughput for a safety system. Actual scan time, throughput, and data
error rates will be measured and recorded during the plant-specific Factory Acceptance Tests
(FATs).
Determination that the safety system response time calculations should assume a data error
rate that is greater than or equal to the design basis error rate and is supported by the error rate
observed in design and qualification testing is an application-specific activity that requires an
assessment of a full system design. Since the LTR does not address a specific application and
the scope of the platform does not include this system level information, no evaluation of the
Tricon V10 platform against Staff Position 1, Point 20 could be performed. Therefore,
implementation of the Tricon V10 platform in safety system applications will require application
specific review to verify that it meets the guidance of this Staff Position.

3.7.3.2

DI&C-ISG-04, SECTION 2 - COMMAND PRIORITIZATION

Section 2 of DI&C-ISG-04 provides guidance applicable to a prioritization device or software
function block, which receives device actuation commands from multiple safety and non-safety
sources, and sends the command having highest priority on to the actuated device.
The design of field device interfaces and the determination of means for command prioritization
is an ASAI. Since the LTR does not address a specific application, no evaluation against this
staff position could be performed.
3.7.3.3

DI&C-ISG-04, SECTION 3 - MULTIDIVISIONAL CONTROL AND DISPLAY
STATIONS

Section 3 of DI&C-ISG-04 provides guidance concerning operator workstations used for the
control of plant equipment in more than one safety division and for display of information from
sources in more than one safety division, and applies to workstations that are used to program,
modify, monitor, or maintain safety systems that are not in the same safety division as the
workstation.
The design of information displays and operator workstations and the determination of
information sources and interconnections is an ASAI. Since the LTR does not address a
specific application nor include display devices within the scope of the platform, no evaluation
against this staff position could be performed.
3.8

SECURE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

RG 1.152, Revision 3, describes a method that the NRC deems acceptable for complying with
the Commission’s regulations to promote high functional reliability, design quality, and
establishment of secure development and operational environments for the use of digital
computers in SR systems at nuclear power plants. Specifically, the guidance for secure
development and operational environment measures states that potential vulnerabilities should
be addressed in each phase of the digital safety system life cycle. The overall guidance
provides the basis for physical and logical access controls to be established throughout the
digital system development process to address the susceptibility of a digital system to
inadvertent access.
IOM submitted a separate document, IOM Document No. NTX-SER-10-14, “Tricon V10
Conformance to Regulatory Guide 1.152” (Reference 35), that provides a detailed description of
the Tricon V10 conformance to RG 1.152, Revision 2. The differences between Revision 2 and
Revision 3 for Clauses 2.1 – 2.5 are minor and the NRC staff reviewed the information
considering both versions. Cyber security elements of Revision 2 and Clauses 2.6-2.9 are not
addressed in this SE.
3.8.1

LIFECYCLE PHASES

IOM’s lifecycle framework does not match one to one against the lifecycle phases identified in
RG 1.152, Revision 3. Table 3.8.1-1 shows a comparison of the phases for platform
development outlined in IOM’s EDM and application development outlined in the NSIPM.

– 98 –

Table 3.8.1-1 Lifecycle Stages Comparison
The lifecycle phases outlined for platform development in the EDM were reviewed and accepted
under the Tricon V9 SE (Reference 9) Section 4.2.2. The NRC staff reviewed the changes to
the EDM as part of the Tricon V10 evaluation and determined that IOM’s commitments were
expanded or were unchanged. Because the EDM process changes did not diminish previous
commitments, the NRC staff determined that the Tricon V9 conclusions discussed in
Section 4.2.2 of the SE sufficiently support the lifecycle requirements of RG 1.152, Revision 3.
The NRC staff did not complete a review of the NSIPM, as stated in Section 2.1 of this SE.
Conclusions regarding the NSIPM were left as an ASAI.
IOM describes the development environment in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of IOM Document No.
NTX-SER-10-14, “Tricon V10 Conformance to RG 1.152” (Reference 35), detailing the secure
development controls in place. Physical access is controlled through security access cards and
is supplemented by the use of photo identification badges. Network access is globally managed
at the corporate level where partitioning by responsibility limits access of individual users.
Source code access is limited through the configuration management tool. The tool limits write
access to developers. Wurldtech, a third party organization that provided independent security
testing and review noted that all developer level personnel can access code for projects they
are not directly supporting. However, IOM mitigates this through administrative controls in the
release process which includes code reviews by multiple reviewers and hard copy offline
storage of the final releases. Also, the independent third party review performed by TÜV
includes a code review.
Manufacturing occurs at a separate IOM facility outside the U.S. Software and firmware are
loaded at the IOM manufacturing site to facilitate testing. However, IOM manufacturing process
requires all received subassemblies (modules) to undergo inspection and card level test and
verification of all configuration items including firmware and software. IOM also employs
automated configuration management systems that help to eliminate human error during
verification of configuration items. At final inspection IOM performs a firmware “dump” from the
configuration item and compares all firmware version numbers from the dump to the list
generated by the automated configuration management system.

– 99 –
The NRC staff observed elements of the secure development environment during the December
2010 audit at IOM’s Irvine, California facility (Reference 6). The NRC staff also reviewed
Sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Tricon V9 SE and find that the previous conclusions still apply.
Based on a review of IOM document NTX-SER-10-14 Section 3.1 (Reference 35) regarding
secure development environment and a comparison to the previously reviewed development
environment from the Tricon V9 SE (Reference 9) combined with direct observations of the
current development environment at IOM’s facility in Irvine, California, the NRC staff finds that
IOM meets the requirements for secure development environment in RG 1.152, Revision 3. It is
an ASAI to verify that the secure development environment has not changed and to confirm that
the application secure development environment is the equivalent or otherwise meets the
requirements of RG 1.152, Revision 3.
Without a specific operational environment to assess, the NRC staff cannot reach a final
conclusion on the Tricon V10 platform’s ability to withstand undesirable behavior of connected
systems and preclude inadvertent access. However, the Tricon V10 platform does have
features that could be credited by a licensee when demonstrating these protections. Final
conclusions regarding protection from undesirable behavior from connected systems and
inadvertent access in the operational environment must be an ASAI.
3.8.1.1

CONCEPTS PHASE

Security Capabilities
As stated in the Regulatory Position 2.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, the Concepts Phase is the
phase in which “the licensee and developer should identify safety system security capabilities
that should be implemented.”
Development Environment - The NRC staff reviewed the Tricon V10 development
documentation and determined that the development process did incorporate several
security features that apply to the secure development and operating environment of the
system. Even though a formal concepts phase security analysis was not performed, the
application development process outlined in the NSIPM supports the security concepts used
during the development of the Tricon V10 platform.
IOM has identified the following security capabilities as having been implemented during the
Tricon V10 platform development processes.
•
•
•
•
•

network firewall protection,
server and workstation anti-virus protection,
password-based access control,
administrative restrictions on write permissions, and
control of source code versions and protection of record versions in a source-code
repository.

Operational Features - IOM also identified the following security features intended to protect
the Tricon V10 system from unauthorized access and modification.
•

Tricon keyswitch – The triplicated 3008N MP modules vote on the position of the
keyswitch to determine, among other things, whether downloads from the TriStation
1131 are allowed. With the keyswitch in “RUN” mode, downloads from the TriStation
1131 are rejected.

– 100 –
•

•

•

•
•

Runtime memory check – The application (or “control”) program is downloaded into
flash memory on the 3008N MPs. During runtime, the control program is transferred
to and executed from RAM. Periodically the control program in RAM is compared to
the control program (i.e., the downloaded application program) in flash memory to
ensure system integrity.
Role-based access – The TriStation 1131 programming tool provides up to ten levels
of password protection. Access to TriStation 1131 functionality can then be based
on the user’s job responsibility, e.g., System Engineer versus Maintenance
Technician.
Communication integrity checking – End-to-end integrity of the communications is
ensured through the use of CRCs on the 3008N MPs (i.e., IOCCOM, DPRAM, and
the Application Processor). For communication data links utilizing P2P and/or SAP
in the fielded system, the application program logic that interfaces with the data link
is defined and interpreted in the SR 3008N MP, which adds another layer of security.
Access control lists – The TCM can be configured to restrict access based on IP
addresses.
Read/Write access control – The TCM can be configured to restrict access by
external devices to read-only operations.

The NRC staff concluded that the security concept defined in NTX-SER-10-14 (Reference 35)
and the platform capabilities identified in that document comply with this criterion from
Regulatory Position 2.1 regarding identification of safety system security capabilities.
Identification of Life Cycle Vulnerabilities
Regulatory Position 2.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, also states that “the licensee and developer
should perform security assessment to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the relevant
phases of the system life cycle. The results of the analysis should be used to establish security
requirements for the system (hardware and software).”
Development Environment - Appendix B of NTX-SER-10-14 (Reference 35) also lists the
Tricon V10 Potential Vulnerabilities for each phase of the development process for the
platform. No vulnerabilities were identified for the Concept or Requirements phases. For
other development process phases, the following vulnerabilities were identified:
Design Phase
• Synergy Read Access – All Employees who have access to Synergy have read
access to Tricon V10 code.
• Synergy Read/Write Access – All employees with developer privileges are
allowed to modify Tricon V10 code.
Implementation Phase
• Build Control – The task of building a release is assigned to one person and
there is no secondary verification that the build included the correct source.
Test Phase
• Factory Acceptance Testing – IOM facility has physical access controls and
network access controls to network resources, the staging area for system
integration testing is located in an open area within the building. There are no
controls over physical access to staged nuclear SR systems.

– 101 –
Operational Environment - IOM has identified the security vulnerabilities of systems
developed with the Tricon V10 platform as follows:
• Deficiencies in the design that may allow inadvertent, unintended, or unauthorized
access or modifications to the safety system that may degrade the reliability, integrity
or functionality of the safety system during operations; or
• Inability of the system to sustain the safety function in the presence of undesired
behavior of connected systems.
The vulnerability assessment also identified the following additional platform vulnerabilities:
Tricon Design
• Keyswitch – All Tricon Controllers are shipped with identical keys and there is
currently no procedure in place for a customer to order a different key for their
systems.
• RXM 4200 – series fiber optic cables – The fiber optic cables to extend the I/O
Bus between the RXM chassis can be cut or damaged.
Tricon Communications Module
• TSAA, MODBUS, MODBUS TCP, Peer-to-Peer – Packet injection of valid
packets.
• Reboot command from trusted node – The TCM can be re-booted from a nonsafety device.
• Network Routing Capability – The TCM can be configured to route network
packets.
• Telnet Server – The TCM has a Telnet server that can be accessed in the field.
This allows reboot of TCM, placing the TCM in download mode, and allows
changing of route tables.
• FTP Server – The TCM has an FTP server that can be accessed in the field.
This allows transferring files to and from the TCM.
Tristation 1131
• Security of Tristation 1131 – The Tristation 1131 provides the capability to create,
modify, and download application programs to the Tricon controllers. The tool
will likely be installed on maintenance workstations and laptops at licensee
facilities.
• Default username and password – TriStation 1131 projects are created with
default username and password at the highest level of privilege.
• Man-in-the-Middle during download – During download of an application
program, the Tricon is placed into the “program” mode. The network connection
is susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attack whereby malicious code could be
installed.
The NRC staff determined that the identified vulnerabilities adequately address the potential for
tampering with the Tricon V10 platform during the developmental phases associated with either
maintenance of IOM developed software or configuration of the platform to support an
application. The vulnerabilities identified in the analyses contribute to the basis for security
functional requirements for the platform, and support the determination of appropriate security
controls for system hardware and software development. Based on the NRC staff review of the
vulnerabilities identified and recognition that process and platform requirements to address
these vulnerabilities through the various life cycles have been established, the NRC staff has

– 102 –
determined that IOM has met this criterion of Regulatory Position 2.1 in RG 1.152, Revision 3,
for the Tricon V10 platform.
Remote Access and One-Way Communication
The guidance in Section 2.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states that implementation of remote
access to a SR system should not be allowed. In addition, any transfer of data to other systems
by computer-based SR systems should be limited to one-way communication pathways.
The LTR does not address a specific application, establish a definitive safety system design, nor
identify any plant I&C architectures so this criterion must be evaluated at the application level.
This is an ASAI.
IOM stated that the Tricon V10 system allows for and supports bi-directional communications
with external devices and hosts. The Tricon V10 has been tested and certified by third-parties
that communications errors, including unexpected operation of connected equipment, will not
corrupt the safety function of the Triple Modular Redundant (TMR) 3008N MPs. The NRC staff
reviewed non-safety to safety communications in Section 3.7.2 of this SE.
3.8.1.2

REQUIREMENTS PHASE

Security Functional Performance Requirements
Section 2.2.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states in part that developers should define the security
functional performance requirements and system configuration for a SR system. Security
requirements for interfaces external to the system should be established by developers as well.
Also, the developers should address security requirements for qualification, human factors
engineering, data definitions, documentation of the software and hardware, installation and
acceptance practices, operation and execution conditions, and maintenance activities.
The Tricon V10 security concept, as documented in NTX-SER-10-14 (Reference 35), identifies
secure operational environment features of the platform that are traceable to functional
performance requirements:
Protection from Undesired Behavior of Connected Systems - All external runtime
communications to the Tricon V10 come through the TCM which has two Ethernet ports and
four serial ports. IOM did not qualify all of the commercial functionality available via serial
port connections and the vulnerability testing performed by Wurldtech documented in
Appendix A of NTX-SER-10-14 (Reference 35) applies to Ethernet ports only. However,
most of the protection IOM credited pertains to the overall architecture and is not specific to
the individual ports.
IOM credited the overall architecture and highlighted specific features of individual elements
for protecting the safety function from the undesirable behavior of connected systems in
IOM Document No. NTX-SER-10-14, Section 3.3.3 (Reference 35). Other supporting
information was supplied in the LTR Section 2.
The NRC staff reviewed the Tricon V9 SE (Reference 9), the LTR, and NTX-SER-10-14
(Reference 35). IOM credits the triplicated communications busses (I/O and COMBUS)
being physically separate. The communications processor (IOCCOMM) is autonomous and
separate from the application processor. IOCCOMM uses a half-duplex master-slave

– 103 –
protocol with a timeout on every message to communicate over both the I/O and COMBUS.
IOCCOM is scan based with limited interrupts and gives priority to safety I/O
communications by design. CRC checks are performed on all data received by IOCCOM
through both I/O and COMBUS paths.
IOM also credits the TCM access control. A TCM can be programmed via TriStation 1131 to
communicate only with predetermined IP addresses and also allows users to dictate specific
read and write permissions for each IP address. Although the TCM access control feature
seems to provide a one-way communication tool to meet DI&C-ISG-04 safety to non-safety
criteria, the NRC staff credits it as an element of protection from connected systems to
satisfy this criterion.
The NRC staff also reviewed the Wurldtech Achilles Level One testing criteria. IOM credits
the test as a demonstration of the Tricon’s ability to maintain the safety function during a
period of extreme network traffic or data storm. The test itself has not been endorsed by
NRC. However, based on a review of the test criteria on the Wurldtech website and related
review details by MPR Associates in the CDR report (Reference 32), the NRC staff accepts
the test results as a demonstration of Tricon’s ability to protect the safety function.
All IOM modules have a debug or test port that may be used to load updates. Most of these
ports are not accessible when the module is plugged into the chassis. However, the TCM
and 3008N MP modules both have debug ports on the front panel. These ports can be used
to update firmware, but are disabled when the main chassis operating mode keyswitch is in
the “RUN” position. Other aspects of controlling access to these ports are covered below
under “Inadvertent Access”.
A remote RXM chassis may connect to non-safety I/O. The NRC staff finds that connection
acceptable as described in Section 3.7.2.2 of this report. The safety to non-safety barrier is
at the RXM in the SR primary RXM chassis and safety and non-safety I/O are not connected
on the same remote RXM chassis (a requirement of IEEE Std 603-1991).
Protection from Unintended Access - IOM uses several physical methods to prevent
inadvertent access including redundant modules, debug port access control and system
operating mode keyswitch. The features are intended to mitigate consequences of
removing the wrong module during maintenance, prevent unintended application code
changes and firmware changes. Redundant 3008N MP modules can maintain the safety
function when up to two of the three modules are inadvertently removed or become
inoperative. IOM’s Triple Modular Redundant (TMR) voting preferences are application
specific and are defined in the application program. Redundant I/O modules in hot standby
prevent a loss of safety channel if an active module is inadvertently removed or dislodged.
However, redundant I/O modules in hot standby are optional and not required for normal
operation and must be credited on the application specific review. System operating mode
is set using a keyed switch on the faceplate of the main chassis to one of four modes; Stop,
Run, Program or Remote. The module can only be reprogrammed by setting the keyswitch
to the “Program” mode. Debug ports on the face of all main processor modules and TCM’s
are deactivated during runtime.
The NRC staff determined that the Tricon V10 platform has met this criterion of Regulatory
Position 2.2.1 in RG 1.152, Revision 3.

– 104 –
Security Requirements Verification and Validation (V&V)
Regulatory Position 2.2.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, also states that security requirements should
be included within the overall system requirements. Therefore, the system security
requirements should be subject to treatment under the full V&V process activities of the overall
system to assure the correctness, completeness, accuracy, testability, and consistency of those
security requirements.
As stated in Section 4.3.3 of the IOM document, “EDM 90.00 Product Verification”
(Reference 50), a security analysis will be conducted at every phase of the software life cycle as
part of the V&V process applied to a development project. In addition, the V&V process applied
to the dedication of PDS was shown to address security requirements. Based on these
considerations and the review of the IOM V&V program discussed in Section 3.2 of this SE, the
NRC staff determined that the Tricon V10 platform has met this criterion of Regulatory
Position 2.2.1 in RG 1.152, Revision 3.
Use of Pre-Developed Software and Systems
Regulatory Position 2.2.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, further states that the security vulnerability of
a SR system should be addressed in any requirements specifying the use of pre-developed
software and systems (e.g., reuse of software and incorporation of commercial off-the-shelf
systems). In particular, the use of pre-developed software functions that have been tested and
are supported by operating experience is identified.
The pre-developed operating software of the TCM in the Tricon V10 platform underwent
dedication for use in SR applications. As described in Section 3.2.2 of this SE, the dedication
process indicates the quality and reliability of the PDS is acceptable. In addition, testing
performed as part of the CGD effort further established the quality and security characteristics of
the PDS. The dedicated operating software is controlled under the Tricon Software
Configuration Management program (SCMP) as evaluated in Section 3.2.1 of this SE and is
maintained under the Tricon software Quality Assurance program which is evaluated in
Section 3.2.1 (SQAP) evaluation of this SE. Based on the review of the CGD evidence for the
PDS and its ongoing management under the IOM quality processes, the NRC staff determined
that the Tricon V10 platform has satisfied this criterion of Regulatory Position 2.2.1 in RG 1.152,
Revision 3.
Development Activities
Regulatory Position 2.2.2 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states, “The development process should
ensure the system does not contain undocumented code (e.g., back door coding), malicious
code (e.g., intrusions, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or bomb codes), and other unwanted and
undocumented functions or applications.”
The key vulnerability to the requirements phase of the Tricon V10 platform development was
unauthorized changes of the requirements in the requirements specification and unauthorized
versions of the requirement specification. If appropriate controls are not placed on handling of
the requirements documentation, the opportunity exists for inappropriate requirements to be
inserted and/or necessary requirements to be omitted. As described previously, Security
Controls are in place at the Irvine facility when developing SR nuclear systems produced.
These controls provide assurance that the Tricon V10 platform code and plant-specific
application code are protected from unauthorized access and modification. Further,

– 105 –
administrative restrictions are implemented on write permissions, control of test procedures and
test code versions, and protection of record versions in the Agile repository. Agile is used as
the system of record for Tricon product lifecycle information, beginning at conception/planning,
through design, source, build, test, and maintenance, to retirement.
IOM procedures for specification of software requirements describe the organization, content
and structure of requirements specifications for the Tricon V10 platform. The NRC staff review
of these procedures found them to be acceptable, as described in Section 3.2.1. IOM uses
Rational Synergy tool for integrated configuration management of Tricon V10 platform software
code. IOM engineering procedures for software configuration change control define the Tricon
V10 software configuration and change process. The NRC staff reviewed these configuration
management controls in IOM document EDM 20.00, “Configuration Management”
(Reference 49). IOM procedures also provide assurance that the Tricon V10 does not have
undocumented codes (e.g., backdoor coding) and unwanted functions that could adversely
impact system reliability. Section 5.6 of IOM document EDM 12.00, “Product Development
Process” (Reference 19), states that verification activities occur after each phase of the design
lifecycle and that documentation and source code are independently reviewed following the
implementation phase.
Also, as described in Section 3.2.1, the software QA program addresses the design,
implementation, and commissioning of SR systems based on the Tricon V10 platform. The
program provides for measures to ensure the maintenance of records.
In addition, Security Controls that are used for SR nuclear systems produced at IOM facilities
include:
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

Physical access controls to the building.
Corporate policy on appropriate use of email and network resources.
Local policy on the use of computer resources and removable media on nuclear system
integration projects and equipment.
Network access controls. Access to network resources is based upon job responsibility,
therefore R&D engineers, for example, do not have access to the Manufacturing network
resources. Also, only engineers involved in nuclear system integration projects have
access to nuclear projects folders. Furthermore, Irvine employees have limited access
to network resources at other IOM locations that is also based upon work
responsibilities.
Managed Virtual Private Networks. Access is granted after special request. Several
methods for VPN access are used, such as secure tokens.
Managed firewalls and DMZs partition the network using current best practices to isolate
the corporate network from the outside; Wireless access points for “Guest” accounts are
outside the firewall.
Network server and workstation virus scanning.
Controls over Tricon V10 source code and build process.
Controls over the Tricon manufacturing process.

Based on the IOM procedures to reconstitute and trace requirements, as well as the controls in
place to protect their requirements documentation, the NRC staff determined that the Tricon
V10 platform has met the provisions of Section 2.2.2 of RG 1.152, Revision 3.

3.8.1.3

DESIGN PHASE

Security Design Configuration Items
Regulatory Position 2.3.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states “The safety system security
requirements identified in the system requirements specification should be translated into
specific design configuration items in the system design description. The safety system security
design configuration items should address control over (1) physical and logical access to the
system functions, (2) use of safety system services, and (3) data communication with other
systems. Design configuration items incorporating pre-developed software into the safety
system should address security vulnerabilities of the safety system.”
Regulatory Position 2.3.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, also states “Physical and logical access
control features should be based on the results of the assessment performed in the concepts
phase of the life cycle. The results of this assessment may identify the need for more complex
access control measures, such as a combination of knowledge (e.g., password), property
(e.g., key and smart card), or personal features (e.g., fingerprints), rather than just a password.”
As described before, IOM uses Agile repository to maintain records for Tricon product lifecycle
information, beginning at conception/planning, through design, source, build, test, and
maintenance, to retirement. All firmware/software versions are controlled and released into
Agile, as well as Software Requirements Definition (SRD) and the Software Control
Specification for the system. Software code is controlled with Synergy.
In this phase, the system security requirements stated in Section 3.8.1.1 of this SE are
translated into design configuration items. The secure operational environment requirements
for the Tricon V10 platform correspond to security-related features, capabilities, and design
elements that serve as design configuration items. In NTX-SER-10-14, IOM documented the
security design configuration for the Tricon V10 platform, as well as potential vulnerabilities for
each lifecycle phase. Section 3.8.1.2 (above Security Functional Performance Requirements)
summarizes the security control implemented in the design of the Tricon V10 platform related to
physical and logical access to the system functions. Section 3.8.1.1 ( above Platform Security
Capabilities) summarizes the security features of the Tricon V10 platform related to use of
safety system service and data communication with other systems to protect the Tricon V10
system from unauthorized access and modifications.
IOM has implemented measures to protect the application against inadvertent operator actions
and unintended operation of connected equipment. IOM identified the following security
features intended to protect the Tricon V10 system from unauthorized access and modification:
•
•
•

Tricon redundancy – pulling an active module will not shutdown the system, but will
cause a system alarm.
Maintenance/debug front panels – Physical ports are provided in the front panels for
debug and firmware update. This requires halting operation of the system, for the ports
to be activated.
Tricon keyswitch – key that determines the system operating mode. To download an
application, the key must be in the “Program” position.

Thus, conditions permitting overwrite of the application software cannot be inadvertently
triggered and adequate provisions are in place to protect the integrity of the installed application

– 107 –
software from alteration. Licensees should identify if and how to protect the Tricon keyswitch as
part of their establishment of a secure operational environment for the platform.
In NTX-SER-10-14, IOM stated the necessary security controls will be based on the results of
the security assessment performed during the Concept phase of the plant-specific SR
implementation of the Tricon V10. The security controls could be a combination of the Tricon
V10 security features described previously, plus any controls required by the Licensee’s site
Cyber Security Plan developed by the Licensee to comply with 10 CFR 73.54. Therefore,
additional security features required for the plant-specific application must be an ASAI.
Communication with non-safety systems are evaluated in Section 3.7.2 and conformance to
ISG-04 in Section 3.7.3 of this SE. An important design consideration of the Tricon V10 is that
communication failures do not adversely affect the safety function of the TMR 3008N MPs.
For plant-specific configurations utilizing the Tricon V10, the development process for SR
application software will be controlled under the IOM NSIPM.
The NRC staff determined that the Tricon V10 platform has met the criterion of Regulatory
Position 2.3.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3.
Development Activities
Regulatory Position 2.3.2 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states, “The developer should delineate the
standards and procedures that will conform with the applicable security policies to ensure the
system design products (hardware and software) do not contain undocumented code (e.g., back
door coding), malicious code (e.g., intrusions, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or bomb codes),
and other unwanted or undocumented functions or applications.”
As discussed in Section 3.8.1.1 of this SE (above Concept phase), the licensee identified that
the key vulnerability to the design phase of the Tricon V10 platform was improper manipulation
of the preliminary or detailed design description documentation. If the IOM's procedures do not
properly control the design process, the opportunity exists for insertion of inappropriate features
and/or the omission of required features. During the NRC review of the Tricon V9 platform, the
NRC staff found that the software development process and lifecycle for the Tricon V9 system
was adequate for SR use in nuclear power plants.
The development process for the Tricon V10 system is controlled by the IOM QPM and EDM,
which were previously reviewed and approved by the NRC. For plant-specific configurations
utilizing the Tricon V10, the development process for SR application software will be governed
by the IOM NSIPM.
The NRC staff has determined that the vendor's procedures and processes have adequately
protected the design phase of the system lifecycle from tampering by excluding undocumented
code, malicious code, and other unwanted or undocumented functions or applications and has
met the criterion in Section 2.3.2 of RG 1.152, Revision 3.
3.8.1.4

IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

Regulatory Position 2.4, states that, “In the system (integrated hardware and software)
implementation phase, the system design is transformed into code, database structures, and
related machine executable representations. The implementation activity addresses hardware

– 108 –
configuration and setup; software coding and testing; and communication configuration and
set-up [including the incorporation of reused software and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
products].”
System Features
Regulatory Position 2.4.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states that, “The developer should ensure
that the security design configuration item transformations from the system design specification
are correct, accurate, and complete.”
During the design of the Tricon V10 and TriStation 1131 software, peer reviews are performed
on documents, logic, tests, and other electronic documents to ensure that the contents are
complete, logical, correct, and also that the Tricon and TriStation 1131 designs include only the
required functionality. EDM 40.50 defines the software code review process. The software
design review includes structural walk-through of overall design as well as individual module
design. All requirements must be traceable from the system specification to the design, thus
accounting for hidden functions. This provides reasonable assurance that IOM has minimized
the possibility of inadvertent injection of undesired code into the system and application program
logic. The NRC staff review of this process found it to be acceptable and the December 2010
audit at IOM’s Irvine, California facility (Reference 6) supported the conclusion by directly
verifying requirements traceability.
The NRC staff has reviewed the implementation controls and determined that the Tricon V10
platform has features that comply with the criterion in Section 2.4.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3.
Development Activities
Anti-Tampering Provisions During Implementation
Regulatory Position 2.4.2 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states, “The developer should implement
security procedures and standards to minimize and mitigate tampering with the developed
system. The developer’s standards and procedures should include testing with scanning as
appropriate, to address undocumented codes or malicious functions that might (1) allow
unauthorized access or use of the system or (2) cause systems to behave beyond the system
requirements. The developer should account for hidden functions and vulnerable features
embedded in the code, and their purpose and impact on the safety system. If possible, these
functions should be disabled, removed, or (as a minimum) addressed (e.g., as part of the failure
modes and affects analysis of the application code) to prevent any unauthorized access.”
As discussed in Sections 3.8.1.1, 3.8.1.2, and 3.8.1.3, IOM has implemented security controls
for software development environments, security controls over physical and network access to
Tricon platform source code and build process, including password-based access control,
administrative restrictions on write permissions, and control of source code versions and
protection of record versions in a source-code repository (Synergy). Furthermore, the ability to
embed undesired code in system or application software would require not only access but also
expert knowledge of the programming conventions and tools to avoid immediate detection
through erratic behavior or design measures.
For plant-specific configurations utilizing the Tricon V10, the development process for SR
application software will be controlled under the IOM NSIPM. IOM will work with the Licensee to
identify applicable Tricon V10 security performance requirements that should be incorporated,

– 109 –
and, in accordance with the IOM NSIPM, provide traceability of these requirements into the
plant-specific implementation of the application software.
Configuration control is maintained for Tricon V10 software. Software development is
conducted on development workstations in a controlled environment through authorized project
directories. Review and approval processes are enforced before releasing modified software for
inclusion in Synergy. Only developers with “developer” access control are allowed to add
and/or modify code in Synergy. Only one developer can modify the Tricon V10 code. Changes
to the source code are reviewed by cognizant IOM personnel as outlined in IOM process
document, EDM 40.50.
The development process for the Tricon V10 system is controlled by the IOM QPM and EDM.
In the process of a release of a product, a change impact analysis is performed during which the
new source base is compared to the last source base. Any changes have to be documented
and justified. NTX-SER-10-14 (Reference 35) identifies a vulnerability – “The task of building a
release is currently assigned to one person and there is no secondary verification that the build
included the correct source.” IOM has implemented process changes to mitigate these as
stated in NTX-SER-10-14 (Reference 35). Third party reviewer, TÜV Rheinland, however,
performs source code review which can be credited for the verification of the build because it
occurs before product rollout. The NRC staff finds the newly implemented process is improved
because it occurs before the build is released.
System developer uses TriStation 1131 Developers Workbench to develop the code to be
executed on the Tricon controllers. TriStation 1131 uses password protection that may be
configured to assign different levels of access to multiple users. Thus, every TriStation 1131
operation is assigned a default security level and each user is assigned a security level that
defines what operations a user can perform. Windows security file access rules apply to all
TriStation 1131 project files. If an existing TriStation 1131 project was created by a user with
restricted or administrator-level rights in Windows, other users must have the same access
rights to open that project.
For plant-specific configurations utilizing the Tricon V10, the development process for SR
application software will be governed by the IOM NSIPM. In addition to the NSIPM, the
“Nuclear Delivery Programming Guide,” IOM Document No. 9600380-001, provides guidance
on Tricon V10 application programming for nuclear system integration projects.
Based upon the documented efforts to fully inspect their source code for unwanted code and
features, as well as the controls currently in place to protect the development environment and
developed software products, the NRC staff determined that Tricon V10 platform complies with
Section 2.4.2 of RG 1.152, Revision 3.
Use of Commercial-Off-the-Shelf Systems (COTS)
Regulatory Position 2.4.2 states, “[For Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) systems] unless such
systems are modified by the application developer, the security effort should be limited to
ensuring that the features within the system do not compromise the security requirements of the
system, and the security functions should not be compromised by the other system functions.”
All firmware and TriSTation 1131 software was implemented and tested by IOM personnel, with
the exception of the third party software in the TCM. The third party software was dedicated by
IOM as described in Section 3.2.2. IOM also modified the third party software and performed

– 110 –
significant testing on the TCM as part of their validation and verification process. Further, the
TCM has been used commercially in the Tricon V10 without incident since 2005.
The NRC staff determined that this criterion of Regulatory Position 2.4.2 of RG 1.152,
Revision 3, has been met.
3.8.1.5

TEST PHASE

Section 2.5 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states that, “The objective of testing security functions is to
ensure that the system security requirements are validated by execution of integration, system,
and acceptance tests where practical and necessary. Testing includes system hardware
configuration (including all external connectivity), software integration testing, software
qualification testing, system integration testing, system qualification testing, and system factory
acceptance testing.”
System Features
Section 2.5.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, states that, “The security requirements and configuration
items are part of validation of the overall system requirements and design configuration items.
Therefore, security design configuration items are just one element of the overall system
validation. Each system security feature should be validated to verify that the implemented
system does not increase the risk of security vulnerabilities and does not reduce the reliability of
safety functions.”
IOM EDM requires validation and traceability of all system requirements through design and
testing. IOM performed various tests in their Irvine facility. As mentioned before, the Irvine
Facilities management maintains physical access controls over the Irvine facility. Although the
staging area for system integration testing is located in an open area within the building, it is
part of the greater access controlled area.
The dedication of the operating software and the generic qualification of the Tricon V10 platform
involved an extensive test program that varied from low level single step testing of software
units or components to operability testing for computer qualification of a representative system
configuration. The test subjects ranged from application software objects to software
components to module prototypes to a fully functional representative system (i.e., the test
specimen). Specific tests were implemented to validate the security requirements and
corresponding design features that are identified in the previous sections of this SE.
The testing was controlled by IOM test procedures (see Section 3.2.1 of this SE), which address
the test requirements, performing the tests, and producing the test report. The test procedures
and records are controlled under the IOM configuration management plan, as discussed in
Section 3.2.1 of this SE. Test procedures are maintained in Agile.
The various tests conducted under the qualification program for the Tricon V10 platform are
discussed in Section 3.3 of this SE. The traceability of the tests to the requirements which they
validate is documented in the requirements traceability matrix and associated appendices and
discussed in Section 3.2.1 of this SE.
The NRC staff evaluation of these tests (see Sections 3.2.1 and 3.3 of this SE) also involved
review of the test procedures and assessment of the traceability to requirements. The NRC

– 111 –
staff determined that security-related requirements were validated during these tests and that
this criterion of Regulatory Position 2.5.1 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, has been met.
Development Activities
Regulatory Position 2.5.2 of RG 1.152, Revision 3, specifies, “The developer should configure
and enable the designed security features correctly. The developer should also test the system
hardware architecture, external communication devices, and configurations for unauthorized
pathways and system integrity. Attention should be focused on built-in OEM [original equipment
manufacturer] features.”
As discussed in section 3.8.1.4 of this SE, testing for the Tricon V10 platform operating software
was performed at several different levels. Specifically, testing under the dedication and generic
qualification activities addressed object, component, module, and system functionality. The
results from these tests validated the correct implementation of key security features.
After a system is configured to the customer’s requirements, all of the modules are then
scanned into the system by serial number. A system-level test is then performed in accordance
with Test Procedure 9600051-001. At the end of the test the technician will do a dump of the
firmware that provides a printout that lists each module, its serial number, its location, and the
Meta numbers for all programmed parts.
After testing was completed, IOM uses the System Hierarchy Automated File Transfer (SHAFT)
program to track configuration of the system (e.g., version of the system, modules requested,
etc.) to be installed in a plant specific application. For example, during System Test all firmware
is checked for correct Meta numbers per the configuration called out in the SHAFT configuration
database.
Following review and acceptance for release, source code is to be placed in Synergy to
preclude unauthorized modification. The source code, associated derived products, and design
documentation are to be retained as controlled items in Agile. Manufacturing never ships a
Tricon V10 system with application software installed. Virus Scan is run daily on all
workstations used to execute test programs. Installation of the operating software is
accomplished by downloading through the TCM using a Windows platform running IOM’s
TriStation 1131. Administrative controls will be required when downloading in the operational
environment. Revision and checksum information are embedded into the firmware to serve as
identification. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the identification of the code installed
is correct to avoid inadvertent usage of incorrect software.
For plant-specific configurations utilizing the Tricon V10, the test-phase activities for SR
application software will be controlled under the IOM NSIPM. IOM will work with the licensee to
identify applicable plant-specific security performance requirements that should be incorporated
into the Tricon V10 system, and, in accordance with the NSIPM, provide traceability of these
requirements through testing and V&V of plant-specific application software. The NRC staff has
not reviewed the NSPIM, as stated in Section 2.1 of this SE.
Based upon the defined testing procedures and the measures taken to verify correct software
installation, the NRC staff determined that IOM has mitigated the potential for unauthorized
versions of the Tricon V10 platform software to be released. The NRC staff concluded that IOM
has met the criteria of Section 2.5.2 of RG 1.152, Revision 3.

DIVERSITY AND DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH

The Staff Requirements Memorandum on SECY 93-087, dated July 21, 1993, describes the
NRC position on diversity and defense-in-depth (D3) requirements to compensate for potential
common-cause programming failure. This requires that the applicant assess the D3 of the
proposed instrumentation and control system, and if a postulated common cause failure (CCF)
could disable a safety function, then a diverse means, with a documented basis that the diverse
means is unlikely to be subject to the same CCF, shall be required to perform either the same
function or a different function.
Guidance on the evaluation of D3 is provided in SRP BTP 7-19. In addition, NUREG/CR-6303,
“Method for Performing Diversity and Defense-in-Depth Analyses of Reactor Protection
Systems,” dated December 31, 1994, summarizes several D3 analyses performed after 1990
and presents a method for performing such analyses.
Additional guidance on evaluation of the need for D3, and acceptable methods for implementing
the required D3 in DI&C system designs, is contained in “Interim Staff Guidance, Digital
Instrumentation and Controls, DI&C-ISG-02 Task Working Group #2: Diversity and
Defense-in-Depth Issues.”
Since both diversity and defense-in-depth are plant specific topics, the LTR did not address
these topics, and therefore are not within the scope of this SE. Sections 3.6.2 and 3.6.3 of
Appendix B, "Applications Guide," to IOM Document No. 7286-545-1 (Reference 4), provides
guidance in the preparation of a plant specific D3 evaluation. A review of the differences
between the Tricon V10 system and the safety/non-safety control system and indications
implemented at a particular nuclear power plant, and the determination that plant specific
required diversity and defense-in-depth continue to be maintained must be addressed in a
plant-specific D3 evaluation. Thus, the performance of a plant-specific D3 analysis is an ASAI
for SR applications of the Tricon V10 platform. These determinations will be reviewed during
the plant-specific safety evaluation.
3.10 CONFORMANCE WITH IEEE STD 603-1991
For nuclear power generating stations, 10 CFR 50.55a(h) requires that safety systems must
meet the requirements stated in IEEE Std 603-1991, “IEEE Standard Criteria for Safety
Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations” and the correction sheet dated January 30,
1995. The subsections below document the evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against those
regulatory requirements. The generic SRP acceptance criteria contained in NUREG-0800,
Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, “Guidance for Evaluation of Conformance to IEEE Std 603,” were
used in evaluating conformance of the Tricon V10 platform with the applicable IEEE
Std 603-1991 requirements. This evaluation supports conclusions regarding adherence of the
Tricon V10 platform to the relevant regulatory requirements.
IEEE Std 603-1991 is written from a system perspective, which defines criteria (i.e., contains
requirements) that a safety system must meet. The evaluation documented below is performed
in accordance with this system perspective. Consistent with accepted industry guidance on
generic qualification of PLCs, the LTR documents evidence that the Tricon V10 PLC platform is
suitable for use in SR applications rather than present a complete safety system design.
Consequently, it is not possible to provide a complete assessment of conformance with system
requirements on the basis of the platform alone. In the absence of a specific system design for
a particular SR application, the determination of conformance with the IEEE Std 603-1991

– 113 –
requirements is necessarily limited to the evaluation of features and characteristics of the
platform that support fulfillment of system requirements. Thus, this evaluation addresses the
capabilities and qualifications of the platform that are relevant in assuring that a safety system
based on the Tricon V10 platform satisfies regulatory requirements.
IEEE Std 603-1991 contains five clauses (Clause 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), described in the five major
subsections below, that must be considered in the evaluation of the platform.
Each of these major subsections contains subordinate subsections that address the individually
identifiable requirements of these clauses. Consideration is given to the degree to which each
requirement can be evaluated in whole or in part within the scope of a platform review. While a
number of the requirements cannot be assessed or cannot be assessed fully on the basis of the
platform, each of the main requirements of IEEE Std 603-1991 is presented. This evaluation
provides a means for subsequent plant specific submittals to account for those elements of
review that are contained in this document.
3.10.1

IEEE 603-1991 CLAUSE 4, “SAFETY SYSTEM DESIGNATION”

Clause 4 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that a specific basis shall be established for the design of
each safety system of the nuclear power generating station. The sub-clauses of this
requirement can be characterized as follows:
Clause 4.1
Clause 4.2
Clause 4.3
Clause 4.4
Clause 4.5
Clause 4.6
Clause 4.7
Clause 4.8
Clause 4.9
Clause 4.10
Clause 4.11
Clause 4.12

Identification of the Design Basis Events
Safety Functions and Corresponding Protective Actions
Permissive Conditions for Each Operating Bypass Capability
Identification of Variables Monitored
Minimum Criteria for Manual Initiation and Control Of Protective Actions
Identification of the Minimum Number and Location Of Sensors
Range Of Transient and Steady State Conditions
Identification of Conditions Which May Degrade Performance
The Methods to Be Used To Determine Reliability
The Critical Points in Time After The Onset Of A Design Basis Event
The Equipment Protective Provisions
Any Other Special Design Basis

SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 4, “Safety System Designation” provides acceptance
criteria for these requirements.
The determination and documentation of the design basis for a safety system is an
application-specific activity that is dependent on the plant design. Since the LTR does not
address a specific application of the platform, the design basis for a safety system is not
available for review and no evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against these regulatory
requirements could be performed. Nevertheless, in regard to Clause 4.9, a platform-level
assessment of reliability was performed by IOM and the analysis is reviewed in Section 3.6 of
this SE. Based on the NRC staff's review of this analysis, IOM used an acceptable method to
perform this reliability analysis (IEEE Std 352-1987).
3.10.2

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5, “SAFETY SYSTEM CRITERIA”

Clause 5 of IEEE Std 603-1991 requires that safety systems maintain plant parameters, with
precision and reliability, within acceptable limits established for each design basis event. The

– 114 –
power, instrumentation and control portions of each safety system are required to be comprised
of more than one safety group (or division) of which any one safety group can accomplish the
safety function. The establishment of a safety group that can accomplish a given safety function
is an application-specific activity. Since the LTR does not address a specific application, the
evaluation against the following regulatory requirements addresses the capabilities and
characteristics of the Tricon V10 platform that are relevant for adherence to each requirement.
3.10.2.1 IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.1, “SINGLE FAILURE CRITERION”
Clause 5.1 of IEEE Std 603-1991 requires that the safety system be able to perform its safety
function required for a design basis event in the presence of: (1) any single detectable failure
within the safety systems concurrent with all identifiable, but non-detectable, failures, (2) all
failures caused by the single failure, and (3) all failures and spurious system actions that cause
or are caused by the design basis event requiring the safety functions. SRP Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.1, “Single Failure Criterion,” provides acceptance criteria for the
single failure criterion. In addition, RG 1.53, “Application of the Single-Failure Criterion to Safety
Systems,” endorses IEEE Std 379-2000, “Application of the Single-Failure Criterion to Nuclear
Power Generating Station Safety Systems,” as providing an acceptable method for satisfying
this requirement.
Determination that no single failure within the safety system can prevent required protective
actions at the system level is an application-specific activity that requires an assessment of a full
system design. A platform-level assessment can only address those features and capabilities
that support adherence to the single failure criterion by a system design based on the platform.
Since the LTR does not address a specific application for approval, the evaluation against this
requirement is limited to consideration of the means provided within the platform to address
failures.
As discussed in Section 3.5 of this SE, the NRC staff reviewed the Tricon V10 FMEA and
determined that the analysis provides a thorough assessment of the potential failure modes and
the effect of those failures based on a generic reference system composed of a single Tricon
V10 platform. The FMEA concludes that there are no undetectable single failures of the
platform based on the use of redundancy, diagnostics and self-tests as means of failure
detection and indication. The NRC staff finds that the FMEA supports a conclusion that the
Tricon V10 platform is suitable for use in SR applications in a nuclear power plant. The analysis
and results of the FMEA for the Tricon V10 platform can be incorporated into
application-specific FMEAs for system designs based on the platform.
The use of redundancy at the platform level (triple modular redundant processors) supplements
the conventional use of redundancy at the system level to satisfy the single failure criterion. The
Tricon V10 platform provides diagnostic and self-test capabilities to detect and enable indication
of hardware faults and module component failures during power up and runtime as described in
IOM Document No. 9600164-531 (Reference 28). These platform-level capabilities satisfy
Clause 5.1 by providing the means to detect postulated component failures.
3.10.2.2

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.2, “COMPLETION OF PROTECTIVE ACTION”

Clause 5.2 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that the safety systems shall be designed so that, once
initiated automatically or manually, the intended sequence of protective actions of the execute
features shall continue until completion, and that deliberate operator action shall be required to

– 115 –
return the safety systems to normal. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.2, “Completion
of Protective Action,” provides acceptance criteria for this requirement.
Determination that protective actions of the execute features of a safety system will continue to
completion after initiation is an application-specific activity that requires an assessment of a full
system design. Since the LTR does not address a specific application and the scope of the
platform does not include execute features for a safety system, no evaluation of the Tricon V10
platform against this regulatory requirement could be performed.
3.10.2.3

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.3, “QUALITY”

Clause 5.3 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that the components and modules within the safety
system must be of a quality that is consistent with minimum maintenance requirements and low
failure rates, and that safety system equipment be designed, manufactured, inspected, installed,
tested, operated, and maintained in accordance with a prescribed QA program. SRP Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.3, “Quality,” provides acceptance criteria for the quality requirement.
This acceptance criteria states that the QA provisions of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, apply to a
safety system.
GDC 1 states that structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be designed,
fabricated, erected, and tested to quality standards commensurate with the importance of the
safety functions to be performed. Where generally recognized codes and standards are used,
they shall be identified and evaluated to determine their applicability, adequacy, and sufficiency
and shall be supplemented or modified as necessary to assure a quality product in keeping with
the required safety function. A QA program shall be established and implemented in order to
provide adequate assurance that these structures, systems, and components will satisfactorily
perform their safety functions. Appropriate records of the design, fabrication, erection, and
testing of structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be maintained by or
under the control of the nuclear power unit licensee throughout the life of the unit.
The regulation at 10 CFR 50.55a(a)(1), “Quality Standards,” requires that the “structures,
systems, and components must be designed, fabricated, erected, constructed, tested, and
inspected to quality standards commensurate with the importance of the safety function to be
performed.”
The current processes and procedures contained in the IOM QAM, QPM, and EDM documents
have previously been audited by the Nuclear Procurement Issues Committee (NUPIC). As a
consequence of the most recent audits performed in May 2010, IOM is a qualified supplier of
Class 1E nuclear safety systems.
The Tricon V10 product line is based on a foundation of products that were designed for
commercial grade industrial systems, rather than specifically for use in SR systems in nuclear
power plants. As a result, the design process that led to the Tricon V10 platform was not
governed by Appendix B of 10 CFR Part 50. The Tricon V10 platform has undergone
commercial grade dedication (by IOM) of its system software and been subjected to Class 1E
equipment qualification (see Sections 3.2.1 and 3.3, respectively, of this SE). The platform is
now maintained under a software QA program that satisfies the requirements of Appendix B in
all aspects of the product life cycle going forward with regard to the Tricon V10 platform
(Reference 48), including the design control process, purchasing, fabricating, handling,
shipping, storing, building, inspecting, testing, operating, maintaining, repairing, and modifying

– 116 –
the platform. As such, the Tricon V10 platform hardware and software is designed for Class 1 E
equipment applications at nuclear power plants.
Application software and its specific life cycle processes are outside the scope of this review
and will be reviewed in plant-specific reviews. The operating software and communications
module software are commercial grade PDS that was dedicated by IOM using their CGD
procedure, EDM 76.00 (Reference 18). As stated previously in this SE (Sections 3.2.1 and 3.7)
the NRC staff reviewed these CGD activities and based on the review of the associated
development history, operating experience, life cycle design output documentation, and testing
and review activities, the NRC staff finds the dedication evidence for the PDS of the Tricon V10
platform to be acceptable for demonstrating built-in quality. In addition, the NRC staff
determined that the IOM QA processes for software maintenance provides reasonable
assurance that the quality characteristics of the PDS can be preserved. Consequently, the NRC
staff concludes that the Tricon V10 hardware and software is of sufficient quality to satisfy
Clause 5.3 and is suitable for use in SR applications.
3.10.2.4

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.4, “EQUIPMENT QUALIFICATION”

Clause 5.4 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that safety system equipment be qualified by type test,
previous operating experience, or analysis, or any combination of these three methods, to
substantiate that it will be capable of meeting the performance requirements as specified in the
design basis. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.4, “Equipment Qualification” provides
acceptance criteria for IEEE Std 603-1991 Clause 5.4. This acceptance criteria states that the
applicant/licensee should confirm that the safety system equipment is designed to meet the
functional performance requirements over the range of normal environmental conditions for the
area in which it is located. This clause of IEEE Std 603-1991 also states that qualification of
Class 1E equipment be in accordance with the requirements of IEEE Std 323-1983 and IEEE
Std 627-1980, “IEEE Standard for Design Qualification of Safety Systems Equipment Used in
Nuclear Power Generating Stations.” RG 1.89 endorses and provides guidance on compliance
with IEEE Std 323-1974 for qualification of SR electrical equipment installed in harsh
environment locations (i.e., locations subject to design basis-accident conditions). RG 1.209
endorses and provides guidance for compliance with IEEE Std 323-2003 for qualification of SR
computer-based I&C systems installed in mild environment locations.
EPRI TR-107330 was used to establish the bases for the Tricon V10 platform equipment
qualification. As such, it consists of the maximum (i.e., extremes) environmental and service
conditions for which qualification was validated and the range of performance characteristics for
the PLC that were demonstrated under exposure to environmental stress conditions.
Subsequent plant-specific applications are obligated to verify that the qualification envelope
provided by qualification to the guidance of EPRI TR-107330 bounds the requirements of the
application.
The environmental qualification program for the new/modified components for the Tricon V10
platform addressed the generic qualification envelope that is specified in EPRI TR-107330. The
evaluation of the environmental qualification that was demonstrated is contained in Section 3.3
of this SE. Based on that evaluation, the NRC staff determined that an acceptable qualification
envelope for the Tricon V10 platform was demonstrated for radiation, temperature and humidity,
seismic withstand, electromagnetic capability (EMC), electrical fast transient response, power
surge withstand, electrostatic discharge, and Class 1E to Non-Class 1E isolation capabilities for
use in SR application in nuclear power plants, and satisfies this clause. However, the NRC staff
concludes that some EQ tests (e.g., EMC qualification of the Tricon V10 platform for radiated

– 117 –
magnetic field, low frequency conducted interference, and high frequency conducted
interference emissions) have been demonstrated, up to the respective EQ limitations noted in
Section 3.3 of this SE. It remains as an ASAI to verify that the generic equipment qualification
envelope for the Tricon V10 platform, as approved by this SE, bounds the corresponding
plant-specific conditions for these environmental stressors and that the performance
characteristics demonstrated for the Tricon V10 platform under the tested service conditions are
adequate for the specific application. Furthermore, applications of the Tricon V10 platform at
nuclear power plants should verify that the equipment qualification limitations observed during
testing (as noted in Section 3.3 of this SE) are adequate for the specific application, or
additional EQ testing should be performed to address this ASAI.
3.10.2.5 IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.5, “SYSTEM INTEGRITY”
Clause 5.5 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that the safety systems be designed such that the
system can accomplish its safety functions under the full range of applicable conditions
enumerated in the design basis. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.5, “System
Integrity,” provides acceptance criteria for system integrity. This guidance on acceptance
criteria states that the NRC staff should confirm that tests have been conducted on safety
system equipment components and the system racks and panels as a whole to demonstrate
that the safety system performance is adequate to ensure completion of protective actions over
the range of transient and steady state conditions of both the energy supply and the
environment. Furthermore, the NRC staff should confirm that if tests show that the system does
fail, it fails in a safe state. Also, the NRC staff should verify that failures detected by
self-diagnostics also place a protective function into a safe state. Finally, confirmation that
system real-time performance is adequate to ensure completion of protective action within
critical time frames is identified as a special concern for digital computer-based systems.
Determination of system integrity is an application-specific activity that requires an assessment
of a full system design. A platform-level assessment can only address those characteristics that
can support fulfillment of this requirement by a system design based on the platform. Since the
LTR does not address a specific application or establish a definitive safety system design, the
evaluation against this requirement is limited to consideration of the integrity demonstrated by
the platform and its features to assure a safe state can be achieved in the presence of failures.
While the evaluation indicates the suitability of the platform to contribute to satisfying this
requirement, a plant-specific evaluation is necessary to establish full conformance with
Clause 5.5.
As discussed above and in Section 3.3 of this SE, the Tricon V10 platform underwent testing to
demonstrate qualification for installation in mild environment locations in a nuclear power plant.
Pending satisfactory resolution of the equipment limitations in certain environmental qualification
testing as noted in Section 3.3 of this SE, the IOM qualification program provides reasonable
assurance that SR systems based on the Tricon V10 platform will be capable of performing
safety functions over the full range of environmental stressors that correspond to those
expected worst case design basis events bounded by the qualification envelope for the Tricon
V10 platform.
As described in Section 3.5 of this SE, IOM performed a failure modes and effects analysis
(FMEA) on the Tricon V10 platform. The NRC staff reviewed the FMEA (Reference 28) to
confirm that if the system does fail, it fails in a safe state. Failure mechanisms that affect a
single leg of the triple-redundant system generally have no effect on system operation,
therefore, the FMEA also considered (1) failure mechanisms that are recognized as being highly

– 118 –
unlikely but could affect multiple components, and (2) the coincident occurrence of otherwise
single failures (i.e., multiple failures). The results of the analysis show that, in general, failure
modes that could prevent a Tricon V10 system from performing its safety function are detected
by the built-in system diagnostics or by periodic testing. Also, the NRC staff concludes that the
system is designed to fail into a safe mode.
The evaluation of response time and deterministic performance is discussed in Sections 3.4.1
and 3.4.2 of this SE. Although the Tricon V10 platform did not satisfy the response time criteria
from EPRI TR-107330 for the test specimen executing the TSAP application, the platform did
demonstrate credible response time characteristics that are suitable to support SR applications
and satisfy the criteria of this clause at the platform level. The actual response times for
particular safety functions are application specific and acceptable performance depends on the
system design and safety function requirements. Thus, it is an ASAI to confirm the suitability of
the response time characteristics of the Tricon V10 platform for particular safety functions and to
demonstrate acceptable response times for each combination of input and output modules and
system configurations that are relevant to the specific design. Consequently, evaluation for full
conformance against this portion of the acceptance criteria remains for a plant-specific review.
Based on the review items discussed above, the NRC staff finds that the integrity characteristics
(e.g., response time, deterministic performance, failure detection and response, fault tolerance,
environmental withstand) of the Tricon V10 platform, when appropriately implemented, are
suitable for SR applications at nuclear power plants and satisfy Clause 5.5 for the platform.
3.10.2.6

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.6, “INDEPENDENCE”

Clause 5.6 of IEEE Std 603-1991 requires in part independence between: (1) redundant
portions of a safety system, (2) safety systems and the effects of design basis events, and (3)
safety systems and other systems. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.6,
“Independence” provides acceptance criteria for system integrity. This acceptance criteria
states that three aspects of independence: (1) physical independence, (2) electrical
independence, and (3) communications independence, should be addressed for each of the
previously listed cases. Guidance for evaluation of physical and electrical independence is
provided in RG 1.75, Revision 3, “Criteria for Independence of Electrical Safety Systems,” which
endorses IEEE Std 384-1992, “IEEE Standard Criteria for Independence of Class 1E Equipment
and Circuits.” The safety system design should not have components that are common to
redundant portions of the safety system, such as common switches for actuation, reset, mode,
or test; common sensing lines; or any other features that could compromise the independence
of redundant portions of the safety system. Physical independence is attained by physical
separation and physical barriers. Electrical independence should include the utilization of
separate power sources. Transmission of signals between independent channels should be
through isolation devices.
SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.6, “Independence,” provides additional acceptance
criteria for communications independence. Section 5.6 states that where data communication
exists between different portions of a safety system, the analysis should confirm that a logical or
software malfunction in one portion cannot affect the safety functions of the redundant portions,
and that if a digital computer system used in a safety system is connected to a digital computer
system used in a non-safety system, a logical or software malfunction of the non-safety system
must not be able to affect the functions of the safety system.

– 119 –
Establishing independence for a safety system is an application-specific activity that requires an
assessment of a full system design. Since the LTR does not address a specific application or
establish a definitive safety system design, the evaluation against this requirement is limited to
consideration of the means provided within the platform to promote independence. The Tricon
V10 platform provides features to address electrical and communications independence.
Physical independence is solely dependent on the design and implementation of the full safety
system.
Independence between redundant portions of a safety system is addressed in Sections 3.1.2.8
and 3.7.1 of this SE. IOM has developed a Communication Application Safety Layer for SR
communication between external processors (e.g., redundant channel Tricon V10 platforms)
and the Tricon V10 system. This is an additional layer of protection provided by the
communication protocols at the Application Layer of the network stack. The P2P and SAP
protocols ensure end-to-end integrity of safety-critical messages. System architectures
requiring data transfer between SR Tricons over a network would use the P2P protocol over an
electrically and data isolated, point-to-point network. Architectures requiring safety-critical data
exchange with SR video display units would utilize the SAP.
Independence between the SR Tricon V10 platform and other NSR systems is discussed in
Sections 3.1.2.3 and 3.7.2 of this SE. There are two means of digital communications provided
between the Tricon V10 platform and other NSR systems: Communications via the TCM and
communications with RXMs.
Communications with NSR systems via the TCM is implemented in the same manner as
described above for SR inter-channel communications, except the communications protocol
would be different. However, electrical isolation is still accomplished via fiber optic
communication links between the Tricon V10 and the NSR system. Data isolation between the
Tricon V10 platform and the NSR systems is accomplished via communications through the
IOCCOM processor and using dual ported RAM as a buffer as discussed in Section 3.7 of this
SE.
Communications with NSR systems via remote extender chassis/modules extend the Tricon
V10 PLC I/O bus to allow communications with the main chassis and expansion chassis. The
RXMs are single-mode fiber optic modules that also provide ground loop isolation, which are
suitable Class 1E to Non-Class 1E isolators between a SR main chassis and a NSR expansion
chassis. Data isolation between the Tricon V10 platform and the NSR RXMs is accomplished
via communications through the IOCCOM processor and using dual ported RAM as a buffer as
discussed in Section 3.7 of this SE.
Therefore, on the basis of the electrical isolation design features of the TCM and RXM modules
(as described in this SE), the NRC staff concludes that the electrical isolation provided between
the Tricon V10 platform and attached systems/equipment via these modules satisfy the
electrical independence requirement of Clause 5.6. Section 3.1.2.6 of this SE discusses the
use of interposing processors (IOCCOM) to buffer the execution of the safety function by the
MP (3008N) from the management of communications transactions via the TCM and RXMs.
Section 3.7 of this SE addresses the evaluation of communications independence with respect
to the guidance in DI&C-ISG-04. The NRC staff has determined that the platform
communication capabilities of the Tricon V10 platform provide features that support
communications independence, but the specific interconnections defined in an application must
be determined and evaluated in an application-specific review. Thus, the review items cited
above indicate provisions for electrical isolation and communications circuitry and protocols to

– 120 –
promote communications independence. Consequently, the NRC staff concludes that the
Tricon V10 platform complies with the electrical and communications provisions of Clause 5.6 at
the platform level.
3.10.2.7

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.7, “CAPABILITY FOR TEST AND CALIBRATION”

Clause 5.7 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that the safety system shall have the capability for test
and calibration while retaining the capability to accomplish its safety function, and that this
capability be provided during power operation and shall duplicate, as closely as practicable,
performance of the safety function. This clause further states that the testing of Class 1E
systems be in accordance with the requirements of IEEE Std 338-1987. Exceptions to testing
and calibration during power operation are allowed where this capability cannot be provided
without adversely affecting the safety or operability of the generating station; however,
appropriate justification must be provided; acceptable reliability of equipment operation must be
demonstrated; and the capability shall be provided while the generating station is shut down.
SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.7, “Capability for Test and Calibration,” provides
acceptance criteria for IEEE Std 603-1991 Clause 5.7. First, it states that guidance on periodic
testing of the safety system is provided in RG 1.22, “Periodic Testing of Protection System
Actuation Functions,” and in RG 1.118, Revision 3, “Periodic Testing of Electric Power and
Protection Systems,” that endorses IEEE Std 338-1987. Section 5.7 acceptance criteria states
that periodic testing should duplicate, as closely as practical, the overall performance required
of the safety system, and that the test should confirm operability of both the automatic and
manual circuitry. This capability should be provided to permit testing during power operation
and that when this capability can only be achieved by overlapping tests, the test scheme must
be such that the tests do, in fact, overlap from one test segment to another. Section 5.7 further
states that test procedures that require disconnecting wires, installing jumpers, or other similar
modifications of the installed equipment are not acceptable test procedures for use during
power operation. Section 5.7 further states that for digital computer based systems, test
provisions should address the increased potential for subtle system failures such as data errors
and computer lockup.
The regulation at 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A, GDC 21, “Protection system reliability and
testability,” requires in part that the protection system be designed for in-service testability
commensurate with the safety functions to be performed. It also requires a design that permits
periodic testing of its functioning when the reactor is in operation, including the capability to test
channels independently to determine failures and losses of redundancy that may have occurred.
The regulation at 10 CFR 50.36(c)(3), “Technical specifications,” states that surveillance
requirements are requirements relating to test, calibration, or inspection to assure that the
necessary quality of systems and components is maintained, that facility operation will be within
safety limits, and that the limiting conditions for operation will be met. RG 1.53, “Application of
the Single-Failure Criterion to Safety Systems,” which endorses IEEE Std 379-2000, “IEEE
Standard Application of the Single-Failure Criterion to Nuclear Power Generating Station Safety
Systems,” states that the protection system must be capable of accomplishing the required
protective function in the presence of any single detectable failure concurrent with all
identifiable, but non-detectable, failures. Consequently, self-testing and periodic testing are
important elements in the design's ability to meet the single-failure criterion. SRP BTP 7-17
describes additional considerations in the evaluation of test provisions in digital computer based
systems.

– 121 –
Determination of the test and calibration requirements that must be fulfilled depends upon the
plant-specific safety requirements (e.g., accuracy) that apply. In addition, the establishment of
the types of surveillance necessary for the safety system to ensure detection of identifiable
single failures that are only announced through testing is an application-specific activity as well.
Since the LTR does not address a specific application or establish a definitive safety system
design, the evaluation against this requirement is limited to consideration of the means provided
within the platform to enable testing and calibration for a redundant portion of a safety system
(i.e., channel).
The Tricon V10 FMEA (see Section 3.5 of this SE) provided a systematic analysis of a
representative (single-channel) system based on the Tricon V10 platform to determine the effect
on the system (i.e., platform) of credible single failures. For each postulated failure mode, the
FMEA determined ways in which the failure could be detected via platform automated
diagnostics and self-testing. Diagnostics and self-test capabilities of the Tricon V10 platform are
described in Section 3.4.3 of this SE. The level of diagnostic self-test capabilities of new
modules in the Tricon V10 platform, including the 3008N MP module, is similar to the level of
capabilities reviewed on the Tricon V9 platform. The NRC staff determined the diagnostic selftest capabilities are thorough and provide automatic detection of most identified failure modes at
the platform level. The diagnostics are integrated into the Tricon V10 operating system software
and data is made available to the application program concerning program operation, results of
arithmetic operations, and other internal faults. Thus, requirements imposed on the application
program relating to error detection are limited to providing appropriate error recovery and
annunciation of faults. IOM also performs fault detection verification testing that verifies fault
detection capabilities of the platform. Faults were injected into a live card connected to an
operational Tricon V10 platform via extender cables. Faults were assessed through a
maintenance terminal connected to a TCM module in the main chassis. The LTR describes
acceptable use of software watchdog timers, memory checks, processing time checks,
communications checks, and other tests in each type of component (or module) as appropriate
to verify normal operation and detection of potential subtle system failures such as data errors
and computer lockup (see Sections 3.4.3, 3.1.2.7, and 3.1.3.1 of this SE).
The Tricon V10 diagnostic and self-test features satisfy this requirement for test and calibration
capabilities and are acceptable at the platform level. These capabilities may be cited in support
of specific applications. Furthermore, the testing and calibration capabilities of the Tricon V10
platform have been demonstrated to be in compliance with RG 1.22, RG 1.118, and IEEE
Std 338. The capability exists to permit testing of redundant channels during power operation.
The design does not require disconnecting wires, installing jumpers, or otherwise modifying the
installed equipment. Therefore, the Tricon V10 platform conforms to the requirements of
Clause 5.7.
3.10.2.8

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.8, “INFORMATION DISPLAYS”

Clause 5.8 of IEEE Std 603-1991 has four sub-clauses, 5.8.1, “Displays for Manually Controlled
Actions,” 5.8.2, “System Status Indication,” 5.8.3, “Indication of Bypasses,” and 5.8.4,
“Location.” Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.8, “Information Displays,” provides acceptance criteria for
IEEE Std 603, Clause 5.8. This guidance states that the information displays for manually
controlled actions should include confirmation that displays will be functional, and that safety
system bypass and inoperable status indication should conform to the guidance of RG 1.47,
“Bypassed and Inoperable Status Indication for Nuclear Power Plant Safety Systems.”

– 122 –
The design and location of information displays and operator workstations is an application
specific activity. Since the LTR does not address a specific application nor include display
devices permanently connected to the V10 platform (other than local platform LEDs) within the
scope of the platform, no evaluation against this regulatory requirement could be performed.
3.10.2.9

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.9, “CONTROL OF ACCESS”

Clause 5.9 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that the safety system must be designed to permit
administrative control of access to safety system equipment. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C,
Section 5.9, “Control of Access,” provides acceptance criteria for IEEE Std 601-1991,
Clause 5.10. This acceptance criteria states that administrative control is acceptable to assure
that the access to the means for bypassing safety system functions is limited to qualified plant
personnel and that permission of the control room operator is obtained to gain access, and that
digital computer based systems need to consider controls over electronic access, including
access via network connections and maintenance equipment, to safety system software and
data.
Establishing the particular approach for control of access to safety system equipment is an
application-specific activity that depends on the system design. Physical access mechanisms
depend on the specific implementation. The extent and nature of authorized human-system
interactions depend on the allocation of function, operations and maintenance procedures, and
human-machine interface capabilities addressed in a safety system design. In addition, the
communication interconnections that may be provided between the safety system and other
safety related or non-safety systems or equipment are generally dependent on the application.
Since the LTR does not address a specific application, the evaluation against this requirement is
limited to consideration of the means provided within the platform to control access to both
hardware and software.
As described in Section 3.1.2.1 of this SE, the main chassis has a key switch that sets the
following system operating modes:
•
•
•
•

RUN – Normal operation with read-only capability by externally connected systems,
including TriStation. Normally, the switch is set to this position and the key is removed
and stored in a secure location.
PROGRAM – Allows for control of the Tricon V10 system using an externally connected
PC running the TriStation software, including application program downloads.
STOP – Stops application program execution.
REMOTE – Allows writes to application program variables by a TriStation PC or by
MODBUS masters and external hosts.

The Tricon V10 is a modular, rack mounted platform that is housed in cabinets. However, the
cabinets themselves are not identified as part of the base platform and thus are not within the
scope of this review. Consequently, the mechanisms for physical access control cannot be
evaluated in this review.
Although the Tricon V10 product line includes display and peripheral component (e.g., operator
work stations) interface modules that can support online human-system interactions via the
TCM, these modules are not within the scope of the platform under review. As submitted for
review, the base architecture does contain provisions for external communication to the Tricon
V10 platform across via the TCM by other devices (e.g., operator or testing/maintenance

– 123 –
workstations). However, control of electronic access through provisions associated with HMIs is
not within the scope of the LTR and cannot be evaluated in this review.
Application programming is generated using the TriStation 1131 Developer’s Workbench, which
runs on a standard PC. The TriStation 1131 serves as a maintenance workstation that supports
the offline, out-of-service management (i.e., develops application programs and download those
applications to the target Tricon V10 processor) of application software. The TriStation 1131 PC
does not perform SR functions and would not normally be connected while the Tricon V10 is
performing safety critical functions. However, it is physically possible for the TriStation PC to be
connected at other times, and this should be prevented or controlled in such a manner so that
the TriStation tool cannot affect the safety functions of the Tricon PLC via administrative control.
Any such connection that may be established in a specific application would require additional
review.
The NRC staff has evaluated the Tricon V10 platform features to provide control of access and
finds that they are sufficient at the platform level. While the evaluation indicates the suitability of
the platform to contribute to satisfying this requirement, a plant-specific evaluation is necessary
to establish full conformance with Clause 5.9.
3.10.2.10 IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.10, “REPAIR”
Clause 5.10 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that safety systems must be designed to facilitate
timely recognition, location, replacement, repair, and adjustment of malfunctioning equipment.
SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.10, “Repair” provides acceptance criteria for IEEE
Std 601-1991 Clause 5.10. This acceptance criteria states that while digital safety systems may
include self-diagnostic capabilities to aid in troubleshooting, the use of self-diagnostics does not
replace the need for the capability for test and calibration systems as required by Clauses 5.7
and 6.5 of IEEE Std 603-1991.
The timely identification and location of malfunctioning Tricon V10 components is facilitated by
platform and application-specific (hardware and software) features. Any diagnostic and self-test
functions developed as part of the application software are outside the scope of this evaluation
and will be evaluated in an application-specific review. The majority of Tricon V10 hardware is
rack mounted and is replaced rather than repaired, which greatly facilitates timely repair. The
Tricon V10 is triple redundant from input terminal to output terminal, as shown in Figure 2-2.
The triple modular redundant (TMR) architecture is designed to allow continued system
operation in the presence of any single point of failure within the system. The TMR architecture
is also intended to allow the Tricon to detect and correct individual faults on-line, without
interruption of monitoring, control, and protection capabilities. The Tricon V10 boards contain
board-edge LEDs to provide a visual indication of functional status of the platform hardware and
software. In the presence of a fault, the Tricon V10 will alarm the condition, remove the affected
portion of the faulted module from operation, and continue to function normally in a dual
redundant mode. The affected module can be replaced and the system returns to the fully triple
redundant mode of operation. To facilitate module replacement, the Tricon chassis includes
provisions for a spare module, logically paired with a single input or output module. This design
allows on-line, hot replacement of any module, under power while the system is running, with no
impact on the operation of the application.
The platform software for the Tricon V10 includes diagnostic and self-test functions (see
Section 3.4.3 of this SE). The Tricon V10 FMEA identifies failure modes that are automatically
detected by diagnostic and self-test functions.

– 124 –
Based on the provision of automatic diagnostics and self-tests to detect and identify most
failures of the platform, the NRC staff evaluation finds that the Tricon V10 platform complies
with the requirements of Clause 5.10. However, it is necessary for an application-specific
design to provide additional diagnostics or testing functions either as part of the application or
as manually-conducted testing to address those system-level failures that are identified as
detectable only through periodic surveillance. Thus, a plant-specific review would be necessary
to address physical configuration and plant-specific installation conditions that impact safety
system maintenance or to evaluate any necessary diagnostic, testing, or surveillance functions
implemented in application software.
3.10.2.11 IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.11, “IDENTIFICATION”
Clause 5.11 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that (1) safety system equipment shall be distinctly
identified for each redundant portion of a safety system in accordance with the requirements of
IEEE Std 384-1981, “IEEE Standard Criteria for Independence of Class 1E Equipment and
Circuits,” and IEEE Std 420-1982, “IEEE Standard for the Design and Qualification of Class 1E
Control Boards, Panels, and Racks Used in Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” (2)
identification of safety system equipment shall be distinguishable from any identifying markings
placed on equipment for other purposes, (3) identification of safety system equipment and its
divisional assignment shall not require frequent use of reference material, and (4) the
associated documentation shall be distinctly identified in accordance with the requirements of
IEEE Std 494-1974 (R1990), “IEEE Standard Method for Identification of Documents Related to
Class 1E Equipment and Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations.” Clause 5.11 further
states that components or modules mounted in equipment or assemblies that are clearly
identified as being in a single redundant portion of a safety system do not themselves require
identification. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.11, “Identification,” provides
acceptance criteria for Clause 5.11 and cites the guidance in RG 1.75, “Criteria for
Independence of Electric Systems,” which endorses IEEE Std 384-1992, “IEEE Standard
Criteria for Independence of Class 1E Equipment and Circuits.”
Identification of cabinets and cabling for a safety system is an application-specific activity. In
addition, the particular means for identifying safety equipment according to redundant portions
of a safety system (i.e., channels or divisions) is an application-specific activity. However,
component identification for the Tricon V10 platform can contribute to fulfillment of this
requirement. The IOM QA Program Manual defines requirements for the identification and
control of items and provides procedures for establishing and maintaining system configuration
management (Reference 49). Under its Configuration Management Program, IOM has
established labeling, tracking and record keeping practices and capabilities to control the
identification of components. In addition to faceplate identification of module type, IOM provides
physical labels on the printed circuit board of each module to uniquely identify the hardware
module and installed firmware. As part of the regulatory audits conducted at the IOM facility
(Reference 6), the NRC staff observed component identification based on the physical labels
applied to representative modules. Software identification includes version, revision and
maintenance identifiers (e.g., V10.5.1) as described in EDM 24.00, “Software Configuration and
Change Control.” EDM 25.00, “Hardware Identification,” describes the identification of
components and sub-assemblies. Document control and numbering are described in
EDM 22.00 and EDM 23.00.
The NRC staff finds that the identification procedures and methods for the Tricon V10 platform
complies with this Clause 5.11 and are suitable to support fulfillment of this clause by a SR
system. As noted above, identification of the redundant portions of a safety system

– 125 –
(i.e., channels or divisions) is a plant specific activity. Any supplementary identification
approach employed at the system-level will be addressed in a plant-specific review to assure
satisfaction of Clause 5.11.
3.10.2.12 IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.12, “AUXILIARY FEATURES”
Clause 5.12 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that auxiliary supporting features meet all
requirements of this standard, and that auxiliary features that perform a function that is not
required for the safety systems to accomplish their safety functions and are not isolated from the
safety system shall be designed to meet those criteria necessary to ensure that these
components, equipment, and systems do not degrade the safety systems below an acceptable
level. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.12, “Auxiliary Features,” provides acceptance
criteria for Clause 5.12 and cites SRP BTP 7-9, “Guidance on Requirements for Reactor
Protection System Anticipatory Trips,” as providing specific guidance for the review of
anticipatory trips that are auxiliary features of a reactor protection system.
Determination of auxiliary supporting features for a safety system is an application-specific
activity. Since the LTR does not address a specific application, no evaluation of the Tricon V10
platform against this regulatory requirement could be performed.
3.10.2.13 IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.13, “MULTI-UNIT STATIONS”
Clause 5.13 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that the sharing of structures, systems, and
components between units at multi-unit generating stations is permissible provided that the
ability to simultaneously perform required safety functions in all units is not impaired, and that
guidance on the sharing of electrical power systems between units is contained in IEEE
Std 308-1980 “IEEE Standard Criteria for Class IE Power Systems for Nuclear Power
Generating Stations,” and guidance on the application of the single failure criterion to shared
systems is contained in IEEE Std 379-1988, “Application of the Single-Failure Criterion to
Nuclear Power Generating Station Safety Systems.” SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C,
Section 5.13, “Multi Unit Stations,” provides acceptance criteria for Clause 5.13. This
acceptance criterion states that the shared user interfaces must be sufficient to support the
operator needs for each of the shared units. Implementation of a safety system in a multi-unit
station and determination of components can be shared is an application-specific activity. Since
the LTR does not address a specific application, no evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform
against this regulatory requirement could be performed.
3.10.2.14 IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.14, “HUMAN FACTORS CONSIDERATIONS”
Clause 5.14 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that human factors be considered at the initial stages
and throughout the design process to assure that the functions allocated in whole or in part to
the human operators and maintainers can be successfully accomplished to meet the safety
system design goals. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.14, “Human Factors
Considerations,” provides acceptance criteria for Clause 5.14, and states that safety system
human factors design should be consistent with the applicant/licensee's commitments
documented in Chapter 18 of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR).
Implementation of human factors considerations to address functional allocation is an
application-specific activity. Since the LTR does not address a specific application nor include
display devices within its scope, no evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against this regulatory
requirement could be performed.

– 126 –
3.10.2.15 IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 5.15, “RELIABILITY”
Clause 5.15 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that for those systems for which either quantitative or
qualitative reliability goals have been established, appropriate analysis of the design shall be
performed in order to confirm that such goals have been achieved, and that IEEE Std 352-1987
and IEEE Std 577-1976 provide guidance for reliability analysis. SRP Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.15, “Reliability,” provides acceptance criteria for Clause 5.15. This
acceptance criterion states that the applicant/licensee should justify that the degree of
redundancy, diversity, testability, and quality provided in the safety system design is adequate
to achieve functional reliability commensurate with the safety functions to be performed and that
for computer systems, both hardware and software reliability should be analyzed. The
acceptance criteria further states that software that complies with the quality criteria of IEEE
Std 603-1991 Clause 5.3 and that is used in safety systems that provide measures for defense
against common cause failures, as previously described for IEEE Std 603-1991 Clause 5.1, are
considered by the NRC staff to comply with the fundamental reliability requirements of GDC 21,
IEEE Std 279-1971, and IEEE Std 603-1991.
SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.15 further states that the assessment of reliability
should consider the effect of possible hardware and software failures and the design features
provided to prevent or limit the effects of these failures, and that hardware failure conditions to
be considered should include failures of portions of the computer itself and failures of portions of
communication systems. Hard failures, transient failures, sustained failures, and partial failures
should be considered. Software failure conditions to be considered should include, as
appropriate, software common cause failures, cascading failures, and undetected failures. SRP
Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.15 also references SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, and
states quantitative reliability goals are not sufficient as a sole means of meeting the
Commission's regulations for the reliability of digital computers used in safety systems. The
regulation at 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A, GDC 21, “Protection system reliability and
testability,” requires in part that the protection system be designed for high functional reliability
commensurate with the safety functions to be performed.
Determination of the reliability of a safety system is an application-specific activity that requires
an assessment of a full system design. Since the LTR does not address a specific application,
establish a definitive safety system design, nor identify any plant I&C architectures, the
evaluation against this requirement is limited to consideration of the reliability characteristics of
the Tricon V10 platform and its components.
An FMEA was performed in accordance with IEEE Std 352-1987 based on a generic reference
system architecture. The NRC staff’s evaluation of the FMEA determined that it provides an
effective assessment of the potential failure modes and the effect of those failures at the
platform level. Based on the use of redundancy, diagnostics and self-tests, no undetectable
single failures of the Tricon V10 platform were identified in the FMEA. However, an extension of
the analysis to address the effects of software CCF is necessary for an application-specific
FMEA to support a conclusion about defense against CCFs in a digital safety system based on
the Tricon V10 platform.
IOM performed a reliability and availability analysis of the Tricon V10 platform as specified in
Section 4.2.3 of EPRI TR-107330 and documented the results in IOM Document
No. 9600164-532, “Reliability / Availability Study for the Tricon V10” (Reference 47).
Calculations were done for periodic test intervals ranging from 6 to 30 months. In all cases, the
calculated reliability and availability were greater than 99.9 percent, which exceeds the

– 127 –
recommended goal of 99.0 percent from the EPRI TR. For a periodic test interval of 18 months
(corresponding to the typical nuclear power plant refueling outage cycle), the reliability is
99.9987 percent and the availability is 99.9990 percent.
The NRC staff reviewed this study, and agrees that the results of the reliability and availability
analysis of the Tricon V10 platform satisfy the criteria of Clause 5.15.
Based on the evaluation, the NRC staff finds that the results of the IOM reliability and availability
analysis provide supporting evidence to indicate that the Tricon V10 platform is suitable for use
in SR applications in a nuclear power plant. However, an application-specific reliability and
availability analysis must be developed to demonstrate full compliance with this Clause.
3.10.3

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 6, “SENSE AND COMMAND FEATURES –
FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS”

The requirements of this clause, in addition to the requirements of Clause 5, apply to the Sense
and Command Features of a safety system. The sub-clauses of this requirement are given by
the following:
Clause 6.1
Clause 6.2
Clause 6.3
Clause 6.4
Clause 6.5
Clause 6.6
Clause 6.7
Clause 6.8

Automatic Control
Manual Control
Interaction between Sense and Command Features and other Systems
Deviation of System Inputs
Capability for Testing and Calibration
Operating Bypass
Maintenance Bypass
Setpoints

SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 6, “Sense and Command Features – Functional and
Design Requirements,” provides acceptance criteria for Clause 6.
The functional and design requirements for the sense and command features of a safety system
are dependent solely on the specific application. Since the LTR does not address a specific
application of the platform, include the sensors, nor provide a specific safety system design, the
functional and design requirements for a safety system are not available for review and no
evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against these regulatory requirements could be
performed.
Although the requirement for setpoints primarily addresses factors beyond the scope of the
digital platform (i.e., plant design basis limits, modes of operation, and sensor accuracy), the
contribution of the Tricon V10 platform to setpoint uncertainty must be addressed in an
application-specific analysis. The “Tricon V10 EQ Summary Report,” IOM Document
No. 9600164-545 (Reference 24), describes the Tricon V10 system accuracy, which is
documented in the “Tricon System Accuracy Specifications,” IOM Document No. 9600164-534
(Reference 58). As part of the Tricon V10 platform qualification effort, system accuracy
specifications for the Tricon V10 system were established. The accuracy specifications are
documented in accordance with Section 4.2.4 of EPRI TR-107330 and provide information
required by EPRI TR-107330 to support an application specific setpoint analysis per the
International Society of Automation Recommended Practice 67.04, “Setpoints for Nuclear
Safety-Related Instrumentation,” standard. Section 4.2.4 of the EPRI TR identifies the specific
information to be provided. The System Accuracy report provides a single concise listing of the

– 128 –
accuracy specifications of the IOM Tricon V10 platform. The specifications documented are
those typically used by nuclear industry users for calculating instrument measurement
uncertainties and establishing critical control setpoints.
As stated in the System Accuracy Specifications, the Tricon will maintain its rated reference
accuracy specifications over extended periods. As stated in the Failure Modes and Effects
Analysis, failure of components affecting the rated reference accuracy are detected, and the
system will generate an alarm and the faulted module will be indicated. Response to the alarm
would require replacement of the faulted module and restoration of normal operation. No field
adjustments or calibrations of the Tricon are required or possible. The key in the Tricon design
is its TMR architecture. By performing continuous cross comparisons between the triplicated
values, a true and full verification of actual input and output values is maintained. The effects of
calibrated accuracy including drift over time, hysteresis and non-linearity, and repeatability are
applicable to the Tricon system and I/O modules, and their error contributions are specified in
the System Accuracy Specifications document. The effects of temperature sensitivity, power
supply variations, arithmetic operations errors, vibration, radiation and relative humidity are not
applicable to the Tricon system and I/O modules and their error contribution is zero.
The specifications cover all Tricon V10 components and modules that were subjected to
performance and qualification testing. The information provided satisfies the requirements
stated in Section 4.2.4 of TR-107330 and therefore satisfies Clause 6.8 at the platform level.
The configuration of the safety system will be unique for each user depending on the plant
specific application of the Tricon V10 platform. The applicability of specified terms and
approach to determining overall “system” uncertainty with respect to the data contained within
this report is the responsibility of the end user and will be reviewed on an application specific
basis. Applicability of uncertainty terms and the methodology for determination of uncertainty
should be in accordance with the plant specific setpoint and uncertainty programs or other
administrative guidelines.
3.10.4

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 7, “EXECUTE FEATURES – FUNCTIONAL AND
DESIGN REQUIREMENTS”

The requirements of this clause, in addition to the requirements of Clause 5, apply to the
Execute Features of a safety system. The sub-clauses of this requirement are given by the
following:
Clause 7.1
Clause 7.2
Clause 7.3
Clause 7.4
Clause 7.5

Automatic Control
Manual Control
Completion of Protective Action
Operating Bypass
Maintenance Bypass

SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 7, “Execute Features - Functional and Design
Requirements,” provides acceptance criteria for Clause 7.
The functional and design requirements for the execute features of a safety system are
dependent solely on the specific application. Since the LTR does not address a specific
application of the platform, include the actuators or other execute features, nor provide a
specific safety system design, the functional and design requirements for a safety system are
not available for review and no evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against these regulatory
requirements could be performed.

– 129 –
Although the requirement for automatic control addresses the execute features are outside the
scope of the digital platform, the acceptance criteria guidance in SRP Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-C, Section 7.1, “Automatic Control,” states that the evaluation should also confirm
that real-time performance of a digital safety system is deterministic and known. The evaluation
of deterministic performance characteristics of the Tricon V10 platform is contained in
Section 3.4.2 of this SE and is acceptable for demonstrating that the Tricon V10 platform
complies with this requirement.
3.10.5

IEEE STD 603-1991 CLAUSE 8, “POWER SOURCE REQUIREMENTS”

Clause 8 of IEEE Std 603-1991 states that those portions of the Class 1E power system that are
required to provide the power to the many facets of the safety system are governed by the
criteria of this document and are a portion of the safety systems, and that specific criteria unique
to the Class 1E power systems can be found in IEEE Std 308-1980. This clause also states
that for power systems with a degree of redundancy, the safety functions and acceptable
reliability must be retained while power sources are in maintenance bypass. SRP Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-C, Section 8, does not provide acceptance criteria for IEEE Std 603-1991
Clause 8.
Determination of the power sources to be provided to a safety system is an application specific
activity. Since the LTR does not address a specific application of the platform, the evaluation
against this regulatory requirement is limited to the capabilities and characteristics of the Tricon
V10 platform that are relevant for adherence to Clause 8 and its sub-clauses.
Clauses 8.1 and 8.2 address requirements for electrical power sources and nonelectrical power
sources, respectively to the safety system. The Tricon V10 platform only uses electrical power
and the platform scope does not include the AC power source(s), which is application-specific.
Thus, no evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against these regulatory requirements could be
performed.
Clause 8.3 addresses the capability of the safety system to accommodate maintenance bypass
of redundant power sources. The Tricon V10 platform employs power supply modules that are
rated for 175 watts, which is sufficient to supply the power requirements of a fully populated
chassis. Two different power supply modules can be used in a single chassis. Three qualified
models are available to support different power sources: 120 VAC or VDC, 230 VAC, and 24
VDC. The power supply modules possess built in diagnostic circuitry to check for out-of-range
voltages and/or over temperature conditions. Indicator light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the front
face of each power module provide module status.
As shown in Figure 2-3, the Tricon V10 backplane is designed with dual independent power
rails. Both power rails feed each of the three legs on each I/O module and each main processor
module residing within the chassis. Power to each of the three legs is independently provided
through dual voltage regulators on each module. Each power rail is fed from one of the two
power supply modules residing in the chassis. Under normal circumstances, each of the three
legs on each I/O module and each main processor module draw power from both power
supplies through the dual power rails and the dual power regulators. Should one of the power
supplies or its supporting power line fails (or is removed for maintenance), the other power
supply will increase its power output to support the requirements of all modules in the chassis.
Thus, the platform provides suitable capability to enable the safety system to function while one
redundant AC power source is failed or in bypass. While this evaluation indicates the suitability

– 130 –
of the platform to satisfy this requirement, a plant-specific evaluation is necessary to establish
full conformance with Clause 8.
Therefore, the NRC staff has determined that the Tricon V10 platform satisfies the requirements
of 10 CFR 50.55a(h) with regard to IEEE Std 603-1991.
3.11 CONFORMANCE WITH IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003
RG 1.152, Revision 2, “IEEE Standard Criteria for Use of Computers in Safety Systems of
Nuclear Power Plants,” states that conformance with the requirements of IEEE
Std 7-4.3.2-2003, “IEEE Standard Criteria for Digital Computers in Safety Systems of Nuclear
Power Generating Stations,” is a method that the NRC staff has deemed acceptable for
satisfying the Commission’s regulations with respect to high functional reliability and design
requirements for computers used in safety systems of nuclear power plants. SRP Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-D, “Guidance for Evaluation of the Application of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2,” contains
guidance for the evaluation of the application of the requirements of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003.
This section documents the evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against this guidance.
The Regulatory Position in RG 1.152 provides guidance that establishment of a secure
environment be addressed in the development process. SRP acceptance criteria for this
guidance can be found in SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 9 and DI&C-ISG-01. The
evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against this guidance is contained in Section 3.8 of this
SE.
The requirements of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 supplement the requirements of IEEE Std 603-1991
by specifying criteria that address hardware, software, firmware, and interfaces of computer
based safety systems. Consequently, the structure of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 parallels that of
IEEE Std 603-1991. For those clauses where IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 contains no requirements
beyond those found in IEEE Std 603-1991 and SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D contains no
additional guidance, no review for compliance with IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 is required. Thus, the
subsections below are limited to those clauses where further evaluation is warranted. The
review against the driving clauses of IEEE Std 603-1991 is documented in the corresponding
subsections of Section 3.10 in this SE.
3.11.1

IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5, “SAFETY SYSTEM CRITERIA”

Clause 5 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 contains requirements beyond those in IEEE Std 603-1991
Clause 5. In addition, SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5 contains specific acceptance
criteria for IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 Clause 5.
The implementation of a computer-based safety system is an application-specific activity. Since
the LTR does not address a specific application, the evaluation against the following
requirements addresses the capabilities and characteristics of the Tricon V10 platform that are
relevant for adherence to each requirement.
3.11.1.1 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.3, “QUALITY”
Clause 5.3 states that computer development activities must include the development of
computer hardware and software. In addition, Clause 5.3, also states that the integration of
computer hardware and software and the integration of the computer with the safety system
must be addressed in the development process. SRP, Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, Section 5.3,

– 131 –
states that SRP, BTP 7-14 contains SRP acceptance criteria for software development
processes.
The computer development activities of the Tricon platform were reviewed and approved as part
of the Tricon V9 LTR (Reference 34); these activities included the development of the computer
hardware and platform software. Changes to the Tricon platform computer development
process were evaluated in Section 3.2 of this SE, and determined to be acceptable. The NRC
staff found that the integration of computer hardware and software is a planned activity in the
Tricon V10 platform software development process.
The subsections below contain the evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against the specific
criteria of the sub-clauses of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003, Clause 5.3.
3.11.1.1.1 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.3.1, “SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT”
Clause 5.3.1 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 requires an approved QA plan consistent with the
requirements of IEEE/EIA 12207.0-1996 for all software that is resident at runtime. EPRI
TR-106439, as accepted by the NRC SE dated July 17, 1997, and EPRI TR-107330, as
accepted by the NRC SE dated July 30, 1998 provide guidance for the evaluation of existing
commercial computers and software.
The Tricon platform SQAP was evaluated and approved as part of the review of the Tricon V9
LTR (Reference 34), and changes to this SQAP were determined to be acceptable (see
Section 3.2 of this SE). Based on these evaluations, the NRC staff has determined that the
Tricon V10 platform conforms to Clause 5.3.1.
3.11.1.1.1.1

IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.3.1.1, “SOFTWARE QUALITY METRICS”

Clause 5.3.1.1 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 states that the use of software quality metrics
requirements are being met. SRP Appendix 7.1 -D, Section 5.3.1.1, states that metrics are
considered in the review of the software development process in accordance with SRP,
BTP 7-14.
Since the platform pre-developed software was dedicated rather than developed under the
current IOM software QA program, this requirement does not apply within the context of the
scope of the LTR. An evaluation of metric usage for application software development will be
conducted as part of a plant-specific review for any system based on the Tricon V10 platform.
3.11.1.1.2 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.3.2, “SOFTWARE TOOLS”
Clause 5.3.2 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 states that software tools used to support software
development processes and V&V processes shall be controlled under configuration
management, and that the tools shall either be developed to a similar standard as the safety
related software, or that the software tool shall be used in a manner such that defects not
detected by the software tool will be detected by V&V activities. SRP, Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-D, provides guidance for the evaluation of software tool use.
IOM does not credit any software tools in the development of the Tricon V10 platform other than
the TriStation 1131 as described in Sections 3.1.3.2 and 3.1.3.4 of this SE. The TriStation 1131
software has undergone changes as described in the Tricon V10 LTR, and the NRC staff has
evaluated and approved the new version (see Section 3.1.3.2). The TriStation 1131 software is

– 132 –
maintained under the IOM Configuration Management Program described in EDM 20.00
(Reference 49). Software developed with this tool is manually verified (i.e., independently
verified and validated) by IOM to ensure that any defects not detected by the tool will be
detected. The software validation program for the TriStation 1131 was reviewed and approved
in the Tricon V9 LTR (Reference 34), which has not changed since then.
Based on the above, the NRC staff determined that the use of the TriStation 1131 tool for
software development is consistent with the requirements in this clause and is therefore
acceptable.
3.11.1.1.3 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.3.3, “VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION”
Clause 5.3.3 states that a V&V program must address hardware, software, integration of digital
components, and interaction with the nuclear power plant. The V&V program must exist
throughout the entire system life cycle. SRP Appendix 7.1-C states that the software V&V effort
should be performed in accordance with IEEE Std 1012-1998, which is endorsed by RG 1.168,
Revision 1.
The NRC staff used RG 1.168 and IEEE Std 1012 to evaluate the V&V process used for the
Tricon V9 SER (Reference 9). During this review, the NRC staff concluded that although IOM
did not strictly follow IEEE Std 1012 guidelines, the combination of the internal IOM review, the
TÜV certification, and the review by external consultants, provided confidence that the
verification and validation activities related to the Tricon V9 platform software were adequate.
The NRC staff further concluded that the Tricon V9 platform verification and validation activities
are acceptable for software that is intended for SR use in nuclear power plants. However,
acceptance of the Tricon V9 platform was based to a large degree on the TÜV-Rheinland
independent review, and the SER noted that any future version of the Tricon system will require
an equivalent level of independent V&V in order to be considered acceptable for SR use in
nuclear power plants.
As stated in Section 3.2.1 of this SE, the hardware and software changes developed to support
the Tricon V10 were dedicated for SR service. The V&V process used for the Tricon V10
platform, as documented in IOM documents EDM 90.00, “Product Verification” (Reference 50),
and EDM 90.10, “Product Validation” (Reference 51), is essentially the same as was used for
the Tricon V9 software with exception of the changes noted and approved in Section 3.2.1 of
this SE. The IOM V&V evaluations document that the Tricon V10 platform underwent a
combination of the internal IOM review, the TÜV certification, and the review by external
consultants. Furthermore, the NRC staff audited (Reference 6) the V&V process and results
that were implemented for the Tricon V10 platform. The combination of these activities provide
confidence that the verification and validation activities related to the Tricon V10 software were
adequate and the Tricon V10 platform verification and validation activities are acceptable for
software that is intended for SR use in nuclear power plants. However, acceptance of the
Tricon V10 PLC system is based to a large degree on the TÜV-Rheinland independent review,
and any future version of the Tricon system will require an equivalent level of independent V&V
in order to be considered acceptable for SR use in nuclear power plants. Based on these
evaluations the NRC staff has determined that the Tricon V10 platform V&V program conforms
to Clause 5.3.3.

– 133 –
3.11.1.1.4 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.3.4, “INDEPENDENT V&V REQUIREMENTS”
Clause 5.3.4 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 defines the levels of independence required for the V&V
effort, in terms of technical independence, managerial independence, and financial
independence. SRP, Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.3.4, provides detailed guidance to
assist the reviewer in determining the extent of independence of the V&V activities from the
design activities in terms of technical, managerial, and financial aspects.
The independence provided by the V&V activities and QA organization for the Tricon V10
software QA program is discussed in Section 3.2 of this SE. As discussed above, the V&V
process used for the V10 platform (References 50 and 51) does not comply with IEEE Std 1012
guidelines and is essentially the same as was used for the V9 software with exception of the
changes noted and approved in Section 3.2.1 of this SE. However, the IOM V&V evaluations
document that the Tricon V10 platform underwent a combination of the internal IOM review, and
a review by three independent external organizations; TÜV, MPR and Associates, and JLM
Digitech Digital Licensing Services. The results of these independent reviews are documented
in References 52, 32, and 25, respectively. The combination of these activities provide
confidence that the verification and validation activities related to the Tricon V10 platform
software were performed with sufficient independence to satisfy the concepts of IEEE Std 1012.
However, acceptance of the Tricon V10 platform V&V independence is based on the
TÜV-Rheinland independent review, and any future version of the Tricon PLC system will
require an equivalent level of independent V&V in order to be considered acceptable for SR use
in nuclear power plants. Based on these evaluations the NRC staff has determined that the
Tricon V10 platform V&V program conforms to Clause 5.3.4.
3.11.1.1.5 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.3.5, “SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION
MANAGEMENT”
Clause 5.3.5 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 states that software configuration management (SCM)
shall be performed in accordance with IEEE Std 1042-1987, and that IEEE Std 828-1998
provides guidance for the development of software configuration management plans. IEEE
Std 828-1990 and IEEE Std 1042-1987 are endorsed by RG 1.169. SRP, Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-D, states that BTP 7-14 and RG 1.169 provide SRP acceptance criteria for
SCMPs and activities.
The SCM program as described in EDM 20.00, “Configuration Management,” EDM 24.00 ,
“Software Configuration and Change Control”, EDM 40.50 “Software Development Guidelines,”
and IOM Document No. 7286-545-1 (Reference 4) was used for Tricon V10 software
components (see Section 3.2.1 of this SE). The IOM CMP has undergone some changes from
the approved Tricon V9 program. These changes were reviewed and approved in
Section 3.2.1. The NRC staff found that the current configuration management program and
practices of IOM comply with the guidance identified in IEEE Std 828 and IEEE Std 1042, which
are endorsed by RG 1.169. Furthermore, the NRC staff concludes that the QAM, QPM, and
EDM meet the configuration management provisions outlined in BTP-14 and are, therefore,
acceptable for satisfying the regulatory criterion of Clause 5.3.5.
3.11.1.1.6 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003, CLAUSE 5.3.6, SOFTWARE PROJECT RISK
MANAGEMENT
Clause 5.3.6 defines the risk management required for a software project. SRP Chapter 7,
Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.3.6, "Software Project Risk Management" provides acceptance

– 134 –
criteria for software project risk management. This section states that software project risk
management is a tool for problem prevention, and be performed at all levels of the digital
system project to provide adequate coverage for each potential problem area. It also states that
software project risks may include technical, schedule, or resource related risks that could
compromise software quality goals, and thereby affect the ability of the safety computer system
to perform SR functions.
The Tricon V10 upgrade project used a standardized project management process to assess
project risks. This methodology is documented in EDM 20.10, “Project Planning, Revision 7.1,”
as documented in the LTR (Reference 4) and is used to identify, assess, monitor, and control
areas of risk that arise during the software development project. The project risks are identified
in the Engineering Project Plan (EPP) regarding any risks with which or assumptions without
which, the project would be in jeopardy of not meeting its stated objectives. Measures taken to
mitigate risks are described in the EPP. During execution of the project, project risks are
monitored, and measures are taken to mitigate or eliminate the risk to the project in accordance
with the EPP. The NRC staff has reviewed the IOM Project Planning process and determined
that the Tricon V10 platform conforms to Clause 5.3.6.
3.11.1.2

IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.4, “EQUIPMENT QUALIFICATION”

Clause 5.4 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 defines the computer equipment qualification required for a
software project. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.4, “Equipment Qualification,”
provides acceptance criteria for computer equipment qualification. This section of
Appendix 7.1-D states that in addition to the equipment qualification criteria provided by IEEE
Std 603-1991 and Section 5.4 of SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C, additional criteria, as defined
in Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2, are necessary to qualify digital computers for use in safety systems.
These sections are discussed below.
3.11.1.2.1 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.4.1, “COMPUTER SYSTEM TESTING”
Clause 5.4.1 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 discusses the software that should be operational on the
computer system while qualification testing is being performed. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D,
Section 5.4.1, “Computer System Testing,” provides acceptance criteria for computer equipment
qualification testing. This section states that computer equipment qualification testing should be
performed while the computer is functioning, with software and diagnostics that are
representative of those used in actual operation. Section 3.3 of this SE discusses the
evaluation of the environmental qualification program for the Tricon V10 platform. IOM
complied with the guidance of EPRI TR-107330 for the generic qualification of a PLC platform.
EPRI TR-107330, Section 6.2.2, “Test Specimen Application Program Configuration
Requirements,” specifies development of a synthetic application program to verify the PLC
functionality under the full range of service conditions (i.e., normal conditions as well as
environmental extremes). In addition, Table 5.1 of EPRI TR-107330 specifies the testing
conditions under which specific tests must be executed. Section 3.3 of this SE discusses the
TSAP developed by IOM for its generic qualification program. The TSAP was specifically
designed to support qualification testing of the Tricon V10 platform while providing functionality
representative of SR applications.
Based on evaluation in Section 3.3 of this SE and review of the design, testing, and qualification
test plans and procedures for the TSAP (IOM Document Nos. 9600164-513, Revision 2, and
9600164-536, Revision 0 (References 39 and 40)), the NRC staff concludes that the IOM

– 135 –
qualification program meets the requirement for computer testing of the Tricon V10 platform and
satisfies the requirements of this Clause.
3.11.1.2.2 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.4.2, “QUALIFICATION OF EXISTING
COMMERCIAL COMPUTERS”
Clause 5.4.2 defines the Qualification of Existing Commercial Computers for use in SR
applications in nuclear power plants. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.4.2,
“Qualification of Existing Commercial Computers,” provides acceptance criteria for equipment
qualifications. This section states that EPRI TR-106439, "Guideline on Evaluation and
Acceptance of Commercial Grade Digital Equipment for Nuclear Safety Applications", and EPRI
TR-107330, "Generic Requirements Specification for Qualifying a Commercially Available PLC
for Safety Related Applications in Nuclear Power Plants," provide specific guidance for the
evaluation of commercial grade digital equipment and existing PLCs.
The qualification of the Tricon V9 equipment was addressed in the Tricon V9 LTR and
associated SE (References 34 and 9). Changes to this approved system that were invoked to
develop the Tricon V10 platform have been evaluated in Sections 3.2.1, 3.3, and 3.7.1 of this
SE and found to comply with the regulations. Therefore, the Tricon V10 platform conforms to
Clause 5.4.2.
3.11.1.3

IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003, CLAUSE 5.5, "SYSTEM INTEGRITY"

Clause 5.5 states that in addition to the system integrity criteria provided by IEEE Std 603-1998,
the digital system shall be designed for computer integrity, test and calibration, and fault
detection and self-diagnostics activities. These attributes are further defined in IEEE
Std 7-4.3.2-2003, Clause 5.5.1, "Design for computer integrity," Clause 5.5.2, "Design for test
and calibration," and Clause 5.5.3, "Fault detection and self-diagnostics"; these sub-clauses are
evaluated in the subsections below. There are no specific acceptance criteria shown in SRP
Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.5, "System Integrity."
3.11.1.3.1 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.5.1, “DESIGN FOR COMPUTER INTEGRITY”
Clause 5.5.1 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 states that the computer must be designed to perform its
safety function when subjected to conditions, either external or internal, that have significant
potential for defeating the safety function.
The Tricon V10 system is triple redundant from input terminal to output terminal (as described in
Section 3.1 of this SE). The TMR architecture is intended to allow continued system operation
in the presence of any single point of failure within the system. The TMR architecture is also
intended to allow the Tricon V10 to detect and correct individual faults on-line, without
interruption of monitoring, control, and protection capabilities. In the presence of a fault, the
Tricon V10 will alarm the condition, remove the affected portion of the faulted module from
operation, and continue to function normally in a dual redundant mode. The system returns to
the fully triple redundant mode of operation when the affected module is replaced.
The Tricon V10 platform has redundant power supplies and backup batteries that supply the
TMR system. The redundant features of the Tricon V10 system are described in Section 3.1.1
of this SE. The TMR design redundancy provides fault tolerant capabilities which, coupled with
diagnostics and self-testing as discussed in Section 3.4.3 of this SE, provides a high-level of
computer integrity. Furthermore, the computer qualification activities documented by IOM,

– 136 –
which are discussed in Sections 3.2, 3.2.1, and 3.3, provide suitable evidence that the Tricon
V10 platform is capable of handling conditions, external or internal, that have the potential to
defeat implemented safety functions. Specifically, the NRC staff review of the platform's
capability to withstand single failures in Section 3.5 of this SE, the demonstration of
environmental withstand (subject to noted generic open items) in Section 3.3, and the provisions
for security (SDOE) in Section 3.6, supports the determination that the Tricon V10 platform
satisfies Clause 5.5.1.
3.11.1.3.2 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.5.2, “DESIGN FOR TEST AND CALIBRATION”
Clause 5.5.2 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 states that test and calibration functions shall not
adversely affect the ability of the computer to perform its safety function, and that it shall be
verified that the test and calibration functions do not affect computer functions that are not
included in a calibration change. The clause further states that V&V, configuration
management, and QA be required for test and calibration functions on separate computers such
as test and calibration computers that provide the sole verification of test and calibration data,
but that V&V, configuration management, and QA is not required when the test and calibration
function is resident on a separate computer and does not provide the sole verification of test
and calibration data for the computer that is part of the safety system.
Determination of the test and calibration requirements for a safety system that must be fulfilled
depends upon the plant-specific safety requirements that apply and establishment of the types
of surveillance necessary for the safety system to ensure that the identifiable single failures only
identified through testing are application-specific activities. Since the LTR does not address a
specific application or establish a definitive safety system design, the evaluation against this
requirement is limited to consideration of the means provided within the platform to enable
testing and calibration of an implemented system. Online diagnostics and self-tests are
provided by the Tricon V10 to support test and calibration requirements in general. The
methods for calibration of Tricon V10 platform in the field are not within the scope of the LTR so
this capability is not reviewed in this SE. The qualification tests performed for the Tricon V10
platform were conducted with diagnostics executing in conjunction with a TSAP application
program simulating safety system functions (see Section 3.3 of this SE). The performance of
these tests demonstrated that the diagnostics and self-tests did not adversely affect the ability of
the computer to perform its simulated safety functions. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that
the diagnostic and self-test capabilities provided by the Tricon V10 platform conform to the
requirements of Clause 5.5.2.
3.11.1.3.3 IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.5.3, “FAULT DETECTION AND
SELF-DIAGNOSTICS”
Clause 5.5.3 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 discusses fault detection and self-diagnostics, and states
that if reliability requirements warrant self-diagnostics, then computer programs should contain
functions to detect and report computer system faults and failures in a timely manner, and that
these self-diagnostic functions shall not adversely affect the ability of the computer system to
perform its safety function, or cause spurious actuations of the safety function.
The software-based Tricon V10 diagnostics and self-test capabilities provide extensive and
thorough coverage of the identified failure modes from the FMEA performed by IOM (see
Sections 3.4.3 and 3.5 of this SE for discussions of diagnostic and test software and the Tricon
V10 FMEA, respectively). The Tricon V10 PLC system provides continuous self-testing,
including monitoring memory and memory reference integrity, using watchdog timers,

– 137 –
monitoring communication channels, monitoring central processing unit status, and checking
data integrity. The Tricon V10 PLC system performs self-tests and I/O validation on each
module. The Tricon V10 PLC system TMR architecture provides continuous self-testing to
detect, tolerate, and alarm on single internal failures. The internal self-test functions are
transparent to the application program and are an integral part of the base platform operating
software. These diagnostics check each main processor, as well as each I/O module and
communication channel. Transient faults are recorded and masked by the hardware majorityvoting circuit. Persistent faults are diagnosed, and the faulted module can be replaced or
operated in a fault-tolerant manner until replacement is completed.
The NRC staff reviewed these self-test capabilities, and finds them acceptable to satisfy
Clause 5.5.3 at the platform level. However, implementation of the Tricon V10 platform into an
application specific safety system may require additional fault-detection and diagnostic
capabilities be implemented as part of the application or system design to provide more
comprehensive coverage of identified failures with automatic tests and diagnostics. Therefore,
a plant-specific evaluation is necessary to establish full conformance with Clause 5.5.3.
3.11.1.4

IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.6, “INDEPENDENCE”

Clause 5.6 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 states that, in addition to the requirements of IEEE
Std 603-1991, data communications between safety channels or between safety and non-safety
systems shall not inhibit the performance of the safety function. In addition, if safety and
non-safety software reside on the same computer and use the same computer resources, then
the non-safety software functions shall be developed in accordance with SR software
development practices. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.6, “Independence,” provides
acceptance criteria for communication between the safety systems and non-safety systems.
This section states that the regulation at 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A, GDC 24, “Separation of
protection and control systems,” requires the protection system be separated from control
systems to the extent that failure of any single control system component or channel, or failure
or removal from service of any single protection system component or channel that is common
to the control and protection systems leaves intact a system satisfying all reliability, redundancy,
and independence requirements of the protection system, and that interconnection of the
protection and control systems shall be limited so as to assure that safety is not significantly
impaired. The ISG 4 was developed to address communication independence.
Establishment of communications among redundant portions of a safety system or between the
safety system and other non-safety systems in a plant is an application specific activity. The
base platform architecture identified in the LTR does not specify any direct connections or
bi-directional communications between the Tricon V10 platform and any other system external
to the Tricon V10 system. Since the LTR does not address a specific application or provide a
definitive safety system design, the evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform against the
communications independence aspect of this regulatory requirement is limited to features and
capabilities of its communication interfaces.
The Tricon V10 platform does not contain any NSR software. The description of the
communications independence and interconnections for the Tricon V10 platform is contained in
Sections 3.7 and 3.7.1 of this SE. Section 3.4.2 of this SE discusses the deterministic
performance characteristics.
The NRC staff evaluated data independence between redundant portions of a safety system or
between non-safety systems in Sections 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.8, 3.7.1, and 3.7.2 of this SE.

– 138 –
Section 3.7.3 provides the NRC staff's evaluation of the Tricon V10 platform data
communication features independence per DI&C ISG-04. Based on these evaluations the NRC
staff has determined that the digital Tricon V10 platform conforms to Clause 5.6. However, the
specific interconnections defined for a plant specific safety application must be determined and
evaluated in a plant-specific review.
3.11.1.5

IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.11, “IDENTIFICATION”

Clause 5.11 of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 states that: (1) identification requirements specific to
software systems (i.e., firmware and software identification) shall be used to assure the correct
software is installed in the correct hardware component, (2) means shall be included in the
software such that the identification may be retrieved from the firmware using software
maintenance tools, and (3) physical identification requirements of the digital computer system
hardware shall be in accordance with the identification requirements in IEEE Std 603-1991
Clause 5.11. SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.11, “Identification” provides
acceptance criteria and adds that the identification should be clear and unambiguous. The
identification should include the revision level, and should be traceable to configuration control
documentation that identifies the changes made by that revision for computer equipment
qualification.
The IOM QA Program Manual defines requirements for the identification and control of items
and provides procedures for establishing and maintaining system configuration management in
EDM 20.00 (Reference 49). Under this Configuration Management Program (CMP), IOM has
established labeling, tracking and record keeping practices and procedures to control the
identification of hardware and software components. All documents, drawings, and source code
identified as deliverables in the Engineering Project Plan (EPP) are maintained under strict
configuration management. The Tricon V10 platform configuration management measures
began early in the Tricon V10 platform development cycle, at the subcomponent/module level,
to assure an orderly and controlled development process. Configuration management was
applied to software, hardware, and design documentation at an appropriate point in the process
when the item was given a unique identity and baseline, and when subsequent configuration
tracking of the item was required by the project plan. CM tools (Agile and CM Synergy) are
used to support configuration management activities (i.e., control check in and check-out of
software modules). Each document, part, or software component is assigned a unique number
per Engineering Document Numbering System standard (IOM procedure EDM 23.00). Each
document shows the revision and issue update history and the current “as designed” revision
that also defines the latest “to be built” hardware configuration. Each product, up to the system
level, is defined by material lists at the appropriate number of indenture levels. These material
lists identify the parts (including software and hardware), assemblies, and supporting
documentation, along with their respective version/revision numbers, required to construct and
sustain the product. Pursuant to their CMP, IOM provides physical labels on the printed circuit
board of each module to uniquely identify the hardware module and installed firmware. As part
of the regulatory audits conducted at the IOM facility (Reference 6), the NRC staff observed
component identification based on the physical labels applied to representative modules.
The IOM software CMP for application software is outside of the scope of this review. Tricon
V10 source code is an identified CMP component so version management and change control
mechanisms are applied. The platform software components for the Tricon V10 platform are
controlled based on assigned part numbers. The configuration information of each software
component is securely maintained as part of the IOM system configuration management
records and can be referenced by part number for a specific project. Software versions for the

– 139 –
assemblage of software components are defined in terms of a formally released, configuration
controlled software project. The IOM CMP used to develop the Tricon V9 platform was
previously approved by the NRC in its Tricon V9 SE. The IOM CMP has undergone some
changes from the approved Tricon V9 program. These changes were reviewed and approved
in Section 3.2.1. The NRC staff found that the current configuration management program and
practices of IOM comply with the guidance identified in IEEE Std 828 and IEEE Std 1042, which
are endorsed by RG 1.169.
The compiled system software for each processor contains embedded information and an
internal checksum. Identification of the system software can be checked using special
equipment at the factory as described in Section 3.8.1 of this SE. Based on this evaluation and
the findings regarding hardware identification in Section 3.10.2.11 of this SE, the NRC staff
determined that the Tricon V10 platform complies with the guidance of IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003
Clause 5.11 for its system software. Evaluation of application software is outside the scope of
this review and will be addressed as part of an application-specific review.
3.11.1.6

IEEE STD 7-4.3.2-2003 CLAUSE 5.15, “RELIABILITY”

Clause 5.15 states that, in addition to the requirements of IEEE Std 603-1991, when reliability
goals are identified, the proof of meeting the goals should include the software. The method for
determining reliability may include combinations of analysis, field experience, or testing.
Software error recording and trending may be used in combination with analysis, field
experience, or testing. Additional guidance is provided in SRP Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1-C,
Section 5.15, and Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.15.
SRP Appendix 7.1-D, Section 5.15, identifies RG 1.152, containing guidance regarding digital
computer reliability. The SRP, Appendix 7.1-C, Appendix 7.1-D, and RG 1.152, states that
quantitative reliability goals are not sufficient as a sole means of meeting the NRC's regulations
for the reliability of digital computers used in safety systems. Quantitative reliability
determination, using a combination of analysis, testing, and operating experience, can provide
an added level of confidence in the reliable performance of the computer system. However,
since there is not a widely accepted view on software reliability value, determining a failure
probability and therefore a reliability value for software is not possible. Therefore, NRC relies on
the use of a high quality process of software design to obtain high quality software.
Determination of the reliability of a digital safety system is an application-specific activity that
requires an assessment of a full system design, its application and system software, and the
software life cycle processes. Since the LTR does not address a specific application, establish
a definitive safety system design, nor identify any plant I&C architectures, the evaluation against
this requirement is limited to consideration of the reliability characteristics of the digital platform
and the quality of its system software.
Evaluation of the hardware reliability for the Tricon V10 platform is addressed in
Section 3.10.2.15 of this SE. IOM performed a quantitative reliability and availability analysis for
the Tricon V10 platform (see Section 3.6 of this SE) as specified by EPRI TR-107330.
No quantitative reliability goals are specified for the Tricon V10 platform software. A qualitative
evaluation of software reliability for a safety system involves consideration of the quality of the
software as demonstrated through its life cycle processes, testing, and operating experience.
Acceptable software reliability of the Tricon V10 platform was achieved by a combination of the
following factors:

– 140 –
•
•
•

High quality development processes that minimize the introduction of errors,
High quality verification and validation processes that maximize the detection any errors
introduced, and
Design and architectural features.

The Tricon V10 platform software has undergone commercial grade dedication pursuant to
EPRI TR-107330 and EPRI TR-106439 as pre-developed software and the associated
development history, operating experience, life cycle documentation, and testing and review
activities have been reviewed and approved by the NRC (see Section 3.2.1 of this SE). The
platform software processes were reviewed in accordance with BTP 7-14 to ensure that they will
produce reliable software (i.e., will produce high quality software). The impact of software
common cause failures was not provided in the LTR and therefore, will have to be reviewed as
an application specific item. The reliability impact of potential security (SDOE) vulnerabilities
was addressed in Section 3.8 of this SE. Based on these evaluations the NRC staff has
determined that the digital Tricon V10 platform conforms to the guidance of Clause 5.15.
However, demonstration of the hardware and software reliability of the implemented system is
necessary to fully comply with this clause for digital safety system reliability. Specifically, an
evaluation of system reliability, including the contribution of application software, will be required
in a plant-specific review.
3.12 SUMMARY OF REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
This SE discusses the acceptability of the Tricon V10 platform for use as the basis for a SR
DI&C system in nuclear power plants. Each of the findings or conclusions summarized below
may be subject to the satisfactory resolution of generic open items identified in the foregoing
sections and documented in Section 4.1 of this SE. Careful attention must also be given to the
plant-specific items listed in Section 4.2 of this SE.
This SE discusses the acceptability of the Tricon V10 PLC system. The GDC listed in
Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50 establish the minimum requirements for the design of nuclear
power plants; 10 CFR 50.55a(h) incorporates IEEE Std 603-1991. The RGs and endorsed
industry codes and standards listed in the SRP, Table 7-1, are the guidelines used as the basis
for this evaluation.
Section 50.55a(a)(1), "Quality Standards for Systems Important to Safety," is addressed by
conformance with the codes and standards listed in the SRP. In the development of the Tricon
V10 PLC system, IOM used codes and standards that are the same as or equivalent to the
standards identified in the SRP. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that the Tricon V10 PLC
system conforms to this requirement.
Section 50.55a(h) incorporates by reference IEEE Std 603-1991, which addresses both
system-level design issues and quality criteria for qualifying devices. The NRC staff has
determined that the Tricon V10 PLC system satisfies the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(h) with
regard to IEEE Std 603-1991 as described in Section 3.10 of this SE.
The NRC staff determined that the following GDCs specified in Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50
are the applicable design criteria for this review:
GDC 1:
GDC 2:
GDC 4:

Quality Standards and Records
Design Basis for Protection against Natural Phenomena
Environmental and Missile Design Bases

– 141 –
GDC 13:
GDC 20:
GDC 21:
GDC 22:
GDC 23:
GDC 24:
GDC 25:
GDC 29:

Instrumentation and Control
Protection System Functions
Protection System Reliability and Test ability
Protection System Independence
Protection System Failure Modes
Separation of Protection and Control Systems
Protection System Requirements for Reactivity Control Malfunctions
Protection against Anticipated Operational Occurrences

The NRC staff reviewed the equipment descriptions in the LTR for conformance to the
guidelines in the regulatory guides and industry codes and standards that apply to this
equipment. The NRC staff concludes that IOM adequately identified the guidelines that apply to
this equipment. Given the review of the equipment designs for conformance to the guidelines,
the staff finds that there is reasonable assurance that the Tricon V10 system conforms to the
applicable guidelines. Therefore, the NRC staff finds that the requirements of GDC 1 and
10 CFR 50.55a(a)(1) have been met.
The review included identifying those components and assemblies of the Tricon V10 that are
designed to survive the effects of earthquakes and abnormal environments. On the basis of this
review, the NRC staff concludes that IOM has identified those components and assemblies
consistent with the design bases for the intended SR applications of the Tricon V10 system and
has demonstrated their environmental qualification is adequate to cope with abnormal
environments (as discussed in Section 3.3 of this SE). Therefore, the NRC staff finds that the
identification and qualification of those components and assemblies satisfies the requirements
of GDC 2 and GDC 4.
On the bases of its review of the Tricon V10 system status information, manual interface
capabilities, and provisions to support safe shutdown, the NRC staff concludes that information
is provided to monitor the Tricon V10 system over the anticipated ranges for normal operation,
for anticipated operational occurrences, and for accident conditions so as to ensure adequate
safety. Appropriate controls can be provided for manual initiation of a reactor trip. The Tricon
V10 platform can appropriately support actions to safely operate a nuclear power unit under
normal conditions and to maintain it in a safe condition under accident conditions. Therefore,
the NRC staff finds that the Tricon V10 system design satisfies the requirements of GDC 13.
Given its review of the LTR, the NRC staff concludes that the Tricon V10 system conforms to
the design-basis requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(f), and to the guidance of IEEE Std 603 and
RG 1.105. The NRC staff also concludes that the Tricon V10 system includes the necessary
provisions to detect accident conditions and anticipated operational occurrences in order to
initiate reactor shutdown consistent with the accident analysis presented in Chapter 15 of a
licensee's SAR. Licensee evaluation of plant-specific accident analyses is required. Therefore,
the NRC staff finds that the Tricon V10 system satisfies the requirements of GDC 20.
The Tricon V10 system conforms to the guidelines for periodic testing in RG 1.22 and RG 1.118.
Bypassed and inoperable status indication can be supported to conform to the guidelines of
RG 1.47. A Tricon V10 system installation can also conform to the guidelines regarding the
application of the single-failure criterion in IEEE Std 379. On the basis of this review, the NRC
staff concludes that the Tricon V10 system satisfies the guidance of IEEE Std 603-1991 and
IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003 with regard to system reliability and testability. Therefore, the NRC staff
finds that the Tricon V10 system satisfies the requirements of GDC 21.

– 142 –
On the basis of its review, the NRC staff concludes that the Tricon V10 system satisfies the
guidance of IEEE Std 603-1991, IEEE Std 7-4.3.2-2003, and the guidance in RG 1.75 with
regard to protection system independence. Therefore, the NRC staff finds that the Tricon V10
system satisfies the requirements of GDC 22.
On the basis of its review of the FMEA for the Tricon V10 PLC system, the NRC staff concludes
that the Tricon V10 platform/system is designed to fail into a safe mode if conditions such as
disconnection of the system, loss of energy, or adverse environment are experienced.
Therefore, the NRC staff finds that the Tricon V10 system satisfies the requirements of GDC 23.
Based on its review of the interfaces between the Tricon V10 system and plant operating control
systems, the NRC staff concludes that the Tricon V10 system satisfies the guidance of IEEE
Std 603 with regard to control and protection system interactions at the platform level.
Therefore, the NRC staff finds that the Tricon V10 system satisfies the requirements of GDC 24.
Plant-specific safety I&C systems implemented on a Tricon V10 platform have the capability to
comply with GDC 25. The specific variables to be monitored and the associated processing
logic must be determined on a plant-specific basis.
On the basis of its review of all GDCs listed above, the NRC staff concludes that the Tricon V10
system satisfies the requirements of GDC 29, “Protection against Anticipated Operational
Occurrences.”
On the basis of its review of software development plans and inspections of the computer
development process and design outputs, the NRC staff concludes that the Tricon V10 PLC
system meets the guidance of RG 1.152. Therefore, the special characteristics of computer
systems have been adequately addressed, and the NRC staff finds that the Tricon V10 system
satisfies the requirements of GDC 1 and 21.
The NRC staff determined that the Tricon V10 PLC system meets the relevant requirements of
GDCs 1, 2, 4, 13, 20-25, and 29.
4.0

LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS

On the basis of the review documented in this SE report, the NRC staff concludes that the
Tricon V10 platform is acceptable for use in the development, installation, and operation of SR
systems in nuclear power plants, pending acceptable resolution of the generic open items
identified in Section 4.1 and subject to the plant-specific conditions and limitations listed in
Section 4.2.
4.1

GENERIC OPEN ITEMS

Chassis alarm relays were not seismically qualified as part of Seismic Testing as noted in
Section 3.3.5.
4.2

PLANT-SPECIFIC ACTION ITEMS

The following plant-specific actions must be performed by an applicant when requesting NRC
approval for installation of a SR system based on the Tricon V10 platform.

– 143 –
1. As noted in Section 2.1, IOM also submitted the Nuclear Safety Integration Program
Manual (NSIPM). The NSIPM governs application specific development activities that
occur at IOM’s facility. The NRC staff reviewed this document, but made no safety
determinations and it is not approved by this SE. It is an ASAI for the NRC staff to
perform a review of any application specific development activities governed by the
NSIPM when requesting NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on the
Tricon V10 platform.
2. Section 3.2 of this SE discusses the software development processes for the Tricon V10
platform. Although the NRC staff has approved the IOM software development and
lifecycle planning program (Plans), the NRC staff determined that some of these Plans
are also the responsibility of the licensee, and must be developed before the Tricon V10
platform software can be used for SR applications in nuclear power plants. Therefore,
the following Plans must be developed and submitted with any license specific
application referencing the Tricon V10 platform:
•
•
•
•

Software Installation Plan
Software Maintenance Plan
Software Operations Plan
Software Safety Plan

The NRC staff will evaluate these plans in accordance with BTP 7-14 when an applicant
requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on the Tricon V10
platform.
3. Section 2.2 of this SE discusses the regulatory criteria used as the basis for this review.
Determination of full compliance with the applicable regulations remains subject to plant
specific licensing review of a full system design based on the Tricon V10 platform.
Licensees must make a determination of full compliance with the design criteria and
regulations identified in SRP Chapter 7, Table 7-1, which are relevant to specific
applications of DI&C systems. This determination will be reviewed by the NRC staff
when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on
the Tricon V10 platform.
4. Section 3.1.3.2 of this SE discusses the use of the TriStation 1131. That section noted
that the Tricon V10 platform is designed such that the Tricon V10 platform would not
normally be connected to a TriStation PC during SR operation. The plant-specific
procedures which disconnect or control the connection of the TriStation PC such that the
TriStation tool cannot affect the safety related functions of the Tricon PLC system during
operation will be reviewed by the NRC staff when an applicant requests NRC approval
for the installation of a SR system based on the Tricon V10 platform. In addition, the
testing of the operational software produced by the TriStation 1131, and these test
plans, procedures, and results will be reviewed by the NRC staff when an applicant
requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on the Tricon V10
platform.
5. Section 3.2 of this SE discusses verification and validation. Although IOM did not strictly
follow guidelines of IEEE Std 1012, the NRC staff determined that the combination of the
internal IOM review, the TÜV certification, and the review by independent consultants
provided acceptable verification and validation for software that is intended for SR use in
nuclear power plants. However, the NRC staff noted that a significant portion of its

– 144 –
acceptance is predicated upon the independent review by TÜV-Rheinland, and
licensees using any Tricon PLC system beyond Tricon V10.5.1 must ensure that similar
or equivalent independent V&V is performed; without this, the Tricon PLC system will not
be considered acceptable for SR use at nuclear power plants. Should licensees use
future Tricon PLC systems beyond Tricon V10.5.1 which have not received TÜVRheinland certification, the NRC staff will review the acceptability of the independent
V&V during the plant-specific safety evaluation.
6. Sections 3.3 and 3.10.2.4 of this SE discuss environmental qualification. EPRI
TR-107330, “Generic Requirements Specification for Qualifying a Commercially
Available PLC for Safety-Related Applications in Nuclear Power Plants,” which was
accepted by NRC SE dated July 30, 1998, presents a set of requirements to be applied
to the generic qualification of PLCs for application to SR I&C systems in nuclear power
plants. It is intended to provide a qualification envelope for a plant-specific application.
As noted in section 3.3 of this SE, several EQ tests did not fully meet the acceptance
criteria of TR-107330 (e.g., EMC and Seismic Withstand). The licensee must make a
determination that the as-tested envelope bounds the requirements of the specific
application. Also, licensees must verify that the maximum test voltages cited in
Section 3.3 envelop the maximum credible voltages applied to Non-Class 1E interfaces
at their facility. Furthermore, licensees must provide further testing or mitigations for
equipment that does not meet plant specific requirements such as the multi-mode fiber
optic cable noted in Section 3.3.1. This determination will be reviewed by the NRC staff
when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on
the Tricon V10 platform.
7. Sections 3.4.1 and 3.10.2.5 of this SE discuss response time. On the basis of the
measured response times for the baseline testing, the Tricon V10 platform is not in
compliance with Section 4.2.1, Item A, of EPRI TR-107330. However, the NRC staff
determined that the response time characteristics are suitable to support SR applications
in nuclear power plants. The licensee must make a determination regarding the
response time performance of a SR system based on the Tricon V10 platform to ensure
that it satisfies its plant- and application-specific requirements for system response time
presented in the accident analysis in Chapter 15 of the safety analysis report for the
plant. This determination will be reviewed by the NRC staff when an applicant requests
NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on the Tricon V10 platform.
8. Section 3.4.3 of this SE discusses diagnostics and self-test capabilities. The NRC staff
reviewed these self-test capabilities, and finds them to be suitable for a digital system
used in SR applications in nuclear power plants. It may also be possible to use some of
these diagnostic capabilities to modify or eliminate certain TS-required periodic
surveillance tests; however this is a plant specific, application-dependent issue and,
therefore, is not addressed in this SE. The licensee must provide any such surveillance
test modifications or eliminations as part of plant-specific licensing amendment requests.
This determination will be reviewed by the NRC staff when an applicant requests NRC
approval for the installation of a SR system based on the Tricon V10 platform.
9. Section 3.7.2.1 of this SE discusses communications interconnections. All external
communications connections will require justification of the deterministic quality of TCM
routed data in the application specific review. The licensee must provide a justification
that should include the minimum guaranteed throughput on the COMBUS based on
application specific scan time and number of I/O and the selected protocol. The

– 145 –
justification should also include an assessment of TCM vulnerabilities based on the
application specific design (reference CDR Report (Reference 32) and ISG 2&4
NTX-SER-09-10 (Reference 29)). This justification will be reviewed by the NRC staff
when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on
the Tricon V10 platform.
10. Section 3.7.2.2 of this SE discusses non-safety I/O connected to a remote RXM chassis.
The NRC staff concluded that adequate protection is provided to the safety side I/O bus
and the overall safety function. All data received from a non-safety remote RXM must
be treated as non-safety data. The licensee must make a determination that adequate
isolation is maintained in the design and that no data received from the non-safety I/O is
used to make a safety determination. This determination will be reviewed by the NRC
staff when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based
on the Tricon V10 platform.
11. Section 3.7.3.1 of this SE discusses the 20 individual points of DI&C-ISG-04, Section 1,
Interdivisional Communications. The LTR does not provide a specific safety system
design. The licensee must make a determination regarding interdivisional
communication including justifications as noted in the individual subsections of
Section 3.7.3.1 of this SE report. This determination will be reviewed by the NRC staff
when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on
the Tricon V10 platform.
12. Section 3.7.3.2 of this SE discusses DI&C-ISG-04, Section 2 - Command Prioritization.
The design of field device interfaces and the determination of means for command
prioritization are application-specific activities. Since the LTR does not address a
specific application, no evaluation against this NRC staff position could be performed.
The licensee must provide the design of field device interfaces and the determination of
means for command prioritization. This determination will be reviewed by the NRC staff
when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on
the Tricon V10 platform.
13. Section 3.7.3.3 of this SE discusses DI&C-ISG-04, Section 3, Multidivisional Control and
Display Stations. The design of information displays and operator workstations and the
determination of information sources and interconnections are application-specific
activities. Since the LTR does not address a specific application nor include display
devices within the scope of the platform, the licensee must provide the design of
information displays and operator workstations and the determination of information
sources and interconnections. This determination will be reviewed by the NRC staff
when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on
the Tricon V10 platform.
14. Section 3.8.1 of this SE discusses the secure development environment. The NRC staff
observed elements of the secure development environment during the December 2010
audit at IOM’s Irvine, California facility. The NRC staff also reviewed Sections 4.2 and
5.1 of the Tricon V9 SE and find that the previous conclusions still apply. Based on a
review of “Tricon V10 Conformance to R.G. 1.152,” IOM document NTX-SER-10-14
(Reference 35), Section 3.1, regarding secure development environment and a
comparison to the previously reviewed development environment from the Tricon V9 SE
combined with direct observations of the current development environment at IOM’s
facility in Irvine, California, the NRC staff determined that IOM meets the requirements

– 146 –
for secure development environment in RG 1.152, Revision 3. The licensee must make
a determination that the secure development environment has not changed and confirm
that the application secure development environment is the equivalent or otherwise
meets the requirements of RG 1.152, Revision 3. This determination will be reviewed by
the NRC staff when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR
system based on the Tricon V10 platform.
15. Section 3.8.1 of this SE discusses the secure operational environment. Without a
specific operational environment to assess, the NRC staff could not reach a final
conclusion on the Tricon V10 platform’s ability to withstand undesirable behavior of
connected systems and preclude inadvertent access. However, the Tricon V10 platform
does have features that could be credited by a licensee when demonstrating these
protections. Licensees must provide a description of the secure design and operational
environment for the application software and hardware at their facility, which will be
reviewed by the NRC staff when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation
of a SR system based on the Tricon V10 platform.
16. Section 3.9 of this SE discusses diversity and defense-in-depth (D3). Since both
diversity and defense-in-depth are plant specific topics, the LTR did not address these
topics, and therefore are not within the scope of this SE. Sections 3.6.2 and 3.6.3 of
Appendix B, "Application Guide," to IOM Document No. 7286-545-1, provide guidance in
the preparation of a plant specific D3 evaluation. A review of the differences between
the Tricon V10 system and the non-safety control system implemented at a particular
nuclear power plant, and the determination that plant specific required diversity and
defense-in-depth continue to be maintained must be addressed in a plant-specific D3
evaluation. These determinations will be reviewed by the NRC staff when an applicant
requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on the Tricon V10
platform.
17. Section 3.10.3 of this SE discusses conformance with IEEE Std 603-1991, including
setpoint determination. IOM has performed an analysis of accuracy, repeatability,
thermal effects and other necessary data for use in a plant-specific setpoint analysis.
Licensees must ensure that, when the Tricon V10 is installed, setpoint calculations are
reviewed and, if required, setpoints are modified to ensure that the Tricon V10 platform
will perform within system specifications. This determination will be reviewed by the
NRC staff when an applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system
based on the Tricon V10 platform.
18. Section 3.7.1 of this SE discusses communications with SR equipment. The
documentation confirms testing of the TriStation 1131 library with the SAP protocol.
However, the protocol will also be implemented at the application layer of the connected
SR equipment, presumably an SVDU. The documentation does not confirm that the
protocol has been tested with any specific external SR devices. Therefore, it is an ASAI
for the applicant to verify that the SAP library is tested in any proposed application
specific SR devices. This determination will be reviewed by the NRC staff when an
applicant requests NRC approval for the installation of a SR system based on the Tricon
V10 platform.
19. Section 3.7.3.1.10 of this SE discusses protection of safety division software. In order
for the NRC staff to accept this keyswitch function as compliant with this Staff Position,
the NRC staff will have to evaluate an application specific system communications

– 147 –
control configuration including the operation of the keyswitch, the software affected by
the keyswitch, and any testing performed on failures of the hardware and software
associated with the keyswitch when an applicant requests NRC approval for the
installation of a SR system based on the Tricon V10 platform.
5.0

CONCLUSION

Based on the findings of Section 3.0 that are summarized above, the NRC staff concludes that,
when properly installed and used, the Tricon V10 platform is acceptable for SR use in nuclear
power plants, subject to satisfactory licensee compliance with the Limitations and Conditions
identified in Section 4.0 and further described in Section 3 of this SE.
