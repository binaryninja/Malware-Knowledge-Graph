Ragnarok ransomware gang appears to have called it quits and released the master key
that can decrypt files locked with their malware.
The threat actor did not leave a note explaining the move; all of a sudden, they replaced all
the victims on their leak site with a short instruction on how to decrypt files.

Rushed exit
The leak site has been stripped of visual elements. All that remains there is the brief text
linking to an archive containing the master key and the accompanying binaries for using it.
Looking at the leak site, it seems like the gang did not plan on shutting down today and just
wiped everything and shut down their operation.

Up until earlier today, the Ragnarok ransomware leak site showed 12 victims, added
between July 7 and August 16, threat intelligence provider HackNotice told
BleepingComputer.

By listing victims on their website, Ragnarok sought to force them into paying the ransom,
under the threat of leaking unencrypted files stolen during the intrusion.
The listed companies are from France, Estonia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Thailand, U.S.,
Malaysia, Hong Kong, Spain, and Italy and activate in various sectors ranging from
manufacturing to legal services.
Ransomware expert Michael Gillespie told BleepingComputer that the Ragnarok decryptor
released today contains the master decryption key.
“[The decryptor] was able to decrypt the blob from a random .thor file,” Gillespie told
BleepingComputer initially.
The researcher later confirmed that he could decrypt a random file, which makes the utility
a master decryptor that can be used to unlock files with various Ragnarok ransomware
extensions.

A universal decryptor for Ragnarok ransomware is currently in the works. It will soon
become available from Emsisoft, a company famed for assisting ransomware victims with
data decryption.
The Ragnarok ransomware group has been around since at least January 2020 and
claimed dozens of victims after making headlines for exploiting the Citrix ADC vulnerability
last year.
Ragnarok is not the only ransomware gang to release a decryption key this year
Ziggy ransomware operation shut down in February, and its operator shared a file with
922 keys
In May, Conti ransomware gave a free decryptor to HSE Ireland
Avaddon ransomware shut down in June and released the decryption keys
SynAck ransomware gang rebranded as El_Cometa and released the master
decryption keys as part of this transition

Researchers also provided decryptors [1, 2, 3], and sometimes the provenance of these
tools remained uncertain, as it happened with the Kaseya attack.
