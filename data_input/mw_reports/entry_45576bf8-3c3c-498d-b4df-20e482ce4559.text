Aurora Stealer Background
March 24, 2023
By Saharsh Agrawal
Aurora Stealer a non-friendly program in your neighborhood is developed in Go-lang. The
malware was developed for threat actors to steal victims’ sensitive data. Since its initial
release, there have been many adaptations to the malware. It started as a botnet having
info-stealer capabilities but currently it is a full-time info-stealer which is being sold by the
threat actor labelled Cheshire on Russian speaking dark-net forums mentioned by
cybersecurity firm Sekoia.
The malware has a knack for stealing the victim’s browser data including cookies,
passwords, login data and many more. It has the horizon to steal data from most browsers.
The stealer also targets crypto wallets to pilfer victim’s data. The malware does not stop
here, it can exfiltrate files and data stored in different software from the victim’s machine.
Once all the super-sensitive data is possessed by the stealer it delivers the data to the
attacker.
Operating Model

The malware is being spread among victims in the hospitality industry through phishing
emails as seen by Trendmirco. Besides phishing campaigns, the threat actors also have
utilized SEO poisoning technique to deliver the malware via malicious ads of notepad++
according to SANS finding.
Upon the detonation of the malware, our observations revealed the implementation of
multiple sophisticated techniques by the malware to evade detection by antivirus software.
One such technique involved the incorporation of binary padding, resulting in an increase in
the file size allowing the malware to circumvent the antivirus software and evade detection.

After successful infiltration, the malware utilizes Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI) commands to gather pertinent system information. This behavior was consistently
observed in all samples of Aurora stealer that we analyzed. Additionally, independent
research conducted by Cyble and other industry experts has reported this observation.

We also captured Aurora stealer’s actions that were aimed at extracting sensitive information
from files and folders located in various browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and drives, as
illustrated below.

Figure3: Stealing Browser and Crypto Data
Aurora leverages PowerShell to facilitate the execution of its second stage, employing the
following command:
powershell "" "start-process C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\BK2c7L9Si8.exe"

During the second stage of Aurora, an entry to the “run keys” in the registry was observed,
enabling the malware to automatically execute its third stage DLL via RUNDLL32.exe at
each user login.

Figure4: Run Key Added for DLL Execution
The third stage of the malware executes an encoded PowerShell command allowing it to
delay execution for certain duration using the following command before it exfiltrates the data
to the attacker.
C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -enc
UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAALQBTAGUAYwBvAG4AZABzACAAMwA0AA==

Once all the data and information are collected, the malware employs advanced encoding
techniques to conceal the information and prepare it for shipment to the attacker over the C2
channel. The attacker can retrieve the encoded data and use it for nefarious purposes, such
as identity theft or financial fraud.

Detection
The infernal behavior of this malware can be detected using SIGMA rules.
To begin with, we attribute different WMI commands getting executed in sequence to detect
Aurora Stealer malware.
logsource:
category: process_creation
product: windows
detection:
selection:
Image|endswith: '\wmic.exe'
CommandLine|contains:
- 'wmic os get Caption'
- 'wmic path win32_VideoController get name'
- 'wmic cpu get name'
condition: selection

One detection would be to capture changes in ‘run key’ registry which execute DLL using
RUNDLL32.exe

5/9

logsource:
product: windows
category: registry_set
detection:
selection:
EventType: SetValue
TargetObject|contains:
'\REGISTRY\MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce'
Details|re: .*rundll32.exe.C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\advpack.dll,DelNodeRunDLL32
\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\.*\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\IXP[0-9]{1,3}.TMP.*
condition: selection

Based on the general behavior followed by Aurora and different malwares, we have
developed several detection methods. We also observed changes in the configuration of
Windows Defender, where the path ‘C:\Program Data’ is excluded.
logsource:
product: windows
category: registry_set
detection:
selection:
EventType: SetValue
TargetObject|contains: '\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions'
Details: 'C:\Program Data\'
condition: selection

Another detection would be by tracing event id `5007`, which can be activated by enabling
Windows Defender operation logs. This particular event is triggered whenever there is a
modification made to the configuration of Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
logsource:
product: windows
service: windefend
detection:
selection:
EventID: 5007
NewValue|contains: 'C:\Program Data\'
condition: selection

Additionally, one clever way to detect this malware is to monitor the execution of obfuscated
PowerShell commands.
The same campaign can be detected using OSQUERY rules. Below are some rules that will
help you keep your organization safe.

query_wmic:
SELECT name,
pid,
cmdline,
path,
parent
FROM processes
WHERE LOWER(name) = 'wmic.exe'
AND
(
cmdline LIKE '%OS Get Caption%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%path win32_VideoController get name%'
OR cmdline LIKE '%cpu get name%'
);
query_regsitry:
SELECT key,
path,
name,
type,
data
FROM registry
WHERE path LIKE
'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\%'
AND data LIKE '%rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\system32\\advpack.dll,DelNodeRunDLL32
"C:\\Users\\%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\IXP%.TMP\\%';
query_exclusion:
SELECT key,
path,
name,
type,
data
FROM registry
WHERE path LIKE 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
Defender\Exclusions\Paths\%'
AND
(
data LIKE '%c:\programdata%'
OR data LIKE '%\appdata\roaming\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup%'

The above rules have been vindicated by simulating Aurora stealer in a sandbox
environment.
