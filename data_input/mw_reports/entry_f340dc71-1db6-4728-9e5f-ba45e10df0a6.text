Project TajMahal – a sophisticated new APT framework

By AMR

Executive summary
‘TajMahal’ is a previously unknown and technically sophisticated APT framework discovered by Kaspersky
Lab in the autumn of 2018. This full-blown spying framework consists of two packages named ‘Tokyo’ and
‘Yokohama’. It includes backdoors, loaders, orchestrators, C2 communicators, audio recorders, keyloggers,
screen and webcam grabbers, documents and cryptography key stealers, and even its own ﬁle indexer for
the victim’s machine. We discovered up to 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual File System,
one of the highest numbers of plugins we’ve ever seen for an APT toolset.
Just to highlight its capabilities, TajMahal is able to steal data from a CD burnt by a victim as well as from
the printer queue. It can also request to steal a particular ﬁle from a previously seen USB stick; next time
the USB is connected to the computer, the ﬁle will be stolen.
TajMahal has been developed and used for at least the past ﬁve years. The ﬁrst known ‘legit’ sample
timestamp is from August 2013, and the last one is from April 2018. The ﬁrst conﬁrmed date when TajMahal
samples were seen on a victim’s machine is August 2014.
More details about TajMahal are available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting service
(contact intelreports@kaspersky.com).

Technical details
We have discovered two different types of TajMahal packages, self-named Tokyo and Yokohama. The
targeted systems found by Kaspersky Lab were infected with both packages. This suggests that Tokyo was
used as ﬁrst stage infection, deploying the fully-functional Yokohama package on interesting victims, and
then left in for backup purposes. The packages share the same code base, we identiﬁed the following
interesting features:
Capable of stealing documents sent to the printer queue.
Data gathered for victim recon includes the backup list for Apple mobile devices.
Takes screenshots when recording VoiceIP app audio.
Steals written CD images.
Capable of stealing ﬁles previously seen on removable drives once they are available again.
Steals Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, FireFox and RealNetworks cookies.
If deleted from Frontend ﬁle or related registry values, it will reappear after reboot with a new name
and startup type.

Victims
So far we have detected a single victim based on our telemetry – a diplomatic entity from a country in
Central Asia.

Project TajMahal – a new sophisticated APT framework | Securelist

The TajMahal framework is an intriguing discovery that’s of great interest, not least for its high level of
technical sophistication, which is beyond any doubt. The huge amount of plugins that implement a number
of features is something we have never before seen in any other APT activity. For example, it has its own
indexer, emergency C2s, is capable of stealing speciﬁc ﬁles from external drives when they become
available again, etc.
The question is, why go to all that trouble for just one victim? A likely hypothesis is that there are other
victims we haven’t found yet. This theory is reinforced by the fact that we couldn’t see how one of the ﬁles
in the VFS was used by the malware, opening the door to the possibility of additional versions of the
malware that have yet to be detected.
Kaspersky Lab products detect the TajMahal APT samples as HEUR:Trojan.Multi.Chaperone.gen
