Nobelium Resource Center – updated March 4, 2021
msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/21/december-21st-2020-solorigate-resource-center/

UPDATE: Microsoft continues to work with partners and customers to expand our knowledge
of the threat actor behind the nation-state cyberattacks that compromised the supply chain of
SolarWinds and impacted multiple other organizations. Microsoft previously used ‘Solorigate’
as the primary designation for the actor, but moving forward, we want to place appropriate
focus on the actors behind the sophisticated attacks, rather than one of the examples of
malware used by the actors. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has named the
actor behind the attack against SolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP
malware, and related components as NOBELIUM. As we release new content and analysis,
we will use NOBELIUM to refer to the actor and the campaign of attacks and we have
updated references appropriate in this document below.
Alongside our industry partners and the security community, Microsoft continues to
investigate the extent of the recent nation-state attack on SolarWinds. Our goal is to
provide the latest threat intelligence, Indicators of Compromise (IOC)s, and guidance across
our products and solutions to help the community respond, harden infrastructure, and begin
to recover from this unprecedented attack. As new information becomes available, we will
make updates to this article at https://aka.ms/nobelium.

Executive Summary and Background Information
Microsoft is aware of a sophisticated supply chain attack that has targeted a variety of
victims. The attack utilized malicious SolarWinds files that potentially gave nation-state
actors access to some victims’ networks. Microsoft cybersecurity experts are investigating
the attack to help ensure that customers are as secure as possible.
