BACKGROUND
Recent events have shown that it is possible to effectively respond to a crisis. Those
that succeed call on past experience to proactively develop their readiness for
inevitable future risks. The measures they take are pre-emptive and continuous. For
organizations considering the impacts of a cyber attack, there is much to be learnt
from this “ready” mindset.
Cyber attacks are a business reality, with 75% of organizations in the UK having
experienced one between March 2019 and March 20201. However, the impact of the
attack and the damage caused, can be mitigated. Depending on an organization’s
incident response (IR) and crisis management efforts, an attack with the potential
to disrupt business continuity may have little impact. This can be achieved by
anticipating incidents and developing a response around specific threats, their
likelihood, and the motives of the attacker. It is never the result of a defensive
arsenal of technology on its own.

“There are organizations that are​spending a
ton on cyber security and they have very bad
risk postures. There are others that are not
spending very much but they have very good risk
postures. The bottom line is it’s about their level
of readiness.”​ – Paul Proctor, VP, Gartner

PROACTIVE VS REACTIVE
RESPONSE
Readiness—in the context of cyber incidents—can be understood as a
state of being and working to continually be prepared for compromise,
such that business continuity can be maintained throughout an attack.
It is both the measurement of an organization’s current security posture
and a set of actions. The latter, when improved, can increase overall
organizational resilience.
Readiness can be aligned with the “preparation” phase in the IR lifecycle
(see fig.1.), influencing all successive phases. It is broad in scope and
designed to begin as far in advance of an incident as possible; this
preparation phase may take place months or even years before an
incident. Although this preparation phase is fundamental to IR as a
practice, it is commonly overlooked.

INCIDENT READINESS IN
ACTION
The following walkthrough is based on real IR engagements and
contrasts the same attack being deployed against two near identical
organizations in the financial sector. It illustrates the success of response
with and without prior readiness activity and welcomes the reader to
make their own judgement about the value of incident readiness and
how they may apply such a mindset in their own organization.

SETTING THE SCENE
ENTERPRISE-A
Enterprise-A has a workforce of 500,000 employees, and operations
in several geographic regions. One central group security function
exists in addition to local security representatives in each regional
office. Regions are responsible for their own security function and
detection technology; no monitoring of this technology takes place
at the central security group level.
Security initiatives include penetration testing for applications,
infrastructure, and networks. Some policies and processes for IR exist,
but are not widely understood due to a lack of training.

ENTERPRISE-B
Enterprise-B is identical in profile to Enterprise-A, except that it has
recently undertaken an incident readiness project including the
following elements:
•
•
•
•
•

IR plans and playbooks developed at the regional level
First responder training in place for both group and regional staff
Tabletop incident simulation exercises carried out on a regular
basis for each region, with group security playing the role of
incident management
Review of the central logging solution that collects and
aggregates key logs, with an emphasis on logging strategy and
policy for priority assets within group and regional offices
A review of high privilege accounts and the management thereof

INCIDENT PHASE 1:
INITIAL BREACH
ENTERPRISE-A
DAY 1
The third-party developer responsible for developing and
maintaining the organization’s money transfer application contacts
a representative from head office—suspicious files have appeared
on the application servers of two regional offices. These files were
not uploaded by the development team, which is the only team with
access to the servers.

DAY 10
Group security at head office contacts the region where the
suspicious files have been identified. It transpires that the office is
receiving numerous client complaints regarding small, unrecognized
transactions from their accounts. The application owner is currently
investigating the matter but is unsure of the cause at present.

DAY 21
The developers are instructed by group security to delete the
suspicious files and report any further unusual file activity on other
regional servers.
Group security investigates the unrecognized transactions in the
transaction logs and discovers a possible authentication flaw, which
allows authentication keys to be reused. The team issues a patch and
distributes it to all regions where the application is hosted.

INCIDENT READINESS: PREPARING A PROACTIVE RESPONSE TO ATTACKS

5

ENTERPRISE-B
DAY 1
Upon receiving notification from the development team about a
suspicious file on the application servers for its money transfer
application, a ticket is raised and assigned as a low-risk priority.
An analyst from the group security team calls the developer who
raised the notification. They ask them to share their screen to enable
a two-way discussion about the suspicious nature of the file. The
servers are Linux, so the developer logs on via Secure Shell (SSH) and
prints the file contents to the shared screen.
The analyst takes note of the file contents:
#<?php
/***********************************************
********************************
* Copyright 2017 WhiteWinterWolf
* https://www.whitewinterwolf.com/tags/phpwebshell/
*
* This file is part of wwolf-php-webshell.

A quick Google search of the string “WhiteWinterWolf” confirms that
the files are web shells. The application servers are now considered
compromised, so the analyst raises the ticket priority and directs the
infrastructure team to snapshot the virtual server’s hard drives. These
snapshots are sent for forensic analysis.
Operational obligations and a lack of functional backup servers
prohibit the affected servers from being taken offline. Instead,
the analyst locates the security team’s incident playbook for host
compromise and follows the instructions to generate a hash for the
suspicious file in question. The hash is sent as part of a notification to
all regions, advising them to search for instances of the file on their
servers.

DAY 10
Further investigation leads the analyst to a string of client complaints
about unauthorized transactions on their accounts. After requesting
application transaction logs for review, they quickly identify that an
authentication key has been reused for two different accounts. This
indicates an authentication flaw in the application. As the web shell
and the unauthorized transactions are linked, the risk of the incident
is reassessed by the incident manager; the decision is made to
engage an external IR provider.
Virtual hard drive snapshots and the accompanying logs are sent to
the provider for analysis.
Whilst the hard drive snapshots and logs are processed, Enterprise-B
receives guidance from the IR provider to increase monitoring on the
affected assets. Over the next few days, a Linux endpoint detection
and response (EDR) agent and updated AV signatures are deployed
to the application servers and the logs are actively monitored by the
security team.
DAY 21
An update on the investigation thus far is received from the IR
provider. It details the following:
•
•
•
•
•

External reconnaissance activity is visible in the local server logs
A web shell was uploaded via the file upload functionality of a web
application used by the developers to upload and maintain code
on the server
Additional malware was then installed, allowing the attacker to
interact directly with the server
The attacker was able to view the transaction logs stored in
clear text on the server, where they were able to access the
authentication keys
There is some indication that the attacker is using the application
API directly from the server via the GNU Wget functionality

Group security establishes an internal cyber security incident
response team (CSIRT)2 and convenes to discuss the incident and its
remediation. Representatives are involved from every region.
It becomes clear that the attacker has a foothold on all the regional
application servers. Their objective is also clear: to extract funds by
transferring money between accounts directly from the application
servers. The initial malicious transactions of nominal amounts were
designed to assess the effectiveness of this approach.

INCIDENT READINESS: PREPARING A PROACTIVE RESPONSE TO ATTACKS

7

The CSIRT decides to issue a temporary patch, stopping the
authentication key from being reused. Monitoring on the servers is
increased while the application team builds a new application server
for distribution to the affected regions.
DAY 34
The new server image and patched application undergo a penetration
test before being deployed as the replacement in all regions.
Approval of the single server image and application version happens
quickly to avoid any further operational issues. It is imperative that all
vulnerabilities are addressed before deployment to the regions.

INCIDENT PHASE 2:
DOMAIN COMPROMISE
ENTERPRISE-A
DAY 182
An anti-virus alert is triggered on three servers in the regional office
where activity on the application servers was first observed. The
alerts indicate use of the credential harvesting tool Mimikatz3.
An administrator is assigned to log on to the affected hosts using the
local administrator account. Their attempts to identify the alerted
files are ineffectual, as they have been successfully quarantined and
are not present on disk.

DAY 190
After speaking to the administrator, the security manager concludes
that the threat has been contained by the anti-virus solution. The
administrator had attempted to extract the Windows event logs but
advised that the logs had since rolled over and were not preserved.
Every user password within the regional office network is reset as a
precaution and the investigation is closed off.

ENTERPRISE-B
Day 182
An anti-virus alert triggers an investigation into three servers in a
regional office. The regional security manager creates a ticket and
assigns it as medium risk due to the nature of the alert—that a known
hacking tool has triggered alerts on multiple servers. The security
manager instructs the administrator to take snapshots of the virtual
servers and capture the event logs as per the first responder process.
Meanwhile, the security manager reviews the access logs in the security
information and event management (SIEM) system to identify any
accounts that have recently logged on to the servers. One account
stands out as anomalous, as it belongs to a manager in the money
transfer application team. This account has never previously accessed
the servers. Despite no business case, it also has local administrator
permissions for them.
Day 183
The security manager consults the application manager, and it is
concluded that the activity was not legitimately performed by the
organization. After arranging a replacement laptop for the application
manager, the security manager takes possession of the infected laptop.
A forensic imaging tool is used to capture a disk image of the laptop
onto an encrypted external hard drive, as per the instructions in the first
responder guide.
The external hard drive and copies of the server snapshots are shipped
via courier with next-day delivery to group security for forensic
investigation. The team has already been briefed on the incident and the
incident ticket is updated with relevant details.
The password for the administrator account is reset and the affected
servers are restored from a previous backup.
Day 185
Group security forms a CSIRT with key representatives from the security,
infrastructure, and executive teams. The decision is made to engage
Enterprise-B’s external IR provider for reinforcement. The organization’s
incident manager invokes its incident response retainer and briefs the
provider’s consultants on what is known thus far. All available artifacts
are shared with the consultants for analysis.

INCIDENT READINESS: PREPARING A PROACTIVE RESPONSE TO ATTACKS

10

DAY 191
The investigation conducted by the IR consultants highlights the
following events:
•

•

•
•

•

The application manager was sent a phishing email containing a
link to a fake Linkedin profile three weeks prior to the first antivirus alerts. A two-stage payload was then downloaded onto their
host. As the user had local administrator permissions, a registry
key was used for persistence of the payload
Several randomly-named text files were found in the C:\Windows\
Temp\ directory of the laptop, which appear to be the output
of a keylogger. These include the contents of emails, as well
as passwords for internal platforms. The latter includes the
SSH password to a jumpbox that provides access to the Linux
environment where the application servers are hosted
The application manager’s credentials were then used to log on
to the three servers flagged by the anti-virus alerts
The investigation streams for the servers are ongoing. The
IR provider has so far identified a folder containing several
executable files on each server. These executables appear to have
been used by the attacker for enumeration
One such executable file named “<COMPANY_NAME>.exe”
has been submitted to the malware analysis team for reverse
engineering to scrutinize its structure and purpose. Preliminary
analysis indicates that some extracted strings have keylogging
capability and that the executable is a custom piece of malware

DAY 193
As a result of these findings, group security meets to assess the threat
and plan remediation. The consequent actions are informed by both
the findings and are in line with its domain compromise playbook:
•

•

•

Exchange administrators from each region are instructed to
search for instances of the phishing email in their regional user
base. Those regions with a proxy are instructed to search the
proxy logs for the phishing URL
A list of hashes for the files identified in the attacker’s tool folder
is sent to each regional office. It comes with instruction for the
regional security teams to use their anti-virus solution to search
for instances of these on their estates
The regional administrator for the Linux environment hosting the
money transfer application is instructed to search for instances of
logons using the compromised application manager’s credentials.

INCIDENT READINESS: PREPARING A PROACTIVE RESPONSE TO ATTACKS

11

DAY 198
While no other instances of the phishing email are found, the malware
hash search shows hits on six additional servers in the region where
the malicious files were first identified. The additional server list
includes a domain controller.
No anomalous authentication events are identified in the Linux
environment. However, it is recognized that limitations in the logging
prohibit evidence being collected across the entire period of interest.
The administrator increases the log retention policy to 60 days, resets
all user credentials, and hardens the firewall rules to ensure that only
listed IP addresses can access the Linux servers. A collection script
is run on all Linux hosts in the environment, the output of which is
shared with the IR provider for analysis.
DAY 201
Following the processes and playbook guidance defined for regional
domain compromise, group security obtains executive approval to
sever the domain trust between the affected region and head office.
The following instructions are sent to the regional security team to
eradicate the threat:
1. Restore backups of the affected servers from one month ago4
2. Reset all user and administrator passwords via Active Directory
(AD)
3. Reset the KRBTGT password as per Microsoft’s best practice guide
4. Identify additional accounts which may have excessive privileges
5. Increase monitoring for all affected assets
6. Monitor for operational impact and report back to group security
7. Schedule a domain hardening assessment with the organization’s
cyber security partner
By following these processes, Enterprise-B prevents the potential
business impact of the attack and successfully contains the incident.
It may now evaluate the incident with its IR provider and report back
to the business. As part of the lessons learned process defined in
each of the organization’s playbooks, the CSIRT conducts a meeting
to discuss the information ascertained during the incident. An action
plan to address the identified shortcomings is developed during the
meeting, and the resulting actions list is assigned to key individuals
for completion.

4 The IR provider confirms these are clean, as they predate the servers’ compromise. The executive team know that the backup restoration may cause
some business impact and loss of production data. Stakeholders are on standby to deal with any fallout.

INCIDENT PHASE 3:
ATTACKER CASH-OUT
ENTERPRISE-A
DAY 362 (ATTACKER OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED)
Enterprise-A receives an influx of reports from clients who have lost
significant sums of money through its money transfer application.
These come from multiple regions. The organization’s executive
team convenes a crisis management meeting with group security
and regional security representatives to investigate and control the
situation.
An external IR provider is engaged and briefed on the findings so
far. The provider requests the following artifacts to support the
investigation:
•
•
•

Disk images from the Linux application servers
Transaction logs from the money transfer application
Firewall logs for the Linux environment

DAY 368
As most of the application server disk images need to be couriered
from the respective regions, limited artifacts are available for analysis.
One disk image of a regional application server and some network
logs are provided initially.
Preliminary findings reveal that malware has been running on the host
for over a year. The transaction logs again show that authentication
keys have been reused in money transfers, for different accounts, via
the API on the application server. The patch issued by group security
to prevent the reuse of authentication keys was reversed by the
attacker shortly before the bulk of the transactions took place.
A timeline of key events from the attack confirms that the provided
disk image was not the first in the attack chain. The region where
the domain compromise occurred a few months prior is instead
determined as the attack’s most likely origin. This conclusion is drawn
from the timestamps of the fraudulent transactions and connections
on the firewall. Due to the time that has passed since this point, the
available historic evidence is limited.

INCIDENT READINESS: PREPARING A PROACTIVE RESPONSE TO ATTACKS

13

DAY 376
Additional disk images are received for analysis from the regional
offices, including the region suspected as the starting point for the
attack.
DAY 386
The attacker’s foothold on the Linux servers is confirmed to originate
from the corporate Windows environment, with the source of
the SSH connection being the application manager’s host. The IR
provider requests a disk image of the host, and the laptop is shipped
to head office for analysis; the absence of equipment or experience
to acquire a disk image prohibits the regional security team to do so
independently. This significantly hinders the investigation and causes
a substantial delay in the analysis process.
No connection exists between the regional application servers. The
servers in each region were individually compromised, rather than via
lateral movement. Each was compromised via web shells uploaded
via the developer’s code maintenance application, followed by the
installation of persistent malware.
The development team concedes that it could see the web shells
being created and wrote a script to delete any files matching the
names of said shells. They did not notify the organization, as they
believed appropriate mitigation steps were taken by deleting the
files.
The IR provider identifies variations of the web shells, which were not
deleted by the developer’s script. This is the mechanism that allowed
the attacker to maintain persistence on the application servers.
DAY 399
The laptop belonging to the application manager is received. It
takes the regional team a few hours to find and provide its BitLocker
recovery key, after which time the IR provider acquires a disk image
and begins analysis.
Day 416
Significant time has passed since the domain compromise, and many
laptop artifacts have rolled over or been overwritten. The IR provider
highlights that the host was compromised when the user clicked a
phishing URL. Custom malware is also running on the host as well
as the suspected output from a keylogger. Another investigation is
launched to determine if the domain controller is still compromised.

POST-INCIDENT
LEARNINGS
Following extensive forensic investigation, remediation of the
incident takes several iterations. These cause long periods of
operational downtime for Enterprise-A, impacting the business.
The investigation finds that the attacker targeted the organization
one year prior to their objectives being reached. They maintained
persistence on several key assets during this time and systematically
gathered data that would later inform and enable their final attack.
With the benefit of hindsight, three key detection events are
identified. These represent the point at which incident response
processes could have been invoked and may ultimately have resulted
in a different outcome for Enterprise-A.
Enterprise-A’s response approach is illustrated via the following
key detection events, the response action taken for each, and the
subsequent impact.

REACTIVE RESPONSE

INCIDENT READINESS: PREPARING A PROACTIVE RESPONSE TO ATTACKS

15

Following the investigation’s conclusion, critical gaps in Enterprise-A’s
readiness posture are identified. At a minimum, the following highlevel readiness measures could reduce the impact of incidents of this
nature:
•

•

•

•

The creation of an IR plan detailing relevant regulations,
thresholds, incident severity levels, escalation matrices, and
roles and responsibilities to be assumed during a cyber security
incident
The development of IR playbooks detailing high-level process
flows for different categories of incidents; these would include
incident management at the global level and incident categories
at the regional level
First responder training for regional representatives to
advocate their responsibility for preserving evidence in suitable
circumstances. This would also provide them with the skills
required to conduct initial analysis from triaged data
Incident response simulations developed and delivered
systematically to each region, encouraging buy-in from the
regional offices for the incident response plan and playbook

We can now consider what a proactive response may have looked like
for Enterprise-A had the above elements been in place at the time of
the incident:

16

Enterprises that prioritize readiness are better equipped to raise
the barriers between advanced persistent threats (APTs) and their
goals, prior to a compromise. Such threats are systematic and
require sufficient resource to succeed. By preserving key data and
developing learnings early in the kill-chain, the resource required
by the attacker diminishes the value of its persistence. Instead of
relying on prevention, and responding reactively when it fails, this
approach proactively deters threats by making an organization an
uneconomical target.

INCIDENT READINESS: PREPARING A PROACTIVE RESPONSE TO ATTACKS

17

SUMMARY AND
CONCLUSION
An organization’s ability to maintain business continuity through a
cyber incident, and recover any losses in the aftermath, is dependent
on its governance of the IR lifecycle. This includes the preparation
phase where controlled and strategic actions can be taken, based on
learnings from tabletop exercises, capability-specific assessments,
and real attacks.
Examples like the one in this paper show that preparation reaches
beyond the deployment, configuration, and testing of tooling. Whilst
suitable tooling is essential, it cannot provide incident readiness on
its own. Instead, its inclusion alongside strategic management of
people and processes—via continually-improved IR plans, playbooks,
and low-level procedures—make for an effective response
Operational resilience during a real incident is the result of skilled risk
management and the technical ability of the CSIRT, in addition to the
performance of tooling.
For the internal CSIRT managing the frontline during a compromise,
proactive response can help circumvent burnout and improve
channels of communication with the executive team. Such crossdepartmental collaboration is a step towards security becoming a
business priority.
Incidents are indeed a business consideration not a pure technical
one. The scrutiny of customers, partners, regulators, and the media
that results from an incident forms the case to develop security teams
equipped to defend against modern threat actors—both constantly
evolving and persistent in nature. The value of readiness investment
can be represented to senior stakeholders in this context as a route to
increased credibility, continuity, and growth.
