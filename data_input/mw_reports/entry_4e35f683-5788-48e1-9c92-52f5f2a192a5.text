February 1, 2022 | 8 minute read
Over the past months, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team observed an uptick in the activity
of the Iranian attributed group dubbed Phosphorus (AKA Charming Kitten, APT35),
known for previously attacking medical research organizations in the US and Israel in late
2020, and for targeting academic researchers from the US, France, and the Middle East
region back in 2019.
They have also previously targeted human rights activists, the media sector, and
interfered with the US presidential elections.
Towards the end of 2021, multiple attacks were carried out exploiting the notorious
Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities chained together and referred to as ProxyShell,
which ultimately enabled multiple threat actors to deploy malware on their targets’
networks. There have been several reports detailing the exploitation of these
vulnerabilities by Iranian state sponsored threat actors, among them the Phosphorus APT
group carrying out ransomware attacks.
Cybereason researchers recently discovered a new set of tools which were developed by
the Phosphorus group and incorporated into their arsenal, including a novel PowerShell
backdoor dubbed PowerLess Backdoor. Our research also highlights a stealthy technique
used by the group to avoid PowerShell detection by running the PowerShell Backdoor in a
.NET context rather than spawning the PowerShell process.

PowerLess Trojan: Iranian APT Phosphorus Adds New PowerShell Backdoor for Espionage

In addition, several interesting connections were found between the Phosphorus group
and the Memento Ransomware that first emerged in late 2021. (Related Iranian APT
research: StrifeWater RAT: Iranian APT Moses Staff Adds New Trojan to Ransomware
Operations).

Key Findings
Novel PowerShell Backdoor: A novel and previously undocumented PowerShell
backdoor related to the Phosphorus group was discovered by the Cybereason
Nocturnus Team and dubbed PowerLess Backdoor. It supports downloading
additional payloads, such as a keylogger and an info stealer.
Evasive PowerShell Execution: The PowerShell code runs in the context of a
.NET application, thus not launching “powershell.exe” which enables it to evade
security products.
Modular Malware: The toolset analyzed includes extremely modular, multistaged malware that decrypts and deploys additional payloads in several stages for
the sake of both stealth and efficacy.
Highly Active Infrastructure: At the time of writing this report, some of the
IOCs remained active delivering new payloads.
Wide Range of Open Source Tools: A lot of the activity observed involved a
variety of publicly available tools, such as cryptography libraries, weaponizing them
for payloads and communication encryption.
Shared IOCs with Memento Ransomware: One of the IP addresses serves a
domain which is being used as command and control (C2) for the recently
discovered Memento Ransomware.
Phosphorus Threat Group: The Phosphorus Threat Group was previously
spotted attacking research facilities in multiple regions such as the US, Europe and
the Middle East. The group is known to be behind multiple cyber espionage and
offensive cyber attacks, operating in the interest of the Iranian regime, leveraging
cyberwarfare in accordance with Iran’s geopolitical interests.
Use of Publicly Available Exploits: The Phosphorus Group was first seen
exploiting the ProxyShell vulnerability, and later on the Log4j vulnerability as well,
utilizing fresh exploits in the wild.

A Glimpse into Phosphorus Updated Arsenal
Following up on both public and non-public intelligence that is available to Cybereason in
regard to the Phosphorus threat actor, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team was able to
identify a new toolset that includes a novel backdoor, malware loaders, a browser info
stealer, and a keylogger.

It is worth noting that some of the more recent methods that were observed in attacks
attributed to the Phosphorus group included open-source tools such as the famous
DiskCryptor library and also BitLocker, along with the Fast Reverse Proxy which is used
for RDP proxying.
The following sections will detail the discovery process and analysis of the newly
identified tools.

Pivoting from a Previously Known Arsenal
The journey to the discovery of the new toolset started with threat intelligence efforts that
included pivoting on an IP address (162.55.136[.]20) that was already attributed to
Iranian threat actors by multiple sources, including US CERT.
While examining different files that were downloaded from this IP address, we stumbled
upon a file named “WindowsProcesses.exe”:

WindowsProcesses.exe hosted on the abovementioned IP
The file seems to have only been detected by 35/68 antivirus vendors, according to
VirusTotal:

This file, entitled “WindowsProcesses.exe” is a 64-bit executable loader whose sole
purpose is to resolve relevant DLLs and load another file from the “%windir%\Temp”
path entitled “dll.dll”:

Once the relevant DLLs (mostly related to .NET runtime libraries) and API calls are
resolved, dll.dll is executed:

By the looks of it, the authors could have been inspired by a code snippet found publicly
available on GitHub, which facilitates running PowerShell with CLR in native runtime.
The snippet is named “Powerless”, and the authors seem to have kept that naming
convention, as shown in the PDB path of the binary:
C:\\Users\\pugna\\Desktop\\126\\V1\\PowerLessCLR\\x64\\Release\\PowerLessCLR.pdb
Analysis of dll.dll

Dll.dll is a simple .NET AES decryptor that uses a hardcoded key “()*&3dCfabE2/123” to
decode another file named “upc” to ultimately execute PowerShell code from the
decrypted object:

The code of dll.dll
upc

The upc encrypted BLOB is decrypted using dll.dll, and contains multiple encryption
layers that all are decrypted in stages using base64 and AES ECB decryption.
The keys that are being used for decryption are as follows:
()*&3dCfabE2/123
0123654789mkiujn
25sL(*14@#SDFcgd
Prior to decrypting the PowerShell backdoor, an intermediate stage takes place when the
victim’s machine is assigned a unique identifier which is sent to the C2, which downloads
an additional configuration:

Stealing browser data
Keylogging
It is worth mentioning that the backdoor is being run within a .NET context, so therefore
it does not spawn “powershell.exe”. This behavior can be interpreted as an attempt to
evade certain PowerShell detections, although PowerShell logs are being saved on the
machine:

XDR Platform
Oddly enough, there is a part of the code in the PowerLess Backdoor, that do spawn a
powershell.exe process, when the request to kill a process is received from the C2:

It can be assumed that the native language of the backdoor’s authors is likely not English
given the abundance of typos and grammatical mistakes found in the code:

PowerLess backdoor logging
Keylogger

One of the modules downloaded by the PowerLess backdoor is a keylogger that is written
in .NET. It’s core functionality is quite simple, consisting of hooks and the logging of the
user’s keystrokes:

Stealer

Another module is a browser info stealer, which is also written in .NET, and includes the
BouncyCastle crypto library. It also uses an SQLite data reader object for Chrome and
Edge browser database files. In the staging phase, the data is encrypted and written in
JSON format for exfiltration:

Additional Tools Potentially Related to Phosphorus
In addition to the newly discovered PowerLess Backdoor, other tools were identified by
the Nocturnus Team which are suspected to originate from the same developer. However,
at this point in time there isn't enough evidence to conclusively tie these tools to
Phosphorus with a high level of confidence.
Looking at the PE info of “WindowsProcesses.exe”, the below PDB path is present:
“C:\Users\pugna\Desktop\126\V1\PowerLessCLR\x64\Release\PowerLessCLR.pdb”:

“Chromium F.exe” is yet another .NET browser info stealer. Although the code is
different, by the functionality it is similar to the abovementioned info stealer module,
leading us to assess that it might be an earlier variant:

One of the more recent tools that was allegedly from the same developer is what appears
to be an unfinished Ransomware variant. It is also written in .NET and at this point
doesn’t do anything except locking the target’s screen. As can be seen, the fields like the
ransom amount and attacker’s email are yet to be set. Although unfinished, it is worth
mentioning that the sample was uploaded from Iran via web, and it might imply yet
another step in the direction of this threat actor towards ransomware:

One of the more active IPs that was reported in the ProxyShell attacks was
148.251.71[.]182. In addition, another recent report mentions this IP address as part of an
active exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability:

Files found on the IP address 148.251.71[.]182
The “symantec” and “update” themed files all serve the FRP again. The “RCE” links, on
the other hand, serve a Java loader that distinguishes the victim machine’s operating
system and drops the appropriate version of FRP:

The Java RCE class
There are two slightly different variations of the loader, but eventually they check for the
file separator of the OS, which is “/” in case it’s Linux or “\” in Windows, and then
downloads the payload and creates persistence:

Another loader which eventually delivers FRP is PowerShell code converted to an
executable by the “Ps1 To Exe” freeware that is available for download on public forums,
where less technical people can successfully use it:

Finally, the loader creates a scheduled task for FRP, of course while being dependent on
the OS type.
A full process tree of a real time attack that exploits the ProxyShell vulnerability and
deployment of the FRP modules, can be seen below:

Once the attackers exploited the vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server, they downloaded
the FRP module, ran multiple reconnaissance commands, created persistence, dumped
credentials using a known LOLBIN technique (Comsvcs.dll), and attempted to move
laterally, as can be seen in the above Cybereason XDR Platform image.

The Memento Ransomware Connection
Another IP that appears in US CERT’s list is 91.214.124[.]143. Searching it in VirusTotal
reveals other malicious files communicating with it, as well as unique URL directory
patterns that reveal a potential connection to Memento Ransomware:
The string “gsdhdDdfgA5sS” appears to be generated by the same script as the one
listed in the Memento Ransomware IOCs: “gadfTs55sghsSSS”.
The domain “google.onedriver-srv[.]ml” was previously resolved to the IP address
91.214.124[.]143 mentioned in the US CERT alert about Iran state sponsored actors
activity:

Some of the Memento IOCs that are suspected to be related to Phosphorus
The “Connector3.exe” naming convention: as mentioned above, Phosphorus has
been observed using the FRP tool in many occasions. The file name that is used for
FRP and reported by the US CERT is “Connector3.exe”. As can be seen below, the
same name is being used to name a backdoor by Memento:

FRP named “Connector3.exe” from US CERT report

PowerLess Trojan: Iranian APT Phosphorus Adds New PowerShell Backdoor for Espionage

The activity of Phosphorus with regard to ProxyShell took place in about the same
time frame as Memento. Iranian threat actors were also reported to be turning to
ransomware during that period, which strengthens the hypothesis that Memento is
operated by an Iranian threat actor.

Conclusion
In this report, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team detailed a previously undocumented
PowerShell backdoor dubbed PowerLess, used by the Iranian APT Phosphorus in recent
attacks. This research also provided further details regarding the group’s tools and
techniques, including the use of publicly available tools and a combination of coding
languages.
The extensive usage of open source tools that is assessed to demonstrate the intermediate
coding skills of the attackers. The use of various programming languages also might point
to a lack of specialization in any specific coding language. This research also highlights
how important it is for threat intelligence analysts to “follow the breadcrumbs,” such as
pivoting on known infrastructure or the PDB paths left by the attackers in this case, in
order to pave the way for discovering additional tools and connections to other
operations.
Finally, a connection between Phosphorus and the Memento ransomware was also found
through mutual TTP patterns and attack infrastructure, strengthening the connection
between this previously unattributed ransomware and the Phosphorus group.
The Cybereason XDR Platform detects and blocks the PowerLess Trojan and other
advanced TTPs used in this operation. Cybereason is dedicated to teaming with defenders
to end attacks on the endpoint, across enterprise, to everywhere the battle is taking place.
