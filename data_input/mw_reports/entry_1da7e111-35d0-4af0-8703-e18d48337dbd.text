GhostNet (simplified Chinese: 幽灵网; traditional Chinese: 幽靈網; pinyin: YōuLíngWǎng) is
the name given by researchers at the Information Warfare Monitor to a large-scale cyber
spying[1][2] operation discovered in March 2009. The operation is likely associated with an
advanced persistent threat, or a network actor that spies undetected.[3] Its command and
control infrastructure is based mainly in the People's Republic of China and GhostNet has
infiltrated high-value political, economic and media locations[4] in 103 countries. Computer
systems belonging to embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices, and the
Dalai Lama's Tibetan exile centers in India, London and New York City were compromised.

Discovery
GhostNet was discovered and named following a 10-month investigation by the Infowar
Monitor (IWM), carried out after IWM researchers approached the Dalai Lama's
representative in Geneva[5] suspecting that their computer network had been infiltrated.[6]
The IWM is composed of researchers from The SecDev Group and Canadian consultancy
and the Citizen Lab, Munk Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto; the
research findings were published in the Infowar Monitor, an affiliated publication.[7]
Researchers from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory, supported by the
Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection,[8] also contributed to the investigation at
one of the three locations in Dharamshala, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is located.
The discovery of the 'GhostNet', and details of its operations, were reported by The New
York Times on March 29, 2009.[7][9] Investigators focused initially on allegations of Chinese
cyber-espionage against the Tibetan exile community, such as instances where email
correspondence and other data were extracted.[10]
Compromised systems were discovered in the embassies of India, South Korea, Indonesia,
Romania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan and the office
of the Prime Minister of Laos. The foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia,
Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan were also targeted.[1][11] No evidence was found
that U.S. or UK government offices were infiltrated, although a NATO computer was
monitored for half a day and the computers of the Indian embassy in Washington, D.C., were
infiltrated.[4][11][12]
Since its discovery, GhostNet has attacked other government networks, for example
Canadian official financial departments in early 2011, forcing them off-line. Governments
commonly do not admit such attacks, which must be verified by official but anonymous

1/6

sources.[13]

Technical functionality
Emails are sent to target organizations that contain contextually relevant information. These
emails contain malicious attachments, that when opened, enable a trojan horse to access
the system. This Trojan connects back to a control server, usually located in China, to
receive commands. The infected computer will then execute the command specified by the
control server. Occasionally, the command specified by the control server will cause the
infected computer to download and install a trojan known as Gh0st Rat that allows attackers
to gain complete, real-time control of computers running Microsoft Windows.[4] Such a
computer can be controlled or inspected by attackers, and the software even has the ability
to turn on camera and audio-recording functions of infected computers, enabling attackers to
perform surveillance.[7]

Origin
The researchers from the IWM stated they could not conclude that the Chinese government
was responsible for the spy network.[14] However, a report from researchers at the University
of Cambridge says they believe that the Chinese government is behind the intrusions they
analyzed at the Office of the Dalai Lama.[15]
Researchers have also noted the possibility that GhostNet was an operation run by private
citizens in China for profit or for patriotic reasons, or created by intelligence agencies from
other countries such as Russia or the United States.[7] The Chinese government has stated
that China "strictly forbids any cyber crime."[1][10]
The "Ghostnet Report" documents several unrelated infections at Tibetan-related
organizations in addition to the Ghostnet infections. By using the email addresses provided
by the IWM report, Scott J. Henderson had managed to trace one of the operators of one of
the infections (non-Ghostnet) to Chengdu. He identifies the hacker as a 27-year-old man
who had attended the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and
currently connected with the Chinese hacker underground.[16]
Despite the lack of evidence to pinpoint the Chinese government as responsible for
intrusions against Tibetan-related targets, researchers at Cambridge have found actions
taken by Chinese government officials that corresponded with the information obtained via
computer intrusions. One such incident involved a diplomat who was pressured by Beijing
after receiving an email invitation to a visit with the Dalai Lama from his representatives.[15]
Another incident involved a Tibetan woman who was interrogated by Chinese intelligence
officers and was shown transcripts of her online conversations.[14][17] However, there are
other possible explanations for this event. Drelwa uses QQ and other instant messengers to

2/6

communicate with Chinese Internet users. In 2008, IWM found that TOM-Skype, the Chinese
version of Skype, was logging and storing text messages exchanged between users. It is
possible that the Chinese authorities acquired the chat transcripts through these means.[18]
IWM researchers have also found that when detected, GhostNet is consistently controlled
from IP addresses located on the island of Hainan, China, and have pointed out that Hainan
is home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the
People's Liberation Army.[4] Furthermore, one of GhostNet's four control servers has been
revealed to be a government server.[19]
