The UK is joining likeminded partners to confirm that Chinese state-backed actors were
responsible for gaining access to computer networks around the world via Microsoft
Exchange servers.
The attacks took place in early 2021, affecting over a quarter of a million servers worldwide.
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:
The cyber attack on Microsoft Exchange Server by Chinese state-backed groups was
a reckless but familiar pattern of behaviour.
The Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to
be held account if it does not.
The attack was highly likely to enable large-scale espionage, including acquiring personally
identifiable information and intellectual property. At the time of the attack, the UK quickly
provided advice and recommended actions to those affected and Microsoft said that by end
of March that 92% of customers had patched against the vulnerability.
Today the UK is also attributing the Chinese Ministry of State Security as being behind
activity known by cyber security experts as “APT40” and “APT31”.
Widespread, credible evidence demonstrates that sustained, irresponsible cyber activity
emanating from China continues.
The Chinese government has ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead
allowing its state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks and act recklessly when
caught.

This coordinated action today sees the international community once again urge the Chinese
government to take responsibility for its actions and respect the democratic institutions,
personal data and commercial interests of those with whom it seeks to partner.
The UK is calling on China to reaffirm the commitment made to the UK in 2015 and as part of
the G20 not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property of trade
secrets.
Notes to editors
As part of a cross-Government response, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)
issued tailored advice to over 70 affected organisations to enable them successfully to
mitigate the effects of the compromise.
In 2018, the UK government and its allies revealed that elements of the Chinese
Ministry of State Security (MSS) were responsible for one of the most significant and
widespread cyber intrusions stealing trade secrets. [link]
The European Union has also made an announcement today [link].
The National Cyber Security Centre has assessed that:
Actors

Activity

NCSC Assessment

HAFNIUM

Compromising Microsoft
Exchange gave the
perpetrator a foothold to
pivot further into the IT
networks of victims.

NCSC is almost certain that the Microsoft
Exchange compromise was initiated and
exploited by a Chinese state-backed
threat actor. NCSC judge it highly likely
that HAFNIUM is associated with the
Chinese state. The attack was highly likely
to enable large-scale espionage, including
acquiring personally identifiable
information and intellectual property.

APT40,
TEMP.Periscope,
TEMP.Jumper.
Leviathan

Targeting maritime
industries and naval
defence contractors in the
US and Europe. Targeting
regional opponents of the
Belt and Road Initiative.
Targeting multiple
Cambodian electoral
entities in the run up to
the 2018 election.

NCSC judge it is highly likely that APT40
is linked to the Chinese Ministry of State
Security and operates to key Chinese
State Intelligence requirements. NCSC
judge that APT40 is highly likely
sponsored by the regional MSS security
office, the MSS Hainan State Security
Department (HSSD).

Since 2020 targeting

contractors working directly for the
Chinese Ministry of State Security.
