Like a number of online attacks and threats that took advantage of the changing work
dynamics, business email compromise (BEC) remains one of the cybercrimes that causes
the most financial losses for businesses despite the decrease in number of victims. Our
continued monitoring of BEC activities showed a consistent increase in numbers during the
year.

Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN).
The gradual increase throughout the year prompted us to pay attention to the campaigns
being deployed, but the sudden increase in August caught our interest. Compared to
campaigns from previous years in which BEC actors mostly impersonated executives or
ranking management personnel, we observed a specific BEC campaign type spoofing
general employees’ display names. We noticed a sudden upshot of dangerous emails
impersonating and targeting ordinary employees for money transfers, bank payroll account
changes, or various company-related information. We launched the “BEC Display Name
Spoofing” detection solution for Trend Micro™ Cloud App Security in Q1 to address this
issue. Following this, we also observed the highest volume of BEC detections in the
Americas.

translates as the sender asking help for a confidential financial operation and inquiring if the
recipient is available for the day.
BEC is an online scheme dependent on leveraging email and its features of convenience for
legitimate users, and we noted five major types of email channels that BEC actors use. As
we continue monitoring BEC operations, we also learnt that BEC actors can use the same
channels and techniques for a longer period than for just one deployment campaign, tracking

complaints from different spoofed and scammed victims online. We also took note of the
patterns in keywords and domain names that they use to appear legitimate to their potential
victims, and what BEC email recipients can watch for when encountering these scams.
Types of email services used for BECWe analysed the email services abused and the
techniques that BEC actors have adopted in their campaigns.

Figure 4. Email services abused for BEC deployments
1. Free email services
We observed BEC groups favouring the abuse of known free email services for the low-cost
entry. There is also the trusted marketing quality and service promise of confidentiality in
terms of protecting legitimate users, while bulk account creation tools can be used to
facilitate numerous accounts. We observed services offered by Gmail, Hotmail, and Outlook
as the top choices for BEC campaigns.
These services allow BEC actors to spoof enterprise employees’ names or personal emails
to use. In a typical case of this type of abuse, malicious actors spoof an employee email
address and request changes to payroll deposit bank accounts.

Figure 5. BEC mail from AOL (top) and Gmail (bottom)
We observed a part of the BEC chief executive officer (CEO) email fraud scheme includes
having a common account naming convention, such as “office”, “president”, “chief”, and
“director”, amongst company leadership positions. Among all these free email services,
Gmail appears to be the most commonly abused service for BEC during our investigation
timeframe. We identified 10 commonly used examples:
1. chiefexecutiveoffice <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
2. chiefexecutiveofficer <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
3. directorexecutiveofficer <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
4. officepresident <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
5. officepro <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
6. officeproject <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
7. officework <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
8. offshoreoffice <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
9. presidentoffice <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com
10. rev.office <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com

5/15

More often, BEC email content usually includes direct financial requests or transfers from the
intended victim. However, there are also indirect approaches wherein they first ask for
specific favours from the recipient. If the recipient replies, it indicates that the potential victim
believes that the sender is legitimate.

Figure 7. BEC actor requesting the victim to buy a gift card after the user replies to their first
email for a favor
We also observed some of these BEC email addresses being active from just a couple of
days to years. For example, email account cexecutive9<BLOCKED>[@]gmail.com has been
active for more than three years. We detected the address sending BEC emails in 1H 2018,
and continued to see the same email account actively sending BEC more than three years
later. We also noticed some users in social media complaining about an email scam received
from the same address.

following the said account since 2018, and observed it still being used to deploy campaigns
in 2021.
2. Local email services

6/15

Some services provide local email services for end users. BEC actors also frequently use
these services (using either compromised credentials or making new ones) to launch BEC
attacks. We observed more than 15 countries’ local email services with BEC email footprints,
such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, New
Zealand, South Korea, Ukraine, Russia, Portugal, Australia, Norway, Italy, France, and
Canada. Table 1 lists five of the email services and the BEC email sender account that we
detected:

Table 1. Sample free email services and BEC email addresses used for campaigns
We observed BEC email actors also being interested in victim's contact information or data
from companies such as ageing reports. They also try to get information from their victims for
other attacks that use social engineering.

Figure 10. BEC email asking for copies of a report and contact information
3. Encrypted email services
Like other cybercriminals, BEC actors also want to hide their footprints and prevent systems
from tracking them. Encrypted email services provide users with a higher level of privacy and
confidentiality (that is, the inclusion of other security features compared to other email
services). We observed BEC actors using some encrypted email services and list some
examples below:
Encrypted email service

Sample BEC email address

Protonmail

Tutanota

eye.adimn <BLOCKED> [@]tutanota.com

Criptext.com

iphone <BLOCKED> [@]criptext.com

Table 2. Sample encrypted email services used for BEC
These emails are not only found in the From email header, but at times also hidden in the
Reply-to section. A common trick in email scams like BECs involves forging the From header
into something legitimate-looking and hide the actors’ actual email in a hidden Reply-to.
When users directly reply just by clicking the in-mail Reply button, the Reply-to header will
automatically be the recipient email address. This is unknown to the victim and it allows the
BEC actor to communicate with the victim thereafter. The example in Figure 11 shows how a
BEC actor hides the actual email address ceoof<BLOCKED>[@]protonmail.com in the
Reply-to section.

4. Self-registered domains and direct-to featured email service
Aside from using globally known email services, BEC actors also register domains
themselves. This can bring two benefits when they conduct attacks:
1.
They can create look-alike domains to deceive victims. The actors register domains
with different characters but appear similar to a legitimate domain. Some commonly seen
tricks include the interchange between specific letters and numbers:
I (small letter L) – l (capital letter i) – 1 (for example, example.com vs. exampIe.com vs.
examp1e.com)
o – 0 (for example, trendmicro.com vs. trendmicr0.com)
d – cl (for example, trendmicro.com vs. trenclmicro.com)
m – rn (for example, example.com vs. exarnple.com)
i – j (for example, trendmicro.com vs. trendmjcro.com)
g–q
u– v
w– vv
Or the use of dashes (-) and periods (.) to separate a word or add a general postfix such as
country codes (for example, example.com vs. example-tw.com). This trick is also widely used
in other phishing schemes and other email-based scams, and will likely never get old.
2.
Control positive email authentication results such as sender policy framework (SPF) or
even DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) while sending email to victims.

Figure 12. Abusing email authentication results
While a SPF or DKIM pass does not indicate that an email is threat-free, it does provide an
image that the sender is somehow legitimate, gaining the recipient’s trust or even fool some
anti-scam solutions.
5. Stolen email credentials and email conversations

9/15

BEC actors also launch attacks from compromised email accounts. In most instances using
this technique, the malicious actors deploy a spam campaign with malicious attachments
dropping keyloggers or trojan stealers like Lokibot, Fareit, backdoor Remcos, and Negasteal
(Agent Tesla). These can steal credentials in applications like browsers, simple mail transfer
protocol (SMTP), file transfer protocol (FTP), VPNs, and from computer and system
information. The operators then harvest the credentials and try to log in to the mailbox or
webmail. If successful, they can manipulate the hacked accounts to perform BEC
deployments.
From the compromised email account, BEC actors can also find email conversations related
to finance- or purchase-themed threads such as purchase orders or invoices. Using these,
they can create other spoofed email accounts, draft a reply with the stolen conversation, and
start intercepting the conversation by replying to the recipients (usually suppliers). These are
also called man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks. In this case, BEC operators carefully study the
targeted victims, potentially compromising the companies’ email services. They will also look
for unsuspecting suppliers or other involved recipients in the original email thread.
Moreover, BEC operators use the username in the email resembling the victim’s name or
company name simultaneous to the email spoofing. In a few cases we observed, the
malicious actors use customised usernames bearing the code “god” in their email, marking
the account as a carbon copy.
<BLOCKED>mygod@mail.com
godpls<BLOCKED>@mail.com
<BLOCKED>foods@post.com
<BLOCKED>elco@dr.com
<BLOCKED>pala@dr.com
<BLOCKED>zado@dr.com
nicola<BLOCKED>@dr.com
<BLOCKED>com-int@dr.com
ire<BLOCKED>@asia.com
julien<BLOCKED>@mail.com

10/15

Figure 13. Sample BEC email with a stolen conversation used to deploy a BEC attack.
The BEC actors can rent virtual private servers (VPS) with SMTP and remote desktop
protocol (RDP) services. They can use email marketing software like Gammadyne Mailer to
craft spam mails and send it to thousands of email addresses. These email addresses are
harvested via tools such as Email Extractor Lite, while some come from spam activities. The
actors can then review the stealer logs and identify mail servers of interest, which can
contain conversations about purchasing orders. They can then hijack the email conversation,
create spoofed emails, and use the conversation to deploy a BEC attack. Another method
employed involves the tampering of the invoice document to reflect the BEC actors’ bank
account details. Thus, if there is a request for a wire transfer the money will go directly into
their account.
Keyword use and naming patterns
We also observed some keywords or naming patterns that BEC actors generally use. We
identified some of them and provide examples for each.
1. Lengthy domain names with dashes (-)

11/15

A group of BEC domains operating from Africa was observed to favour lengthy names, using
new generic top-level domain (TLD) words such as “[.]management”, “[.]work”, or “[.]one”.
Some domains also contain “-“ and with common keywords such as “management”, “mail”,
“office”, “reply”, and “secure”. We list examples that we observed here:
admin-office-mail-server-ssl0.management
reply-netsuite-mails.management
system-mail-protection-outlook.management
replys-mail-netsuite-com.management
systerm-proctection-outlook.management
mails-officesslappssecure-serversportal-execs.management
reply-workplace-secure-protection-management-office.one
servermail-reply-office-works-secure-protecty-inbound-netsuite.one
office-xlsx-appspts-management-worksmailxls-cs.rest
office-mails-appsslz-workmail-management.work

Figure 14. A BEC email using lengthy keywords and dashes
2. The use of telecom keywords
We also noticed BEC actors registering domain names with telecommunications industryrelated keywords such as “5g”, “4g”, “mobile”, “network”, and “wireless”. They occasionally
include names of service providers such as “Verizon” and “T-Mobile.” It’s also common to see
dashes in domain names to increase the diversity of choices while registering:
5g-verizou.com
network-sprint.biz
sprint-mobile.net
mobile-celldata.online.
verizon-private-wireless.com
reply-tmobile.com
tmobilecellular.space
5g-tmobile.com
t-mobile4g-us.com
verizone4g-device.com
12/15

Figure 15. A BEC email using telecom-related domains
When we tracked “TELE-COMM” naming BEC domains’ email infrastructure (observed from
the domain name system mail exchanger or DNS MX records), we checked several
commercial email services such as Google Workspace (aspmx.l.google.com) and
Titan[.]email. These commercial email services provide advanced features like email
tracking, scheduled sending, and follow-up reminders, and it is highly likely that BEC
operators also optimise their operations’ flow in leveraging these services.

Figure 16. Email services like Titan provide advanced features for tracking the progress of
emails sent
Below is an example of a BEC email initiating a conversation, wherein spaces are inserted in
between words in the subject line. The word “INVOICE” is replaced with “I NVOICE” to
evade anti-scam email solutions that rely on keywords or regular
expressions. Similar tricks have been observed in sextortion and phishing email schemes.

Conclusion
Unlike other cybercriminal schemes, phishing and BEC scams can be tricky to detect as they
are targeted toward specific recipients. Attackers seek to compromise email accounts to gain
access to financial and other sensitive information related to business operations, and BEC
actors can easily use such access and information for other illicit activities. In the sample
routines discussed here, the attackers’ emails themselves do not include the typical malware
payload of malicious attachments. As a result, traditional security solutions will not be able to
protect accounts and systems from such attacks.
From our observations, BEC attacks don’t only target high-profile users but also any
employee that can be found on social media networks with significant personal information
published (such as LinkedIn). These pieces of information can be used to spoof employees
and partners, and cause significant financial damage to businesses.
As we observed professional email services being used for BEC attacks, we believe BEC
actors will keep adopting new services and tools to optimise their operations flow as email
services try to optimise services for their legitimate users. Targets in the Americas and
Europe will continue to be targeted as sources of profit for these scams and will likely
continue as companies see remote work becoming more mainstream, whether it be for their
own operations or their managed service providers’ (MSPs). Companies and employees will
have to keep their guard up to mitigate the risks from BEC and other email-based scams:
Educate and train employees. Deflect company intrusions through continuous InfoSec
education. All company personnel — from the CEO to rank-and-file employees — must
be aware of the various techniques and kinds of scams, and the procedure to follow
when they encounter an attack attempt.

Confirm requests using other channels. Avoid clicking on embedded links or directly
replying to the email addresses used in the email. Exercise caution by following a
verification system amongst employees who handle sensitive information, such as
multiple personnel sign-off or additional verification protocols.
Scrutinize all emails. Be wary of irregular emails with suspicious content such as
unknown and dubious sender emails, domain names, writing styles, and urgent
requests. Report suspicious emails to the respective security and InfoSec teams for
analysis, tracking, and blocking.
