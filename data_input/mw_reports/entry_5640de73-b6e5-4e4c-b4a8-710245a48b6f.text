The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

Summary
DanaBot is an ever-evolving and prevalent threat that has been in the wild since 2018. The
malware has seen a resurgence in late 2021 after it was found several times in hijacked
packages of NPM, a popular JavaScript software package manager for Node.JS.
Sold as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering, DanaBot initially focused on banking fraud
and information stealing. However, over the years it has matured in complexity and grown in
functionality.
One such functional shift was seen in late October 2021, when an affiliate using the
malware dropped via the hijacked NPM packages was involved in a distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS) attack against a commercial organization based in Russia.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
The DanaBot malware has seen great success as a MaaS platform, allowing other threat
actors to carry out their own desired malicious goals. Since its creation in 2018, threat
actors who purchased the malware have been given specific botnet identification for the
MaaS, known as affiliate IDs. These IDs signify different campaigns, threat actors, and
potentially different targets. Throughout its life, DanaBot has been used in a wide range of
campaigns, and its delivery has changed and evolved as well.

Evolution of Delivery
Phishing and Spam
Historically, the malware was used in phishing and malspamming campaigns. DanaBot
relied on social engineering tactics of varying complexity to bait victims into following
unknown links attached to emails, and inadvertently downloading the malware.
Over time, DanaBot has focused more on deployment via traditional malspam. This threat
has had some noteworthy success since shifting tactics to using low-volume spear-phishing
campaigns that target specific victims with a finer degree of complexity and social
engineering, to make it seem more trustworthy to its targets.
As the malware has evolved, DanaBot began to further its reach by utilizing webinjects to
harvest victim email addresses. Webinjects are malicious display fields or overlays that are
injected onto webpages open on the victim’s browser. These fields are filled by the user,
who thinks they are filling out their regular login page, and this information is then stolen by
the malware. Historically, malware such as DanaBot has displayed such fields over email,
social networking, and banking log-on pages to steal these user credentials.
DanaBot has since used addresses stolen by webinject to further its spam email campaigns
and spread its reach.

Compromised and Cracked Websites
More recently, DanaBot has been hosted and distributed via webpages offering cracked
software and applications. Cracked software is “closed-source” software-for-pay that has
been exploited to allow people who use the “crack” to have full access to what would
normally be paid functionality and features, without paying licensing fees or an initial upfront cost.
Threat actors commonly deploy their Trojanized executables by bundling them with cracked
software as a lure for victims to unknowingly download and execute malicious software.
Malware that is distributed this way often targets a particular demographic of users who
may be less security-conscious, such as people who are seeking software that is either illicit
or illegal, depending on the jurisdiction where they live.
Compromised Packages
Late in 2021, the NPM JavaScript software package manager for Node.JS had a handful of
its libraries compromised and infected with malware. It was later ascertained that the
malware in question was DanaBot.
In October 2021, the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a
warning about malware being discovered in three versions of the NPM "ua-parser-js"
package. Users who downloaded and executed the hijacked package were infected with
DanaBot, along with a cryptocurrency miner.
In November 2021, NPM statedNPM stated via Twitter that it had been hijacked once again.
A compromised account was used to publish and push malicious code to two further
packages: first "coa," and then "rc."
Malicious “Rc" and "Coa" Packages
Though both coa and rc had not been updated for several years, both still receive
thousands of downloads daily. The presence of malicious code in these packages was
discovered by someone who had used the coa package, and then subsequently reported
errors in various builds. This strange behavior prompted further investigation, which led to
the discovery of the maliciously injected code. NPM released a statement explaining that all
Windows® users who had recently downloaded either package should consider their
systems compromised.
Analyzing the contents of a compromised version of the package “rc-1.3.9,” we can see the
malicious scripts added to the package (highlighted in red).

Figure 1: Contents of rc-1.3.9
Inspecting the contents of the affected package rc-1.3.9, we found that the files
“compile.bat” and “compile.js” were compromised and contained malicious code. Both
compromised versions of coa and rc share identical malicious Windows Batch and
JavaScript scripts.
When installing, both packages will first execute and run the file compile.js via Node, as
seen below:

Figure 2: Obfuscated compile.js
On execution, this JavaScript code will launch the secondary malicious script, which is a
Windows batch file (.BAT) called compile.bat. This batch file acts as a downloader for the
malware.

The content of compile.bat is initially obfuscated, but it can be deobfuscated to reveal the
true intention of this malicious code.

Figure 3: Obfuscated compile.bat
Once deobfuscated, we can see that it attempts to download a .DLL named "sdd.dll" from
an unknown domain, and outputs it as “compile.dll.” If successful, the malicious .DLL will be
executed via "Regsvr32.exe,” which is a command-line utility in Microsoft® Windows® that
is commonly used for registering DLLs in the Windows Registry.

The DLL will attempt to make contact with185[dot]117[dot]90[dot]36:443 before eventually
launching the malware once again, via rundll32.exe.
The malware will then rerun using a Base64 encoded export. This export is calculated by
DanaBot to determine which mode the malware is running in. This is done by subtracting
the first three bytes of export, as follows.

Capabilities and Commands
DanaBot is mainly used for its information-stealing functionality and modular flexibility. The
malware made its last iterative change at the end of 2020, and then made additional
changes in September 2021.
All communication between the malware and its command-and-control (C2) server is
encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), including the following activities and
commands:
Initial call-home beaconing to its C2
Updating its C2 list
Switching to using a Tor-based C2
Beginning information-stealing
Reporting/listing system information
Reporting/listing hardware information
Taking screenshots of victim device
Remote Access Trojan (RAT) functionality
Keylogging
Remote screen recording
Requesting updates

DDOS
In late October 2021, machines affected with samples of DanaBot that were dropped via the
hijacking of ua-parser were involved in a DDoS attack. The affected devices received
further malicious instructions to target a specific commercial organization based in Russia.
This event highlights the flexibility of the malware beyond its historic information-stealing
functionality.

Collaboration
6/10

Historically, DanaBot has not operated alone. In the past, it has worked with other malware
families once on a victim’s device to add to the overall damage caused. For example, this
threat has been seen working in collaboration with GootKit, which was once a popular
banking Trojan first found in the wild in 2014. Though seemingly not updated since 2019,
GootKit has recently become active again.
There are no signs yet that point to this partnership reforging.

Conclusion
At its heart, DanaBot is a complex and modular information-stealer, focusing on harvesting
victim credentials and other valued logins. The malware has the ability to perform webinjects on popular services, as well as having remote access functionality. This allows the
malware to gather a wealth of information about a compromised victim’s device, which can
be further used in secondary attacks.
Seemingly on the decline over recent years, the past year has sparked new life and a return
to the mainstream for DanaBot. This threat is part of an evolving malware family, with
frequent enhancements to both communication, attack vector, and functionality.
With a recent spike in activity and a new attack vector via the recent hijacking of NPM
packages, it is clear that this Malware-as-a-Service is still under development. Coupled with
its utilization in recent DDoS attacks and NPM hijacks, the threat of DanaBot is as prevalent
as ever.
NOTE: Users who have recently utilized NPM packages are likely to have
compromised machines. They should patch such packages immediately and check
for artifacts of DanaBot.
