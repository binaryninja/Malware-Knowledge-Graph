Emotet Malware Infected More than 1.6 Million Victim Computers and
Caused Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Damage Worldwide
The Justice Department today announced its participation in a multinational operation
involving actions in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the
United Kingdom to disrupt and take down the infrastructure of the malware and botnet known
as Emotet. Additionally, officials in Lithuania, Sweden, and Ukraine assisted in this major
cyber investigative action.
“The Emotet malware and botnet infected hundreds of thousands of computers throughout
the United States, including our critical infrastructure, and caused millions of dollars in
damage to victims worldwide,” said Acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin. “Cyber
criminals will not escape justice regardless of where they operate. Working with public and
private partners around the world we will relentlessly pursue them while using the full arsenal
of tools at our disposal to disrupt their threats and prosecute those responsible.”
According to an unsealed search warrant affidavit, Emotet is a family of malware that targets
critical industries worldwide, including banking, e‑commerce, healthcare, academia,
government, and technology. Emotet malware primarily infects victim computers through
1/4

spam email messages containing malicious attachments or hyperlinks. Emails were
designed to appear to come from a legitimate source or someone in the recipient’s contact
list. Once it has infected a victim computer, Emotet can deliver additional malware to the
infected computer, such as ransomware or malware that steals financial credentials.
Ransomware, in particular, has increased in scope and severity in the past year, harming
businesses, healthcare providers, and government agencies even as the country has
struggled to respond to the pandemic.
“The coordinated disruption of Emotet was a great success for the FBI and our international
partners,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The FBI utilized sophisticated techniques, our
unique legal authorities, and most importantly, our worldwide partnerships to significantly
disrupt the malware. The operation is an example of how much we can achieve when we
work with our international law enforcement partners to combat the cyber threat. The FBI
remains committed, now more than ever, to imposing risk and consequences on cyber
criminals to put an end to this type of criminal activity.”
The computers infected with Emotet malware are part of a botnet (i.e., a network of
compromised computers), meaning the perpetrators can remotely control all the infected
computers in a coordinated manner. The owners and operators of the victim computers are
typically unaware of the infection.
“Cybercrime transcends physical and political boundaries and costs U.S. citizens and
businesses billions each year,” said U.S. Attorney Matt Martin of the Middle District of North
Carolina. “That was certainly true with Emotet. Now, more than ever, international
collaboration is an imperative as we employ a technically and legally sophisticated approach
to thwart cybercriminals in whatever corner of the globe they are found. This investigation will
be a paradigm for effective international law enforcement cooperation directed at global
cybercrime, and we applaud the FBI and the international law enforcement partners who
contributed to the effort to take down this global threat.”
According to the affidavit, in 2017, for example, the computer network of a school district in
the Middle District of North Carolina was infected with the Emotet malware. The Emotet
infection caused damage to the school’s computers, including but not limited to the school’s
network, which was disabled for approximately two weeks. In addition, the infection caused
more than $1.4 million in losses, including but not limited to the cost of virus mitigation
services and replacement computers. From 2017 to the present, there have been numerous
other victims throughout North Carolina and the United States, to include computer networks
of local, state, tribal, and federal governmental units, corporations, and networks related to
critical infrastructure.
“The Emotet malware quickly elevated to one of the top cyber threats in the world,” said
Special Agent in Charge Robert R. Wells of the FBI Charlotte Field Office. “The strong
relationships with international law enforcement partners were critical to the success of this

2/4

FBI investigation which began with a small North Carolina school system that did the right
thing and quickly contacted their local FBI office for help.”
According to the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Emotet
infections have cost local, state, tribal, and territorial governments up to $1 million per
incident to remediate. More information about the malware, including technical information
for organizations about how to mitigate its effects, is available from CISA here: https://uscert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A.
According to the affidavit, foreign law enforcement agents, working in coordination with the
FBI, gained lawful access to Emotet servers located overseas and identified the Internet
Protocol addresses of approximately 1.6 million computers worldwide that appear to have
been infected with Emotet malware between April 1, 2020, and Jan. 17, 2021. Of those, over
45,000 infected computers appear to have been located in the United States.
Foreign law enforcement, working in collaboration with the FBI, replaced Emotet malware on
servers located in their jurisdiction with a file created by law enforcement, according to the
affidavit. This was done with the intent that computers in the United States and elsewhere
that were infected by the Emotet malware would download the law enforcement file during an
already-programmed Emotet update. The law enforcement file prevents the administrators of
the Emotet botnet from further communicating with infected computers. The law enforcement
file does not remediate other malware that was already installed on the infected computer
through Emotet; instead, it is designed to prevent additional malware from being installed on
the infected computer by untethering the victim computer from the botnet.
The scope of this law enforcement action was limited to the information installed on infected
computers by the Emotet operators and did not extend to the information of the owners and
users of the computers.
According to the affidavit, in coordination with foreign law enforcement officials, FBI
personnel also gained lawful access to an Emotet distribution server located overseas and
identified several servers worldwide that were used to distribute the Emotet malware. These
servers were typically compromised web servers belonging to what appear to be unknowing
third parties. The perpetrators uploaded the Emotet malware to the servers through
unauthorized software applications. Victims who clicked on spam email messages containing
malicious attachments or hyperlinks would then download the initial Emotet malware file from
a distribution server.
In addition, according to the affidavit, FBI personnel notified more than 20 U.S.-based
hosting providers that they hosted more than 45 IP addresses that had been compromised
by the perpetrators associated with the Emotet malware and botnet. FBI Legal Attachés
further notified authorities in more than 50 countries that hosting providers in their respective
jurisdictions hosted hundreds of IP addresses that were compromised by Emotet.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of North Carolina, the FBI Charlotte
Division, and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section
(CCIPS) conducted the operation in close cooperation with Europol and Eurojust who were
an integral part of coordination and messaging, and investigators and prosecutors from
several jurisdictions, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, France’s National Police
and Judicial Court of Paris, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police and General Public
Prosecutor’s Office Frankfurt/Main, Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau, Netherlands National
Police and National Public Prosecution Office, Swedish Police Authority, National Police of
Ukraine and Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, and the United Kingdom’s National
Crime Agency and Crown Prosecution Service. The Justice Department’s Office of
International Affairs and the U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network (FinCEN) also provided significant assistance. CCIPS Senior Counsel Ryan K.J.
Dickey and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eric Iverson and Anand Ramaswamy of the Middle
District of North Carolina led the U.S. efforts.

In September 2020, FBI Director Christopher Wray announced the FBI’s new strategy for
countering cyber threats. The strategy focuses on imposing risk and consequences on cyber
adversaries through the FBI’s unique authorities, world-class capabilities, and enduring
partnerships. Victims are encouraged to report the incident online with the Internet Crime
Complaint Center (IC3) www.ic3.gov. For more information on ransomware prevention, visit:
