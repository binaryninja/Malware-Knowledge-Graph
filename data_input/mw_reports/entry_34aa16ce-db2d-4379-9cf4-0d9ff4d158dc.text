A new ransomware called RegretLocker uses a variety of advanced features that allows it
to encrypt virtual hard drives and close open files for encryption.
RegretLocker was discovered in October and is a simple ransomware in terms of
appearance as it does not contain a long-winded ransom note and uses email for
communication rather than a Tor payment site.

When encrypting files, it will append the innocuous-sounding .mouse extension to
encrypted file names.

What it lacks in appearance, though, it makes up for in advanced features that we do not
usually see in ransomware infections, as described below.

RegretLocker mounts virtual hard disks
When creating a Windows Hyper-V virtual machine, a virtual hard disk is created and stored
in a VHD or VHDX file.
These virtual hard disk files contain a raw disk image, including a drive's partition table and
partitions, and like regular disk drives, can range in size from a few gigabytes to terabytes.
When a ransomware encrypts files on a computer, it is not efficient to encrypt a large file as
it slows down the entire encryption process's speed.
In a sample of the ransomware discovered by MalwareHunterTeam and analyzed by
Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, RegretLocker uses an interesting technique of mounting a
virtual disk file so each of its files can be encrypted individually.
To do this, RegretLocker uses the Windows Virtual Storage API OpenVirtualDisk,
AttachVirtualDisk, and GetVirtualDiskPhysicalPath functions to mount virtual disks.

Mounting a VHD file
As shown by a debug message in the ransomware, it is specifically searching for VHD and
mounting them when detected.
parse_files() | Found virtual drive: %ws in path: %s

Once the virtual drive is mounted as a physical disk in Windows, the ransomware can
encrypt each one individually, which increases the speed of encryption.
The code used by RegretLocker to mount a VHD is believed to have been taken from a
recently published research by security researcher smelly__vx.
In addition to using the Virtual Storage API, RegretLocker also utilizes the Windows Restart
Manager API to terminate processes or Windows services that keep a file open during
encryption.
When using this API, Kremez told BleepingComputer if the name of a process contains
'vnc', 'ssh', 'mstsc', 'System', or 'svchost.exe', the ransomware will not terminate it. This
exception list is likely used to prevent the termination of critical programs or those used by
the threat actor to access the compromised system.

Windows Restart Manager exception list
The Windows Restart Manager feature is only used by a few ransomware such as REvil
(Sodinokibi), Ryuk, Conti, ThunderX/Ako, Medusa Locker, SamSam, and LockerGoga.
RegretLocker is not very active at this point, but it is a new family that we need to keep an
eye on.
