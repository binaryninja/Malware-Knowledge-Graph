Joint media release with:
The Hon Karen Andrews MP, Minister for Home Affairs
The Hon Peter Dutton MP, Minister for Defence
19 July 2021
Today, the Australian Government joins international partners in expressing serious concerns
about malicious cyber activities by China's Ministry of State Security.
In consultation with our partners, the Australian Government has determined that China's
Ministry of State Security exploited vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Exchange software to
affect thousands of computers and networks worldwide, including in Australia. These actions
have undermined international stability and security by opening the door to a range of other
actors, including cybercriminals, who continue to exploit this vulnerability for illicit gain.

The Australian Government is also seriously concerned about reports from our international
partners that China's Ministry of State Security is engaging contract hackers who have
carried out cyber-enabled intellectual property theft for personal gain and to provide
commercial advantage to the Chinese Government.
Australia calls on all countries – including China – to act responsibly in cyberspace. China
must adhere to the commitments it has made in the G20, and bilaterally, to refrain from
cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and confidential business
information with the intent of obtaining competitive advantage.
Since 2017, Australia has publicly attributed malicious cyber activity to North Korea, Russia,
China and Iran. Most recently, Australia joined more than 30 international partners to hold
Russia to account for its harmful cyber campaign against SolarWinds. Australia calls out
these malicious activities to highlight the significant risk they can pose to Australia's national
security or to international stability, which in turn can undermine business confidence and
inclusive economic growth.
Australia's cyber security posture is strong, but there is no room for complacency given the
online threat environment is constantly evolving. Protecting Australia from malicious cyber
activity – be it by state actors or cybercriminals – requires a continuous improvement
approach to cyber security practices across all levels of society including government,
business and households.
The Australian Government will continue to work with international partners and the private
sector to strengthen cyber security, including through the implementation of Australia's Cyber
Security Strategy 2020 and Australia's International Cyber and Critical Technology
Engagement Strategy. All Australians are encouraged to visit cyber.gov.au for advice on
how to protect themselves online.
