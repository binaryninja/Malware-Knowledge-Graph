EclecticIQ researchers observed multiple weaponized phishing emails probably targeting the
Security Service of Ukraine (SSU), NATO allies like Latvia, and private companies such as
Culver Aviation.

EclecticIQ Threat Research Team – February 16, 2023

Executive Summary

4/17

EclecticIQ researchers observed multiple weaponized phishing emails probably targeting the
Security Service of Ukraine (SSU), NATO allies like Latvia, and private companies such as
Culver Aviation - a Ukrainian aviation company. Multiple overlaps between these incidents
and previous attacks of the Gamaredon APT group (4), such as command and control
infrastructures and adversary techniques, helped analysts to highly likely attribute these
latest attacks to the Gamaredon group.
This report describes three distinct cases and adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs). Analysts examined three different malware delivery techniques used in this
campaign, including spear phishing with a TAR attachment that contains a malicious LNK
file, a specially crafted Word document that can exploit CVE-2017-0199 to gain code
execution without macros, and HTML smuggling.
EclecticIQ researchers continue to actively monitor for activity related to the Gamaredon APT
group. While monitoring this activity, analysts identified multiple key findings:
Phishing emails were being used to deliver malware to the Security Service of Ukraine.
In January 2023, EclecticIQ researchers observed English and Latvian-language
phishing lures probably targeting NATO allies.
Analysts assess that Culver Aviation (a Ukrainian aviation company) probably has been
targeted by multiple phishing lures containing malicious Word documents that use the
CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, which is exploited to execute the malware on victim
systems through specially crafted Word documents.
According to open-source reporting, Culver Aviation Company provided multiple
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support Ukrainian troops in the region. This
support highly likely has made the company a target in this latest cyberattack.
Living off the Land Binaries (LOLBAS) such as MSHTA.exe were being actively abused
by a Russian state-sponsored threat actor to download and execute the second stage
of the malware.

Case #1: Phishing Emails to Target the Security Service of Ukraine
(SSU)
Malware Execution Flow
On January 23rd, 2023, EclecticIQ analysts identified a phishing email - addressed to the
Security Service of Ukraine - with an attached archive file (TAR). The TAR folder contained a
malicious shortcut (LNK) file.
Upon user click, the LNK file downloads and executes a second-stage malicious HTML
application (HTA) from a remote address using MSHTA.exe.

5/17

The threat actor appears to be using multiple techniques to limit who can access this URL
outside of Ukraine. For example, the threat actor uses geo-blocking to limit downloads of this
malicious file from other locations and blocks ExpressVPN and NordVPN nodes within
Ukraine. It appears the threat actor is potentially conducting additional filtering to further
control access to payloads.

Figure 1 – Malware execution flow.
The Attack Begins with a Phishing Email Campaign

Figure 2 shows a recent phishing email with a malicious attachment probably targeting the
Security Service of Ukraine (SSU). At the bottom of the email is the attached TAR file.

Figure 2 – Example of Phishing email probably targeting SSU.
Victim User Clicks on the Malicious Shortcut (LNK) File

When a victim user extracts the TAR file (as seen in figure 3) it contains the malicious LNK
file with a Latvian phishing lure.

6/17

Figure 3 – Content of malicious attachment translated to English from the Ukrainian
language.
LNKs are Windows shortcut files that can contain malicious code to abuse legitimate tools on
the system, the so-called living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBAS or LOLBIN). Figure 4 (below)
shows that the actor uses MSHTA (a process used by Windows in legitimate purposes to
execute HTML applications) to download and execute Microsoft HTML Application (HTA)
files from a remote URL defined inside the Target section of the LNK file.

Figure 4 – Malicious shortcut (LNK) file.
Execution of the Malicious HTA File

If a victim clicks on the malicious LNK file, it will start to download an HTA file from the
remote address (hxxp[://]194[.]180[.]174[.]203/23[.]01/mo/baseball[.]DjVu) and execute this
second stage malware via MSHTA.exe. Analysts were unable to retrieve the second stage
payload due the remote server being offline.

Case #2: Targeting Culver Aviation via a Phishing Lure to Exploit
CVE-2017-0199
On December 12th, 2022, EclecticIQ researchers identified multiple malicious Word
documents that used Culver Aviation phishing lures. Analysts assess that the chances are
about even that threat actor is targeting Culver Aviation Company or other Ukrainian entities
using this company’s name. Analysts suspect the threat actor’s interest in Culver Aviation
probably stems from that company providing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to Ukrainian
troops (11).

7/17

One of those Word documents can be seen in figure 5. This Ukrainian-language Word
document contains the name of Culver Aviation’s CEO, corporate email address, and title of
the company as a part of the lure.

Figure 5 – Malicious Word document that contains Culver Aviation phishing lure (6).
The Malicious Word document leverages the exploit CVE-2017-0199 to download and
execute remote templates as a second stage of the malware. This exploit can be triggered
by opening the Word document without any macro involvement.
Figure 6 shows the remote template URL (council7[.]artupora[.]ru), which hosts a malicious
HTA file that is stored in the Word document. This URL has been attributed to Gamaredon by
previous reporting (8).

Case #3: Latvian (Ministry of Defence) MoD and Probably Other
NATO Allies Targeted via an HTML Smuggling Campaign
On January 18th, 2023, EclecticIQ researchers identified a threat actor group using phishing
lures in English and Latvian, almost certainly to target the Latvian MoD and probably other
English-speaking NATO allies.

8/17

In this new campaign, an HTML Smuggling technique was actively used for malware delivery
shown in figure 7. HTML smuggling lets an attacker “smuggle” an encoded malicious script
within a specially crafted HTML attachment or web page. When a target user opens the
HTML in their web browser, the browser decodes the malicious script, which, in turn,
assembles the malicious payload on the host device. Instead of having a malicious
executable pass directly through a network, the attacker builds the malware locally behind a
firewall.

Figure 7 - HTML Smuggling used to deliver the Malicious LNK file decoyed as PDF file.
The email in figure 8, impersonated the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence and targeted the
Latvian Ministry of Defence, the domain name (admou[.]org) was used to send their phishing
email.

9/17

Figure 8 - Phishing email addressed to the Latvian MoD containing HTML file as a malicious
attachment. (2)
The infection flow is very similar to case 1 (Security Service of Ukraine). The threat actor
abuses MSHTA.exe to download an HTA file from the remote URL
(hxxp[://]194[.]180[.]174[.]158/18[.]01/released[.]rtf.) to retrieve the second stage payload.

Figure 9 - HTML Smuggling used to deliver malicious LNK file (3).
10/17

Figure 10 shows the content of the LNK file, it uses the same infrastructure (AS 39798 MivoCloud SRL) described in case 1 but with a different IP address to download second
stage malware.

Figure 10 – Malicious LNK file.
When the victim system is successfully infected by this malware, the threat actor can get
persistence on the system and then proceed with executing their action on objectives.
EclecticIQ researchers believe that military and related organizations in Ukraine and other
NATO allies were being targeted by a Russian state-sponsored APT group specifically for
collecting intelligence that very likely benefit Russian troops in Ukraine.

Overlaps Between These Cases and Previous Gamaredon Attacks
The adversary tactics and techniques such as malware delivery mechanisms, malware
execution techniques, and infrastructures share strong similarities with activity attributed to
Gamaredon, originally reported by Palo Alto Networks in December 2022 (4). Palo Alto

11/17

Networks linked the activity cluster to Gamaredon - a threat actor that the Ukrainian
government attributed to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). Each of these three
overlapping techniques is explained below.
Victimology

According to the Ukrainian government, this threat group was performing cyber-attacks on
Ukrainian government entities since 2014 (9). Also in 2022, CERT-UA confirmed phishing
emails were being used to send malicious files to the Latvian government and likely targeting
other European governments (12).
Updated HTML Smuggling Technique

Gamaredon group commonly uses the HTML smuggling technique for delivering malware
(9). In this new campaign the threat actors improved the obfuscation routine in the HTML
smuggling code (figure 11) to avoid anti-malware scanners and email gateway solutions.

Figure 11– Obfuscation update for HTML smuggling (2).
Second Stage Malware Execution and Delivery Technique:

12/17

In Figure 12, a malware sample uploaded to VirusTotal (5) at 2022-12-01 05:45:19 UTC and
was attributed to Gamaredon APT by Unit 42 threat research group (4). The researchers
noted that the malware used the (admou[.]org) domain in the attack. In latest cyberattacks
against Latvia, the same domain name was used by threat actor as an email sender (10).

Figure 12 - Malicious LNK file used to download and execute HTA file format by abusing
mshta.exe
Infrastructure of the Threat Actor:

When a user clicks on the LNK file mentioned in Figure 13, it will try to download a malicious
HTA file from https://admou[.]org/29.11_mou/presented[.]rtf.
URL syntax used in the malware delivery and C2 communications are identical to previous
attacks researched by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks (4).

Figure 13 – Brief example of command-and-control sequence, same system used in this
latest attack
13/17

Most of the threat actor´s domains continue to be registered under the Russian Domain
Registrar reg[.]ru. To date, no action has been taken to block the malicious infrastructure. It is
very likely that the threat actor chooses this infrastructure on Russian soil to avoid being
defaced by law enforcement or disruption of their offensive operations by VPS service
provider.
The infrastructure outside of Russia is probably used to avoid geo-blocking during cyberattacks against western countries and it has relied primarily on VPS providers located within
one of 3 autonomous systems (AS), AS14061 (DigitalOcean, LLC), AS 207713 (Global
Internet Solutions LLC) and AS 39798 (MivoCloud SRL).

Conclusion
Since 2014, Russian government-backed threat actors have been conducting hybrid
aggression against Ukraine and NATO allies to perform sabotage or cyber espionage attacks
(9). For that purpose, the capabilities of the existing cyber units have been strengthened and
threat actors like Gamaredon are actively involved in organizing and conducting
cyberattacks.
EclecticIQ researchers identified three different cases, which analysts assess are probably
attributed to Gamaredon group. In these cases, social engineering was being used to send
phishing emails that contains specially crafted messages with malicious attachments. Even if
this remains the main vector of cyberattacks, analysts observed an increase in evasion
techniques used in these three new cases, which could indicate that means the threat actor
spends more time avoiding detection and staying under the radar.
The latest military supports from western NATO allies to the Ukrainian army, like the
confirmation of the sending Patriot missile system and calls from Latvia on Germany to send
Leopard tanks to Ukraine (1), highly likely have increased the will to carry out the
cyberattacks done by Russian state-sponsored APT group Gamaredon. Although there is no
clear proof that western support prompted cyberattacks, a spokesperson for Latvia’s Ministry
of Defense confirmed that the latest attack was “most likely” linked to Gamaredon, although
the investigation is still ongoing (7).
The majority of Gamaredon’s domains continue to be registered under the DNS of the
Russian company called reg[.]ru and to date no action has been taken to block this malicious
infrastructure. Chances about even that Gamaredon group choose this infrastructure on
Russian soil to avoid being defaced by law enforcement or disruption of their offensive
operations by VPS service provider.
Infrastructure outside of Russia is probably used to avoid geo-blocking during cyber-attacks
against western countries and it has relied primarily on VPS providers located within one of 3
autonomous systems (AS), AS14061 (DigitalOcean, LLC), AS 207713 (Global Internet

14/17

Solutions LLC) and AS 39798 (MivoCloud SRL).
EclecticIQ researchers believe that, probably because of the increasing geo-political tension,
these kinds of persistent cyberattacks against Ukraine and its allies will continue by evolving
to become much more evasive than previous attacks.

Protections and Mitigations
Phishing emails that contain HTML Smuggling files in the attachment are on the rise. To
prevent these emails, organizations need to use email gateway security solutions capable of
preventing receiving these kinds of Phishing emails.
Threat Actors are using Living Off the Land Binaries to camouflage their malicious
activity and increase the evasiveness against anti malware. Analysts suggest
implementing SIEM (Security information and event management) solutions on the
network to detect these kinds of executions and using application whitelisting like
Microsoft’s AppLocker to avoid the executions of LOLBINs like MSHTA.exe.
Phishing awareness training must be given to coworkers to improve resilience against
social engineering.
Always deploy the highest level of protection on your firewall and endpoints. In
particular:
- Ensure the firewall has TLS 1.3 inspection, next-gen IPS, and streaming DPI with
machine learning and sandboxing for protection from the latest threats.
- Ensure endpoints have modern next-gen protection capabilities to guard against
downloading malicious files from untrusted sources.
