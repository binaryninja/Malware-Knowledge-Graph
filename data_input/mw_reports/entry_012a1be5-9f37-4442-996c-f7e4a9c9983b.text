Threat Spotlight SecureX Threats
Cisco Talos has identified a new threat actor, which we are naming “YoroTrooper,” that
has been running several successful espionage campaigns since at least June 2022.
YoroTrooper’s main targets are government or energy organizations in Azerbaijan,
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), based
on our analysis. We also observed YoroTrooper compromise accounts from at least
two international organizations: a critical European Union (EU) health care agency
and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Successful compromises
also included Embassies of European countries including Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan. We assess the actor also likely targets other organizations across
Europe and Turkish (Türkiye) government agencies.

Information stolen from successful compromises include credentials from multiple
applications, browser histories & cookies, system information and screenshots.
YoroTrooper’s main tools include Python-based, custom-built and open-source
information stealers, such as the Stink stealer wrapped into executables via the Nuitka
framework and PyInstaller. For remote access, YoroTrooper has also deployed
commodity malware, such as AveMaria/Warzone RAT, LodaRAT and Meterpreter.
The infection chain consists of malicious shortcut files (LNKs) and optional decoy
documents wrapped in malicious archives delivered to targets. The actor appears
intent on exfiltrating documents and other information, likely for use in future
operations.

Introducing YoroTrooper
This new threat actor we are naming “YoroTrooper” has been targeting governments across
Eastern Europe since at least June 2022, and Cisco Talos has found three different activity
clusters with overlapping infrastructure that are all linked to the same threat actor. Cisco
Talos does not have a full overview of this threat actor, as we were able to collect varying
amounts of detail in each campaign. In some cases, for instance, we were able to fully
profile a campaign, while in other cases, we only identified the infrastructure or
compromised data.

Our assessment is that the operators of this threat actor are Russian language speakers,
but not necessarily living in Russia or Russian nationals since their victimology consists
mostly of countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). There are also
snippets of Cyrillic in some of their implants, indicating that the actor is familiar with the
language. Also, in some cases, the attackers are targeting Russian language endpoints
(with Code Page 866), indicating a targeting of individuals speaking that specific language.

Espionage is the main motivation for this threat actor, according to the tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs) we have analyzed. To trick their victims, the threat actor either
registers malicious domains and then generates subdomains or registers typo-squatted
domains similar to legitimate domains from CIS entities to host malicious artifacts. The table
below contains some of the domains created by this actor.

The initial attack vectors are phishing emails with a file attached, which usually consists of
an archive consisting of two files: a shortcut file and a decoy PDF file. The shortcut file is
the initial trigger for the infection, while the PDF is the lure to make the infection look
legitimate. The full details of the campaigns are detailed in the section below.

Phishing email example.

Regarding YoroTrooper’s toolset, the actor uses several commodity remote access trojans
(RAT) and credential stealers. For RATs, we have seen the usage of AveMaria/Warzone
RAT, LodaRAT, and a custom-built implant based on Python. Credential stealers used by
YoroTrooper are either custom scripts, which in some cases are based on the open-sourced
Lazagne project or commodity stealers such as the Stink Stealer. All the Python-based
malware used in the campaign is wrapped up into an executable using frameworks such as
Nuitka or PyInstaller. The custom implants (stealers and RATs) use Telegram bots to
exfiltrate information or receive commands from the operator.

Successful infections and breaches by YoroTrooper
Our analysis has shown that YoroTrooper successfully obtained access to credentials of at
least one account from a critical EU health care agency’s internet-exposed system and
another from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). However, it is unclear if
the threat actors targeted these institutions specifically via such phishing domains or if the
credentials were compromised because they belong to users from a specific list of targeted
countries in Europe. We found malicious domains masquerading as those of legitimate
European Union government agencies, such as “maileecommission[.]inro[.]link”, which
indicates that other European institutions were targeted.
YoroTrooper also successfully compromised embassies belonging to Turkmenistan and
Azerbaijan, where the operators attempted to exfiltrate documents of interest and deploy
additional malware.

4/17

Typically, YoroTrooper employs information stealers and RATs. An analysis of their stolen
data reveals a treasure trove of information stolen from infected endpoints, such as
credentials, histories and cookies for multiple browsers. Information such as credentials is
highly valuable as they may be used either during lateral movement efforts or during
subsequent YoroTrooper campaigns. Browsing histories can be used by a threat actor to
specifically target victims with phishing lures based on their browsing habits.

YoroTrooper affiliation assessment
While attribution can be difficult, we assess that there are no relevant overlaps between
YoroTrooper and Kasablanka, the group behind the development of LodaRat4Android. Our
analysis on Kasablanka in 2021 was that the operators might be different from the
developers, which we can now confirm.
The overlaps with the PoetRAT team are stronger, especially on non-technical aspects of
the campaigns but there are not enough for us to link them even with a low confidence
level. Cisco Talos discovered the PoetRAT team in 2020 during a series of campaigns that
successfully compromised Azerbaijan embassies and other government agencies.

PoetRAT team and YoroTropper share victimology and TTPs
While there are no concrete links between operators of PoetRAT and YoroTrooper, such as
infrastructure overlaps, there are some similarities in their TTPs and victimology. Both
actors use open-source tools to perform credential exfiltration and initial reconnaissance. In
terms of bespoke tools, both threat actors have an affinity towards using Python-based
implants, usually distributed, implemented or packed in a rather unusual way that is
characteristic of the respective threat actors. The PoetRAT team would append the Python
interpreter to a malicious document that would be extracted and used to execute the
Python-based PoetRAT. YoroTropper used the Nuitka framework to pack their custom
credential stealer in such a weird way that it ended up leaking the Python code rather than
obfuscating it.
Regarding victimology, there are some noteworthy overlaps between YoroTrooper and the
PoetRAT team, who mainly target Azerbaijan, specifically their embassies, energy sector
and government institutions. YoroTropper is also targeting Azerbaijan and other CIS
countries, and their embassies, with a similar focus on the energy sector.

Kasablanka is not the sole operator of LodaRAT
While attributing this campaign to a specific threat actor, what stuck out the most was the
use of LodaRAT and its repeated attribution to a singular threat actor called “Kasablanka” in
open-source reporting. While Talos assesses that LodaRAT is built and sometimes operated

5/17

by Kasablanka, there is evidence that indicates that LodaRAT is being used in multiple
distinct campaigns. Therefore, despite the fact that LodaRAT isn’t publicly available, either
open-sourced or for sale publicly — although one can be decompiled easily for use by any
actor — our assessment is that there are multiple operators in the threat landscape
employing LodaRAT. Therefore, YoroTrooper’s use of LodaRAT should not be used as the
sole indicator for attribution.
Our research shows that the LodaRAT samples used by YoroTrooper deviate from previous
versions of the malware employed by Kasablanka. In fact, the LodaRAT variants used by
Yoro Trooper are based on versions we’ve seen being deployed in other crimeware
campaigns alongside RedLine and VenomRAT, indicating LodaRAT’s availability to multiple
threat actors.
This strengthens our assertion that although Kasablanka is the developer of LodaRAT and
Loda4Android, it is not the sole operator of LodaRAT, an assessment we made as early as
2021.

Campaign profiles
This threat actor extensively targets CIS countries using a variety of malware deployed by a
relatively simple infection chain. The operators have utilized a diverse suite of malware
such as:
Commodity RATs and stealers: Warzone, LodaRAT and Stink stealer.
Custom Python-based information stealers: Custom scripts for stealing Google
Chrome browser credentials.
Custom Python-based RATs (with exfiltrators): First seen in June 2022, but gained
popularity with the threat actor around February 2023.
Reverse shells: Python and Meterpreter-based reverse shells.
The following is a timeline of the various geographies targeted by attacks in the campaign
operated by YoroTrooper.

Campaigns infection chain
The latest infection chain from January 2023 is relatively straightforward but consists of
multiple components such as archives, LNKs, HTAs and ultimately the final payloads:

9/17

The infection chains begin with a malicious archive (RARs or ZIPs) delivered to targets with
lure document titles referring to topics of interest to CIS nations, such as:
National_Development_Strategy.rar
Presidents_Strategy_2023.rar
The campaign has also employed some generic file names as well such as “Nota.rar”,
“вложение.rar”.
We have also observed the occasional inclusion of decoy documents in the archive files, as
well.
The malicious LNK files are simple downloaders that employ mshta.exe to download and
execute a remote HTA file on the infected endpoint.

LNK files downloading and executing remote HTA files.
The malicious HTA files employed in this campaign have seen a steady evolution with the
latest variant downloading the next-stage payload: a malicious EXE-based dropper and a
decoy document. All these tasks are accomplished by running PowerShell-based
commands.

10/17

Malicious HTA.

Custom-built final payloads
YoroTrooper has been consistently introducing new malware into their infection chains in
this campaign, including both custom-built and commodity malware. It is worth noting that
while this campaign began with the distribution of commodity malware such as AveMaria
and LodaRAT, it has evolved significantly to include Python-based malware. This highlights
an increase in the efforts the threat actor is putting in, likely derived from successful
breaches during the course of the campaign.

Custom Python RAT
The custom-built Python-based RAT is relatively simple. It uses Telegram as a medium of
C2 communication and exfiltration and contains functionality to:
Run arbitrary commands on the infected endpoint.
Upload files of interest to the attacker to a telegram channel via a bot.
This bot was wrapped up into a .exe either using PyInstaller or Nuitka and then deployed in
the field. There are some interesting observations here suggesting that the adversary may
be speak Russian:
The presence of telegram messages in Russian such as: “Сохраняю в {save_dir}” or
“Файл загружен!\nИмя”.

Snippet: Python based RAT used by YoroTrooper.

Customized stealer script
Another Python-based payload distributed in January 2023 consists of a simple stealer
script that will extract login data for the Chrome browser and exfiltrate it via a Telegram bot.
This custom script has likely been stitched together from publicly available sources, such as
Lazagne:

12/17

Commodity and miscellaneous malware
YoroTrooper has relied heavily on the use of primarily two commodity malware families,
AveMaria/Warzone RAT and LodaRAT, especially in October and November 2022.
AveMaria is a highly prolific malware family available for sale online, while LodaRAT is a
RAT-based family whose authorshiphas been attributed to the Kasablanka threat actor.

Stink stealer analysis
Yet another one of the final payloads found being deployed by YoroTrooper is an opensource credential stealer called “Stink,” which is wrapped into an executable file using the
Nuitka Python compiler framework.
13/17

Stink has several modules from Chromium-based browsers that collect credentials, cookies
and bookmarks, among other information. It harvests Filezilla credentials and authentication
cookies from Discord and Telegram. From the system, the stealer will collect a screenshot,
external IP address, operating system, processor, graphic card and running processes:

All modules are executed in their own process and even each process will use its own
threads to speed up the information collection process. The information is stored in a
temporary directory before being compressed and exfiltrated.
The sender module is responsible for data exfiltration via a Telegram bot. As of early March,
the latest version of Stink Stealer 2.1.1 has an autostart configuration option that will create
a link in the startup folder of the victim profile with the name “Windows Runner.”

Autostart configuration options.

Miscellaneous malware
Apart from commodity malware, we’ve also observed YoroTrooper deploy implants serving
as reverse shells against their targets. For example, in September 2022, we saw a simple
Python-based reverse shell. This one, however, was missing the Cyrillic language check
(CP866).

14/17

Another set of reverse shell implants that YoroTrooper occasionally uses are Meterpreter
binaries that are then used to execute arbitrary commands on the infected endpoint. This
tactic was seen being used by YoroTrooper as late as February 2023.
A C-based custom keylogger also discovered by Talos probably deployed by one of the final
stage payloads consists of the ability to record keystrokes and save them to a file on disk.
