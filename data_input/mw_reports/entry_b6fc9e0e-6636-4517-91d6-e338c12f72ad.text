TRITON Malware Remains Threat to Global Critical
Infrastructure Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
Summary
The FBI is warning that the group responsible for the deployment of TRITON malware against a
Middle East–based petrochemical plant’s safety instrumented system in 2017, the Russian
Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM), continues to
conduct activity targeting the global energy sector. This warning follows the 24 March 2022
unsealing of a US indictment of a Russian national and TsNIIkhM employee involved in that
attack. TRITON was malware designed to cause physical safety systems to cease operating or to
operate in an unsafe manner. Its potential impact could be similar to cyberattacks previously
attributed to Russia that caused blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016.
TRITON malware targeted the Schneider Electric Triconex safety instrumented system (SIS),
which is used to initiate safe shutdown procedures in the event of an emergency. TRITON
malware affected Triconex Tricon safety controllers by modifying in-memory firmware to add
additional programming, potentially leading to damage of a facility, system downtime, and
even loss of life should the SIS fail to initiate safe shutdown procedures. Schneider Electric
addressed the vulnerability (with the Tricon model 3008 v10.0-10.4) when version 11.3 of

TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE

the Tricon controller was released in June 2018; however, older versions of the controller
remain in use and are vulnerable to a similar attack. As a result, the FBI is alerting the ICS
community of continued activity by this group and requests that any indicators of potential
compromise be reported to the FBI.

Threat
In June and again in August 2017, TRITON malware (also known as TRISIS and HatMan) was
used against a Middle East–based petrochemical facility’s safety controllers. The US
Government has publicly attributed TRITON malware to TsNIIKhM, a Russian governmentcontrolled research institution that supports the Russian armed forces with advanced research,
weapons, and cyber capabilities.
TRITON malware was designed to target a specific SIS controller model, with a specific firmware
version, running a small range of specific versioned firmware, and used in critical infrastructure
facilities to initiate immediate shutdown procedures in the event of an emergency. For more
information on affected equipment and TRITON malware, see CISA ICS Advisory Schneider
Electric Triconex Tricon (Update B) and CISA Malware Analysis Report (MAR) HatMan - Safety
System Targeted Malware (Update B).
In the 2017 attack, the actor gained initial access and then moved laterally through the
information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) networks onto the safety system
and installed TRITON malware. This provided the actor access to and control of Schneider
Electric’s Triconex devices used in the facility’s ICS safety system. The facility automatically
entered a safe state after several of the Triconex ICS safety controllers detected an anomaly,
caused by software bugs in the TRITON malware. The subsequent investigation of the shutdown
revealed the attacker’s presence and the malware itself. The facility’s automatic shutdown and
detection of malware prevented the cyberattack from reaching its full capabilities.
TRITON malware’s design gave the attackers complete remote control of the SIS, providing
them the capability to cause significant physical damage and loss of life if the plant were to
enter an unsafe state, according to investigations and analysis that followed the event. After
the August 2017 cyberattack, the actors again obtained unauthorized access to a file server to
collect information on how the facility responded to the incident.
The TRITON attack represented a notable shift in ICS targeting as the first attack designed to
allow physical damage, environmental impact, and loss of life in the event of a plant’s running
in an unsafe condition. Critical infrastructure asset owners and operators should be mindful of
the risks posed to SIS regardless of vendor, as these safety systems will likely continue to be
targeted by sophisticated cyber actors.
Russian cyber actors have previously conspired to deploy malware and take other disruptive
actions for the strategic benefit of Russia through unauthorized access to victim computers and
ICS. These cyberattacks used some of the world’s most destructive malware to date, including

TLP:WHITE

KillDisk and Industroyer, which each caused blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016,
respectively. Russian cyber actors have also deployed non-disruptive malware, such as Havex,
which enables the actors to return to compromised and otherwise vulnerable ICS devices for
future espionage purposes.

Cyber Actors Exploiting Internet-connected ICS/SCADA Systems, PIN 20180614-001.

Recommendations
The FBI encourages potentially affected critical infrastructure asset owners and operators to
maintain business continuity plans to minimize essential service interruptions, as well as
preemptively evaluate potential continuity and capability gaps. Asset owners and operators
should regularly assess and monitor their SIS systems, personnel with access to these systems,
and practice contingency plans.
Furthermore, the FBI encourages those potentially affected to review Schneider Electric’s
guidance set forth in its Security Notification for the EcoStruxure Triconex Tricon, revision 3.
Through the enhanced Tricon CX controller, version 11.4 and later versions, Schneider Electric
has enhanced security and mitigated the risk of the TRITON malware’s attack vector, reducing
further the risks of these type of malware incidents; however, network defenders should
remain vigilant.
Based on the attack framework and malware used in the original TRITON incident, a similar
attack could be designed against other SIS. Therefore, the following recommendations are
relevant to many SIS vendors and brands, along with their customers. The best practices listed
below are applicable to most SIS products used in critical infrastructure facilities today.

SIS Best Practices


Use a unidirectional gateway for applications that need to receive data the SIS provides.



Implement change management procedures for safety controller run-state key positions
and regularly audit physical keys.



Ensure the cybersecurity features in SIS products are always enabled by following the
manufacturers’ security recommendations.

TLP:WHITE



Safety systems should always be deployed on isolated networks.



Physical controls should be in place so that no unauthorized person would have access
to the safety controllers, peripheral safety equipment, or the safety network.



All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left accessible to
unauthorized personnel.



All engineering workstations should be secured and never be connected to any network
other than the safety network.



All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated safety network such as CDs, USB,
drives, DVDs, etc. should be scanned before use in the SIS engineering workstations or
any node connected to this network.



Operator stations should be configured to display an alarm whenever the SIS safety
controller key switch is in the “PROGRAM” mode.



Check network appliances, webservers, and third party vendor logs for early stage
reconnaissance activity against: job postings, pages listing employee social media
accounts, websites for facility subdomains, employee email addresses, pages listing
third party vendors, and equipment specific to identified facilities.
