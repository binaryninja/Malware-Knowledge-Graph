Ransomware – the threat that breaches a victim network, steals data, encrypts local systems
and published the stolen data

Ransomware
What was once a threat to every internet user due to the wide-spread nature of campaigns –
infect as many devices as possible, extort for a small ransom – has turned into a multi-million
dollar payment game. Ransomware operators are now playing in the big league. Ransom
demands in the $50M range have now been seen several times, payments in the tens of
millions are not unheard of.
For the past year I have been monitoring ransomware and data leak sites. What initially
started as a website refresh several times a day has turned into a fully automated system
that tracks 20+ leak sites, browses all listing pages, extracts victim name, publication date
and some other details, parses the output, compares it to the last run and notifies
subscribers of the newly listed victim.
An interesting output of this project is the fact that the sites are monitored 24 hours a day, 7
days a week. This allows me gain to interesting insight when ransomware operators are
working by publishing victim data. Yes, I believe some data leak systems are automated and
no human is pushing a button, but for some leak sites you can identify patterns of working
hours.
For the below analysis I reviewed the data between December 2020 and April 2021 from
leak sites with more than 35 new victims listed. the following nine ransomware and leak sites
made it into the analysis:

Table: Ransomware and data leak site victims (December 2020 to April, 2021)
The first interesting observation that stands out, is that PYSA has four slots, in which they
publish their victims. The vast number of victims are listed in the hour starting at 00:00 UTC
and 11:00 UTC. Only a handful of victims are added after 06:00 UTC and after 15:00 UTC. I
can say with high confidence that this is likely the result of automation on their end. This is
also supported by the observation that PYSA leaks many victims at the same time, in one
go.
Almost the opposite can be seen by looking at the publication times of Conti. The operators
behind this leak site spread publication across the full day, with increased publications in the
hours of 08:00 UTC, 09:00 UTC and 22:00 UTC.
For some other leak sites you can see some down-time, off-work hours. In my opinion, CL0P
is a great example of this behaviour. No new victims were listed between 01:00 and 10:00
UTC, the night time in Europe and neighbouring countries.
Enough pre-text, here is the output table:

Table showing publication hours of data leak sites (initial victim posting hour only)
The list above contains publications on any given day of a week. If you want to look at the
data only for working days, see the screenshot below:

And for publications only on a weekend, this is it. You can see that three groups (CL0P,
DoppelPaymer and PYSA) do not publish victims on a weekend, as they are missing in the
table.

What are your take-aways? Agreeing or disagreeing with my assessment? Do see a different
pattern that you want to discuss? Let me know, I am very interested in seeing your views on
this.
