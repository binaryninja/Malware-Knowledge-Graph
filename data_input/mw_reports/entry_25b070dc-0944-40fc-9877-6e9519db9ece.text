How A Device to Cloud Architecture Defends Against the
SolarWinds Supply Chain Compromise

December 21, 2020

In a blog post released 13 Dec 2020, FireEye disclosed that threat actors compromised
SolarWinds’s Orion IT monitoring and management software with a trojanized version
of SoalrWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll delivered as part of a digitally-signed Windows
Installer Patch. The trojanized file delivers a backdoor, dubbed SUNBURST by FireEye (and
Solorigate by Microsoft), that communicates to third-party servers for command and control
and malicious file transfer giving the attacker a foothold on the affected system with elevated
privileges. From there, additional actions on the objective, such as lateral movement and
data exfiltration, are possible. Since release of the initial blog from FireEye, subsequent
additional analysis by McAfee and the industry as well as alerts by CISA, we have seen the
attack grow in size, breadth and complexity. We will continue to update defensive
recommendation blogs like this as new details emerge.
The use of a compromised software supply chain as an Initial Access technique (T1195.002)
is particularly dangerous as the attack uses assumed trusted paths and as such can go
undetected for a long period. This attack leveraged several techniques, such as trusted
software, signed code and stealthy hiding-in-plain-sight communication, allowing the attacker
to evade even strong defenses and enjoy a long dwell before detection. The sophisticated

1/18

nature of the attack suggests that an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Group is likely
responsible. In fact, FireEye is tracking the group as UNC2452 and has released
countermeasures to identify the initial SUNBURST backdoor. McAfee has also provided an
intelligence summary within MVISION Insights and mitigation controls for the initial entry
vectors are published in KB93861. For additional response actions, please view Part One of
this blog series here. If you are using SolarWinds software, please refer to the company
guidance here to check for vulnerable versions and patch information.
However, looking beyond the initial entry and containment actions, you should think about
how you are prepared for this type of attack in the future. This is a sophisticated actor(s) who
may use other techniques such as Spearphishing to gain access, then move around the
corporate network and potentially steal intellectual property as was the case with FireEye.
They will change techniques and tools, so you need to be ready. Our Advanced Threat
Research team tracks over 700 APT and Cyber Crime campaigns so the potential for
another threat actor to launch a similar attack is high. In this blog, we will take a specific look
at the techniques used in the SolarWinds compromise and provide some guidance on how
McAfee solutions could help you respond now and prepare for this type of threat in the future
with an adaptable security capability for resilience.

Attack Chain Overview
In our first blog in this series, we provided some initial response guidance designed to disrupt
the attack early in the Execution phase or look retrospectively on the endpoints or proxy logs
for indicators of compromise. But as you can see in the attack timeline below, it started much
earlier with purposeful and detailed preparation and includes multiple other steps. A couple
of techniques speak volumes about the sophistication and planning involved in this
campaign.

2/18

Figure 1: SUNBURST Attack Progression
First is the choice of entry vector. The attacker in this case compromised part of the software
supply chain by weaponizing software by SolarWinds, a major brand of IT management
software. While software supply chain compromises are not new, like the recent one affecting
JavaScript, they are typically on a smaller scale or more quickly detected. More common
initial access techniques involve Spearphishing or taking advantage of open remote services
like RDP. While both take planning and effort, weaponizing software from a major technology
company and going undetected in that process is no easy feat. Secondly, the calculated wait
time before external communication and the custom Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)
indicate the attacker has a lot of patience and stealth capability. For more detailed analysis of
these advanced techniques, see McAfee Labs additional analysis blog on the SUNBURST
backdoor.
The attack also involves numerous post-exploitation actions such as command and control
communication masquerading (T1001.003) as normal update traffic, additional payload
transfers (T1105), system discovery, credential harvesting and potentially then movement to
other systems, even cloud-hosted infrastructure systems. The goal of course is to disrupt or
detect any stage of attack before the breakout point and hopefully before any real impact to
the business. The breakout point is when an attacker has gained privileges and starts to
move laterally within the business. At that point, it becomes very difficult but not impossible to
disrupt or detect the activity. But you must act fast. The impact of the attack can vary. In one
case, it could be loss of intellectual property, but in another case, destruction of critical
systems or data could be the goal. Also, what if the attacker used other initial access
techniques, such as Spearphishing (T1566), to deliver a similar backdoor? Would you be
able to detect that activity or any of the follow actions? Our point is don’t just update the
3/18

endpoint with the latest DAT and consider yourself secure. Look for other ways to disrupt or
detect an attack throughout the whole attack chain, leveraging both prevention and detection
capability and keeping the end goal in mind to reduce impact to the business. Also think
about how you prepare. The attackers in this case spent a lot of time in preparation creating
custom malware and infrastructure. How about your organization? Do you know what
attackers might be targeting your organization? Do you know their tactics and techniques?

Staying Ahead with MVISION Insights
In the first hours of a new threat campaign, if the CIO or CISO asked you, “are we exposed
to SUNBURST”, how long would it take you to answer that question? One place to turn is
MVISION Insights. MVISION Insights combines McAfee’s Threat Intelligence research with
telemetry from your endpoint controls to reduce your attack surface against emerging
threats. MVISION Insights tracks over 700 APT and Cyber Crime campaigns as researched
by McAfee’s ATR team, including the most recent, FireEye Red Team tool release and
SolarWinds Supply Chain Compromise campaigns.

Figure 2: Getting details on the attack
In the beginning hours of a new threat response, you can use MVISION Insights to get a
quick summary of the threat, view external resources, and a list of known indicators such as
files, URLs, or IP addresses. The campaign summary saves you from some of the timeconsuming task of combing multiple sites, downloading reports, and building out the broader
picture. MVISION Insights provides critical pieces in one place allowing you to move quicker
through the response process. The next question to answer, is this new attack a risk to my
business? Insights can help you answer that question as well when you click on “Your
Environment”.

4/18

Figure 3: Quick review of your exposure
Insights automatically correlates the indicators of compromise with Threat Events from
McAfee ENS, allowing you to quickly asses if there is an immediate problem now. If you had
a detection, you should immediately go to incident response. Insights reviews your endpoint
control configuration to asses if you have the right content update deployed to potentially
disrupt the threat. At this point, you are closer to answer the CIO question of “are we
exposed”. I say closer because Insights provides only the endpoint protection view currently
so you will need to review other controls you have in place to fully assess risk.

Figure 4: Detail review of your exposure

5/18

However, Insights also assesses your endpoint security posture against other advanced
threat techniques, looking to see if you are getting the best value from ENS by leveraging
signature, intelligence and behavior anomaly detection capability in the solution. This is
important because the attackers will change tactics, using new entry techniques and tools,
so your security posture must continuously adapt. And this is just one campaign. Insights is
summarizing intelligence, surfacing detections and reducing your attack surface
continuously, against 700 campaigns!

Review your Defensive Architecture
Mitigating risk from SUNBURST and similar sophisticated APT campaigns requires a
security architecture that provides defense in depth and visibility throughout the entire attack
chain. You should review your architecture and assess gaps either in technique visibility or
protection capability. Below we have outlined where McAfee and partner solutions could be
used to either disrupt or detect some of the attack techniques used in SUNBURST based on
what we know today.

Figure 5: Device to Cloud Security Architecture
While the attacker is no doubt sophisticated and stealthy, the multi-stage aspect of the attack
presents opportunities to detect or stop at multiple points and perhaps even before the attack
gains a foothold. We cover more about how to use McAfee EDR to search for or detect some
of the techniques used in SUNBURST in next section. However, there are some other key
cyber defense capabilities that may be overlooked in your organizations but are critical to
having a chance at detection and mitigation. We highlight those in this section below.

Getting inside the attacker’s preparation
6/18

Normally this is beyond what most organizations have time to do. However, in this case, you
need to gain any advantage. We discussed MVISION Insights above so here we will cover
additional guidance. During the preparation phase of this attack, the attacker obtains
infrastructure within the target geo to host their command and control server. During this
phase, they also set the hostnames of their C2 servers to mimic target organization
hostnames. A scan for your domain names on external IP blocks can reveal the attack
formation. Open source tools such as Spiderfoot offer a number of plugins to gather and
analyze such types of data. Passive DNS with combination of hosts communicating with
unusual domain names also represent a window of detection whereby Advanced DNS
Protection solutions such as from our SIA partner Infoblox can detect behavior-based DGA
usage by malware and automatically block such DNS resolution requests.

Visibility on DNS
DNS queries often provide the first layers of insights into any type of C2 communication and
data exfiltration. You should enable logging ideally at an upstream resolver(s) where you can
see traffic from your entire infrastructure. More information can be found here for Windows
DNS Servers and Linux Bind DNS Servers. This could be forwarded to McAfee ESM/other
SIEMs for analysis and correlation for detection of DGA-type activities.

NetFlow Logging
Being able to detect unusual flows should also be a priority for incident responders. Along
with DNS queries, NetFlow data when combined with UBA provides a great source of
detection, as the attackers’ use of VPS providers can be combined with user login data to
detect an “impossible rate of travel event.”

Hunting for Indicators with MVISION EDR
As described in the defensive architecture, MVISION EDR plays a vital role in hunting for
prevalence of indicators related to the SUNBURST backdoor and ensuing post compromise
activity. The role of MVISION EDR becomes even more important due to the usage of
manual OPSEC by the threat actor where what follows the initial breach is driven by how the
threat actor is targeting the organisation.

Hunting for Presence of Malicious Files
You can use MVISION EDR or MAR to search endpoints for SUNBURST indicators as
provided by Microsoft and FireEye. If you are licensed for MVISION Insights, you can pivot
directly to MVISION EDR to search for indicators. MVISION EDR supports real-time
searches to hunt for presence of files on the endpoints and allows for sweeps across the
estate. The following query can be used with the pre-populated malicious file hash list. The

7/18

presence of the file on the system is itself does not mean it was successful and further
hunting to check for execution of the actual malicious code on the system.is needed. See the
search syntax below.

Figure 6: Real Time Search for indicators
Additionally, you can do a historical search creation and deletion of files going back up to 90
days in cloud storage.

Figure 7: Historical Search and Modification of Files
The threat actor is known to rename system utilities/files and clean up their tracks. MVISION
EDR can review historical changes to the file system, this is crucial in determining if an
endpoint was a victim of this attack. The flexible search interface can be used to filter down
and track the progress of the completion of the attacker’s objectives for e.g. look at changes
triggered from the infected dll’s such as netsetupsvc.dll.

Hunting for Malicious Network Connections
MVISION EDR allows for tracing of active network connections leveraging the real time
search functionalities

Figure 8: Realtime Network Connections

9/18

You can also leverage the historical search function to look for historical connections related
to the command and control activity for this threat actor. The filtering by process ID and
source/destination IP allows analysts to track down the malicious communications.

Figure 9: Historical Network Connections
MVISION EDR also allows analysts to review historical DNS lookups thus allowing for the
ability to hunt for malicious DNS lookups. This is a very important capability in the product as
many organizations do not log DNS or have a DNS hierarchy that makes it harder to log the
end device making the actual request.

Hunting for Malicious Named Pipes Across the Estate
MVISION EDR includes custom collector creation ability that allows for execution of custom
commands across the estate. In this case, it’s possible to look for the existence of the
Named Pipes by executing the following Powershell command:

Figure 11: EDR Named Pipe Collector
Powershell Command for Pipe detection [System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles(“\\.\\pipe\\”) | %{($_ split “\\”)[6]}

HostInfo hostname, ip_address, os where _NamedPipe pipename contains “583da945-62af10e8-4902-a8f2 05c72b2e”

Hunting for Malicious Processes
It is known the attacker in its final stages leverages legitimate SolarWinds processes to
complete their objectives:
\Windows\SysWOW64\WerFault.exe

11/18

\SolarWinds\Orion\ExportToPDFCmd.Exe
\SolarWinds\Orion\APM\APMServiceControl.exe
\SolarWinds.Credentials\SolarWinds.Credentials.Orion.WebApi.exe
\SolarWinds\Orion\Topology\SolarWinds.Orion.Topology.Calculator.exe
\SolarWinds\Orion\Database-Maint.exe

ProcessHistory parentname, name, id, cmdline WHERE ProcessHistory parentname equals
“WerFault.exe” or ProcessHistory parentname equals “ExportToPDFCmd.Exe” or
ProcessHistory parentname equals “APMServiceControl.exe” or ProcessHistory parentname
equals “SolarWinds.Credentials.Orion.WebApi.exe” or ProcessHistory parentname equals
“SolarWinds.Orion.Topology.Calculator.exe” or ProcessHistory parentname equals
“\SolarWinds\Orion\Database-Maint.exe”

Hunting back longer than 90 days with EDR Trace Data
MVISION EDR’s architecture leverages the Data Exchange Layer to stream trace data to our
cloud service where we apply analytics to identify or investigate a threat. Trace data are
artifacts from the endpoint, such as file hashes, processes, communications, typically
needed for endpoint detection and searches. The DXL architecture allows that data to be
streamed to the cloud as well to a local data store such as a SIEM or other log storage like
Elastic simultaneously.

12/18

Figure 14: Long term search of EDR trace data in a Kibana dashboard

Figure 15: Long term search of EDR trace data in a Sp dashboard
You can store the data longer than the 90-day maximum McAfee stores in our cloud. Why is
this important? Recent analysis of SUNBURST suggests that the attack goes as far back as
March 2020, and perhaps earlier. This local storage would provide capability to hunt for
indicators further back as needed, if so configured.

Assessing Visibility
How do you know what data sources are needed to detect Mitre Att&ck tactics and
techniques? Carlos Diaz from MVISION EDR engineering wrote a great tool called MitreAssistant to simplify that process. You can download that tool here.

Detecting Actions on Objective
Post Initial Exploit Threat Detection and Analysis in EDR
One of the key challenges threat hunters and security analysts face is where the attack
progresses through to the second phase of the attack, where it is understood the attacker
has dropped malware to execute and complete their objectives. This usage of sophisticated
execution of malware from a trusted process is detected by MVISION EDR and automatically
mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. As part of the detection and process tracing,
EDR also captures the command executed on the endpoint. This becomes invaluable in
case of tracking the manual OPSEC aspect of the second phase of the attack.

Figure 16: Mitre analysis and threat detection for post exploit execution
MVISION EDR provides extensive capabilities to respond to threats once they have been
assessed, e.g. real-time searches once executed allows analysts to scope the affected
endpoints rapidly at which point the solution offers multiple options as a method for
containment and remediation of the threat across the estate through bulk operations.

Figure 17: EDR Bulk Threat Mitigation

Detecting Data Exfiltration, Lateral Movement and Prevention
MVISION EDR provides a way to easily visualize data egress by looking at topology view of
the endpoints where malicious activity has been detected, by observing the network-flow
map the outlier connections can be easily identified and then correlated with WHOIS, IP
reputation and Passive DNS data from providers like McAfee GTI and Virustotal. Once
established, the external connections can be blocked and the endpoint can be quarantined
from the EDR console. EDR also shows common processes spawning across multiple
endpoints to showcase lateral movement and is also tagged as part of the MITRE techniques
being identified and detected.

Figure 18: EDR Lateral Movement and Exfiltration
Combining EDR with Deception technology such as that from Attivo Networks brings
together a combination of offensive detection where the attacker can be effectively trapped
as result of not getting hold of the real credentials required to make the lateral movement/
privilege escalation a success thus failing in their objective completion.

15/18

An integrated approach to DLP can also provide effective protection against the completion
of the objectives for e.g. unified DLP policy across the endpoint and web-gateway looking for
exfiltration of sensitive organizational data can also provide valuable defenses. McAfee’s
UCE platform provides such unified data protection capabilities.

Cloud account compromise detection
Our latest research indicates attacker is actively looking to establish additional footholds into
customer cloud environments such as Azure AD or bypass multi-factor authentication by
hijacking SAML sessions, McAfee’s MVISION Cloud Access Control and User Anomaly
Detection can identify suspicious access attempts to cloud services and infrastructure.

16/18

It is recommended to increase monitoring and investigations into such activity especially with
privileged accounts on sensitive infrastructure

Supply Chain and Intellectual Property Protection

17/18

In addition to architecture review and continuous hunting for indicators, it is recommended
that customers work with their suppliers – IT, Cloud Services, Infrastructure, Hardware, etc. –
to validate integrity. Secondly, review controls, detection use cases in the SOC and logs,
specifically related to your intellectual property. A tabletop exercise to rehearse crisis
management and breach notification procedures is also recommended.

Summary and Next Steps
It’s important to note that analysis of this attack is ongoing across the globe and events are
still unfolding. The presence/detection of the backdoor and affected software is just the
beginning for many customers. MVISION EDR or other tool detections of malicious namedpipe presence and domains help indicate to a customer if the backdoor was running, but with
the gathered system information, the adversary may have valid accounts and access to AD
or Cloud systems in some cases. The adversary has been wiping information/log files to
erase traces. Incident Response is a critical piece of your overall business resilience and if
you are affected, you will no doubt be asking yourself these types of questions.
When did we install the vulnerable software?
Did they compromise user-accounts and have AD access?
Did they install additional backdoors?
How many systems and accounts are affected?
Were cloud or enterprise resources accessed?
Was information stolen? If so, do we have notification procedures?
Are there other supply chain compromises yet undiscovered?
McAfee will continue to post analysis results and defensive guidance as we learn more about
the attack. Customers should follow McAfee Labs posts, check the Insights Preview
Dashboard for latest threat intelligence, and continually check the Knowledge Center for
latest product guidance.
