Fake Income Tax Application Targets Indian Taxpayers

September 7, 2021

Indian taxpayers are being targeted explicitly via mobile applications, phishing emails, and smishing,
especially during the pandemic. A variant of a mobile app that impersonates India’s Income Tax
Department (IT) was first identified by the McAfee Threat Intelligence team
in September 2021. These apps conduct phishing activities and collect sensitive information from
their victims. The attacker could later sell this information on cybercrime forums.
During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a Twitter post covering the
application that masquerades as an official Income Tax department app. The app has a similar icon to that
of the IT Department of India and is named iMobile.
Cyble Research Labs downloaded the malware samples and performed a detailed
analysis. We determined that the malware performs phishing activities to steal
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as date of birth, PAN number, Aadhaar number, bank account
details, and debit card details, including expiry date, CVV number, and PIN.

Figure 2: Application Start Flow
We have outlined the flow of the application and the various activities it conducts in Figure 2.
The application has a similar icon as the IT department of India’s official logo.
The application asks the users to allow it as defaults SMS app. Once it becomes the default app, it
can handle SMS data.
The application asks users to input credentials like PAN number and registered mobile number.
The application asks users to input bank account details including debit card information.
The application also asks for Internet Banking credentials.
Upon simulating the application, it requests that users make it their default SMS app, and
then the application proceeds with its malicious activity. Refer to Figure 3.

Figure 4 shows the malware pretending to be the official Income Tax app from India’s Income
Tax department. We can also see that the app is asking for credentials such as PAN number and mobile
number.

Manifest Description
iMobile requests twenty-six different permissions, of which the attackers could abuse seven. In this
case, the malware can:
Collect SMS data.
Read the information of device such as usage history and statistics.
Receive and send SMSs.
We have listed the dangerous permissions below.
Permissions

Description

READ_SMS

Access phone’s messages.

BROADCAST_STICKY

Allow the application to communicate with other apps. These broadcasts
happen without the user’s knowledge.

DISABLE_KEYGUARD

Allows applications to disable the keyguard.

PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS

Provides access to device usage history and statistics.

READ_PHONE_STATE

Allows access to phone state, including the current cellular network
information, the phone number and the serial number of this phone, the
status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any Phone Accounts registered
on the device.

RECEIVE_SMS

Allows an application to receive SMS messages.

SEND_SMS

Allows an application to send SMS messages.

Table 1: Permissions’ Description
Upon reviewing the code of the application, the launcher activity of the malicious app was identified, as
shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Launching Activity
The permissions and services defined in the manifest file that were identified have the ability to replace the
default Messages app. This app will then be able to handle sending and receiving SMSs and MMSs. Refer
to Figure 8.

Figure 9 represents that the malware has defined customized services that
use the BROADCAST_WAP_PUSH service. Through this service, an application can broadcast a
notification that a WAP Push message has been received.

Figure 9 Using Broadcast WAP Push Permission
Threat Actors (TAs) may abuse this service to create could false MMS message receipts or replace the
original content with malicious content. Google has instructed that it is not for use by third-party
applications.
Figure 10 represents that the malware has defined customized services
that leverage the permission SEND_RESPOND_VIA_MESSAGE. This permits the application to send a
request to other messaging apps to handle respond-via-message action during incoming calls.

Figure 10 Using Send Respond VIA Message

Source Code Description
The application uses the permission that is defined in Figure 8 to send SMSs. Upon allowing the
application to replace the default messaging app, it can also read incoming messages. Refer to Figure 11.

Figure 11 Sending SMS
The below code shows one of the multiple deobfuscation method used by the malware, which leverages a
simple cipher substitution. All strings are decoded using distinct classes, with each class having a unique
table value. Refer to Figure 12.

Figure 12 Deobfuscation Method
During our traffic analysis, we observed that the malware is uploading the banking details,
including account numbers and debit card details such as card number, expiry date, CVV, and PIN to
the Command and Control (C2) server hxxp://jsig.quicksytes[.]com/MC/NN180521/mc.php. Refer to
Figure 13.

The below image shows that the malware has hardcoded data, i.e., a mobile
number originating from India.

Conclusion
The Threat Actors behind malicious applications constantly adapt and use various sophisticated techniques
to avoid detection and target users. Such malicious applications
masquerade as legitimate applications to trick users into installing them.
Users should only install applications from the official Google Play Store to secure themselves from
attacks such as these.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store.

9/10

Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Users should be careful of the permissions they are enabling.
If you find this malicious application on your device, uninstall, or delete it immediately.
Use the shared IOCs to monitor and block the malware infection.
Keep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.
Keep your Android device, OS, and applications updated to the latest versions.
Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
