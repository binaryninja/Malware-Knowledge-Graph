Since October 2019, many cases of Emotet infection were reported. JPCERT/CC has
published a security alert and a blog article detailing the detection and security measures, as
well as providing notification and support for affected users.
Europol announced that Emotet infrastructure was disrupted thanks to the joint operation
together with some foreign authorities in January 2021 and information regarding affected

users is to be distributed via the CERT network. In Japan, there are still many infected
devices, and JPCERT/CC has been notifying those affected with the support from local and
international partners.
This article explains the global operation for Emotet disruption and the changes in the
number of infected devices in Japan since then, followed by the notification activity by
JPCERT/CC and guidance on how to respond to the infection.

6. Updates on our notification activities

1. Emotet overview
A device is infected with Emotet when a user opens a malicious Word file and selects
“Enable content”. The malware may perform the following on the infected devices:
Steal credentials stored in the device or browsers
Use the stolen credentials to spread infection in the network via SMB
Steal Email accounts and passwords
Steal Email contents and contact information
Send emails to spread infection using the stolen Email accounts and contents etc.
Infect the device with other kinds of malware

2. Emotet disruption
Emotet’s infrastructure was disrupted on 27 January 2021 as a result of “Operation
LadyBird”, which is a joint effort by the authorities in the Netherlands, Germany, the United
States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine, coordinated by Europol
and Eurojust. The following is the achievement of this operation:
C2 servers connected to Emotet are now under the control of the authorities
Some members operating Emotet have been arrested
Infected devices are now redirected to servers controlled by the authorities
Thanks to this operation, it is safe to say that Emotet is no longer harmful. Nonetheless,
infected devices are still likely at the risk.

3. Emotet infection in Japan

2/9

Following the joint operation, foreign partner organisations started providing JPCERT/CC
with the information about infected hosts in Japan, particularly the details of the devices
connected to the servers that are under the foreign authorities’ control. Figure 1 shows the
number of infected devices in Japan based on the data provided.

Figure 1： Emotet Infected devices in Japan
As of 27 January, when the joint operation took place, there were connections to the
infrastructure from about 900 IP addresses in Japan. Starting on 5 February, we have also
been receiving the computer name of the infected devices. It is assumed that the number of
the unique computer names indicates more accurate number of infected devices, as an IP
address linked to a device may change.
With the disruption of the infrastructure, Emotet’s anti-detection function will no longer work,
and it will be detected and/or removed by antivirus software instead. However, based on the
number of the computer names, it is assumed that there are about 500 infected devices as of
February 2021.

4. Notification to affected users
Based on the information provided by the relevant parties, JPCERT/CC has been notifying
the users of the infected devices in Japan with the support of ISPs and other partners.
On 19 February, Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication, together with the
National Police Agency, ICT-ISAC and ISPs, announced their joint effort on notification
activities to users of infected devices based on the information from foreign authorities. While

3/9

cooperating in this initiative, JPCERT/CC will also continue the aforementioned outreach
activities based on the information from partners.
Thanks to the global operation, Emotet will be uninstalled from the devices at 12:00 on 25
April 2021 (according to the local time of each device). However, security measures still need
to be implemented on the infected devices as the malware may have already performed the
following:
Steal credentials stored in the device or browsers
Steal Email accounts and passwords
Steal Email contents and contact information
Infect the device with other kinds of malware
Users still need to take measures if antivirus software has detected and/or removed Emotet.

5. Response to Emotet infection
“EmoCheck”, developed by JPCERT/CC, can be used to check if a device is infected with
Emotet. Please download the tool from GitHub and copy it to the devices that need checking.
It is recommended to run it with the privilege of the user who normally use the device.

If the message “Emotet was detected” is displayed (as highlighted in red in Figure 2), the
device is infected with Emotet.

in Figure 2)
When the infected devices are identified, please take the following security measures:
Delete Emotet which is stored in the image path according to the EmoCheck result.
Change email account passwords for Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.
Change passwords stored in browsers.
Check if the device is infected with other kinds of malware.
If the device is infected with other kinds of malware, evidence may be left in the following
locations:
Autorun registry
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Task scheduler
If the above settings refer to the suspicious folders as below, the device is possibly infected
with other kinds of malware:
Folders under C:\Users(user name)\AppData\
C:\ProgramData\
More details on how to check and respond to the infection are also available on our past blog
article

6. Updates on our notification activities (Updated on 25/May 2021)
JPCERT/CC has notified affected users cooperating with ISPs and other organizations since
we received the said data in late January until Emotet was automatically deleted in late April.
Through the joint notification effort by the National Police Agency and the Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communication, the information on the affected IP addresses was provided to

5/9

ICT-ISAC in mid-February and received by each ISP in late March. This accounts for about
90 percent of the whole affected IP addresses in Japan, and JPCERT/CC has notified the
rest directly to administrators since late January.
After the global take down operation, Emotet was updated so that it automatically stops itself
at 12:00 on 25 April (local time of each device). The following figure on the number of
Emotet-infected devices in Japan clearly shows that only few infections have been observed
since then.

We appreciate all the supports we received from everyone concerned.

In closing
We would like to take this opportunity to thank the effort by “Operation LadyBird” in disrupting
the Emotet infrastructure.
Besides Emotet, there are many other kinds of malware spreading infection via email and its
attachment. Please pay careful attention when you open attachments. We also recommend
that you regularly scan your devices with the latest antivirus definition file, in addition to
applying the latest security programs for your OS and software.
JPCERT/CC will continue to work closely with both local and international partners.
