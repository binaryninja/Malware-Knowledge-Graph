Summary
This joint cybersecurity advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and
Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for
all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques
This joint cybersecurity advisory—written by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)—provides information on
Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actor activity targeting various
U.S. state, local, territorial, and tribal (SLTT) government networks, as well as aviation
networks. This advisory updates joint CISA-FBI cybersecurity advisory AA20-283A: APT
Actors Chaining Vulnerabilities Against SLTT, Critical Infrastructure, and Elections
Organizations.
Since at least September 2020, a Russian state-sponsored APT actor—known variously as
Berserk Bear, Energetic Bear, TeamSpy, Dragonfly, Havex, Crouching Yeti, and Koala in
open-source reporting—has conducted a campaign against a wide variety of U.S. targets.
The Russian state-sponsored APT actor has targeted dozens of SLTT government and
aviation networks, attempted intrusions at several SLTT organizations, successfully
compromised network infrastructure, and as of October 1, 2020, exfiltrated data from at least
two victim servers.
The Russian-sponsored APT actor is obtaining user and administrator credentials to
establish initial access, enable lateral movement once inside the network, and locate high
value assets in order to exfiltrate data. In at least one compromise, the APT actor laterally
traversed an SLTT victim network and accessed documents related to:
Sensitive network configurations and passwords.
Standard operating procedures (SOP), such as enrolling in multi-factor authentication
(MFA).
IT instructions, such as requesting password resets.
Vendors and purchasing information.
Printing access badges.
To date, the FBI and CISA have no information to indicate this APT actor has intentionally
disrupted any aviation, education, elections, or government operations. However, the actor
may be seeking access to obtain future disruption options, to influence U.S. policies and
actions, or to delegitimize SLTT government entities.
1/9

As this recent malicious activity has been directed at SLTT government networks, there may
be some risk to elections information housed on SLTT government networks. However, the
FBI and CISA have no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been
compromised. Due to the heightened awareness surrounding elections infrastructure and the
targeting of SLTT government networks, the FBI and CISA will continue to monitor this
activity and its proximity to elections infrastructure.

Technical Details
The FBI and CISA have observed Russian state-sponsored APT actor activity targeting U.S.
SLTT government networks, as well as aviation networks. The APT actor is using Turkish IP
addresses 213.74.101[.]65 , 213.74.139[.]196 , and 212.252.30[.]170 to connect
to victim web servers (Exploit Public Facing Application [T1190]).
The actor is using 213.74.101[.]65 and 213.74.139[.]196 to attempt brute force
logins and, in several instances, attempted Structured Query Language (SQL) injections on
victim websites (Brute Force [T1110]; Exploit Public Facing Application [T1190]). The APT
actor also hosted malicious domains, including possible aviation sector target
columbusairports.microsoftonline[.]host , which resolved to 108.177.235[.]92
and [cityname].westus2.cloudapp.azure.com ; these domains are U.S. registered and
are likely SLTT government targets (Drive-By Compromise [T1189]).
The APT actor scanned for vulnerable Citrix and Microsoft Exchange services and identified
vulnerable systems, likely for future exploitation. This actor continues to exploit a Citrix
Directory Traversal Bug (CVE-2019-19781) and a Microsoft Exchange remote code
2/9

execution flaw (CVE-2020-0688).
The APT actor has been observed using Cisco AnyConnect Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
virtual private network (VPN) connections to enable remote logins on at least one victim
network, possibly enabled by an Exim Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) vulnerability
(CVE 2019-10149) (External Remote Services [T1133]). More recently, the APT actor
enumerated and exploited a Fortinet VPN vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379) for Initial Access
[TA0001] and a Windows Netlogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) to obtain access to
Windows Active Directory (AD) servers for Privilege Escalation [TA0004] within the network
(Valid Accounts [T1078]). These vulnerabilities can also be leveraged to compromise other
devices on the network (Lateral Movement [TA0008]) and to maintain Persistence [TA0003]).
Between early February and mid-September, these APT actors used 213.74.101[.]65 ,
212.252.30[.]170 , 5.196.167[.]184 , 37.139.7[.]16 , 149.56.20[.]55 ,
91.227.68[.]97 , and 5.45.119[.]124 to target U.S. SLTT government networks.
Successful authentications—including the compromise of Microsoft Office 365 (O365)
accounts—have been observed on at least one victim network (Valid Accounts [T1078]).

3/9

IP address 51.159.28[.]101 appears to have been configured to receive stolen Windows
New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTLM) credentials. FBI and CISA
recommend organizations take defensive actions to mitigate the risk of leaking NTLM
credentials; specifically, organizations should disable NTLM or restrict outgoing NTLM.
Organizations should consider blocking IP address 51.159.28[.]101 (although this action
alone may not mitigate the threat, as the APT actor has likely established, or will establish,
additional infrastructure points).
Organizations should check available logs for traffic to/from IP address 51.159.28[.]101
for indications of credential-harvesting activity. As the APT actors likely have—or will—
establish additional infrastructure points, organizations should also monitor for Server
Message Block (SMB) or WebDAV activity leaving the network to other IP addresses.
Refer to AA20-296A.stix for a downloadable copy of IOCs.
Network Defense-in-Depth
Proper network defense-in-depth and adherence to information security best practices can
assist in mitigating the threat and reducing the risk to critical infrastructure. The following
guidance may assist organizations in developing network defense procedures.
Keep all applications updated according to vendor recommendations, and especially
prioritize updates for external facing applications and remote access services to
address CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2020-0688, CVE 2019-10149, CVE-2018-13379, and
CVE-2020-1472. Refer to table 1 for patch information on these CVEs.

Microsoft Security Advisory for
CVE-2020-1472

Follow Microsoft’s guidance on monitoring logs for activity related to the Netlogon
vulnerability, CVE-2020-1472.
5/9

If appropriate for your organization’s network, prevent external communication of all
versions of SMB and related protocols at the network boundary by blocking
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports 139 and 445 and User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) port 137. See the CISA publication on SMB Security Best Practices for more
information.
Implement the prevention, detection, and mitigation strategies outlined in:
CISA Alert TA15-314A – Compromised Web Servers and Web Shells – Threat
Awareness and Guidance.
National Security Agency Cybersecurity Information Sheet U/OO/134094-20 –
Detect and Prevent Web Shells Malware.
Isolate external facing services in a network demilitarized zone (DMZ) since they are
more exposed to malicious activity; enable robust logging, and monitor the logs for
signs of compromise.
Establish a training mechanism to inform end users on proper email and web usage,
highlighting current information and analysis and including common indicators of
phishing. End users should have clear instructions on how to report unusual or
suspicious emails.
Implement application controls to only allow execution from specified application
directories. System administrators may implement this through Microsoft Software
Restriction Policy, AppLocker, or similar software. Safe defaults allow applications to
run from PROGRAMFILES , PROGRAMFILES(X86) , and WINDOWS folders. All other
locations should be disallowed unless an exception is granted.
Block Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections originating from untrusted external
addresses unless an exception exists; routinely review exceptions on a regular basis
for validity.
Comprehensive Account Resets
For accounts where NTLM password hashes or Kerberos tickets may have been
compromised (e.g., through CVE-2020-1472), a double-password-reset may be required in
order to prevent continued exploitation of those accounts. For domain-admin-level
credentials, a reset of KRB-TGT “Golden Tickets” may be required, and Microsoft has
released specialized guidance for this. Such a reset should be performed very carefully if
needed.
If there is an observation of CVE-2020-1472 Netlogon activity or other indications of valid
credential abuse, it should be assumed the APT actors have compromised AD administrative
accounts. In such cases, the AD forest should not be fully trusted, and, therefore, a new
forest should be deployed. Existing hosts from the old compromised forest cannot be
migrated in without being rebuilt and rejoined to the new domain, but migration may be done
through “creative destruction,” wherein, as endpoints in the legacy forest are
decommissioned, new ones can be built in the new forest. This will need to be completed in
on-premise—as well as in Azure-hosted—AD instances.

6/9

Note that fully resetting an AD forest is difficult and complex; it is best done with the
assistance of personnel who have successfully completed the task previously.
It is critical to perform a full password reset on all user and computer accounts in the AD
forest. Use the following steps as a guide.
1. Create a temporary administrator account, and use this account only for all
administrative actions
2. Reset the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (krbtgt ) password;[1] this must be
completed before any additional actions (a second reset will take place in step 5)
3. Wait for the krbtgt reset to propagate to all domain controllers (time may vary)
4. Reset all account passwords (passwords should be 15 characters or more and
randomly assigned):
1. User accounts (forced reset with no legacy password reuse)
2. Local accounts on hosts (including local accounts not covered by Local
Administrator Password Solution [LAPS])
3. Service accounts
4. Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) account
5. Domain Controller machine account
6. Application passwords
5. Reset the krbtgt password again
6. Wait for the krbtgt reset to propagate to all domain controllers (time may vary)
7. Reboot domain controllers
8. Reboot all endpoints
The following accounts should be reset:
AD Kerberos Authentication Master (2x)
All Active Directory Accounts
All Active Directory Admin Accounts
All Active Directory Service Accounts
All Active Directory User Accounts
DSRM Account on Domain Controllers
Non-AD Privileged Application Accounts
Non-AD Unprivileged Application Accounts
Non-Windows Privileged Accounts
Non-Windows User Accounts
Windows Computer Accounts
Windows Local Admin
VPN Vulnerabilities
Implement the following recommendations to secure your organization’s VPNs:

7/9

Update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices being used to remote
into work environments with the latest software patches and security configurations.
See CISA Tips Understanding Patches and Software Updates and Securing Network
Infrastructure Devices. Wherever possible, enable automatic updates.
Implement MFA on all VPN connections to increase security. Physical security
tokens are the most secure form of MFA, followed by authenticator app-based MFA.
SMS and email-based MFA should only be used when no other forms are available. If
MFA is not implemented, require teleworkers to use strong passwords. See CISA Tips
Choosing and Protecting Passwords and Supplementing Passwords for more
information.
Discontinue unused VPN servers. Reduce your organization’s attack surface by
discontinuing unused VPN servers, which may act as a point of entry for attackers. To protect
your organization against VPN vulnerabilities:
Audit configuration and patch management programs.
Monitor network traffic for unexpected and unapproved protocols, especially outbound
to the Internet (e.g., Secure Shell [SSH], SMB, RDP).
Implement MFA, especially for privileged accounts.
Use separate administrative accounts on separate administration workstations.
Keep software up to date. Enable automatic updates, if available.
