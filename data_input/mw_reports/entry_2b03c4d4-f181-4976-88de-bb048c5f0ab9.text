1. Security of cyberspace is extremely important to ensure peace and prosperity of the
international community including Japan, and it was reaffirmed at the recent G7
Leaders’ Summit held in the United Kingdom.
2. Against this backdrop, on July 19th (local time), the United Kingdom, the United States
and other countries issued public statements including on a group conducting
cyberattacks known as APT40 which the Chinese government is behind, and an
indictment charging four members of APT40 has been issued in the United States.
Japan also assesses that it is highly likely that the Chinese government is behind
APT40 and has been paying close attention with deep concern to these attacks by
APT40 and others which threaten the security of cyberspace. Japan strongly supports
the public statements by the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries
which express the determination to uphold the rules-based international order in
cyberspace.
3. Japan recently made the announcement on cyberattacks in which it is highly likely that
an Advanced Persistent Threat group called Tick, which the Unit 61419 of the Chinese
People’s Liberation Army is behind, was involved. Japan further confirmed that
Japanese companies were also targeted in the aforementioned case by the group
known as APT40.
4. Malicious cyber activities that could potentially undermine the foundation of democracy
embodied by free, fair and secure cyberspace cannot be condoned. The Government
of Japan considers it to be a matter of strong concern from the national security
viewpoint, firmly condemns and will take strict measures against these activities.
