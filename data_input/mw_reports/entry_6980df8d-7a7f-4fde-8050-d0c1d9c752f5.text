On approximately August 21, 2021, security researchers, cybersecurity leaders, and
eventually the CISA, began voicing concerns about the inevitable threat of LockFile
ransomware attacks on a wide variety of ill-informed and unprepared victims. Threat actors
had been caught targeting on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers via ProxyShell
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have been dubbed, “worse than ProxyLogon”. Patches
for these vulnerabilities were made available in April & May, but many servers were still
vulnerable.
That same day, Morphisec Guard, our Zero Trust, Endpoint Protection Platform, successfully
detected and prevented the execution of Cobaltstrike beacons, which were delivered via a
ProxyShell exploit. Therefore, Morphisec actively protected the exchange servers of our
customers.
Below is an example of one of the prevention events:

Conclusion
Morphisec demonstrates the vital nature of a strong prevention strategy for servers. It is our
hope that more enterprises will move away from faulty detection-centered strategies and
move toward preventative, proactive solutions.
