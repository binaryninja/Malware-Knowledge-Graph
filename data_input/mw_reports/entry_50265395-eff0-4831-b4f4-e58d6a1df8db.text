Understanding and Mitigating Russian StateSponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical
Infrastructure
SUMMARY
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA)—authored by the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Security
Agency (NSA)—is part of our continuing cybersecurity
mission to warn organizations of cyber threats and help the
cybersecurity community reduce the risk presented by these
threats. This CSA provides an overview of Russian statesponsored cyber operations; commonly observed tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs); detection actions;
incident response guidance; and mitigations. This overview is
intended to help the cybersecurity community reduce the risk
presented by these threats.

Actions critical infrastructure
organizations should implement to
immediately strengthen their cyber
posture.
• Patch all systems. Prioritize
patching known exploited
vulnerabilities.
• Implement multi-factor
authentication.
• Use antivirus software.
• Develop internal contact lists
and surge support.

CISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage the cybersecurity
community—especially critical infrastructure network
defenders—to adopt a heightened state of awareness and to conduct proactive threat hunting, as
outlined in the Detection section. Additionally, CISA, the FBI, and NSA strongly urge network
defenders to implement the recommendations listed below and detailed in the Mitigations section.
These mitigations will help organizations improve their functional resilience by reducing the risk of
compromise or severe business degradation.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Note: this advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 10. See
the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
Historically, Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors have used common
but effective tactics—including spearphishing, brute force, and exploiting known vulnerabilities against
accounts and networks with weak security—to gain initial access to target networks. Vulnerabilities
known to be exploited by Russian state-sponsored APT actors for initial access include:
•
•
•
•
•

conjunction with CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065)

Russian state-sponsored APT actors have also demonstrated sophisticated tradecraft and cyber
capabilities by compromising third-party infrastructure, compromising third-party software, or
developing and deploying custom malware. The actors have also demonstrated the ability to maintain
persistent, undetected, long-term access in compromised environments—including cloud
environments—by using legitimate credentials.

Russian state-sponsored APT actors have used sophisticated cyber capabilities to target a variety of
U.S. and international critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Defense Industrial
Base as well as the Healthcare and Public Health, Energy, Telecommunications, and Government
Facilities Sectors. High-profile cyber activity publicly attributed to Russian state-sponsored APT actors
by U.S. government reporting and legal actions includes:
•

•

•

Russian state-sponsored APT actors targeting state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)
governments and aviation networks, September 2020, through at least December 2020.
Russian state-sponsored APT actors targeted dozens of SLTT government and aviation
networks. The actors successfully compromised networks and exfiltrated data from multiple
victims.
Russian state-sponsored APT actors’ global Energy Sector intrusion campaign, 2011 to
2018. These Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a multi-stage intrusion campaign
in which they gained remote access to U.S. and international Energy Sector networks,
deployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related data.
Russian state-sponsored APT actors’ campaign against Ukrainian critical
infrastructure, 2015 and 2016. Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a
cyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution companies, leading to multiple companies
experiencing unplanned power outages in December 2015. The actors deployed BlackEnergy
malware to steal user credentials and used its destructive malware component, KillDisk, to
make infected computers inoperable. In 2016, these actors conducted a cyber-intrusion
campaign against a Ukrainian electrical transmission company and deployed CrashOverride
malware specifically designed to attack power grids.

DETECTION
Given Russian state-sponsored APT actors demonstrated capability to maintain persistent, long-term
access in compromised enterprise and cloud environments, CISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage all
critical infrastructure organizations to:
●

Implement robust log collection and retention. Without a centralized log collection and
monitoring capability, organizations have limited ability to investigate incidents or detect the
threat actor behavior described in this advisory. Depending on the environment, examples
include:
o
o

●

Native tools such as M365’s Sentinel.
Third-party tools, such as Sparrow, Hawk, or CrowdStrike's Azure Reporting Tool
(CRT), to review Microsoft cloud environments and to detect unusual activity, service
principals, and application activity. Note: for guidance on using these and other
detection tools, refer to CISA Alert Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in
Microsoft Cloud Environments.

Look for behavioral evidence or network and host-based artifacts from known Russian
state-sponsored TTPs. See table 1 for commonly observed TTPs.
o
o

To detect password spray activity, review authentication logs for system and
application login failures of valid accounts. Look for multiple, failed authentication
attempts across multiple accounts.
To detect use of compromised credentials in combination with a VPS, follow the below
steps:









Look for suspicious “impossible logins,” such as logins with changing
username, user agent strings, and IP address combinations or logins where IP
addresses do not align to the expected user’s geographic location.
Look for one IP used for multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.
Look for “impossible travel.” Impossible travel occurs when a user logs in from
multiple IP addresses that are a significant geographic distance apart (i.e., a
person could not realistically travel between the geographic locations of the two
IP addresses during the time period between the logins). Note: implementing
this detection opportunity can result in false positives if legitimate users apply
VPN solutions before connecting into networks.
Look for processes and program execution command-line arguments that may
indicate credential dumping, especially attempts to access or copy the
ntds.dit file from a domain controller.
Look for suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or
applying user account mitigations.




●

Look for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.
Look for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated
with normal user activity, which may indicate bot activity.

For organizations with OT/ICS systems:
o
o

Take note of unexpected equipment behavior; for example, unexpected reboots of
digital controllers and other OT hardware and software.
Record delays or disruptions in communication with field equipment or other OT
devices. Determine if system parts or components are lagging or unresponsive.

INCIDENT RESPONSE
Organizations detecting potential APT activity in their IT or OT networks should:
1. Immediately isolate affected systems.
2. Secure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup
data with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.
3. Collect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.
4. Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter
expertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that
could enable follow-on exploitation.
5. Report incidents to CISA and/or the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7
CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.
Note: for OT assets, organizations should have a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if
you lose access to—or control of—the IT and/or OT environment. Refer to the Mitigations section for
more information.
See the joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United
States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for guidance on
hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling. CISA, the FBI, and
NSA encourage critical infrastructure owners and operators to see CISA’s Federal Government
Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although tailored to federal civilian
branch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures for planning and conducting
cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail each step for both incident and
vulnerability response.
Note: organizations should document incident response procedures in a cyber incident response
plan, which organizations should create and exercise (as noted in the Mitigations section).

MITIGATIONS
CISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage all organizations to implement the following recommendations to
increase their cyber resilience against this threat.

Be Prepared
Confirm Reporting Processes and Minimize Coverage Gaps
•
•

•

Develop internal contact lists. Assign main points of contact for a suspected incident as well
as roles and responsibilities and ensure personnel know how and when to report an incident.
Minimize gaps in IT/OT security personnel availability by identifying surge support for
responding to an incident. Malicious cyber actors are known to target organizations on
weekends and holidays when there are gaps in organizational cybersecurity—critical
infrastructure organizations should proactively protect themselves by minimizing gaps in
coverage.
Ensure IT/OT security personnel monitor key internal security capabilities and can identify
anomalous behavior. Flag any identified IOCs and TTPs for immediate response. (See table 1
for commonly observed TTPs).

Create, Maintain, and Exercise a Cyber Incident Response, Resilience Plan, and
Continuity of Operations Plan
•
•

Create, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations plan.
Ensure personnel are familiar with the key steps they need to take during an incident and are
positioned to act in a calm and unified manner. Key questions:
o Do personnel have the access they need?
o Do they know the processes?

•

For OT assets/networks,
o Identify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to—or
control of—the IT and/or OT environment.
 Identify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or
manual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated if the connections
create risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test
contingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety critical functions can
be maintained during a cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate
at necessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.
o Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or
OT networks need to be taken offline.
o Implement data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks. Backup
procedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis. Regularly test backup
procedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could
enable the spread of malware.

Page 8 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-011A

TLP:WHITE

CISA | FBI | NSA

TLP:WHITE
o

In addition to backing up data, develop recovery documents that include configuration
settings for common devices and critical OT equipment. This can enable more efficient
recovery following an incident.

Enhance your Organization’s Cyber Posture
CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend organizations apply the best practices below for identity and
access management, protective controls and architecture, and vulnerability and configuration
management.

Identity and Access Management
•
•
•

•
•

Require multi-factor authentication for all users, without exception.
Require accounts to have strong passwords and do not allow passwords to be used across
multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have access.
Secure credentials. Russian state-sponsored APT actors have demonstrated their ability to
maintain persistence using compromised credentials.
o Use virtualizing solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are
securely stored.
o Disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory.
o Consider disabling or limiting New Technology Local Area Network Manager
(NTLM) and WDigest Authentication.
o Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (Refer to Microsoft:
Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For Windows
Server 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).
o Minimize the Active Directory attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting activity.
Malicious activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ TGS and can
be used to obtain hashed credentials that attackers attempt to crack.
Set a strong password policy for service accounts.
Audit Domain Controllers to log successful Kerberos TGS requests and ensure the events are
monitored for anomalous activity.
o Secure accounts.
o Enforce the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the
minimum permission they need to do their tasks.
o Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of
administrative tasks.
o Create non-privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the nonprivileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).

Protective Controls and Architecture
•

Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate lateral movement by a
threat actor or malware. Use network monitoring tools and host-based logs and monitoring
tools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools are particularly

Page 9 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-011A

TLP:WHITE

CISA | FBI | NSA

TLP:WHITE

•

useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon
network connections for each host.
Enable strong spam filters.
o Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.
o Filter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching end users.
o Implement a user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious
websites or opening malicious attachments.

Note: CISA, the FBI, and NSA also recommend, as a longer-term effort, that critical infrastructure
organizations implement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and
functionality. Network segmentation can help prevent lateral movement by controlling traffic flows
between—and access to—various subnetworks.
•

•

Appropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network
segmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network
is compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated communication
between the IT and OT networks.
Organize OT assets into logical zones by taking into account criticality, consequence, and
operational necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones and
deploy security controls to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones.
Prohibit ICS protocols from traversing the IT network.

Vulnerability and Configuration Management
•

Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network
assets, in a timely manner. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities, especially those
CVEs identified in this CSA, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote
code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment.
o Consider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a riskbased assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones that should
participate in the patch management program.
o Consider signing up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability
scanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service
evaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP
addresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.

•

Use industry recommended antivirus programs.
o Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets
using up-to-date signatures.
o Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are
identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.

•

Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and
mitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security
weaknesses.

Page 10 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-011A

TLP:WHITE

CISA | FBI | NSA

TLP:WHITE
•

Disable all unnecessary ports and protocols
o Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary
ports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control
activity.
o Turn off or disable any unnecessary services (e.g., PowerShell) or functionality within
devices.

•

Ensure OT hardware is in read-only mode.

Increase Organizational Vigilance
•

Regularly review reporting on this threat. Consider signing up for CISA notifications to receive
timely information on current security issues, vulnerabilities, and high-impact activity.
