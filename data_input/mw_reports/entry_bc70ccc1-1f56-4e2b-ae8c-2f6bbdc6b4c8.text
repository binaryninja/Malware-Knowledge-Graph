Whitepaper / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data

Executive Summary
Media reports show that targeted cyber attacks against government and commerce have
been ongoing since at least 2003 and possibly some time before that. By far the largest
sponsor of these attacks is the Chinese state. This is not a new problem; it is espionage with a
different methodology.
These attacks are far from random or indiscriminate. These attacks are designed to steal
information that will fulfil a clear set of requirements set by the Chinese state and furnish
them with political, commercial and security/intelligence information. These requirements
are carefully and clearly identified, shared with a number of government departments and
constantly updated. There is evidence of worldwide targeting but only a minority of attacks
are identified and fewer still made public.
This is a structured program and the main protagonists in China are widely believed to be
the Third Department of the People’s Liberation Army. Even using conservative estimates it is
likely that the program employs thousands of military personnel. While the military program
may be the most developed and sophisticated, it is likely that other parts of the Chinese
state and even the private sector may also be carrying out similar attacks.
There are clues to the companies and types of data most at risk. In particular the Five Year
Plan1 and the National Outline for Medium and Long Term S&T Development2 give detail on
the areas in which China intends to excel and identifies specific technology which the
Chinese want to develop or otherwise acquire. Electronics, telecoms, manufacturing,
extraction, energy, biotech, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, space and defence are sectors
at the highest risk, alongside companies and services such as law and accountancy firms
that support them and hold their data.
The likely recipients of stolen commercial data are the 117 Chinese State Owned Enterprises
that dominate the economy. These companies are closely linked to the state and the
Communist Party which has power over strategy, senior management and even wages.
Companies with SOE competitors should be especially concerned about data security.
Two factors make western governments and companies more vulnerable to Chinese
targeted cyber attacks. Firstly, there is reluctance for governments and companies to
accuse China directly or take any form of action for fear of either being isolated politically
or being blocked from a lucrative developing market. Secondly, a long term reliance on
traditional security products such as anti-virus, coupled with a lack of education about the
threat, leaves businesses vulnerable to attack and unprepared for any investigations that
are required in the aftermath of a compromise.
Context has extensive experience of detecting and investigating targeted attacks and
working with clients to help protect their data.

Whitepaper / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data

Introduction
There have been many media reports in recent years about cyber attacks on governments
and a variety of private sector companies. The rather ambiguous term ‘Advanced Persistent
Threat’3 (‘APT’) is widely used to describe any attack that appears to have compromised
computers in these companies or organisations, regardless of the source or purpose of the
attack. We prefer simply to call them ‘targeted attacks’ and leave marketing terms to one
side. This paper is not concerned with the technical aspects of targeted attacks, it seeks
instead to inform readers about the full scope and nature of these attacks, the reasons why
they are launched and the people and policies behind their design and execution.
Many reports of attacks inevitably end by asking ‘who did it?’ But the answer is rarely
straightforward. Western Governments usually allege the attacks come from ‘Asia’ or the
‘Far East’, rather than risk offending the Chinese government. Large corporations are
similarly vague in their descriptions of these events, for fear of harming lucrative business
arrangements. Security ‘experts’ always caution that IP addresses can be used as hop
points through which attackers disguise their true origins, so perhaps this could be a case of
other countries trying to make it look as if China was the source. While this is true, if
something looks, walks and quacks like a duck, it is almost always a duck.
We will not be so coy. This paper will look directly at the most prolific sponsor of computer
network exploitation attacks: China. We know other countries have implemented similar
programs for attacking computer networks and have seen many examples of these in our
work over the last few years, but our focus here is China.
We will examine various aspects of these attacks, including the nature of the information
targeted and the types of organisations threatened. We will consider the effort involved in
planning, executing and managing these attacks; and assess the information products they
generate, in order to understand the scale of human involvement and the government
policies that sponsor information theft via targeted attacks. With all this in mind we will then
postulate on where the stolen information goes and how it may be used.

3 Advanced Persistent Threat has recently become a catch all term for targeted attacks

against computer networks and is often used to describe the malware. In fact, the term was
first coined by the United States Air Force in 2006, specifically to refer to China – without
actually saying China. ‘Advanced’ because the attackers could use a variety of attacks to
get access to a network and could raise their game to use zero day vulnerabilities if
necessary; ‘Persistent’ because the attacks would not stop until the attacker had achieved
their objectives; and ‘Threat’ because this attack was not automated like a botnet, but was
conducted by humans who adapt and evolve their methods to evade defences.

Categorising Attacks
Many commentators have divided the targets of attacks into four categories: political,
economic, technical and military. This works as a general model, but focuses on the target
of the attack as a whole rather than considering the type of information the attacker seeks
to steal. If a criminal gang unleashes a phishing attack aimed at harvesting banking
credentials and it is the employees of a butchers shop and a bakery that fall victim to it, that
does not mean the attack was targeting bread and meat.
Bearing this in mind, we divide target areas into the following categories:
Political. The information targeted will inform the state on the political positions of
other governments on a range of issues, including economics, trade and human
rights. Typical targets are government departments, embassies, trade bodies, NGOs,
and international political groups such as the UN, G20, World Bank and IMF.
Commercial. The information targeted will be of value to the private sector within
that country (even if the lines between private and public sectors are blurred). It may
include IPR, product designs, negotiating positions for sales discussions, mergers and
acquisitions information and strategic plans (particularly in relation to the attacking
country).
Intelligence. The information targeted here will be used to safeguard internal security
by the attacker country (this may entail intimidation or close monitoring of minority or
opposition groups or individuals) and to enable analysis of the military technology,
capabilities and intentions of other countries.
There are a number of major problems that need to be overcome when seeking a
complete understanding of the scale and purpose of attacks. Many will never be detected,
those that are may not always be reported; and the vast majority are not investigated by
professionals with a good understanding of these types of attack. Dealing with the technical
aspects of the compromise alone is not enough: the victim needs to know why they were
being attacked, by whom, what data was stolen and where it may go.
While government agencies, such as the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure4
(CPNI) in the UK and the FBI5 in the US, are working successfully with larger organisations to
identify potential threats, reduce the risk of successful attacks and in some cases to identify
and investigate specific compromises, this assistance is not available to every company. It is
not generally available to those that need it the most – companies that innovate and excel
in niche areas and supply technology or products that other companies make use of in
larger projects. These companies live and die by the success of their research and
development, but often lack the budgetary resources or expertise required to adequately
protect their networks from this type of threat.
Even when compromises are investigated by companies that understand the attackers and
their motives, it is often not felt to be in the interests of either party to publish the findings of
those investigations, or to share the results with the affected company’s competitors, who

may be suffering from similar attacks. There is also a widespread lack of understanding of
targeted attacks among IT staff, a lack of dedicated IT security personnel and, sometimes as
a consequence of IT functions being outsourced, an over-reliance on traditional security
products such as anti-virus and firewalls – both of which are ineffective against even lower
end targeted attacks. The pressure exerted on IT staff from the business is primarily
concerned with service uptime and availability rather than security; and budgets for even
routine security operations such as penetration testing are under constant pressure. It is a
sad fact that, for many businesses, money for IT security only becomes available once a
serious problem has been identified, by which time it is often too late.
One more common problem in private sector companies is that some managers take the
attitude that they would prefer not to know about security problems. Information
Technology departments may worry that commissioning a detection exercise to find
compromised hosts in their environment, could reveal a series of attacks and the theft of
data, which might not be good for their career prospects. Higher up the management
chain, board members may even choose not to spend money on security on the grounds
that this will affect profitability and perhaps the size of their salaries or bonuses. They may
instead prefer to postpone any major spending on security until they absolutely have to.

Why Cyber?
Clearly, the Chinese government is keen to understand the political decisions taken by other
countries and the activities of opposition groups within China, so it is hardly surprising that it
orchestrates the compromise of computers via emailed Trojan attachments or links to
compromised websites on a large scale. This is nothing new; just traditional espionage with a
new methodology.
Until recently China, like most other developed countries, would have hand-picked
intelligence officers from universities and the military, trained them in the arts of developing
relationships, recruiting agents and how to covertly gather information to pass back to
Beijing. They would have been deployed to embassies overseas or under a business cover.
The arrival of the Internet did not sound the death knell for human spying, it simply offered
an attractive alternative. Moving espionage operations into the virtual world brings some
advantages. Firstly, it does not require anyone to be sent overseas. This is an important
change for the governments of communist countries, naturally suspicious of the long term
intentions of even their most trusted officials. It means there is less need to invest in lengthy
training processes. Instead, hacking operations can be broken down into simple tasks and
partly automated to minimise the need for operators with advanced technical skills.
Conducting these operations is cheap and carries a lesser risk than human espionage: even
if the target is fairly certain as to the origin of an attack, the sponsoring government can
claim to be a victim of mistaken identity or of a western conspiracy.
But the key benefit of this type of espionage is that any piece of information stored
anywhere in the world on a computer or a network connected to the Internet is only a few
clicks away from being stolen. There are even attacks that are designed to jump to
computers not connected to the Internet. If the prize is great enough and the attacker is
determined enough, there is always a way.

Whitepaper / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data

How Cyber?
This paper is not concerned with ‘how’ the attacks happen, which is a subject for a white
paper in its own right. Typically however, the attackers target the desktops and laptops of
the victim’s organisation and send emails with an attachment containing an exploit, (often
an Adobe PDF or Microsoft Office document) that is targeted at one person. Once the
victim opens the attachment the exploit executes, typically downloading and automatically
installing a Trojan, which the attacker can then use to access the victim’s system. The
attackers also utilise website vulnerabilities which exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers such
as Internet Explorer or Firefox to download malicious code onto a machine when a user
clicks on a link in an email. Once the attacker has this foothold on the network, they
typically look to download and use further hacking tools to escalate privileges to gain
administrative access to key internal servers such as Domain Controllers or File Servers. Once
achieved, the attackers typically use another remote desktop or laptop on the network to
collate the data stolen and exfilitrate it to their remote servers.
In the case that a network is fully patched and constitutes a hard target, the attackers can
respond and raise their game substantially. This could include exploiting a zero day
vulnerability6 or employing other means of installing an implant, such as using physical
access to introduce an attack or even attacking a supply chain.

The Targets
Despite opening up greatly over the last 15 years, China is still very much run by the
Communist Party. The Party has control over and involvement in every area of daily life, but
despite the internal focus, China is careful to keep an eye on the outside world and how the
country’s institutions and companies are perceived by foreign governments. An
understanding of other countries’ political positions on key issues that affect China is key to
forward planning, especially for an economy built on cheap exports.
The governments in which the Chinese state is most interested fall into three groups: its
nearest neighbours: Japan, Taiwan, the disputed (semi-autonomous) Tibet, Mongolia and
the Muslim ‘Stans’ to the west; other powerful states with international influence such as the
US, Russia, the UK, Germany, France and India; and finally states with strong economic links
to China including Brazil, Iran, Australia, parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.
Whilst China will not be interested in the entire spectrum of government affairs in each of
these countries, there will be some interest in some parts of all these governments’ activities.
Gathering information on this scale is a massive task: monitoring relevant issues, identifying
individuals with access to that information and crafting attacks in the appropriate form and
language.
The other constant preoccupation of the Chinese government is the maintenance of
internal and external security. The enemies of the internal state are referred to as the ‘Five
Poisons’: the separatist Uighurs (a mainly Muslim group in Northeast China), Tibetan
separatists, pro-democracy supporters, supporters of an independent Taiwan and followers
of the religious group Falun Gong. Keeping tabs on these groups and on their known
supporters at home and overseas is another huge task. The Ministry of State Security monitors

6 A zero day vulnerability is one which is not publicly known and for which no patch exists.

the communications between individuals and groups, a task made considerably easier
through the deployment of Trojans to compromise computer equipment. As a minimum,
security services would usually seek to steal email account login and password details in
order to be able to log in remotely and read emails. Google has confirmed this activity was
taking place on the Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents.7
China wants a clear picture of other countries’ military activities in order to inform its own
tactical and strategic decisions. Human penetrations of foreign military organisations are
extremely difficult and carry significant risks, so relatively passive email attacks are an
excellent substitute activity, where no single incident can be seen as an act of aggression
meriting a military response. It remains to be seen whether thousands of attacks conducted
over a long period of time will come to be regarded as having been a provocative act
warranting a military response.
While China has been publicly – albeit mostly not directly – accused of carrying out attacks
against governments, military organisations and military contractors numerous times, there
are also plenty of examples of private sector organisations being targeted. Several stand
out from the last few years: the ‘Aurora8’ attacks that hit Google, Adobe, Juniper, Northrup
Grumman and others; the McAfee-dubbed ‘Night Dragon9’ attacks that struck companies
around the world in the energy sector; and the ‘Shady RAT 10’ attacks that affected the steel
industry, heavy engineering, construction and communications companies and others.
Interestingly, despite reporting on the intrusions, McAfee does not highlight the fact that antivirus software did little to stop the attacks in the first place. In all likelihood all these various
‘operations’ formed part of the same attack, with different groups or military units carrying
out operations sponsored by the Chinese state. One attack that was clearly carefully
planned, and equally linked to the others, was that conducted against RSA11, whereby
attackers stole information which allowed them to replicate the SecurID tokens used by
companies to authenticate individuals logging onto their networks from remote locations.
Armed with those stolen credentials, an attacker would be able to log in to company
networks as if a real user. The full extent of this breach has not been publicly disclosed,
though we do know that Lockheed Martin was attacked and we can speculate that other
defence contractors were also targeted. As full details of what was stolen have never been
put into the public domain, we can only guess at the targeted information. Google claimed
Intellectual Property had been stolen, though no further details were given. But these
companies were all targeted for a reason. Data was identified that would somehow be of
use to China. We will look at who laid out the requirements for this data next.

The Requirements
We should never think of Chinese cyber attacks as
uncoordinated, random or indiscriminate. They target
companies, governments or individuals because a specific
requirement has been identified. Context has studied a
number of Chinese government policies, documents and
stated aspirations, as well as Chinese commercial structures,
which may show why targets may have been picked; and
may also help companies to gauge whether their business
should consider itself to be at risk of being targeted by a
Chinese attacker.
The key documents are the Five Year Plan and the National
Outline for Medium and Long Term S&T Development. We
will also theorise around the (unwritten) intelligence
requirements. We will then later investigate China’s state-owned enterprises as potential
generators of requests for material to be stolen via targeted attacks; and as consumers of
stolen data.
The Five Year Plan is a series of development initiatives, both social and economic, that set
high level goals for where the Communist Party would like to see the country in five years’
time. The latest Plan was finalised in October 2010 and applies to the period 2011 – 2015. It
contains goals for urbanisation rates and targets for economic growth; details the foreign
industries that will be invited to do business in China, the scale of proposed construction
projects and areas of the country/economy where further development should be
encouraged. These high level goals filter down to all government departments at national,
regional and local level, where individual initiatives are managed. But the plan also hints at
the areas where China feels it needs to concentrate its efforts, or where it needs to catch up
with other countries elsewhere in the world.
However, targeted attacks are ‘state sponsored’, which means that it is not the government
that conducts the attack, but departments of the state or affiliated groups. When the
government decides that, for example, it requires intelligence relating to US military
operations in Afghanistan, different parts of the state intelligence apparatus will respond to
this requirement, each bringing different skill sets to bear on the problem of finding the
required information. For example, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has departments with
access to satellite photography, which could provide information on troop movements.
Another department may have access to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), which intercepts
communications. Chinese diplomats in the country will speak with their Afghan counterparts
about the situation, while intelligence officers, perhaps in diplomatic or even non-official
roles, are able to exploit human agents with access to useful reporting. To complement all of
these sources, cyber attacks can be used against a variety of targets such as the Pentagon,
military forces in theatre, the US embassy, defence contractors and representatives of the
UN and NATO. As cyber proves its worth (if it hasn’t already) other parts of the government
will seek to develop their own cyber capability to add to their existing capabilities, not
wishing to be outshone by competing departments.
One of the points on the Five Year Plan for instance is ‘More efficient development of
nuclear power under the precondition of ensured safety’, which could suggest that any
information gathering attacks against the nuclear energy industry (as opposed to sabotage

or Stuxnet12 style attacks) could be carried out with the express intention of supporting this
part of the Plan.
The attacks could be directed against nuclear plants themselves in an attempt to obtain
operating information; construction companies, to steal building plans (which may also be
of value to the military in case of war); regulatory bodies for rules, policies and procedures;
and any of the hundreds of companies that build parts for the plant or develop technology
used in the nuclear process.
In terms of who could be carrying out the attacks, we have to consider not only the military
(the Third Department of the PLA has the remit for cyber operations, though other areas are
likely to have some capability too), but also nuclear construction companies, the
government department with a remit for the energy industry, or any of the hacking groups
that are closely affiliated to the state. Different campaigns may even be competing to steal
the same information with the rewards going to the attackers who get it first.
The Plan also advocates the development of high-end manufacturing, hi-tech industry,
modern agriculture, high-speed rail and hydropower. The Plan does not explain in any detail
how this development will be achieved, although in some cases it does specify that certain
areas will be prioritised for direct foreign investment. In these cases, foreign firms are invited
to partner with local firms to complete a project and engage in ‘technology transfer’. This
means (officially) that the Chinese company will learn skills from the foreign company and
develop their own capabilities in the area. Unofficially, it generally ends up with the foreign
company having its IP and technology stolen and then finding that it no longer has an
invitation to do business in the country.
One good example of technology transfer can be seen in the area of high speed railways.
Originally, trains were purchased from Kawasaki, Siemens and Bombardier and these
manufacturers helped create the first high speed lines which opened in 2007. Soon
afterwards China started to build its own high speed trains, modelled on those imported, but
with reconfigured components. There is an ongoing legal case brought by Kawasaki and
other Japanese companies relating to Chinese companies attempting to patent Kawasaki
technology associated with high speed rail13. The current Chinese patent laws specify that
the owner of a patent registered in China must be Chinese and that the Chinese holder will
also be favoured over any foreign claim for the same technology.
In July 2011 two high speed trains collided near Wenzhou, killing (according to state media)
40 people. There were concerns that the trains contained stolen foreign technology and it
has been suggested that this is why the wreckage was buried even before the rescue
operation had been completed. It has also been suggested in certain quarters that burying
the wreckage stopped any investigation by the manufacturers into what went wrong (and
whether or not there was stolen technology present). This action attracted widespread
criticism of the government, even from some sources within China.

Boosting Domestic Enterprise
If the Five Year Plan is short on detail, the National Outline for Medium and Long Term S&T
Development is not. This policy essentially sets out the requirement for ‘Indigenous
Innovation’, the areas where China should not rely on western technology, but should
develop a home-grown alternative. The strong desire for domestic products stems from two
issues. Firstly a suspicion that foreign technology could be used covertly in ways for which it
was not originally intended it would be used (for the benefit of the attacking country).
Secondly because in order to sustain high growth rates and satisfy domestic consumption it
is better if China manufactures products of equal capability and sells them to its own market
than it is to import goods at high prices. The plan for Indigenous Innovation drills down into
each of the areas where China wants to develop a capability in some detail, even setting
out priorities. The list of eleven areas comprises:
Energy. Oil and gas exploration, distribution and power grids, low cost renewable
energy, coal liquefaction, industrial energy efficiency
Water and Mineral Resources. Distribution, conservation, desalination, zoning and
development of resources
Environment. Pollutant control and recycling, restoration of vulnerable ecosystems,
maritime ecosystem protection, environmental change
Agriculture. Genetic resource development, disease prevention, use of agro-forest
biomass, multifunctional farming equipment, modern dairy industry
Manufacturing Industry. Basic/generic parts/components, digital intelligent design,
recycling iron and steel, marine engineering technology, engineering processes for
the defence industry
Transportation. Construction and maintenance technology, high speed rail, energy
efficient cars, traffic control systems, alternative fuel based cars
Modern Service Industry. Next generation Internet technology, high performance
computers, digital media content platforms, HD displays
Population / Health. Treatment of diseases, medical processes
Urbanisation. Green buildings, architectural energy efficiencies
Public Security. Security warning systems, bio-safety measures
Defence. [Classified]
In addition to these areas, which already contain a lot of areas that targeted western
companies operate in, there is a further list of 16 ‘Major Special Projects’. These projects are
intended to add to the overall strength of China. Previous examples of such projects include
the development of the hydrogen bomb, launching satellites, manned space flights and
hybrid rice. They are intended also to be a source of national pride. If one can see the
potential for cyber attack to enhance many of the areas outlined above, the list below
gives even more scope for the targeted theft of data from companies and governments
around the world:
Core electronic components, high-end general use chips and basic software
products
Large-scale integrated circuit manufacturing equipment and techniques

New generation broadband wireless mobile communication networks
Advanced numeric-controlled machinery and basic manufacturing technology
Large-scale oil and gas exploration
Large advanced nuclear reactors
Water pollution control and treatment
Breeding new varieties of genetically modified organisms
Pharmaceutical innovation and development
Control and treatment of AIDS, hepatitis, and other major diseases
Large aircraft
High-definition earth observation system
Manned spaceflight and lunar probe programs
Classified military projects (x3)
If we take the Major Special Projects as a Chinese technology wish list, we can assume there
are two different methods that could be used to achieve these goals. The first involves
funding research programmes in universities and companies, educating people over the
long term and encouraging a culture of research, development and innovation and an
acceptance that achievements in some areas will fall short of expectation.
The second way of viewing the challenge is that much of this technology already exists in
the rest of the world, is already proven and is (relatively) easy to obtain. Far easier to steal
the work of others, re-engineer it, improve it if practicable and necessary and be seen to be
contributing to the progression of the Chinese state; and to do so may also be personally
rewarding for members of the Party. Failure to achieve these goals would almost certainly
be seen as unacceptable.

At Risk
The companies that generate the target information are not the only ones at risk. We can
also assume that the companies that support these areas – lawyers, sub-contractors,
outsourced suppliers and any government departments with links to these firms, would also
be attacked as part of an effort to find supporting information.
So long as the product is intended for domestic consumption only, in many cases there are
minimal problems for the company targeted to have to face. Many firms would be unwilling
or unable to sell their products into China anyway – either because of a lack of global
distribution networks, or because of export restrictions, in the case of sensitive military
technologies, so the sale of an identical, stolen product would not directly harm their
business.
For example, a company that makes hi-tech export controlled widgets for the US military is
unlikely to be able to sell its product in China to the Chinese military. In any case, the
Chinese military would probably prefer to buy a Chinese product. If the widget designs are
stolen and a Chinese company makes the exact same widget, protected by a Chinese
patent, the end product could be sold to the PLA. While the original manufacturer may
rightly be concerned by this, the company would not suffer financially. Until, that is, the
product made by the Chinese firm is offered for sale around the world at a much cheaper

Whitepaper / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data

price than that for which the original product is sold, because the Chinese firm has not
needed to fund R&D. At this point, buyers who simply want a widget that works will buy the
cheaper one.
The National Outline document goes on to specify ‘Frontier Technologies’: areas such as
biotech, IT, advanced materials and manufacturing technologies, energy and marine
technology, lasers and (again) aerospace, all areas in which the West has traditionally
excelled and China has lagged behind.
The other key area that could lead to a requirement for cyber attacks is China’s
intelligence-gathering operation. This area is primarily controlled by the Party rather than the
intelligence services themselves. Requirements in this area are likely to incorporate generic
tasks to infiltrate and disrupt the activities of the Five Poisons (see above), to gather military
secrets from overseas and highlight politically useful information. That could be, for example,
intelligence on economic policies of the Eurozone countries regarding China, NATO plans
for Afghanistan, international efforts to negotiate with North Korea or reports into human
rights abuses.
The intelligence services will use all of their sources – HUMINT, SIGINT and cyber – to address
these requirements. As the list is never published we can only guess at what it contains, but
one may speculate that if intensive investigations focused on the detection of cyber attacks
against the Five Poisons (the GhostNet14 report was an excellent start), it is likely that the
same malware and infrastructure would be revealed to have been deployed.

Whitepaper / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data

How Does it Happen?
If we consider only the Chinese cyber attacks that have been reported we are only looking
at the tip of the iceberg. First, we tend only to see reports of British or American firms being
attacked, and we know that only a tiny minority of incidents are reported, because firms are
either unaware they have been attacked or are afraid that publicising an incident will
damage their brand, their company value or their personal careers. It is also likely that there
is a huge number of small to medium sized enterprises around the world that have no idea
that their crown jewels have been stolen.
Governments are unlikely to admit having lost data or to accuse China directly, for fear of
risking negative political and economic consequences. Individual victims living in China will
be unable to complain at the intrusion to their privacy, while those outside China may have
little recourse to any organisation which would take their claims seriously.
To map out the process and try to think about the scale of the attacks we must start with a
classic diagram of the intelligence cycle.

Setting Requirements
As we have already seen, China has no issue in identifying requirements. These lie across the
industrial, social and economic spectrum and represent the results of a mammoth effort to
identify weaknesses and areas for further development. Given that the requirements are
largely focussed around technical, economic and commercial development rather than
social development it is fair to expect that this exercise was not conducted by government
alone, but must have been supplemented by private sector (so far as there is one).
However, the setting of requirements covers many more areas than just cyber, so it would
not be correct to regard this effort as having been conducted simply to support electronic
attacks.

Planning and Direction
This is where things get a little bit complicated. Planning and direction activities take place
on multiple levels – at a Party level, regional level, local level, within every key government
department, inside every company with a stake in fulfilling the requirements; and especially
within the military, who evidence suggests are behind the bulk of targeted attacks.
Collection
This area covers the whole process of target
identification, malware development, crafting the
attacks, designing the social engineering, initiating
attacks, controlling implants, escalating privileges on
the victim network, uploading further tools to maintain
and develop access, finding and exfiltrating data of
interest, and cleaning up traces of the attack to hinder
investigations.
It also requires infrastructure (owned or stolen) to be
constructed to support the attack, IP addresses or
domain names updated into the implants, training of
operators, language skills, management and some
form of quality control process to enable some visibility
over how well attacks are progressing.
While much of the attack process can be automated
or simplified so it can be delegated to less technically
adept operators, the scale of the attack is such that
many skilled hackers will be needed in an advisory capacity, to conduct manual elements
of the attack, to maintain a development program and, in some cases, to share details of
the latest attack vectors and vulnerabilities with those tasked with cyber defence to protect
Chinese systems from similar attacks. There will also almost certainly be an administration
process that logs attacks and targets, collates information on target systems, feeds data into
some form of risk assessment and ensures that all ongoing attacks are focussed on the
attainment of a specific requirement. This is no small operation.
Processing and Exploitation
If 1,000 attacks are successful and all result in large amounts of data being stolen from
compromised systems, that data needs to be put into a readable format (and decrypted if
necessary), made searchable, stored in a database and translated into Chinese – and all
these operations have to be carried out in bulk and in real time or something close to it, to
allow that information to be used as quickly and effectively as possible. Of course, the
actual number of active compromises at any one time is likely to be many magnitudes
higher than 1,000!
Analysis and Production
The first problem with analysing bulk amounts of data translated from other languages is
that machine translation is often of low quality, particularly for data such as emails written
using more colloquial terms. The second issue is that a large proportion of the stolen
documents is likely to be of a highly technical nature: If you steal documents from a widget
maker then you need at least a basic knowledge of widgets to be able to understand the

Whitepaper / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data

potential value of a document and how best to exploit it. If there is a lot of widget data you
will need a lot of widget specialists or risk the data being out of date by the time it is
analysed. And just because someone understands widgets doesn’t mean that they
understand gizmos, so another team will be required to look at that data – and so on. These
analysts will provide feedback to operators, perhaps saying ‘get more’, or ‘this is no good,
get something else’. They may also provide search terms for documents. All this analysis will
then need to be written up into reports which should try to protect the source of the
information.
Dissemination
If the information is to be useful the reporting process has to be fast, in order to get useful
information to the right people. Dissemination of intelligence reports to security and
intelligence officers should be straightforward as all people in the process will have
clearances. But we can assume (although there are no guarantees) that this information is
highly classified and dissemination is carefully controlled, which makes disseminating it to
government officials a little more difficult, especially if those officials are based outside
Beijing, because encrypted links or maybe a network of trusted couriers will be required to
transport the reports.
The most difficult task will be delivering reports on commercial or technical development to
the right people. The most trusted individuals will be at the top of organisations, probably as
a result of their loyalty to the Party, but these are not necessarily the people able to
understand, interpret and exploit the information contained within the report. So the report
or elements of it must be passed downwards to those who do understand it. This means a
significant increase in the number of people who are aware, which represents a significant
risk. The Party must also decide to which companies it will pass information – if five
companies all produce widgets do you give the information on next generation widgets to
one of them, or all of them? We will look at one way the Party addresses this issue below.
Getting the dissemination right should in turn generate more requirements and help to
create a more refined requirement to feed back into the process and drive the next data
acquisition cycle.

The Scale of the Operation
Most authorities attribute responsibility for cyber attacks and intelligence gathering to the
Third Department of the PLA (3PLA) and accept that the Second Department (2PLA) may
also have a role to play. Accurate figures for the size of these Departments are not publicly
available, but the more success the attackers have, the more funding they are likely to get
for further attacks. Other branches of the military may then see the possibility for increased
funding and political glory by competing in the same space. One very thorough report by
Project 204915, a group who analyse the Asian security landscape among other topics,
details the Third Department of the PLA and outlines their broader activities and structure.
Their role is primarily SIGINT aimed at intercepting radio, telecoms and email
communications and reporting the content as intelligence. The report contains a figure
(though they make clear this is estimated) of 130,000 people being part of the 3PLA. The
2PLA is concerned with Human Intelligence (HUMINT) as well as SIGINT to support its military
intelligence mission.
So trying to work out how many people are involved in this process is only ever going to be
based on educated guesswork. If we look simply at the effort in the 3PLA, put aside all other
groups for now and take the figure of 130,000 as true, there is a very large pool of available
personnel who are able to support cyber operations. However, as we have stated above,
the 3PLA has a remit broader than simply cyber and other areas are far more established.
Numbers working in the requirements capture and planning area are probably in the low
hundreds. Trying to gauge the size of the collection effort is difficult and requires a large
margin of error. But it is fair to assume that several hundred people could do the target
development work; around a hundred dedicated specialists could work on malware
development (with the Chinese hacking community providing new tools at regular
intervals); perhaps one or two thousand low level operators (the ‘B’ team) supported by
another few hundred with more advanced skills (the ‘A’ team) who look after the most
sensitive intrusions; an infrastructure team of a few dozen; and an operational security team
of a few dozen more.
Then come the processing and analysis experts: potentially a pool of several thousand
specialists able to read and write in a wide variety of languages; hundreds if not thousands
of specialists in all of the fields of information being stolen – politics, economics, engineering,
IT, science, etc; hundreds of report writers; dozens of people processing data; and dozens
more administering the whole process.
If these very rough figures are anywhere close to reality, at least 7,000 people are directly
involved in hacking foreign computer networks for the Chinese military and processing the
output of those attacks. Potentially many thousands more see the reporting and are aware
of the sorts of results generated by these operations.

Profiting from the Product
So who is most likely to profit from the information being gathered through these attacks?
The political, economic and intelligence reporting has a clear audience, but deciding who
the commercial intelligence should be passed to presents a more taxing problem. Which
companies receive this kind of assistance? The answer may lie in the particular brand of
capitalism which China
practices.
China is no longer the
planned economy it once
was and some Chinese
companies are now among
the largest in the world. But
this is not capitalism as we
know it and these companies
are far from being truly
‘private’. All the largest
companies in China are State
Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in
which the state is the largest
(or only) shareholder. The
state can and does change company board members at will and members of the armed
forces are routinely brought into senior management roles. But in addition to simply
appointing the heads of companies, the Party also has a final say over the strategic
direction of each company, business planning processes and the size of salaries paid to
employees. After all, if companies are seen to be profiting unfairly at the expense of the
workers that could lead to political unrest.
There are currently 117 companies classed as SOEs and under the control of the Stateowned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the primary shareholder
in these companies. To give some idea of the scale of SOEs, they now comprise 80% of the
value of China’s stock market. Yet in the last 10 years, the number of SOEs has almost halved
as SASAC has pushed through mergers of companies with similar strengths to consolidate
the overall power of these companies in various sectors and make them more competitive
outside China. SASAC works alongside the Communist Party’s Organisation Department,
which acts as a human resources department and makes certain that those running these
businesses care every bit as much (if not more) about pleasing Party bosses as they do
about their success in business.
In addition to the Party’s input to the strategies pursued by these companies, the state is also
instrumental in guiding them to financial success by other means. Most significantly it
arranges cheap lines of credit, allowing companies to borrow money for expansion; and
provides a ready-made market for the company – the Party has the ability to block
competitors from any industry or to introduce policies which make competitors more
expensive. The state can also provide considerable human resources if a particular
company or industry needs to increase production suddenly: large pools of labour in China
work for the state rather than companies and so form a mobile and flexible workforce. But if
at the end of the day the products or services a company offers are outdated or of poor
quality, that company will fail. The Party has a vested interest in every SOE performing well

and becoming a national or global champion in its sector, so it may be willing to extend
help through the leveraging of intelligence sources. Note the list of companies and sectors
in Appendix A: it is clear that the companies on the list all have interests in areas which will
support the Five Year Plan and Indigenous Innovation.

Hypothetical Case Study: Aircraft Construction
One good example of how the Party could use its intelligence collection methods to benefit
an SOE is seen in the case of COMAC16, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.
COMAC is currently trying to build a large aircraft to compete with the likes of Boeing and
Airbus. In an excellent in-depth paper on Indigenous Innovation17, the US Chamber of
Commerce and strategic consulting firm ACPO Worldwide18 detail the desire of China to
build an aircraft since the crash (and subsequent re-engineering) of a Pakistan Airlines
Boeing 707 in 1971. The re-engineered plane named the Yun-10 was a complete failure as
China did not at that time possess all the necessary technology required to make it a
success.
With a rise in the use of air transport within China, domestic carriers are being forced to buy
foreign aircraft at enormous cost, whereas a home-grown aircraft could be sold much more
cheaply. The COMAC C91919 is designed to rival the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 and
planned to be operating by 2015, and to encourage foreign companies to share their
technology, China has promised access to the market. Companies including Parker
Aerospace, General Electric, Honeywell and Goodrich have all signed up. Whether they
benefit from this move in the long term, or are instead encouraged to leave once they have
been bled dry of useful information, remains to be seen. But for all the help they are getting,
Chinese engineers are not yet able to access the technology developed by Boeing and
Airbus, or by large aeroplane engine suppliers such as Rolls Royce.
We know therefore that there is intent to build a domestic airliner and that previously reengineering has been attempted. Technology transfer is ongoing at the moment, but how
(hypothetically) could computer network exploitation attacks help China achieve its goal?
It is hard to imagine that a project of that size would not be given some assistance by the
government, given that there is national pride at stake. If intelligence or military resources
could be directed against Boeing and Airbus networks there would be some very quick wins.
Not only could design documents and technical information be stolen en masse and
without the need to actually deal with the company, but there could be some weak links in
the supply chains of these companies which would help an attacker to penetrate their
networks.
First, smaller suppliers would provide an easy target from where attacks could be launched
directly, spoofing emails with Trojans to improve the chance of recipients opening them.
Second, both companies have facilities in China, presumably with network connectivity
which may provide a direct route into the main network. There are also Chinese citizens
working for the two target organisations who could be tasked to download something
nefarious or plug in a USB drive to help their country.

Finally all large organisations share large amounts of their data with third parties such as law
firms and consultants; companies that may not protect their networks as effectively as the
target company. These ‘data aggregators’ can present a major vulnerability in the security
of sensitive data.
The end goal of the project is to sell the aircraft worldwide and to undercut the established
suppliers. COMAC could achieve this by using lines of credit at favourable rates from the
Chinese banks that would help to make deals cheaper for airlines purchasing aircraft. But
what really helps these companies undercut foreign rivals is that they have not needed to
spend huge amounts of money on R&D to get the plane off the ground in the first place.
If designs for the body of the aircraft could be stolen along with aerodynamic information it
would cut development time by years; and by billions of dollars. If stolen engine designs
were also used that would cut costs further still. Even if the companies from whom this
technology had been stolen were able to see that it had been stolen, they would only be
able to take limited action in response; and to do so could put at risk their continued ability
to operate or sell in China.
The list of SOEs in “Appendix A” is dominated by transport companies (rail, aerospace and
shipping), energy (petrochemical, nuclear, power generation/distribution, hydro), telecoms
(mobile, infrastructure), manufacturing, extraction/metals (coal, iron, steel, minerals,
aluminium) and trading companies. If a company has been targeted by Chinese state
sponsored cyber espionage, we believe that any information stolen probably ends up in
one of these SOEs. While China is able to manipulate market conditions in various ways to
help SOEs prosper, nothing would contribute more to their growth and success than a supply
of inside information about the activities of their competitors and customers.

Conclusion
This situation has not developed overnight. These attacks have been going on for years:
many reports detail intrusions going back to 2003 and earlier. It is quite possible that the
targets of early attacks were merely foreign governments and dissidents and that the range
of targets only broadened with the opening of the Chinese economy and an increased
demand for intelligence to support business growth and projects of national importance.
The more success the attackers had, the more that demand grew. While China continues to
carry out cyber attacks on companies throughout the rest of the world and these attacks
continue either unnoticed or unpunished, there is no incentive for China to stop. The more
that stolen data is exploited for the benefit of companies and the government, the greater
the incentive to continue with these operations.
Governments and large companies do not appear to be making much headway in solving
this problem. For large corporations in the West, where there is a tendency to focus more on
the short term and on personal achievement rather than the long term advancement of the
state, the potential riches which trade with China offers are so large that turning a blind eye
to data theft may seem a reasonable price to pay. Governments dare not risk isolation from
China for economic and political reasons. Norway has recently been shut out of Chinese
relations after awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to a jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo20. Its
trade links with China are minimal, so it can afford to do this, but few other countries would
feel able to do the same. A combination of this reluctance to act, chronic under-investment
in IT and a lack of user education about how to spot the warning signs of a potential attack
means companies and organisations are extremely vulnerable.
In order to start rectifying the problem there is a need in the first instance to understand the
problem. There needs to be an acceptance that this problem is not going to go away, that
this is a business risk not at IT issue. Doing business with China carries extra risk in terms of data
security and traditional security products are unable to defend your data against this type
of attack. Investigation of compromises needs to be thorough and conducted by people
familiar with this problem and not simply the technical aspects of it. Above all sensitive data
must be segregated – it is not possible to defend everything.
The reason targeted attacks pose such a dangerous threat is that these are not viruses
which simply spread and act according to a set of defined rules in the software. There are
human beings directing these attacks in a much more active way. They have been given
specific duties and will not stop what they are doing until someone tells them to do so.
If your data is of interest today, it will still be of interest tomorrow. If you have been attacked
once and somehow managed to stop it, you have only stopped one instance of the attack,
not the attack as a whole. The malware used simply provides a foothold in the network, an
initial point of access through which other tools can be uploaded to allow attackers access
over the longer term, to navigate through the network until they find the data of interest to
them. If one technique doesn’t work, they will adapt their methods and raise their game
until they have success.
It may be that one day western governments will decide that ‘if you can’t beat them, join
them’ and develop similar capabilities to be used against foreign governments and

companies. We can only speculate as to how China might react to the large-scale
targeting of its own companies and institutions. As for now, we have limited evidence of
large companies failing as a direct result of the attacks, though there seems to be
consensus that Chinese intrusions at least contributed to the downfall of one time telecoms
giant Nortel21. We do not yet know how many others may follow.
