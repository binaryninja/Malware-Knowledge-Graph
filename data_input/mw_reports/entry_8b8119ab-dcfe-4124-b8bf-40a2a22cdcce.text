INTRODUCTION
Supply chain attacks are a very effective way to distribute malicious software into target
organizations. This is because with supply chain attacks, the attackers are relying on the trust
relationship between a manufacturer or supplier and a customer. This trust relationship is then
abused to attack organizations and individuals and may be performed for a number of different
reasons. The Nyetya worm that was released into the wild earlier in 2017 showed just how potent
these types of attacks can be. Frequently, as with Nyetya, the initial infection vector can remain
elusive for quite some time. Luckily with tools like AMP the additional visibility can usually help
direct attention to the initial vector.

Talos recently observed a case where the download servers used by software vendor to distribute
a legitimate software package were leveraged to deliver malware to unsuspecting victims. For a
period of time, the legitimate signed version of CCleaner 5.33 being distributed by Avast also
contained a multi-stage malware payload that rode on top of the installation of CCleaner.

'__scrt_get_dyn_tls_init_callback' was modi
to call
to the code at
CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C). This was done to redirect code execution ow within the
Cisco Smart Install Scanner
CCleaner binary to the malicious code prior to continuing with the normal CCleaner operations.
The code that is called is responsible for
decrypting data which contains the two stages of the
ROPMEMU
malicious payload, a PIC (Position Independent Code) PE loader as well as a DLL le that
effectively functions as the malware payload. The malware author had tried to reduce the
detection of the malicious DLL by ensuring the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER was zeroed out, suggesting
this attacker was trying to remain under the radar to normal detection techniques.
The binary then creates an executable heap using
HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE,0,0). Space is then allocated to this new heap
which is where the contents of the decrypted data containing the malware is copied. As the data
is copied to the heap, the source data is erased. The PE loader is then called and begins its
operation. Once the infection process has been initiated, the binary erases the memory regions
that previously contained the PE loader and the DLL le, frees the previously allocated memory,
destroys the heap and continues on with normal CCleaner operations.
The PE loader utilizes position independent coding practices in order to locate the DLL le within

following section.

While analyzing this malware, Talos identi ed what appears to be a software bug present in the

computed IP address located in the following registry location, but currently does nothing with it:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Piriform\Agomo:NID
It is unknown what the purpose of this IP address is at this time, as the malware does not appear

This isn't a vulnerability. The 5.33 installer had malware included with it during the time
window indicated in the blog. If you upgraded from 5.33 which was installed in the above

Is it possible for antivirus software to "clean the malware out" or is reinstalling the system
necessary?

That really depends on how the antivirus program works. Generally speaking I
would recommend reinstalling but if you don't have backups you could try

Uninstalling the tool will not remove the malware. To remove the malware you
should restore from a previous backup that is known to be clean or try a virus
removal tool.

It only took the reversing
team 2 days to reverse the malware. There were no

symbols of debugger info contained in the binary. Just good old reverse
engineering on our end.FreeSentry

I manage the Antivirus systems for my Employer's business here at Triella in Canada and I
have evidence from Webroot that this started much earlier than August. We have a client
record

of

a

blocked

CCLeaner.exe

detection

on

June

25th

agged

as

W32.Hacktool.Rpdpatch
We were lucky that I did not whitelist the threat as safe becasue at the time Webroot had a
problem with mis-categorizing legitimate software as malware. This threat was found on
a server and since we regularly used CCleaner on desktops but not servers, I was
suspicious of it and contacted Webroot support about it as well. I am going to be posting
an article on our website about this shortly.
