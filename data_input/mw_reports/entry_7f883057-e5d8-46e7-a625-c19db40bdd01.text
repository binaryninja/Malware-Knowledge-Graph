APT Actors Exploiting Newly Identified Vulnerability in
ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-259a

Summary
This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and
Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework, Version 8. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for
referenced threat actor tactics and for techniques.
This joint advisory is the result of analytic efforts between the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), United States Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER), and the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to highlight the cyber threat associated with active
exploitation of a newly identified vulnerability (CVE-2021-40539) in ManageEngine
ADSelfService Plus—a self-service password management and single sign-on solution.
CVE-2021-40539, rated critical by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), is an
authentication bypass vulnerability affecting representational state transfer (REST)
application programming interface (API) URLs that could enable remote code execution. The
FBI, CISA, and CGCYBER assess that advanced persistent threat (APT) cyber actors are
likely among those exploiting the vulnerability. The exploitation of ManageEngine
ADSelfService Plus poses a serious risk to critical infrastructure companies, U.S.-cleared
defense contractors, academic institutions, and other entities that use the software.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to place webshells, which
enable the adversary to conduct post-exploitation activities, such as compromising
administrator credentials, conducting lateral movement, and exfiltrating registry hives and
Active Directory files.
Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus build 6114, which Zoho released on September 6,
2021, fixes CVE-2021-40539. FBI, CISA, and CGCYBER strongly urge users and
administrators to update to ADSelfService Plus build 6114. Additionally, FBI, CISA, and
CGCYBER strongly urge organizations ensure ADSelfService Plus is not directly accessible
from the internet.
The FBI, CISA, and CGCYBER have reports of malicious cyber actors using exploits against
CVE-2021-40539 to gain access [T1190] to ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, as early as
August 2021. The actors have been observed using various tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs), including:
Frequently writing webshells [T1505.003] to disk for initial persistence
Obfuscating and Deobfuscating/Decoding Files or Information [T1027 and T1140]
Conducting further operations to dump user credentials [T1003]
1/7

Living off the land by only using signed Windows binaries for follow-on actions [T1218]
Adding/deleting user accounts as needed [T1136]
Stealing copies of the Active Directory database ( NTDS.dit ) [T1003.003] or registry
hives
Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for remote execution [T1047]
Deleting files to remove indicators from the host [T1070.004]
Discovering domain accounts with the net Windows command [1087.002]
Using Windows utilities to collect and archive files for exfiltration [T1560.001]
Using custom symmetric encryption for command and control (C2) [T1573.001]
The FBI, CISA, and CGCYBER are proactively investigating and responding to this malicious
cyber activity.
FBI is leveraging specially trained cyber squads in each of its 56 field offices and
CyWatch, the FBI’s 24/7 operations center and watch floor, which provides around-theclock support to track incidents and communicate with field offices across the country
and partner agencies.
CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help organizations assess,
identify, and reduce their exposure to threats. By requesting these services,
organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and mitigate attack
vectors.
CGCYBER has deployable elements that provide cyber capability to marine
transportation system critical infrastructure in proactive defense or response to
incidents.
Sharing technical and/or qualitative information with the FBI, CISA, and CGCYBER helps
empower and amplify our capabilities as federal partners to collect and share intelligence
and engage with victims while working to unmask and hold accountable, those conducting
malicious cyber activities. See the Contact section below for details.

Technical Details
Successful compromise of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, via exploitation of CVE-202140539, allows the attacker to upload a .zip file containing a JavaServer Pages (JSP)
webshell masquerading as an x509 certificate: service.cer . Subsequent requests are
then made to different API endpoints to further exploit the victim's system.
After the initial exploitation, the JSP webshell is accessible at /help/adminguide/Reports/ReportGenerate.jsp . The attacker then attempts to move laterally using
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), gain access to a domain controller, dump

2/7

NTDS.dit and SECURITY/SYSTEM registry hives, and then, from there, continues the

compromised access.
Confirming a successful compromise of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus may be difficult
—the attackers run clean-up scripts designed to remove traces of the initial point of
compromise and hide any relationship between exploitation of the vulnerability and the
webshell.
(Updated November 19, 2021): APT actors are using the following suite of tools to enable
this campaign:
Dropper – a dropper trojan that drops Godzilla webshell on a system.
Godzilla – a Chinese language webshell.
NGLite – a backdoor trojan written in Go.
KdcSponge – a credential-stealing tool that targets undocumented APIs in Microsoft’s
implementation of Kerberos.
The FBI, CISA, and CGCYBER cannot confirm the CVE-2021-40539 is the only vulnerability
APT actors are leveraging as part of this activity, so it is key that network defenders focus on
detecting the tools listed above in addition to initial access vector. For more information, see:

Attack Campaign.

Targeted Sectors
APT cyber actors have targeted entities across the 16 critical infrastructure sectors,
including academic institutions, defense contractors as well as transportation, information
technology, manufacturing, communications, and finance. Illicitly obtained access and
information may disrupt company operations/logistics and subvert U.S. research across
critical infrastructure sectors.
