Media Coverage Doesn’t Deter Actor From Threatening Democratic Voters

October 21, 2020 Cory Altheide, DAnon, Sam S., and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team
On October 20, 2020, WUFT reported that Democratic-registered voters in
Florida were receiving threatening emails purporting to be from the violent, right-wing hate
group the Proud Boys. The reported emails direct recipients to “Vote for Trump or else!” in
the subject lines and indicate that the senders will “know which candidate” the recipients vote
for, in addition to claiming to have “gained access into the entire voting infrastructure.”

Proud Boys, threatening the recipient to ”Vote for Trump or else!”

October 21 messages
Multiple media outlets have reported on these messages, and on October 21,
2020, Proofpoint researchers discovered additional messages, suggesting that
the widespread media coverage did not deter the actor responsible for this activity.
While the messages sent on October 20 are from “Proud Boys
<info[@]officialproudboys[.]com>”, messages sent on October 21 are from “Proud Boys
<info[@]proudboysusa[.]com>”.

or else!”, with link to a Proud Boys-branded video
Emails from October 21 are sent from 162.13.192.136, an IP associated
with eibank[.]com. While earlier messages included no address or what appears to be the
recipient’s actual address, messages observed on October 21 have a placeholder value of
“#address#”.
The URL on the last line of the message,
“hxxps://dl.orangedox[.]com/TQ7K1cj9RVVfKRAfL6,” links to a Proud Boys-branded video
demonstrating a Kali Linux user filling out voter registration and absentee ballots for Alaskan
citizens. We only observed two intended recipients of these messages, both of whom appear
to reside in Florida. As of this posting, the video does not appear to be available via the URL
above.
The video depicts registration and ballots requested through the Federal Voting Assistance
Program’s online portal meant to aid US service members and overseas citizens. The Kali
user populates request forms with data from the Alaskan voter database while claiming each
is an active duty service member. The user then demonstrates they have repeated this
process multiple times, insinuating volumes in the thousands. It’s not clear that this would be
an effective technique to void a voter’s ballot, though attempting to register a voter in multiple
states could lead to confusion.
Upon examination of the video’s metadata, we discovered a File Modification Date/Time of
“2020:10:21 06:18:36-07:00” and Handler Vendor ID of “Apple”.

Proofpoint researchers also discovered messages from October 20 in our data. When
examining those messages, Proofpoint researchers confirmed that some of the threatening
emails contain the recipient’s home address, indicating that the sender has
information that could be used to follow through on the threats should they choose. While we
initially believed these messages were targeting universities, we’ve now observed messages
to intended recipients in the manufacturing industry, among others. We identified over a
thousand of these messages in our data, and the messages can be broken down into two
distinct sets. In addition to the “Vote for Trump or else!” subject, we also observed subjects
‘vote’, ‘voteing’ (sic) and an empty subject line.

Set One
The initial set accounts for several hundred of the messages observed with this theme. The
format of these messages appears to directly match the format of the voter records
presented on flvoters[.]com, a website operated by Tom Alciere which provides a mirror of
Florida’s voter information public records.
Messages in this set can be traced back to a PHPmailer script hosted on a likely
compromised Saudi Arabian insurance company website.

The actor accessed the PHPmailer script from a DataCamp Limited IP frequently used
for malicious purposes. Notably, messages in this set address the recipient
as “Lastname, Firstname” and do not appear to include any further personal information.

Set Two
After the set of messages using the compromised Saudi insurance company’s infrastructure,
the actor shifted to routing messages through the website of an Estonian textbook publisher,
as reported by Vice. Notably, messages in this wave include the recipient’s address-ofrecord. Nearly 1,500 messages were sent in this set, making it noticeably larger than the
set exploiting the Saudi company.

address (redacted here)
Based on our observations, the actor appears to have made small changes to their sending
script when they shifted to exploiting the Estonian publisher. Messages sent in this set
included what appears to be the recipient’s home address, while earlier messages only
mention that the actor has the recipient’s address.

Conclusion
Explicitly threatening voters to support a specific candidate is a departure from the electionthemed activity we’ve recently observed, such as impersonation of the Democratic National
Committee and various fraudulent voter registration portals. Previous activity used political
themes to entice users to click on links or open attachments but did not appear especially
politically motivated. Given the threatening and personalized nature of these messages, they
could be sincere–though likely ineffective–attempts to carry out voter intimidation via email.
