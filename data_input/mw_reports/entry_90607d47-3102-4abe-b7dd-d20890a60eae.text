ESET researchers take a deep look into recent attacks carried out by Donot Team throughout 2020 and 2021,
targeting government and military entities in several South Asian countries
Donot Team (also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02) is a threat actor operating since at least 2016 and known
for targeting organizations and individuals in South Asia with Windows and Android malware. A recent report by
Amnesty International links the group’s malware to an Indian cybersecurity company that may be selling the
spyware or offering a hackers-for-hire service to governments of the region.
We have been closely following the activities of Donot Team, and have traced several campaigns that leverage
Windows malware derived from the group’s signature yty malware framework. According to our findings, the
group is very persistent and has consistently targeted the same organizations for at least the last two years.
In this blogpost, we document two variants of the malware used in recent campaigns – DarkMusical and Gedit.
For each of the variants, we analyze the whole attack chain and provide insight into how the group updates its
tools, tactics, and techniques.

Targets
The campaigns of Donot Team are motivated by espionage, using their signature malware: the “yty” malware
framework, whose main purpose is to collect and exfiltrate data. According to our telemetry, Donot Team
focuses on a small number of targets in South Asia – Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal – as seen in
Figure 1.

These attacks are focused on:
Government and military organizations
Ministries of Foreign Affairs
Embassies
Going as far as targeting embassies of these countries in other regions, such as the Middle East, Europe, North
America, and Latin America, is also not outside Donot Team’s realm.

Try, try, try again
It’s not a rarity for APT operators to attempt to regain access to a compromised network after they have been
ejected from it. In some cases this is achieved through the deployment of a stealthier backdoor that remains
quiet until the attackers need it; in other cases they simply restart their operation with new malware or a variant
of the malware they used previously. The latter is the case with Donot Team operators, only that they are
remarkably persistent in their attempts.
According to ESET telemetry, Donot Team has been consistently targeting the same entities with waves of
spearphishing emails with malicious attachments every two to four months. Interestingly, emails we were able to
retrieve and analyze did not show signs of spoofing. Some emails were sent from the same organizations that
were being attacked. It’s possible that the attackers may have compromised the email accounts of some of their
victims in earlier campaigns, or the email server used by those organizations.
With spearphishing emails, the attackers use malicious Microsoft Office documents to deploy their malware. We
have seen Donot Team using at least three techniques. One is macros in Word, Excel and PowerPoint
documents, such as the example seen in Figure 2.

2/22

run it

The second technique is RTF files with .doc extensions that exploit memory corruption vulnerability
CVE‑2017‑11882 in Equation Editor, shown in Figure 3. These RTF documents also contain two embedded
DLLs as OLE objects (see Figure 4) that are used to install and download further components (both DLLs are
described in the Gedit section). This allows the attackers to execute shellcode and requires no user interaction.
The shellcode deploys the main components of the malware.

contains the CVE‑2017‑1182 exploit

Figure 4. The OLE object headers of the DLLs also embedded in the RTF document

The third technique is remote RTF template injection, which allows the attackers to have a payload downloaded
from a remote server when the RTF document is opened. This is achieved by inserting a URL in the optional
\*\template control word of the RTF file format, instead of the location of a local file resource. The payload that
Donot Team uses is another document that exploits CVE-2017-11882 and is loaded automatically once it is
downloaded. This is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. When Word opens an RTF file with a remote template, it automatically attempts to download the resource

The yty malware framework
Discovered by NetScout in 2018, the yty malware framework is a less sophisticated and poorly developed
successor to an older framework called EHDevel. The yty framework consists of a chain of downloaders that
ultimately download a backdoor with minimal functionality, used to download and execute further components of
Donot Team’s toolset.
These include file collectors based on file extension and year of creation, screen capturers, keyloggers, reverse
shells, and more. As seen in Figure 6, components for exfiltration gather the collected intelligence from staging
folders and upload every file to a designated server used only for this purpose.

Figure 6. Component that resolves the folder name for staging JPEG screenshots (left) and exfiltration component that
finds all files in the staging folder (right)

Staging folder names and locations are changed with almost every new campaign, as well as some of the
components’ filenames. However, there are cases in which the names of components have remained
unchanged, for example: gedit.exe, wuaupdt.exe, lmpss.exe, disc.exe, among others. As seen in Figure 7, it
seems that for every new campaign, in order to set new paths and filenames, these values must be changed in
the source code and then recompiled, as none of these components use a configuration block or file.

4/22

Figure 7. Encrypted strings containing locations and filenames that are regularly changed (top) and unencrypted values
used in constructing the C&C URL (bottom)

The malware uses scheduled tasks for persistence, and alternates between DLL and EXE files between
campaigns. In the case of DLLs, scheduled tasks execute rundll32.exe to load them and execute one of the
exported functions.
The developers of the yty framework primarily rely on the C++ programming language. Likely in an attempt to
evade detection, they have also ported their components to other languages such as VBScript, Python
(packaged with PyInstaller), Visual C#, and AutoIt, among others. However, since 2019 we have only seen them
leveraging components programmed in C++ (Figure 8) and Go (Figure 9).

The malware sometimes uses two or three servers during its deployment. It might use one server during its
chain of downloaders and a different server that the backdoor contacts in order to receive its commands and
download further components, or use the same server for both purposes. A different server is always used for
the upload of collected information. In some attacks Donot Team has reused C&C domains from previous
attacks – both for downloads and exfiltration. As seen in Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12, these components
– later described as a variant we track as DarkMusical – used in the same attack, employed three different C&C
domains.

Timeline of attacks
Here we describe the malware variants used in recent Donot Team campaigns, with a focus on their Windows
malware, starting from September 2020 until October 2021. For clarity, we have separated them into two
variants of the yty malware framework: Gedit and DarkMusical, with one specific campaign using Gedit that we
named Henos.
In Figure 13, we present a timeline, according to our telemetry, of the attacks. Also on our timeline we have
included attacks from another variant, known as the “Jaca framework”. However, we will not describe it here as
it has been described extensively in this report by CN-SEC.

Figure 13. Timeline of Donot Team attacks from September 2020 to October 2021 according to ESET telemetry

DarkMusical
According to ESET telemetry, the first wave of attacks where this variant was used occurred in June 2021,
targeting military organizations in Bangladesh. We were only able to recover its chain of downloaders and its
main backdoor. Given the small number of victims, we believe this might have been a highly targeted attack.
In September, a second wave of attacks that targeted military organizations in Nepal used new C&C servers
and file and staging folder names. We were able to recover a number of components downloaded by the
backdoor, so we have decided to describe these attacks instead.
Spearphishing emails were sent with PowerPoint documents containing a macro that deploys the first
component of a chain of downloaders and persists using a scheduled task. When potential victims open these
documents, they will be presented with a fake error message, as seen in Figure 14, and the documents will
remain devoid of any visible content.

7/22

As seen in Figure 15, the chain of downloaders aims to download a final component that works as a backdoor
with minimal functionality: it downloads standalone components, executes them using the ShellExecute
Windows API, get and saves new C&C URLs.
The backdoor downloads the components that handle the collection and exfiltration of information to a dedicated
server. These components do not communicate with the backdoor or the C&C to report on their activities –
rather, they use a designated folder for the staging of the data, and a separate exfiltration component will collect
everything and upload it.

Figure 15. Observed chain of compromise for DarkMusical

We decided to call this campaign DarkMusical because of the names the attackers chose for their files and
folders: many are western celebrities or characters in the movie High School Musical. Table 1 briefly describes
the purpose of each of the components in the chain of compromise.

Gedit
We detected the first attacks of the campaign using Gedit in September 2020, against organizations in Pakistan
that had already been targeted with spearphishing and malicious RTF documents that installed the Jaca
framework. Since then, Donot Team moved on to focus on targets in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The
malware is clearly derived from the yty malware framework, but it is distinct enough to be separated from
DarkMusical.
We were able to retrieve a spearphishing email corresponding to a Gedit campaign that occurred in February of
2021, which is shown in Figure 16. The first attachment contained a list of personnel from a military entity in
Bangladesh (and no malicious content). The second attachment showed nothing but a blank page, while
executing malicious code.

11/22

Figure 16. Screenshot of a spearphishing email sent by the attackers

We can see that the size of the second file is greater than 2 MB. It is an RTF file that exploits CVE-2017-11882
to drop two DLL files contained in the document and execute one of them. Other components are downloaded
to the compromised computer in various stages. An overview of this attack chain and its malware components is
shown in Figure 17.

12/22

The components were coded in Go, and C++ (with MinGW and Visual Studio compilers). We have chosen to
describe the components used in that campaign in February 2021, which are shown in Table 3.

Winhlp.exe

Downloads a file to %USERPROFILE%\inf\boost\OOO\nprint.exe (if it doesn’t exist or its size
is less than 50 kB).

13/22

Filename
nprint.exe

Description
Sends a request to a server and depending on the reply, three actions can be performed:
• If qwertyuiop is in the reply headers, then a file is downloaded to
%USERPROFILE%\Policy\en-us\Active\<FILENAME>, where <FILENAME> is also read from
the headers
• If asdfghjklzx is in the reply headers, then it tries to execute
%USERPROFILE%\Policy\en-us\Active\wuaupdt.exe
• If zxcvbnmlkjhgfd is in the reply headers, then it tries to execute
%USERPROFILE%\Policy\en-us\Active\test.bat
If a file %USERPROFILE%\Policy\en-us\Files\wizard exists, then the URL of the server is
retrieved from there and used instead of the one included in the executable.

wuaupdt.exe

Reverse shell.

lmpss.exe

Takes screenshots and saves them, in an infinite loop, to
%USERPROFILE%\Remote\Desk\Apps

innod.exe

File collector. Iterates recursively through drives, logging interesting files to
%USERPROFILE%\Policy\en-us\Files\nohiucf. Files are copied to
%USERPROFILE%\Remote\Desk\Apps
Seeks files with the extensions: doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pps, pptx, ppsx, pdf, inp, msg, jpg,
jpeg, png, txt
Excludes the following files/folders: ., .., nohiucf, Windows, Recent Places, Temfile,
ProgramFiles, ProgramFiles(x86), ProgramData, Microsoft, Package Cache
This component runs in an infinite loop, iterating drives from C: to H:

gedit.exe

Sends collected files to a server. All files that are in %USERPROFILE%\Remote\Desk\Apps
are sent one by one, unencrypted. There is no check for extension, other than excluding . and
..
The victim identifier that was written to %USERPROFILE%\Policy\en-us\Files\wizard is
appended to the URL. If the file doesn’t exist, then the default string HeloBSiamabcferss is
used instead. User-agent is: If people are doubting how far you can go, go so far that you can
not hear them anymore. Michele Ruiz.
It creates a system event aaaaaaaaa to make sure that only one instance of the component is
running at a time.

Henos campaign
Finally, it is worth mentioning a wave of attacks that occurred between February and March 2021, targeting
military organizations in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. These attacks used the Gedit variant of the malware, but
with some minor modifications. Therefore, we decided to name this campaign Henos in our timeline, after its
backdoor DLL – henos.dll.
Samples belonging to components of this wave of attacks were also reported online in February, which probably
explains why the group didn’t use the components again (see this tweet by Shadow Chaser Group researchers,
for example).
Although we didn’t find the corresponding spearphishing emails or malicious documents, the attack chain is
presumably the same as we described above, with some minor differences in how the components are
executed. An overview of this is shown in Figure 18.

14/22

Figure 18. Chain of compromise of the Henos campaign

While some of the components of this campaign are named javatemp.exe and pytemp.exe, these filenames
were probably only chosen in an attempt to mimic legitimate software such as Java or Python. While
pytemp.exe and plaapas.exe were coded in the Go language, javatemp.exe was coded in C++ (compiled with
MinGW).
One final note is that the component that performs exfiltration of files, pytemp.exe, performs a check to see if
gedit.exe is running. If two or more instances are found, it exits. We believe this is a mistake by the
programmers, as it should check for pytemp.exe instead. However, this simple mistake helps us tie the Henos
campaign to the Gedit variant of the malware (added to code similarity).

Conclusion
Donot Team makes up for its low sophistication with tenacity. We expect that it will continue to push on
regardless of its many setbacks. Only time will tell if the group evolves its current TTPs and malware.
