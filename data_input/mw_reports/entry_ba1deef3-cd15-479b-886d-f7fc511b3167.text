TR-64 - Exploited Exchange Servers - Mails with links to
malware from known/valid senders
circl.lu/pub/tr-64/

What have we observed?
Several organizations received complaints about the fact that their email accounts are
sending spam, phishing and infected emails to their partner organizations. The emails are
usually replies to ongoing email threads, where an attacker pastes a greeting sentence and
URLs above the original mail content.
Attackers/adversaries do that to improve the social acceptance rate of their malspam. Indeed
this strategy seems to be very successful.
Here a sample in English: (URLs are disarmed)

Monsieur,

If you receive emails like this, take care. These are links to
QBot/QakBot/DanaBot/SquirrelWaffle malware, which is a “Information Stealing” / “Cobalt
Strike Loader” malware. An infection will most likely end up in a ransomware case.
If you receive complaints about emails like this being sent from your infrastructure, be
prepared to alert your IT team or IT supplier and feel free to contact CIRCL for assistance.

Root Cause
Recently we had to deal with several critical security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange.
In March 2021, CIRCL warned about critical vulnerabilities which were initially exploited by
an activity group (called HAFNIUM by Microsoft) starting in late 2020.
TR-61 - Critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange
In late October CIRCL got notified about MS Exchange servers vulnerable for the recent
critical Exchange RCE vulnerabilities CVE-2021-26427.
Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE-2021-26427
CIRCL immediately worked through the list of vulnerable IP addresses and notified the
respective ISPs (service provider) with the request to warn their customers.
Since then, most of the vulnerable MS Exchange servers are patched (updated). But
unfortunately sometimes patching alone is not sufficient.
If the server is already compromised before successful patching, the patch will likely close
the vulnerability. But the server remains compromised. Patching alone is not sufficient
This situation is what we are looking at right now: the infrastructure is compromised,
attackers read the emails and inject their malicious content into the mail threads by replying
to the mail interaction.

Fixing and mitigation
There is only one single procedure to ensure that you completely fix and mitigate the
situation, close all potential backdoors and kick-out the attackers: re-install every
compromised server from scratch and then recover and copy the data over.
In all the cases, we recommend to initiate a full incident response process including the
security review of the system.
One of the most important questions which must get answered: Did the attackers manage to
laterally move within the internal network. If this happens your are at high risk of a crypto
ransomware or data exfiltration. This means, you will find back all your data encrypted - or
stolen.
If you have no resources for incident response and reinstall the Exchange server from
scratch, Microsoft has published guidance for responders.

Do I need to patch internal and non-exposed exchange server?
Yes.

Have you seen exploited server in Luxembourg?
Yes.

New wave of malspam
Unfortunately the initial ‘Root Cause’ leads to the next stage of attacks. It seems the
compromised Exchange servers not only were abused for spreading malspam by replying to
existing email threads. CIRCL recently received evidences that the servers also got abused
for data breach.
It seems the attackers exfiltrated a decent amount of emails from the compromised severs.
These exfiltrated emails are now traded in the Internet and used to send new waves of
malspam by replying to existing email conversations.

In case your organization was victim of the ‘Root Cause’ you should expect new waves of
malspam sent in your name. Please warn all your contacts to be vigilant and not to click a
link.
Since this kind of data leak also contains PII - personally identifiable information - we
strongly advise to report to the local data protection agency CNPD, as soon as you learn
about your organization being affected:
Commission nationale pour la protection des données
