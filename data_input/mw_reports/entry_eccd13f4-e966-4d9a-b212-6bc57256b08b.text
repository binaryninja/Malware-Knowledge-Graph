Overview
The Kronos banking Trojan was first discovered in 2014 [1] and was a steady fixture in the threat landscape for a
few years before largely disappearing. Now a new variant has appeared, with at least three distinct campaigns
targeting Germany, Japan, and Poland respectively, to date.
In April 2018, the first samples of a new variant of the banking Trojan appeared in the wild [2]. The most notable
new feature is that the command and control (C&C) mechanism has been refactored to use the Tor anonymizing
network. There is some speculation and circumstantial evidence suggesting that this new version of Kronos has
been rebranded “Osiris” and is being sold on underground markets. In this blog, we present information on the
German, Japanese, and Polish campaigns as well as a fourth campaign that looks to be a work in progress and
still being tested.
Campaign Analysis
Campaign targeting Germany, June 27-30, 2018
In June 27, 2018, we observed an email campaign targeting German users with malicious documents. The
messages (Figure 1) were purportedly sent from German financial companies and contained subjects such as:
Aktualisierung unsere AGBs (translated: “Updating our terms and conditions”)
Mahnung: 9415166 (translated: “Reminder: 9415166”)
The attached documents had a similar theme with file names such as:
agb_9415166.doc
Mahnung_9415167.doc

The Word documents contained macros that, if enabled, downloaded and executed a new variant of the Kronos
banking Trojan. In some cases, the attack used an intermediate Smoke Loader. Kronos was configured to use
http://jhrppbnh4d674kzh[.]onion/kpanel/connect.php as its C&C URL and downloaded webinjects targeting five
German financial institutions. Figure 2 shows an example webinject.

Campaign targeting Japan, July 13, 2018
Based on a tweet [3] from a security researcher, we investigated a malvertising chain sending victims to a site
containing malicious JavaScript injections. This JavaScript redirected victims to the RIG exploit kit, which was
distributing the SmokeLoader downloader malware. The C&Cs for this downloader were:
hxxp://lionoi.adygeya[.]su
hxxp://milliaoin[.]info
Based on our previous tracking of the threat actor involved in this campaign, we expected to see the chain deliver
the Zeus Panda banking Trojan (Figure 3). However, in this case, the final payload was the new version of Kronos
(Figure 4).

In this campaign, Kronos was configured to use http://jmjp2l7yqgaj5xvv[.]onion/kpanel/connect.php as its C&C and
its webinjects were targeting thirteen Japanese financial institutions. Figure 5 shows an example webinject from
this campaign.

Campaign targeting Poland, July 15-16, 2018
Starting on July 15, 2018, we observed an email campaign targeting users in Poland with malicious documents.
The messages used subjects related to fake invoices, such as “Faktura 2018.07.16”, and contained an attachment
named “faktura 2018.07.16.doc” (Figure 6). The document used CVE-2017-11882 (the “Equation Editor” exploit) to
download and execute the new version of Kronos from http://mysit[.]space/123//v/0jLHzUW.

Figure 6: Example of malicious document used in the Polish campaign
This instance of Kronos was configured to use http://suzfjfguuis326qw[.]onion/kpanel/connect.php as its C&C; at
the time of this research it was not returning any webinjects.
“Work in progress” campaign, July 20, 2018

7/13

On July 20, 2018, we observed a new campaign that looked be a work in progress and still being tested. We are
not yet aware of the exact vector for this campaign but this instance of Kronos is configured to use
hxxp://mysmo35wlwhrkeez[.]onion/kpanel/connect.php as its C&C and could be downloaded by clicking on the
“GET IT NOW” button of a website claiming to be a streaming music player (Figure 7).

At the time of research, this campaign was using a test webinject shown in Figure 8.

Malware Analysis
Kronos malware has been well-documented previously ([4] [5] [6] [7]). It is a banking Trojan that uses man-in-thebrowser techniques along with webinject rules to modify the web pages of financial institutions, facilitating the theft
of user credentials, account information, other user information, and money through fraudulent transactions. It also
has keylogging and hidden VNC functionality to help with its “banker” activities.
The new 2018 version shares many similarities with older versions:
Extensive code overlap
Same Windows API hashing technique and hashes
Same string encryption technique
Extensive string overlap
Same C&C encryption mechanism
Same C&C protocol and encryption
Same webinject format (Zeus format)
Similar C&C panel file layout
Perhaps the most telling sign that the new malware is Kronos is that it still includes a self-identifying string (Figure
9).

Figure 9: Self-identifying Kronos string
One of the major differences between the new and old versions is the use of .onion C&C URLs along with Tor to
help anonymize communications. C&Cs are stored encrypted (Figure 10) and can be decrypted using the process
shown in Figure 11.

Osiris Banking Trojan
Around the same time samples of the new version of Kronos were appearing in the wild, an ad for a new banking
Trojan called “Osiris” (the Egyptian god of rebirth, among others) appeared on an underground hacking forum
(Figure 12).

10/13

Figure 12: Text from an ad for the Osiris banking Trojan
Some of the features highlighted in the ad (written in C++, banking Trojan, uses Tor, has form grabbing and
keylogger functionality, and uses Zeus-formatted webinjects) overlap with features we observed in this new version
of Kronos.
The ad mentions the size of the bot to be 350 KB which is very close to the size (351 KB) of an early, unpacked
sample of the new version of Kronos we found in the wild [8]. This sample was also named “os.exe” which may be
short for “Osiris”.
Additionally, some file names used in the Japanese campaign discussed above made reference to the same
name:
hxxp://fritsy83[.]website/Osiris.exe
hxxp://oo00mika84[.]website/Osiris_jmjp_auto2_noinj.exe
While these connections are speculative, they are something to keep in mind as research into this threat
continues.
Conclusion
The reappearance of a successful and fairly high-profile banking Trojan, Kronos, is consistent with the increased
prevalence of bankers across the threat landscape. The first half of this year has been marked by substantial
diversity among malicious email campaigns but banking Trojans in particular have predominated. The Kronos
banking Trojan has a relatively long and interesting history and it looks like it will continue as a fixture in the threat
landscape for now. This post was an overview of a new version of the malware that has emerged recently, the
primary new feature of which is the use of Tor. While there is significant evidence that this malware is a new
version or variant of Kronos, there is also some circumstantial evidence suggesting it has been rebranded and is
being sold as the Osiris banking Trojan.
