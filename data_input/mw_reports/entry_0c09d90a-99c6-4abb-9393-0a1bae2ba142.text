In the last few days, our anti-ransomware module has been detecting a new variant of
malware – KeyPass ransomware. Others in the security community have also noticed that
this ransomware began to actively spread in August:

Notification from MalwareHunterTeam

Distribution model
According to our information, the malware is propagated by means of fake installers that
download the ransomware module.

Description
The Trojan sample is written in C++ and compiled in MS Visual Studio. It was developed
using the libraries MFC, Boost and Crypto++. The PE header contains a recent compilation
date.

PE header with compilation date

When started on the victim’s computer, the Trojan copies its executable to %LocalAppData%
and launches it. It then deletes itself from the original location.
Following that, it spawns several copies of its own process, passing the encryption key and
victim ID as command line arguments.

Command line arguments

KeyPass enumerates local drives and network shares accessible from the infected machine
and searches for all files, regardless of their extension. It skips files located in a number of
directories, the paths to which are hardcoded into the sample.

The list of excluded paths

Every encrypted file gets an additional extension: “.KEYPASS” and ransom notes named
“”!!!KEYPASS_DECRYPTION_INFO!!!.txt”” are saved in each processed directory.

Encryption scheme
The developers of this Trojan implemented a very simplistic scheme. The malware uses the
symmetric algorithm AES-256 in CFB mode with zero IV and the same 32-byte key for all
files. The Trojan encrypts a maximum of 0x500000 bytes (~5 MB) of data at the beginning of
each file.

Part of the procedure that implements data encryption

Soon after launch, KeyPass connects to its command and control (C&C) server and receives
the encryption key and the infection ID for the current victim. The data is transferred over
plain HTTP in the form of JSON.

6/16

If the C&C is inaccessible (e.g. if the infected machine is not connected to the internet or the
server is down), the Trojan uses a hardcoded key and ID, which means that in the case of
offline encryption the decryption of the victim’s files will be trivial.

GUI
From our point of view, the most interesting feature of the KeyPass Trojan is the ability to
take ‘manual control’. The Trojan contains a form that is hidden by default, but which can be
shown after pressing a special button on the keyboard. This capability might be an indication
that the criminals behind the Trojan intend to use it in manual attacks.

7/16

GUI of the trojan

This form allows the attacker to customize the encryption process by changing such
parameters as:
encryption key
name of ransom note
text of ransom note
victim ID
extension of the encrypted files
list of paths to be excluded from the encryption

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
