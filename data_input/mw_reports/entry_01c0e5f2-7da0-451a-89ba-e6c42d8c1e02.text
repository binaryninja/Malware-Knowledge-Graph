FinCEN Updates Ransomware Advisory
OFAC Sanctions Two Ransomware Operators and a Virtual Currency Exchange Network for
the Kaseya Incident and Laundering Cyber Ransoms
WASHINGTON — Continuing the Administration’s whole-of-government effort to counter
ransomware, the U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced a set of actions focused
on disrupting criminal ransomware actors and virtual currency exchanges that launder the
proceeds of ransomware. Treasury’s actions today advance the Biden Administration’s
counter-ransomware efforts to disrupt ransomware infrastructure and actors and address
abuse of the virtual currency ecosystem to launder ransom payments.
“Ransomware groups and criminal organizations have targeted American businesses and
public institutions of all sizes and across sectors, seeking to undermine the backbone of our
economy,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “We will continue to bring
to bear all of the authorities at Treasury’s disposal to disrupt, deter, and prevent future
threats to the economy of the United States. This is a top priority for the Biden
Administration.”

Ransomware incidents have disrupted critical services and businesses globally, as well as
schools, government offices, hospitals and emergency services, transportation, energy, and
food companies. Reported ransomware payments in the United States so far have reached
$590 million in the first half of 2021, compared to a total of $416 million in 2020. The
perpetrators behind these ransomware incidents seek to harm the United States and extort
the American people and our allies. Those who provide financial services to, or facilitate
money laundering for, ransomware actors enable this illegal activity.
While most virtual currency activity is licit, virtual currency remains the primary mechanism
for ransomware payments, and certain unscrupulous virtual currency exchanges are an
important piece of the ransomware ecosystem. The United States urges the international
community to effectively implement international standards on anti-money
laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in the virtual currency area,
particularly regarding virtual currency exchanges.
Today’s coordinated action with several U.S. government and foreign partners demonstrates
how Treasury’s international partnerships enhance the ability to detect and disrupt, across
continents and technologies, the illicit financial activities of those who seek to harm people’s
livelihoods, savings, and futures for private gain.

Designation of a Virtual Currency Exchange and Network for Complicit
Financial Services
Today’s actions include the designation of Chatex, a virtual currency exchange, and its
associated support network, for facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors.
Chatex, which claims to have a presence in multiple countries, has facilitated transactions for
multiple ransomware variants. Analysis of Chatex’s known transactions indicate that over half
are directly traced to illicit or high-risk activities such as darknet markets, high-risk
exchanges, and ransomware. Chatex has direct ties with SUEX OTC, S.R.O. (Suex), using
Suex’s function as a nested exchange to conduct transactions. Suex was sanctioned on
September 21, 2021, for facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors. Chatex is
being designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended, for providing
material support to Suex and the threat posed by criminal ransomware actors.
Additionally, OFAC is designating IZIBITS OU, Chatextech SIA, and Hightrade Finance Ltd
for providing material support and assistance to Chatex, pursuant to E.O. 13694, as
amended. These three companies set up infrastructure for Chatex, enabling Chatex
operations.
Complementing this action, the Department of State announced a Transnational Organized
Crime Reward offer of up to $10,000,000 for information leading to the identification or
location of any individual(s) who hold a key leadership position in the Sodinokibi/REvil
ransomware variant transnational organized crime group (22 U.S.C. §2708(b)(6)). The

2/4

Department of State also announced a reward offer of up to $5,000,000 for information
leading to the arrest and/or conviction in any country of any individual conspiring to
participate in or attempting to participate in a Sodinokibi variant ransomware incident.
Following an inspection by Latvia’s State Revenue Service, Latvian government authorities
have suspended with immediate effect the operations of Chatextech; assessed a fine for
breaches of company registration and business conduct laws and regulations; and will
identify current and former Chatextech board members, all non-Latvian nationals, in Latvia’s
registry of high-risk individuals. In addition, the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit has
revoked the license of Izibits OU after working with the United States to identify the activities
of entities being designated today.
Unprincipled virtual currency exchanges like Chatex are critical to the profitability of
ransomware activities, especially by laundering and cashing out the proceeds for criminals.
Treasury will continue to use all available authorities to disrupt malicious cyber actors, block
ill-gotten criminal proceeds, and deter additional actions against the American people.
Treasury benefitted immensely from close coordination with our partners across Latvian and
Estonian government agencies, including their information sharing and swift action.

Designation of Two Ransomware Operators
OFAC is designating Ukrainian Yaroslav Vasinskyi (Vasinskyi) and Russian Yevgeniy
Polyanin (Polyanin) for their part in perpetuating Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware incidents
against the United States. Vasinskyi deployed ransomware against at least nine U.S.
companies. Vasinskyi is also responsible for the July 2021 ransomware activity against
Kaseya, which caused significant disruptions to the computer networks of Kaseya’s customer
base. Polyanin also deployed ransomware, targeting several U.S. government entities and
private-sector companies. These two individuals are part of a cybercriminal group that has
engaged in ransomware activities and received more than $200 million in ransom payments
paid in Bitcoin and Monero. OFAC is also designating a company owned by Polyanin,
pursuant to E.O. 13694 as amended. Malicious cyber activities against the U.S. government
and private sector will be aggressively investigated and pursued. Companies are
encouraged to report all ransomware incidents to law enforcement, as well as any payments
with a potential sanctions nexus to OFAC, and strengthen their cyber defense posture.

Sanctions Implications
As a result of today’s designation, all property and interests in property of the designated
targets that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally
prohibited from engaging in transactions with them. Additionally, any entities 50 percent or
more owned by one or more designated persons are also blocked. In addition, financial
institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the

sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an
enforcement action. Today’s action does not implicate a sanctions nexus to any particular
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) or variant.

FinCEN Releases Updated Advisory on Ransomware and the Use of the
Financial System to Facilitate Ransom Payments
In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is releasing an update
today to its 2020 Advisory on Ransomware and the Use of the Financial System to Facilitate
Ransom Payments. The updated Advisory reflects information released by FinCEN in its
Financial Trend Analysis Report discussing ransomware trends, issued on October 15, 2021,
and includes information on current trends and typologies of ransomware and associated
payments as well as recent examples of ransomware incidents. The updated Advisory also
sets out financial red flag indicators of ransomware-related illicit activity to assist financial
institutions, including virtual currency service providers, in identifying and reporting
suspicious transactions associated with ransomware payments, consistent with their
obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act.
