Also known as Inception, Cloud Atlas is an actor that has a long history of cyber-espionage
operations targeting industries and governmental entities. We ﬁrst reported Cloud Atlas in 2014
and we’ve been following its activities ever since.
From the beginning of 2019 until July, we have been able to identify different spear-phishing
campaigns related to this threat actor mostly focused on Russia, Central Asia and regions of
Ukraine with ongoing military conﬂicts.

Countries targeted by Cloud Atlas recently

Cloud Atlas hasn’t changed its TTPs (Tactic Tools and Procedures) since 2018 and is still relying
on its effective existing tactics and malware in order to compromise high value targets.
The Windows branch of the Cloud Atlas intrusion set still uses spear-phishing emails to target
high proﬁle victims. These emails are crafted with Ofﬁce documents that use malicious remote
templates – whitelisted per victims – hosted on remote servers. We described one of the
techniques used by Cloud Atlas in 2017 and our colleagues at Palo Alto Networks also wrote
about it in November 2018.
Previously, Cloud Atlas dropped its “validator” implant named “PowerShower” directly, after
exploiting the Microsoft Equation vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) mixed with CVE-2018-0802.
During recent months, we have seen a new infection chain, involving a polymorphic HTA, a new
and polymorphic VBS implant aimed at executing PowerShower, and the Cloud Atlas second
stage modular backdoor that we disclosed ﬁve years ago in our ﬁrst blogpost about them and
which remains unchanged.

Let’s meet PowerShower

PowerShower, named and previously disclosed by Palo Alto Networks in their blogspot (see
above), is a malicious piece of PowerShell designed to receive PowerShell and VBS modules to
execute on the local computer. This malware has been used since October 2018 by Cloud Atlas
as a validator and now as a second stage. The differences in the two versions reside mostly in
anti-forensics features for the validator version of PowerShower.

The PowerShower backdoor – even in its later developments – takes three commands:
Com‐
mand

Description

0x80
(Ascii
“P”)

It is the ﬁrst byte of the magic PK. The implant will save the received content as a ZIP ar‐
chive under %TEMP%\PG.zip.

0x79
(Ascii
“O”)

It is the ﬁrst byte of “On resume error”. The implant saves the received content as a VBS
script under “%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Word\[A-Za-z]{4}.vbs” and executes it by using
Wscript.exe

De‐
fault

If the ﬁrst byte doesn’t match 0x80 or 0x79, the content is saved as an XML ﬁle under
“%TEMP%\temp.xml”. After that, the script loads the content of the ﬁle, parses the XML to
get the PowerShell commands to execute, decodes them from Base64 and invokes IEX.
After executing the commands, the script deletes “%TEMP%\temp.xml” and sends the
content of “%TEMP%\pass.txt” to the C2 via an HTTP POST request.

A few modules deployed by PowerShower have been seen in the wild, such as:
A PowerShell document stealer module which uses 7zip (present in the received PG.zip) to
pack and exﬁltrate *.txt, *.pdf, *.xls or *.doc documents smaller than 5MB modiﬁed during
the last two days;
A reconnaissance module which retrieves a list of the active processes, the current user
and the current Windows domain. Interestingly, this feature is present in PowerShower but
the condition leading to the execution of that feature is never met in the recent versions of
PowerShower;
A password stealer module which uses the opensource tool LaZagne to retrieve passwords
from the infected system.
We haven’t yet seen a VBS module dropped by this implant, but we think that one of the VBS
scripts dropped by PowerShower is a dropper of the group’s second stage backdoor documented
in our article back in 2014.

And his new friend, VBShower

During its recent campaigns, Cloud Atlas used a new “polymorphic” infection chain relying no
more on PowerShower directly after infection, but executing a polymorphic HTA hosted on a
remote server, which is used to drop three different ﬁles on the local system.
A backdoor that we name VBShower which is polymorphic and replaces PowerShower as
a validator;
A tiny launcher for VBShower ;
A ﬁle computed by the HTA which contains contextual data such as the current user,
domain, computer name and a list of active processes.
This “polymorphic” infection chain allows the attacker to try to prevent IoC-based defence, as
each code is unique by victim so it can’t be searched via ﬁle hash on the host.

The VBShower backdoor has the same philosophy of the validator version of PowerShower. Its
aim is to complicate forensic analysis by trying to delete all the ﬁles contained in
“%APPDATA%\..\Local\Temporary Internet Files\Content.Word” and “%APPDATA%\..\Local
Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.Word\”.
Once these ﬁles have been deleted and its persistence is achieved in the registry, VBShower
sends the context ﬁle computed by the HTA to the remote server and tries to get via HTTP a VBS
script to execute from the remote server every hour.
At the time of writing, two VBS ﬁles have been seen pushed to the target computer by VBShower.
The ﬁrst one is an installer for PowerShower and the second one is an installer for the Cloud
Atlas second stage modular backdoor which communicates to a cloud storage service via
Webdav.

Cloud Atlas remains very proliﬁc in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The actor’s massive spearphishing campaigns continue to use its simple but effective methods in order to compromise its
targets.
Unlike many other intrusion sets, Cloud Atlas hasn’t chosen to use open source implants during
its recent campaigns, in order to be less discriminating. More interestingly, this intrusion set hasn’t
changed its modular backdoor, even ﬁve years after its discovery.
