Executive Summary
Microsoft released four out-of-band security updates on March 2, 2021 [1]. The usual reason for
releasing an out-of-band update is the appearance of active and widespread exploitation of a 0-day
vulnerability. In this case, these updates address 0-day vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange
Server products that allow threat actors to read sensitive information in emails, take control of the
target server, collect and exfiltrate data from the compromised server, and move laterally to other
systems in the network.
The threat group that exploits Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities is dubbed HAFNIUM by
Microsoft [2] and the attack campaign is named Operation Exchange Marauder by Volexity [3].
Although the HAFNIUM threat group primarily targets defense, higher education, and health sectors
in the United States, these zero-days affect unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers worldwide. For
example, The European Banking Authority (EBA) has announced that it has been the subject of a
cyber-attack against its Microsoft Exchange Servers [4]. As another example, an incident due to
these vulnerabilities is reported in Denmark [5].

1/17

In this article, we analyzed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) utilized by the HAFNIUM
threat actor to understand their attack methods and the impact of this breach. We also give
mitigation and detection suggestions and relevant IOCs for this cyber attack campaign.
Key Findings
Timeline: The attack campaign was detected first in January 2021 [3]. Microsoft released
updates on March 2, 2021, and Volexity and Microsoft published blog posts on the same day.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) announced the breach on March 7, 2021.
Prevalence: The attack campaign has the potential to affect thousands of public and private
organizations.
Attack Lifecycle: Attack starts with reconnaissance of vulnerable Exchange servers and
resumes with exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to exploit other vulnerabilities (CVE2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065). Then, the adversary uploads web shells
using these vulnerabilities and executes malicious commands with uploaded web shells. In
the post-exploitation phase, the adversary collects and exfiltrates data, dumps credentials,
and moves laterally.
Impact: Threat actors read sensitive information in mailboxes of users, compromise the victim
server, dump local credentials, add user accounts, dump Active Directory database
(NTDS.DIT), and move laterally to other systems in the network.
Exploitability: Exploits are available, and all of the vulnerabilities are being exploited by
adversaries. Exploits can be run remotely and do not require authentication.
Priority: Security teams must treat them with the highest priority.
Affected Versions: Microsoft Exchange 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010
Mitigation: Microsoft Exchange Servers must be patched as soon as possible.
Interim Mitigations: If you are unable to patch Exchange servers, implement IIS rewrite rules
provided by Microsoft and disable UM, ECP, VDir, and OAB VDir Services [6].
Detection: Scan Exchange server logs and paths for released IOCs. You can use
Sigma/QRadar/Splunk/Arcsight detection rules released by Picus.

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) utilized by HAFNIUM
HAFNIUM uses 11 of 14 tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. You can create an adversary
emulation plan using techniques and sub-techniques given below to validate your security controls
against the HAFNIUM threat group. Picus Threat database includes an APT adversary emulation
scenario for HAFNIUM along with 700+ other attack scenarios and 10000+ network and endpoint
attack emulations. Some actions of the HAFNIUM adversary emulation scenario in Picus is shown
below.

3/17

1. Reconnaissance
The Reconnaissance tactic of the MITRE ATT&CK framework includes techniques involving
adversaries to collect information actively and passively before compromising a victim [11].
Attackers use this information to use in other phases of the attack lifecycle, such as Initial Access
as used by HAFNIUM.
1.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1592.002 Gather Victim Host Information: Software
The HAFNIUM threat actor determines whether an Exchange server is running on the machine, and
if so, which version is running [1]. Adversaries collect information about installed software on a
victim machine, which may be used for targeting [12].

2. Resource Development
The Resource Development tactic includes techniques involving adversaries to create, purchase, or
compromise resources such as infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities [13]. They develop these
resources before compromising the victim and leverage them to utilize in other phases, such as
using leased Virtual Private Servers to support Command and Control.
2.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1583.003 Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server
HAFNIUM uses leased Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) in the United States to operate its threat
campaign [1]. Adversaries rent VPSs to make it difficult to bind operations back to them physically
[14]. They are also enabled to swiftly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure through
VPSs.
4/17

2.2 MITRE ATT&CK T1588.002 Obtain Capabilities: Tool
Adversaries obtain tools in cyberattacks to support their operations [15]. These tools can be free or
commercial, open or closed source. The HAFNIUM threat group uses the following tools to help its
post-compromise behaviors.
Tool

Description

Procdump

Procdump is a command-line utility that is a part of the Microsoft
Sysinternals suite. Although its primary purpose is monitoring an
application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps to determine the
cause of the spike, it can be used to dump the memory of a process [16].

Nishang

Nishang is a collection of scripts and payloads which using PowerShell
for penetration testing and red teaming. It can be categorized as a
PowerShell post-exploitation framework [17]. Copy-VSS PowerShell script
of Nishang can be used to copy the SAM file and dump credentials [16].
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are heavily using Nishang in
their operations [17].

PowerCat

PowerCat is an open-source PowerShell script that can read and write
data across network connections like the famous Netcat tool [18].

PsExec

PsExec is a legitimate Microsoft tool and a part of Windows Sysinternals
utilities [19]. PsExec can execute commands and binaries on remote
systems and download or upload a file over a network share. Attackers
like Nefilim and LockerGoga ransomware gangs utilize PsExec for lateral
movement [20] [21].

Covenant

Covenant is an open-source Command and Control (C2) framework
written in .NET [22].

SIMPLESEESHARP

SIMPLESEESHARP is a simple ASPX web shell used by the HAFNIUM to
write additional files to disk, such as the SPORTSBALL web shell [3].

SPORTSBALL

SPORTSBALL is a more extensive web shell used by HAFNIUM to upload
files or execute commands on the system [3].

China Chopper

China Chopper is a web shell that provides access back into the victim
system and is used by several threat groups [23].

ASPXSPY

ASPXSpy is a publicly available web shell used by several threat groups,
such as Threat Group 3390 [24].

7-Zip

HAFNIUM uses 7-Zip to compress data to be exfiltrated.

5/17

Winrar

HAFNIUM uses WinRar to compress data prior to exfiltration.

Exchange Snap-ins

HAFNIUM uses Exchange PowerShell snap-ins to export data in
mailboxes [2].

3. Initial Access
The Initial Access tactic includes techniques used by attackers to gain an initial foothold within a
network, such as exploiting vulnerabilities on public-facing web servers [25].
3.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application
Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in Internet-facing software, such as web servers, to gain access
to the host [26]. HAFNIUM exploits CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and
CVE-2021-27065 vulnerabilities in the Internet-facing and vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers
for initial access [2] [3].

4. Execution
4.1 T1059.003 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell
Web shells used by the HAFNIUM threat group, such as China Chopper [27], allow adversaries to
execute commands on the victim server using Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe), the primary
command prompt on Windows systems.
Enroll in the free “MITRE ATT&CK Windows Command Shell” course in Purple Academy to
learn how adversaries operate Windows Command Shell in their attacks and red and blue
team exercises.
Read our blog post about the Windows Command Shell (Command Line Interface) technique.

5. Persistence
The Persistence tactic consists of techniques used by adversaries to maintain their foothold across
system restarts, changed credentials, or patched vulnerabilities [28].
5.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1505.003 Server Software Component: Web Shell
Adversaries use web shells, web scripts placed on web servers, as backdoors to establish
persistency on the target server [29]. HAFNIUM utilize the following web shells as mentioned in the
“T1588.002 Obtain Capabilities: Tool” technique:
SIMPLESEESHARP
SPORTSBALL
China Chopper
ASPXSPY

6/17

5.2 MITRE ATT&CK T1136.002 Create Account: Domain Account
Adversaries, such as HAFNIUM, add new domain accounts and grant privileges to these accounts
to maintain access in the future [3].

6. Defense Evasion
Defense evasion consists of techniques that are used by adversaries to avoid detection by security
controls.
6.1 T1036.005 Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location
Adversaries may masquerade names/locations of their artifacts as identical or similar
names/locations of legitimate files to evade monitoring and detection [30]. HAFNIUM masquerade
names of deployed web shells as identical or similar names of legitimate files, such as log.aspx,
logout.aspx, default.aspx, errorPage.aspx, and server.aspx. You can find the list of used web shell
filenames in the Indicators of Compromise (IoC) list at the end of this article.
Enroll in the free and practical “MITRE ATT&CK Masquerading” course in Purple Academy to
learn all sub-techniques of this technique with red and blue team exercises:
Read our blog post about the Masquerading technique.

7. Credential Access
The Credential Access tactic includes techniques used by adversaries to steal account usernames
and passwords.
7.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1003.001 - OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory
There are many information sources targeted by attackers to dump credentials. As one of them,
The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) stores credentials of the logged-in users
in memory to provide seamless access to network resources without re-entering their credentials
[16]. Adversaries interact with the lsass.exe process and dump its memory to obtain credentials.
Several methods and tools can be utilized to dump credentials in memory. The HAFNIUM threat
actor uses Procdump to dump the LSASS process memory and gather credentials. An example
ProcDump command to dump credentials in this given below:
C:\temp>procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp

7.2 T1003.003 OS Credential Dumping: NTDS
HAFNIUM creates and steals copies of the NTDS.dit file using deployed web shells [3]. The
NTDS.dit file is the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) database that contains AD data,
including information about user objects, groups, and group membership. NTDS.dit database also
includes the password hashes for all users in the domain.

8. Lateral Movement
The Lateral Movement tactic includes techniques that are used by adversaries to access and
control remote systems (lateral movement) on the target network [31].
8.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1021.002 - Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares

Hafnium uses PsExec to move laterally through the target environment [3]. PsExec is a legitimate
Windows SysInternals tool used by attackers to run commands on the remote system by leveraging
network shares or valid accounts [32].

9. Collection
The Collection tactic consists of techniques used by adversaries to gather the information that is
relevant to their objectives.
9.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1560.001 - Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility
Adversaries may use several utilities such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, and WinZip to compress or encrypt
data before exfiltration [33]. Among these utilities, HAFNIUM uses WinRar and 7-Zip to compress
data to be exfiltrated.
9.2. MITRE ATT&CK T1114.002 - Email Collection: Remote Email Collection
Adversaries may access external-facing Exchange services to access emails and collect sensitive
information by leveraging valid accounts, access tokens, or remote exploits [34]. HAFNIUM adds
and uses Exchange PowerShell snap-ins to export data in mailboxes [2].

10. Command and Control
The Command and Control (C2) tactic consists of techniques used by adversaries to communicate
with compromised systems within a victim network [35].
10.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1071.001 - Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols
The HAFNIUM threat group communicates with deployed web shells using application-layer web
protocols (HTTP/HTTPS). Adversaries use these protocols for C2 to avoid detection and network
filtering [36].

11. Exfiltration
11.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1567.002 - Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage

8/17

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to cloud storage that allows upload, modify and retrieve files.
HAFNIUM exfiltrates collected data to cloud file sharing like MEGA.io [2].
Countermeasures by Picus
Built on technology alliances, Picus Mitigation Library delivers immediate value by providing
mitigation insights in Network Security, Endpoint Detection and Response, and Security Information
and Event Management categories. The Picus Threat Library includes most of the stolen tools in
this breach, and the Picus Mitigation Library contains actionable mitigation recommendations and
detection rules against them. Picus Labs’ Red Team and Blue Teams are working on the missing
tools and adding them and their techniques to our libraries.
So this means, Picus users have already assessed their cyber defense against most of the stolen
