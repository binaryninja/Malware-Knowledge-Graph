It was never a question of “if” but “when”. After five months of absence, the dreaded Emotet
has returned. Following several false alarms over the last few weeks, a spam campaign was
first spotted on July 13 showing signs of a likely comeback.
The Emotet botnets started pushing malspam actively on Friday, July 17, using the same
techniques as employed in its last wave of activity. Malicious emails contain either a URL or
an attachment that, once clicked on or opened, launches the Emotet payload. One familiar
technique is for the document to be sent as a reply within existing email threads.

The document contains a heavily obfuscated macro:

Once the macro is enabled, WMI launches PowerShell to retrieve the Emotet binary from
one of the remote compromised websites. It will iterate through a list until it identifies one that
is responding.

Once the payload is executed, it will send a confirmation back to one of Emotet’s command
and control servers.

Emotet has returned with new tricks
Emotet was by far the most visible and active threat on our radars in 2018 and 2019—right
up until the start of 2020, when it went into an extended break. One of the reasons why it
was (and is) so successful is because of its constant evolution in attack techniques and
threat partnerships.
For example, according to Bleeping Computer, Emotet now uses stolen email attachments to
add credibility to the spam it generates to infect targeted systems. This is in addition to the
aforementioned technique of hijacking email threads—a social engineering strategy
employed to increase the likelihood of infection.

Emotet is used by cybercriminals as the initial entry point for infecting an organization,
followed by a dwell time that can last days or weeks. In the meantime, it often drops
secondary payloads to further penetrate its target’s defenses. In its most recent incarnation,
Emotet has been observed dropping secondary payloads, such as TrickBot and QakBot to
spread laterally and steal credentials.
In fact, the real damage caused by an Emotet compromise happens when it forms alliances
with other malware gangs—particularly with those threat actors interested in dropping
ransomware, such as Ryuk, which was a constant partner of Emotet’s in 2019. So far, a
prevalent ransomware family has not yet been identified in Emotet’s latest campaign.

How to protect against Emotet
Users looking to protect against Emotet should first keep a wary eye out for phishing and/or
spam emails—especially any emails with attachments. Even emails that appear to be from
known contacts should be treated with suspicion.
However, if unlucky users happen to click on a malicious URL or open an infected document,
a good security program—especially one with anti-exploit technology—will block the malware
from launching and keep computers free from infection.

at our emergency kit, which includes a summary of the threat and a checklist of tips.
Malwarebytes Premium and business users are already protected against Emotet, thanks to
our signature-less anti-exploit technology.
