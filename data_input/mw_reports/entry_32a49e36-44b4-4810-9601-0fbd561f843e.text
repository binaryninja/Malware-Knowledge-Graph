Command and Control in the Fifth Domain
Command Five Pty Ltd
February 2012

ABSTRACT
This paper presents the findings of an extensive investigation into
command and control infrastructure used by an Advanced Persistent
Threat. Findings include technical details of malicious software, and
associated command and control protocols. These findings are drawn
upon to identify modus operandi and demonstrate links between a
number of major targeted attacks including the recent Sykipot attacks,
the July 2011 SK Communications hack, the March 2011 RSA breach,
and the series of coordinated cyber attacks dubbed NightDragon.

WARNING
This paper discusses malicious activity and identifies
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain names, and
websites that may contain malicious content. For
safety reasons these locations should not be accessed,
scanned, probed, or otherwise interacted with unless
their trustworthiness can be verified.
BACKGROUND
On 28 July 2011 SK Communications announced it
had been the subject of a hack which resulted in the
theft of the personal details of up to 35 million
people 1 . The attackers infected a number of SK
Communications computers with malicious software
(malware) and, by issuing command and control (C2)
instructions to the malware, were able to gain access
to, and exfiltrate large quantities of data. The attack
itself was complex, well planned and likely part of a
broader, concerted hacking effort attributable to an
Advanced Persistent Threat 2.

1 For details of the hack refer to the Command Five paper ‘SK Hack

by an Advanced Persistent Threat’. (Command Five Pty Ltd, 2011)

2 For a definition of the term ‘Advanced Persistent Threat’ refer to

the Command Five paper ‘Advanced Persistent Threats: A Decade
in Review’. (Command Five Pty Ltd, 2011)

The malware used in the attack was programmed
to communicate with several ‘callback’ domains. The
malware located its C2 server(s) by resolving these
domains into IP addresses using the ubiquitous
Domain Name System (DNS) 3 protocol. These
communications are depicted in Figure 1.

1. Using the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, the computer
asks a DNS server for directions to the callback domain.
2. The DNS server advises that the callback domain is located at IP
address x.x.x.x.
3. The malware communicates with the C2 server located at IP
address x.x.x.x to obtain C2 instructions and/or to send a
response.
4. The C2 server provides additional C2 instructions to the malware.

assistance to help computers communicate with other computers.
Its use is analogous to a person calling directory assistance to find
out what phone number to dial to speak to a certain person.

One of the callback locations used in the SK
Communications hack was ‘update.alyac.org’. The
domain was registered on 24 September 2010 using
registration information almost identical to that of a
legitimate company – a tactic used by the attacker on
several occasions4.
Following the intrusion into the SK
Communications network it became widely known
that the domain was being used for malicious
purposes, and perhaps for this reason, the one year
registration was not renewed by the attacker. Despite
this, a number of victims around the world continued
to use the domain to locate their C2 server, resulting
in attempted communications to a C2 server that no
longer exists.

THE ‘LURK’ COMMUNICATIONS
A single computer was observed communicating with
the callback domain ‘path.alyac.org’ on Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) 80 via the ‘LURK’ protocol.
The communications contained a 15­byte header
followed by data compressed using the DEFLATE 5
compression method. The header contained a
protocol identifier, size and compression information
as shown in Table 1.

THE VICTIMS
Computers using IP addresses allocated to France,
the People’s Republic of China, Portugal, South Korea,
Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States
are among those that attempted to communicate with
‘alyac.org’ subdomains after the attacker’s
registration lapsed in September 2011.
While some of these computers belong to
security researchers who deliberately installed
malware for research purposes, most are victims
compromised by the attacker either directly or
indirectly. The victims are from a variety of
industries including the technology sector, high
precision manufacturing, research and development,
testing and certification, global market research,
executive headhunting and mentoring, and
webhosting providers.
THE COMMUNICATIONS
Eight different types of C2 communications were
observed to ‘alyac.org’ subdomains from the
compromised computers. These communication
types will be referred to as ‘LURK’, ‘X­Shell C601’,
‘Update?’, ‘Murcy’, ‘Oscar’, ‘BB’, ‘DB’, and ‘Qdigit’
respectively. Several victims communicated via both
‘Update?’ and ‘Oscar’ which are believed to be
associated with the same malware. No other victims
were observed communicating with ‘alyac.org’
subdomains via more than one C2 protocol.

4 Other domains registered using a similar tactic include
‘bomuls.com’, ‘nprotects.org’, and ‘trendmicros.net’. (Command
Five Pty Ltd, 2011)

7 As described in Section 2.2 of RFC 1950, bits 0 to 3 in the first
byte of the ZLIB stream header represent the compression method
used, and bits 4 to 8 represent compression information. The
second byte in the header contains bits for an integrity check,
along with two additional flags. With a second byte of ‘9c’ the
integrity check passes (as 30876 is divisible by 31), the preset
dictionary flag is not set, and the compression level flag indicates
that the default algorithm was used for compression. (Deutsch,
ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification version 3.3, 1996)

LURK

Similar communications 9 are known to be
generated by malware that communicates with the
callback domain ‘office.windowupdate.org’ – a
domain that is linked to ‘alyac.org’ not only by the
communications protocol but also by both domain
registration tactic and infrastructure.

The domain ‘windowupdate.org’ previously
pointed to South Korean IP address 222.122.20.241­
an IP address to which ‘alyac.org’ also previously
pointed. This shared infrastructure further suggests
that the observed communications to ‘path.alyac.org’
and those to ‘office.windowupdate.org’ may be linked
to the same attacker.
The malware that generates the LURK
communications sent to ‘office.windowupdate.org’
was signed using a compromised code signing
certificate belonging to YNK Japan Inc – a producer of
online games. The same certificate has been used in a
number of attacks including by Hupigon malware 12
and malware similar to that used in the SK
Communications hack. Details of the compromised
code signing certificate are shown in Figure 2.

by the attacker with registration of ‘alyac.org’ 11.

The compromised code signing certificate was
revoked on 29 July 2011 but, as the malware was
signed on 3 July 2010 and the revocation was not
active for software signed before 29 July 2011 13, the
certificate continued to validate for this malware
after the revocation. (Fagerland, 2011)

The date of effect of the revocation has since
been backdated to prevent this malware’s certificate
from validating14. The new date of effect still may not
prevent the validation of all malware using this
compromised code signing certificate.

THE ‘X­SHELL C601’ COMMUNICATIONS
Numerous compromised computers communicated
with ‘path.alyac.org’ on TCP port 443 ­a port
commonly used for SSL. These communications,
however, were not SSL but instead unencrypted
communications likely generated by a version of the
command­line based ‘X­Shell 601’ Remote
Administration Tool (RAT) 15.
A summary of the observed X­Shell
communications, and the information they reveal
about the compromised computer, is shown in Table
3. The ‘C’ immediately preceding the ‘601’ in the
communications is believed to indicate that the
malware is not a free version but instead a custom, or
commercial, version of the X­Shell 601 RAT.

TABLE 3: X­SHELL C601 COMMUNICATION FORMAT
15 The X­Shell RAT is commercial software. (XTiger, Xdoors.net,
2011)
16 The SYSTEM_INFO structure contains information about a
computer such as its architecture, type of processor and number of
processors used. (Microsoft Corporation, 2011)
17 A locale is a collection of language­related user preference
information that typically identifies a user’s country and dialect.
(Microsoft Corporation, 2011)

In all observed communications the process
name listed at byte 288 was ‘svchost.exe’ 18. Based on
this, the malware has likely modified the system
registry on the compromised computers in such a
way that the RAT gets executed as a service by the
trusted process ‘svchost.exe’ each time the computer
is started. This process name, along with the callback
location, is configurable, and can be configured after
the RAT has been compiled into executable form.
While X­Shell supports numerous versions of the
Windows OS (including Windows XP, Vista, Windows
7, and Windows 2000, 2003 and 2008 server ­ both
32 and 64 bit versions), only computers running
Windows XP were observed communicating with
‘path.alyac.org’.
The functionality of the RAT depends on the
version, release number, plugins installed and the OS
on which the RAT is installed 19. Several versions of
the X­Shell RAT exist, including a free version and a
‘spy’ version20. The free version of the RAT is no
longer available for download from the XDoors
website, however, development of the software
continues21. Current release numbers of the X­Shell
RAT include 601 and 603. Previous releases date
back to at least 200622.
Some functionality comes standard in all
versions of the RAT including the ability to start a
command shell, control processes and services,
upload/download files, terminate TCP connections,
create user accounts, retrieve system information, log
user activity (via a keylogger) , modify timestamps on
files, conduct process injection, conduct denial of
service attacks and shutdown or restart the
computer. Commands supported by the X­Shell
software are listed in Annex C. (XTiger)

18 The process ‘svchost.exe’ is a generic host process for services
which run from DLLs. (Microsoft, A description of Svchost.exe in
Windows XP Professional Edition 2007)
19 Not all features are supported in each OS. For example, raw
socket sniffing is only supported in Windows 2000 and 2003.
(XTiger)
20 Versions of X­Shell include a ‘personal’ edition, a ‘mini’ version,
an ‘advanced’ version, a ‘spy’ version and an ‘enterprise’ version.
(XTiger ­ Crackersoftware, 2011)
21 Due to the author wanting to avoid “unnecessary trouble”, as of
16 March 2011, the free version of the X­Shell RAT (and also its
sister product the X­Door RAT) is no longer available for download
from the ‘xdoors.net’ webpage, however, an online forum
containing a list of changes made to the RAT continues to be
updated. (XTiger, forum.xdoors.net. Topic: X­Door/X­Shell free
download paused, 2011)
22 Previous releases of X­Shell include release numbers 323, 325,
327, 329, 331, 333, 335 and 337. (XTiger, 2010)

The RAT is Virtual Machine (VM) aware, proxy
aware and can also use a specified DNS server to
resolve callback domains. Some versions have rootkit
functionality and can avoid detection by antivirus
software. Third­party plugins can be developed and
integrated into the product.
Optional features include encrypted file search,
an SMS notification service, and functionality that
enables the compromised computer to be used as
part of a botnet to send spam or to conduct
distributed denial of service attacks. This broad range
of functionality makes the software fit for a number
of purposes and reflects the commercial nature of the
software. (XTiger)
The X­Shell RAT is generated by the X­Shell
Control Program ­ the same program from which the
malware is controlled. The control program can be
run in either Chinese language mode or English
language mode, and allows the malware to be easily
configured. It provides options to digitally sign the
malware,
specify
its
connection
mode
(connect/listen/sniff), install the malware in one of
several covert manners, recover the System Service
Dispatch Table (SSDT) 23 before installation, and abort
installation if a virtual machine is detected. (XTiger)
When X­Shell malware is generated, and the
‘connect’ connection mode 24 selected, the malware is
configured with a static C2 host (IP address or
callback domain) and control port. Additionally, an
option can be selected during the generation process
to actively notify the malware of a new C2 host and
port via a configuration webpage 25. If this option is
selected, the malware communicates with both a
configuration webpage, and a C2 server at regular
intervals. The interval for each can be separately
configured to a value of between 30 and 3600
seconds (inclusive). (XTiger)
The X­Shell RATs that communicated with the C2
host ‘path.alyac.org’ had been configured to use a 36
second interval. It is not known whether the malware
was configured solely with a static C2 host or

whether the malware also retrieves its C2 host and
port from a configuration webpage.
X­Shell Configuration Webpages
X­Shell configuration webpages contain, in encoded
form, a colon­separated IP address (or callback
domain) and port for the malware to use to
communicate with its C2 server. The encoded IP
address (or callback domain) and control port can be
decoded one byte at a time using the formula:
di = ei – ((i%8)+x),
where i is the byte index, di is the decoded byte, ei is
the encoded byte and x is a one byte key. This is the
equivalent of subtracting both the key and the byte
position number [0­7] from each byte. The position
number is modulo 8 i.e. repeats every 8 bytes.
For example, if the compromised computers
received a C2 host of ‘PATH.ALYAC.ORG’ and a
control port of 443 from a configuration webpage,
and a key of 0x16 (22 in decimal) was used to encode
the control information, the configuration webpage
would have contained the encoded string
‘fXlaH\hvWZFhlbVQJJ’.
THE ‘UPDATE?’ COMMUNICATIONS
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) POST ‘Update?’
requests were sent to both ‘path.alyac.org’ and
‘update.alyac.org’ from compromised computers.
Two request formats were observed; Variant A
(shown in Figure 3) in which the file path requested
was ‘/update?product=windows’, and Variant B
(shown in Figure 4) in which the file path requested
was ‘/update?id=number’, where number refers to an
eight digit hexadecimal number that changes
between requests. The domain ‘path.alyac.org’ only
received Variant B requests, while both variants were
sent to ‘update.alyac.org’.

23 The SSDT is often used by kernel mode rootkits to evade
detection.
24 In the ‘connect’ mode the malware attempts to communicate
with its C2 server, as opposed to the ‘listen’ mode in which it waits
for a C2 server to attempt to connect to it.
25 The configuration webpage is often named ‘xcip.asp’ and can be
generated and uploaded from within the control program. ‘Xcip’ is
presumably an acronym for ‘X­door Configure IP address’ or
something similar.

FIGURE 4: VARIANT B COMMUNICATIONS

The format of Variant A is identical to the
communications generated by the Destory RAT used
in the SK Communications hack 26. The format of
Variant B is identical to the communications
generated by malware that uses the callback domain
‘gm1.network­sec.net’27.
Both variants are associated with the Destory
RAT family of malware that dates back at least as far
as January 200728 and has been used in several major
targeted attacks.

26 For a detailed analysis of the Destory RAT used in the SK
Communications hack (including a complete list of deobfuscated
strings) refer to the Command Five paper ‘SK Hack by an Advanced
Persistent Threat’. (Command Five Pty Ltd, 2011)
27 Malware detected as ‘Troj_Inject.AMR’ submits HTTP POST
requests to ‘gm1.network­sec.net/update?id={value}’. The domain
‘gm1.network­sec.net’ is a known callback of malware detected as
Backdoor:Win32/Thoper.A. (Mendoza, 2011) (Wong, 2011)
28 The Destory RAT with MD5 hash ‘70CD C9A2 D9CC 276B C5D1
D47D 21FB 24DF‘ was compiled on 3 January 2007.

The Destory RAT family includes malware that is
detected as:
�
�
�

Backdoor.Sogu,
Backdoor:Win32/Thoper.A 29,
Trojan.Downloader:Win32/Thoper B 30.

The observed communications to the ‘alyac.org’
subdomains all occurred on TCP port 80, however, a
variety of ports (TCP ports 8080, 443, 12345 etc.)
have been used by this particular family of malware
for similar requests. The port used depends on how
the malware is configured.
Connection attempts from each of the
compromised computers occurred frequently while
the computers were powered on. For example, one
computer connected at 16 second intervals and
another approximately every 200 seconds (±15
seconds). Three HTTP POST requests were submitted
during each connection, each approximately one
second apart.
The following malformed user­agent31 is present
in the HTTP POST requests of both variants (spaces
shown here as ‘·’):
‘Mozilla/4.0·(compatible;·MSIE·6.0;·Windows·NT
·5.1;SV1;’
This user­agent is consistent with that which
may be generated by version 6.0 of the Microsoft
Internet Explorer web browser running on the
Microsoft Windows XP OS, except that it is missing a
closing bracket after the last semicolon and a space
after the second to last semicolon. This malformed
user­agent is hardcoded into the malware and can be
used as a signature to detect the communications.
Four custom headers are also present in the
HTTP requests: ‘X­Session’, ‘X­Status’, ‘X­Size’, and ‘X­
Sn’. For some malware in the Destory RAT family not
all of these headers will be present.

29 The Destory RAT with MD5 hash ‘5FCE 1FC1 8283 D76C 396A
3CCC 64BD BBDE’ is detected by antivirus software as both
Backdoor.Sogu and Backdoor:Win32/Thoper.A. This malicious file
is identical to that used in the SK Communications hack except for
its configuration. (Hispasec Sistemas, 2011)
30 The Destory RAT with MD5 hash ‘7543 64D9 DB70 2DC7 1532
7B40 BF97 E556’ is detected by antivirus software as both
Backdoor.Sogu
and
TrojanDownloader:Win32/Thoper.B.
(Hispasec Sistemas, 2011)
31 User­agents are used in HTTP communications to tell
webservers which OS and web browser their clients are using, so
they can serve compatible webpages.

Cookie Stealing
Cookies were sent with the HTTP POST requests from
all but three IP addresses. A cookie named ‘VistorID’
was present any time a cookie was sent. On occasion
a ‘Yahoo’, ‘SessionId’ and/or ‘fcVal’ cookie was also
present in the requests. The transmission of these
cookies could facilitate session stealing and, in the
case of the Yahoo cookie, enable unauthorised
webmail access.
Each VisitorID cookie contained an expiry time
between 9/25/2014 5:50:03 AM and 9/25/2014
6:14:17 AM. The expiry time is unique for each victim
and remained constant (per victim) across the HTTP
POST requests. It is possible the victims received the
cookie from a C2 server with which they had
previously communicated, or, from a server hosting a
webpage that caused the initial infection. It is also
possible that the cookie, and the propinquity of the
times in the cookies, is coincidental, and that the
victims received the cookie from other locations.
THE ‘MURCY’ COMMUNICATIONS
Multiple Chinese IP addresses were observed
submitting HTTP GET requests to the host
‘path.alyac.org’. Data contained
within the
communications indicated that the requests were all
sent from a single computer, and therefore that
computer was not using a static IP address.
The data from the computer was carried in the
requests in an encoded form (as described below)
within a HTTP header named ‘Extra­Data’. Two other
unique headers were also present in the requests;
‘Extra­Data­Bind’ and ‘Extra­Data­Space’. The
communications appear to be generated by malware
known as ‘Backdoor.Murcy’ that is reportedly not in

FIGURE 5: SAMPLE OF MURCY COMMUNICATIONS

The path in the HTTP GET requests is the
computer’s tick count (i.e. the number of milliseconds
since the system was started). The requests from the
victim occurred approximately every 11 seconds
when the computer was turned on. Accordingly, the
number in the URI increased by approximately 11000
each request. Where there was a break in the
communications (presumably due to the computer
being shut down or rebooted), the counter reset and
was between 128703 and 133243 in the next
communication. This indicates that the malware
began communicating from this compromised
computer within minutes of the computer being
booted.
The encoded data within the ‘Extra­Data’ header
can be decoded using the standard Base64 alphabet
but with modified bit placement. The standard
Base64 algorithm decodes encoded strings using
consecutive bits read left to right i.e. bits 0­7 would
form the first decoded byte (shown in Figure 6). For
Murcy communications, the input bits that form each
output byte are not taken contiguously. Figure 7
describes how the first three decoded bytes are
constructed, and can be used to implement a
decoding algorithm.

32 Symantec Corporation assesses the number of Backdoor.Murcy
infections to be less than 50. (Ward, 2011)

For some input data sizes a crude, but
functionally equivalent, approach is to reverse the
input bytes, apply a standard Base64 decoding, and
then reverse the output bytes.
IP2B Protocol
The decoded string contains communications of a
format hereon referred to as the ‘IP2B’ protocol. All
observed IP2B communications began with a 16 byte
header containing the hexadecimal values
0x12345678 and 0x10001000, and the size of the
data. The decoded version of the Murcy ‘Extra­Data’
string from Figure 5 is shown in Figure 8.

The data sent to the C2 server is dependent on
the C2 instructions received. Commands the Murcy
malware reportedly understands are shown in Annex
D. (SafeZoneCast, 2011)
The Murcy malware is commonly named
‘cydll.dll’, creates a mutual exclusion (mutex 35 )
handle named ‘Cy1.0Mutex’, and installs a service
named ‘CyService’ with a display name of ‘CyService
Service’. It also commonly gains persistence by
creating
the

discovered
Backdoor.Murcy on 31 July 2011, yet the same
malware appears to have been first detected by
Kaspersky Lab on 11 January 2010 36 . Malware
samples with the same attributes date back to at least
October 2009 37 . This suggests that the Murcy
malware has been in use for at least two years.
Known Murcy malware uses the callback
38
,
domains
‘albertstein.ddns.us’
‘alvington.jetos.com’39, ‘ftp.xmahone.ocry.com’40, and
‘superaround.ns02.biz’ 41 . These callback domains
were all also reportedly used in the March 2011
intrusion into RSA’s network. That intrusion resulted
in the theft of information related to RSA’s SecurID
two­factor authentication products. The stolen
information was later used to enable targeting of
defence contractors. (Coviello, 2011). (Rasmussen,
2011) (US­CERT, 2011).

THE ‘OSCAR’ PROTOCOL
Numerous computers were observed communicating
with an ‘alyac.org’ subdomain on TCP port 80 via the
‘Oscar’ protocol. Most, but not all, of the computers
also communicated to the same domain via the
‘Update?’ communications. The protocol is believed
to be associated with the same malware that
produces the ‘Update?’ communications – the Destory
RAT.
Each compromised computer communicated at a
different interval to the others, and accordingly, the
malware on each of the compromised computers
appears to have been individually configured. For
example, one computer communicated every 12
seconds and another every 16 seconds.
Encrypted data was sent during each
communication. The length of the encrypted data in
each packet varied between 16 bytes and 89 bytes.
After sending the encrypted data the malware waited
for a response.
THE ‘BB’ PROTOCOL
Two computers were observed communicating with
‘update.alyac.org’ via the ‘BB’ protocol. One of the
computers used a Chinese IP address, the other a
South Korean IP address. The ‘BB’ protocol has a 21
byte header containing a 4 byte XOR key that can be
used to decode the remaining bytes in the packet. The
packet format is described in Table 5.

35 A mutex is a technical construct used to control access to system

resources. In this case the technical meaning is less significant than
the fact that the mutex in the Murcy malware is uniquely named.
36 Malware that fits the profile of Murcy malware was detected on
11 January 2010 as ‘Backdoor.Win32.Agent.anvj’. (Kaspersky Lab

After sending the basic beacon, the compromised
computers waited for a response from the server,
then closed the connection when they had not
received a response from the server within five
seconds.
Both of the compromised computers reattempted
the communications approximately every eight
seconds. On some days the high frequency of the
beacon activity resulted in over 10000 connection
attempts per victim in a 24 hour period.
THE ‘DB’ PROTOCOL
A single computer was observed communicating with
the domain ‘update.alyac.org’ via the ‘DB’ protocol.
The communications originated from the same
Chinese computer network as one of the ‘BB’ victims
but from a different computer on that network. It is
not known what malware generates the ‘DB’
communications, or whether it is the same malware
that generates the ‘BB’ communications.
The communications reveal detailed OS and
system information about the compromised
computer as shown in Table 6. The OS information
reveals that the compromised computer is running
Windows 2003 Server Service Pack 2. The detailed
system information reveals that the compromised
computer has an Intel Pentium Pro­class processor,
four logical processors and an LGA 775 42 Central

TABLE 6: SUMMARY OF FIRST 202 BYTES OF A ‘DB’
PACKET

The DB communications typically occurred at
intervals of between 4 and 92 seconds, however,
sometimes they were much further apart. After
sending the detailed beacon to the command and
control server, the compromised computer appeared
to expect a response from the server.
The combined processor level and processor revision
information indicates the computer has an LGA 775 CPU socket
(Intel family 6/ model 15/ stepping 11). (Microsoft Corporation,
2011) (Wikipedia)
43 On several occasions the 4 bytes ‘70 17 00 00’ were prepended
to the communications.
42

THE ‘QDIGIT’ PROTOCOL
One computer using a static South Korean IP address
was observed sending the five bytes 0x51 0x31 0x39
0x21 0x00 (“\x51Q19!”) to ‘update.alyac.org’ on TCP
port 80 up to nearly 800 times a day. While the
communications did not occur continuously (likely
due to the computer being turned off), when they did
occur a new connection was attempted, and the
packet containing ‘Q19!’ sent, approximately every
minute.
It is assumed these communications are
generated by malware but it is not known what
malware, or which other callback domains that
malware uses. The malware appeared to expect a
response from the server after it sent each packet.
FREQUENCY OF COMMUNICATIONS
The communications to ‘alyac.org’ subdomains
occurred frequently from each compromised
computer. A summary of typical observed intervals
between communications, broken down by protocol,
is shown in Table 7.

and the BB victims at 8 second intervals. The
beaconing interval of the other victims does not
appear to be a fixed time, and instead a degree of
randomness appears to be employed.

Ports used

ASSOCIATION WITH MALWARE AND ATTACKS

As shown in Table 8, the observed communications
all occurred on TCP port 80 or TCP port 443 ­ ports
commonly used for legitimate purposes 44.

The observed communications have links to a variety
of malware and to a number of attacks, as illustrated
in Figure 9, and detailed below.

The ‘Update?’ communications and the Oscar
communications are both associated with the Destory
RAT family of malware. This malware family has been
used in a number of targeted attacks including the
July 2011 SK Communications hack. Through shared
infrastructure the malware has links to the series of
coordinated, covert and targeted cyber attacks
dubbed ‘NightDragon’45, and also to the recent series
of targeted attacks that have used ‘Sykipot’ 46
malware.

TABLE 8: COMMUNICATION PORTS USED

NAME SERVERS
While most malware uses the local DNS server
settings of the compromised computer to resolve its
callback domain to an IP address, in some observed
communications the attackers appear to have
specifically chosen the DNS servers.
The majority of X­Shell C601 malware that called
back to ‘path.alyac.org’ used Google DNS servers,
presumably instead of the DNS settings on the
compromised computers. The X­Shell C601 malware
supports use of a specified DNS server to resolve
callback domains, and it appears the attackers have
made use of this functionality.
The ‘Update?’, Oscar, Murcy and Qdigit victims all
appear to have used their local DNS server settings to
resolve the callback domains. On the other hand, the
single LURK victim used Google DNS servers to
resolve its callback domain, as did the Chinese BB
victim (and associated DB victim) but not the South
Korean BB victim. This suggests that the LURK, BB
and DB malware may also have the same DNS
functionality as X­Shell, although it is possible that
the victims are configured to use the Google servers
as their regular DNS servers, and that the malware is
not using different servers.

44 TCP ports 80 and 443 are commonly used for legitimate HTTP
and HTTPS activity respectively, and as such communications to
these ports are often allowed through firewalls.

Through a shared callback domain the Destory
RAT malware also has links to socially engineered
emails including those that targeted experts on the
relationship of the United States with Japan, China
and Taiwan. The Destory RAT is also connected to
LURK malware via a compromised code signing
certificate which was used to sign both pieces of
malware, and to IP2B communications by a shared
callback domain.
The X­Shell RAT has been used in numerous
attacks but many of these attacks are not expected to
be associated with the same attackers. On the other
hand, the callback domains used by Murcy malware
suggest that the malware is used, perhaps solely, by
the attackers responsible for the March 2011 RSA
breach.
IP addresses, to which ‘alyac.org’ and its
subdomains previously pointed, associate the
domain, and the attackers behind it, with a raft of
activity. This includes activity involving callback
domains registered to appear as though they were
associated with legitimate, trusted entities, and
domains registered to a ‘Lee Cooper’ that tie back to
the SK Communications hack.

45 The NightDragon series of attacks began in, or prior to,
November 2009 and targeted global oil and petrochemical
companies. (McAfee Foundation Professional Services and McAfee
Labs, 2011)
46 Sykipot is a family of malware used since 2007 to steal
intellectual property. The malware has been used in a series of
socially engineered email campaigns against a variety of sectors.
On a number of occasions, the attackers have exploited zero day
vulnerabilities to install the malware. Some variants of the
malware include features that enable it to hijack smartcards.

NightDragon
Destory RAT malware is known to communicate with
the callback domain ‘vupdate.mail­kr2.com’47, while
NightDragon malware is known to communicate with
‘ma2.mail­kr2.com’ 48 and ‘www2.mail­kr2.com’ 49 .
The communications sent to ‘www2.mail­kr2.com’
are similar 50 , but not identical, to IP2B
communications, further linking the observed
activity. Other ‘mail­kr2.com’ subdomains include
‘cb85.mail­kr.com’,
‘sa****.mail­kr2.com’,
and
‘skylie.mail­kr2.com’ ­ at least two of which are
known to be associated with malware 51.
Destory RAT malware is known to use the
callback domain ‘bbs.afbjz.com’ 52 , while known
NightDragon malware uses the callback domain
‘blog.afbjz.com’53. As of 3 February 2012, both of the
subdomains point to US IP address 67.90.204.228.
This overlap in infrastructure appears to be of
particular significance given the following links
between other activity on the same IP address.
As of 6 February 2012, the domains ‘gmail.mail­

‘live.mail­ru2.com’,
‘mail­ru2.com’,
‘msn.mail­ru2.com’,
‘usaisbig.oerco.com’,
‘whois.oerco.com’,

and
‘www2.oerco.com’ also point to IP address
67.90.204.228. At least one of these domains is
otherwise known to be associated with malware 54.
47 The Destory RAT with MD5 hash ‘9555 8985 D211 F768 1ACC
1AC9 2DCB 07C8 A096 B403’ uses the callback location
‘vupdate.mail­kr2.com’.
48 Malware with MD5 hash ‘2D8A 9038 E151 FB30 D45E A866
8AFD 2A8E’, known to call back to ‘ma2.mail­kr2.com’, is detected
by antivirus software as ‘TrojanDropper:Win32.RedSip.A’, an alias
for NightDragon malware. (ThreatExpert Ltd., 2010) (Hispasec
Sistemas, 2011) (Kurc, 2011)
49 Malware with MD5 hash ‘5BC5 97E4 8270 F04E C9B6 8343
2432 E352’, known to call back to ‘www2.mail­kr2.com’, is
detected by antivirus software as ‘Backdoor:Win32/RedSip.A!svc’,
an alias for NightDragon malware. (Sunbelt Security, 2010)
(Hispasec Sistemas, 2010)
50 Both communications begin with a 16 byte header containing the
protocol identifier ‘0x12345678’ and a data size, and the data in
both contains similar system information but in a different order.
51 Malicious files are separately known to attempt communications
with ‘sa*****.mail­kr2.com’ on TCP port 8000, and ‘cb85.mail­
kr2.com’ on TCP port 6543. (Doctor Web, 2011) (Sunbelt Security,
2011)
52 The domain ‘bbs.afbjz.com’ is a known callback domain of
Destory RAT malware that is detected by antivirus software as
both Backdoor:Win32/Thoper.A and Backdoor.Sogu. (Wong, 2011)
(Mullaney, 2011)
53 The domain ‘blog.afbjz.com’ is a known callback domain of
NightDragon malware that is detected by antivirus software as
‘Trojan.Dropper:Win32/Redsip.A’. (Kurc, 2011)
54 Malware
that is detected by antivirus software as
‘Trojan.DownLoader4.8565’
communicates
with
us****ig.oerco.com on TCP port 100. (Dr. Web, 2011)

The ‘oerco.com’ domain is registered to the same
person as ‘afbjz.com’55, associating the two domains
with a single entity. The ‘mail­ru2.com’ domain
appears to be associated with the same entity as the
‘mail­kr2.com’ domain used by NightDragon malware
and the Destroy RAT (as described above). While the
domains were registered using different details, they
were registered on the same day through the same
domain name registrar, and the records later updated
minutes apart56. This suggests that all C2 activity
involving IP address 67.90.204.228 may be
associated with a single entity.
The recently expired domain ‘todaygonever.com’
also previously pointed to the same IP address. As
will
be
discussed
later
in
the
paper,
‘todaygonever.com’ is directly associated with
malware and has links to the recent series of Sykipot
attacks.
The
recently
expired
domains
‘goodfeelingauto.com’ and ‘deadlinely.com’ also
pointed to the same IP address and were likely
associated with the same attackers.
Socially Engineered Emails
Other Destory RAT callback domains are also
otherwise linked to malicious activity. For example,
the callback domain 'www.adv138mail.com' 57 was
used by a Poison Ivy RAT58 sent in a July 2011
socially engineered email campaign. The emails
contained
an
attachment,
named
‘Meeting
Agenda.pdf’, which attempted to exploit a
vulnerability
specified
by
the
Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) number 2010­
288359 to install the Poison Ivy RAT. A clean decoy
PDF file was shown to the user when the attachment
was opened. A copy of the text used in the socially
engineered email campaign is shown in Figure 10 60.

55 Both domains are registered to a person whose contact email
address is ‘madconnon@126.com’. The name and address details
are identical for both domain registrations.
56 The domain ‘mail­kr2.com’ was last modified on 24 February
2012 at 1:40:32, while the domain ‘mail­ru2.com’ was last
modified on the same day at 1:43:53. Both domains were
registered through 35 Technology Co., Ltd on 8 March 2010.
57 The domain ‘www.adv138mail.com’ is listed as a Backdoor.Sogu
callback. (Mullaney, 2011)
58 The Poison Ivy RAT is an advanced remote administration tool
for Windows. Both free and paid versions of the RAT are available.
(shapeless n.d.)
59 CVE 2010­2883 refers to a particular vulnerability in certain
versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat which an attacker can use to
take control of affected Windows, Macintosh and UNIX systems.

Additional Destory RAT Links
FIGURE 10: TEXT OF A SOCIALLY ENGINEERED
EMAIL ASSOCIATED WITH WWW.ADV138MAIL.COM

The domain ‘www.adv138mail.com’ is also
associated with malware detected by antivirus
software as ‘Backdoor.Win32.Delf.abow’ 61 . Other
known subdomains include:
�
�
�
�
�

‘asm.adv138mail.com’,
‘dns.adv138mail.com’,
‘ftp.adv138mail.com’,
‘ihi.adv138mail.com’62,
‘nov.adv138mail.com’.

These domains (with the possible exception of
the ‘dns’ and ‘ihi’ subdomains) have all pointed to the
same infrastructure 63 as the domains ‘pu.flower­
show.org’ and ‘www.mailsignin.net’. That shared
infrastructure is known to have been used to send
socially engineered emails that contained an
attachment named ‘invtation.pdf’ [sic]. Similar to the
‘Meeting Agenda’ attachment, ‘invtation’ installs a
Poison Ivy RAT, but one configured to communicate
with the callback domain ‘pu.flower­show.org’ 64. The
text used in the emails is shown in Figure 11 65.
61 The malware with MD5 hash ‘F0B8 48A8 41D4 EF34 06A6 F9C4
766C 540B’ modifies the ‘hosts’ file on computers it is run on so
that the file contains an entry for ‘www.adv138mail.com’.
(ThreatExpert Ltd., 2011)
62
The domain ‘ihi.adv138mail.com’ is listed as a
Backdoor:Win32/Thoper.A callback location. (Wong, 2011)
63 The domains previously pointed to a C2 server located at IP
address 112.121.171.94.
64 The socially engineered email that communicated back to
‘pu.flower­show.org’ was sent from IP address 112.121.171.94 –
the same IP address to which the callback domain pointed.
65 Email courtesy of Mila Parkour of ‘contagiodump.blogspot.com’.
(Parkour, contagio: Jul 5 CVE­2010­2883 PDF invitation.pdf with
Poison Ivy from 112.121.171.94 | pu.flower­show.org, 2011)

In addition to having previously shared
infrastructure with the known Destory RAT callback
domain
‘www.adv138mail.com’,
the
domain
‘www.mailsignin.net’ has also previously shared
infrastructure with at least two other known Destory
RAT
callback
domains.
The
domain
‘www.mailsignin.net’ previously pointed to IP
address 175.45.22.220, as did the known Destory
RAT callback domains ‘newhose.ntimobile.com’ and
‘sms.servegame.com’66. A number of subdomains of
the Destory RAT­associated domain ‘join3com.com’
also previously pointed to the same IP address 67.
These links suggest that many attacks in which
the Destory RAT has been used are linked, not only
by the malware, but also through C2 infrastructure.
This further supports the notion that the Destory
RAT was developed by, or for, particular attackers
and that most, if not all, of the malicious activity
involving it is attributable to those attackers.
The Destory callback domains also have links to
additional malware. For example, the domain
‘network­sec.net’ has been used by the Destory RAT
(‘gm1.network­sec.net’), by Poison Ivy malware
(‘yoyo.network­sec.net’ 68 ) and by ‘Backdoor­FCQ’
66 The domains ‘newhose.ntimobile.com’ and ‘sms.servegame.com’
are listed as known callbacks for Backdoor.Sogu and Thoper.A
respectively. (Wong, 2011) (Mullaney, 2011)
67
The
‘join3com.com’
subdomains
‘123.join3com.com’,
‘dow.join3com.com’, ‘ftp.join3com.com’, and ‘ico.join3com.com’ are
all known to have pointed to IP address 175.45.22.220. The
domain ‘catalog.join3com.com’ is listed as a known
Backdoor:Win32/Thoper.A callback location. (Wong, 2011)
68 The domain ‘yoyo.network­sec.net’ is used by malware with
MD5 hash ‘3703 7F67 4BCB BB7E EF38 89AB 6EB3 0268’. (Threat
Expert Ltd., 2008)

sec.net’ and ‘psbm10.network­sec.net’69).

between the Destory
communications.

Compromised Code Signing Certificate

Several other ‘travlman.com’ sub­domains are
known to exist 77 including at least one that is
associated with malware. The sub­domain
‘dm.travlman.com’78 is the callback used by malware
detected
by
antivirus
software
as
‘Trojan:Win32/Boupke’79.

The observed LURK communications appear to be the
same as those generated by malware that was
digitally signed using a compromised code signing
certificate that was used to sign a Destory RAT, and
other malware used in several attacks 70 . That
malware
communicates
with
the
domain
‘office.windowupdate.org’ – a domain that is linked to
‘alyac.org’ not only by the communications protocol
but also by both domain registration tactic and
infrastructure71. (Fagerland, 2011)
Travlman Links
The Destory RAT malware used in the SK
Communications hack 72 is identical, except for its
configuration, to malware73 that communicates with
the callback domain ‘wow.travlman.com’. The
callback domain previously pointed to the same IP
address as that used in the SK Communications
hack74. Both of the malicious files were compiled
from the same code on 27 September 2010 at
09:17:04 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) 75, and later
configured.
The callback domain ‘wow.travlman.com’ is also
used by malware 76 that produces ‘IP2B’
communications of an identical format to those
decoded from the ‘Extra­Data’ in the Murcy
communications. This highlights an additional link
uses several ‘network­sec.net‘ subdomains as
callback locations. (McAfee Inc., 2011)
70 The first reported abuse of the certificate was in relation to the
Hupigon trojan with MD5 hash ‘8800 8398 71A3 3801 B2B4 6F9E
23B7 B7A5’. (Hispasec Sistemas, 2011) (Common Computer
Security Standards)
71 Refer to the ‘LURK Communications’ section for additional
information.
72 The Destory RAT used in the SK Communications hack was
hosted on a toolbox as ‘nateon.exe’, and called back to
‘nateon.duamlive.com’. It has a SHA1 hash of ‘F84C D73D ABF1
8660 7F98 6DF9 8C54 02A5 7BB5 8AD1’ and MD5 of ‘4618 84F1
D41E 9E07 09B4 0AB2 CE5A FCA7’. (Command Five Pty Ltd, 2011)
73 Malware with the MD5 hash ‘5FCE 1FC1 8283 D76C 396A 3CCC
64BD BBDE’ calls back to ‘wow.travlman.com’.
74 Both ‘wow.travlman.com’ and ‘duamlive.com’ previously pointed
to IP address 203.160.67.131. (rbls, shenqi.travlman.com is not
listed in any blacklists, 2011) (DomainTools, LLC)
75 Automated analysis reports confirm the compilation time of the
code and that, while the MD5 hash of each of the files is different,
the MD5 hashes of each of the code sections, except for the .data
section, are identical. (Hispasec Sistemas, 2011) (Hispasec
Sistemas, 2011)

RAT

and

the

IP2B

Link to RSA Breach
The majority of the known callback domains for
Murcy malware were used in the March 2011 RSA
breach. This suggests that the attackers responsible
for the RSA breach also use the Murcy malware.
Given that the malware is reportedly not in
widespread use, the Chinese server communicating
with ‘path.alyac.org’ may have been compromised by
the same attackers responsible for the RSA breach.
X­Shell RAT
The X­Shell RAT is commercially available software
that appears to have been used in a number of
attacks. There are numerous versions of the X­Shell
RAT, and not all produce the same communications.
Malware that generates the same X­Shell C601
communications 80 observed to ‘path.alyac.org’
appears to have been used in a number of attacks.
Malware that generates similar communications also
appears to have been used in a number of attacks 81.
That malware is thought to be an X­Shell C603 RAT
and not an X­Shell C601 RAT. It is not known whether
any of these malicious files were used by the same

69 Backdoor­FCQ

The following are known ‘travlman.com’ subdomains;
‘dm.travlman.com’,
‘g.travlman.com’,
‘g1.travlman.com’,
‘g2.travlman.com’, ‘luandao.travlman.com’, ‘mail.travlman.com’,
‘seo.travlman.com’, ‘shenqi.travlman.com’, ‘wayi.travlman.com’,
and ‘www.travlman.com’.

is
known
to

79 Malware with MD5 hash ‘70A8 8091 E1F9 A7BE E246 488C
CE79 936A’ is detected by antivirus software as
‘Trojan.Win32.Boupke!IK’, ‘Trojan:Win32/Boupke.gen!A’, and
‘Trojan.Win32.Boupke’. (Hispasec Sistemas, 2009)

attackers who used the X­shell malware which
communicates with ‘path.alyac.org’.
Shared Alyac Infrastructure
The domain ‘alyac.org’ previously pointed to a C2
server located at IP address 222.122.20.241 and
another located at IP address 202.30.224.240. These
IP addresses are associated with a number of other
callback domains including ‘bbs.ezxsoft.com’,
‘pc.nprotects.org’, and ‘wow.travlman.com’ ­ the
latter being linked to both the Destory RAT and IP2B
communications (as previously discussed) 82.
In addition to both having shared infrastructure
with ‘alyac.org’, the two callback domains
‘bbs.ezxsoft.com’ and ‘pc.nprotects.org’ are used by
malware that creates a uniquely named directory 83.
This indicates a direct relationship between the two
pieces of malware.
The domain ‘ezxsoft.com’ was registered by the
same entity (‘Lee Cooper’) as a domain used in the SK
Communications hack (‘ro.diggfunny.com’), further
linking it to the same attackers. The C2 server and the
callback domains also have links to a myriad of other
malicious activity84.
Sykipot Activity
As previously discussed, before it expired,
‘todaygonever.com’ pointed to a C2 server associated
with both the Destroy RAT and NightDragon
malware. The same domain is also associated with
Sykipot activity through shared C2 server
infrastructure, and domain registration information.
Over its lifetime the domain ‘todaygonever.com’
pointed to numerous IP addresses, many of which are
not noteworthy as they were assigned to servers that
hosted numerous websites. Four of the IP addresses,
however, are of particular note – IP addresses
67.90.204.228
(as
previously
discussed),
67.79.149.90, 209.133.72.83 and an IP address
allocated to a large US financial institution.

82 Malware detected as 'Trojan.Win32.AgentBypass' uses the
callback domain 'bbs.ezxsoft.com'. Malware detected as
‘Trojan.Win32.Generic’ uses the callback domain ‘pc.nprotects.org’.
(GFI SandBox 2011) (GFI SandBox 2011)
83 Both
pieces of malware create a directory named
‘03a075fb70d5d675f9dc26fc’ and a subdirectory named ‘update’.
(GFI SandBox 2011) (GFI SandBox 2011)
84 For further details of the links, refer to the paper ‘SK Hack by an
Advanced Persistent Threat’. (Command Five Pty Ltd, 2011)

IP address 67.79.149.90 previously hosted the
known Sykipot domain ‘help.newcarstyle.com’. Both
IP address 67.79.149.90 and IP address
209.133.72.83 previously hosted ‘bluelightness.com’
subdomains85. They therefore have additional links to
Sykipot activity as ‘shopping.bluelightness.com’ was
previously hosted on IP address 209.53.155.244 ­ the
same IP address as the known Sykipot domains
‘www.topix21century.com’
and
‘notes.topix21century.com’ 86. The ‘bluelightness.com’
domain is also linked to ‘mail­kr2.com’ ­ a Destory
RAT and NightDragon domain previously discussed.
Both domains share infrastructure with the domain
‘worldsecuritys.com’87.
As
of
6
February,
the
domains
‘file.filesdelete.com’, ‘news.welldone123.net’ and
‘well.welldone123.net’ all point to the IP address
allocated to the large US financial institution (to
which ‘todaygonever.com’ also previously pointed.)
The domain ‘welldone123.net’ is a known Sykipot
callback domain88. The domain ‘filesdelete.com’ is
also otherwise associated with malware 89.
The email address listed in the domain
registration
for
‘todaygonever.com’
was
‘janagreen2000@gmail.com’. The same contact email
address (but different name, address, and phone and
fax numbers) was also used in the domain
registration for ‘centurycpc.com’, ‘filesdelete.com’,
‘greenrightway.com’,
‘quicklyfindme.com’,
and
‘newcarstyle.com’ – at least two of which are known
Sykipot malware domains 90.

previously
hosted

‘www.topix21century.com’. The webpage ‘topix21century.com’
was used, in what is believed to have been a targeted attack, to
install Sykipot malware on computers which visited the webpage.
The installed malware then communicated with a C2 server
located at ‘notes.topix21century.com’. (Symantec Corporation,
2010) (MalwareGroup.com)
87 In 2011 both the known callback domain ‘cb85.mail­kr2.com’
and ‘test.worldsecuritys.com’ pointed to IP address 12.68.249.62,
the later still points there as of 9 February 2012. In 2011,
‘bluelightness.com’ and ‘worldsecuritys.com’ both pointed to IP
address 68.178.232.100, the later still points there as of 9 February
2012.
88 The domain ‘welldone123.net’ is known to be associated with
the Sykipot series of attacks. (Symantec Corporation, 2012)
89 The
domain ‘www.filesdelete.com’ is associated with
‘Troj/Bdoor­BDM’. (Sophos Ltd., 2012)
90 The domain ‘help.newcarstyle.com’ is a known Sykipot callback,
as is ‘greenrightway.com’. (Symantec Corporation, 2012) (Malware

INSIGHTS
�

�

�

�

�

Increasingly, instead of malware using the
default DNS servers on a compromised
computer to resolve its callback domains to
IP addresses, attackers will specify DNS
servers for the malware to use. This has
significant implications for network
defenders. Such requests, if allowed, will
bypass the victim’s DNS servers and defeat
any blacklists used by the victim’s own DNS
servers. Furthermore, the requests will not
appear in the victim’s DNS server logs,
making detection and investigation more
difficult.
Organisations should consider blocking
internal DNS traffic to all locations other
than the company’s own DNS servers.
Furthermore they should be alert to any DNS
communication attempts to locations other
than the company’s own DNS servers, as this
may be an indicator of a malware infection.
When code signing certificates are revoked
the date of effect of the revocation is chosen
so that, where possible, legitimate software
signed with the certificate continues to
validate. Unfortunately, this means that
sometimes malware signed with a
compromised certificate will also continue to
validate (despite the revocation).
Some malware attempts to communicate
with C2 infrastructure at frequent intervals.
The frequency of these communication
attempts can be used to detect the malicious
activity.
TCP port 443 traffic is often allowed out of a
network without inspection by network
security appliances as it is expected to be
legitimate, encrypted SSL communications
that can be difficult to inspect. Unfortunately,

�

�

�

�

�

attackers take advantage of this by using the
port to bypass security appliances to
communicate with a C2 server (such as with
the observed X­Shell communications).
Attackers often reuse the same code for their
malware. Sometimes they will recompile the
code, sometimes they will merely
reconfigure the malware. This alters the file
hash and therefore such a hash is not an
effective signature for other configurations
of the malware. Hashes of the individual code
sections (e.g. .text, .rdata, .reloc) make for
more robust detection as sections within the
malicious files often remain the same.
The majority of legitimate external network
communications use the DNS protocol to
determine their destination’s IP address.
Outbound network activity that occurs
without a DNS lookup should be treated with
suspicion until the purpose of the
communications can otherwise be
determined.
Blocking outbound communication attempts
that are not preceded by a DNS lookup can
be effective in blocking C2 communication
attempts that are made direct to an IP
address (such as to an IP address listed
within an X­Shell configuration webpage).
Legitimate destination IP addresses should
be whitelisted to prevent legitimate activity
from also being blocked.
Attackers will sometimes continue to use a
callback domain even when it is listed on
blacklists and in multiple malware analysis
reports.
Blacklisting a domain can be useful but
taking the time to research the domain and
associated activity can help with the
development of more effective, longer term
mitigation strategies.
