A Possible Re-brand of Rook Ransomware
Pandora ransomware came into the spotlight in March 2022 after targeting some high-profile victims on
its leak site. The ransomware group announced its first victim on 21 Feb 2022 and has posted around
five victims to date.

During a routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across the sample for this
ransomware. Upon execution, the file encrypts the victim’s system and drops the ransom note in each
folder named “Restore_My_Files.txt.” After encryption, the file is renamed with the extension “.Pandora“.

Technical Analysis
The malware (SHA 256: 5b56c5d86347e164c6e571c86dbf5b1535eae6b979fede6ed66b01e79ea33b7b)
is packed using the UPX packer. After unpacking, the payload is compiled using Visual C++. The file has
encrypted strings and several jumps and calls that can make debugging difficult, as shown below.

The malware runs a decryption loop that decrypts the strings present in the file, as shown in Figure 4.

Initially, the malware creates a mutex named “ThisIsMutexa” using CreateMutexA() API to ensure that
only one instance of the malware is running in the system.

The malware then loads ntdll.dll and calls the NtSetInformationProcess () API, which changes the
privilege level and sets the malware file as a critical process. The malware then disables the Event
Tracing for Windows (ETW) by patching the EtwEventWrite() function and further bypasses Antimalware
Scan Interface (AMSI) to evade detection by Anti-Virus products.
The AMSI allows the integration of applications and processes with the anti-malware solution present on
a system. AMSI scans files that are executed through PowerShell, Jscript, VBA, VBScript, etc.
The malware also calls SetProcessShutdownParameters() to reduce the process’s priority, i.e., set it to
zero. This means that malware will be terminated last before the system shutdown so that the malware
gets the maximum amount of time possible to execute in the compromised machine.
After altering the priority, the malware calls SHEmptyRecycleBinA() API to empty the recycle bin to
ensure no deleted files are restored after encryption.

Like other ransomware, the malware deletes shadow copies using vssadmin using ShellExecuteW()
API, as shown in Figure 6.

Before encrypting the machine, the malware gets the Volume details by calling the APIs such as:
GetDriveTypeW()
FindFirstVolumeW()
FindNextVolumeW()
GetVolumePathNamesForVolumeNameW()
GetLogicalDrives()
Before initiating encryption, the ransomware checks and excludes specific folders from encryption –
such as AppData, Boot, Windows, Windows.old, Tor Browser, Internet Explorer, Google, Opera, Opera
Software, Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, ProgramData, Program Files, Program Files (x86).
The Ransomware also excludes certain files from encryption such as autorun.inf, boot.ini, bootfont.bin,
bootsect.bak, bootmgr, bootmgr.efi, bootmgfw.efi, desktop.ini, iconcache.db, ntldr, ntuser.dat.
Additionally, specific extensions are also exempted from encryption – such as .pandora, .hta, .exe, .dll,
.cpl, .ini, .cab, .cur, .drv, .hlp, .icl, .icns, .ico, .idx, .sys, .spl, .ocx.
Finally, the ransomware searches for files using FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW () APIs and then
proceeds to encrypt them.
The malware uses multithreading approach for faster encryption. It calls CreateThread(),
SetThreadAffinityMask(), ResumeThread(), CreteIOCompletionPort() and
GetQueuedCompletionStatus() APIs for multithreading.
Finally, the ransom note is displayed, as shown in Figure 7.

Possible ROOK ransomware re-brand:
During our analysis, we found that the Tactic Technique and Procedures (TTPs) of the Pandora and
ROOK ransomware shared a lot of similarities.
In Dec 2021, ROOK ransomware posted on their leak site claiming to have attacked one of the world’s
largest automotive suppliers of technology and components. Following this, their leak site went down
around the end of Jan 2022.
Pandora ransomware in March 2022 posted the same victim on their leak site. Due to this incident and
the similarities in how they operate, it is suspected that Pandora might be a re-brand of ROOK
ransomware.

Conclusion

5/7

There’s a good chance that Pandora ransomware is a re-brand of ROOK ransomware. We had
observed similar behavior in the past when ransomware groups were coming up with new aliases when
they were under scrutiny.
Pandora ransomware gang is suspected of leveraging the double extortion method where the TAs
exfiltrate the victim’s data followed by data encryption. Then, they threaten to leak the exfiltrated data on
their leak site or on cybercrime forums.
Organizations can mitigate such attacks by monitoring the darkweb and acting upon early warning
indicators such as compromised credentials, data breaches, and identifying vulnerabilities traded on
cybercrime forums.

Our Recommendations:
Enforce password change policies for the network and critical business applications or consider
implementing multi-factor authentication for all remote network access points.
Reduce the attack surface by ensuring that sensitive ports are not exposed on the Internet.
Conduct cybersecurity awareness programs for employees and contractors.
Implement a risk-based vulnerability management process for IT infrastructure to ensure that
critical vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations are identified and prioritized for remediation.
Instruct users to refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their
authenticity.
Deploy reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your company-managed
devices, including PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.
Turn on the automatic software update features on computers, mobiles, and other connected
devices wherever possible and pragmatic.
Define and implement a backup process and secure those backup copies by keeping them offline
or on a separate network
