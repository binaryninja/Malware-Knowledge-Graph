Executive Summary
Over the past several weeks, Russia-Ukraine cyber activity has escalated substantially.
Beginning on Feb. 15, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks commenced.
These attacks have continued over the past week, impacting both the Ukrainian government
and banking institutions. On Feb. 23, a new variant of wiper malware named HermeticWiper
was discovered in Ukraine. Shortly after, a new round of website defacement attacks were
also observed impacting Ukrainian government organizations.
Consistent with our previous reporting on the topic, several western governments have
issued recommendations for their populations to prepare for cyberattacks that could disrupt,
disable or destroy critical infrastructure. We have already observed an increase in Russian
cyber activity, which we reported on in our initial Threat Brief published last month and our
recent report on the Gamaredon group. Future attacks may target U.S. and Western
European organizations in retaliation for increased sanctions or other political measures
against the Russian government. We recommend that all organizations proactively prepare to
defend against this potential threat.

This post was substantially updated on Feb. 24 to add information on the recent DDoS
attacks, HermeticWiper malware and website defacement; update our recommendations for
how organizations should prepare for potential cyber impact; and provide additional details
for our customers and clients on how we can help. This post was substantially updated March
31 to add information on phishing and scam attacks, cybersquatting trends, fake donation
websites, DoS attacks on Ukrainian news sites and distribution of malicious binaries.
Full visualization of the techniques observed, relevant courses of action and indicators of
compromise (IoCs) related to this report can be found in the Unit 42 ATOM viewer.
We will continue to provide updates with new information and recommendations as they
become available.

DDoS Attacks Impacting Ukrainian Government and Banking
Institutions
On Feb. 15, the Cyberpolice of Ukraine reported that residents were actively receiving fake
SMS text messages. These messages were likely intended to cause alarm among the
population, as they claimed that ATMs were malfunctioning.

3/21

Figure 1. Example text message provided by the Cyberpolice of Ukraine.

Shortly after the text messages were observed, several DDoS attacks occurred. These attacks
impacted Ukrainian government organizations including the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Armed Forces of Ukraine and the publicly funded broadcaster Ukrainian
Radio. Additionally, the attacks targeted two banking institutions, PrivatBank and
Oschadbank. An initial investigation into the DDoS attacks suggested that Mirai and Meris
bot networks may have been leveraged in the attacks.
On Feb. 18, both the United States and the United Kingdom attributed these DDoS attacks to
Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).

4/21

Over the past week, Ukraine has continued to observe a relatively constant flow of DDoS
attacks targeting its government and financial institutions. However, at this time, attribution
for the ongoing attacks has not been established. The Ukrainian CERT did identify a post on
RaidForums from a user named “Carzita” that suggested that additional actors may also be
launching DDoS and defacement attacks for undisclosed reasons.

HermeticWiper Malware

6/21

On Feb. 23, a malicious file named conhosts._exe (SHA256:
1bc44eef75779e3ca1eefb8ff5a64807dbc942b1e4a2672d77b9f6928d292591) was uploaded to
a public malware repository from an organization in Kyiv, Ukraine. This executable is a
signed file with a valid signature from an organization named Hermetica Digital Ltd. This
signing certificate has since been explicitly revoked by its issuer. Upon execution, this file
enumerates all files on a hard drive, wipes the partition info and then forces a system reboot,
which predictably results in the following screen:

Figure 3. Missing operating system after hard drive is wiped.

Further analysis has confirmed that the malware accepts command-line arguments allowing
an attacker to instruct the malware to sleep for a period of time or to shut down the system.
Additionally the kernel module responsible for the actual wiping activity is from a legitimate
application called EaseUS Partition Master. This software is designed as free partition
software that can reorganize disk space for better performance.
In tracking this threat, early reports show that the malware has been deployed against a
financial institution in Ukraine as well as two contractors in Latvia and Lithuania that
provide services to the Ukrainian Government. Additionally, ESET researchers have warned
that they found this malware installed across “hundreds of machines” in Ukraine.

Website Defacement
Concurrent with the discovery of wiper malware, we also witnessed a second round of
website defacements on Feb. 23. These attacks appear to have copied the messaging template
observed in attacks exploiting the OctoberCMS vulnerability a month earlier on Jan.14, while
adding a .onion web address and a message in red font that translates to, “Do you need proof,
see the link at the end.”

8/21

Figure 5. Website defacement message. A new message in red font translates to “Do you need proof, see
the link at the end.”

The .onion site links to an entity calling themselves “Free Civilian” and offering to sell
databases containing the personal data of Ukrainian citizens. Over the past 24 hours, the list
of entities on the leaks section has expanded to 48 gov.ua domains and one Ukranian
company (motorsich[.]com) that builds engines for airplanes and helicopters.

Rise in Phishing and Scam Attacks

11/21

Our team analyzed the larger trends regarding Ukraine-related phishing and scam URLs
detected by Advanced URL Filtering. We noticed an overall increase in the detection of
websites that host phishing and scam URLs on domains using Ukraine-related TLDs such as
gov.ua and com.ua, or containing popular Ukraine-related keywords such as "ukraine" and
"ukrainian". This trend correlates with an increase in Google searches for terms like "Ukraine
aid." The increase in online searches containing Ukraine-related keywords likely makes such
URLs a more lucrative target for attackers, and past examples show that attackers are known
for taking advantage of current events.
From January to late February, it appears that the number of Ukraine-related phishing and
scam sites largely followed a similar trend as Ukraine-related internet searches; however, the
number of phishing and scam sites has continued to rise through mid-late March as the
situation remains ongoing. Figure 8 shows that the number of Ukraine-related
phishing/scam sites is currently continuing to rise about a month after the “Ukraine aid”
search term started trending in Google search.

Figure 8. Comparison of the number of websites (hostnames) hosting Ukraine-related phishing and scam
URLs and worldwide search interest in “Ukraine Aid” as reported by Google Trends.

Among these phishing and scam URLs, we found a targeted phishing attack. On March 16
while ingesting a third-party data feed, our in-house machine learning models detected a
phishing webpage targeting a Ukrainian state administration employee. The webpage is
imitating a popular cloud file storage site. Upon visiting the webpage, the “Username” field is
pre-populated with the targeted employee’s email address, and the user is then prompted to
enter in their password in order to view a sensitive document as shown in Figure 9.
12/21

employee, detected by our in-house machine learning models on March 16.

Our teams at Palo Alto Networks are actively monitoring the phishing landscape surrounding
Ukraine-related URLs and are sharing this threat intelligence with relevant authorities in
Ukraine and internationally. We are also sharing a list of IoCs that were detected as phishing
and scam URLs. Palo Alto Networks customers who subscribe to Advanced URL Filtering are
already protected from these IoCs.

Increase in Cybersquatting Trends
We monitored a list of 50 legitimate Ukraine-related domains (e.g., popular news and
donation websites) and keywords (e.g., Ukraine, refugee) as targets for cybersquatting. We
detected 11,637 cybersquatting newly registered domains (NRDs) during February and
March. In particular, we noticed a sharp increase in the number of cybersquatting domains
that were registered close to Feb. 24, as shown in Figure 10 below.

13/21

Figure 10. A spike in the number of squatting NRDs close to Feb. 24.

We manually analyzed a sample set of these cybersquatting domains. Below we share some
interesting case studies.

Fake Donation Websites
We identified more than two dozen domains requesting donations to support Ukraine. A
detailed analysis of these domains revealed that many of them are fake. These donation
websites provide little to no information about the associated organization and distribution
of funds. Many of these websites use cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., BTC, ETH) to accept
payment (likely because these wallets are easy to set up and require no verification).
We also find that some websites are mimicking popular donation websites or organizations
to trick users into paying them money. We show some examples in Figure 11. For instance,
donatetoukraine[.]com is pretending to be associated with the popular Come Back Alive
campaign. While the banking information shared on the donation website matches the
original campaign website, we confirmed that the BTC wallet address is different from the
actual.

14/21

Figure 11. The screenshots show various examples of websites impersonating legitimate Ukrainerelated entities, asking for donations.

DoS Attacks on Ukrainian News Sites
We found a cybersquatting domain – save-russia[.]today – that is launching DoS attacks on
Ukrainian news sites. Once a user opens the website in the browser, it starts making requests
to various Ukrainian news sites and lists the number of requests made to each new site on the
home page, as shown in Figure 12 below.

15/21

Figure 12. A cybersquatting domain save-russia[.]today is launching DoS attacks on Ukrainian news sites.

We strongly recommend that users be alert to the possibility of cybersquatting domains. In
particular, fake donation websites mimicking popular websites can be misleading, as
described earlier. Before donating money, we recommend checking whether the website is
referenced and shared by the official charity or government organization. Our teams at Palo
Alto Networks will continue monitoring domain squatting attacks and work to protect
customers against them. We are also sharing a list of IoCs publicly and have shared this
threat intelligence with relevant authorities in Ukraine.

Distribution of Apps
We detected campaigns of fake downloads where threat actors have set up web pages to host
malicious binaries. We found that these campaigns were targeting Ukrainian users. Most of
these web pages show malicious binaries as popular browsers or communication apps in
order to deceive users. For example, we detected a website that was distributing a malicious
binary by masquerading as a popular global communication app targeting users in Ukraine.
This domain is still active and trying to target Ukrainian users at the time of writing this post.
Note that Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections against such domains from the
Next-Generation Firewall via Advanced URL Filtering, DNS Security and WildFire URL
Analysis subscriptions.

16/21

Figure 13: A website distributing a malicious binary by masquerading as a popular global
communication app.

We also found that these fake download campaigns rotate domains to distribute the same
malicious binaries. For example, we detected two domains distributing the same malicious
binary where one domain was impersonating a popular, widely used video conferencing
application and the other a widely used internet browser.
The distribution of fake browsers and communication apps targeting Ukrainian users at this
time is concerning. Our teams at Palo Alto Networks will continue to monitor and work to
protect our customers against such attacks. We are publicly sharing a list of IoCs and shared
this threat intelligence with relevant authorities in Ukraine. We also advise Ukrainian users
to only install software and apps from verified and official websites.

How Palo Alto Networks Is Working to Keep You Safe
Consistent with our previous reporting on the situation, Unit 42 continues to lead a
company-wide effort to collect, evaluate and disseminate the latest intelligence on cyber
activity related to Russia and Ukraine. We are actively collaborating with our partners in
industry and governments to share our analysis and findings based on our global threat
telemetry network.
These efforts have enabled us to make near-daily updates to our platform to ensure our
customers have the best protection possible. This includes blocking hundreds of domain
names, IP addresses and URLs for our customers related to newly discovered attacks. We’ve
updated and added signatures to the WildFire analysis and Cortex XDR Prevent and Pro
products to block newly discovered vulnerabilities and malware including HermeticWiper.
Read more about Cortex XDR protections. Our Threat Prevention and Web Application and
API Security products added coverage for the OctoberCMS vulnerability exploited in the
WhisperGate attacks, and we released an XSOAR Playbook to help organizations hunt for
this threat. Cortex Xpanse can assist with understanding and managing your organization’s
attack surface as well as identifying vulnerable resources.

17/21

We have released public reports on the WhisperGate attacks and the infrastructure and
tactics used by the Gamaredon group. On the Unit 42 website, you will also find a free ATOM
which contains a structured mapping of the Gamaredon group’s tactics aligned to MITRE’s
ATT&CK framework.
As the situation continues to develop, we’ll continue to update our blog with the latest
information.

How You Should Prepare for an Increase in Cyberthreats Such as
Wipers, DDoS, Website Defacement and Other Related Attacks
There is no single action you can take to protect your organization against this threat. Unlike
a new malware family or vulnerability in the wild, the attacks we expect could come in many
forms. Several western governments have proposed broad recommendations focused on
technical hygiene. We consider these appropriate given the variety of tactics that Russian
actors have used in the past.
We recommend organizations prioritize actions in the following four areas:
1. Patch Internet-Facing and Business Critical Software: Apply patches for any
software containing vulnerabilities – not just those known to be exploited in the wild.
This is most urgent for software that is internet-facing and necessary for your
business’s operations, such as webmail, VPNs and other remote access solutions.
2. Prepare for Ransomware and/or Data Destruction: A likely form of disruptive
cyberattack will either use ransomware or a destructive attack that poses as
ransomware. As we saw with the NotPetya attacks in 2017 and the WhisperGate attacks
just last month, an attack that demands a ransom may not actually be “ransomware.”
The malware used in these attacks destroyed data without any chance of recovery, using
the ransom demand simply to cover its true intention. The use of HermeticWiper
further demonstrates this point. The preparation required to prevent and recover from
these attacks is similar in either case. Testing back-up and recovery plans is critical, as
well as testing your continuity of operations plan in case your network or other key
systems are disabled in the attack.
3. Be Prepared to Respond Quickly: Ensure that you designate points of contact
across your organization in key areas in case of a cybersecurity incident or disruption in
critical infrastructure. Test your communication protocol (and backup protocols) to
avoid being caught without a clear mechanism to disseminate critical information.
Perform a table-top exercise with all of the key parties to walk through how you would
respond in the event the worst happens.

18/21

4. Lock Down Your Network: Making small policy changes can decrease the
likelihood of a successful attack against your network. Many applications
can be abused, even though the application itself may not be malicious. If
your organization doesn’t require their functionality, blocking them will
improve your security posture. For example, recent attacks have abused
popular applications – like Trello and Discord – to distribute malicious
files. Users didn’t need to use the software to be impacted, the attackers
simply used the platforms to host links to files.
There is no way to know for certain what shape an attack may take, but taking these steps will
help provide broad protection against what we expect to come.

How Unit 42 Threat Intelligence and Security Consulting Can Help
Unit 42, the threat intelligence and security consulting arm of Palo Alto Networks, has a team
of experts who can help your organization assess and test your security controls with
proactive assessments and incident simulation services. Because of the likelihood of
ransomware attacks – or destructive attacks that pose as ransomware – it may be beneficial
to focus on preparing in this area, particularly ensuring backup and recovery plans are in
place. We have distilled the knowledge we’ve gained from responding to hundreds of
ransomware incidents into our Ransomware Readiness Assessment offering, which is
designed to help organizations strengthen their processes and technology to mitigate threats
like the ones we expect in the coming days and weeks.

Appendix A: Cortex Xpanse: Identifying Assets That May Be
Impacted by CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities
In Alert AA22-011A (updated March 1, 2022), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS/CISA) identifies a selection of
vulnerabilities that Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are assessed to have
exploited in the past, but recommends that users take action against a much broader list of
known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs). The cited KEVs and their impacted devices – all of
which can be identified using Cortex Xpanse – are:
CVE-2018-13379 FortiGate VPNs
CVE-2019-1653 Cisco router
CVE-2019-2725 Oracle WebLogic Server
CVE-2019-7609 Kibana
CVE-2019-9670 Zimbra software
CVE-2019-10149 Exim Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure
CVE-2019-19781 Citrix
CVE-2020-0688 Microsoft Exchange
CVE-2020-4006 Multiple Vmware Products
CVE-2020-5902 F5 Big-IP
CVE-2020-14882 Oracle WebLogic
20/21

CVE-2021-26855 Microsoft Exchange
Cortex Xpanse’s ability to index the entire internet helps organizations discover, prioritize,
and remediate significant exposures on their attack surfaces – including all of the impacted
services listed above. We routinely observe vulnerable devices across the global internet,
despite the fact that most of these CVEs are more than two years old.
Beyond Alert AA22-011A, CISA’s overarching guidance for attack surface reduction includes
hardening of forward-facing network services, with prioritized patching of KEVs, as
documented in Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of
Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV). This directive requires agencies to remediate all
vulnerabilities that CISA includes in their KEV catalog based on an assessment that the
vulnerabilities “carry significant risk to the federal enterprise.” Learn more and see a detailed
workflow example on the Palo Alto Networks SecOps blog, “How Xpanse Can Identify CISAIdentified Known Exploited Vulnerabilities.”
