The BLINDINGCAN RAT and Malicious North Korean
Activity

August 31, 2020

There has been a great deal of coverage lately around malicious activities attributed to North
Korea (and/or adjacent entities). Most recently, this has culminated in the release of MAR
(Malware Analysis Report) AR20-232A, which covers activities associated with the
BLINDINGCAN RAT. This tool is the latest in a very long line of tools which allow attackers to
maintain access to target environments as well as establish ongoing control of infected
hosts. In this post, we give an overview of this campaign in context of other related
campaigns, describing its infection vector, execution and high-level behavior.

Infection Vector
As we know, email phishing attacks are still the dominant method of delivering malware
when it comes to these types of attacks. The BLINDINGCAN campaigns are no different, but
their phishing lure comes with an interesting twist: malicious documents utilized in the
campaign masquerade as job offers and postings from high-value defense contractors such
as Boeing.
This isn’t the first time such a lure has been used. Sophisticated attackers have sought to
mimic entities in the defense, military, and government space in the past. This is especially
true, historically, with campaigns tied to North Korea. Even early on in 2020, Operation North
Star followed a very similar modus operandi, and by some accounts these campaigns may
be related.
CISA maintains a running repository of North Korean / Hidden Cobra related advisories and
details. Their alerts cover campaigns from 2017 to present, including (but not limited to):
WannaCry – Massively destructive “ransomware” with SMB spreading capabilities.
Delta Charlie – Backdoor and Denial-of-Service tool set
Volgmer – Backdoor
FALLCHILL – Full-function RAT
BANKSHOT – RAT and proxy/tunneling tool set
HARDRAIN – RAT and proxy tool set w/ Android support
SHARPKNOT – MBR Wiper
TYPEFRAME – RAT and proxy/tunneling tool set
KEYMARBLE – Full-function RAT
FASTCash – RAT and proxy/tunneling tool set (Financial attacks)
2/6

BADCALL – RAT and proxy tool set w/ Android support
ELECTRICFISH – proxy/tunneling tool set
HOPLIGHT – proxy/tunneling tool set with pseudo-SSL spoofing
ARTFULPIE – Downloader and launcher tool set
CROWDEDFLOUNDER – Full-function RAT
TAINTEDSCRIBE – Downloader and launcher with LFSR (LInear Feedback Shift
Register) support
COPPERHEDGE – Full-function RAT, cryptocurrency and crypto-exchange focused.
In short, the DPRK has a long history of these types of campaigns and it does not appear to
be letting up in frequency or aggressiveness. Moreover, North Korea is no stranger to playing
the ‘long-game’. Reflecting back on earlier attacks from the region (e.g., Operation Troy, Ten
Days of Rain, Dark Seoul, and the Sony attack) we see similar tactics and aggressiveness.

The BLINDINGCAN campaign has been specifically focused on defense and aerospace
targets, primarily based in Europe and the United States. According to AR20-232a: “The FBI
has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction
with proxy servers” along with “compromised infrastructure from multiple countries to host its
command and control (C2) infrastructure”.
The objective of these attacks is to gain intelligence and to understand the key technologies
that fall under the umbrella of the targeted entity, as well as those adjacent to them
(contactors, partners, etc.)

BLINDINGCAN RAT: Execution and Behavior
The malicious documents themselves, upon launch, attempt to exploit CVE-2017-0199. This
particular flaw allows for remote code execution via maliciously crafted documents. More
specifically, CVE-2017-0199 is a result of the flawed processing of RTF files and elements by
way of a potent combination of object links and HTA payloads.
This vulnerability is a common vector of attack for malicious actors, and despite the flaw
being patched long ago, attackers bet on the fact (often successfully) that at least some of
their targets will still be exposed to the flaw, allowing them to achieve their foothold.
You can see this behavior immediately upon launching one of the malicious documents.

The samples we analyzed reach out to a remote server (C2) for additional components.
Once established, a keylogging and clipboard monitoring component is dropped, and
additional information is extracted from the targeted hosts. WMI commands are utilized to
gleen basic system details:
start iwbemservices::execquery - select * from win32_computersystemproduct

The RAT component (e.g.,
58027c80c6502327863ddca28c31d352e5707f5903340b9e6ccc0997fcb9631d ) can be

found in both 32 and 64 bit varieties. The executable payloads employ multiple levels of
obfuscation.
Configuration data for the RAT is embedded in the payloads and is both encrypted and
encoded. Embedded configuration artifacts are AES-encrypted with a hard-coded key. Upon
decrypting, the resulting data is then decoded via XOR. Strings in the malware are RC4
encrypted.
The RAT module will initially pull basic system data. The aforementioned WMI command is
part of this system reconnaissance process. In this stage, the malware will pull local network
data, system name, OS version details, processor/platform details and MAC address details,
and then push this data to the C2.
The core RAT feature set boils down to the following:
Gather and transmit defined set of System features
Create, terminate and manipulate processes
Create, terminate and manipulate files
Self-updating / self-deletion (cleaning of malicious code from the system when
necessary)

Conclusion
While the malware and implants discussed here are specific to operations attributed to North
Korea, the delivery and weaponization states are common to most other APT groups and
non-nation-state backed campaigns.
The key takeaways here are 1) it is important to keep abreast of the evolution of malicious
attacks generated from this region, but also 2) we can apply what we have learned from
other past attacks to improve our posture and reduce overall exposure, along with the
potential negative repercussions of suffering from such an attack. Prevention, as always, is
key. The SentinelOne Singularity Platform is fully capable of detecting and preventing
malicious activity associated with HIDDEN COBRA and BLINDINGCAN.
