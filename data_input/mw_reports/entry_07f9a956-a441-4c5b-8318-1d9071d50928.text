We have been tracking a prolific malvertising campaign for several weeks and captured a
variety of payloads, including several stealers. One that we initially identified as Arkei turned
out to be Vidar, a new piece of malware recently analyzed in detail by Fumik0_ in his
post: Let’s dig into Vidar – An Arkei Copycat/Forked Stealer (In-depth analysis).
In Norse Mythology, Víðarr is a god and son of Odin, whose death it is foretold he will
avenge. Being referred to as “The Silent One” seems to be fitting for this stealer that can
loot from browser histories (including Tor Browser) and cryptocurrency wallets, capture
instant messages, and much more.
We witnessed a threat actor using the Fallout exploit kit to distribute Vidar. But victims won’t
notice that as much, as the secondary and noisier payload being pushed is GandCrab
ransomware.

Overview
A malvertising chain leads us to the Fallout exploit kit followed by what we thought was an
Arkei stealer. Upon closer look, while the sample did share a lot of similarities with Arkei
(including network events), it was actually a newer and, at the time, not yet publicly
described piece of malware now identified as Vidar.

Beyond Vidar’s stealer capabilities, we also noticed a secondary payload that was retrieved
from Vidar’s own command and control (C2) server. The infection timeline showed that
victims were first infected with Vidar, which tried to extract confidential information, before
eventually being compromised with the GandCrab ransomware.

Malvertising and Fallout exploit kit
Torrent and streaming video sites drive a lot of traffic, and their advertising is often
aggressive and poorly-regulated. A malicious actor using a rogue advertising domain is
redirecting these site visitors according to their geolocation and provenance to at least two
different exploit kits (Fallout EK and GrandSoft EK), although the former is the most active.
Stealers such as AZORult seem to be the a favorite payload here, but we also noticed that
Arkei/Vidar was quite common. In this particular instance, we saw Vidar being pushed via the
Fallout exploit kit.

Vidar
It should be noted that Vidar is sold as a product, and as such can be distributed by several
different threat groups through different campaigns.

Vidar customers can customize the stealer via profiles, which gives them a way to adjust
which kind of data they are interested in. Beyond the usual credit card numbers and other
passwords stored in applications, Vidar can also scrape an impressive selection of digital
wallets.

3/7

Upon execution on the system, Vidar will search for any data specified in its profile
configuration and immediately send it back to the C2 server via an unencrypted HTTP POST
request.
This includes high level system details (specs, running processes, and installed applications)
and stats about the victim (IP address, country, city, and ISP) stored in a file
called information.txt. This file is packaged along with other stolen data and zipped before
being sent back to the C2 server.

4/7

GandCrab as a loader
Vidar also offers to download additional malware via its command and control server. This is
known as the loader feature, and again, it can be configured within Vidar’s administration
panel by adding a direct URL to the payload. However, not all instances of Vidar (tied to a
profile ID) will download an additional payload. In that case, the server will send back a
response of “ok” instead of a URL.
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date:
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
Server: Pro-Managed
Content-Length: 51
http://ovz1.fl1nt1kk.10301.vps.myjino[.]ru/topup.exe;

5/7

Within about a minute after the initial Vidar infection, the victim’s files will be encrypted and
their wallpaper hijacked to display the note for GandCrab version 5.04.

Ransomware as a last payload
While ransomware experienced a slowdown in 2018, it is still one of the more dangerous
threats. In contrast to many other types of malware, ransomware is instantly visible and
requires a call to action, whether victims decide to pay the ransom or not.
However, threat actors can use ransomware for a variety of reasons within their playbook. It
could be, for instance, a simple decoy where the real goal is to irreversibly corrupt systems
without any way to recover lost data. But as we see here, it can be coupled with other threats
and used as a last payload when other resources have already been exhausted.
As a result, victims get a double whammy. Not only are they robbed of their financial and
personal information, but they are also being extorted to recover the now encrypted data.
Malwarebytes users are protected against this threat at multiple levels. Our signatureless
anti-exploit engine mitigates the Internet Explorer and Flash Player exploits delivered by the
Fallout exploit kit. We detect the dropped stealer as Spyware.Vidar and also thwart
GandCrab via our anti-ransomware module.
