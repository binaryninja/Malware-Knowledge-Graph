The FBI has formally linked the Diavol ransomware operation to the TrickBot Group, the
malware developers behind the notorious TrickBot banking trojan.
The TrickBot Gang, aka Wizard Spider, are the developers of malware infections that have
played havoc on corporate networks for years, commonly leading to Conti and Ryuk
ransomware attacks, network infiltration, financial fraud, and corporate espionage.
The TrickBot Gang is most known for its namesake, the TrickBot banking trojan, but is also
behind the development of the BazarBackdoor and Anchor backdoors.

In July 2021, researchers from FortiGuard Labs released an analysis of a new ransomware
called Diavol (Romanian for Devil) that was seen targeting corporate victims.
The researchers saw both Diavol and Conti ransomware payloads deployed on a network in
the same ransomware attack in early June 2021.
After analyzing the two ransomware samples, similarities were discovered, such as their
use of asynchronous I/O operations for file encryption queuing and almost identical
command-line parameters for the same functionality.
At the time, there was not enough evidence to formally link the two operations.
However, a month later, IBM X-Force researchers established a stronger
connection between Diavol ransomware and other TrickBot Gang's malware, such as
Anchor and TrickBot.

Today, the FBI has formally announced that they have linked the Diavol Ransomware
operation to the TrickBot Gang in a new advisory sharing indicators of compromise seen in
previous attacks.
"The FBI first learned of Diavol ransomware in October 2021. Diavol is associated with
developers from the Trickbot Group, who are responsible for the Trickbot Banking Trojan,"
the FBI states in a new FBI Flash advisory.
Since then, the FBI has seen ransom demands ranging between $10,000 and $500,000,
with lower payments accepted after ransom negotiations.

These amounts are in stark contrast to the higher ransoms demanded by other ransomware
operations linked to TrickBot, such as Conti and Ryuk, who have historically asked for multimillion dollar ransoms.
For example, in April, the Conti ransomware operation demanded $40 million from Florida's
Broward County School district and $14 million from chip maker Advantech.
The FBI was likely able to formally link Diavol to the TrickBot Gang after the arrest of Alla
Witte, a Latvian woman involved in the development of ransomware for the malware gang.
Vitali Kremez, CEO of AdvIntel, who has been tracking the TrickBot operations, told
BleepingComputer that Witte was responsible for the development of the new TrickBotlinked ransomware.
"Alla Witte played a critical role for the TrickBot operations and based on the previous
AdvIntel deep adversarial insight she was responsible for the development of the Diavol
ransomware and frontend/backend project meant to support TrickBot operations with the
specific tailored ransomware with the bot backconnectivity between TrickBot and Diavol,"
Kremez told BleepingComputer in a conversation.
"Another name for the Diavol ransomware was called "Enigma" ransomware leveraged by
the TrickBot crew before the Diavol re-brand."
The FBI's advisory contains numerous indicators of compromise and mitigations for Diavol,
making it an essential read for all security professionals and Windows/network
administrators.

It should be noted that the Diavol ransomware originally created ransom notes named
'README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt' as pointed out by the FBI advisory, but BleepingComputer
has seen the ransomware gang switch in November to ransom notes named 'Warning.txt.'
The FBI also urges all victims, regardless of whether they plan to pay a ransom, to promptly
notify law enforcement of attacks to collect fresh IOCs that they can use for investigative
purposes and law enforcement operations.
If you are affected by a Diavol attack, it is also important to notify the FBI before paying as
they "may be able to provide threat mitigation resources to those impacted by Diavol
ransomware."
