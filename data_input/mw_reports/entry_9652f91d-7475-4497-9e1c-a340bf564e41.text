LockBit 3.0 ransomware (aka LockBit Black) is an evolution of the prolific LockBit
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) family, which has roots that extend back to BlackMatter
and related entities. After critical bugs were discovered in LockBit 2.0 in March 2022, the
authors began work on updating their encryption routines and adding several new features
designed to thwart researchers. In June 2022, LockBit 3 caught the interest of the media as
the ransomware operators announced they were offering a ‘bug bounty’ to researchers. In
this post, we provide an overview of the LockBit 3.0 ransomware update and offer a technical
dive for researchers into LockBit 3.0’s anti-analysis and evasion features.

LockBit 3.0 Changes and New Features Since LockBit 2.0
Around June of 2022, operators and affiliates behind LockBit ransomware began the shift to
LockBit 3.0. Adoption of LockBit 3.0 by affiliates has been rapid, and numerous victims have
been identified on the new “Version 3.0” leak sites, a collection of public blogs naming noncompliant victims and leaking extracted data.

In order to improve resilience, the operators have been aggressive with regards to standing
up multiple mirrors for their leaked data and publicizing the site URLs.
LockBit has also added an instant search tool to their leaks site.

The authors of LockBit 3.0 have introduced new management features for affiliates and
added Zcash for victim payments in addition to Monero and Bitcoin.

The ransomware authors also claim to have opened a public “bug bounty” program.
Ostensibly, this appears to be an effort to improve the quality of the malware, and financially
reward those that assist.

On top of that, there is a purported $1 million reward on offer to anyone who can uncover the
identity of the program affiliate manager. Understandably, given the criminal nature of the
operators, would-be researchers may find that reporting bugs to a crimeware outfit may not
lead to the promised payout but could lead to criminal charges from law enforcement.

LockBit 3.0 Payloads and Encryption
The updated LockBit payloads retain all the prior functionality of LockBit 2.0.
Initial delivery of the LockBit ransomware payloads is typically handled via 3rd party
frameworks such as Cobalt Strike. As with LockBit 2.0, we have seen infections occur down
the chain from other malware components as well, such as a SocGholish infection dropping
Cobalt Strike, which in turn delivers the LockBit 3 ransomware.
The payloads themselves are standard Windows PE files with strong similarities to prior
generations of LockBit as well as BlackMatter ransomware families.

PEStudio view of LockBit 3.0 Payload
LockBit ransomware payloads are designed to execute with administrative privileges. In the
event that the malware does not have the necessary privileges, a UAC bypass will be
attempted (CMSTP).
LockBit 3.0 achieves persistence via installation of System Services. Each execution of the
payload will install multiple services. We have observed the following service names in
conjunction with LockBit 3.0 ransomware payloads.
SecurityHealthService
Sense
sppsvc
WdBoot
WdFilter
WdNisDrv
WdNisSvc
WinDefend
wscsvc
vmicvss
vmvss
VSS
EventLog

As with previous versions, LockBit 3.0 will attempt to identify and terminate specific services
if found. The following service names are targeted for termination in analyzed LockBit 3.0
samples:

LockBit 3.0 writes a copy of itself to the %programdata% directory, and subsequently
launches from this process.

The encryption phase is extremely rapid, even when spreading to adjacent hosts. The
ransomware payloads were able to fully encrypt our test host in well under a minute.
On execution, the LockBit 3.0 ransomware will drop newly-formatted ransom notes along
with a change to the desktop background. Interestingly, notepad and wordpad are included in
the list of prescribed processes as noted above. Therefore, if a victim attempts to open the
ransom note immediately after it is dropped, it will promptly close since the process is
blocked until the ransomware completes its execution.
The new LockBit 3.0 ransomware desktop wallpaper is a simple text message on a black
background.

The extension appended to newly encrypted files will also differ per campaign or sample.
For example, we have seen “HLJkNskOq” and “futRjC7nx”. Both encrypted files and the
ransom notes will be prepended with the campaign-specific string.
futRjC7nx.README
HLJkNskOq.README

During our analysis, we observed infected machines shutting down ungracefully
approximately 10 minutes after the ransomware payload was launched. This behavior may
vary per sample, but it is worth noting.
Post-infection, LockBit 3.0 victims are instructed to make contact with their attacker via their
TOR-based “support” portal.

LockBit 3.0 Ransom Note Excerpt

LockBit 3 Anti-Analysis & Evasion
The LockBit 3.0 ransomware uses a variety of anti-analysis techniques to hinder static and
dynamic analysis, and exhibits similarities to the BlackMatter ransomware in this regard.
These techniques include code packing, obfuscation and dynamic resolution of function
addresses, function trampolines, and anti-debugging techniques. In this section, we cover
some of the anti-analysis techniques that LockBit 3.0 uses.
LockBit 3.0 payloads require a specific passphrase to execute. The passphrase is unique to
each sample or campaign and serves to hinder dynamic and sandbox analysis if the
passphrase has not been recovered along with the sample. A similar technique has been
used by Egregor and BlackCat ransomware. The passphrase is provided upon execution via
the -pass parameter. For example,
lockbit.exe -pass XX66023ab2zyxb9957fb01de50cdfb6

Encrypted content located in the LockBit 3.0 payload is decrypted at runtime using an XOR
mask. The images below show the content of the ransomware’s .text executable segment
before (label 1) and after (label 2) the ransomware has decrypted the segment content. The
.text segment starts at the virtual address 0x401000.

executable segment
LockBit 3.0 also first stores in heap memory and then uses trampolines for executing
functions, for example, the Windows system calls NtSetInformationThread and
ZwProtectVirtualMemory . The ransomware obfuscates the function addresses that the
trampolines execute using the XOR and/or bit rotation obfuscation technique.

LockBit 3.0 implements
Several techniques are implemented for detecting the presence of a debugger and hindering
dynamic analysis. For example, the ransomware evaluates whether heap memory
parameters that indicate the presence of a debugger are set. Such flags are
HEAP_TAIL_CHECKING_ENABLED (0x20) and
HEAP_VALIDATE_PARAMETERS_ENABLED (0x40000000).
LockBit 3.0 examines the ForceFlags value in its PEB (Process Environment Block) to
evaluate whether HEAP_VALIDATE_PARAMETERS_ENABLED is set.

LockBit 3.0 evaluates whether

HEAP_VALIDATE_PARAMETERS_ENABLED is set
The ransomware also evaluates whether the 0xABABABAB byte signature is present at the
end of heap memory blocks that it has previously allocated. The presence of this byte
signature means that HEAP_TAIL_CHECKING_ENABLED is set.

LockBit 3.0 evaluates whether

HEAP_TAIL_CHECKING_ENABLED is set

9/14

The LockBit 3.0 ransomware executes the NtSetInformationThread function through a
trampoline, such that the ThreadHandle and ThreadInformationClass function
parameters have the values of 0xFFFFFFFE and 0x11 ( ThreadHideFromDebugger ). This
stops the flow of events from the current ransomware’s thread to an attached debugger,
which effectively hides the thread from the debugger and hinders dynamic analysis.

LockBit 3.0 executes NtSetInformationThread
In addition, LockBit scrambles the implementation of the DbgUiRemoteBreakin function to
disable debuggers trying to attach to the ransomware process. When it executes, LockBit 3.0
ransomware:
Resolves the address of DbgUiRemoteBreakin .
Executes the ZwProtectVirtualMemory function through a trampoline to apply the
PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40) protection to the first 32 bytes of the memory
region where the implementation of DbgUiRemoteBreakin resides. This makes the
bytes writable.
Executes the SystemFunction040 (RtlEncryptMemory) function through a trampoline
to encrypt the bytes that the ransomware has previously made writable. This scrambles
the implementation of the DbgUiRemoteBreakin function and disables debuggers to
attach to the ransomware process.

(label 1) and after (label 2) the LockBit 3.0 ransomware has modified the implementation of

Conclusion
LockBit has fast become one of the more prolific ransomware-as-a-service operators out
there, taking over from Conti after the latter’s fractious fallout in the wake of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine.

LockBit’s developers have shown that they are quick to respond to problems in the product
they are offering and that they have the technical know-how to keep evolving. The recent
claim to be offering a ‘bug bounty’, whatever its true merits, displays a savvy understanding
of their own audience and the media landscape that surrounds the present tide of crimeware
and enterprise breaches.
Short of intervention by law enforcement, we expect to see LockBit around for the forseeable
future and further iterations of what is undoubtedly a very successful RaaS operation. As
with all ransomware, prevention is better than cure, and defenders are encouraged to ensure
that they have comprehensive ransomware protection in place. SentinelLabs will continue to
offer updates and reports on LockBit activity as it develops.
