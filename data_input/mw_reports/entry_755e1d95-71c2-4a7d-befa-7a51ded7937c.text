INTRODUCTION
and top 10 trends

END OF AN ERA OF CYBERSPACE STABILITY
Over the past decade, the number
and complexity level of cyberattacks
carried out by both state-sponsored
hacking groups and financially
motivated cybercriminals have increased
significantly. People, businesses, and
government institutions can no longer

be confident in neither the security
of cyberspace nor the integrity and
security of their data.
The Internet has become our
civilization’s circulatory system. Yet
the freedom of communication and

the global opportunities provided
by the Internet are increasingly
being threatened. Data leaks and
cyberattacks by unfriendly states are part
of today’s everyday reality.

The freedom of communication and the global opportunities that the
Internet provides are at risk
For more than 16 years, Group-IB experts
have been investigating cyber incidents
by analyzing the tools and infrastructure
used by attackers. Each new cyberattack
targeting a company, political party,
or critical infrastructure facility gives
us the opportunity to see how attack
tactics and tools evolve.
As a company, we strongly believe
that public organizations and private
companies that fight against cybercrime

must exchange data and publish
their research. That is why 6 years
ago we released the first High-Tech
Crime Trends report. Every year,
Group‑IB's annual report highlights the
changes that have occurred over the past
year. It is the most comprehensive source
of strategic and tactical data on current
global cyberthreats. This year’s study
covers the period H2 2018 — H1 2019
as compared to H2 2017 — H1 2018.

By using unique tools for monitoring
the infrastructure of cybercriminals and
studying the findings published by other
security teams worldwide, we find and
confirm common patterns that form
an integral picture of the evolving
cyberthreat landscape. On this basis,
we formulate forecasts that come true
every year.

Group-IB’s report: a single comprehensive source of strategic data
on cyberthreats and reliable forecasts of their development
The leading and most frightening trend
of 2019 was the use of cyberweapons
in military operations. Conflicts between
states have taken on new forms, and
cyber activity plays a leading role

in this destructive dialogue. Attacks
on critical infrastructure and targeted
destabilization of the Internet in certain
countries are breaking new ground
on cyberattacks. A peaceful existence

is no longer possible while being
out of touch with cybersecurity. The
latter cannot be ignored by any state,
corporation, or individual.

Targeted destabilization of the Internet heralds a new
era of cyberattacks

Group-IB supports the initiatives of The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC), created
to provide recommendations for promoting cyber stability in the world.

TOP 10 TRENDS
Military operations
conducted using
cyberweapons

3 military operations
were conducted in the first half of 2019
when cyberweapons were involved

In the first half of 2019, three open military operations became known: in March,
a successful attack on a Venezuelan hydroelectric plant caused a massive blackout
that left much of the country in the dark for several days; in May, in response
to a cyberattack, Israel's military retaliated with an airstrike against a building
known to be the cyber HQ for Hamas; and in June, a cyberattack was conducted
on Iranian computer systems that controlled its rocket and missile launchers
in response to Iran's downing of a US drone. The attack tools involved in all the
above cases have not been identified, and in the latter case, a cyberattack occurred
just a few days after the drone incident. This confirms the assumption that critical
infrastructures of many countries have been compromised and that attackers
go unnoticed until it is too late.

Internet destabilization
at the state level

Nowadays, the most social and economic damage can be caused by depriving
people and businesses of Internet access. That being said, countries that build
centralized access control to the Internet are becoming more vulnerable and may
become the first targets.

All levels

In recent years, treat actors have tested attacks on various levels of the
communications infrastructure. By the end of 2019, researchers had detected
successful attacks on Internet routing systems and BGP hijacks, attacks on DNS
root server administrators, national domain administrators and domain name
registrars as well as DNS hijacks, and attacks on local systems of filtering and
blocking traffic.

of communications infrastructure

5G expansion-related
challenges

The development
of 5G networks

Shifting to 5G networks will further deteriorate the situation in the
telecommunications sector. One of the reasons is that 5G architecture paves the
way for new types of attacks on operators. Another reason is that competition for
a new market may lead to hacking capabilities being demonstrated against certain
vendors and result in countless anonymous investigations into the vulnerabilities
of some technological solutions.

will create new threats

Hidden threats linked to
state-sponsored groups

38 state-sponsored
groups
were active throughout the period
investigated; 7 of them are new

Although many investigations into new state-sponsored groups were published
in the previous period, this sphere remains poorly understood. The activity
of 38 groups was discovered; seven of them are new cyberespionage groups.
This does not mean that other well-known groups ceased their activity, however.
It is more likely that their campaigns remained under the radar. In the energy
sector, for example, only two frameworks capable of affecting processes were
detected: Industroyer and Triton (Trisis). Both were found as a result of an error
on the part of their operators.
It is highly likely that there is a significant number of similar, undetected threats,
which essentially is a ticking time bomb. It is also worth noting that publicly known
state-sponsored groups mainly originate from developing countries. There is still
no public information about such attacks orchestrated by developed countries.

Hacking back: statesponsored groups go
against each other

Iran, China, and Russia

In 2019, cases where threat actors disguised as hacktivists or former group
members released information about attack tools used by other groups became
more frequent. They were most often examples of hacking back, when attackers
become the victims. Today, private companies cannot legally conduct such
operations. Hacking back is authorized only in the case of national security
services.

Russian-speaking groups

attacks shift their focus
to foreign banks

Сobalt and Silence

Currently, only five groups pose a real threat to the financial sector: Cobalt, Silence,
MoneyTaker (Russia), Lazarus (North Korea), and SilentCards (a new group from
Kenya).
In Russia, damage from targeted attacks on banks carried out by financially
motivated threat groups has dwindled almost 14-fold. One of the reasons is that
Russian-speaking threat actors have been shifting to banks worldwide.

began attacking mainly banks
outside Russia

Trojans for PC and Android
are gradually disappearing

22 trojans
for PCs and Android fell out of use and only
7 new tools appeared to replace them

The trend of Trojans for PCs disappearing from the cyberthreat landscape
continues. in Russia, the "homeland" of this type of threat, hackers have stopped
developing them. Brazil is becoming the main source of new PC Trojans. However,
they are used locally only.
Only Trickbot has evolved significantly over the past year and can now be used
in targeted attacks on banks and for espionage against government agencies,
as was the case with the Trojan Zeus.
Android Trojans are disappearing slower than PC malware, but in any case the
number of new ones is significantly lower than those that have disappeared.
Banking fraud malware has evolved from text message interception to automatic
transfer of funds through mobile banking applications; this new feature is called
ATS, i.e. Automated Transfer System. The number of active Trojans will continue
to decline due to the introduction of security measures and a sharp reduction
in economic efficiency for attackers.

Evolution of social
engineering without the
use of malware

Remote access tools

Amid slumping Trojans, the threat of social engineering without the use of malware
is growing. Attackers continue to use fake social media accounts, phone fraud
with well-prepared scripts, passport databases for reliability, etc. Relatively new
methods of social engineering include controlling phones using remote access
programs that victims install on their devices after being tricked into doing
so by scammers.

engineering vector

Growth of the carding
market thanks to
JS sniffers

$229 million

With a drop in ROI from the use of banking Trojans for PCs and Android, attackers
began to use a more effective method to make money: JS sniffers. There are
already more JS sniffers than banking Trojans for PC and Android. The total
number of cards compromised by JS sniffers has increased by 38%. JS sniffers
will be the most rapidly evolving threat and mainly affect countries where the
3D Secure system is not widely used.

RedCurl
a new group detected by Group-IB

In 2019, Group-IB detected attacks by a new group called RedCurl. The
group’s main goals are cyber espionage and financial theft. Once important
documentation has been exfiltrated, the hackers install miners in the compromised
company’s infrastructure. The group’s distinctive feature is the high quality of their
phishing attacks, as part of which they tailor emails to the company they are
targeting. The threat actor uses a unique custom Trojan that communicates with
the C&C server via legitimate services, which makes it very difficult to detect its
malicious activity in infrastructures.

KEY FINDINGS
and forecasts

STATE-SPONSORED THREAT GROUPS,
CYBERWEAPONS, AND CYBERWARS
CURRENT THREATS
For the first time in history, a missile
strike was carried out in response
to a cyberattack. The threat actors’
command center was destroyed
as a result. The strike was launched
by Israel, and the laws of other countries
do not prohibit military action in response
to cyberattacks. This sets an extremely
dangerous precedent.
World leaders claim that cyberweapons
can be used to disrupt adversaries’
defense infrastructure. Deploying such
weapons essentially equates to a military
operation on another country’s territory.
The blackout in Venezuela that left most
of the country without electricity for days
was partially caused by a cyberattack.
It is believed that the attack was carried
out by the opposition to destabilize the
country.

State-sponsored attackers are increasingly
interested in telecommunications
infrastructures. Their targets are operators,
domain name registrars, and organizations
responsible for top-level domains and root
name servers.
Some state-sponsored threat groups
go against each other. Disguised
as hacktivists, they make public the
tools used by their rivals and information
about them. On the one hand, this helps
criminal investigators find perpetrators.
On the other hand, it helps attackers
better imitate the activity of other
groups.
Attacks were carried out successfully
on computer manufacturers, with the
aim of delivering malicious code to the
equipment they produce. This shows
that many manufacturers are not ready
to fight targeted attacks, and supply
chain attacks on their customers will
remain a relevant attack vector.

38 groups
of state-sponsored attackers were
active throughout the period
investigated

7 new cyberspionage
groups
were discovered this year

Security analysts
mainly analyze groups from Russia,
North Korea, Pakistan, China, Vietnam,
Iran, the US, the UAE, India, Turkey, and
South America

about research into cyberattacks
carried out by world powers remains
unpublished

FORECAST: USE OF CYBERWEAPONS TO DISRUPT INTERNET STABILITY IN SOME COUNTRIES
Scenarios in which a country could
be disconnected from the Internet
seemed unrealistic, yet they are
becoming increasingly likely. Disrupting
the Web requires long-term preparation,
but it is technically feasible. The
increasing warmongering rhetoric and
aggression could lead to demonstrations
of such capabilities. Governments
and businesses must ensure that their
services are robust enough to withstand
such situations.

Domain name registrars are part
of critical infrastructures. Disrupting
their work affects the World Wide Web,
which is why registrars are targeted
by government-sponsored threat actors.
Next year, there will be a high risk of more
threat actors carrying out successful
attacks, including for sabotage purposes.

such countries are at higher risk of falling
victim to attacks that disrupt the Web
and cause more damage. As a result,
these countries may become a place
where threat actors conduct such attacks
and showcase their ability to disrupt the
Internet.

Certain countries are trying to build
a system of centralized control over
Internet access. This runs contrary to the
principle of Internet robustness and

KEY TRENDS AND FORECASTS BY INDUSTRY
Threats to the telecommunications sector
CURRENT THREATS
A major threat to the
telecommunications sector is BGP
hijacking, which disrupts the accessibility
of networks and many services they
power. After such attacks, restoring
accessibility usually takes several hours.
The expansion of 5G networks opens
up new opportunities for threat actors,
as does any type of next-generation
technology. 5G architecture paves the
way for new types of attacks on operators.

Vulnerable routers, which are rented out
to legal entities and individuals, present
an enormous threat to the telecom
sector. Insecure settings coupled with
no updates result in deteriorated services
and more malicious traffic. This gives
threat actors the opportunity to carry
out various attacks based on operators’
infrastructures.

9 groups
posed a threat to the
telecommunications sector during the
period investigated, i.e. more than to
the financial sector

Espionage and supply
chain attacks
are the main goals of these groups,
which is why their activity remains
unnoticed for longer

FORECAST: THE DEVELOPMENT OF 5G NETWORKS WILL CREATE NEW THREATS
The cybersecurity level of 5G market
players will be a factor that determines
their share of the market.
Cybersecurity problems faced
by a 5G platform provider give other
providers a competitive advantage.
Demonstrations of ways to exploit and
disrupt the work of 5G operators will
be used as a tool of unfair competition.
Successful attacks could cause providers
irreparable reputational damage.

Wider 5G integration will significantly
increase the capabilities of ordinary
cybercriminals to carry out DDoS attacks,
manipulate traffic, and spread malware.
In a few years, telecom companies
will struggle to detect hardware and
firmware backdoors in 5G infrastructure
equipment.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

Many telecom operators are Managed
Service Providers and provide security
services to government and commercial
organizations. Threat actors will attack
operators to penetrate the networks they
protect.

10

Threats to the energy sector
CURRENT THREATS
Compromising IT networks using
traditional techniques and malware—
including living off the land attacks—
is the main vector for penetrating isolated
segments of OT networks.

Both frameworks were detected
due to a mistake on the part of their
operators. It is clear that many threats
remain undetected, which is a ticking
time bomb.

Only two frameworks capable
of affecting processes, Industroyer and
Triton (Trisis), were detected in recent
years. Cybersecurity experts link them
to Russia.

In 2019, Lazarus attacked an energy
company in India. The target is not
an obvious choice for a state-sponsored
threat group, which could point to the
military’s growing interest in this type
of attack.

7 groups
posed a threat to the energy sector
in the period investigated

Iran and Russia
are associated with these groups

FORECAST: IT NETWORKS AND SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS WILL BE THE MAIN PENETRATION VECTOR
IT networks will remain the main attack
vector for threat actors. Access to these
segments is crucial for espionage and
collecting information about how
to attack a particular energy company for
sabotage purposes.
OT network compromise will be the next
step once the network’s IT segment
is successfully breached. Detecting
OT compromise is only possible in two
cases: if the attack is designed for

sabotage purposes or if the malware
operator makes a mistake. Attackers
often try to be as covert as possible until
they must carry out a mass attack.
Supply chain attacks will pose a serious
problem for the energy sector from the
part of various software and hardware
providers. Management companies will
be attacked first, then used to penetrate
networks belonging to energy
companies.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

The most significant threat is expected
to come from developed countries.
Threat actors in such regions are better
equipped, which is why their activity
is less noticeable and less thoroughly
investigated.

11

Threats to the financial sector
Targeted attacks on the financial sector
CURRENT THREATS
Silence stopped using mail-outs, instead
buying them from other hacking groups
(especially TA505).

SilentCards is a new group that carries
out targeted attacks on banks in Africa.
Despite their poor technical skills
(compared to other groups), they
successfully steal money in this region.

5 groups
posed a real threat to the financial
sector during the period investigated —
Cobalt, Silence, MoneyTaker, Lazarus,
SilentCards

Each Russian-speaking group carried
out an attack in Russia over the period
investigated. Cobalt attempted to steal
from a company twice, but the theft
did not cause any significant financial
damage. Compared to the previous
period, the average stolen sum in Russia
dropped from $1.8 million to $480,000,
with the total stolen sum amounting
to $1.5 million, i.e. 93% less than in the
previous period.

FastCash, a new theft method, was
detected in 2018, though it was first used
in Asia in as early as 2016. The Lazarus
group is behind all attacks of this kind.
Experts observed the following trends
in attack schemes: Silence was the only
threat actor that carried out attacks
through ATMs; Silence and SilentCards
used card processing, while Lazarus used
SWIFT (two successful thefts in India and
Malta amounting to $16 million in total).

3 out of 5 groups
are Russian speakers (Cobalt, Silence,
and MoneyTaker); they are the only
owners of Trojans that control ATM
dispensers

2 out of 3 groups
that are Russian speakers (Сobalt and
Silence) started mainly attacking banks
outside Russia

FORECAST: LARGER GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF RUSSIAN-SPEAKING GROUPS
out successful attacks through ATM
Switch against banks that use software
running on IBM AIX. Such banks will
therefore be the first to catch the threat
group’s attention.

Russian-speaking groups (Silence,
MoneyTaker, and Cobalt) are
likely to continue their expansion
by multiplying their attacks outside
Russia. To withdraw money, they will carry
out attacks on card processing systems
and use Trojans for ATMs. The groups will
shift their focus away from SWIFT.

Infrastructure disruption to cover tracks
will be the final stage of successful
attacks.

Lazarus will remain the only group to steal
money through SWIFT and ATM Switch.
The threat actor has previously carried

other industries. Their main vector will
be blackmail in ransomware attacks.
The Trickbot Trojan has markedly
improved (see section Banking Trojans
for PC) and can now be used in targeted
attacks on banks and for espionage
against government agencies, as was the
case with the Trojan Zeus.

SilentCards may remain local and focus
on African banks. The group is likely
to expand its list of targets by attacking

Non-targeted attacks and threats to banking customers
Growth in carding activities due to the spread of JS sniffers
Dumps continue to have the largest
share of the carding market, with a 46%
increase in the number of dumps for sale.
The sale of textual data (card number,
CVV, expiration date) is also on the rise,
with a 19% growth.
The largest bank card data leaks are
related to compromises of US retailers.
The US is far ahead and comes first, with
93% of all cards compromised.
Middle Eastern countries (Kuwait,
Pakistan, the UAE, and Qatar) together
account for 2.38% in this classification.
It is believed that the increase in the
number of compromised cards was
caused by Lazarus attacks in late 2018
and early 2019.

JS sniffers became a point of growth
as regards the volume of textual data.
As at spring 2019, Group-IB detected
38 different JS sniffer families. At the time
of publishing this report, that number has
even grown. There are more JS sniffers
than banking Trojans.
In terms of JS sniffer–related attacks, the
US is first again, with UK banks coming
second. This is mainly due to the attack
on British Airways in late 2018, which
resulted in more than 300,000 bank
cards being compromised.

38% growth
in the total number of
compromised cards

$229 million
fine imposed on British Airways
as a result of a data breach

FORECAST: DECLINE IN PHISHING AND EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING
Phishing kit developers began devoting
more attention to self-defense. They
blacklist cybersecurity vendors’ subnets
and hosting providers, show phishing
content only from the IP addresses of the
region where their victims are located,
redirect users to legitimate websites, and
check anomalous user agents.

New sophisticated social
engineering methods
Considerably reduced activity of
banking Trojans for PC and Android,
combined with fewer phishing attacks,
has made theft methods using social
engineering the most widespread
threat.

In an effort to attract customers, phishing
kit developers started equipping their kits
with user-friendly management systems.
Now, instead of working with logs via
email, customers can conveniently
manage data via simple web panels.
Financial phishers began using panels
for managing web injects and the autofill
function. Such panels have previously
been used in banking Trojans.

Social engineering comes in many
forms. Schemes in which victims
are prompted to reveal their logins,
passwords, and bank card details and
transfer money via ATMs and mobile
applications are widely known. Threat
actors use various channels to contact
their victims, such as phone calls,
messaging apps, and social media.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

SMS traffic in certain countries
is becoming a common tool for sharing
links to phishing websites. As a result,
leaks of phone number databases and
access to personal mobile operator
accounts, which can be used to send SMS
messages, are becoming more popular.

Moreover, new types of social
engineering techniques are emerging.
For instance, as part of an increasingly
popular scheme, users are asked to
install a remote control tool on their
mobile device, thereby giving the
hackers access to all applications and
data thereon.

14

Fewer banking Trojans for PC
Russian-speaking hackers no longer
create banking Trojans for PC. Brazil
has become a new source of this type
of malware. So far, it is used to attack the
local population only.

7 Trojans for PC
fell out of use, with no new ones created
by Russian-speaking hackers during the
period investigated

Owners of old botnets are not expanding
their geographical scope and tend
to attack banking customers in two
or three countries where it is easier for
them to launder stolen money.
There are two groups that still steal
money in Russia using Trojans for PC:
RTM and Buhtrap2. Only the former
shows continued activity (and uses the
Trojan RTM).

Trickbot is the only Trojan to have
significantly evolved over the last year:
• new module for collecting passwords
from installed applications;
• ability to steal RDP, VNC, and
PuTTY data as well as configuration
files from SYSVOL directories
on domain controllers;

• fileless attacks and use of Mimikatz;
• no module and configuration file
download to disk (Windows 10);
• mail-outs from compromised
computers;
• new cookie stealer.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

Some experts have singled out the group
Grim Spider. It uses Trickbot for network
reconnaissance purposes to then load
the Ryuk ransomware and demand sums
exceeding $100,000 for decrypting the
victim’s device.

15

Autofill and fake push notifications in banking Trojans for Android
In the past, money was stolen from bank
accounts mainly by displaying fake
windows where bank card, login, and
password details were to be entered.
Transaction confirmation codes were
obtained by intercepting SMS messages.
The year 2019 saw the appearance
of Trojans that automatically transfer
money via mobile banking apps, i.e. the
autofill feature.

The year 2019 saw the appearance of the
most advanced Android Trojans, which
were developed in order to be rented out.
Their price ranges from $800 to $2,000
per month.
Owners of banking botnets began
devoting more attention to self-defense
and sanbox bypassing methods.

15 Trojans
fell out of use; the codes of seven
Trojans were adapted for modern
Android OS; five new Trojans entered
the market

Push notifications were thought

the Accessibility Service to manipulate
push notifications, copy their text, and
activate certain areas.
The US managed to make the authors
of Android Trojans prohibit the use
of their malware in the States, not just
in Russia and other post-Soviet countries.

FORECAST: GRADUAL REPLACEMENT OF TROJANS BY JS SNIFFERS AND CHANGES TO METHODS OF SOCIAL
ENGINEERING AND PHISHING DISTRIBUTION
Phishing and social engineering will
remain the biggest threat to online
banking customers. There may be a shift
from email to text message as the main
distribution channel for phishing links.
The owners of DDoS botnets built
on numerous infected routers may start
renting them out to hackers who engage
in phishing. Phishing is usually more
profitable than DDoS attacks.
Schemes involving remote support
through remote access tools will shift
from PCs to mobile devices. They will
have one of two goals: to obtain bank
card information from the customer
or to request payment for fake services
(e.g. security checks, removing threats
from devices).

The number of active banking Trojans for
PCs will decrease except in Brazil, where
threats are developing locally. Moreover,
their geographical scope will shrink due
to the integration of security tools and
markedly reduced financial benefits for
attackers.
Today, malware writers develop the
autofill feature for Android Trojans
on their own. If a universal solution for
mobile Trojans is created (as was the case
with Zeus), then such attacks will become
significantly more popular. However, this
is unlikely to happen within a year.

Trojans for PC and Android. That said, the
threat will mainly affect countries where
the 3D Secure system is not widely used.
POS Trojans will not undergo significant
changes. They will continue to be used
mainly in attacks on retailers in the
US and, to a lesser extent, in Spanishspeaking countries.

JS sniffers will be the most rapidly
evolving threat; they make attackers
more money than banking Trojans. There
are already more JS sniffers than banking

Overt military operations in cyberspace

Incident in Iran has once again
confirmed the suggestion
that the critical infrastructure
of many countries has already been
compromised, but attackers remain
unnoticed until they act.

In 2019, cybersecurity became a heavily
debated topic in politics. The activities
of cyber armies and the rhetoric
of political leaders around cyberattacks
continue to gain momentum.
March 2019, Venezuela. Sabotage
at the Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant,
also known as the Guri Dam, resulted
in a mass-scale blackout in Caracas
and 22 of all 23 states in the country.
According to TASS, a news agency, the
country’s Communications Minister said
there had been “a cyberattack against
the automated control system”. The
plant was shut down in response to the
attack. Unlike other well-known attacks
on energy companies, this is the first time
that a large part of a country was left
without electricity for several days.

All these cases show that cyberspace
is becoming a battlefield. This trend could
lead to new cyberattacks on military and
government systems in order to disrupt
their work, cause social and economic
damage, and destabilize countries.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

May 5, 2019, Palestine. According
to Israeli sources, on May 4, 2019,
hackers from the militant group Hamas
tried to carry out a cyberattack. Israel
declined to reveal the incident details.
To counter the attack, the Israel Defense
Forces launched an airstrike on a building
in the Gaza Strip, where the hackers
headquarters is believed to have been
located.
June 2019, Iran. On June
20, 2019, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) shot down
a US drone. The US retaliated a few
days later by launching a cyberattack
on IRGC's missile control systems. Such
an attack requires months of preparation,
which suggests that the systems had
been compromised prior to that.

Disruption of Internet infrastructures,
which nearly all government and private
organizations depend on, is becoming
a dangerous attack vector. The sections
below look at scenarios that have
already been tested and could be used
on a larger scale at government level
in the next year.

DNS HIJACKING AND ATTACKS ON DOMAIN NAME REGISTRARS
The DNS protocol underpins the World
Wide Web and hackers who gain control
over it can be extremely dangerous.
Moreover, carrying out operations using
this protocol does not require having
access to DNS servers.
There are two possible scenarios when
purchasing a domain name:
• either the domain registrar
provides DNS server services;
• or the registrar provides a domain
name only, with DNS servers being
run by a different provider.
In either scenario, each customer can
specify the following information in their
personal account on the domain name
registrar’s website:
• what DNS servers will be responsible
for a particular domain name;
• what IP addresses the traffic will
be sent to when there is a request
to access the resources related
to this domain name.
This means that by compromising
a particular domain name registrar,
threat actors can manipulate all domains
registered through that registrar. The
situation is made worse by the fact
that countries usually have only a few
major registrars, which service both
government and private organizations.

of the country. If such an attack were
to be conducted in combination with
sabotage activities, restoring the
registrar’s stability and recovering their
configuration would be impossible. The
resulting situation would damage all
industries without exception.
In addition to individual registrars,
attackers could target organizations
that manage country code top-level
domains. Almost every country has this
type of organization. For instance, the
Singapore Network Information Centre
(SGNIC) Pte Ltd is responsible for
Singapore’s domain zone .sg.
Domain name registrars and
organizations responsible for root
domain services have become a new
priority for threat actors. Information
security experts detected several such
incidents in 2019.
The attacks described above
were successful and targeted
individual organizations in both
the government and private
sectors. If threat actors become
set on disrupting national
infrastructures, attacks like these will
have much wider consequences.

DNS infrastructure
could fall victim to
a successful attack
at all levels
12.14.2018 – 1.2.2019
Netnod, a Swedish company that was
the first to manage root name servers
and provide DNS services (there are
only 12 organizations of this kind in
the world), suffered a series of attacks
between December 14, 2018 and
January 2, 2019. The attackers were able
to manipulate DNS records for MITM
attacks targeting specific customers.[1]

APRIL 2019
the owners of the domain names
.gr and .ελ were notified that the
Institute of Computer Science of
the Foundation for Research and
Technology (FORTH-IC), which is
responsible for technical support and
use of domains in these zones, fell
victim to an attack. Users were asked
to urgently change their passwords for
authorization.[2]

Simultaneously hacking several
main registrars will paralyze website,
mail, and DNS servers, as well as all
services connected to them, for most

BGP HIJACKING AND ATTACKS ON INTERNET ROUTING SYSTEMS
Another fundamental routing protocol
is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
The idea behind BGP hijacking
is to redirect the network traffic
of certain prefixes of an autonomous
system (IP address pools) through the
threat actor’s equipment. The most
common objective of such attacks
is cyberespionage.
However, network routes can also
be manipulated to disrupt major
telecommunications companies. There
have been many major, publicly shared
incidents (although they were a result
of either human error or misconfiguration
rather than targeted attacks).

NOVEMBER 25, 2018
Krek Ltd, a small-scale Russian
operator, made a mistake in its BGP
configuration, causing 10-20% of
Russian Internet users to lose access
to thousands of services. The failure
lasted for more than an hour and
affected major companies such as
Amazon, YouTube, VK (Russian social
network), ivi.ru (online video streaming
service), and many others.[1]

NOVEMBER 2018

BGP ROV

MainOne, a Nigerian Internet service
provider, made a configuration mistake
and changed routes in such a way that
traffic to Google services was directed
through China, where it was getting
dropped. A total of 180 prefixes were
affected. It took 74 minutes to fix the
issue after it was detected. During this
time, some Google users experienced
access problems.[2]

The new BGP Route Origin Validation
(ROV) standard is now part of the
BGP protocol security package,
along with BGP Resource Public Key
Infrastructure (RPKI) and BGP Path
Validation (BGPsec). BGP ROV allows
routers to use BGP RPKI information
to filter out unauthorized route
advertisements and prevent BGP
from being intercepted by attackers
intending to redirect traffic from
legitimate servers to malicious ones.
Experts say the problem was that the
BGP attribute they used caused a
crash in the software of the routers
based on FRRouting (FRR)—a set of IP
protocols for Linux and Unix.

JUNE 6, 2019
the Swiss company Safe Host (AS21217)
caused a leak of 70,000 routes to
China Telecom (AS4134). The most
heavily affected were Swisscom
(AS3303) based in Switzerland, KPN
(AS1136) based in the Netherlands,
and Bouygues Telecom (AS5410) and
Numericable-SFR (AS21502) based
in France. The incident lasted for two
hours.[3]

Another noteworthy example is a 2019
experiment, the aim of which was
to analyze new BGP security features.
It culminated in the failure of routers
of Internet service providers in Asia and
Australia.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

The cases described above show
that manipulating traffic does not
require access to the targeted
company’s network hardware. Access
to an area border router is enough
to be able to change the BGP
configuration.
So far, BGP hijacking has had large-scale
but short-term effects. For prolonged
sabotage, threat actors will need to have
both access to the network routers
of several operators as well as preprepared scenarios for manipulating
traffic. In such cases, BGP hijacking could
cause significant network congestion
in some countries (similar to what
happens in energy company networks).

ATTACKS ON LOCAL SYSTEMS OF FILTERING
AND BLOCKING TRAFFIC
Some countries have implemented
or are creating filtering systems that
analyze and block certain user traffic.
Such technological solutions facilitate
attacks aimed at blocking the operation
of a network in a particular country.
The attacks summarized below have
been tested by threat actors and may
be conducted on a larger scale in the
future.

Blacklisted resources
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) block
access to harmful websites (terroristrelated, malicious, linked to drug
trafficking, etc.) based on blacklists. The
lists consist of domains, IP addresses, and
links. They are constantly updated so that
malicious resource owners cannot bypass
restrictions.
In cases where operators cannot
deploy DPI (Deep Packet Inspection)
systems, they must restrict traffic based
on IP addresses. Knowing this, attackers

[1]

leverage blacklisted domains to block
legitimate resources. Owners of banned
websites list the IP address of a legitimate
webpage in their DNS information, which
leads to providers blocking the legitimate
site. If a blacklisted domain name has
a new legitimate IP, it will automatically
be blocked by the provider.
Since 2017, attackers in Russia have used
this technique to bring down Wikipedia
as well as banking and government
resources. In March 2019, a similar
attack was carried out against the users
of Yandex, a Russian search engine.
This is an easy and cheap way to conduct
cyberattacks. Companies can protect
themselves by introducing a whitelist
of critical resources that must never
be blocked. However, blacklists are
distributed in a centralized manner.
If an attacker gains access to the server
distributing these lists, they will be able
to add any subnet to it.

Traffic decryption
Usually, transmitted content
is encrypted, so some countries
require users to install governmentissued certificates. Once installed, the
certificate helps local government
agencies decrypt user traffic.
Such certificates are issued
by designated centers. Banning
certificates by browser and operating
system would affect all users who have
these certificates installed.
This happened to DarkMatter, a UAEbased cybersecurity company. Google
announced plans to ban root certificates
owned by DarkMatter from Chrome
and Android. Mozilla also announced
that its browser Firefox would not trust
certificates from DarkMatter. In August
2019, Google and Mozilla blocked
a Kazakh government–issued root
certificate used for intercepting traffic.

Throughout the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, security experts identified numerous previously unknown statesponsored groups. Many have been conducting operations for several years and have gone unnoticed for a long time. Some groups
attack similar targets, which leads to competition between them and means that their actions are detected quicker.

The cyberespionage group WindShift has been flying under the radar for many years thanks to its
distinctive feature—thorough attack preparation.
The attackers created fake user pages on social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
and Google Plus) and sent friendly messages to potential victims. The interactions lasted from
six months to a year, during which the attackers tricked their victims into divulging valuable
information.
The group mainly targets employees of government agencies and critical infrastructure facilities
in the Middle East. Victims' macOS systems were attacked using crafted malicious programs: OSX.
WindTail.A, OSX.WindTail.B, and OSX.WindTape.

The group Blue Mushroom (aka Sapphire Mushroom, APT-C-12) has been operating since 2011
but only became known in mid-2018.
Its attacks involve cloud infrastructure. For example, the group uses Amazon S3 and cloud server
communication protocols to exfiltrate confidential user information.
The attackers also use the Digital Ocean cloud service as C&C and the SinaAppEngine (SAE)
service to create their own C&C infrastructure.

In the fall of 2018, reports revealed a newly discovered sophisticated APT framework, TajMahal.
It has been used for at least 5 years, but it remains unclear to which group the tool belongs.
The framework consists of two packages named Tokyo and Yokohama and contains around
80 malicious modules. The tool is designed to conduct cyberespionage campaigns, but the list
of confirmed victims only contains one: a diplomatic entity from a country in Central Asia.

SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS
Last year’s Group-IB Hi-Tech Crime
Trends report identified BIOS/UEFI
attacks as one of the most prominent
trends. Experts predicted that the
main targets would likely be firmware
and motherboard developers based
mainly in the APAC region, where
large companies have their production
facilities.

Winnti attacks on hardware
manufacturers and game
developers
A few months after Group-IB's report was
released, its prediction was confirmed
by news about a malware campaign
called Operation ShadowHammer.[1]
To deliver malware, attackers leveraged
the legitimate utility ASUS Live
Update, which automatically updates
components such as BIOS, UEFI, drivers,
and applications.
The trojanized utility was signed with
the legitimate certificate “ASUSTeK
Computer Inc.” and was hosted on the
official ASUS server.
Similar malware delivery techniques
were used to infect software belonging
to three other manufacturers, whose
names were not disclosed. The attacks,
conducted for espionage purposes, are
linked to the Chinese group Winnti.

In addition to equipment manufacturers,
the same group successfully attacked
the gaming industry. In total, two games
and one gaming platform were infected.
One of the affected gaming companies
is located in Thailand.

Plead (aka BlackTech) campaigns:
Focus on Taiwan
In July 2018, cybersecurity experts
discovered a new malware campaign
involving the Plead backdoor, which
was digitally signed using a valid D-Link
Corporation code-signing certificate.
At the end of April 2019, the experts
identified multiple attempts to deploy
the same malware in an unusual way.
The Plead backdoor was created and
executed by a legitimate process named
AsusWSPanel.exe. The executable file
was digitally signed by ASUS Cloud
Corporation. Plead malware has always
been most widely deployed in Taiwan.

Chinese group attacks through
Hewlett Packard (HP) and IBM
In December 2018, Chinese attackers
reportedly infiltrated the networks
of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)
and IBM as part of the Cloudhopper
campaign. By gaining access to the
networks, they were subsequently able
to hack into computers belonging to HPE
and IBM clients.
Cloudhopper compromised client
data in 12 countries, including Brazil,
Germany, India, Japan, the United Arab
Emirates, Great Britain, and the United
States. The clients were from industries
such as finance, electronics, medical
equipment, biotechnology, automotive,
mining, and oil and gas.

In 2019, an attack on an international
vendor of development tools for various
programming languages was discovered.

HACKING BACK
“Hacking back” is a controversial method
that helps victims of cyberattacks take
a more proactive approach to deterring
cyberthreats. The question of whether
private companies can legally conduct
such operations has been discussed for
years. Today, hacking back is allowed only
in the case of national security services.
In 2019, there were more instances when
information about tools used by attackers
was made public as part of retaliatory
attacks.
In March 2019, the Telegram channel
Lab Dookhtegan posted tool source
codes used by the Iranian group OilRig
(APT34) and data about its members.
The information included the identities
of hacked victims as well as the
names, surnames, and social media
profiles of supposedly active group
members, including leaders. A user
with the nickname "Lab Dookhtegan"
claims to be a former member
of OilRig and to have worked on the
group's DNSpionage campaign.

variant of Mimikatz—which is unique
to Turla (Russia)—to the victim’s device.
As occurred in the OilRig (APT34)
case, a Telegram channel was used
to leak data about another Iran-nexus
group, MuddyWater. The data leaked
included information about the source
code of a tool written in Python and its
C&C servers.
This tool is designed to generate
a payload embedded in a macro.
Once the macro is executed, the
victim's computer connects to the
C&C server and downloads additional
modules. This tool also delivers a secondstage payload, e.g. .sct, .hta, and
PowerShell.

Alto Networks called TwoFace);

BLACKCOFFEE

• HighShell (another web shell);

CHINACHOP

• Fox Panel (a phishing kit);
• Webmask (the main tool involved
in the DNSpionage campaign).
Published data about 66 victims was
collected in some of APT34's backend
command-and-control (C&C) servers
and contained credentials from internal
servers and user IP addresses. This victim
list mainly includes companies and
organizations in the Middle East, Africa,
East Asia, and Europe.

In August 2018, the group Intrusion Truth
revealed the identities of individuals
it claimed were members of the Chinese
hacking group APT10. In July 2019, the
same group shared details of individuals
thought to be members of the Chinabacked group APT17.
In August 2019, FireEye released an indepth report about the APT41 group
during the BlackHat conference. APT41
seems to have several ties with APT17,
which is why experts believe that these
threat actors are in fact the same group
(called Winnti or BARIUM).

The published hacking tools include:

• PoisonFrog (an old version
of BondUpdater);

In June 2018, the United States imposed
sanctions against the Russian research
institute Quantum, a contractor for
FSB, the Russian intelligence service.
In December 2018, the group Digital
Revolution published data stolen from
Quantum. In July 2019, hackers breached
SyTech, another FSB contractor, and
shared the exfiltrated data about
the company’s internal projects and
screenshots of SyTech's servers with
Digital Revolution. The latter released
this information online.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
new challenges and threats
TELECOM-RELATED TARGETING
The telecom industry is a key target
for state-sponsored attackers.
If they manage to compromise
a telecommunications company,
attackers then have the opportunity
to also compromise its customers for
surveillance or sabotage purposes.

APT10
One of the most large-scale operations
during the reporting period was an attack
called Operation Soft Cell, allegedly
conducted by the Chinese statesponsored group APT10. The campaign
has been active since at least 2012.
The purpose of the attack was to obtain
CDR records belonging to a large
telecommunications provider. The
hackers were able to compromise
usernames and passwords as well
as billing data, detailed call records,
credentials, mail servers, user location,
and more.
The attack started with deploying
a modified version of the China Chopper
web shell on a vulnerable server. The
attackers leveraged the Windows
process w3wp.exe, which runs web
applications and is responsible for
requests sent to a web server.
The attackers used stolen credentials
to create fraudulent domain user
accounts with extensive administrator
privileges. They then used these
accounts or deployed the Poison Ivy
RAT to maintain access to compromised
resources.

APT33 (aka Elfin, Magnallium)

HEXANE

In late 2018, APT33 (aka Elfin,
Magnallium) resumed its attacks using
a new variant of the Shamoon Trojan.
The tool’s first version was discovered
in 2012; the second version, together
with the wave of attacks during which
it was used, were discovered in 2017.
Shamoon-3 overwrites the master boot
record (MBR), partitions, and files in the
system with random data.

The newly discovered group HEXANE
attacks telecommunications companies
in the Middle East, Central Asia, and
Africa as a stepping stone in supply
chain attacks. Its goal is to gain access
to critical infrastructure belonging to the
organizations that use the services
of these telecom companies.

The updated tool’s first victim was
Saipem S.p.A., an Italian oil and gas
industry contractor. The Shamoon wiper
was also detected in attacks on oil,
gas, telecommunications, and energy
companies as well as government
organizations in the Middle East and
Southern Europe..

Chafer (aka APT39)
The goal of the group Chafer (aka
APT39) is to collect personal data for
further user monitoring and tracking
operations in support of Iranian national
interests. The collected data can also
be used as a vector for further attacks.
For initial compromise, the group
leverages spear-phishing emails with
malicious attachments or URLs, usually
resulting in a POWBAT infection. The
group identifies and exploits vulnerable
web servers belonging to targeted
organizations in order to install web
shells (e.g. ANTAK and ASPXSPY)
and uses stolen legitimate credentials
to compromise externally facing Outlook
Web Access (OWA) resources.

Lazarus
The group Lazarus also spies
on telecommunications companies using
a new backdoor called Rising Sun. The
latter collects data about the infected
device, such as IP address, network
device information, OS name and
version, system data, and username. The
collected data is sent to the C&C server.
This backdoor is probably spread as the
first attack stage and may be followed
by a download of additional malware.

Thrip
The Chinese hacker group Thrip is known
for espionage and sabotage attacks.
In particular, they target organizations
in the satellite communications sector.
The hackers use the “living off the
land” technique, which involves using
operating system features or legitimate
network administration tools (PsExec,
Mimikatz, WinSCP, and LogMeIn)
to compromise victims’ networks with
Trojans.

MuddyWater
The state-sponsored group MuddyWater
gained access to the local network
of Korek Telecom, a mobile operator
based in Erbil, Iraq. Compromising the
operator was an intermediate stage
in an attack on the oil and gas company
Missan Oil Company, which is supposedly
a client of Korek Telecom.

5G EXPANSION–RELATED CHALLENGES
Investigations into 5G
vulnerabilities

The 5G standardization process is not
scheduled to be completed until 2021,
but the first networks have already been
built. Moreover, active competition
currently exists not only between
technology giants, but also countries
(USA and China are leading in the field
of 5G).

New challenges and security issues
linked to 5G networks are worrying
experts worldwide. In the past year,
several studies on this topic have been
published:
• In November 2018, a team
of researchers from Switzerland,
France, and the United Kingdom
raised concerns about the
5G protocol known as Authentication
and Key Agreement (AKA).

Pioneers will set the standards and
practices that will be implemented
by subsequent players. This will
both bring leading countries billions
in revenue, create new jobs, and offer
leadership opportunities in technological
innovation, as was the case when the
2/3/4G networks appeared.

5G architectural risks
The main feature of 5G (unlike 1/2/3/4G)
is that it is more of a software than
a hardware platform. The equipment
used in traditional mobile communication
networks has been replaced with
software entities operating in data
centers on standard servers and virtual
machines. In addition to virtual machines,
software containers and the software
architecture of microservices will be used
to implement software functions.
It is these architectural features that
concern security professionals. All threats
to server and software solutions are
now becoming relevant for 5G network
operators.

• In February 2019, a group of university
researchers discovered cellular
network vulnerabilities that impact
both 4G and 5G LTE protocols.
According to the paper, the new
attack method could allow remote
attackers to bypass security
protections implemented in 4G and
5G, re-enabling IMSI catching devices
(such as "Stingrays") to intercept
phone calls and track user location.
• ToRPEDO ("TRacking via Paging
mEssage DistributiOn) is the
most dangerous attack leveraging
the cellular paging protocol.
It allows remote attackers to verify
a victim’s coarse-grained location
information, inject fabricated paging
messages, and mount denial-ofservice attacks. ToRPEDO is effective
against 4G and 5G LTE protocols.

Experts tested ToRPEDO against
three Canadian service providers
and all US service providers.
• The PIERCER (Persistent Information
Exposure by the Core Network)
attack allows hackers to link the
victim's IMSI to their phone number.

New scale of traditional threats
Wider adoption of 5G will significantly
increase the number of traditional
attacks that providers have faced
in recent years:
• DDoS attacks will become much
more frequent and effective due
to the large number of insecure
devices and wide bandwidth.
• Proxying is another popular scam
method. By turning compromised
devices into proxies, hackers can
use a large pool of IP addresses
to attack. This helps them bypass
security systems to carry out web
scraping, automated fraud, and traffic
cheats. Connecting IoT devices
to 5G networks will significantly
increase the number of insecure
devices that may be used for proxying.
• The spread of malware through hacked
devices is a popular practice, which
will become more large-scale with
the development of 5G networks.

Increased attack surface when
infrastructure is compromised
Network slicing is a form of virtualization
that allows multiple logical networks
to run on top of a shared physical network
infrastructure. This approach is used
to provide various types of 5G services:
web or voice traffic transfer, traffic for
augmented reality applications, etc.
Access to such network slices is obtained
by companies seeking to provide
5G-based services. Although the
address pool is logically isolated,
access to it increases the attack surface
significantly, which could compromise
the entire infrastructure.
APT groups could start using
network slicing to conduct BIOS/
UEFI-related attacks, side channel
attacks, or supply chain attacks.
The goals of state-sponsored
hackers are likely to be espionage
or sabotage in order to undermine trust
in a competitor’s solution.

BGP HIJACKING AND SS7 THREATS
Exploitation of SS7 vulnerabilities for
espionage and fraud purposes has long
been known and continues to be used.
In January 2019, UK-based Metro Bank
customers fell victim to a 2FA bypass
attack. Hackers exploited a vulnerability
in the SS7 protocol to target bank
accounts by intercepting text messages
used as two-factor authentication.
Several examples of BGP hijacking were
listed at the beginning of this report, but
there have been many more incidents
of this nature.

Shut down of the "BGP hijack
factory" – Portuguese provider
Bitcanal
On June 25, 2018, independent
security researcher Ronald Guilmette
discovered suspicious activity associated
with multiple BGP hijacks. The BGP
hijacked routes were carried out by the
Portuguese provider Bitcanal. When
presented with the most recent evidence
of hijacks, transit providers immediately
disconnected Bitcanal as a customer and
deprived it of international transit.
During a BGP hijack, Bitcanal announced
subnets belonging to Beijing Jingdong
360 Degree E-commerce. The
Portuguese provider’s loss of transit also
resulted in the disconnection of Routed
Solutions (AS39536), presumably
Bitcanal’s customer or one of its affiliated
companies.

BGP/DNS hijacks targeting the
payment systems WorldPay,
Datawire, and Vantiv
On July 6, 2018, the provider Digital
Wireless Indonesia (AS38146)
announced the following prefixes for
about 30 minutes:
64.243.142.0/24 – Savvis,
64.57.150.0/24 – Vantiv, LLC,
64.57.154.0/24 – Vantiv, LLC,
69.46.100.0/24 – Q9 Networks Inc.,
216.220.36.0/24 – Q9 Networks Inc.
On July 10, 2018, Malaysian operator
Extreme Broadband (AS38182)
announced the exact same five prefixes
listed above for 30 minutes. An hour later,
they were announced again for about
15 minutes.
On July 11, 2018, Malaysian operator
Extreme Broadband (AS38182) began
announcing a new set of prefixes:

209.235.25.0/24 – Mercury Payment
Systems, 63.111.40.0/24 – Mercury
Payment Systems, 8.25.204.0/24 –
Level 3, 12.130.236.0/24 –CERFnet
On 12 July 2018, AS38182 began
hijacking the same five routes that had
been targeted twice previously.
64.243.142.0/24 – Savvis,
64.57.150.0/24 – Vantiv, LLC,
64.57.154.0/24 – Vantiv, LLC,
69.46.100.0/24 – Q9 Networks Inc.,
216.220.36.0/24 – Q9 Networks Inc.
This time, the hijack lasted much longer
than in the previous cases: the provider
announced the prefixes to intercept
traffic for almost three hours.
An hour later, AS38182 began hijacking
various routes for approximately
10 minutes:
199.7.68.0/24 – UltraDNS Corporation,
199.7.69.0/24 – UltraDNS Corporation,
204.74.108.0/24 – UltraDNS Corp,
204.74.109.0/24 – Internet Media
Network, 204.74.114.0/24 – Internet
Media Network, 204.74.115.0/24 –
InternetMediaNetwork,65.118.49.0/24 –
CenturyLink
These Internet routing attacks were
presumably designed to redirect
traffic directed at payment processors
to servers controlled by malicious
actors who would then attempt to steal
the data. Passive DNS observations
between the July 10 and 13 showed
*.datawire.net domains resolving
to 45.227.252.17 (AS58271, VSERVERAS, Panama).

In 2017, China Telecom intercepted traffic
between Scandinavia and Japan that
crossed the United States and redirected
it to a mail server operated by a large
Thai financial company. According to the
authors, after China Telecom copied the
data for encryption breaking and analysis,
traffic was delivered to the intended
networks within a short time.

Attack on public DNS servers
in Taiwan
On May 15, 2019, researchers
reported that BGP routes had been
hijacked to intercept traffic going
through a public DNS run by the
Taiwan Network Information Center
(TWNIC). On May 8, 2019, traffic was
rerouted to the network belonging
to the Brazilian provider Fibra Plus
Telecomunicacoes LTDA (AS268869).
The incident lasted three and a half
minutes. On May 8, the Brazilian provider
(AS268869) started advertising the
prefix 101.101.101.0/24, which does not
belong to it—the move was an attempt
to hijack the Quad101 prefix. Quad101
is an experimental Public DNS project
run by TWNIC, a ccTLD (country-code
Top Level Domain) registry operator.

Multiple cases of traffic
misdirection by China Telecom
A joint paper from the U.S. Naval
College and Tel Aviv University (Israel)
claims that China Telecom, a Chinese
telecommunications company, has
systematically hijacked Internet traffic for
years by exploiting BGP weaknesses.
One example cited by the authors
is route diversions between Canadian
and South Korean government websites.
In 2016, internet traffic was diverted
by China Telecom and routed through its
PoP (point of presence) in Toronto, then
forwarded to its PoP on the West Coast
of the United States, followed by China
and finally South Korea.

ENERGY SECTOR
state-sponsored groups

In the energy sector, threat actors usually carry out attacks for espionage purposes. Yet in some cases, critical infrastructure facilities
were shut down.

have attack tools and experience: Iran,
Russia, and North Korea

Stuxnet, Dugu, Flame, and the attack
on Venezuela confirm that the most
dangerous threats have not yet been
identified

is a testing ground for tools used in
attacks on energy organizations from the
times of Stuxnet up until now

ENERGY SECTOR–ORIENTED GROUPS
HEXANE

Xenotime

BlackEnergy

In 2018, a new group called HEXANE
was discovered. Its members focus
on industrial control systems and attack
oil and gas companies in the Middle East
(mainly Kuwait). The threat actors bypass
security tools through trusted vendors
by compromising the software and
telecommunications networks belonging
to their targets.

In 2018, the hacking group Xenotime
also switched to power grids. The
group became known for its malware
called Triton (aka Trisis), which has
been used for attacks on Schneider
Electric’s Triconex Safety Instrumented
System (SIS) controllers.

BlackEnergy is one of the most advanced
energy sector–oriented groups and
has caused disruptions in energy
organizations more than once. The
group focuses on ICS/SCADA systems
worldwide. The most damaging incident
occurred in late 2015, when an attack
disrupted electric power supply
in a region in Ukraine.

LeafMiner
LeafMiner hackers, believed to be based
in Iran, use both publicly known tools
(such as Inception Framework) and
self-developed programs (Trojan.
Imecab and Backdoor.Sorgu according
to Symantec’s classification). The
group’s main targets are located in the
Middle East.
LeafMiner uses watering hole attacks
to infiltrate targeted organizations. The
threat actors embed malicious links
into compromised websites to establish
an SMB connection and steal Windows
credentials. Based on security analyst
observations, LeafMiner does not
disrupt ICS when gaining initial access
to organizations’ credentials.

It was later found that Xenotime had
improved its malware and that its new
version could be used to attack various
industrial safety systems. These are
separate safety mechanisms that are
activated to help manage industrial
processes if they approach unsafe
conditions such as over-pressurization,
overspeed, or over-heating.

Lazarus
On September 23, it was reported
that the hacking group Lazarus had
developed a new set of tools, which were
used in attacks on Indian companies
between late 2018 and the spring
of 2019. The threat actors successfully
compromised the account belonging
to a senior employee at the headquarters
of a nuclear organization in the APAC
region.
Although the aforementioned
groups were active in the period
investigated , two already known
groups, BlackEnergy and Dragonfly,
should not be overlooked. The
hackers redeveloping their tools and
techniques for new attacks could
explain the lull in their activity.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

Industroyer, also known
as CRASHOVERRIDE, remains the
main tool used by the hackers. The tool
gains control over remote terminal units
(RTU) that manage switches and circuit
breakers at power grid substations.
The group added BadRabbit and
VPNFilter to its arsenal in 2017 and 2018,
respectively. The latter is designed for
attacks on routers and contains a module
for detecting SCADA systems.

Dragonfly
The group Dragonfly, believed
to be sponsored by Russia, focuses
on collecting data from energy and
industrial facilities. The threat actors
use phishing emails to attack individual
employees and watering hole attacks
for larger-scale thefts of corporate
credentials. Dragonfly’s arsenal also
includes tools such as Goodor, DorShel,
and Karagany.

Geographical scope
Silence is one of the most actively
developing threat groups at large.
When the group first started, it used
Russia as a testing ground to prepare for
worldwide expansion.
• First half of 2018: main activity and
first successful attacks in Russia.
• Fall of 2018: first mass attacks
in other countries, mainly in the
Middle East and South-East Asia.
• February 2019: activity in Russia
drastically declined. Silence shifts
their focus to the financial sectors
in Bulgaria, India, Bangladesh,
Chile, Costa Rica and Ghana.

In mid-2019, SIlence purchased
access to banks from TA505.
Group‑IB confirmed this fact while
conducting an incident response
operation in a Bulgarian bank. Silence
will most likely abandon mail-outs and
continue using the services of other
threat groups.

Tools
The main tool Silence uses is their
own framework, named Silence after
the group. In late 2018, the hackers
revamped their loader called Ivoke,
which:
• became fileless (written in PowerShell);

• Forecast for the second half
of 2019 and 2020: the group may
significantly expand the geographical
scope of their attacks by working
together with other threat actors.
In particular, Group‑IB’s incident
response operations in a number
of banks revealed that Silence has
already started paying another
hacking group (TA505) for
installing its Trojan in banks.

• learned how to bypass detection
solutions more effectively;

Theft method

• had the protocol for communicating
with the C&C server changed

Silence’s recent targets were
ATMs, on which the group installed
a new version of an ATM Trojan
and gained remote access to the
machine’s dispenser.
It is worth noting that the threat actors
have experience in stealing money
through bank card management systems,
which may have been successfully
applied during the attack on the
Dutch‑Bangla Bank and banks in Russia
before that.

Penetration method
The group’s only method of breaching
a bank’s security lies in carefully
prepared, but not targeted, phishing
emails. The preliminary stage of a Silence
attack is characterized by “recon”
emails without any malicious content.
This helps create an up-to-date list
of email addresses and find out what
cybersecurity solutions the targeted
organization uses. Phishing emails with
a malicious payload are then sent to the
updated list of email addresses.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

• started to collect data on targeted
systems more actively to help make
decisions on whether it is worth
pursuing the attack;
• had commands pointing
to Russian words deleted;
• was fitted with a new feature for
transferring files from the infected
system to the C&C server;

The group continues to use Silence.Proxy
to proxy traffic. In addition, the threat
actors employ other remote control
tools, such as DarkVNC and a modified
version of AmmyAdmin, which has been
dubbed FlawedAmmyy. This is a fullfledged remote access Trojan (RAT),
which enables the threat actors to gain
administrative control over infected
devices in order to monitor user activity,
profile the system, and steal credentials.
Silence is not the only group that uses
FlawedAmmyy. In particular, hackers
from TA505 have used it in recent
attacks.
In the past, Silence used only its own
unique Trojan called Atmosphere.
In 2019, however, the group started using
new malware. After successfully testing
it on IT Bank (Russia), the new tool was
presumably used for theft at DutchBangla Bank (Bangladesh).

More information
on Cobalt is
available in
Group-IB’s
technical report

Cobalt’s last successful theft in Russia
was observed in November 2018. It was
not until July 2019 that the group
resumed their attempts to breach
Russian banks. In the meantime, the
threat actors focused on other countries.
They sent out phishing emails disguised
as messages from the European
Banking Federation, Diebold Nixdorf,
the Interkassa e-payment system, SEPA
Europe, and SWIFT.
It is worth highlighting the mail-outs
purporting to be from banks in Europe,
Greece, India, and Kazakhstan: they
were sent from the mail servers
belonging to the targeted organizations,
which suggests that either the banks
or employee email accounts had been
compromised.
Despite the mail-outs and other traces
of activity, there is no publicly available
information about thefts that Cobalt
committed outside Russia. This indicates
that there are no informatory procedures
in place in the regions attacked rather
than that there are no attacks.

Penetration method
To breach infrastructures, Cobalt
engages in phishing by posing as banks,
financial organizations, and their
partners. After successfully attacking
a bank, the threat actors sometimes
continue using the access they gained
to send phishing emails under the
victim’s name and from the entity’s mail
servers.

In January 2019, Cobalt started using
a new scheme to spread their malware.
The group sent emails using free email
services and posing as individuals who
are well known in financial circles.
Another important email-related
change was higher quality. Earlier texts
were poorly phrased and had no decoy
documents attached, but during
recent attacks the emails looked much
more trustworthy and the malicious
attachments contained clever baits.

Theft method
In 2018, the threat group used various
theft methods: SWIFT, local interbank
transfer systems, card processing, and
the payment gateways of instant money
transfer systems. Interestingly, only
Cobalt has experience in using payment
gateways for theft, which they only did
in Russia.

Tools
First, the targeted company is infected
with the modular backdoor CobInt.
It launches other modules that collect
system information and download and
launch the main tool for developing the
attack further. Its main tool is still Cobalt
Strike, which the group has been using
since it started its activity.
Another tool that Cobalt has been using
is a JS backdoor that downloads and
launches PE files and executes scripts.
As for Cobalt’s Trojans for Windows,
Linux, and ATMs, they were not used
in the period investigated.

In October 2018, Group-IB detected
an attack carried out from the
subdomains of a governmental portal
in Russia, which redirected users
to servers using the RIG Exploit Kit.
As a result, CobaltStrike Beacon was
installed on the victim’s computer. It was
later established that this attack resulted
in a theft from a bank in a post-Soviet
country.

Theft method

In 2018 and 2019, MoneyTaker was
observed to be active only in Russia.
Initially, its activity had been detected
due to their attacks in the US. At the time,
the group had remained unnoticed for
many years.

MoneyTaker steals money through
the Russian interbank transfer system
or ATMs using a self-developed ATM
Trojan, which was created in 2018 and
designed to remotely control ATM
dispensers. The threat actors grew more
cautious with the former method; they
abandoned automation tools and now
carry out transactions manually instead.

ATM trojan
ARM CBR

Penetration method

Initial infection

1. Vulnerable network equipment.
Once the threat actors gain access
to it, they use a VPN to add their
server to the bank’s local network
and develop the attack further using
that server. This vector is very difficult
to detect, which is why it took experts
a long time to determine how exactly
MoneyTaker penetrated networks.

MoneyTaker uses three main methods for
penetrating networks:

Phishing
Network vulnerability
Supply chain

Tools
Metasploit
ATM trojan
MTHole.VBE
VNC
Mimikatz
MBR Killer

Tools
Metasploit remains MoneyTaker’s main
tool; the group has been using it since
the beginning. The threat actors also
employ another popular framework
called PowerSploit, as well as Radmin
for remote control and a self-developed
ATM Trojan for theft from ATMs.

2. Access to a trusted partner’s networks
by brute forcing the passwords
of local administrators, with
further attack development.

SilentCards is a new local threat group
based in Kenya. So far, it has attacked
targets in its own country only. The
group has been involved in two known
successful thefts.

The threat actors withdraw money
through card processing: they gain
access to bank card management
systems, change card limits, and
withdraw cash from ATMs using cards
they obtained in advance.

Penetration method
We do not have accurate information
about the attack methods and vectors
that the group uses to penetrate
networks. Neither phishing emails
nor malicious documents that could
have been used to deliver the payload
have been discovered. However,
some malicious file samples were
configured to work with C&C servers
on the local network. Based on this
data, we can assume that the hackers
already have a controlled device within
the organization that allows them
to attack the corporate network. This
could be either a corporate computer
or a device brought from outside.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

Tools
SilentCards uses self-developed tools,
Metasploit, and various PowerShell
scripts to automate certain tasks during
attacks. The group’s own tools include:
• keylogger, which sends the
results of its activity to an FTP
server or email address;
• battlefield: a shell written in Python
and packed in .exe using py2exe. Its
capabilities include a remote command
shell, creating and saving screenshots
to a local disk, and downloading
files from an arbitrary URL.

Geographical scope

Tools

Lazarus has always been mainly focused
on the Asia-Pacific region. Its attack
on Polish banks in 2017 seemed more like
an exception rather than the rule.

The threat actors continue to use their
loader (known as Ratankba) for the
first stage of attack. The loader’s first
PowerShell modification was released
in 2017, and in 2019 security experts
discovered its updated version. To attack
Apple users, Lazarus created a loader
that has been named AppleJeus.

However, in October 2018, HSBC
detected an attack on its Maltese office
carried out by an unidentified threat
actor that was named EmpireMonkey.
In February 2019, €13 million was stolen
from Bank of Valletta, a Maltese bank.
Group-IB attributes the attacks
on Maltese banks to Lazarus, which could
indicate the group’s renewed interest
in European companies.

Penetration method
Lazarus uses various vectors and
sophisticated tools to breach banks:
• Spear phishing, which
is used for targeting a very
small group of recipients.
• Watering hole: By gaining access
to the websites of financial regulators,
Lazarus attacks the website’s visitors.
The malicious code is loaded
only if the visitor comes from
a specific pool of IP addresses.

In late 2018, Client_RAT (aka FALLCHILL,
Manuscrypt), the group’s main Trojan,
was also rewritten in PowerShell. Its
functionality is identical to that of the
previous version, but it is much more
difficult to detect.
To proxy traffic, the group uses its own
proxy bot called ClientTraficForwarder,
but also employs the well-known
Metasploit and Cobalt Strike
frameworks during attacks, which makes
it more difficult to attribute the attack
to a specific group.
The threat actors carry out thefts through
ATM Switch using their own unique
malware called Fastcash.

• Social engineering: The threat actors
identify the most suitable employee
on social media and offer them
a job; the employee is prompted
to download and install a malicious
program at their workplace.

Theft method
The main method Lazarus uses in attacks
on financial organizations is SWIFT.
The group has also presumably been
using ATM Switch to withdraw money
since 2016, with two such thefts in India
in Chile reported in 2018.

CURRENT THREATS
Most thefts through SWIFT occurred
in the second half of 2017 and the
first half of 2018, which was followed
by a lull. Over the period investigated, the
attackers carried out only two successful
thefts from banks in India and Malta,
with the overall sum stolen amounting
to $16 million.
Only two groups, Lazarus and Cobalt,
have successfully stolen money through
SWIFT. As such, when the incident
in Malta could not be attributed to either,
some cybersecurity specialists suggested
that there was a “new” group called
EmpireMonkey. The second incident

attributed to this group was an attack
on HSBC’s Maltese office, which was
successfully halted. Group-IB believes
that the group behind these attacks
is Lazarus.

of Mexican banks, Banco de Chile, and
the Turkish bank Akbank, which all fell
victim to a successful theft a year later,
and also the HSBC subnets that were
allegedly attacked by “EmpireMonkey”.

In as early as 2017, Lazarus tried
to attack banks in Europe by using the
watering hole penetration method.
Apart from Poland, the threat actors
compromised the websites of financial
regulators in Mexico and Uruguay.
Security specialists managed to locate
a configuration file that specified the
subnets of banks in which Lazarus was
interested. The file listed the subnets

This shows that, despite fewer thefts
through SWIFT overall, this attack vector
remains relevant. Moreover, new tools
designed for these types of attack may
emerge.

FORECAST: THE APPEARANCE OF POWERSHELL-WRITTEN BANSWIFT/BBSWIFT
In 2016, during the well-known attack
on the central bank of Bangladesh,
Lazarus used a special program called
Banswift/BBSwift. It allowed the hackers
to track transactions, modify databases,
and block the printing of SWIFT
documents.

During all subsequent incidents,
the group abandoned these types
of automation tools and carried out
theft operations manually. The attackers
compromised the workstations
of operators who had legitimate access
to the SWIFT interface. To withdraw
money, the threat actors used the MT103
Serial or MT103 Cover messages.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

Over the past year, Lazarus has
significantly improved its tools, mainly
by redeveloping them using PowerShell.
The group might use an equivalent
of Banswift/BBSwift written
in PowerShell in future thefts.

38

THEFT THROUGH ATM SWITCH
In 2018, Lazarus attacked Cosmos Bank,
an Indian bank, which resulted in a twostep money withdrawal process:
• $11 million was withdrawn from banking
customer accounts with the help
of third-party individuals using forged
bank cards in ATMs. Nearly 15,000
such transactions were carried out
in 28 countries in just seven hours.
Another $400,000 was cashed out
in ATMs using fake cards in India only.
• $2 million was transferred through
SWIFT from the bank’s accounts
to fraudulent accounts in Hong
Kong the next day.

The attack described above was
far from the only one:
• Some of the malicious files related
to the Cosmos Bank incident
were compiled in 2016.
• After the incident, a customer
informed Group-IB that their bank
in Asia had been attacked in the
same way in as early as 2016.

The method used by the threat actors
at the first stage of attack was named
FastCash. The scheme seems simple but
is difficult to implement:
• Obtain access to a bank’s network.
• Find Switch application servers
for handling ATM transactions—
ATM Switch, which runs
on the AIX operating system
by IBM (similar to UNIX).

Usually, requests from ATMs are
received by an application server, which
runs checks in the bank’s systems
to determine whether to approve
a money withdrawal. The malicious
code intercepted these requests and
substituted responses to approve the
money withdrawal.

• Compromise these servers and
upload a command-line utility
to add the threat actor’s malicious
library to a running process.

• In 2017, US-CERT reported that
a similar method had been used
to steal money through ATMs
in 30 countries. The announcement
was likely related to a 2015
incident when Lazarus attacked
an ATM operator in South Korea
and had access to their network
and ATMs until February 2017.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

• In addition to Cosmos Bank, 2018 saw
a similar technique being successfully
used to steal money through Redbanc,
a Chilean interbank network.

39

LOGICAL ATTACKS ON ATMS
As mentioned earlier, three out of five
active groups possess ATM Trojans,
namely Cobalt, Silence, and MoneyTaker.
However, over the period investigated,
only Silence conducted successful
attacks on ATMs.
The group had previously used their
own Trojan called Atmosphere, but
in February 2019 they employed
a new Trojan in an attack in Russia. The
malware’s code indicated that it was
designed for theft in dollars.
Three months later, Silence successfully
robbed Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited
(DBBL), a Bangladeshi bank, presumably
using the new Trojan they had tested
in Russia. Soon thereafter, six Ukranians
who had withdrawn the money from
ATMs were arrested.

In addition to the confirmed attack
on DBBL, Silence attempted to steal
money from two other banks (NCC Bank
and Prime Bank). The banks said that
financial losses had been prevented,
however.
Silence’s new Trojan scans all running
processes for “msxfs.dll” and injects
code into the process where the .dll
file is detected. The injected code

enumerates all threads in the application
and freezes some of them, likely those
belonging to the “msxfs.dll” module.
Instead of using regular XFS API with
the constants WFS_CMD_CDM_
DENOMINATE and WFS_CMD_CDM_
DISPENSE, money is withdrawn using
WFS_CMD_CDM_START_EXCHANGE
and WFS_CMD_CDM_END_EXCHANGE
sequentially.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

In May 2018, MoneyTaker successfully
tested their unique Trojan for ATMs
in Russia, but no other incidents followed.
Unlike Silence, MoneyTaker’s ATM
Trojan can interact with the dispenser
specifically through XFS API.

40

THEFT THROUGH CARD PROCESSING
Stages of card
processing attacks:
• Gain control over
a bank’s network.
• Check whether it is possible
to connect to the card
processing system.
• Issue or buy cards for the
banks where access has
been established.
• Train money mules who will
travel to another country
with these cards.
• Remove or increase the
cash withdrawal limit.

At different stages of their evolution,
Cobalt, MoneyTaker, and Silence carried
out attacks on card processing systems.
Only Silence continued to use this
method over the period investigated,
but a new group with a similar-sounding
name appeared: SilentCards.
Silence conducted their first card
processing attack in March 2018 and
managed to steal $549,000 from
a Russian bank. Analysis of publicly
available information about incidents
in India related to Dutch-Bangla
Bank Limited, NCC Banks, and Prime
Bank revealed that the money was
withdrawn from ATMs in Russia, Ukraine,
and Cyprus. This scheme could only

be possible if the attackers had gained
access to the card processing systems
and had been in possession of several
cards issued by these banks. This scheme
is completely safe for the mules, who can
withdraw money in a different country
until the cards are blocked or until they
run out of ATMs with money.
In 2018, researchers detected an incident
that has been linked to the group
SilentCards. The hackers gained
access to a card processing system and
successfully transferred 400 million
Kenyan shillings by penetrating the
corporate network and infiltrating the key
servers responsible for money transfers.

• Remove overdraft limits
to withdraw cash when
the balance is below zero,
even for debit cards.
• Withdraw money
on command from various
ATMs thanks to the mules.

NON-TARGETED ATTACKS
and threats to banking customers

In recent years, threat actors have been gradually abandoning banking Trojans, attacks on banking customers have become
increasingly simpler from a technical point of view, and each direct theft has caused less damage.
However, because financial data is easy to compromise, such incidents have become significantly more frequent. In 2019, JS sniffers
made carding one of the fastest-growing threats to online banking customers.

COMMON CARDING TRENDS
In recent years, the market for collecting
bank card data has continued to grow.
It can be divided into two segments:
textual data (card number, expiration
date, cardholder name, address, CVV)
and dumps (magnetic stripe data).

that are connected to POS terminals.
To obtain textual data, hackers use
phishing websites; banking Trojans for
PC, Android, and ATMs; and JS sniffers
(malicious code incorporated into the
websites of online stores or other portals
where users enter their card payment
details). JS sniffers are the main discovery

Dumps are collected using skimming
devices and Trojans for computers

Year

2019

this year and security experts note a clear
trend of their increasing popularity.
Over the period investigated, the
number of compromised cards grew
from 27.1 million to 43.8 million. The
average price for textual data increased
from $9 to $14, while the average price
for a dump fell from $33 to $22.

EVOLUTION OF POS THREATS
Bank card dumps make up about 80%
of the carding market. Over the period
investigated, cybersecurity specialists
detected 31.2 million dumps put up for
sale, i.e. 46% more than last year.
The main method of compromising
magnetic stripe data is infecting
computers connected to POS terminals
with special Trojans that collect bank card
information from RAM.

In the past year, cybersecurity specialists
detected four new POS Trojans, which
had been actively used in attacks but
remained unnoticed. The source codes
of most programs known previously
(Alina, MajikPos, FrameworkPOS) have
long been shared on hacker forums and
could be used by anyone.

A total of 17 major data
leaks—14 identified and three yet
unlinked to any company—occurred
between March 2018 and June 2019.
The descriptions of the databases found
on card shops mention that much more

compromised data is available than
what has been put up for sale. When
evaluating this market, Group-IB experts
only took into account the data that has
been put up for sale; the actual volume
of dumps could be even bigger. There

are 3.6 million such cards in total, which
accounts for 11% of their overall number.
The rest of the data is posted in small
batches, which makes it more difficult
to link it to major leaks.

Difficulties in attributing
major leaks
When dumps are identified, almost
no technical details are available, which
makes the attribution process difficult
and only allows for assumptions about
who might be responsible for a particular
leak.
In the case of FIN7, the attackers were
identified either when an attacked
company named that group specifically
or when company names were published
in indictments as part of investigations.
When it comes to major leaks, we can
only guess the possible links between

response operations to particular
incidents and the publication of technical
descriptions of new Trojans without
company names being mentioned. For
instance:

• In June 2019, a month after the
response to the Cotton Patch
Cafe incident, news emerged
about the Badhatch Trojan,
which was linked to FIN8.

• In August 2018, it was reported
that Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen
experienced a data breach. Later that
month, information about a Trojan
called RtPOS was first published.

Geographical scope of dump
sources

• In March 2019, a response operation
to the incident at Earl Enterprise
(Buca di Beppo, Earl of Sandwich,
Planet Hollywood) started; in the
same month, information about
two new POS Trojans (GlitchPOS
and DMSniff) appeared.

The main targets for attackers are fast
food restaurants in the US. The country
comes first in terms of the number
of compromised cards—close to 93%
of all dumps. This year, the US is followed
by Middle Eastern countries (Kuwait,
Pakistan, the UAE, and Qatar), which
together account for 2.38%.

Possible reasons for the Middle
Eastern anomaly

After the news was shared, another two
databases with Pakistani bank data were
published:

skimming equipment, but the amount
of data collected that way is always small.
Another option is to compromise a bank
that does not comply with international
security requirements and stores PIN
code information.

Thanks to proprietary infrastructure
for monitoring underground forums
and card shops, Group-IB sees the
full picture of the carding market and
detects anomalies therein. In the period
investigated, there was an unusual rise
in the number of compromised Pakistani
bank cards, which almost no one sold
before October 2018.
On October 26, a database containing
10,467 dumps was put up for sale, with
8,704 of them belonging to Pakistani
banks, including BankIslami. Two days
later, BankIslami announced that
on October 27, attackers withdrew about
$2.6 million from the bank’s accounts.

• October 31, 2018 — 11,795 dumps;
• November 13, 2018 — 177,878 dumps.
A total of 150,632 dumps of Pakistani
cards were put up for sale. This was only
the first wave, however.
On January 24, a small-scale database
appeared with 1,535 dumps; 96%
of the cards in it had been issued
by the Pakistani bank Meezan Bank
Ltd. On January 30, a large database
of 67,654 dumps emerged.
What distinguished this database from
previous ones was that it contained
PIN codes. Obtaining dumps with
PIN codes usually requires hardware

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

On January 16, a file called
“ApplicationPDF.exe” was uploaded
to VirusTotal from Pakistan. The file
is a malicious program created by the
threat group Lazarus, which the threat
actors send to bank employees after
interacting with them on social media.
A similar program was used for gaining
access during the attack on Redbanc,
a Chilean interbank network. The file
uploaded to VirusTotal was compiled
on October 31, 2018 and cannot be linked
to the 2018 leaks, but it can explain the
incidents in 2019.

NEW TREND: JS SNIFFERS
JS sniffers are one of the most effective
methods of compromising bank cards.
A sniffer is a type of malicious code
that threat actors incorporate into their
victims’ websites to intercept data
entered by users, such as bank card
numbers, names, addresses, logins,
and passwords. Threat actors sell
the payment data they obtain or use
it themselves to buy valuable goods.
RiskIQ, together with Flashpoint, were
the first to analyze the activities of threat
actors that use sniffers. They singled

out 12 groups and gave them a common
name: MageCart. Group-IB analyzed
the discovered sniffers, and—by applying
proprietary analytical systems—exposed
the entire infrastructure and gained
access to the threat actors’ source
codes and tools. This approach helped
detect at least 38 different sniffer
families as at spring 2019. At the time
of publishing this report, that number has
grown.

Each sniffer family has unique
characteristics and is most likely
managed by different individuals. As all
sniffers have similar functionalities,
it is not practical for the same threat
group to create two different sniffers.

How sniffers work
Step 1: Gain access to a website
• Option 1 — Gain access
to the administrator panel by using
password-stealing malware.

• Option 1: Sell data to carders for
$1–$5 per card. This is the easiest
method as only the contact details
of verified buyers are needed.

• Option 2 — Search for vulnerable
websites (exploits of popular CMSs;
known vulnerabilities of service
providers). By using exploits, threat
actors load a web shell, gain access
to a website, and modify its files.

• Option 2: Use stolen cards
to purchase easily re-sellable
goods, such as gadgets, electronics,
home appliances, interior
items, clothes, and shoes.

• Option 3 — Purchase access
to a website from another threat group.

Collected payment and the
victim’s personal data are sent to the
threat actors’ server (a gate). To make
it more complicated to detect the
threat actors’ server, the JS sniffer
chain uses many levels of gates located
on different servers or hacked websites.
In some cases, however, the admin panel
is located on the same host as the gate
that is used for collecting stolen data.

Step 2: Acquire a JS sniffer
• Option 1 — Develop a JS sniffer.
• Option 2 — Buy or rent a ready-made
solution on an underground forum.
Step 3: Install a sniffer
Installed via a control panel or web shell,
a JS sniffer collects data and sends
it to a host managed by the threat actor.
Some sniffers use techniques that allow
them to remain unnoticed during manual
checks:
• Add it to a legitimate script library.
• Suspend JS sniffer activity
when the developer console
is being used (e.g. Chrome DevTools
or Firefox Browser Toolbox).

User

Step 4: Monetization

The threat actor's end server for
tracking JS sniffer activity and exporting
stolen data can be either a full-feature
administrator panel or a server for
hosting database administration tools.
For example, administrator panel
features can be performed by tools such
as Adminer or phpMyAdmin.

16,9%

Threat actors use various methods
to infect websites and inject malicious
code.

Exploitation of CMS vulnerabilities
Malicious code can be injected into
the code of online store websites
by exploiting vulnerabilities in CMSs
developed specifically for online stores—
Magento, OpenCart, and others.

• Loading a web shell on a website
by exploiting a vulnerability,
with subsequent changes
to the website files.
• Injecting the JS sniffer code
by exploiting a vulnerability that allows
malicious code to be added to one
of the site code blocks (e.g. a footer).

Hacking of a website’s
administrator panel
JS sniffers can be installed by obtaining
access to a website’s administrator panel
with permission to edit files. The login and
password can be compromised through
several methods:
• stealers, i.e. programs that extract
passwords saved in browsers;
• malware for intercepting entered data
(including logins and passwords);
• brute force.

Hacking of third-party services
A sniffer can infiltrate a website through
hacked third-party services, whose
scripts work on the target website:
• Hacking websites that provide
services for online stores (customer
support chats or analytics and
statistics systems). By injecting
malicious code into the service
script code, a JS sniffer infiltrates
the code of online store websites.
• Hacking the accounts of CDN services,
with the ability to modify scripts
loaded from CDN to target websites.

Supply chain attacks

the threat actors injected the JS sniffer
code into the web analytics script. The
script, which is loaded by many sites,
would load a bank card JS sniffer along
with itself.
This type of malware delivery can result
in rival sniffer families being hacked. For
instance, during one wave of infections,
the operators of the WebRank sniffer
gained access to the MagentoName
JS sniffer code and added their malicious
code to it.
Another example is the attack on Feedify,
a real-time push notification service.
By injecting the JS sniffer code into
the code of a given file, the threat
actor automatically uploaded the
JS sniffer to all Feedify customers,
and their sites were infected with the
feedbackembad-min-1.0.js script. The
sniffer was injected into the Feedify
code on August 17, and was detected
and removed on September 11. However,
the intruders infected the website again
on September 12.
Supply chain attacks have proven
successful: more than 60% of the 300
sites that download the Feedify script are
e-commerce and therefore targets for
the WebRank JS sniffer family.

The threat group that used the WebRank
JS sniffer family often carried out attacks
on third-party sites that provided various
services for other websites. For example,
by hacking into a web analytics system,

Target payment systems
In terms of architecture, each JS sniffer
has a client and a server part.

The client part of the JS sniffer
is responsible for initial data
collection, which can be carried
out in various ways:
• On a hardcoded list of names
of payment form fields for
various payment systems;
• Using a list of regular
expressions that define fields
of interest to the JS sniffer and
contain sensitive information;
• According to the list
of basic HTML elements
used in the payment form.

The server part is the application
that the JS sniffer operator works
with.
The functions performed by the
server depend on how accurately
the client part determines the
type of data stolen. If the data
is transmitted in an unprocessed
form, the card number, CVV,
expiration date, etc. are identified
in the administrative panel.

Processing data in the administrative
panel is the most convenient option
as it is easier for hackers to make
changes to the administrative panel code
if necessary rather than to change the
code of the JS sniffer injected into the
online store website.
Many JS sniffer families are not universal,
however, and use unique options for
each payment system, which requires
modifying and testing the script before
each infection.

Universal JS sniffers
• Universal JS sniffer families steal
information from payment forms and
do not require modifications tailored
to specific websites. G-Analytics and
WebRank JS sniffer families collect all
the content from the hardcoded list
of HTML elements, which means that

all the collected information is parsed
in the administrative panels of these
JS sniffers, on the server side.
• WebRank JS sniffers search for
elements such as “text”, “a”, “button”,
“input”, “submit”, and “form” and create
specific event handlers for them all.
• G-Analytics JS sniffers search for
elements such as "input", "select",
"textarea", and "checkbox". If the
search results contain data matching
the credit card number’s regular
expression, the JS sniffer sends this
information to the attackers’ server.

JS sniffers for specific CMSs
Most JS sniffer families detected were
developed to steal information from the
payment forms within a specific CMS.
These JS sniffers search for specific fields
by the list of names hardcoded in the
JS sniffer source code. The fields could
contain the victim’s payment information.
The following JS sniffer families search
default Magento fields:
• PreMage;
• MagentoName;
• FakeCDN;
• Qoogle.
The GetBilling JS sniffer family
also targets Magento websites, but
it searches by name for forms, not fields.
The PostEval JS sniffer family targets
OpenCart websites. These JS sniffers
use a hardcoded list of names that
correspond to the fields in a payment
form. The list of field names is used
to search for the victim’s payment
information.

Analysis of some JS sniffer families
showed that, in some cases, the domains
used to store the JS sniffer code and
collect stolen data had been registered
by different users. In other cases, the
code had been modified and various
obfuscation methods and malicious
activity concealment techniques
had been used. This could indicate
that a separate family of JS sniffers
is used by different threat actors, i.e.
it is delivered as a service.
In other cases, a given threat
actor’s activities were clearly observed,
which could mean that it acts
independently of outside developers
and uses exclusively its own products.
This implies that such threat actors
have at least one member with web
development skills and knowledge
of languages such as HTML, JavaScript,
and PHP.

The cost of JS sniffers
 he cost of JS sniffers ranges
T
from $250 to $5,000. Some
services offer the option
to work in partnership: the client
provides access to the store and
receives 80% of the revenue,
while the JS sniffer developer
is responsible for providing hosting
servers, technical support, and
an administrative panel for the
client.

JS sniffer as a service
Each individual JS sniffer family can
represent a different service. When
analyzing underground forums
intended for communication between
cybercriminals, experts discovered
a large number of services offering
a comprehensive solution, including:
• JS sniffer or utility for
generating JS sniffers;
• administrative panel for data
processing and tracking
JS sniffer activity;
• manuals for infecting online store sites;
• ready-made exploits to infect sites;
• auxiliary utilities for vulnerability
searches and mass website infections.

Infection scale and victims

The average number of visitors
to infected websites for each JS sniffer
family shows which JS sniffers are
used to infect the most popular online
stores. The average number of visitors
to websites infected with Illum,
G-Analytics, and TokenMSN is about
3,000 people per day per site, while for
MagentoName it is about 500 people.

The JS sniffer families detected were
used to infect at least 2,440 online stores
that accept payment by bank card. The
total daily number of visitors to all the
infected websites is more than 1.5 million
people.

JS sniffers that are used to conduct
the most large-scale attacks
Due to mass website infections
(with the most visitors
to sites infected by the families
MagentoName and CoffeMokko),
every day more than 440,000
people visit the websites infected
with these JS sniffers. The
JS sniffer family that comes third
in terms of the number of websites
infected is WebRank, accounting
for 250,000 visitors.

MagentoName 446 272
CoﬀeMokko 440 776
WebRank 259 953

PostEval 10 449
Qoogle 4 059
PreMage 3 966

Analysis of the sites showed that
more than half were infected with
MagentoName, whose operators use
vulnerabilities to inject malicious code
into the code of sites running on older
versions of the CMS Magento. More than
13% of infections involve WebRank, which
is used in attacks on third-party services
to inject malicious code into target sites.
Moreover, 11% are infected by JS sniffers
belonging to the CoffeMokko family,
whose operators use obfuscated scripts
that search payment forms for specific
fields by the list of names hardcoded
in the JS sniffer source code. Such fields
could contain the victim’s payment
information.

Based on an analysis of the list of TLDs
(top-level domains) of infected online
stores, it can be concluded that attackers
are generally interested in infecting
websites from major developed
countries: the USA, the UK, Germany, etc.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

Similarly to attacks on POS terminals,
attackers mainly target banking
customers in the USA. UK banks rank
second, mainly due to a successful attack
on British Airways in late 2018 during
which its resources were infected with
a JS sniffer. As a result, a $229 million fine
was imposed on British Airways for data
leaks relating to more than 300,000
cards.

Analysis showed that there are
11 JS sniffer families that are behind the
attacks on Asian website users:
• MagentoName;
• Inter;
• addtoev Group;
• Qoogle;
• Illum;
• CoffeMokko;
• EUTag;
• WebRank;
• ImageID;
• TokenLogin;
• OnlineStatus.

The attackers mainly focused on websites
of companies based in Singapore, China,
and Malaysia.

WEB PHISHING AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING
Web phishing, one of the oldest and
simplest types of fraud, is often used
by attackers of all kinds. It is gradually
replacing complex attacks involving
expensive Trojans or hacking tools.
One of the reasons that web phishing
attacks are so popular is because they
are easy to conduct despite the fact that
they are continuously changing. Having
analyzed over three million links and
27,000 unique phishing kits over the past
year, Group-IB experts identified the
main trends in this threat’s evolution.

Anti-evasion techniques
Given that more and more companies
provide services for blocking phishing
websites, phishing kit developers tend
to sell them with built-in anti-evasion
mechanisms:
• Blocking by subnet: If a page request
is sent from a subnets belonging
to a company that provides phishing
detection services, phishing
content will not be shown.
• Blocking by user agent: Attackers
analyze the user agent and try
to understand if the user is real.
For example, if the attack targets
mobile device users, then visitors
using PC browsers will not receive
phishing pages. Usually, phishing
scripts check the user agent field
by a list of predefined keywords.

• Blocking by region: Attackers actively
use GeoIP databases; if users are not
located in the targeted region, they will
not be forwarded to the phishing page.
• Redirection to official websites:
Special checks help attackers
identify suspicious users and
redirect them to the attacked
brand’s official website or the website
of another legitimate service instead
of displaying phishing content.

DNS hijacking
Last year’s Group-IB Hi-Tech Crime
Trends report predicted that DNS
hijacking would actively evolve to help
conduct phishing attacks even more
effectively. Below is a reminder of how
this method works.
1. Access the router in one of the
following ways:

2. C
 hange the device DNS settings
by writing the addresses of the hackercontrolled DNS servers into the router
configuration. This means that instead
of returning the IP address of the
website that the user wants to visit (for
example, an online banking page), the
malicious DNS server returns a forged
IP address. In other words, malefactors
trick the browser into loading
a phishing webpage instead of the
website the user was looking for.
In September 2018, Qihoo 360
discovered a mass campaign. In one
week, the security company identified
more than 100,000 compromised
routers, most of which were located
in Brazil. The threat, called GhostDNS,
was active at least until May 2019. The
campaign mainly targeted customers
of several banks in Brazil and the Netflix
service.

• B
 rute-force attacks: Companies
that provide routers for rent do not
care much about their security
level, set default passwords, and
enable access to their management
interfaces via the Internet.
• E
 xploitation of known
vulnerabilities: Updating home
routers is not easy. The support
cycle for such devices is very short,
and updates are often unavailable.
Even in cases where updates
exist, users rarely install them.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

50

Phishing management systems
Once the victim's data is collected,
phishers usually perform one of the
following actions:
• Send data via email (still the
most popular method).
• Save data to a local text file, which
the criminal can retrieve from
a remote server in various ways.
• Upload logs to a remote
FTP server (rare).

Phishing admin panel for a fake Amazon website

Given that security systems have
evolved, however, criminals must handle
data in real time. Moreover, in an effort
to attract customers, criminals providing
phishing as a service started offering
user-friendly management systems.

Phishers targeting banking customers
have started using panels for managing
web injects more actively. The panels
help conduct attacks in real time, receive
one-time passwords from victims, and
perform additional actions to confirm
financial transactions. One of the most
popular panels is U-Admin.

Automated phishing framework

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

51

Automated phishing framework
An interesting example of phishing
automation was a phishing campaign
that targeted more than 200 banks,
universities, and companies to collect
email addresses and passwords. Its
particularity was that the framework used
was automatically tailored to each victim.
1. Links to the phishing page
were sent via email.
2. If the victim clicked on the link,
information about the email address
from which the link was followed
was marked as a parameter.
3. The phishing page scripts checked
the domain in the email address
and made an API request to the
server to obtain data to be displayed
on the phishing page.

5. I f the user was of interest, the
victim was redirected to further
pages after entering the login and
password on the phishing page.

4. By domain, the server determined
whether the user was of interest
and which logo should be used
on the phishing page.

Growth of social engineering
attacks without the use of malware

A typical fraud scenario involves the
following:

Social engineering without using malware
or phishing websites remains one of the
most widespread and popular schemes.
Criminals have always used phone
calls, text messages, and social media
to communicate with victims. As a result,
the victim provides the scammer with
all the necessary information or installs
remote access programs on their PC that
help the attacker perform fraudulent
activity. A new, unprecedented scheme
that appeared this year tricks victims into
installing remote control tools on their
mobile device instead of their PC.

• The hacker calls posing as a bank
employee and informs the customer
that an attempt has been made
to break into their online banking
account or withdraw funds.
• The customer is told that the
bank’s security team needs
help with solving a technical
issue to counter the fraud.
• The victim is asked to urgently
install a remote control tool on their
smartphone to protect the user.

During calls, criminals use various tricks,
some of which are highly convincing,
to win the victim's trust:
• They make calls from official
bank numbers using IP telephony
by replacing the phone number
through special programs.
• They provide the transaction
history and other information about
the customer, for example where
the victim lives (databases with
such information are available for
purchase on darknet forums).

• Having obtained control of the
device, the criminal withdraws funds
through the mobile banking app.

ATM TROJANS
The main and most dangerous threat
to ATMs is logical attacks. As the final
stage of targeted campaigns, logical
attacks result in gaining remote control
over ATMs. However, such schemes are
only available to advanced attackers.
Low-skilled actors must still gain physical
access to ATMs to steal money. Their
main limitation is the ability to attack
only one ATM at a time, so the potential
damage from such threats is much lower.
Malware is downloaded to specific
ATMs using CD-ROMs, USB flash
drives, or Raspberry Pi devices. Such
“jackpotting” attacks require the
involvement of three types of criminals:
organizer/customer, software developer,
and money mules.

New threats

HelloWorld

Unnamed Trojan from Africa

In January 2019, a user with the
nickname “gookee” made a post on the
underground forum exploit.in about
the sale of new malware. The name
“HelloWorld” was mentioned in the topic
about the sale of its previous, unfinished
version. The following versions of the
program were for sale:

In April 2019, Group-IB experts
discovered an interesting sample
of an ATM Trojan from Africa. The
program is designed to control ATMs
through the pinpad: when the correct
PIN code is entered, it interacts with the
dispenser directly, and when a bank card
with a certain number is used, the threat
actor can deplete the entire ATM.
To bypass whitelists, attackers used the
cmd.dll file, which is similar to the cmd.
exe command-line interpreter used
in the ReactOS operating system.

• an executable file similar to “Cutlet
Maker”, with a keygen or without;
• an IMG image for saving
it onto a flash drive;
• a CD image;
• a floppy disk image;
• an ISO image for booting via
PXE (under development).

Compared to logical attacks, the
landscape of such threats is much
smaller. It continues to evolve actively.

The Trojan runs on all Wincor/Diebold
Nixdorf models released after 2001,
which have MXFS/CSCW DLL files. The
cost of the program is $2,000 for an .EXE
file or image, $3,000 for all options, and
$10,000 for source codes.

This Trojan was uploaded to VirusTotal
first from Colombia, then from Mexico.

unusual: an HTTP server is launched
on the ATM, which interprets certain
paths as commands.

Evolution of АТМ Trojans
Cutlet Maker
Cutlet is one of the most widespread
ATM Trojans available for free. The tool
has been active since mid-2017. To date,
multiple malware variants have been
spotted on hacking forums.
In December 2018, yet another version
was posted on a Russian-speaking forum.
Cutlet has been used to successfully
attack Europe as well as Russia, and other
post-Soviet countries.
WinPot (Cutlet V2)
In May 2018, a user with the nickname
“sl111” made a post on an underground
forum about the sale of an ATM Trojan
for Wincor called “Cutlet Maker v2” (aka
WinPot). The Trojan is sold as a bundle
together with its source code. The cost
of the program varies from 500 to 1,000
US dollars. Like its predecessor, the
Trojan has been used to attack ATMs
in Europe.

Ploutus

Alice

This malware was originally for sale
in 2016. It had been used in Mexico for
a long time; in 2018, it appeared in the
USA. Despite its age, Ploutus is still
active; since 2019, ads about its sale have
been posted on hacker forums regularly.

This Trojan has been known since
November 2016. The tool reappeared
on underground forums in December
2018, as had ATMii. Compared to the
free tool Cutlet Maker, Alice is less
user-friendly and has not been observed
in attacks over the reporting period.

ATMii
ATMii was first discovered in April 2017.
Its distinctive feature was targeting
only ATMs running on Windows 7 and
Windows Vista. The malware's approach
was very peculiar because most
ATMs used Windows XP at the time.
In December 2018, ATMii was also
published on a Russian-speaking hacker
forum.

Italy

The trend towards a decrease in the
activity of banking Trojans for PCs has
only intensified. Criminals have stopped
developing new theft techniques
involving PC Trojans. The only
country where these Trojans continue
to be developed is Brazil.

USA and Canada
In the USA, the threat landscape related
to PC banking Trojans has not changed
much: attacks have been mainly
conducted using IcedID, Trickbot, and
Dridex and, to a lesser extent, Qbot,
Ramnit, Panda Banker, and Danabot.
The situation in Canada has always
been similar to that in the USA, and
only the owners of one of the Gozi forks
have a particular interest in banking
customers in Canada. IcedID continues
to use web injections. Unlike many
other banking Trojans, it employs the
Automatic Transfer System (ATS) to steal
money from victims' bank accounts
automatically.
It is worth paying particular attention
to the Trickbot Trojan. Over the past
year, it has been fitted with a new
module for collecting passwords from
installed apps and has been programmed
to steal configuration files from SYSVOL
directories on domain controllers. It has
also started employing Mimikatz and
has featured in fileless attacks and active
mail-outs from compromised computers.
These functionalities can be used for
targeted attacks on large organizations.
We believe that, in the near future, a new
group may emerge that will use Trickbot
for targeted attacks on banks rather than
their customers.

Europe
European banking customers are still
being targeted by BackSwap, Gootkit,
Danabot, Osiris, and TinyNuke tools.
The simple banking Trojan Retefe poses
a serious threat to northern European
countries.
All these Trojans are well known except
BackSwap, which is relatively new. Over
the past year, the Trojan began attacking
banking customers—first Polish, then
Spanish. In general, Poland is the only
European country in which attackers
have been noticeably more interested.

Russia and other post-Soviet
countries
In Russia, the "homeland" of most
banking Trojans, only one banking Trojan
continues to be actively used: RTM. Its
victims are mainly customers of poorly
protected banks, however. The banking
botnet Toplel has stopped being used
and no new thefts were detected this
year.

The owners of the botnet Buhtrap2
previously performed automated
transfers through the Russian
1C accounting system. This scheme led
to compromise being detected, however,
which prevented criminals from carrying
out the thefts. In February 2019, the
hackers tried to revive their botnet, but
the financial outcome was unsatisfactory
and they stopped their activity.

APAC
The most attractive country for attackers
in this region is Australia, where Gozi,
Trickbot, Gootkit, Ramnit, and Danabot
are all used to attack victims. The
second most popular country is Japan,
where the list of active Trojans includes
Gozi, Ramnit, Panda banker, and
Osiris. Despite the high population and
developed banking services, attackers
have no interest in other countries in the
region.

Another banking Trojan was discovered
in March 2019, tracked as BANKER.
THBAIAI. Below is a description
of the entire toolset that scammers use
to conduct attacks involving it.
1. The first module infects the
computer, then loads and executes
PowerShell scripts that write .LNK
files to the Startup folder and force
the computer to reboot. After the
reboot, a fake login screen is displayed
to intercept user credentials.
2. T
 he second Trojan is launched;
it attempts to open Microsoft
Outlook and obtain all the
email addresses stored therein.
If Outlook is not installed on the
computer, this step is skipped.
3. RADMIN is installed on the system.
4. The last step is the installation
of a fileless banking Trojan that targets
customers of the Brazilian banks Banco
Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, and Sicredi.

Latin America
As mentioned earlier, Brazil is becoming
the main source of new banking Trojans.
However, they are used locally only
and are most likely developed by local
hackers. A distinctive feature of these
Trojans is overlapping windows that
emulate the operation of banking
applications.
MnuBot, discovered in the first half
of 2018, is notable for the fact that its
component is a remote access Trojan that
receives commands from the Microsoft
SQL database server. A configuration
file with a list of targeted banks is also
received from the C&C server.
CamuBot was first used for attack
purposes in August 2018. Attackers took
an atypical approach to its distribution.
Instead of mass campaigns, they called
victims purporting to be bank employees
and tricked them into visiting a phishing
website to download a “security” module.
Once downloaded to the victim's device,
CamuBot creates a tunnel that allows
attackers to direct their own traffic
through the infected machine and use
the victim’s IP address when accessing
the compromised bank account.
When the installation is complete,
a pop-up screen redirects the victim
to a phishing website disguised as their
bank’s online banking portal. The victim
is asked to log into their account and
unknowingly sends the credentials to the
attacker.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

ANDROID TROJANS
Usually, Android banking Trojans steal
money using one of the following
techniques:
• money transfers through
hijacked SMS messaging;
• rogue mobile banking apps;
• collection of bank card data, logins and
passwords by displaying fake windows.
The first two methods have serious
limitations as regards the extent of the
theft. Few banks provide SMS money
transfer services and the transfer limits
are very low. The proliferation of fake
banking mobile applications requires
considerable investment and effort
to advertise and promote them. As such,
the use of fake windows has been
the most effective method. Phishing
windows are displayed on top of other
apps and require the user to enter the
relevant data.

When security policies were tightened
in updated versions of Android and
fraudulent applications could no longer
display arbitrary windows, the attack
scheme stopped being effective. Most
Android Trojan developers were unable
to adjust their malware to updates, which
meant that many effective Android
Trojans stopped working. Some projects
were closed, others were abandoned
by developers. The development of these
Trojans slowed noticeably, leading to less
damage from their actions.
In the past, to confirm banking
operations, banks used text messages.
With the widespread introduction
of mobile applications, banks began
to switch from text messages to PUSH
notifications. Transaction confirmation
codes are also delivered through
PUSH notifications. Compared to text
messages, PUSH notifications have

several key advantages: they are cheaper
for banks and safer against Android
Trojans because all Android-based
banking Trojans are able to intercept text
messages. This was another reason why
the activity of Android banking Trojans
decreased.
Nevertheless, security measures
used by banks can be bypassed
using the Accessibility Service, which
is intended for people with disabilities.
Having received permission to use the
Accessibility Service, the malicious
application can block other applications'
windows, control the device using voice
commands, listen to (rather than view)
content, manage PUSH notifications,
covertly unlock the device, and perform
arbitrary actions, all the while keeping the
screen turned off.

Gustuff: ATS feature for Android
The Gustuff Trojan is an improved
version of the malware AndyBot ,
developed by the same author. The
application’s features include: sending
information about the infected device
to the server, reading/sending text
messages, sending USSD requests,
setting up the SOCKS5 proxy, following
links, displaying push notifications,
transferring files (including photos)
to the server, displaying fake web pages,
and resetting the device to factory
settings. The application also uses the
Accessibility Service to interact with
elements of windows in other apps

New adjusted Trojans without ATS
Cerberus was put up for sale in June
2019. Its features are similar to Gustuff’s.
It can also be used to manipulate PUSH
notifications from banks. The Cerberus
Trojan uses enhanced self-defense
techniques:

and perform actions that are crucial for
hackers, such as focusing on the object,
clicking on the object, and changing
object text content. For example, at the
server’s instruction, the Trojan is able
to change text field values in banking
apps.
Gustuff has a unique feature that has
not been seen previously in malicious
programs for Android: an ATS
mechanism, which works according
to the following algorithm:
• The Trojan sends a PUSH
notification to the user with the
banking app’s official icon.

• Disable Google Play Protect
and turn it off after a time period
specified in the admin panel;
• Prevent the bot from being deleted,
administrator rights from being
disabled, and the Accessibility
Service from being turned off.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2019/2020

• The user clicks on the
PUSH notification.
• The associated legitimate app opens.
• The user logs in to the application.
• On the server’s command, Gustuff
automatically fills payment
fields for illicit transactions.
The price for leasing the “Gustuff Bot”
is $800 per month. The author claims
to take care of their own safety, which
is why the bot does not operate in Russia,
post-Soviet countries, or the USA.

• Evasion of sandbox analysis
using accelerometer data.
The author prohibits the use of the Trojan
in Russia and other post-Soviet countries.
The price for leasing the Trojan is $2,000
per month.

CometBot emerged on hacking forums
in February 2019, when a user with the
nickname “SickHavana” made a post
about renting out new malware for
Android.
This Trojan’s features are much inferior
to those of the programs described
above. However, it works on the latest
Android versions. The offer only included
ready-made web fakes for German banks
and one Spanish bank, with the possibility
of a simple expansion to target banks
in other regions.
The price for leasing the Trojan
is $850 per month.

In March 2019, Exobot Compact, the
third version of the infamous malware
for Android called Exobot, was put up for
sale. In May 2018, the source code for
Exobot version 2 was made public. The
new version was completely rewritten
and optimized compared to the one that
was publicly available. Exobot Compact
runs on modern versions of Android
up to Android 9.

BasBanke is a new Android Trojan that
targets banking customers in Brazil.
BasBanke’s functionality is quite basic,
but its owners were able to place
it on Google Play. As a result, it was
downloaded more than 10,000 times.
This malware can perform tasks such
as keystroke logging, screen recording,
and text message interception.

As was the case with Gustuff, the author
prohibits attacks in Russia and other
post-Soviet countries and the USA,
although the program has fake pages for
U.S. banks.
The price for leasing the program
is $1,500 per month.
