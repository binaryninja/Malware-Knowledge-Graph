April 18, 2023

Over the past several months, Microsoft has observed a mature subgroup of Mint Sandstorm, an Iranian nation-state
actor previously tracked as PHOSPHORUS, refining its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Specifically, this
subset has rapidly weaponized N-day vulnerabilities in common enterprise applications and conducted highly-targeted
phishing campaigns to quickly and successfully access environments of interest. This Mint Sandstorm subgroup has also
continued to develop and use custom tooling in selected targets, notably organizations in the energy and transportation
sectors. Given this subgroup’s capabilities, the profile of past targets, and the potential for cascading effects, Microsoft is
publishing details on known tradecraft alongside corresponding detections and mitigations to help organizations protect
against this and similar threats.

Who is Mint Sandstorm?
Mint Sandstorm is Microsoft’s new name for PHOSPHORUS, an Iranian nation-state actor. This new name is part of the
new threat actor naming taxonomy we announced today, designed to keep pace with the evolving and growing threat
landscape.
Mint Sandstorm is known to pursue targets in both the private and public sectors, including political dissidents, activist
leaders, the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), journalists, and employees from multiple government agencies, including
individuals protesting oppressive regimes in the Middle East. Activity Microsoft tracks as part of the larger Mint
Sandstorm group overlaps with public reporting on groups known as APT35, APT42, Charming Kitten, and TA453.
Mint Sandstorm is a composite name used to describe several subgroups of activity with ties to the same organizational
structure. Microsoft assesses that Mint Sandstorm is associated with an intelligence arm of Iran’s military, the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an assessment that has been corroborated by multiple credible sources including
Mandiant, Proofpoint, and SecureWorks. In 2022, the US Department of Treasury sanctioned elements of Mint
Sandstorm for past cyberattacks citing sponsorship from the IRGC.
Today, Microsoft is reporting on a distinct Mint Sandstorm subgroup that specializes in hacking into and stealing sensitive
information from high-value targets. This Mint Sandstorm subgroup is technically and operationally mature, capable of
developing bespoke tooling and quickly weaponizing N-day vulnerabilities, and has demonstrated agility in its operational
focus, which appears to align with Iran’s national priorities.
Microsoft Threat Intelligence consistently tracks threat actor activity, including Mint Sandstorm and its subgroups, and
works across Microsoft Security products and services to build detections into our products that improve protection for
customers. As with any observed nation state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted
or compromised, providing them with the information they need to secure their accounts. Microsoft is sharing details on
these operations to raise awareness on the risks associated with their activity and to empower organizations to harden
their attack surfaces against tradecraft commonly used by this Mint Sandstorm subgroup.

Recent operations
From late 2021 to mid-2022, this Mint Sandstorm subgroup moved from reconnaissance to direct targeting of US critical
infrastructure including seaports, energy companies, transit systems, and a major US utility and gas entity potentially in
support of retaliatory destructive cyberattacks. This targeting was likely in response to Iran’s attribution of cyberattacks
that halted maritime traffic at a major Iranian seaport in May 2020, delayed Iranian trains in July 2021, and crashed gas
station payment systems throughout Iran in late 2021. Of note, a senior cybersecurity-focused IRGC official and others
close to the Iranian Supreme Leader pinned the attack affecting gas station payment systems on Israel and the United
States.

1/9

This targeting also coincided with a broader increase in the pace and the scope of cyberattacks attributed to Iranian threat
actors, including another Mint Sandstorm subgroup, that Microsoft observed beginning in September 2021. The increased
aggression of Iranian threat actors appeared to correlate with other moves by the Iranian regime under a new national
security apparatus, suggesting such groups are less bounded in their operations. Given the hardline consensus among
policymakers in Tehran and sanctions previously levied on Iran’s security organizations, Mint Sandstorm subgroups may
be less constrained in carrying out malicious cyber activity.

Mint Sandstorm tradecraft
Microsoft has observed multiple attack chains and various tools in compromises involving this Mint Sandstorm subgroup.
The TTPs detailed below are a sampling of new or otherwise notable tradecraft used by this actor.

Rapid adoption of publicly disclosed POCs for initial access and persistence
Microsoft has increasingly observed this Mint Sandstorm subgroup adopting publicly disclosed proof-of-concept (POC)
code shortly after it is released to exploit vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. Until 2023, this subgroup had been
slow to adopt exploits for recently-disclosed vulnerabilities with publicly reported POCs, often taking several weeks to
successfully weaponize exploits for vulnerabilities like Proxyshell and Log4Shell. However, beginning in early 2023,
Microsoft observed a notable decrease in the time required for this subgroup to adopt and incorporate public POCs. For
example, Mint Sandstorm began exploiting CVE-2022-47966 in Zoho ManageEngine on January 19, 2023, the same day
the POC became public. They later exploited CVE-2022-47986 in Aspera Faspex within five days of the POC being made
public on February 2, 2023.
While this subgroup has demonstrated their ability to rapidly incorporate new public POCs into their playbooks, Microsoft
has also observed that Mint Sandstorm continues to use older vulnerabilities, especially Log4Shell, to compromise
unpatched devices. As this activity is typically opportunistic and indiscriminate, Microsoft recommends that
organizations regularly patch vulnerabilities with publicly available POCs, regardless of how long the POC has
been available.
After gaining initial access to an organization by exploiting a vulnerability with a public POC, this Mint Sandstorm
subgroup deploys a custom PowerShell script designed for discovery. In some cases, the subgroup does not act on the
information they collect, possibly because they assess that a victim does not meet any targeting requirements or because
the subgroup wishes to wait and focus on more valuable targets. In cases where Mint Sandstorm operators continue their
pursuit of a given target, Microsoft typically observes one of two possible attack chains.

2/9

Figure 1. The two attack chains used by the Mint Sandstorm subgroup
Attack chain 1: The Mint Sandstorm subgroup proceeds using Impacket to move laterally through a compromised
organization and relies extensively on PowerShell scripts (rather than custom implants) to enumerate admin
accounts and enable RDP connections. In this attack chain, the subgroup uses an SSH tunnel for command and
control (C2), and the final objective in many cases is theft of the Active Directory database. If obtained, the Mint
Sandstorm subgroup can use the Active Directory database to access credentials for users’ accounts. In cases
where users’ credentials are accessed and the target organization has not reset corresponding passwords, the
actors can log in with stolen credentials and masquerade as legitimate users, possibly without attracting attention
from defenders. The actors could also gain access to other systems where individuals may have reused their
passwords.
Attack chain 2: As is the case in attack chain 1, the Mint Sandstorm subgroup uses Impacket to move laterally.
However, in this progression, the operators use webhook.site for C2 and create scheduled tasks for persistence.
Finally, in this attack chain, the actors deploy a custom malware variant, such as Drokbk or Soldier. These custom
malware variants signal an increase in the subgroup’s level of sophistication, as they shift from using publicly
available tools and simple scripts to deploying fully custom developed malicious code.

Use of custom tools to evade detection
Since 2022,Microsoft has observed this Mint Sandstorm subgroup using two custom implants, detected by Microsoft
security products as Drokbk and Soldier, to persist in target environments and deploy additional tools. Drobkbk and
Soldier both use Mint Sandstorm-controlled GitHub repositories to host a domain rotator containing the operators’ C2
domains. This allows Mint Sandstorm to dynamically update their C2 infrastructure, which may help the operators stay a
step ahead of defenders using list-based domain blocking.
Drokbk: Drokbk.exe is a custom .NET implant with two components: an installer, sometimes accessed from a
compressed archive on a legitimate file-sharing platform, and a secondary backdoor payload. The Drokbk backdoor
issues a web request to obtain the contents of a README file on a Mint Sandstorm-controlled GitHub repo. The
README file contains a list of URLs that direct targets to the C2 infrastructure associated with Drokbk.
Soldier: Soldier is a multistage .NET backdoor with the ability to download and run additional tools and uninstall
itself. Like Drokbk, Soldier C2 infrastructure is stored on a domain rotator on a GitHub repository operated by Mint
Sandstorm. Microsoft Threat Intelligence analysts assess that Soldier is a more sophisticated variant of Drokbk.

3/9

In certain cases, this Mint Sandstorm subgroup has used TTPs outside of these attack chains, notably when they have
failed to achieve short-term objectives. In one instance, Microsoft also observed the subgroup using TTPs from both
attack chains in a single compromised environment. However, in most cases, Mint Sandstorm activity displays one of the
above discussed attack chains.

Low-volume phishing campaigns using template injection
Microsoft has also observed this Mint Sandstorm subgroup using a distinct attack chain involving low-volume phishing
campaigns and a third custom implant.In these operations, the group crafts bespoke phishing emails, often purporting to
contain information on security policies that affect countries in the Middle East, to deliver weaponized documents to
individuals of interest. Recipients are typically individuals affiliated with high-profile think tanks or universities in Israel,
North America, or Europe with ties to the security and policy communities. Unlike their initial exploitation of vulnerable
internet-facing applications, which is largely indiscriminate and affects organizations across sectors and geographies,
activity associated with this campaign was highly targeted and affected fewer than 10 organizations..
The initial emails are most commonly lures designed to social engineer recipients into clicking a OneDrive link hosting a
PDF spoofed to resemble information on a topic involving security or policy in the Middle East. The PDF contains a link to
a macro-enabled template file (dotm) hosted on Dropbox. This file has been weaponized with macros to perform remote
template injection, a technique that allows operators to obtain and launch a payload from a remote C2, often OneDrive.
Template injection is an attractive option for adversaries looking to execute malicious code without drawing scrutiny from
defenders. This technique can also be used to persist in a compromised environment if an adversary replaces a default
template used by a common application.
In these attacks, Microsoft has observed the Mint Sandstorm subgroup using CharmPower, a custom implant, in attacks
that began with targeted phishing campaigns.CharmPower is a modular backdoor written in PowerShell that this
subgroup delivers in phishing campaigns that rely on template injection. CharmPower can read files, gather information
on an infected host, and send details back to the attackers. Reporting from Checkpoint indicates that at least one version
of CharmPower pulls data from a specific text file that contains a hardcoded victim identifier.

What’s next
Capabilities observed in intrusions attributed to this Mint Sandstorm subgroup are concerning as they allow operators to
conceal C2 communication, persist in a compromised system, and deploy a range of post-compromise tools with varying
capabilities. While effects vary depending on the operators’ post-intrusion activities, even initial access can enable
unauthorized access and facilitate further behaviors that may adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of an environment. A successful intrusion creates liabilities and may harm an organization’s reputation, especially those
responsible for delivering services to others such as critical infrastructure providers, which Mint Sandstorm has targeted in
the past.
As these operators increasingly develop and use sophisticated capabilities, organizations must develop corresponding
defenses to harden their attack surfaces and raise costs for these operators. Microsoft will continue to monitor Mint
Sandstorm activity and implement protections for our customers. The current detections, advanced detections, and IOCs
in place across our security products are detailed below and shared with the broader security community to help detect
and prevent further attacks.

Mitigation and protection guidance
4/9

The techniques used by this subset of Mint Sandstorm can be mitigated through the following actions:

Hardening internet-facing assets and understanding your perimeter
Organizations must identify and secure perimeter systems that attackers might use to access the network. Public
scanning interfaces, such as Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management, can be used to improve data.
Vulnerabilities observed in recent campaigns attributed to this Mint Sandstorm subgroup that defenders can identify and
mitigate include:
IBM Aspera Faspex affected by CVE-2022-47986: Organizations can remediate CVE-2022-47986 by upgrading to
Faspex 4.4.2 Patch Level 2 or using Faspex 5.x which does not contain this vulnerability. More details are available
in IBM’s security advisory here.
Zoho ManageEngine affected by CVE-2022-47966: Organizations using Zoho ManageEngine products vulnerable
to CVE-2022-47966 should download and apply upgrades from the official advisory as soon as possible. Patching
this vulnerability is useful beyond this specific campaign as several adversaries are exploiting CVE-2022-47966 for
initial access.
Apache Log4j2 (aka Log4Shell) (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046): Microsoft’s guidance for organizations
using applications vulnerable to Log4Shell exploitation can be found here. This guidance is useful for any
organization with vulnerable applications and useful beyond this specific campaign, as several adversaries exploit
Log4Shell to obtain initial access.
This Mint Sandstorm subgroup has demonstrated its ability to rapidly adopt newly reported N-day vulnerabilities into its
playbooks. To further reduce organizational exposure, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers can use the threat and
vulnerability management capability to discover, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

Reducing the attack surface
Microsoft 365 Defender customers can also turn on attack surface reduction rules to harden their environments against
techniques used by this Mint Sandstorm subgroup. These rules, which can be configured by all Microsoft Defender
Antivirus customers and not just those using the EDR solution, offer significant protection against the tradecraft discussed
in this report.
Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion
Block Office applications from creating executable content
Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands
Additionally, in 2022, Microsoft changed the default behavior of Office applications to block macros in files from the
internet, further minimizing the attack surface for operators like this subgroup of Mint Sandstorm.
