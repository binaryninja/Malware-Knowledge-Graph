Executive summary
The ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation behind REvil have become one of the most prolific and
successful threat groups since the ransomware first appeared in May 2019. REvil has been primarily used
to target Windows systems. However, new samples have been identified targeting Linux systems. AT&T
Alien Labs™ is closely monitoring the ransomware landscape and has already identified four of these
samples in the wild during the last month, after receiving a tip from MalwareHuntingTeam. The purpose of
this blog is to share recent findings and a summary of the adversary, malware family, and detection
options.

Key Takeaways:
REvil ransomware authors have expanded their arsenal to include Linux ransomware, which allows
them to target ESXi and NAS devices.
The new Linux version has similarities to the Windows version, which has impacted companies such
as JBS, Acer, and Travelex, as already reported by the FBI and the media.

Background

1/8

REvil is also known as Sodinokibi or Sodin. It is a ransomware family operated as a ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS). Deployments of REvil were first observed in April 2019, exploiting a published vulnerability
in Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2019-2725). Since then, REvil has become one of the most prolific RaaS
groups, after being attributed ransom attacks to JBS, Acer, Travelex, and the most recent one U.K.-based
fashion brand French Connection this week.

Ransomware-as-a-service is a method for individuals to purchase prebuilt malware families for their own
malicious use. RaaS has been sold on the dark web and has been the approach used by a variety of other
criminal groups, such as DarkSide. One thing to keep in mind is RaaS is not limited to buyers who lack
their own capabilities. For example, a highly skilled adversarial team supporting a nation state could make
use of RaaS families to gain access into a targeted network to avoid pre- and post- compromise attribution
and objective identification.

Analysis
The threat actors behind REvil ransomware have expanded their arsenal to include Linux ransomware. As
announced on a dark web blog and reported by AdvIntel in early May 2021, REvil has ported their
Windows ransomware version to the Linux architecture.
These software upgrades follow the trend seen in other popular RaaS groups, like DarkSide, where they
have added Linux capabilities to include ESXi in their scope of potential targets. The hypervisor ESXi
allows multiple virtual machines (VM) to share the same hard drive storage. However, this also enables
attackers to encrypt the centralized virtual hard drives used to store data from across VMs, potentially
causing disruptions to companies. According to the blog post, in addition to targeting ESXi, REvil is also
targeting NAS devices as another storage platform with the potential to highly impact the affected
companies.
In late May 2021 the first REvil ransomware samples affecting *nix systems and ESXi were observed in the
wild. The samples are ELF64 executables, with similarities to the Windows REvil executable, being the
most noticeable among the configuration options.
Before encrypting all the files, REvil runs the esxcli command line tool to list all running ESXi VMs and
terminate them. By doing this, the attacker ensures no other VM is handling the files to be encrypted,
avoiding corruption issues of the encrypted files. However, the executable has a specific parameter to run
in silent mode, which avoids debugging without stopping any VMs.

In addition to the above-mentioned parameter, the threat actor can specify the number of threads to use
(the default value is 50) and the path to encrypt. (By default, the malware will encrypt the current directory
and its subfolders.)
During execution, the malware will first check if its configuration exists. The configuration file format is very
similar to the one observed for REvil Windows samples, but with fewer fields. Some of the fields presented
in both versions include:
Pk: Base64-encoded value containing the attacker's public key used to encrypt files
Sub: 7987 representing the affiliate identifier
Dbg: Determines if the victim is Russian, terminating the execution if the language set in the victim’s
system is not the expected one

Nbody: Ransom note body contents encoded in base64; decoded contents are shown in Figure 3
Nname: Ransom note filename
Rdmcnt: Unique value not previously seen in REvil configurations
Ext: Encrypted extension, which appears to be five random character; the observed extensions
include .rhkrc, .qoxaq, .naixq, and . 7rspj.

The malware will loop through the target folder, encrypting the files in it. Before encryption, it will check to
see if the file has already been encrypted by looking at the filename extension.
During encryption, the malware will generate a 64 bytes XOR key, based on the pk key given in the config
file. It will use this key during the encryption process. After encryption, the malware will write the generated
key “IV” at the end of each file and leave a ransom note in each folder.

The malware will log all the files it goes through, stating if the file was encrypted or if it was unable to
encrypt due to OS protection.

Conclusion
6/8

The threat actors behind REvil RaaS have rapidly developed a Linux version to compete against the
recently released Linux version of DarkSide. It is hard to clarify if these two RaaS are competing against
each other or collaborating team members, as stated by other security researchers. Nevertheless, both
actors have been very active in the ransomware landscape during the last months, and these upgrades will
keep them in the spotlight due to the increased attacking spectrum.
