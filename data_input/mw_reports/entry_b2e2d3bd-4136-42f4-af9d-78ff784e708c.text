Threat Thursday: Karma Ransomware

The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

Summary
Karma is fast-acting ransomware designed to quickly encrypt data on compromised machines. In
the wild since mid-2021, Karma initially used the stream cipher known as ChaCha20. Recent
samples have swapped this out for Salsa20, suggesting the malware is still under development.
The Karma ransom group has created a leak site named “Karma Leaks,” which is hosted via an
Onion page. This site has blog-like posts that allude to infiltration of an organization’s network
before deploying their ransomware, a technique which allows them to get a better sense of the
value of their victim’s data before setting a ransom amount. The group also uses this site as a
double-extortion ploy. Affected organizations that refuse to pay the ransom demands or that do not
pay within a specific time, have their data published.
In October 2021, Karma ransomware went through an iterative change, showing rapid
advancement including smaller sample-size and shifts in their encryption routine. Files encrypted
by the newest version of the ransomware have the file-extension [.KARMA_V2] appended, rather
than the initial [.KARMA] file-extension used in a previous version.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
Infection Vector
The infection vector used by the Karma ransomware gang is unknown, but based on initial findings
of reconnaissance performed on the victims by the threat group, it appears to vary. Once the group
has established a foothold, they likely attempt to move laterally and exfiltrate any data of value.
Once reconnaissance and information-stealing has concluded, they execute the Karma
ransomware to encrypt victim systems that they have compromised.

File Analysis
The ransomware file itself is small, with samples ranging between 15 KB and 130 KB. Despite their
small size, none of the samples found in the wild were packed by digital software packers. The
observed samples were all Windows® 32-bit Portable Executables (PE) with a compilation
timestamp of 2021. All samples found in the wild were compiled in Microsoft® Visual C++.
Though most samples of Karma are unsigned, lacking digital certificates, at least one known
sample was signed with a currently un-revoked digital signature.

Figure 1: Static information of Karma_V2 sample
As noted, Karma appears to be still under development. BlackBerry has observed a clear lateral
progression between initial samples of Karma, leading up to KARMA_V2. Over a short period of
time, the samples of Karma that have been analyzed became progressively smaller, shifted their
encryption routine, and increased in complexity.
The initial samples of Karma contained a console pop-up box during encryption, meaning an
attentive user could attempt to terminate the process before all their data was encrypted. However,
given the speed of the malware’s encryption routine, it would have been difficult to act quickly
enough to keep all data intact.

More recently, samples contain the static string: Karma_V2. These samples share a lot of
resemblance to the proceeding version, but the initial console box that was once displayed on the
victim device is no longer visible. Its speed and method of encryption appear the same.

Karma Mutex
Karma_V2, like the original, initially creates a mutex called “KARMA.” This functions as a buffer to
prevent another instance of the ransomware from being executed if one is already running. This is
likely done to prevent re-infection, as well as double-encryption that might occur if the ransomware
inadvertently executes twice.
If ransomware were to be executed twice on a system, doubly-encrypted data is likely to become
un-recoverable and corrupt. This would defeat the purpose of such malware demanding a payment
for decrypting and recovering the user’s data.

Figure 3: Formation of the "KARMA" mutex
Karma calls on the use of crypt32.dll. This Dynamic-Link Library (.DLL) is a native module used to
implement cryptographic messaging and certification functions with the Windows CryptoAPI. The
DLL is used during encryption.

4/16

Figure 4: crypt32.dll being loaded
After loading the DLL, the malware will then iterate through all available drives connected to the
victim’s device. If a logical drive is identified and verified, the malware will attempt to encrypt its
contents.

Encryption
Not all samples of Karma have the same goals. Though they all operate the same, they can target
different files and folders.
Karma samples vary in which file-extensions and folders they exclude from encrypting. This
information is statically hard-coded into the malware, located in the .rdata section of each sample.

These exclusions are likely included to avoid inadvertently encrypting core and critical Windows
components.

Once files are passed through the malware encryption routine, and the file-extension has been
appended, the malware will add the 8 bytes of data shown below to signify successful encryption.

Background Change
In all samples of Karma ransomware analyzed to date, once encryption is completed, the malware
creates a file called “background.jpg.” This file is generated and stored in the %Temp% directory.

Once the malware has carried out its encryption, it will change the victim’s desktop image as
shown below.

Figure 11: Example of Karma ransom note
There are few deviations in the Karma ransom note. However, the formatting is generally the same
across all versions.
Typically, the contents of these notes are Base-64 encoded and contained within the file’s static
strings. The contents are decoded into memory before being placed into the text file KARMAENCRYPTED.txt or KARMA-AGREE.txt. These ransom notes are created and dropped in all
folders where the malware has encrypted files.
The note contains an Onion link to the threat actor’s leak site. It also contains unique email
addresses related to that specific sample of Karma.
These addresses often follow a pattern of containing at least one of each of the following email
services:
OnionMail
Tutanota
ProtonMail

Leak Site
While other prevalent ransomware threats have been observed selling their malicious code to
other threat actors as Ransomware-as-a-Service offerings, Karma appears to be used solely by its
own creators.
Since Karma began posting to its Onion webpage in May 2021, the ransomware threat actors have
been busy populating their basic WordPress site with the names and data of victims who have
refused to pay their ransom.

11/16

Figure 12: Current content of “Karma Leaks” website (redacted)
As of November 2021, the site hosts the data of four victims who have not engaged or contacted
the group and therefore have had their data publicly leaked. Each post shown in Figure 12
contains multiple links to download confidential information stolen by the threat actors. The site
suggests that these “double-extortion” posts would be removed if a fee is paid, which means that
the true number of victims who have fallen to Karma may extend beyond this initial tally.
It appears that the Karma ransomware gang tends to target large multinational organizations; in
particular, those with more than 1,000 employees and around $1 billion in revenue.

12/16

Figure 13: Karma leak site’s “About” page text
Karma’s website has a few blog-like posts about potential victims they intend to leak data from
soon, and further ways to contact the gang. The “About" page shares a few additional pieces of
information, as seen in Figure 13.
Neither the ransom note nor the website publicly discloses a specific ransom amount. Typically,
ransomware would immediately demand a victim-specific fee or a flat-rate fee for the decryption of
files.
As the Karma ransomware gang likely infiltrates organizations directly, as opposed to an RaaS
model, fees could vary based on not just on the damage caused by the ransomware, but on the
victim’s ability to pay and criticality of the affected data.

Conclusion
Karma ransomware is a quickly evolving and ruthless operation. Though Karma shares a lot of
similarities with other known ransomware families, its rapid development and advancement in
techniques makes both the malware and the threat actor behind it extremely dangerous. The use
of “Karma Leaks” as a double-extortion ploy shows the threat group’s willingness to expose victims
who do not pay.
With both the activity on “Karma Leaks” and the development of KARMA_V2, it appears this threat
actor is spinning up its operations, and that it is actively looking for large organizations to target
next.
