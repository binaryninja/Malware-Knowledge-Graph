Threat Research
By Rommel Abraham D Joven | June 03, 2016
Fortiguard’s behavior-based system designed to identify new malware has detected a
German targeted ransomware. We named it Herbst, a German word which in English means
Autumn.

Ransom Note
The Herbst ransom note appears in German in a dedicated window from its own running
process. It demands that a ransom be paid in bitcoin. We have also been able to determine
the bitcoin address. Ransome note details are listed below:

1/6

File encryption: AES 256 bit
Ransom Price: 0.1 Bitcoin or approximately USD $53.80 as of today.
Bitcoin Address: 18uM9JA1dZgvsgAaeeW2XZK13dTbk1jzWq

Key Preparation
The key is prepared by concatenating two random numbers from 0 to 99999999. Next, it
concatenates strings in random positions from the text variable, text.length times, as seen
below. This key is hashed later and used as the AES key.

Targeted Directories
After preparing the key, Herbst proceeds to enumerate files from the StartupPath. It encrypts
all kinds of files in this directory, as shown by “*.*”.
It encrypts file in the following special folders:
Desktop, MyPictures, MyMusic, and Personal

Encrypted File
The ransomware encrypts files and appends the extension to .herbst.

File Encryption
The encryption starts by reading the file and calling the function AES_Encrypt.

Figure 05: Encryption Function
The malware then proceeds to hash the key generated from the previous function, and this is
used as the AES key for encrypting the files. After the file is encrypted with AES 256 bit, the
malware then converts it to Base64String.

Unfinished Business
This malware, written in C#, shows it’s unfinished because it has the following functions, but
never calls them in the main function:
Encrypt – believed to be the function in encrypting the AES key used before sending to
the Command and Control (C&C.)
Unlock – believed to be the decryption of the incoming traffic from the C&C.
Http – believed to be used to send and receive encrypted messages to the C&C.

5/6

Figure 08: Malware Functions
Yes, the malware encrypts files and shows the decryption note; however ,it doesn’t send the
AES key used to its C&C, and doesn’t verify the transaction ID when used in the ransom
window, making this an unfinished ransomware.

Conclusion
Our analysis shows that cybercriminals could be cooking a ransomware targeting a German
audience. From the analysis, we conclude that Herbst is a beta version which is still under
development. The malware doesn’t provide any details on its C&Cs because it doesn’t call
the HTTP function. We speculate that this version could just be a test to check AV vendors’
ability to detect it without giving away their C&C.
Fortiguard will continue to monitor Herbst future activities and developments.
