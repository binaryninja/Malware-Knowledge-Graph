Newly-discovered variants of an Android spyware that previously was attributed to an
advanced persistent threat actor group called C-23 (also known as GnatSpy, FrozenCell, or
VAMP) have incorporated new features into their malicious apps that make them more
resilient to actions by users, who might try to remove them manually, and to security and web
hosting companies that attempt to block access to, or shut down, their command-and-control
server domains.
The C-23 threat actor has, in the past, targeted individuals based in the Middle East,
particularly in the Palestinian Territories. The group has been active since at least 2017.

The spyware app initially

disguises itself as something called “App Updates”
The new variants appear in the form of an app that purports to install updates on the target’s
phone, with names that include App Updates, System Apps Updates, or Android Update
Intelligence. Sophos suspects that the apps are delivered to specific users by means of
SMS text messages linking to downloads. To the best of our knowledge, none of the apps
have been hosted on Google Play Store, though Sophos did reach out to the Android
security team and sent details about the apps to the company.
Once installed, the spyware sends unique, identifiable device parameters to its commandand-control server. One of the newer features of this variant is that it will, initially, use a
hardcoded C2 address to communicate, but also contains code that allows the operators of
the spyware to push down a new address. This ability can keep the malware functional if one
or more of the C2 server domains is taken down. The new variants did not conceal or
obfuscate the C2 server address in any way.

Code that

can modify the C2 domain on a running installation is a notable new feature
Many of the new variants were found to have been digitally signed by a certificate (with serial
number ece521e38c5e9cbea53503eaef1a6ddd204583fa) that Sophos has associated with
malware for years.

Changing disguises after installation
The first time the user opens the app, it requests that the user grant the app specific
permissions to do the kinds of things you’d expect spyware to do: It requests permissions to
record ambient audio, and to access all files stored on the device.

But

the apps also use a bit of social engineering to ask the user to grant advanced permissions:
notification access, device administrator, and the ability to observe the user’s actions while
interacting with apps.
The app’s requests appear to justify the need for the additional features, but they’re lies. For
instance, the request to “Enable Notifications” claims that the app needs this functionality or
else “you won’t receive notifications in real time.”

But that isn’t what Notification Access

permissions do. When prompted to enable this feature, the app pushes the user to a system
permissions window that accurately describes what the permission does. The threat actors
may assume that the target won’t carefully read, or understand, the consequences of clicking
Allow on this screen.

4/13

This

permission grants the spyware the ability to read the full-text messages and the names of
contacts, from any app, such as Facebook or WhatsApp, as well as dismissing notifications
from other apps (such as a mobile anti-malware app’s warnings) or toggling the Do Not
Disturb settings on the phone. The device administrator permission gives the operator of the
app the ability to lock the phone, but according to our analysis, the spyware’s current version
has no capability to do this.

5/13

The app prompts the user to Enable the device admin permission or “system won’t secure
your internet connection.”

In reality, the feature the spyware wants the user

to enable would let the spyware lock the phone.

The final prompt

asks the user to change a setting with a vague warning about something being blocked as a
result of battery optimization.

6/13

Like the other

prompts, this is also bogus. This prompt redirects the user to enable a feature that permits
the spyware to identify what apps you use, when you’re using them. The spyware sends that
information onward to its C2 server.

7/13

Once the target has granted all these permissions, the app disguises itself to evade any
attempts at manual removal by the user. The method to attain stealth appears to be new to
this version: the spyware changes its icon (and name) to disguise itself using an icon of one
of the four apps: or Botim (a VOIP calling app).

Once this happens, the next time the spyware app is opened, the spyware opens the real
app whose disguise it wears, i.e., it opens Chrome if it disguises itself as Chrome, thereby
giving an illusion to the user that the app is legit.

The spyware app icon

appears as “App Updates” before the change…

9/13

…and afterward takes

on the icon of the Chrome browser, and launches that app when the user clicks the icon.
The apps contain a text string, in the Arabic language, that they send to the command and
control server when the icon has been changed. These strings are present in these new
versions of the malware.

We also found that it tried to install its own version of Botim from the application’s assets – a
functionality we believe was meant for future versions, as the samples did not contain (or try
to download) any Botim APK file.
Each functionality of the spyware has a command associated with it. The commands are
received via Firebase messaging, and the spyware performs the corresponding function as
and when instructed.

The live C2 servers posed as websites for Laravel – a web application framework.

C2 website posed as website for Laravel (a web application framework)
Yet many of the functionalities of the spyware remain unchanged. The app does the following
things:
Collects SMS, contacts, call logs
Collects images and documents
Recording audio, incoming and outgoing calls, including WhatsApp calls
Taking screenshots and recording video of the screen
Taking pictures using the camera
Hiding its own icon
Reading notifications from WhatsApp, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Telegram,
Skype, IMO Messenger, or Signal
Canceling notifications from built-in security apps (such as Samsung
SecurityLogAgent, Xiaomi MIUI SecurityCenter, Huawei SystemManager), as well as
from Android system apps, package Installer, and its own notifications

Internal logging shows the app writing out the contents of the contact list, call logs, and SMS
messages to a Zip archive it later uploads to its C2

Don’t be a spyware victim
To avoid falling prey to such malicious apps, users should only install apps from trusted
sources such as Google Play. Updating Android OS and applications should be done via
Android Settings and Google Play respectively, instead of relying on a third-party app.
Users should be particularly wary of apps asking for sensitive permissions such as device
admin, notification access, or those requiring superuser/root access. Users can view the
apps currently having device admin and notification access permissions by browsing to
Settings and searching for “Device admin apps” and “Notification access” respectively.

Detections and acknowledgments
We also advise users to consider installing an antivirus app on their mobile device such as
Sophos Intercept X for Mobile that defends their device and data from such threats.
SophosLabs has published indicators of compromise on its Github page. These samples are
detected by Sophos Intercept X for Mobile as Andr/Spy-BFI.
SophosLabs would like to acknowledge that @malwrhunterteam initially alerted us to some
of the samples in this post. Andrew Brandt conducted additional research for this article.
