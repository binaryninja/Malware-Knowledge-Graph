A few months ago we received a sample from a customer that turned out to be a password
stealer (PWS). One thing about this malware stood out: the subdirectory used in the access
panel URL. It contained the string “***=**U=TEAM” (which we have obfuscated). Our
investigations lead us to believe this may be a case of industrial espionage.

The actors use compromised websites to host their access panels. Luckily for us they made
a mistake and left the ZIP file they dropped on the compromised site.

This enabled us to see how the back-end of the panel works. The Zip file contains five files:

The three files of interest are config.php, index.php, and install.php.
Config.php contains the password for the MySQL server they will set up.

Install.php creates the database and sets up the panel to store the passwords stolen by the
malware. We found the following snippet in the code:

We did some searching and found that “Bilal Ghouri” was originally responsible for the PHP
back-end of the popular PWS Hackhound Stealer, which was released in 2009.
We also found this warning at the end of the code:

Surely they would have remembered to delete this file!

The most important file is index.php. This file is responsible for storing the passwords
uploaded by the malware and also enables the actors to search and export the data.

It is interesting that the script checks for a specific user agent, “HardCore Software For :
Public.”

This user agent is used by the malware when uploading the stolen data. The PHP script
checks if the user agent matches the hardcoded one before allowing any data to be
uploaded.

The malware in use is ISR Stealer, a modified version of Hackhound Stealer. Our findings
are confirmed by the comments in the preceding PHP code.
The PWS targets the following applications:
Internet Explorer
Firefox
Chrome
Opera
Safari
Yahoo Messenger
MSN Messenger
Pidgin
FileZilla
Internet Download Manager
JDownloader

The following screen of the original Hackhound Stealer shows options for building the
malware:

This screen of the ISR Stealer builder was used by the actors behind the campaign.

ISR Stealer uses two executables to gather passwords stored on the machine: Mail
PassView and WebBrowserPassView, both by Nirsoft. These apps gather passwords stored
in mail clients and web browsers. Both of these files reside in the resources of the ISR
Stealer. The panel location is also stored in the malware’s resources, in a simple encrypted
form with SUB 0x02.

An encrypted URL.

A decrypted URL.
We did some more digging and found that the actors responsible for this malware have been
active since the beginning of 2016, with the first sample spotted in the wild in January.
The following spear-phishing emails were sent to entice targets to download and execute the
PWS:

The actors have been busy for several weeks, although we saw no activity during the Easter
holiday. After “Easter break,” we noticed that they had slightly changed the panel. It now
includes the string “Powered By NEW LINE OF *** **U TEAMS VERSION 2.1.”

7/14

One compromised website had more than 10 access panels receiving stolen passwords from
the PWS. We observed that some of the targets of the spear phishing are companies
that deal with machinery parts. The actors used some of the following filenames:
(RFQ__1045667machine-oil valves).exe
ButterflyCheckVALVES.exe
BALL VALVE BIDDING.exe
RFQ BALL VALVE.exe
Ball Valves with BSPP conection.exe
These names lead us to believe that industrial espionage might be a motive of the actors.

8/14

We have also noticed that they are attaching the malware with a “.z” extension. This is likely
because some popular ZIP file handlers will associate this file extension with their programs
and allow users to extract it. Using .z also bypasses some popular cloud email file
restrictions.

9/14

We contacted the website owners used by the actors and informed them of the compromise
so that they could remove the panels.
Prevention
McAfee detects this threat as PWS-FCGH. We advise you block .z file extensions at the
gateway level. This step will prevent other malware from using this technique in their
phishing campaigns.
