Strengthening Security Configurations to Defend Against
Attackers Targeting Cloud Services
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-013a

Summary
This Analysis Report uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common
Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all
referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is aware of several recent
successful cyberattacks against various organizations’ cloud services. Threat actors are
using phishing and other vectors to exploit poor cyber hygiene practices within a victims’
cloud services configuration. The information in this report is derived exclusively from several
CISA incident response engagements and provides the tactics, techniques, and procedures;
indicators of compromise (IOCs) that CISA observed as part of these engagements; and
recommended mitigations for organization to strengthen their cloud environment
configuration to protect against, detect, and respond to potential attacks.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see AR21-013A.stix.
Note: the activity and information in this Analysis Report is not explicitly tied to any one
threat actor or known to be specifically associated with the advanced persistent threat actor
attributed with the compromise of SolarWinds Orion Platform software and other recent
activity.

Description
Background
These types of attacks frequently occurred when victim organizations’ employees worked
remotely and used a mixture of corporate laptops and personal devices to access their
respective cloud services. Despite the use of security tools, affected organizations typically
had weak cyber hygiene practices that allowed threat actors to conduct successful attacks.
Technical Details
The cyber threat actors involved in these attacks used a variety of tactics and techniques—
including phishing, brute force login attempts, and possibly a “pass-the-cookie” attack—to
attempt to exploit weaknesses in the victim organizations’ cloud security practices.
Phishing

1/5

CISA observed cyber threat actors using phishing emails with malicious links to harvest
credentials for users’ cloud service accounts (Phishing: Spearphishing Link [T1598.003]).
The cyber actors designed emails that included a link to what appeared to be a secure
message and also emails that looked like a legitimate file hosting service account login. After
a targeted recipient provided their credentials, the threat actors then used the stolen
credentials to gain Initial Access [TA0001] to the user’s cloud service account (Valid
Accounts [T1078]). CISA observed the actors’ logins originating from foreign locations
(although the actors could have been using a proxy or The Onion Router (Tor) to obfuscate
their location). The actors then sent emails from the user’s account to phish other accounts
within the organization. In some cases, these emails included links to documents within what
appeared to be the organization’s file hosting service.
In one case, an organization did not require a virtual private network (VPN) for accessing the
corporate network. Although their terminal server was located within their firewall, due to
remote work posture, the terminal server was configured with port 80 open to allow remote
employees to access it—leaving the organization’s network vulnerable. The threat actor
attempted to exploit this by launching brute force login attempts (Brute Force [T1110]).
Forwarding Rules

In several engagements, CISA observed threat actors collecting sensitive information by
taking advantage of email forwarding rules, which users had set up to forward work emails to
their personal email accounts (Email Collection: Email Forwarding Rule [T1114.003]).
Modified Forwarding
In one case, CISA determined that the threat actors modified an existing email rule on a
user’s account—originally set by the user to forward emails sent from a certain sender to a
personal account—to redirect the emails to an account controlled by the actors. The threat
actors updated the rule to forward all email to the threat actors’ accounts.
Keyword Search Rule
Threat actors also modified existing rules to search users’ email messages (subject and
body) for several finance-related keywords (which contained spelling mistakes) and forward
the emails to the threat actors’ account.
New Rule Creation and Forwarding
In addition to modifying existing user email rules, the threat actors created new mailbox rules
that forwarded certain messages received by the users (specifically, messages with certain
phishing-related keywords) to the legitimate users’ Really Simple Syndication (RSS) Feeds
or RSS Subscriptions folder in an effort to prevent warnings from being seen by the
legitimate users.
Authentication
2/5

CISA verified that the threat actors successfully signed into one user’s account with proper
multi-factor authentication (MFA). In this case, CISA believes the threat actors may have
used browser cookies to defeat MFA with a “pass-the-cookie” attack (Use Alternate
Authentication Material: Web Session Cookie [T1550.004]).
The threat actors attempted brute force logins (Brute Force [T1110]) on some accounts.
However, this activity was not successful. This thwarted attempt was due, in part, to the
threat actors not guessing a correct username/password combination, as well as the
organization’s use of MFA to access their cloud environment.

Solution
CISA recommends the following steps for organizations to strengthen their cloud security
practices.
Implement conditional access (CA) policies based upon your organization's needs.
Establish a baseline for normal network activity within your environment.
Routinely review both Active Directory sign-in logs and unified audit logs for anomalous
activity.
Enforce MFA.
Routinely review user-created email forwarding rules and alerts, or restrict forwarding.
Have a mitigation plan or procedures in place; understand when, how, and why to reset
passwords and to revoke session tokens.
Follow recommend guidance on securing privileged access.
Consider a policy that does not allow employees to use personal devices for work. At a
minimum, use a trusted mobile device management solution.
Resolve client site requests internal to your network.
Consider restricting users from forwarding emails to accounts outside of your domain.
Allow users to consent only to app integrations that have been pre-approved by an
administrator.
Audit email rules with enforceable alerts via the Security and Compliance Center or
other tools that use the Graph API to warn administrators to abnormal activity.
Implement MFA for all users, without exception.
Conditional access should be understood and implemented with a zero-trust mindset.
Ensure user access logging is enabled. Forward logs to a security information and
event management appliance for aggregation and monitoring so as to not lose visibility
on logs outside of logging periods.
Use a CA policy to block legacy authentication protocols.
Verify that all cloud-based virtual machine instances with a public IP do not have open
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports. Place any system with an open RDP port
behind a firewall and require users to use a VPN to access it through the firewall.

3/5

Focus on awareness and training. Make employees aware of the threats—such as
phishing scams—and how they are delivered. Additionally, provide users training on
information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging
cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.
Establish blame-free employee reporting and ensure that employees know who to
contact when they see suspicious activity or when they believe they have been a victim
of a cyberattack. This will ensure that the proper established mitigation strategy can be
employed quickly and efficiently.
Ensure existing built-in filtering and detection products (e.g., those for spam, phishing,
malware, and safe attachments and links are enabled.
Organizations using M365 should also consider the following steps.
Assign a few (one to three) trusted users as electronic discovery (or eDiscovery)
managers to conduct forensic content searches across the entire M365
environment (Mailboxes, Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive) for evidence of
malicious activity.
Disable PowerShell remoting to Exchange Online for regular M365 users.
Disabling for non-administrative users will lower the likelihood of a compromised
user account being used to programmatically access tenant configurations for
reconnaissance.
Do not allow an unlimited amount of unsuccessful login attempts. To configure
these settings, see password smart lockout configuration and sign-in activity
reports.
Consider using a tool such as Sparrow or Hawk—open-source PowerShell-based
tools used to gather information related to M365—to investigate and audit
intrusions and potential breaches.[1][2]
