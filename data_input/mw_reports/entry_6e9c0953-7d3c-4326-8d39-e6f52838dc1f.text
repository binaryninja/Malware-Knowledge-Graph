Entirely new malware family discovered by ESET researchers

ESET researchers have discovered a new family of Android RATs (Remote Administration
Tools), that has been abusing the Telegram protocol for command and control, and data
exfiltration.
Investigating what at first seemed like increased activity on the part of the previously
reported IRRAT and TeleRAT, we identified an entirely new malware family that has been
spreading since at least August 2017. In March 2018, its source code was made available
for free on Telegram hacking channels, and as a result, hundreds of parallel variants of the
malware have been circulating in the wild.
One of these variants is different from the rest – despite the freely available source code, it
is offered for sale on a dedicated Telegram channel, marketed under the name HeroRat. It
is available in three pricing models according to functionality, and comes with a support
video channel. It is unclear whether this variant was created from the leaked source code,
or if it is the “original” whose source code was leaked.

How does it operate?
Attackers lure victims into downloading the RAT by spreading it under various attractivesounding guises, via third-party app stores, social media and messaging apps. We’ve seen
the malware distributed mostly in Iran, as apps promising free bitcoins, free internet
connections, and additional followers on social media. The malware has not been seen on
Google Play.

The malware runs on all Android versions: however, affected users need to accept
permissions required by the app (sometimes including activating the app as device
administrator), which is where social engineering comes into play.

After the malware is installed and launched on the victim’s device, a small popup appears,
claiming the app can’t run on the device and will therefore be uninstalled. In the variants we
analyzed, the fake uninstall message can be displayed in English or Persian, depending on
the target device‘s language settings.
After the uninstallation is seemingly completed, the app’s icon disappears. On the attacker’s
side, however, a new victimized device has just been registered.

Having gained access to the victim’s device, the attacker then leverages Telegram’s bot
functionality to control the newly listed device. Each compromised device is controlled via a
bot, set up and operated by the attacker using the Telegram app.
The malware has a wide array of spying and file exfiltration capabilities, including
intercepting text messages and contacts, sending text messages and making calls, audio
and screen recording, obtaining device location, and controlling the device’s settings.
HeroRat’s functionality is divided into three “bundles” – bronze, silver and gold panels –
offered for sale for 25, 50, and 100 USD, respectively. The source code itself is offered for
650 USD by HeroRat’s (ambitious) author.
The malware’s capabilities are accessible in the form of clickable buttons in the Telegram
bot interface. Attackers can control victimized devices by simply tapping the buttons
available in the version of the malware they are operating.

Unlike the Telegram-abusing Android RATs previously analyzed, which are written in
standard Android Java, this newly-discovered malware family has been developed from
scratch in C# using the Xamarin framework – a rare combination for Android malware.
The way the malware communicates via the Telegram protocol has been adapted to its
programming language – instead of the Telegram Bot API leveraged by the RATs previously
described, this malware family uses Telesharp, a library for creating Telegram bots with C#.
Communicating commands to and exfiltrating data from the compromised devices are both
covered entirely via the Telegram protocol – a measure aimed at avoiding detection based
on traffic to known upload servers.

How to stay safe
With the malware’s source code recently made available for free, new mutations could be
developed and deployed anywhere in the world. Since the distribution method and form of
disguise of this malware varies case by case, checking your device for the presence of any
specific applications is not enough to tell if your device has been compromised.
If you have reason to believe your device has been compromised by this malware, scan it
using a reliable mobile security solution. ESET systems detect and block this threat as
Android/Spy.Agent.AMS and Android/Agent.AQO.
To avoid falling victim to Android malware, stick to the official Google Play store when
downloading apps, make sure to read user reviews before downloading anything to your
device and pay attention to what permissions you grant to apps both before and after
installation.
