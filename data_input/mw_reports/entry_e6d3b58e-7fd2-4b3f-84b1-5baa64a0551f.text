Overview

APT34 is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, active since 2014. This group works
on behalf of the Iranian government and has been observed targeting victims mostly across
the Middle Eastern region. They have targeted a variety of industries, including financial,
government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has primarily focused its
operations within the Middle East. This adversary was originally identified and tracked as two
separate groups, OilRig and APT34. But further research and evidence revealed an overlap
between their activities, and eventually, most researchers agreed to track them as a single
Threat Actor. Most recently in mid-2019, Turla (Cyber-espionage group from Russia)
hijacked the Infrastructure of this APT, in one of their attack campaigns.

Which organizations have they targeted?

The group was initially observed targeting financial organizations and government agencies
across the Middle Eastern region and the US, but gradually it moved to other regions and
sectors.
Since 2014, the group’s attacks were focused on Middle Eastern banks and
government entities since 2014. Later, their primary targets changed, but the trend of
targeting critical infrastructure and governmental entities remained the same.
In October 2016, the group was observed to be targeting government entities in Middle
Eastern countries and the U.S., along with several airlines from Middle Eastern
countries.
Between 2017 to 2018, the group focused more on Western-Asian and North American
organizations working in Education, Information Technology and Government sector.
In April 2019, information leaked by elite hackers “Lab Dookhtegan” and “Mr_L4nnist3r”
revealed the victim’s names as the Saudi Arabian Communications & Information
Technology Commission, Dubai Statistics Association.
In the same duration, a small handful of targets were based outside the Middle East,
including a telecom company in Zimbabwe, government bodies in Albania, and South
Korean gaming business.
Most recently in June 2019, a phishing campaign was observed, targeting energy
companies, government utilities, and their workers.

What is their motivation behind the attacks?

This group is known to use various malware and tools to collect strategic information that
would benefit the economic and geopolitical interests of the state of Iran. Also, Iran considers
cyber-attacks as an offensive weapon against its rival countries like the United States of
America and Israel. The cyberattacks linked to the group are not that advanced or
sophisticated, but highly persistent with their victim choice, which is directly or indirectly
connected to Iran’s military, financial, and political interests.

Modus Operandi

3/17

Since 2014, the group is known to be using Microsoft Excel macros, PowerShell-based
exploits, and social engineering to gain access to its targets. They use phishing emails to
deliver weaponized Microsoft Excel documents, and most of their malware infect the target
system with VisualBasic and PowerShell (.ps1) scripts.
Between 2014 to 2016, the group's attack campaigns targeted banks and technology
organizations in Saudi Arabia with phishing emails that included weaponized Microsoft
Excel attachments. One spam email had a legitimate conversation between
employees, which was used as a lure, and forwarded to other employees with a
weaponized attachment. Other related campaign phishing emails used job or service
offering.
In early-2017, the group was observed again, using a fake Juniper Networks VPN
portal and few fake University of Oxford websites to deliver malware to the victims. The
group registered four domain names belonging to Oxford University (including oxfordcareers[.]com, oxford[.]in and oxford-employee[.]com).
In April 2017, they launched a massive cyber-espionage campaign against major
Israeli institutions and government officials. They exploited CVE-2017-0199 remote
code execution vulnerability in the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)
application programming interface. They managed to target the victims before
Microsoft issued a security update, and organizations rolled out the patch.
In May 2017, they expanded their geographical range with hundreds of new attacks
targeting several militaries, financial and energy businesses in Europe as well as the
United States. In these attacks, they collaborated with Russian hackers-for-hire.
In Sep. 2017, an analysis done by a security firm on Two-face (web shell) disclosed a
complex malicious infrastructure that was targeting Israeli institutions earlier in April.
The links between TwoFace and five other web shells were found, including
RunningBee, PuTTY Link (plink) and RGDoor (for Microsoft IIS).
In Oct. 2017, the group developed the "Agent Injector" (Trojan with the specific purpose
of installing the ISMAgent backdoor) to target an organization within the United Arab
Emirates government. The attack used a spearphishing spam email that had a subject
of ‘Importan Issue'. The group was also found to be using CVE-2017-11882, an Office
vulnerability patched by Microsoft on November 14, 2017.
On January 8, 2018, the group launched an attack on an insurance agency based in
the Middle East. They tried to deliver a new Trojan called OopsIE, via using a variant of
the ThreeDollars delivery document. They sent two emails to two separate email
addresses within the same organization. The email address was linked with the
Lebanese domain of a major global financial institution.
In Feb 2018, it was discovered that threat actor dubbed ‘Chafer’ (having an association
or related to APT34) successfully compromised one of the biggest telecom firms in the
Middle East using leaked NSA hacking tools.

4/17

In March 2018, the group improved their Critical Infrastructure attacks with new off-theshelf tools, dual-purpose utilities. They were found to be using earlier unseen malware,
that uses SmartFile, Google Drive, and internet server API (ISAPI) filters for
compromising Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers.
In July 2018, they launched multiple attacks using spearphishing email (having
attached PhpSpy and QuadAgent backdoor) to target an unnamed technology services
provider, the Lebanese intelligence agency, and healthcare facilities in Saudi Arabia.
Their initial infection paths were based on watering hole attacks using compromised
web servers. In Sep., they deployed a new variant of their OopsIE Trojan that came
with new evasion techniques.
In the same month, they also conducted at least one attack campaign containing an
updated variant of the BondUpdater Trojan (uses DNS tunneling) as its final payload.
In Nov. 2018, new information shed light on the fact that the group tests their malicious
documents before they are being used in their attacks.
In April 2019, a group that calls itself Lab Dookhtegan exposed several tools (Poison
Frog, Glimpse, HyperShell, HighShell, Fox Panel, and Webmask) used by this group.
In the same month, a DNSpionage malware campaign was also discovered, using a
new malware called 'Karkoff.' The malware was delivered via an Excel document that
included malicious macros. They also created a new remote administration tool that
supported HTTP and DNS communication.
Most recently in June 2019, a Russian cyber-espionage group "Turla" was discovered
to be using attack infrastructure belonging to APT34. The infrastructure was used to
deliver a backdoor called "Neptun," installed on Microsoft Exchange servers.
Also in June, a phishing campaign was observed asking victims to join their social
network. This time the group masqueraded as a Cambridge University lecturer, also
setting up a LinkedIn page in order to gain victims’ trust. From there they asked victims
to open malicious documents. In this phishing campaign, three new malware families
were detected, named as Pickpocket, ValueVault, and Longwatch.

Attribution

6/17

The use of infrastructure linked to Iranian operations, alignment, and timing with the national
interests of Iran lead to the conclusion that this group acts or works on behalf of the Iranian
government. The persistency in the targets of their attack, which are mostly from middle-east
countries, also proves the fact that the cyberattacks originated from Iran. Most of their cyber
campaigns became active when there was a holiday in Iran, and targeted specific countries
with conflict of interest with Iran.

Prevention

Organizations and security experts should review the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and
use them with their Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool. Organizations should also
consider having threat intel ingestion for their existing investments in the stack of security
tools like Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), etc. with support
for automated enrichment from external sources, which would ensure protection from latest
threats across the industry. The security experts must understand the fact that fully up-todate antivirus (AV) or reliable antivirus software do not provide 100% protection against
sophisticated attacks from threats like APT34. For adequate protection, they need a layered
approach to their endpoint security. Ideally, these layers must combine solutions based on
dynamic security policy (e.g., behavioral-based Firewalls, Data Loss Prevention systems) as
well as the control-based security policy (e.g., whitelisting, application control). Enterprise
networks with endpoint security solutions based on the OS-Centric security approach are
more secure against the new types of APT34 attacks. The OS-centric security solutions
focus on the final stage of the attack kill chain, and intended damage, so it provides better
protection no matter what attack vector or method is used.
