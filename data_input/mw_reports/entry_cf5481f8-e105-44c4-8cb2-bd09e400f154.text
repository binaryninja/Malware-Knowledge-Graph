Mandiant Threat Intelligence recently promoted a threat cluster to a named FIN (or financially
motivated) threat group for the first time since 2017. We have detailed FIN11's various
tactics, techniques and procedures in a report that is available now by signing up
for Mandiant Advantage Free.
In some ways, FIN11 is reminiscent of APT1; they are notable not for their sophistication, but
for their sheer volume of activity. There are significant gaps in FIN11’s phishing operations,
but when active, the group conducts up to five high-volume campaigns a week. While many
financially motivated threat groups are short lived, FIN11 has been conducting these
widespread phishing campaigns since at least 2016. From 2017 through 2018, the threat
group primarily targeted organizations in the financial, retail, and hospitality sectors.
However, in 2019 FIN11’s targeting expanded to include a diverse set of sectors and
geographic regions. At this point, it would be difficult to name a client that FIN11 hasn’t
targeted.

Mandiant has also responded to numerous FIN11 intrusions, but we’ve only observed the
group successfully monetize access in few instances. This could suggest that the actors cast
a wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further exploit
based on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security posture. Recently,
FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish exfiltrated data to
pressure victims into paying ransom demands. The group’s shifting monetization methods—
from point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware in 2019, and hybrid extortion in
2020—is part of a larger trend in which criminal actors have increasingly focused on postcompromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion.

Notably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security researchers call TA505, but we do
not attribute TA505’s early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names
interchangeably. Attribution of both historic TA505 activity and more recent FIN11 activity is
complicated by the actors’ use of criminal service providers. Like most financially motivated
actors, FIN11 doesn’t operate in a vacuum. We believe that the group has used services that
provide anonymous domain registration, bulletproof hosting, code signing certificates, and
private or semi-private malware. Outsourcing work to these criminal service providers likely
enables FIN11 to increase the scale and sophistication of their operations.

TTPs, and monetization methods, register for Mandiant Advantage Free. The full FIN11
report is also available through our FireEye Intelligence Portal (FIP). Then for even more
information, register for our exclusive webinar on Oct. 29 where Mandiant threat intelligence
experts will take a deeper dive into FIN11, including its origins, tactics, and potential for
future activity.
