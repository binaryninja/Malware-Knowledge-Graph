KIEV/MILAN (Reuters) - A power blackout in Ukraine’s capital Kiev last month was caused
by a cyber attack and investigators are trying to trace other potentially infected computers
and establish the source of the breach, utility Ukrenergo told Reuters on Wednesday.

When the lights went out in northern Kiev on Dec. 17-18, power supplier Ukrenergo
suspected a cyber attack and hired investigators to help it determine the cause following a
series of breaches across Ukraine.

Preliminary findings indicate that workstations and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) systems, linked to the 330 kilowatt sub-station “North”, were influenced by external
sources outside normal parameters, Ukrenergo said in comments emailed to Reuters.
“The analysis of the impact of symptoms on the initial data of these systems indicates a
premeditated and multi-level invasion,” Ukrenergo said.
Law enforcement officials and cyber experts are still working to compile a chronology of
events, draw up a list of compromised accounts, and determine the penetration point, while
tracing computers potentially infected with malware in sleep mode, it said.
The comments make no mention of which individual, group or country may have been
behind the attack.
“It was an intentional cyber incident not meant to be on a large scale... they actually attacked
more but couldn’t achieve all their goals,” said Marina Krotofil, lead cyber-security researcher
at Honeywell, who assisted in the investigation.
In December 2015, a first-of-its-kind cyber attack cut the lights to 225,000 people in western
Ukraine, with hackers also sabotaging power distribution equipment, complicating attempts
to restore power.
Ukrainian security services blamed that attack on Russia.
In the latest attack, hackers are thought to have hidden in Ukrenergo’s IT network
undetected for six months, acquiring privileges to access systems and figure out their
workings, before taking methodical steps to take the power offline, Krotofil said.
“The team involved had quite a few people working in it, with very serious tools and an
engineer who understands the power infrastructure,” she said.
The attacks against Ukraine’s power grid are widely seen by experts as the first examples of
hackers shutting off critical energy systems supplying heat and light to millions of homes.
