inconsistent methodologies, poor clustering, and lack of collaboration, the word ‘Winnti’ has
gradually been rendered meaningless.
We first heard the word ‘Winnti’ used to describe some specific attributes or actions: a
malware family, stolen code signing certificates, rootkits, malware associated with suspected
Chinese hacking, links to some specific Chinese personas (using hacker handles that spoke
Chinese and claimed to live in China), and some specific targeting.
Seven years and a dozen studies later, we ended up with a name linked to at least 15 other
names, some of which are likely to be separate groups. We’re at the point where Winnti
doesn’t clearly represent any particular targeting, tools or techniques and also may not
represent a group of people anymore.
It’s worth exploring how we got to this point to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Origins
Winnti was named as a group in a 2013 blog by Kaspersky. The blog’s authors named the
group based on a malware family previously named by Symantec. This very quickly brings
us to lesson one: it’s not advisable to name a group exclusively based on the malware family,
especially when the name was coined by another researcher.
Kaspersky’s research described intrusions going back to 2010, in which attackers targeted
video game companies or used digital code signing certificates stolen from game companies.

Kaspersky listed some other notable characteristics in the campaigns it analysed, including
unusual infrastructure DNS configurations, some relatively advanced rootkit malware,
specific C2 choices and the use of characteristic Chinese malware such as PlugX.
Kaspersky discovered activity that generated revenue via creation of in-game currency or
theft of source code, as well as targeting of specific ethnic groups that pointed to PRC
sponsorship. Kaspersky researchers also picked up on some terrible OPSEC that revealed
Chinese personas, further substantiated when some of the same handles showed up in a
2018 US Department of Justice indictment that pinned the theft of aerospace IP on the
Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security.
A year later FireEye published a report about how Chinese groups appeared to be sharing
malware development, digital code signing certificates, and infrastructure. The company
referenced some of the stolen digital certificates from Kaspersky’s prior research but didn’t at
this stage name Winnti as a group.
By mid-2015, Kaspersky linked Winnti malware to other research on the Axiom Group (which
may or may not be the same group). Axiom had been tied to a lot of intrusions, but most
critically, its fingerprints were identified in the CCleaner, Netsarang, and ASUS software
supply chain attacks. Kaspersky used similarities between malware used in these attacks
and those previously attributed to ‘Winnti’ to illustrate that the latter was targeting a broader
set of organisations than gaming companies. While these findings were important, attribution
based on malware similarity alone is risky, especially when there is an existing body of
research about malware being shared among different groups.
In 2016, Symantec published a blog about digital signing certificate abuse that is pertinent to
the Winnti story. It referenced Kaspersky’s earlier findings but didn’t name it, describing it
only as “a third party vendor”. Here’s another lesson: in any other field of research you would
credit primary sources, even if you don’t especially like them. It puts recognition where it’s
due, fosters collaboration and reduces the risk of “semantic drift” – where over time the
definition of something loses connection to its original meaning.
To their credit, Symantec researchers tried to correct the course a little on their previous work
- using the blog post to differentiate a group it referred to as Blackfly from the malware family
Winnti. Unfortunately, Symantec’s more cautious approach to naming conventions never
caught on elsewhere.
Not content to let a chance pass by to participate in the Winnti goat rodeo, Cylance posted a
blog in 2016 about PassCV activity (“PassCV” is a name coined by Blue Coat) and linked
this activity to Winnti based on stolen code signing certificates. The post is light on malware
analysis but mentions the use of several remote access trojans, ZXShell and Gh0st, in
passing. Gh0st RAT has been used by multiple Chinese and North Korean groups. ZXShell

was a RAT commonly associated with Group72, which on the one hand also seems to
correspond to Axiom/Winnti activity, but on the other, appears tied to APT27/Emissary
Panda.
With the benefit of time on its side, Microsoft came up with the most sane approach,
breaking down the groups using Winnti malware into BARIUM and LEAD. BARIUM targets
“electronic gaming, multimedia, and internet content industries” as well as the occasional
tech company, while LEAD is responsible for industrial espionage against manufacturing,
pharmaceutical, engineering companies and academia. The tradecraft of the two groups
could be distinguished at this point: BARIUM would attempt to establish rapport via social
media and made use of malicious office macros, compiled HTML (.chm) files or shortcut
(.lnk) files as first stages, while LEAD tended to just email the Winnti install package to
victims or brute force credentials on a server and copy down the Winnti malware.
But in an April 2017 blog, Trend Micro bound the activity together again, describing “Winnti”
as a criminal group that made fake antivirus engines in 2007 and shifted focus to hacking
video game companies in 2009. Trend made these conclusions based on domain name
registrations. This is another dangerous assumption.
ProtectWise’ 401 Threat Research Group posted a couple of blogs about the “Winnti group”a
few months later in July 2017, revealing the group’s use of open source tools including
Metasploit, BeEF, and Cobalt Strike. Both blogs were later updated to make clear that they
were talking specifically about the LEAD group labeled by Microsoft. The 401TRG reports
included some side-eye inducing conclusions. First, they included high confidence attribution
to China. “High confidence” is usually reserved for governments that watch events happen
over hacked closed circuit TVs - whereas these reports predated any indictments. Second,
the researchers didn’t provide a full explanation of how they were able to attribute activity to
Winnti other than via stolen signing certificates. They did, on the positive side, show
evidence of research - including a blog that summarises the public research various parties
had done on the group so far.
In 2019, ESET attributed a software supply chain attack via Thai video games and a gaming
platform to a group called “Winnti”, as well as compromises of universities in Hong Kong. In a
2019 summary of all of this activity, ESET concluded that Axiom Group and “Winnti” are
synonymous.
That same year – five years after its blog about supply chain overlap between Chinese
groups – FireEye designated APT41 to be a China-based actor group responsible for a
subset of “Winnti” activity. APT41 was described as a “dual espionage and cyber crime
operation”, conducting everything from espionage, targeting of activists, financially-motivated
activity, and both the ASUS and Netsarang supply chain attacks. FireEye leaned on analysis
of the operatives’ working hours to speculate that it was a group of state-sponsored
contractors that also do side-gigs to make more money. FireEye bundled in to that
designation previous activity it identified under the name GREF and the use of stolen digital
3/5

signing certificates, and mentioned that APT41 shared malware with seven other suspected
Chinese groups, including China Chopper and Sogu. It didn’t link it to APT27/Emissary
Panda activity.
In 2020, Cylance, now owned by Blackberry, updated the public on its view – describing
activity that used a Linux rootkit and shared links to Android malware.This time around the
Cylance analysis put more effort into differentiating activity based on targeting, while
acknowledging the malware was being shared between various groups.
This year, FireEye also published a blog concluding that APT41 went after many different
kinds of victims using Citrix, Cisco and Zoho ManageEngine vulnerabilities. It again
mentioned the use of open source tools and living off the land techniques such as
Metasploit, BITSjobs, and Cobalt Strike.
We continue to see the name ‘Winnti’ routinely mentioned in numerous news reports. But
what even is Winnti at this point?

What have we learned from “Winnti”?
The name ‘Winnti’ has been diluted to the point where it’s no longer useful. I understand the
benefits of using threat intelligence reporting as a form of marketing, but it’s still research,
and should be treated accordingly.
When relating activity to an existing group, talk to the originator about their understanding to
avoid hijacking the name.
When your cluster diverges from the originator’s, use your own group name and explain how
and why it diverges. Great reports often express confidence levels, talk about why links are
significant, and show how different data can lead to different analysis. Using your own group
name can also help keep other researchers from dumping their analysis, good or bad, into
your activity bucket without you having a say in the matter. We should prioritise the quality of
our research over the clicks and hype from using a recognisable group name.
Don’t be afraid to make updates to published research or retract them under extreme
circumstances. It’s better to have integrity and temporary embarrassment than have your
organisation’s name be associated with bad attribution for eternity.
I’ve made all the mistakes. And I’ve learned from them. Admitting to and learning from
mistakes is part of the journey to good analysis. Sometimes good research requires asking
other researchers for explanations or collaborating.
Researchers should lean on better-defined actor names like LEAD and BARIUM or stick to
names of their own devising to avoid creating more confusion. And in case I’ve left any room
for doubt about what we should do with the name ‘Winnti’, here’s my suggestion.
