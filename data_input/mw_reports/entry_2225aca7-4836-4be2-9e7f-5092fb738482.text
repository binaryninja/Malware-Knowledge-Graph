Infection chain
• Attackers
• build ELF malware using a

customized builder
• start HTTP File Server (HFS) to
host the previously built

malicious binaries
• run port scanners on IP ranges
• Some of the distributed Windows

binaries infected by file infectors
(Parite, Sality, Virut)

Infection chain
• If a port of interest is opened:
• script exploiting vulnerabilities
• Elasticsearch RCE: CVE-2014-3120
• Shellshock
• Apache Struts & Apache Tomcat
• MS08-067 – Vulnerability in Server Service
• Targets windows machines
• Privilege escalation: CVE-2009-2692, CVE-2010-3081, CVE-2013-2094
• SSH brute force attack
• Lists of user names and passwords
• Runs from windows machine, targets Linux servers

Infection chain
• Usage of several hacking tools
• Port scanners
• ScanPort

• WinEggDrop

Infection chain
• Login/password bruteforcers
• SSH2.1

• DUBrute

Infection chain
• Lists of target IP ranges

• Password lists
• All tools and lists acquired from the HFS file listings on a compromised

machine

Infection chain
• Result of a port scan (wineggdrop) as found in an archive on a compromised

machine
• About 2M IPs scanned and 14K hosts with open port 22 found

Binaries, common characteristics
• Trojanized flooding tools
• Significant portion of code seems to be shared among all the variants
• Chinese locale
• Some variants written in C++ (objects; classes)
• Debug info often not stripped
• Variety of supported flooding methods
• UDP, TCP/SYN, ICMP, DNS, DNS amplification
• Various communication protocols
• Kill competing resource consuming processes

Binaries, obfuscation techniques
• Binaries in plain form or packed with (modified) UPX
• UPX header modifications to avoid unpacking by the original UPX tool
• UPX magic modifications
• UPX magic should be found three times in ELF UPX binary
• All three magic values are the same, but different from “UPX!”
• All three magic values are different
• Checksums do not match
• (ELF:MrBlack; DDoS64; 18442c18d407ba32fdfa2bbf0c86565f)
• Header checksum (custom, 1 byte)
• compressed data (Adler, 4 bytes)
• uncompressed data (Adler, 4 bytes)

Binaries, obfuscation techniques
• Architecture mismatch
• (ELF:IptabLesx; .SSHH2; 6feb4677db052e9c7e19de52e3503db7)
• File with a 32-bit UPX header attempts to call 64-bit unpacking method
• Causes reading from wrong offsets
• Expected data size modification
• Pack Header contains incorrect field “uncompressed size”
• Original UPX tool exits with an error
• cannot unpack such modified binaries (very sensitive to PackHeader data)
• Dynamic behavior not altered

Binaries, obfuscation techniques
• UPX Header Checksum (0xDD  0x39)
• Decompressing method change:
• UPX_F_LINUX_ELF64_AMD (0x16)

•  UPX_F_BSD_ELF_i386 (0x19)
• Unpacked file size
• 0xB869F  0x8760B

• Header Offset
• 0xBC  0x80
• Compressed data checksum

• 0xBA260B3A  0xF65887DC

Statistics
• Number of victims is lower than in case

of other Windows threats
• HTTP servers running on compromised
machines show thousands of

downloads, but considering selfupdates the number could be lower
• Download count of ”Bill Gates”

installer is highlighted

Statistics
• Downloads from HFS server on a different machine, showing tens of
thousands downloads

Statistics – Preferences of File Names

Victim preferences
• Attacked small or medium sized local businesses
• profitability depends of ability to stay online
• Victims:
• Online gaming site/casinos
• E-commerce shops
• Forums
• Potential methods of monetization:
• DDoS as a service
• paying ransom for stopping the DDoS attack
• Effect of DDoS directly observed:
• sites unreachable during the process of receiving attack commands
• reachability recovered after the process stopped

Victim preferences
• Online gaming

Victim preferences
• Online casinos

Victim preferences
• E-shops

Victim preferences
• Forums

Conclusion
• Chinese flooding tools continue in tradition of DDoS attacks
• Lots of variants with similar flooding methods under multiple platforms
• The complexity of Linux Trojans has increased
• Attacks significantly more frequent in the past year
• Tool development supported by code sharing through Chinese forums for
developers
• Targeting online services for which online availability is crucial
• (intentional) AV evasion technique with (customized) UPX packer
• Right time to include a static unpacker for ELF UPX into AV engines?
