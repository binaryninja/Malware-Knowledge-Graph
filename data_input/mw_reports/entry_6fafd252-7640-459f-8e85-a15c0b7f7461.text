Introduction
In September 2021, SOVA, a new Android Banking Trojan, was announced in a known
underground forum. Even though at that time the author claimed the malware was still under
development, it actually already had multiple capabilities and was basically almost in the goto market phase.
Furthermore, the authors of SOVA showed a roadmap with the future update of the malware
as shown in Figure 1.

Until March 2022, multiple versions of SOVA were found and some of these features were
already implemented, such as: 2FA interception, cookie stealing and injections for new
targets and countries (e.g. multiple Philippine banks).
In July 2022, we discovered a new version of SOVA (v4) which presents new capabilities and
seems to be targeting more than 200 mobile applications, including banking apps and crypto
exchanges/wallets.

Updates - SOVA v4
Starting from May 2022, Threat Actors (TAs) behind SOVA have started to deliver a new
version of their malware, hiding within fake Android applications that show up with the logo of
a few famous ones, like Chrome, Amazon, NFT platform or others.

Differently from the previous versions, this time several new codes were added. The most
interesting part is related to the VNC capability. As shown in Figure 1, this feature has been
in the SOVA roadmap since September 2021 and that is one strong evidence that TAs are
constantly updating the malware with new features and capabilities.
Starting from SOVA v4, TAs can obtain screenshots of the infected devices, to retrieve more
information from the victims. Furthermore, the malware is also able to record and obtain any
sensitive information, as shown in Figure 5. These features, combined with Accessibility
services, enable TAs to perform gestures and, consequently, fraudulent activities from the
infected device, as we have already seen in other Android Banking Trojans (e.g. Oscorp or
BRATA).
With SOVA v4, TAs are able to manage multiple commands, such as: screen click, swipe,
copy/paste and the capability to show an overlay screen to hide the screen to the victim.
However, it was observed that multiple logs information are still sent back to the C2. This
behavior is a strong indicator that SOVA is still going through a development process, while
TAs are rolling out new features and capabilities.

Moreover, in SOVA v4, the cookie stealer mechanism was refactored and improved. In
particular, TAs specified a comprehensive list of Google services that they are interested to
steal (e.g. Gmail, GPay, and Google Password Manager), plus a list of other applications.

For each of the stolen cookies, SOVA will also collect additional information such as “is
httpOnly”, its expiration date, etc.

Another interesting update about SOVA v4 is the refactoring of its “protections” module,
which aims to protect itself from different victim’s actions. For example, if the user tries to
uninstall the malware from the settings or pressing the icon, SOVA is able to intercept these
actions and prevent them (through the abuse of the Accessibilities) by returning to the home
screen and showing a toast (small popup) displaying “This app is secured”.

A peculiarity of SOVA v4 is the “core” relocation of the malware. Like the main Android
banking trojan, SOVA uses the .apk just to unpack a .dex file which contains the real
malicious functionalities of the malware. In the previous version, SOVA stored the .dex file
inside the directory of the app, while in the current version it uses a device's shared storage
directory (“Android/obb/”) to store it.
Lastly, in SOVA v4, an entire new module was dedicated to Binance exchange and the
Trust Wallet (official crypto wallet of Binance). For both applications, TAs aim to obtain
different information, like the balance of the account, different actions performed by the victim
inside the app and, finally, even the seed phrase (a collection of words) used to access the
crypto wallet.

C2 communications and panel
The communications between SOVA v4 and the C2 didn’t change compared to the previous
version (v3), except for the new command (vncinfo) used for its new VNC feature.
Meanwhile, also the C2 panel of SOVA was updated compared to the first version published
by the author in September 2021, with some new features and a complete UI restyle (as
shown in Figure 8).

New Targets
The first version of SOVA had almost 90 targeted applications (including banks, crypto
wallet/exchange, and generic shopping apps), initially listed and stored in the packageList.txt
file within the assets/ folder. In the latest samples, this file has been removed and the
targeted applications are managed through the communications between the malware and
the C2.
The number of targeted applications has grown faster, compared to the initial phases of
SOVA: during March 2022 multiple Philippine banks have been added and then during May
2022, another list of banking applications has been added too, as shown in the following
Figure 10.

Figure 10 – Comparison between SOVA targets, from September 2021 to July 2022
To obtain the list of targeted applications, SOVA sends the list of all applications installed on
the device to the C2, right after it has been installed. At this point, the C2 sends back to the
malware the list of addresses for each targeted application and stores this information inside
an XML file.

Another interesting fact is that, in some of the analyzed samples of SOVA v4, the list of CIS
region used in the previous versions (used to exclude these countries from attacks) was
removed and, at the time of writing, all the initial Russian and Ukraine targeted apps were
removed.

Further updates - SOVA v5
During the reviewing of the document on SOVA v4, we spotted on our threat intelligence
platform (Cleafy ASK) multiple samples that seem to belong to a further variant of SOVA
(v5); we want to provide you with an overview of this variant too.
Analyzing the code of the malware, it is possible to observe a big refactoring of the code, the
addition of new features and some small changes in the communications between the
malware and the C2 server. Furthermore, the samples of SOVA v5 that we analyzed don’t
present the VNC module that we observed in SOVA v4: our hypothesis is that it was simply
not integrated in the v5version yet. In fact, the malware seems to be still under development,
due to the presence of multiple logs used for debugging.

Although there are several changes, the most interesting features added in SOVA v5 is the
ransomware module, that was announced in the roadmap of September 2021.

10/12

However, even though this feature has been already implemented in the current version (v5),
at the time of writing it seems to be still under development.
The aim of TAs is to encrypt the files inside the infected devices through an AES algorithm
and renaming them with the extension “.enc”.
The ransomware feature is quite interesting as it’s still not a common one in the Android
banking trojans landscape. It strongly leverages on the opportunity arises in recent years, as
mobile devices became for most people the central storage for personal and business data.

Conclusions
With the discovery of SOVA v4 and SOVA v5, we uncovered new evidence about how TAs
are constantly improving their malware and the C2 panel, honouring the published roadmap.
Although the malware is still under development, it’s ready to carry on fraudulent activities at
scale.
