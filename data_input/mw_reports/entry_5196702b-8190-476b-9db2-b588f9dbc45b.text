Together with our colleagues at IssueMakersLab, we uncovered Operation Red Signature,
an information theft-driven supply chain attack targeting organizations in South Korea. We
discovered the attacks around the end of July, while the media reported the attack in South
Korea on August 6.
The threat actors compromised the update server of a remote support solutions provider to
deliver a remote access tool called 9002 RAT to their targets of interest through the update
process. They carried this out by first stealing the company’s certificate then using it to sign
the malware. They also configured the update server to only deliver malicious files if the
client is located in the range of IP addresses of their target organizations.
9002 RAT also installed additional malicious tools: an exploit tool for Internet Information
Services (IIS) 6 WebDav (exploiting CVE-2017-7269) and an SQL database password
dumper. These tools hint at how the attackers are also after data stored in their target’s web
server and database.

Here’s how Operation Red Signature works:
1/6

1. The code-signing certificate from the remote support solutions provider is stolen. It’s
possible that the certificate was stolen as early as April 2018, as we found a ShiftDoor
malware (4ae4aed210f2b4f75bdb855f6a5c11e625d56de2) on April 8 that was signed
with the stolen certificate.
2. Malicious update files are prepared, signed with the stolen certificate, and uploaded to
the attacker’s server (207[.]148[.]94[.]157).
3. The update server of the company is hacked.
4. The update server is configured to receive an update.zip file from the attackers’ server
if a client is connecting from a specific range of IP addresses belonging to their
targeted organizations.
5. The malicious update.zip file is sent to the client when the remote support program is
executed.
6. The remote support program recognizes the update files as normal and executes the
9002 RAT malware inside it.
7. 9002 RAT downloads and executes additional malicious files from the attackers’ server.
Technical analysis
The update.zip file contains an update.ini file, which has the malicious update configuration
that specifies the remote support solution program to download file000.zip and file001.zip
and extract them as rcview40u.dll and rcview.log to the installation folder.
The program will then execute rcview40u.dll, signed with the stolen certificate, with Microsoft
register server (regsvr32.exe). This dynamic-link library (DLL) is responsible for decrypting
the encrypted rcview.log file and executing it in memory. 9002 RAT is the decrypted
rcview.log payload, which connects to the command-and-control (C&C) server at
66[.]42[.]37[.]101.

Correlating 9002 RAT
Delving into 9002 RAT, we found that it was compiled on July 17, 2018, and that the
configuration files inside update.zip were created on July 18. Our analysis of an update log
file we found reveals the remote support program’s update process started around 13:35 on
2/6

July 18, with the 9002 RAT being downloaded and launched. We also saw the RAT file used
for this specific attack was set to be inactive in August, so we can construe that the RAT’s
activity was rather short-lived (from July 18 to July 31).

configuration (center), and snapshot of the program’s update log (bottom)

Additional malware tools
The 9002 RAT also serves as a springboard for delivering additional malware. Most of these
are downloaded as files compressed with the Microsoft cabinet format (.cab). This is most
likely done to avoid detection by antivirus (AV) solutions.
Here’s a list of files that 9002 RAT retrieves and delivers to the affected system:

Mitigating supply chain attacks
Supply chain attacks don’t just affect users and businesses — they exploit the trust between
vendors and its clients or customers. By trojanizing software/applications or manipulating the
infrastructures or platforms that run them, supply chain attacks affects the integrity and
security of the goods and services that organizations provide. In healthcare, for instance,
where the industry heavily relies on third-party and cloud-based services, supply chain
attacks can risk the privacy of personally identifiable data and intellectual property, disrupt
hospital operations, and even endanger patient health. And when stacked up with
regulations such as the EU General Data Protection and Regulation (GDPR), the impact can
be exacerbated.
Here are some best practices:
Oversee third-party products and services; apart from ensuring the security of the
organization’s own online premises (e.g., patching, authentication mechanisms),
security controls must also be in place in third-party applications being used.
Develop a proactive incident response strategy: Supply chain attacks are often
targeted; organizations must be able to fully understand, manage, and monitor the risks
involved in third-party vendors.
Proactively monitor the network for anomalous activities; firewalls and intrusion
detection and prevention systems help mitigate network-based threats.
Enforce the principle of least privilege: Network segmentation, data categorization,
restriction of system administration tools, and application control help deter lateral
movement and minimize data being exposed.
