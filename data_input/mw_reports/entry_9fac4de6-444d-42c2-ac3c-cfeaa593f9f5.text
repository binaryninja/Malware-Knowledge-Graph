U.S. elections

October 12, 2020

Today we took action to disrupt a botnet called Trickbot, one of the world’s most infamous
botnets and prolific distributors of ransomware.
As the United States government and independent experts have warned, ransomware is one
of the largest threats to the upcoming elections. Adversaries can use ransomware to infect a
computer system used to maintain voter rolls or report on election-night results, seizing those
systems at a prescribed hour optimized to sow chaos and distrust.
We disrupted Trickbot through a court order we obtained as well as technical action we
executed in partnership with telecommunications providers around the world. We have now
cut off key infrastructure so those operating Trickbot will no longer be able to initiate new
infections or activate ransomware already dropped into computer systems.

In addition to protecting election infrastructure from ransomware attacks, today’s action will
protect a wide range of organizations including financial services institutions, government
agencies, healthcare facilities, businesses and universities from the various malware
infections Trickbot enabled.
The Trickbot botnet
Trickbot has infected over a million computing devices around the world since late 2016.
While the exact identity of the operators is unknown, research suggests they serve both
nation-states and criminal networks for a variety of objectives.
In the course of Microsoft’s investigation into Trickbot, we analyzed approximately 61,000
samples of Trickbot malware. What makes it so dangerous is that it has modular capabilities
that constantly evolve, infecting victims for the operators’ purposes through a “malware-as-aservice” model. Its operators could provide their customers access to infected machines and
offer them a delivery mechanism for many forms of malware, including ransomware. Beyond
infecting end user computers, Trickbot has also infected a number of “Internet of Things”
devices, such as routers, which has extended Trickbot’s reach into households and
organizations.
In addition to maintaining modular capabilities for a variety of end purposes, the operators
have proven adept at changing techniques based on developments in society. Trickbot’s
spam and spear phishing campaigns used to distribute malware have included topics such
as Black Lives Matter and COVID-19, enticing people to click on malicious documents or
links. Based on the data we see through Microsoft Office 365 Advanced Threat Detection,
Trickbot has been the most prolific malware operation using COVID-19 themed lures.
Disruption components and new legal strategy
We took today’s action after the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia granted our request for a court order to halt Trickbot’s operations.
During the investigation that underpinned our case, we were able to identify operational
details including the infrastructure Trickbot used to communicate with and control victim
computers, the way infected computers talk with each other, and Trickbot’s mechanisms to
evade detection and attempts to disrupt its operation. As we observed the infected
computers connect to and receive instructions from command and control servers, we were
able to identify the precise IP addresses of those servers. With this evidence, the court
granted approval for Microsoft and our partners to disable the IP addresses, render the
content stored on the command and control servers inaccessible, suspend all services to the
botnet operators, and block any effort by the Trickbot operators to purchase or lease
additional servers.

To execute this action, Microsoft formed an international group of industry and
telecommunications providers. Our Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) led investigation efforts
including detection, analysis, telemetry, and reverse engineering, with additional data and
insights to strengthen our legal case from a global network of partners including FSISAC, ESET, Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs, NTT and Symantec, a division of Broadcom, in
addition to our Microsoft Defender team. Further action to remediate victims will be
supported by internet service providers (ISPs) and computer emergency readiness teams
(CERTs) around the world.
This action also represents a new legal approach that our DCU is using for the first time. Our
case includes copyright claims against Trickbot’s malicious use of our software code. This
approach is an important development in our efforts to stop the spread of malware, allowing
us to take civil action to protect customers in the large number of countries around the world
that have these laws in place.
We fully anticipate Trickbot’s operators will make efforts to revive their operations, and we
will work with our partners to monitor their activities and take additional legal and technical
steps to stop them.
Impact to additional sectors
In addition to its threat to elections, Trickbot is known for using malware to reach online
banking websites and steal funds from people and financial institutions. Financial institutions
ranging from global banks and payments processors to regional credit unions have been
targeted by Trickbot. For this reason, the Financial Services Information Sharing and
Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) has been a critical partner and a co-plaintiff in our legal action.
When someone using a Trickbot-infected computer attempts to log onto a financial
institutions website, Trickbot executes a series of activities to secretly hijack the user’s web
browser, capture the person’s online financial login credentials and other personal
information, and send that information to the criminal operators. People are unaware of
Trickbot’s activity as the operators have designed it to hide itself. After Trickbot captures
login credentials and personal information, operators use that information to access people’s
bank accounts. People experience a normal login process and are typically unaware of the
underlying surveillance and theft.
Trickbot is also known to deliver the Ryuk crypto-ransomware that has been used in attacks
against a wide range of public and private institutions. Ransomware can have devastating
effects. Most recently, it crippled the IT network of a German hospital resulting in the death of
a woman seeking emergency treatment. Ryuk is a sophisticated crypto-ransomware
because it identifies and encrypts network files and disables Windows System Restore to
prevent people from being able to recover from the attack without external backups. Ryuk
has been attacking organizations, including municipal governments, state courts, hospitals,
nursing homes, enterprises and large universities. For example, Ryuk has been attributed to
3/4

attacks targeting a contractor for the Department of Defense, the North Carolina city of
Durham, an IT provider for 110 nursing homes, and a number of hospitals during the COVID19 pandemic.
Election security and guarding against malware
As we shared last month in the Microsoft Digital Defense Report, ransomware is on the rise.
For organizations involved in the elections wanting protection from ransomware and other
threats, we offer the threat notification service AccountGuard at no cost which now protects
more than two million email accounts around the world. We’ve completed more than 1,500
AccountGuard nation-state attack notifications to AccountGuard enrollees to date. We also
offer Microsoft 365 for Campaigns, an easy-to-set-up version of Microsoft 365 that comes
with intelligent and secure default settings at an affordable price. Finally, Election Security
Advisors provide proactive resiliency services and reactive incident response for campaigns
and election officials, also at an affordable price.
Our Digital Crimes Unit will also continue to engage in operations to protect organizations
involved in the democratic process and our entire customer base. Since 2010, Microsoft,
through the Digital Crimes Unit, has collaborated with law enforcement and other partners on
23 malware and nation-state domain disruptions, resulting in over 500 million devices
rescued from cybercriminals. With this civil action, we have leveraged a new legal strategy
that allows us to enforce copyright law to prevent Microsoft infrastructure, in this case our
software code, from being used to commit crime. As copyright law is more common than
computer crime law, this new approach helps us pursue bad actors in more jurisdictions
around the world.
