Stash Seized

The DarkSide ransomware affiliate program responsible for the six-day outage at Colonial
Pipeline this week that led to fuel shortages and price spikes across the country is running
for the hills. The crime gang announced it was closing up shop after its servers were seized
and someone drained the cryptocurrency from an account the group uses to pay affiliates.
“Servers were seized (country not named), money of advertisers and founders was
transferred to an unknown account,” reads a message from a cybercrime forum reposted to
the Russian OSINT Telegram channel.

“A few hours ago, we lost access to the public part of our infrastructure,” the message
continues, explaining the outage affected its victim shaming blog where stolen data is
published from victims who refuse to pay a ransom.
“Hosting support, apart from information ‘at the request of law enforcement agencies,’ does
not provide any other information,” the DarkSide admin says. “Also, a few hours after the
withdrawal, funds from the payment server (ours and clients’) were withdrawn to an unknown
address.”
DarkSide organizers also said they were releasing decryption tools for all of the companies
that have been ransomed but which haven’t yet paid.
“After that, you will be free to communicate with them wherever you want in any way you
want,” the instructions read.

The DarkSide message includes passages apparently penned by a leader of the REvil
ransomware-as-a-service platform. This is interesting because security experts have posited
that many of DarkSide’s core members are closely tied to the REvil gang.
The REvil representative said its program was introducing new restrictions on the kinds of
organizations that affiliates could hold for ransom, and that henceforth it would be forbidden
to attack those in the “social sector” (defined as healthcare and educational institutions) and
organizations in the “gov-sector” (state) of any country. Affiliates also will be required to get
approval before infecting victims.
The new restrictions came as some Russian cybercrime forums began distancing
themselves from ransomware operations altogether. On Thursday, the administrator of the
popular Russian forum XSS announced the community would no longer allow discussion
threads about ransomware moneymaking programs.
“There’s too much publicity,” the XSS administrator explained. “Ransomware has gathered a
critical mass of nonsense, bullshit, hype, and fuss around it. The word ‘ransomware’ has
been put on a par with a number of unpleasant phenomena, such as geopolitical tensions,
extortion, and government-backed hacks. This word has become dangerous and toxic.”
In a blog post on the DarkSide closure, cyber intelligence firm Intel 471 said it believes all of
these actions can be tied directly to the reaction related to the high-profile ransomware
attacks covered by the media this week.
“However, a strong caveat should be applied to these developments: it’s likely that these
ransomware operators are trying to retreat from the spotlight more than suddenly discovering
the error of their ways,” Intel 471 wrote. “A number of the operators will most likely operate in
their own closed-knit groups, resurfacing under new names and updated ransomware
variants. Additionally, the operators will have to find a new way to ‘wash’ the cryptocurrency
they earn from ransoms. Intel 471 has observed that BitMix, a popular cryptocurrency mixing
service used by Avaddon, DarkSide and REvil has allegedly ceased operations. Several
apparent customers of the service reported they were unable to access BitMix in the last
week.”
