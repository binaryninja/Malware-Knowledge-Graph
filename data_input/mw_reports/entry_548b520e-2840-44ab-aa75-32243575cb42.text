"Wicked Rose" and the NCPH Hacking Group
by Ken Dunham & Jim Melnick
Zero-day attacks, where an attack occurs before public knowledge of a vulnerability is known, is
a growing cause of concern for security professionals in the 21st century. An unprecedented
number of zero-day attacks took place in 2006, largely involving Microsoft Office Files. Ken
Dunham, Director of the Rapid Response Team, and Jim Melnick, Director of Threat Operations,
led the VeriSign iDefense intelligence team to track down Chinese hackers for hire out of China,
responsible for many of the attacks in 2006. Wicked Rose is the ring-leader of the NCPH
hacking group and this is the story of their maturation into significant global threat by 2006.

Introduction to N.C.P.H.

N.C.P.H. (Network Crack Program Hacker) has about ten members or associates. Four core
members exist as of 2006:





(Wicked) Rose
KuNgBiM
Rodag
Charles

There are also some six other associates within NCPH and two other positions (possibly unfilled
positions) whose purpose is unclear. However, “Rose” or “Wicked Rose” seems to be the
primary leader. Membership rules, recruiting goals and standards are unknown. However, some
members appear to be current or former students of Sichuan University of Science and
Engineering.1
The group is responsible for development and deployment of exploit codes related vulnerabilities
in Microsoft Word Malformed OLE Structure Code Execution and Microsoft Excel Malformed
BIFF Structure Code Execution.

Public Knowledge of a Zero-Day Word Exploit

The story of NCPH zero-day attacks begins publicly on May 18, 2006. On this day the Internet
Storm Center reports a new possible zero-day attack. iDefense worked closely with SANS and
other organizations to analyze the threat landscape as it related to exploitation of this
vulnerability. Within the next 36 hours, iDefense gained access to multiple codes and extracted a
new rootkit called GinWui. Independent research proved the following:




Exploitation targeted a new vulnerability that allowed attackers to successfully exploit
computers running fully patched versions of Microsoft Word 2002 and others.
Exploitation dated to May 12, 2006 and involved at least six unique hostile exploit files.
iDefense confirmed that attacks targeted two organizations, one in the United States and
one in Japan.
Chinese-authored rootkits GinWui.A and GinWui.B exist in several attacks. iDefense
identified the rootkits' source and authors as Chinese actor "Wicked Rose" and others
profiled later in this report.

Successful installation of the rootkit requires Administrator or Debugger rights. Initial
exploitation, however, does not require Administrator rights.
iDefense identified unique malicious code attacks pointing to nease.net and authored
several Snort signatures for this traffic. iDefense continues to monitor other domains
related to the attack.

The original attack upon a large DoD entity within the USA began on May 12, 2006. Targets of
the attacker were apparently "Googled" by the attacker. Three variations of a Microsoft Word
zero-day attack are involved in the attack. A few dozen attack files are first distributed to less
than a dozen targets to identify which version works within the organization.
Once attackers identify the vulnerable version of Microsoft Word used within the organization
close to 200 messages sent out to multiple targets within the organization within 24 hours. This
second wave of attack is distributed as "Planning document 5-16-2006.doc". This code is
improved beyond the first variant sent out earlier to identify the vulnerable version of Word
within the targeted network.
A third attack commences on May 17, 2006. During this period, the Internet Storm Center and
others get involved and the case becomes public. In the end, iDefense identified six unique
samples, of which three are more prevalent than other variants.

The GinWui Backdoor Rootkit Payload

Zero day attacks commenced in May 2006 attempted to install a GinWui backdoor Trojan horse
and Windows rootkit. A DLL file called winguis.dll and several SYS files install themselves
when a computer is successfully attacked through an exploit. Two versions of the GinWui
rootkit are installed during several attacks in May and June 2006.

NCHP 5.0 Screenshot (GinWui Rootkit)
Wicked Rose is the author of the GinWui malicious code. His code and support posts related to
GinWui distributions exist on the Chinese NCPH and Evil Octal forums. Wicked Rose
associates with WHG and others on this form. WHT hosted version "3.0beta.3" of the "NCPH

remote control" rootkit code on May 2, 2006. This distribution of GinWui was largely unknown
and undetected by anti-virus companies at the time of release.
Versions of GinWui used in targeted attacks of May and June 2006 are private versions, not
released to the public. This proves that Wicked Rose either constructed the zero day attacks or
sold private code to users that performed the attack.
Wicked Rose later documents additional updates to his rootkit code, version .50, at
http://rodag.blogbus.com/index.html. By this time Wicked Rose was performing full-time
development of this malicious code as a hacker for hire.

June 21, 2007 – Continued US Targeted Attacks

Just over a month later, following initial GinWui based targeted attacks, another Microsoft Word
exploit occurs on June 21, 2006. A spoofed e-mail is sent to a target containing a hostile
Microsoft Word document. Analysis of the attack reveals that it's likely a test file used to
identify what version of Word may be running within the targeted organization, rather than a
refined targeted attack upon a known version of Microsoft Word. Chinese text within the Word
document reveal Chinese characters discussing a systematic evaluation of offsets for Microsoft
Word exploitation:

RipGof attacks reveal a Chinese string related to systematic testing of offsets for exploitation.

Backtracking Targeted Attacks: RipGof

In June 2006 another targeted attack emerges, but it's not GinWui this time but a new code,
RipGof.B. The attack attempts to exploit MS06-027 to install RipGof.B, a Trojan horse. This is
the same exploit code used in the former Zero-Day attacks linked to Wicked Rose and the NCPH
hacking group. The exploit code is still private at this time, proving that the author of both
GinWui and RipGof attacks are the same individual or group or affiliated through underground
criminal operations.

RipGof.B is an improvement of the former exploit used in GinWui attacks. RipGof.B attacks
included improvements to shellcode that attempts to fork to different locations based upon the
address value of the stack to exploit multiple versions of Microsoft Word. Once installed,
RipGof.B attempts to connect to enjoy.irdet.com and enjoy.bmwsee.com over TCP port 80. It
runs as a rootkit and backdoor Trojan horse and phones home to a Chinese server with stolen
data.
RipGof malicious code does not exist as a distribution in the underground, leading investigators
to look into the original RipGof.A malicious code. Over a year prior to the 2006 targeted attacks
RipGof.A emerges in the wild. RipGof.A attempted to exploit the Jet Engine Database exploit in
March 2005. This proves attempted exploitation and installation of code through RipGof for a
year prior to more sophisticated codes and attacks.
In summary, RipGof and GinWui attacks both use the same private exploit code against
Microsoft Word and both install rootkit based codes to steal and send information back to
Chinese sources. This circumstantial evidence reveals that Wicked Rose and the NCPH group
likely began their exploitation efforts at least a year and a half to two years prior to sophisticated
attacks that commenced in 2006. Once the group found a vulnerability within Microsoft Word
they were able to improve upon it and their targeted attack techniques to distribute multiple
targeted attacks and malicious codes for criminal gain as hackers for hire.

Timeline of Events

Wicked Rose and the NCPH hacking group are implicated in multiple Office based attacks over
a two year period. An attack in 2006 used RipGof.B in the attack. RipGof.A first emerged a
year earlier using an exploit that is relatively unsophisticated. Over the next year the Evil
Security Team, also out of China, creates the Dasher worm and uses the PcShares Trojan in an
attack. Wicked Rose gives a recommendation on the Trojan the day it is updated in the spring of
2006, showing a close affiliation between Wicked Rose and the Evil Security Team actors.
Multiple attacks that take place in May and June and later 2006 are related to privately held
exploit code for both Microsoft Word and Excel, proven to be developed by Wicked Rose. A

A Pictorial Introduction to Wicked Rose and NCPH

Just who are Wicked Rose and the NCPH hacker group? As it turns out, a collection of college
students in China who likely room with one another and regularly support their hacking interests.
In-depth research implicates Wicked Rose as the ring-leader of the group, responsible for
managing hacker for hire relationships and paying group members for their work as hackers.
During the time of targeted attacks in 2006 their income increased significantly, to full-time
wages for part time hacking. Wicked Rose, leader of the group, is pictured below:

Wicked Rose's Website: www.mghacker.com
Rose is an approximate 20-year-old (2006) student at the Sichuan University of Science &
Engineering. In the spring of 2006 Wicked Rose claims to have dropped out of school for full
time hacking opportunities. Specifically, on April 30, 2006 his blog entry claims he did not
register for his university exam. He performed significant updates to his rootkit code from
March through June 2006. He later returned to school by September 2006.
Wicked Rose claims responsibility on his blog for targeted e-mail based attacks containing
Microsoft Word and CHM exploits from the spring of 2006.
Other NCPH-member websites include: http://rodag.blogbus.com,

Additional photos featuring Wicked Rose and NCPH hackers are below, captured from their
various websites and blog entries in 2006. Chinese translation for each photo are below:

"Wicked Rose"
From an ancient Chinese poem,
expressing the devotion of his heart for
hacking.

"After you choose the technology you
love, you have to research every system
and code everyday!"

Charles: "Silence belongs to our
world..."

Charles
"Charles always laughs so brightly when
searching for program problems!"

KuNgBiM
"Only we can feel this kind of happy..."
Ronag
"Behind every successful design, he
always has a slight smile…"

WHG is not a core member of NCPH but a close affiliate of Wicked Rose. WHG appears to be
central to development of the NCPH rootkit, aka GinWui. WHG is credited by Wicked Rose as
one of the authors of this malicious code. WHG is an experienced malicious code author with

WZT
WZT is a former member of the NCPH group who was kicked out during the time of zero-day
attacks in May 2006. WZT was removed on May 20, 2006. During this time period the zeroday attacks became publicly disclosed, increasing pressure upon the hacking group. It is feasible
that WZT may have offended the group in some way related to zero-day attack techniques, strife
over hacker for hire deals, or competition for hacker for hire deals.
WZT is a former coding expert within the NCPH group and many years experience in hacking.
He is responsible for creating multiple tools and regularly giving credit to the infamous Li0n
Chinese hacker (founder of Honker Union (HUC) Chinese group. WZT maintains a website at
tthacker.cublog.cn.
The Jiangsu Connection?

WHOIS registrant data for related domains used within attacks and hacker sites reveals a
connection with the Jiangsu province of China. One domain, windowsupdates.net, is used in
attacks and revolves to an IP address in the Sichuan province. Meanwhile, the registrant
"zhaofeng network" is reportedly based out of Jiangsu, not Sichuan. Some of the WHOIS
information clearly contains fraudulent information to presumably direct researchers away from
the true identity and location of the attacker responsible for registering the hostile domain. The
connection to the Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces remains unclear.

Concluding Comments

Prior to Wicked Rose and NCPH hacker for hire attacks in 2006, Chinese hackers are only
known for their patriotic hacking. This disturbing development reveals two critical threats: 1)
motives of Chinese hackers are changing 2) Chinese hackers are regularly associated with
sophisticated attacks as of 2006.
Wicked Rose implicates himself in his early blog entries and website posts in 2006 and prior.
An unknown company or entity reportedly paid Wicked Rose for hacking at the rate of 2,000
RMB a month, about $250 USD. At this time Wicked Rose gave 200 RMB to NCPH hackers
and kept the rest for himself. Once targeted attacks took place the payment increased five-fold to
5,000 RMB monthly with $1,000 a month going to NCPH hackers. This is a significant amount
of money in China, effectively paying hackers a full-time wage for part-time hacking.

Throughout the summer of 2006, while Wicked Rose was not in school, over 35 zero-day
attacks, proof-of-concept codes, and attacks against un-patched Microsoft Office vulnerabilities
are discovered in the wild. With Wicked Rose claiming responsibility for early attacks and the
lead author of both GinWui and the NCPH hacking group, there is little doubt left as to his
involvement in attacks to date.
By the end of 2006 attacks become increasingly sophisticated. In one instance a popular
PowerPoint file distributed during the Christmas holiday season for the last two years prior is
used within a socially engineered attack upon one individual within an energy sector US based
company. The PowerPoint file is modified to include an exploit that silently installs malicious
code. This same individual receives another e-mail containing a Microsoft Word exploit. In this
case only one individual within the company is targeted, and with just two messages socially
engineered for maximum success. This is a much more targeted and stealthy approach for
attacks compared to the earlier attacks performed by the group in the late spring of 2006.
NCPH continues to be a significant threat going forth for several reasons.
1. Attacks continue to take place in the wild and are very difficult to identify on a targeted
basis. Only the most sophisticated networks and system administrators are able to
properly protect and capture hostile targeted attack files before an attack takes place.
2. NCPH is a serious dedicated hacking group that is methodical and disciplined in their
development of new exploits and attacks.
3. NCPH is motivated by both the thrill and challenge of hacking and money as a motive.
4. Attacks by the group are highly targeted and stealthy, very difficult to detect and remove.
