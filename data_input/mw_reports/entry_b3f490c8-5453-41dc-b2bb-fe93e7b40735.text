CONTROL SYSTEMS
(2) Cybersecurity Hygiene Checklist (Contractor Version)

1.
Purpose. This ITG provides the basic criteria guidance concerning
the implementation of Cybersecurity to Facility-Related Control
Systems for projects currently under design and construction.
2.
Background. A control system (CS) typically consists of network
capable digital controllers and user interfaces that are used to
monitor and possibly control equipment. There are many types of
control systems ranging from building control systems to manufacturing
control systems to weapon control systems, all with different names
and terminology.
Facility-related control systems are a subset of
control systems that are used to monitor and control equipment and
systems, such as building control systems, utility control systems,
electronic security systems, and fire and life safety systems. Per
the requirements of References (a) and (b), facility control systems
must be cybersecured.

a.
CNIC and NAVFAC issued reference (c) to inventory, assess,
interim secure, secure, and continuously monitor all facility
control systems on Navy installations in their respective
regions.
b. This effort will be conducted largely by the Echelon IV
NAVFAC Public Works (PW) and the Command Information Office
( CIO) .

3.

Discussion.
a.
For projects currently under design and construction, ITG
2017-01, through UFGS 25 50 00.00 20,incorporates elements of the
NAVFAC Cybersecurity Hygiene Checklist into contract
specifications for control systems. These elements will
facilitate achieving an Interim Secure cybersecurity level and
lessens the effort for PW/CIO when these facilities are accepted
into the CNIC inventory. The elements of the Cybersecurity
Hygiene Checklist do not require extensive design or construction
effort.
b. Reference (d), UFC 4-010-06, CYBERSECURITY OF FACILITYRELATED CONTROL SYSTEMS was issued 19 September 2016 and is
available on the Whole Building Design Guide website
(www.wbdg.org). The Tri-Service Unified Facility Guide
Specification (UFGS) containing detailed cybersecurity
requirements is not scheduled for release until early FY18
(November 2017).

4. Technical Guidance.
ITG 2017-01, including UFGS 25 50 00.00 20,
will remain in effect until the Tri-Service cybersecurity UFGS is
posted on the Whole Building Design Guide in early FY18.
5.

Action.
a.
This ITG applies to all design and construction, renovation,
and repair of new and existing facilities currently under design
and construction that result in DoN real property assets,
regardless of funding source.
Enclosure (1) contains UFGS 25 50
00.00 20, which requires the construction contractor to complete
the Cybersecurity Hygiene Checklist.
Coordinate requirements
with other project specifications having facility-related control
systems as required by enclosure (1) .
b.
Incorporate the requirements of UFGS 25 50 00.00 20 for all
FY17 and earlier Navy MILCON (e.g., MCON, ECIP, and UMC) projects
where project execution is
i.

In Design:
1. Beyond 35% design and without Design Release
2. Between Design Release and Contract Award
(evaluate the impacts of a pre-award amendment
versus a post-award modification)

ii.

In Construction:

Page 2 of 4

1. Prior to DBB Pre-Construction Meeting/DB Final
Design Acceptance (post award modification)
2. Between DBB Pre-Construction Meeting/DB Post-Award
Kick-off Meeting and RedZone meeting only if there
are not significant project impacts to schedule
and cost (post-award modification)
c.
Incorporate the requirements of UFGS 25 50 00.00 20 for all
non-MILCON Navy (e.g . , O&M,N) projects where project execution
is:
i.

Beyond 35% design and without Design Release

ii.

Between Design Release and DBB Pre-Construction
Meeting/DB Post Award Kickoff Meeting (evaluate the
impacts of a pre-award amendment versus a post-award
modification)

iii.

Between DBB Pre-Construction Meeting/DB Post-Award
Kick-off Meeting and RedZone meeting only if there are
not significant project impacts to schedule and cost
(post-award modification)

6.
Coordination.
This ITG has been coordinated with NAVFAC
Mechanical, Electrical, and Fire Protection Engineering (CI4)
communities of practice.
ITGs are published by the NAVFAC Engineering
Criteria and Programs Office (Cil) as part of the NAVFAC Criteria
Program and are available in PDF and Specsintact format on the WBDG at
https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/navy-navfac/interim-technical-guidance-itg.

representation. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to witness all
system verifications for cybersecurity.
3.1.1.1

Cybersecurity Field Verification Request

Perform the cybersecurity field verification for applicable equipment and
systems specified in the sections listed in paragraph FACILITY-RELATED
CONTROL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. The Contracting Officer must be notified at
least 15 days in advance of when the cybersecurity inspection will be done.
Every item on the checklist for applicable equipment and systems specified
is required to be examined for successful field verification.
