campaign, but the evidence that we will discuss in this blog post suggests that it is highly likely
that this individual has some involvement with the threat group.
This blog post highlights the trail of evidence individuals leave on the Internet when they are not
careful about disguising their identity. All of the information collected about this actor is public
and accessible through open source research.

The ProjectM actors rely on both spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites to deliver a
variety of different tools to target the Indian government and military. ProjectM actors used a
blog with a theme related to the Indian military titled “India News Tribe” (intribune.blogspot.com)
as a watering hole to deliver their payloads. This group also used spear-phishing emails with
malicious RTF files exploiting CVE-2010-3333 or CVE-2012-0158, in addition to Excel files that
contained malicious macros to download and install their payloads as well.

including custom developed tools called Crimson and Peppy, along with off-the-shelf remote
administration tools (RATs) and downloaders, such as DarkComet and Bozok. Another
interesting part of this campaign is the use of techniques and Trojans often seen in cybercrime
attacks, such as the use of the Andromeda Trojan as an initial payload in their attacks to
download and execute other tools in their toolset. The Operation Transparent Tribe report by
Darien Huss of Proofpoint provides an excellent analysis of the various tools used by this group,
including Crimson and Peppy and their associated infrastructure.

During our research, we analyzed the registration information of the Andromeda, Crimson and
Peppy Trojan command and control domains used by ProjectM. A majority of the infrastructure
associated with ProjectM was registered using WHOIS protection services, which conceals the
actual registrant’s information (name, email, etc.) used to register the domain name. However,

we discovered that the actors had in all likelihood, inadvertently neglected to use WHOIS
protection on two domains in their infrastructure that they used to host C2 servers for the
Andromeda Trojan.
The two undisguised domains were “winupdater[.]info” and “ordering-checks[.]com”, which were
registered using the email address “mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com”, as seen in Figure 1. The

information used to register these domains appears to be real and associated with the actor,
which differs from most infrastructure used in targeted attacks that use fake information and a
disposable email account during registration. On August 5, 2014, the actor seemingly discovered
his mistake as the “ordering-checks[.]com” domain was updated with WHOIS protection.

Figure 1 WHOIS Information for Two Command and Control Domains without Whois Protection

The Gmail address seen in Figure 1 is directly linked to Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, and
Skype accounts. All of the accounts have corroborative biographical content, giving us a
possible identity of a potential actor, who appears to be a 26-year-old individual from Karachi,
Pakistan. At this time, we cannot absolutely confirm this individual’s involvement with ProjectM,
Operation Transparent Tribe or Operation C-Major campaigns; however, strong evidence was
discovered linking this individual’s online presence to entities related to the threat group, which
can be seen in the chart in Figure 2. Additionally, content posted to the social networking
accounts suggest that the actor has an anti-Indian sentiment, which may be a motivating factor
for the actor to participate in such attack campaigns.

We believe the individual associated with the email address “mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com”
was at one time and possibly still involved in web design services, as well as revenue
generating efforts using Google AdSense. Interestingly, it appears that the individual reused
servers and domains set up during web design efforts to host malicious content used in attack
campaigns as well.
The web design and technology services company hosted at “apnits[.]4t[.]com” listed the phone
number “0345-2183117” for its chief executive and as its support number. This phone number is
the same as seen in the registration information in Figure 1 without the country code “+92”. We
did not find any malicious content on this site; however, we did find content that suggests it was
last revised in November 2006.
Another web design company created by the individual was discovered at “xtexhosts.com”. The
phone number “+92.3452183117” was also found in the WHOIS information and was registered
using the email “spid3rsoft [at] gmail.com”. We do not have any indication of malicious content
hosted on xtexhosts.com, but it appears that the actor created it for Xtex Studios, which appears
to be another web design company started by the actor.
We found a third domain, “easternkingsology[.]com,” that contained registration information with
the name “Xtex Studios” and the registration email of “mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com” until the
domain expired in December 2015. The “easternkingsology[.]com” domain hosted a Bozok RAT
sample at hxxp://easternkingsology[.]com/det/dllbb.exe (SHA256:
e4dfcf3db512260e1a4ff414907610d5d5279143fa9ade9219d8691be02e512f), which suggests
the threat actor hosted this Trojan on an Xtex Studios related domain for use in a ProjectM
campaign. Figure 3 shows an advertisement of the services provided by Xtex Studios using
“mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com” and “karachian.gem [at] hotmail.com” for contact purposes.

Figure 3 Website Advertising Xtex Studios Services Linking Two Email Addresses
We found the registration phone number and email address for xtexhosts[.]com on an
advertisement for another web design company called SPID3R[.]SOFT. The advertisement seen
in Figure 4 was hosted on “sahirlodhi[.]com”, which was a domain also used by ProjectM as the
download location for a sample of the Crimson tool. At first we hypothesized that
sahirlodhi[.]com may have been a compromised site, as it appeared to be the official site for the
Pakistani television actor Sahir Lodhi. On May 10, 2008, the domain registration information
was updated to include the registrant email of “mshoaib.yaseen[at]gmail.com”, suggesting the
threat actor was involved in the creation of this website. The registration information for this
domain remained the same until May 21, 2014 when it was updated to include WHOIS privacy
protection. We believe that the threat actor still had access to the sahirlodhi[.]com webserver
and used it to host the payload for ProjectM, further suggesting that the actor reuses domains
and servers to host content and payloads unrelated to its original purpose.

In addition to xtexhosts[.]com, the domain “thefriendsmedia[.]com” was also registered using the
email “spid3rsoft[at]gmail.com”. This domain hosts a multimedia website that claims it is “Asia’s
Biggest Entertainment Portal”. Unit 42 saw this domain hosting several ProjectM tools, including
the exact same Andromeda and Peppy samples as those previously observed using
bbmdroid[.]com as a C2, which were hosted at “/est/estma.exe” and “/est/controller.exe”
respectively.
The “thefriendsmedia[.]com” site makes references to “thefriendsfm[.]com”, which was originally
registered in October 2010 using the email “mshoaib.yaseen[at]gmail.com”. On March 24, 2014,
the actor shared a link on his Facebook (figure 5) and Google+ accounts to an article hosted on
“thefriendsfm[.]com” titled “MOD Assistant Director and Staff Grade NTS Results 2014”, which is
currently still present on the “thefriendsmedia[.]com” domain. The post discusses applying for
positions at the Pakistani Ministry of Defense (MOD), but we do not have any conclusive
evidence that the actor applied to or is connected in anyway with the MOD.

The email address “karachian.gem[at]hotmail.com” seen in the advertisement of Xtex Studios
led to the discovery of the possible identity of an individual that is likely involved with ProjectM.
Unit 42 found the individual’s Google+ profile, seen in Figure 6 and noticed that the profile had
several posts that included domains that had hosted payloads or were C2 servers associated
with ProjectM, such as:
bbmdroid[.]com (Peppy, Bozok)
shobitech[.]com (Peppy, DarkComet, Andromeda)
mustache-styles[.]com (Andromeda)
messagerieneuf[.]com (Crimson)
sahirlodhi[.]com (Crimson)

Figure 6 Possible Actor Involved with ProjectM
Also, Facebook and Google+ posts include “Bind an exe in excel file | Microsoft Excel Exploit |
ShobiTech” (Figure 7), which is interesting as ProjectM has used malicious Excel delivery

documents with macros to download and install payloads in its attack campaign.

Figure 7 – Actor discusses technique seen in campaigns
The “shobitech[.]com” domain also appeared in one of the actor’s Facebook accounts. This
Facebook account provided a great deal of information about the actor, specifically in the photos
section. The actor used the shobitech[.]com domain in 2013 to host details of a training course
(Figure 8) that he was conducting on how to monetize YouTube using Google AdSense.

Figure 8 Advertisement Associated with a Training Conducted by Actor
The photos also show the actor obtained a certificate for completing the “Windows Exploit
Development Megaprimer” online course hosted on udemy.com and screenshots of the actor
using various offensive security tools, such as Metasploit on Kali Linux (Figure 9). The
Operation Transparent Tribe report suggested that Meterpreter samples were used as payloads
in the campaign, which is interesting as Meterpreter is part of the Metasploit Framework that the
individual has had experience with according to the photos uploaded to his Facebook account.

Furthermore, another Facebook account belonging to this actor points to “shoaibyaseen[.]com”,
which appears to host this individual’s personal blog. The blog has a total of twelve posts
between February 29, 2016, and March 2, 2016. The topics posted to this blog include network
port scanning and data gathering techniques, as well as commands to run using Metasploit and
Meterpreter to accomplish various tasks to exploit systems and carry out post-exploitation
activities. While the use of Meterpreter in Figure 9 and the topics in the “shoaibyaseen[.]com”
blog in Figure 10 do not directly implicate this individual, it does strongly suggest that he
possesses skills that would be valuable to offensive campaigns like those conducted by
ProjectM.

activities
Another interesting observation about this actor is that his name shows up in the debug symbol
path of several Crimson tools. The actor’s name appears in the debug symbol path of samples
of the Crimson downloader and the remote administration tool, suggesting the actor may have
been involved with the development of this Trojan. For instance, the following shows an
example of the actor’s name in the debug symbol path of a Crimson downloader (SHA256:
dc8bd60695070152c94cbeb5f61eca6e4309b8966f1aa9fdc2dd0ab754ad3e4c):

Client\secure_scan\secure_scan\obj\x86\Debug\secure_scan.pdb

The email address “karachian.gem[at]hotmail.com” also led us to the individual’s blogger
account, which was created in April 2008. The “About Me” section of this blogger account states
that this individual lives in Karachi, Pakistan and studied computer science. This account also
created several other blogs as well, most of which had little content of interest with the following
exceptions:
bbmdroid[.]blogspot[.]com
indian-attack[.]blogspot[.]com
Freeowlsofminerva[.]blogspot[.]com

Figure 11 Picture of Individual Associated with Blogger Accounts
The first related blog of interest is bbmdroid[.]blogspot[.]com that contains a link to
“bbmdroid[.]com”, which hosted C2 services for various ProjectM tools. The indianattack[.]blogspot[.]com does not contain any malicious exploit code or payloads, but has a
theme of terrorism in India. A blog with a theme related to India closely resembles the India
News Tribe (intribune[.]blogspot[.]com) blog that ProjectM used in Operation Transparent Tribe
to deliver Crimson payloads.
The “freeowlsofminerva[.]blogspot[.]com” blog was created on August 24, 2013, to offer a
service for players of the MapleStory MMORPG. The links on the blog point to Excel
spreadsheets hosted on “microsoftexcel[.]united-host[.]us”, such as:
hxxp://microsoftexcel[.]united-host[.]us/Downloads/(Bera)%20FM%20Price%20List.xls
The blog also includes a link at the bottom of the page to a VirusTotal scan of a file named
“(Bera) FM Price List.xlsx” that showed that no antivirus vendors detected the file as malicious.
We do not have access to the spreadsheets hosted “microsoftexcel[.]united-host[.]us” to confirm
if they were malicious or not; however, we did observe a DarkComet payload (SHA256:
cc488690ce442e9f98bac651218f4075ca36c355d8cd83f7a9f5230970d24157) hosted on this
server at “microsoftexcel[.]united-host[.]us/update.exe”. The fact that a payload was hosted on
this server leads us to believe the inclusion of the link to a VirusTotal analysis is a social
engineering attempt to increase the likelihood a victim would click the links.

Figure 12 Use of VirusTotal Report to Increase Likelihood of Victim Clicking Links

ProjectM is a threat group conducting targeted attacks on government and military personnel of
India. Unit 42 has linked several different domains within ProjectM’s infrastructure to an
individual residing in Pakistan. This corresponds with the suspicions of David Sancho and Feike
Hacquebord at Trend Micro, who documented a likely Pakistani link to the activity in their
Operation C-Major report.
At this time, we cannot elaborate on the extent of this individual’s involvement with the targeted
attacks; however, it does appear that the individual was involved with setting up some portion of
the infrastructure used by the various payloads delivered in the attack campaign. According to
the individual’s social media pages and blogs, it strongly suggests he possesses skills to carry
out offensive activities in ProjectM campaigns. Also, the individual’s name appearing within
Crimson Trojan samples suggests that he may have been involved with the creation of the
malware as well.
Trend Micro reported finding gigabytes of personal identifiable information (PII) in open
directories on C2 servers related to ProjectM, mostly belonging to Indian Army personnel.
Although such PII might be used for financial gain, we find multiple instances in social media
and blogs where this actor states anti-Indian sentiments, suggesting he is potentially politically
motivated.
While knowing the identity and motivations of a possible actor is not necessarily actionable from
a defensive perspective, it does provide a good reminder that people are always behind an
attack, as it is easy to become fixated solely on the technical aspects of malware and
infrastructure.
