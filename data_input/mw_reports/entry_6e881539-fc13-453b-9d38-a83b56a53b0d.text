Clipper Malware disguised as AvD Crypto Stealer
Information stealing malware is on the rise. Cyble Research Labs recently discovered a new malware
dubbed “AvD crypto stealer” on a cybercrime forum. Upon further investigation, however, we observed
that this does not function as a Crypto Stealer. This is, in fact, a disguised variant of well-known Clipper
malware that can read and edit any text copied by the victim i.e. crypto wallet information.
The TA is providing one month of free access to entice more individuals to use it. Anyone can become a
victim of this malware – though the primary target appears to be other TAs.
The Threat Actor (TA) claims that the stealer supports six cryptocurrency chains, including Ethereum,
Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche, and Arbitrum.
The TA targets victims by changing the crypto addresses present in the clipboard. As for crypto
transactions, individuals typically copy the crypto addresses, and the malware takes advantage of this by
replacing the copied crypto wallet address with the one specified by TA.

If the victim does not validate the copied and the pasted values, then the transaction might end up in the
account specified by TA. This clipper malware can also identify the crypto addresses present amongst
multiple strings, expanding this malware’s capabilities.

Technical Analysis
The execution of malware starts from an installation file, which is Self-Extracting. Self-extracting
archives, also known as SFX files, are Windows executable files that, upon execution, extract the
compressed content. Figure 2 showcases the installation wizard.

Figure 2: Installation Wizard
The installation file drops the files shown in Figure 3 and executes the payload named ‘Payload.exe.’
The dropped files also contain manuals for using the builder and the binaries.

The payload file
(SHA256:b6135c446093a19544dbb36018adb7139aa810a3f3eaa45663dc54448fe30e39) is a .NET
based binary. Figure 4 shows the payload details.

Figure 4: File information
Figure 5 shows the process flow for the clipper malware. The malware extracts the data from the
clipboard and then uses a regular expression to find the crypto addresses. If there’s a match, the
malware replaces the address with one specified by TA.

Clipper malware has the following class names:
Program:
This class contains the main function which executes the clipper functionalities. Upon execution, the
main program creates a random mutex named “XWj1iK27ngY68XUB” to ensure that only one instance
of the malware process runs at any given time. If it fails to create a mutex, the malware terminates its
execution.

Figure 6: Main function
After creating the mutex, the malware copies itself into the startup location to establish its persistence
and executes ClipboardNotification.NotificationForm() function. Through this, the malware monitors the
user’s clipboard activity, identifies crypto address, and replaces it with the attacker’s address details.
Clipboard Notification:
This class monitors the user’s clipboard activity and notify when the user copies something into the
clipboard.
Addresses:
This class contains the config details, including crypto addresses, mutex name, and the targeted
cryptocurrencies, as shown in Figure 7. The clipper targets Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Monero (XMR)
crypto addresses.

Clipboard:
The class contains two function names, GetText() and SetText().

These functions get the clipboard text from the user. If there is a crypto wallet in the copied text, these
functions will then set it to the attacker’s wallet address by replacing the copied user’s wallet address.
Clipboard is also responsible for sending the data for logging purposes to the URL present in the
Addresses class.

PatternRegex:
This class contains the regex pattern to identify the crypto addresses copied to the clipboard.

On further investigation into one of the hardcoded crypto addresses in the payload, we found the
following transaction details, as shown below.

Conclusion:
Threat Actors continue to exploit the human element for executing their attacks, as they see it as a
vulnerability – this malware works on a similar attack vector. However, we can reduce the impact of this
malware by being more cautious while making crypto transactions.
There are multiple possibilities in which this attack can escalate. In one of the scenarios, the malware
creator can target other TA’s who use the builder for customizing the crypto stealer and their victims. This
clipper can do financial theft at a great level, so it becomes necessary to take preventive measures.

Our Recommendations:
Avoid downloading pirated software from warez/torrent websites. The “Hack Tool” present on sites
such as YouTube, torrent sites, etc., primarily contains such malware.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their
authenticity.
In the case of businesses, educate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like
phishing’s/untrusted URLs.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.
