NetSupport Manager is a remote control tool that can be installed and used by ordinary or
corporate users for the purpose of remotely controlling systems. However, it is being abused
by many threat actors because it allows external control over specific systems.
Unlike backdoors and RATs (Remote Access Trojans), which are mostly based on command
lines, remote control tools (Remote Administration Tools) place emphasis on userfriendliness, so they offer remote desktops, also known as GUI environments. Even though
they may not have been developed with malicious intent, if they are installed on infected
systems, they can be used for malicious purposes by threat actors, such as for the
installation of additional malware or information extortion.
As most remote control tools are used by countless users unlike other backdoors, it is easy
for them to be recognized as normal programs. Thus, they have the advantage of allowing
attackers to use remote control tools, which are normal programs, to bypass the detection of
security software, while simultaneously enabling domination over the infected system in a
GUI environment.
The following ASEC blog post covers cases where various remote control tools such as
AnyDesk, TeamViewer, Ammyy Admin, and Tmate were used in attacks.

The ASEC analysis team recently found that the NetSupport RAT malware is being
distributed from a phishing page disguised as one for a Pokemon card game. Additionally,
because it was not distributed in a form used for normal purposes but rather in a form
designed for the threat actor to control the infected system, this blog will refer to it as
“NetSupport RAT.” NetSupport RAT has been consistently used by threat actors and is still in
use even in recent days. It’s distributed via spam emails or phishing pages disguised as
those for original programs.
The following is the phishing page disguised as one for a Pokemon card game, and you can
see the “Play on PC” button down below. When the user clicks this button to install the game,
instead of the Pokemon card game, NetSupport RAT is downloaded.

The downloaded file has both a disguised icon and version information, so users are prone
to mistaking this for a game program and running it.

The malware is an installer malware developed with InnoSetup. When executed, it creates a
folder in the %APPDATA% path and creates hidden NetSupport RAT-related files before
executing them. It also creates a shortcut in the Startup folder, allowing the malware to be
run even after a reboot. client32.exe, the ultimately executed file in the process tree below, is
the NetSupport Manager client.

While it could be said that the installed NetSupport-related programs themselves are normal
programs, we can see that the threat actor’s C&C server address is included in the
“client32.ini” configuration file, as shown below. When NetSupport is executed, it reads this
configuration file, access and establishes a connection to the threat actor’s NetSupport
server, and then allows the operator to control the infected system.

While relevant files were being examined with our ASD (AhnLab Smart Defense)
infrastructure and VirusTotal, we identified a different phishing page with the same format as
a fake Pokemon card game page. Each phishing page has been distributing multiple
NetSupport RAT Dropper malware since around December 2022. Moreover, while the files
themselves are all different, they all include the same C&C server address in the “client32.ini”
configuration file.
Among the ones uploaded to VirusTotal, there were malware samples with icons disguised
as Visual Studio, and just like the original program, NetSupport RAT is installed in the path
%APPDATA%\Developer\. From this, we can infer that the threat actor is using normal
programs other than the Pokemon game to distribute malware.

There was also a type that creates the file “csvs.exe” disguised as a normal Windows
program, svchost.exe, instead of installing the NetSupport client, “client32.exe” in the
installation directory. While the icon and file size are different, the internal routine or PDB
information shows that this is a “client32.exe” file modified by the threat actor to bypass
detection.

NetSupport RAT is being used by various threat actors. Major cases show that they are
recently being distributed through spam emails disguised as those for invoices, shipment
documents, and purchase orders.[1] Additionally, in the second half of the year, there was a
case where users were led to install the malware themselves from a phishing page disguised
as an update page for a software called SocGholish.[2]
When NetSupport RAT is installed, the threat actor can gain control over the infected system.
Features supported by NetSupport by default include not only remote screen control but also
system control features such as screen capture, clipboard sharing, collecting web history
information, file management, and command execution. This means that the threat actor can
perform various malicious behaviors such as extorting user credentials and installing
additional malware.

Recently, threat actors have been abusing remote control tools used by various users such
as NetSupport in their attacks. When infected with such remote control malware, the system
is overtaken by the threat actor and becomes subject to damages such as information
extortion and additional malware installation.
When installing externally sourced software, users are advised to purchase or download
them from their official websites and refrain from opening attachments in suspicious emails.
Users should also apply the latest patch to programs such as their OS and internet browsers
and update V3 to the latest version to prevent malware infection in advance.
