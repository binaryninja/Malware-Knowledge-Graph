The double extortion business: Conti Ransomware Gang
finds new avenues of negotiation

Justin Fier, Director of Cyber Intelligence & Analytics | Wednesday December 8, 2021
In a previous blog, we outlined how the Ryuk ransomware strain developed by Russian
hacking group ‘Wizard Spider’ has fallen into the hands of small-time cyber criminals.
Wizard Spider – who allegedly operate with support from the Russian government and
remain under investigation by the FBI and Interpol – adopted Ryuk ransomware’s successor
‘Conti’ in 2020. Conti affects all Windows operating systems and has been involved in more
than 400 incidents. Wizard Spider were soon rebranded in cyber press as the ‘Conti
Ransomware Gang’, though the group does not necessarily see itself as a ‘gang’. It prefers
to present itself as a business.

The ransomware bubble
Ransomware has become a multibillion-dollar industry – and the Conti Ransomware Gang
reportedly made up 15% of it in 2020. With this scale of income, groups like Conti find
themselves adopting some crude imitations of legitimate business practice. This corporate
mimicry dictates that their victims be called ‘customers’, their extortion attempts ‘negotiations’
and their criminal peers ‘affiliates’. They even publish ‘press releases’ via a dedicated Dark
Web site.

The gang’s Ransomware-as-a-Service ‘business model’ consists of employing affiliates,
training them in Conti ransomware’s deployment and management, and then taking 30% of
the profits themselves. With exact profits known only to the malware writers and not the
affiliates, however, the percentage Conti takes is often much higher than the 30% they claim.
There may not be checks and regulations in place to address fraud in the cyber underworld,
but one business complication which Conti have not been able to escape is that of the
disgruntled employee.
Unhappy with the malpractice of their superiors, an underpaid affiliate leaked the Conti
Ransomware Gang’s training materials and the IP addresses for their Cobalt Strike C2
servers in August 2021, declaring, “they recruit suckers and divide the money among
themselves”.
Meanwhile, the US Government has also been taking action to try to disrupt the profit
margins of groups like the Conti Ransomware Gang, going as far as to impose sanctions on
cryptocurrency exchanges seen as facilitating ransomware transactions. However, leaks and
legislation have proved far from fatal for Conti.
The reality is that these actions have not lost the Conti Ransomware Gang any of its socalled “customers”, and where there are customers there is profit. Any individual or
organization entrusting their cyber security to conventional, rules-based measures is in their
target market.
Darktrace’s AI recently detected a Conti attack conducted along the lines of one of the
methods outlined in the August leak. The target organization – a US transportation company
– was trialling Darktrace but, without Darktrace’s Autonomous Response set in active mode,
the attack was allowed to go ahead. In examining how it progressed, however, it should
become clear not only how threatening double extortion ransomware attacks like this one
can be, but also how effectively they can be stopped by Darktrace at each stage of the
attack.
Figure 1: Timeline of the attack

Conti Ransomware Gang diversifies the ransomware playbook
A single uninstalled Microsoft patch had left the target organization with dangerous
ProxyShell vulnerabilities. Conti exploited these vulnerabilities, quickly gaining the rights to
remotely execute Exchange PowerShell commands on the company’s server and steadily
broadened its presence within the digital environment. This is a relatively new approach for
the Conti Ransomware Gang, who previously relied upon phishing attacks and firewall
exploits. By diversifying its approach, it stays ahead of patches and intelligence.

Two weeks after the initial breach, C2 connections were made to an unusual endpoint
located in Finland using an SSL client which appeared innocuous but was 100% rare for the
organization. Had Autonomous Response been set in active mode, Darktrace would have
shut the connections down at this very early stage.
The IP address of this suspicious endpoint has since been identified as a Conti IoC (Indicator
of Compromise), allowing it to be incorporated into rules-based security solutions. This would
have done little good for the company in question, however, which was breached weeks
before this intelligence was made available.
As Conti continued to conduct internal reconnaissance and move laterally through the
company’s digital environment, Darktrace detected further unusual activity. The suspicious
Finnish endpoint then employed new ‘Living off the Land’ techniques, installing the usually
legitimate tools AnyDesk and Cobalt Strike onto various parts of the environment.
A series of SSL connections were made to AnyDesk endpoints and external hosts, one of
which lasted 95 hours, indicating an active remote session conducted by one of Conti’s
affiliates. At this stage, Darktrace had 10 distinct reasons to suspect an imminent attack.

Conti News: Closing the deal with double extortion ransomware
Double extortion has become the Conti Ransomware Gang’s new favourite sales tactic. If
you refuse to pay its ransom, Conti will not only take your most important files from you, but
also exfiltrate and publish them using its dedicated ‘Conti News’ website, or sell them directly
to your competitors.
Having expanded their reach across the transport company’s network, the Conti affiliate
began rapidly exfiltrating large quantities of company data to Conti’s preferred cloud storage
site, MEGA. Over four days, more than 3TB of data was uploaded, and then encrypted.
To avoid detection by a human security team, encryption was launched at close to midnight –
Conti’s ‘business’ does not respect business hours. When the company’s security team
returned to work the next day, they were met with a ransom note.
All of your files are currently encrypted by CONTI strain. ... .As you know (if you don’t
just “google it“), all of the data that has been encrypted by our software cannot be
recovered by any means without contacting our team directly. .. If you try to use any
additional recovery software — the files might be damaged, so if you are willing to try
— try it on the data of the lowest value... . To make sure that we REALLY CAN get your
data back — we offer you to decrypt 2 random files completely free of charge.
YOU SHOULD BE AWARE ! Just in case, if you try to ignore us. We’ve downloaded a
pack of your internal data and are ready to publish it on our news website if you do not
respond. So it will be better for both sides if you contact us as soon as possible.

This attack was able to progress because Darktrace was only being trialed at this stage and
was therefore allowed to detect threats but not to take action against them. With
Autonomous Response employed in active mode, this ransomware attack would have ended
in the very early stages, when Darktrace detected its first suspicious connections.
Nonetheless, the Cyber AI Analyst was able to investigate and connect the dots of the attack
automatically, making the organization’s remediation efforts drastically quicker and easier
than they would have been without even this partial Darktrace deployment.

How the Conti Ransomware Gang evades cyber intelligence
Security systems that rely on human intelligence to detect threats fit Conti’s ideal customer
profile perfectly. By adapting and diversifying their approach, moving from Ryuk to Conti, and
from spear phishing and firewall exploits to this new ProxyShell approach, Conti stay ahead
of regulations and hold on to their vulnerable customer base.
Even if the Conti Ransomware Gang is brought down by leaks or legislation, other groups
will rise to fill the gap in the market, eager for their own cut of the illicit gains. If these groups
are to be truly stopped, they must be made unprofitable.
The US government has tried to do this by imposing fines upon ransom payers, but
companies still often consider the losses involved in not recovering their data too great. As I
have argued previously, ‘to pay or not to pay,’ is not the question we should be asking.
If you’re deciding whether to pay or not to pay, you’re already too far down the line.
Darktrace stops groups like Conti at the first encounter. As this case has shown, Darktrace’s
Self-Learning AI is able to identify threats weeks before human analysts and threat
intelligence can do the same, and neutralize them at every stage of an attack with
Autonomous Response.
