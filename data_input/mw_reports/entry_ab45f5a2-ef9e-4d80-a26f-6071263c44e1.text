Executive Summary
Hancitor is an information stealer and malware downloader used by a threat actor designated as
MAN1, Moskalvzapoe or TA511. In a threat brief from 2018, we noted Hancitor was relatively
unsophisticated, but it would remain a threat for years to come. Approximately three years later,
Hancitor remains a threat and has evolved to use tools like Cobalt Strike. In recent months, this actor
began using a network ping tool to help enumerate the Active Directory (AD) environment of infected
hosts. This blog illustrates how the threat actor behind Hancitor uses the network ping tool, so security
professionals can better identify and block its use.
As early as October 2020, Hancitor began utilizing Cobalt Strike and some of these infections utilized
a network ping tool to enumerate the infected host’s internal network. Normal ping activity is low to
nonexistent within a Local Area Network (LAN), but this ping tool generates approximately 1.5 GB of

1/16

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic as it pings more than 17 million IP addresses of
internal, non-routable IPv4 address space.
To understand how this ping tool is used, we must first understand the chain of events for current
Hancitor activity. This blog reviews examples of recent Hancitor infections within AD environments.
This blog also contains relatively new indicators noted from this threat actor as of February 2021, and
it provides five examples of the associated network ping tool seen in December 2020 and January
2021.
Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from this threat with a Threat
Prevention security subscription.
Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise
described in this report, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members. CTA members use this
intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically disrupt malicious
cyber actors.

Chain of Events for Recent Hancitor Infections
Since Nov. 5, 2020, the actor pushing Hancitor has displayed consistent patterns of infection activity.
See Figure 1 for a flow chart showing the chain of events.

2/16

Figure 1. Hancitor chain of events.
The chain of events for recent Hancitor infections is:
Email with link to a malicious page hosted on Google Drive.
Link from a Google Drive page to a URL that returns a malicious Word document.
Enable macros (per instructions in Word document text).
Hancitor DLL is dropped and run using rundll32.exe.
Hancitor generates command and control (C2) traffic.
Hancitor C2 most often leads to Ficker Stealer malware.
Hancitor C2 leads to Cobalt Strike activity in AD environments.
Hancitor-related Cobalt Strike activity can send other files, such as a network ping tool or
malware based on the NetSupport Manager Remote Access Tool (RAT).
In rare cases, we have also seen a Hancitor infection follow-up with Send-Safe spambot
malware that turned an infected host into a spambot pushing more Hancitor-based malspam.
After a three-month absence, Hancitor activity resumed on Oct. 20, 2020. By Nov. 5, 2020, this
campaign settled into the infection chain of events shown above.

First Stage: Distributing Malicious Word Documents
Hancitor has historically sent emails spoofing different types of organizations that send notices, faxes
or invoices. Emails spoofing DocSign have been reported as early as October 2017, but the group
behind Hancitor began more frequent use of DocuSign templates starting in October 2019. Currently,
most waves of emails pushing Hancitor have used a DocuSign theme, and the average wave of
Hancitor malspam looks like this one reported on Jan. 12, 2021.
DocuSign-spoofed emails are not new, nor are they limited to Hancitor. DocuSign is well aware of this
activity. The company provides guidance on this issue and a channel to report malicious messages
spoofing their brand.
These DocuSign-themed messages have links to malicious Google Drive pages established through
fraudulent or possibly compromised Google accounts. Cloud-based collaborative services such as
Microsoft’s OneDrive and Google Drive are frequently abused by threat actors to distribute malware.
Google Drive links from emails pushing Hancitor start with
https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX- and end with /pub. This URL pattern has also been
noted pushing other families of malware.
To get a better idea of these URLs, examples from a wave of Hancitor emails on February 8th, 2021,
are shown below in Table 1. Google was notified of these links, and they have been taken offline.

Table 1. Seven examples of malicious Google Drive links from DocuSign-themed emails pushing Hancitor on Feb. 8, 2021.

A recent example from an email is shown below in Figure 2.

4/16

Figure 2. Example of a fake DocuSign email pushing Hancitor from Feb. 2, 2021.
Of note, any Google Drive URL that starts with https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX- and
ends with /pub is not inherently malicious. However, they are definitely suspicious when found in
unsolicited emails.
These Google Drive URLs display a web page with a link to download a Word document. Figure 3
shows an example of these malicious pages using Google Drive.

5/16

Figure 3. Google Drive link from fake DocuSign email on Feb. 2, 2021, shown in a web browser.
These pages link to malicious URLs using Google with various parameters, including the actual
destination URL. In Figure 3 above, a link from a Google Drive page, obtained from a fake DocuSign
email on Feb. 2, 2021, starts innocently enough with https://www.google.com/. However, after clicking
the link, the web browser loads hxxp://ajlbulicidate[.]pt/squriming.php which is actually a malicious
URL. Figure 4 shows the page from ajlbulicidate[.]pt as it is initially loaded.

Figure 4. Web browser immediately after clicking link from the Google Drive page.
The page from ajlbulicidate[.]pt contained a script with base64 text to create a malicious Word
document. This script causes a browser to offer the malicious Word document for download, then it
redirects to a DocuSign page as shown in Figures 5 and 6.

6/16

Figure 5. Base64 text representing malicious Word document in script from web page hosted at
ajlbulicidate[.]pt.

Figure 6. Script offers to save malicious Word document, then redirects to a DocuSign URL.
The page at hxxp://ajlbulicidate[.]pt/squriming.php briefly appears before offering the Word document
for download and redirecting to a DocuSign URL. Potential victims might only notice the DocuSign
page and Word document. See Figure 7 for an example. This technique could lead potential victims to
believe the Word document is a legitimate file sent by DocuSign.

7/16

Figure 7. Web browser a few seconds after clicking link in malicious Google Drive page from Figure 3.
Word documents originating from these DocuSign-themed messages use the template shown below in
Figure 8.

Figure 8. Malicious Word document with macro for Hancitor based on DocuSign-themed malspam.

8/16

DocuSign is not the only theme and template used to push Hancitor. For example, on Feb. 9, 2021,
malspam using a different email and document template pushed Hancitor malware. Except for the
different templates, the infection process remained the same.
Appendix A lists 127 samples of SHA256 hashes for Word documents with macros for Hancitor from
Nov. 5, 2020, through Feb. 25, 2021.

Second Stage: Hancitor Infects Victim
When macros are enabled for these malicious Word documents, the macro code drops and runs a
malicious DLL file for Hancitor. The DLL file is contained within the macro code. In January and
February 2021, these Hancitor DLLs were saved to one of two locations, as shown in Table 2.
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\W0rd.dll
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Static.dll
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP\W0rd.dll
Table 2. Location of Hancitor DLL files.

Figure 9 shows one of the Hancitor DLL files from an infected host on Feb. 2, 2021.

Figure 9. Hancitor DLL from an infected Windows host on Feb. 2, 2021.
These Hancitor DLL files are run with rundll32.exe. An example from Feb. 2, 2021, revealed by
Process Hacker, is shown below in Figure 10.

9/16

Figure 10. Process for Hancitor DLL shown in Process Hacker.
Network traffic caused by Hancitor starts with an IP address check by the infected Windows host. This
IP address check goes to a legitimate service at api.ipify.org. The IP check is immediately followed by
C2 traffic, as shown in a Wireshark column display below in Figure 11.

Figure 11. Wireshark column display showing IP address check and Hancitor C2 URLs.
From November 2020 through February 2021, Hancitor C2 traffic consisted of HTTP POST requests
ending with /8/forum.php. Posted data includes the public IP address of the infected Windows host, the
host name and user account name. Posted data also includes the version of Windows and domain
information if the infected host is part of an AD environment. Finally, posted data also contains a
Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the infected host and a build number for the Hancitor malware
sample. See Figure 12 below for an example of recent Hancitor C2 traffic.

Appendix B lists 63 SHA256 hashes for samples of Hancitor DLL files from Nov. 5, 2020, through Feb.
25, 2021.

Third Stage: Hancitor Retrieves Follow-Up Malware
After Hancitor establishes C2 traffic, it retrieves follow-up malware. Each day, follow-up malware items
for Hancitor are hosted on the same domain. For example, on Feb. 2, 2021, follow-up malware for
Hancitor was hosted at bobcvatofredding[.]com. Table 3 shows a few recent examples of URLs for
follow-up malware by Hancitor.

Send-Safe spambot malware

Table 3. Examples of URLs for follow-up malware seen from recent Hancitor infections.

Hancitor will only send Cobalt Strike when it infects a host in an AD environment. It will not send
Cobalt Strike if the computer is a standalone host like a home computer. Hancitor generally sends
Ficker Stealer for any host it infects.
Post-infection traffic is the easiest way to identify follow-up malware from a Hancitor infection. Ficker
Stealer causes different traffic than Cobalt Strike. Figure 13 shows traffic from an infection on Feb. 2,
2021, and it highlights items related to Ficker Stealer.

Figure 13. Traffic from a Hancitor infection, highlighting items related to Ficker Stealer.
Appendix D contains information on the Ficker Stealer malware samples associated with Hancitor from
October 2020-March 2021.
Figure 14 below shows the same traffic, but it highlights items related to Cobalt Strike.

12/16

Figure 14. Same traffic from a Hancitor infection, highlighting items related to Cobalt Strike.
Ficker Stealer and Cobalt Strike do not leave any artifacts saved to disk on an infected host. Ficker
Stealer is a "smash and grab" style of malware designed to exfiltrate data, and it does not remain on
an infected host. Cobalt Strike is resident in system memory, and it did not survive a reboot in our test
environment.

Final Stage: Cobalt Strike Sends Malware
Cobalt Strike is used by the threat actor behind Hancitor to send follow-up malware. A Hancitor
infection on Feb. 2, 2021, revealed NetSupport Manager RAT was sent after Cobalt Strike activity
started.
Another file that appeared on Hancitor-infected hosts after Cobalt Strike started was a Windows EXE
file for a network ping tool.
This EXE file started appearing as early as Dec. 15, 2020, and we noted various file hashes through at
least Jan. 25, 2021. The network ping tool was always saved to the same directory as the Hancitor
Word document.
Figure 15 shows an example of the tool seen on Jan. 13, 2021, after a Hancitor Word document was
saved to the infected user’s Documents folder.

13/16

Figure 15. An example of the network ping tool from a Hancitor infection with Cobalt Strike on Jan. 13,
2021.
As seen in Figure 15, the EXE file was named xx.exe. A week later on Jan. 20, a new sample of the
same tool was named netpingall.exe, as shown in Figure 16.

Figure 16. An example of the network ping tool from a Hancitor with Cobalt Strike infection on Jan. 20,
2021.
Timestamps from the Jan. 20, 2021, infection show the following:
0120_203089882.doc – Word doc with macros for Hancitor – 16:27 UTC
netpingall.exe – Network ping tool seen after Cobalt Strike - 17:19 UTC
result.txt – Results of the network ping tool scan – 18:18 UTC
An EXE for the network ping tool appeared approximately 52 minutes after the Word document for
Hancitor was saved to disk. Approximately 59 minutes after the network ping tool appeared, the results
of the scan were saved to a text file named result.txt.
This ping tool is designed to find any other active hosts within an AD environment. The tool generates
approximately 1.5 GB of ICMP ping traffic over the network as it pings more than 17 million IP
addresses of internal, non-routable IPv4 address space.
Normally, ping traffic to internal, non-routable IPv4 addresses is almost nonexistent in an AD
environment. Ping traffic within internal IP address space should be limited to the LAN. For example, a
LAN environment for 172.16.1.0/24 consists of 254 internal IP addresses that a host might ping within

14/16

this network. We would not normally see ping traffic to other non-routable IPv4 space outside of those
254 IP addresses.
We tested samples of this ping tool in various sizes of LAN environments, and it consistently
generates 1.5 GB of ICMP ping traffic to more than 17 million non-routable IPv4 addresses.
This is exceedingly noisy traffic. Furthermore, Hancitor has demonstrated a noticeable lack of stealth
in deploying and using this ping tool. Such an unusual EXE file is easy to notice, especially when the
results of its scan are saved as a text file in the same directory.
For Hancitor infections involving this ping tool, the associated files were never deleted after saving the
results to result.txt, so any forensic investigation would quickly find this tool. The 1.5 GB of ICMP traffic
should be very noticeable.
The ping tool generates ICMP ping traffic, first hitting all IP addresses in the 192.168.0.0/16 block.
then it does the 172.16.0.0/12 block, and it finishes with the 10.0.0.0/8 block.

Figure 17. An example of the start of ICMP traffic from one of the network ping tool samples.
Since Jan. 25, 2021, we have not discovered any new ping tool samples from Hancitor infections with
Cobalt Strike. Why can we no longer find it? Perhaps the threat actor behind Hancitor realized how
suspicious this activity is and stopped using it.
Appendix C lists information for five samples of the network ping tool discovered from Hancitor
infections with Cobalt Strike that appeared in December 2020 and January 2021.

Conclusion
Post-infection activity from Hancitor malware has settled into noticeable patterns. These patterns
include the use of Cobalt Strike for a Hancitor infection within an AD environment. In some cases,
follow-up malware sent through Cobalt Strike may include a network ping tool that generates an
abnormally large amount of ICMP traffic as it pings over 17 million internal IPv4 addresses.
Organizations with decent spam filtering, proper system administration and up-to-date Windows hosts
have a much lower risk of infection from Hancitor and its post-infection activity. Palo Alto Networks
Next-Generation Firewall customers are further protected from this threat with a Threat Prevention
security subscription.
