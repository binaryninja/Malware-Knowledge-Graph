In this post, we develop new Internet scanning techniques to identify 45 countries in which
operators of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware may be conducting operations.

Key Findings

2/35

Between August 2016 and August 2018, we scanned the Internet for servers
associated with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. We found 1,091 IP addresses that
matched our fingerprint and 1,014 domain names that pointed to them. We developed
and used Athena, a novel technique to cluster some of our matches into 36 distinct
Pegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator.
We designed and conducted a global DNS Cache Probing study on the matching
domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying. Our
technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be
conducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be
actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.
Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human rights risks of NSO’s global
proliferation. At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously
been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain,
Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
Pegasus also appears to be in use by countries with dubious human rights records and
histories of abusive behaviour by state security services. In addition, we have found
indications of possible political themes within targeting materials in several countries,
casting doubt on whether the technology is being used as part of “legitimate” criminal
investigations.

1. Executive Summary
Israel-based “Cyber Warfare” vendor NSO Group produces and sells a mobile phone
spyware suite called Pegasus. To monitor a target, a government operator of Pegasus must
convince the target to click on a specially crafted exploit link, which, when clicked, delivers a
chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone and installs Pegasus
without the user’s knowledge or permission. Once the phone is exploited and Pegasus is
installed, it begins contacting the operator’s command and control (C&C) servers to receive
and execute operators’ commands, and send back the target’s private data, including
passwords, contact lists, calendar events, text messages, and live voice calls from popular
mobile messaging apps. The operator can even turn on the phone’s camera and microphone
to capture activity in the phone’s vicinity.

information gathered from a device infected with Pegasus. Source: Hacking Team Emails.

4/35

Pegasus exploit links and C&C servers use HTTPS, which requires operators to register and
maintain domain names. Domain names for exploit links sometimes impersonate mobile
providers, online services, banks, and government services, which may make the links
appear to be benign at first glance. An operator may have several domain names that they
use in exploit links they send, and also have several domain names they use for C&C. The
domain names often resolve to cloud-based virtual private servers (we call these front-end
servers) rented either by NSO Group or the operator. The front-end servers appear to
forward traffic (via a chain of other servers) to servers located on the operator’s premises
(we call these the back-end Pegasus servers).

Scanning, Clustering, and DNS Cache Probing
In August 2016, award-winning UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor was targeted with NSO
Group’s Pegasus spyware. We clicked on the link he was sent and obtained three zero-day
exploits for the Apple iPhone, as well as a copy of the Pegasus spyware. We fingerprinted
the behaviour of the exploit link and C&C servers in the sample sent to Mansoor, and
scanned the Internet for other matching front-end servers. We found 237 servers. After we
clicked on the link, but before we published our findings on August 24, NSO Group had
apparently taken down all of the Pegasus front-end servers we detected. In the weeks after
our report, we noticed a small number of Pegasus front-end servers come back online, but
the servers no longer matched our fingerprint. We developed a new fingerprint and began
conducting regular Internet scans.
Between August 2016 and August 2018, we detected 1,091 IP addresses and 1,014 domain
names matching our fingerprint. We developed and used Athena, a novel fingerprinting
technique to group most of our results into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one perhaps
run by a separate operator (Section 2).
We next sought to identify where these Pegasus systems were being used. We hypothesized
that devices infected with Pegasus would regularly look up one or more of the domain names
for the operator’s Pegasus front-end servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. We regularly
probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world via DNS forwarders looking
for the Pegasus domain names (Section 3).

Our Findings
We found suspected NSO Pegasus infections associated with 33 of the 36 Pegasus
operators we identified in 45 countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote
d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait,
Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan,
Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland,
Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the

5/35

United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen, and Zambia. As our findings are based on country-level
geolocation of DNS servers, factors such as VPNs and satellite Internet teleport locations
can introduce inaccuracies.

Mexico
In 2017, we discovered, by retrospectively inspecting their text messages, that dozens of
Mexican lawyers, journalists, human rights defenders, opposition politicians, anti-corruption
advocates, and an international investigation operating in Mexico were targeted in 2016 with
links to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. The Mexico revelations sparked a major political
scandal, #GobiernoEspía, and an ensuing criminal investigation, ongoing as of the date of
this report. Even after our prior reporting on the abuse of the Pegasus spyware in Mexico, it
appears that there are three separate operators who operate predominantly in Mexico as of
July 2018.
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries
We identify what appears to be a significant expansion of Pegasus usage in the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. In total, we identify at least six
operators with significant GCC operations, including at least two that appear to
predominantly focus on the UAE, one that appears to predominantly focus on Bahrain, and
one with a Saudi focus. Three operators may be conducting surveillance beyond the MENA
region, including in Canada, France, Greece, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

6/35

The GCC countries are well known for abusing surveillance tools to track dissidents. In
August 2016, UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor was targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus
spyware after previously being targeted with spyware from FinFisher and Hacking Team.
Bahrain is noteworthy for compromising journalists, lawyers, opposition politicians, and prodemocracy activists with FinFisher’s spyware between 2010 and 2012. In May and June
2018, Amnesty International reported that an Amnesty staffer and a Saudi activist based
abroad were targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. The same operator responsible
for that targeting appears to be conducting surveillance across the Middle East, as well as in
Europe and North America. Saudi Arabia is currently seeking to execute five nonviolent
human rights activists accused of chanting slogans at demonstrations and publishing protest
videos on social media.
Other Country Contexts
We identify five operators focusing on Africa, including one that appears to be predominantly
focusing on the West African country of Togo, a staunch Israel ally whose long-serving
President has employed torture and excessive force against peaceful opposition. The
operator in Togo may have used websites with names like “nouveau president” (“new
president”) and “politiques infos” (“political information”) to infect targets with spyware. A
separate operator that appears to focus on Morocco may also be spying on targets in other
countries including Algeria, France, and Tunisia. We identify several operators operating in
Israel: four that appear to operate domestically1 and one that appears to operate both in
Israel, as well as other countries including the Netherlands, Palestine, Qatar, Turkey, and the
USA.

2. Fingerprinting Pegasus Infrastructure
This section describes how we traced Pegasus infrastructure, from our initial discovery in
2016 until the present.

Background
We first began tracking NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware after the operators of UAE threat
actor Stealth Falcon (later revealed to be UAE cybersecurity company DarkMatter)
inadvertently gave us visibility into Pegasus infrastructure by registering a domain name
whose homepage included a Pegasus link, using the same email address as a domain for a
separate PC spyware product we were tracking. In August 2016, UAE activist Ahmed
Mansoor was targeted with Pegasus with a text message sent to his iPhone. We clicked on
the link provided in the message and obtained three zero-day exploits for Apple iOS 9.3.3, as
well as a copy of the Pegasus spyware. We disclosed the exploits to Apple, which quickly
released a patch blocking the Pegasus spyware. According to our scans, all of the Pegasus
servers we detected (except for the C&C servers in the sample sent to Mansoor) were shut
down at least two days before we published our results.

7/35

Fingerprinting in 2016: Decoy Pages
When we sought to build fingerprints for Pegasus infrastructure in 2016, we scanned the
Internet for /redirect.aspx and /Support.aspx , for which Pegasus servers returned
decoy pages. A decoy page is a page shown when there is an undesired remote landing on
a spyware server and is designed to convince the user that they are viewing a normal,
benign website. However, because the functionality for showing decoy pages typically
resides in the spyware server’s code and likely nowhere else, it is often trivial for researchers
to build fingerprints for decoy pages, and scan the Internet for these fingerprints to identify
other servers associated with the same spyware system, including perhaps the servers of
other operators, if the same spyware system is used by multiple operators.

Fingerprinting in 2017 and 2018: No More Decoys
After our August 2016 report, NSO Group apparently removed the /redirect.aspx and
/Support.aspx decoy pages, and further modified their server code to close an incoming
connection without returning any data unless presented with a valid exploit link or other path
on the server. This change is in line with changes made by competitors FinFisher and
Hacking Team, after we disclosed how we fingerprinted their hidden infrastructure with decoy
pages.
After studying the behavior of several suspected new Pegasus servers, we developed
fingerprints ξ1, ξ2, and ξ3, and a technique that we call Athena.2 Fingerprint ξ1 is a Transport
Layer Security (TLS) fingerprint. Fingerprints ξ2 and ξ3 represent two different proxying
configurations we observed. We considered a server to be part of NSO Group’s
infrastructure if it matched ξ1 and also one of ξ2 or ξ3. We then used Athena to group our
fingerprint matches into 36 clusters. We believe that each cluster represents an operator of
NSO Pegasus spyware, though it is possible that some may represent demonstration or
testing systems. As we have done in the past when reporting on vendors of targeted
malware, we have chosen to withhold publication of specific fingerprints and techniques to
prevent harm that may result from external parties generating a list of NSO Group domains
using these methods.

Charting the Rebirth of Pegasus
NSO Group apparently told business associates that our August 2016 report and disclosures
of their exploits to Apple “…disrupted their work for around 30 minutes before they…
resumed operations.” Our scanning of NSO Group’s infrastructure tells a somewhat different
story (Figure 4).

8/35

Figure 4: Pegasus servers available over time.
Twelve of the servers that were shut down before we published Million Dollar Dissident (we
call these Version 2 servers) were back online in a September 25, 2016 scan and stayed
online mostly continuously until an August 10, 2017 scan. These may have been C&C
servers for clients that wished to continue monitoring old infections. We saw the first Version
3 server in a September 5, 2017 scan, less than two weeks after Million Dollar Dissident.
Approximately one month after Million Dollar Dissident, we saw what appeared to be seven
operators online. Two months after our report, we saw 14 operators online.

3. DNS Cache Probing Results
This section describes the results of our DNS Cache Probing study to identify suspected
Pegasus infections (see Section 4 for study details, as well as the definition of a “suspected
infection”).

Background
We used the technique that we call Athena to cluster the IP addresses that matched our
Pegasus fingerprints into what we believe are 36 distinct operators; each operator makes
use of multiple IP addresses. We give each operator an Operator Name drawn from national
symbols or geographic features of the country or region that appears to be targeted. For
each IP address used by the operator, we extracted a domain name from its TLS certificate.
We coded the domain names to generate a Suspected Country Focus and assessed
whether there were Political Themes in the domains, which might suggest politically
motivated targeting. We then performed DNS cache probing to generate a list of countries in
which there are Possible Infections associated with the operator.

Operators Focusing on the Americas
9/35

We identified five or six operators that we believe are operating in the Americas.
One operator that we call MACAW may be focused on Honduras or neighboring countries
because it made use of two interesting domain names showing a possible link to Honduras
(politica504[.]com and eltiempo-news[.]com). However, our DNS cache probing technique
did not identify any suspected infections relating to this system.
At the time of our June 2017 Reckless Exploit report about the abuse of NSO Group’s
Pegasus spyware in Mexico, there were four operators using domain names that suggested
a link to Mexico: RECKLESS-1, RECKLESS-2, PRICKLYPEAR, and AGUILAREAL.
RECKLESS-1 and RECKLESS-2 employed some domain names containing political themes
(RECKLESS-1 used universopolitico[.]net and animal-politico[.]com; RECKLESS-2 used
noticiaspoliticos[.]com and politicoportales[.]org). Operators RECKLESS-1 and RECKLESS2 are so named because they were swiftly and completely shut down following publication of
our report. Operators PRICKLYPEAR and AGUILAREAL were partially shut down: two or
three servers for each remained online. One month after publication, in July 2017, the first
domain names for a new operator, MAYBERECKLESS, that would focus on Mexico were
registered. The MAYBERECKLESS domains began matching our fingerprint in September
2017. MAYBERECKLESS may be a continuation of RECKLESS-1 or RECKLESS-2. Also in
September 2017, the remaining servers from PRICKLYPEAR and AGUILAREAL were
supplemented with new servers.

Operators Focusing on Africa

10/35

We identified five operators that we believe are focusing on Africa. One operator that we call
REDLIONS uses frontend domains that appear to be almost exclusively written in the French
language, including two politically themed domains (politiques-infos[.]info and nouveaupresident[.]com). We found DNS cache probing hits for REDLIONS in Togo. Because we did
not perform our DNS cache probing study until July 2018, we did not have the opportunity to
probe one operator, AK47, which shut down in July 2017. Operators ATLAS and
GRANDLACS also made use of politically themed domains (ATLAS used revolutionnews[.]co and GRANDLACS used politicalpress[.]org).

Operators Focusing on the Middle East
We identified 12 operators that we believe are focusing on the Middle East. One operator,
PEARL, appears to be focused on Bahrain. One operator, KINGDOM, was behind the recent
targeting of an Amnesty staffer and a Saudi Arabian activist abroad. Operator PEARL used
politically themed domain names including shia-voice[.]com (referring to a politically
repressed religious group in Bahrain) and 14-tracking[.]com (perhaps referring to the
February 14 Youth Coalition, a group leading some anti-government protests), and operator
FALCON used nomorewarnow[.]com.

Highly Customized Operators with Unclear Focus
We identified three operators with an unclear focus, which all appeared to use a large degree
of customization in their operations.
Operator SUPERSIZE (active Sep 2016 – present) had by far the largest Pegasus
deployment based on number of domain names; we found 118 domain names belonging to
SUPERSIZE. We found interesting DNS cache hits in Israel and Bahrain, but did not have
enough information to determine whether these might be suspected infections. It may be the
13/35

case that SUPERSIZE was monitoring relatively few people with a relatively large amount of
infrastructure, or that some of SUPERSIZE’s targets may have been outside areas we could
measure with DNS cache probing, or that SUPERSIZE was operating in an especially
stealthy manner with targets under sporadic, rather than continuous, surveillance.
Operator SNEAK (active Oct 2016 – present) had infrastructure that appeared to reflect a
high level of customization, including running C&C servers on nonstandard ports, and
making use of dynamic DNS services. SNEAK was the operator that accidentally reused
some of its old infrastructure, facilitating our continued visibility into NSO Group’s
infrastructure after our Million Dollar Dissident report. We found interesting DNS cache hits
on this system in Syria, Lebanon, Qatar, the Netherlands, and the United States, but did not
have enough information to determine whether these might be suspected infections.
Operator PARTY (active May 2017 – present) used domain names with extremely long TTLs.
We found interesting DNS cache hits on this system in Syria and Lebanon, but did not have
enough information to determine whether these might be suspected infections.

4. DNS Cache Probing Technique
This section describes our DNS Cache Probing technique.

Background on DNS and Cache Probing
When a user (or a computer program) instructs a computer or mobile device to communicate
with a domain name (e.g., www.citizenlab.ca), the device first sends a request to a Domain
Name Service (DNS) server, in order to learn the IP address corresponding to the domain
name. By default, the device communicates with a DNS server maintained by the ISP or
telecom company to which the device is connected.
DNS servers cache mappings between IP addresses and domain names temporarily,
typically for a duration specified by the owner of the domain name (e.g., 300 seconds). When
a device looks up a domain name that is not in the server’s cache, the server contacts other
DNS servers to resolve the domain name “recursively” and then stores the record in the
cache. When a device looks up a domain name that is already in the server’s cache, the
server returns the record from the cache, along with a time to live (TTL) value, that indicates
when the server will expire the record from the cache. If the TTL value returned by the server
is less than that set by the owner of the domain, then it is likely that the record returned by
the DNS server was present in the server’s cache, and thus was looked up by some other
ISP user relatively recently.
One can also send a query to a DNS server with the Recursion Desired flag set to 0 (called a
nonrecursive query), indicating to the server that it should only consult its cache before
responding; if the record is not in the cache, the server should not contact other servers to

14/35

attempt to resolve the domain and should not add anything to its cache. Some DNS servers
may choose to not respect this flag.
Sending queries (whether nonrecursive or recursive) to a DNS server for the purpose of
observing less-than-full TTLs is a measurement technique called DNS cache probing or DNS
cache snooping. The author of the original presentation of DNS cache probing in 2004
framed it as detrimental to security and privacy and proposed that operators of DNS servers,
such as ISPs, should block DNS queries not originating from their own network.
Implementing such a precaution would make it harder for a single observer to directly probe
caches of DNS servers. A 2006 investigation of a botnet C&C server employed DNS cache
probing to investigate prevalence of botnet infections; the authors in that case appear to
have probed DNS servers that were authoritative for some domain, rather than DNS
forwarders.
Even in cases where ISPs block requests to their DNS servers from non-ISP-users, it is
sometimes possible to probe the DNS servers’ caches, by using open DNS forwarders on
the ISP’s network. An open DNS forwarder is a service that accepts queries from any
Internet user, and forwards the query, unmolested, perhaps to an ISP server, which then
responds to the forwarder, which in turn responds to the user. From the perspective of the
ISP’s DNS server, the submitter of the query (the forwarder) is on the ISP’s network. Open
DNS forwarders may be running on improperly configured routers or IoT devices.

Note: Ethics of DNS Cache Probing
In keeping with the growing emphasis on ethics in network measurement research, we
considered the impacts of our technical activities on persons that are not the targets of our
research, and sought to minimize the likelihood of any disruption. Notably we examined the
possibility of costs to users, service disruption, or unwanted warnings from their ISPs. We
believe that this research was conducted in a manner that mitigates these risks, and serves
the public interest.
Firstly, we considered the possibility that users might incur costs or service disruption as a
result of our DNS Cache Probing. We believe that this is a highly unlikely outcome, given the
small number of requests made during the activity. As deployed, the technique results in
fewer than one request per second per IP address, and thus is less than one kilobyte per
second. The total traffic is thus less than 100 megabytes per day. To further minimize load on
the authoritative name servers for the domains that we are probing, we use nonrecursive
queries only. As a result, we do not anticipate costs incurred by users, or bandwidth
degradation.
We determined that it was unlikely that users would receive unwelcome inquiries from their
ISPs, or other authorities, as the result of our DNS cache probing. Certainly, open DNS
forwarders are a major Internet security risk, as they may be employed in DNS amplification
DDoS attacks. Such high-volume attacks might come to the notice of ISPs or other
15/35

authorities and trigger inquiries or sanction by ISPs. DNS Cache Probing, in contrast, is a
very low-volume activity. If an open DNS operator has not already received a contact from
their ISP, we think it very unlikely that this technique will trigger contacts, since it does not
look ‘attack-like.’
At the time of writing, we are unaware of any evidence of DNS Cache Probing used in
malicious real-world attacks. As the technique of DNS Cache Probing continues to be
developed as a research tool, it will be important to ensure that it continues to be used in
ways that do not present privacy and security concerns.

Finding Suitable DNS Forwarders
We first develop a list of suitable DNS forwarders. We run three tests to answer the following
questions:
1. Does the forwarder appear to use resolvers that honour nonrecursive queries?
We send a nonrecursive query for a randomized subdomain of a domain we control
and check if we get a response. The randomized subdomain resolves to an IP but
should not be in any cache. We check each IP twice; if we ever get a correct answer,
then the IP does not honour nonrecursive queries.
2. Which resolvers does the forwarder use? We run a customized nameserver for a
domain we control; the nameserver returns the source IP of an incoming DNS query as
one of the answers in the response. We query each IP 10 times with a recursive query
for a randomized subdomain of the domain we control and collect the set of IPs
returned by our nameserver.
3. Is the forwarder likely to have access to an interesting cache? We query each IP
10 consecutive times with a recursive query for google.com. If an IP returns a response
with an IP in Google’s autonomous system (AS #15169) at least once, then the
forwarder may have access to an interesting cache.
A DNS forwarder is suitable if:
It appears to honour nonrecursive queries.
The forwarder appears to only ever forward requests to resolvers in a single
Autonomous System (AS). We exclude forwarders that use resolvers in multiple ASes
because when such a forwarder shows a DNS cache hit, we do not know in which AS
the DNS cache hit actually occurred.
The (single) AS of the forwarder’s resolvers is designated as “Transit/Access” by
CAIDA’s AS Classification dataset. This helps avoid some cloud providers and shared
DNS providers like Google, OpenDNS, Yandex, CloudFlare, etc.
The AS of the forwarder’s resolvers is not equal to any AS where we found a match for
an NSO Group server.
The forwarder is not itself a resolver; in other words, the forwarder IP does not appear
amongst the resolvers.
16/35

The forwarder is likely to have access to an interesting cache.
Each time we scanned, our list included ~38,000 suitable forwarders, excluding forwarders in
China.

Understanding DNS Cache Probing False Positives
DNS cache probing can produce false positives, i.e., the DNS cache probing technique
reports that the domain is in the cache, when it is in fact not in the cache, or when we caused
it to be in the cache. This can happen in the following three cases:
1. A DNS forwarder does not honor nonrecursive queries all of the time; it may forward
some subset of our queries to a resolver that does not honor nonrecursive queries.
This can result in our query adding the domain to the cache.
2. A DNS forwarder might return the entry that we added to the cache in (1). This can
happen even for DNS forwarders that do honour nonrecursive queries 100% of the
time.
3. Automated processes or curious researchers may observe our DNS cache probing and
send DNS queries for the domain names we are probing; this may add the domain
names to caches we are probing.
We conducted several control experiments to determine how best to exclude false positives.
In our control experiments, we selected 50 domain names with a wildcard record and an
authoritative TTL of at least 300 seconds, then generated a random string to use as a
subdomain, and continuously queried all 50 domains (with the subdomain) on all resolvers
once roughly every 300 seconds in a fixed order, at a rate ensuring each domain was
queried at least once every 300 seconds. We ran the experiment for 24 hours.
Any results we received during the control experiments we treated as false positives. We
developed a set of heuristics to reduce the false positive rate to 0 in these experiments, with
the idea that these same heuristics might help us eliminate many false positives from our
DNS cache probing study of the spyware domains. These are the conditions we applied to
eliminate false positives from our results:
1. Exclude duplicate observations of the same lookup: For each DNS server
response, we check to see if the observation is a duplicate. Specifically, if a response
for a given domain name was preceded by a response (from any DNS forwarder) for
that same domain name n seconds ago, and the TTL of the prior response differed by
n (± 2) from the present response, then we excluded the present response.

17/35

2. Exclude possible duplicate observations even if clocks run at an incorrect rate:
For each ASN, we excluded a record if its TTL was less than or equal to the
immediately prior record for that domain returned by any DNS forwarder for the same
ASN (or IP). We implemented this condition because for some ASNs, we identified
monotonically nondecreasing sequences of TTLs (for domains with large TTLs) that
appeared to correspond with clocks running at incorrect rates, and suspected that
these may have been false positives.
3. Exclude any observation with an improper TTL: We exclude all observations with
TTLs larger than the TTL set by the domain name’s authoritative DNS server
(authoritative TTL), as well as all observations with TTLs within 2 of the authoritative
TTL, as well as all observations with popular fixed TTL values (0, 1, 9, 10, 11, 30, 60,
80, 100, 300, 1000, 10000).
4. Exclude all responses from DNS forwarders that ever return a wrong answer: We
also excluded all responses from a DNS forwarder if it ever returned an incorrect IP
address in a response for the query.
5. Exclude all responses from caches in same country as domain name hosted: For
a given domain name, we excluded all DNS cache responses coming from DNS
forwarders for ASNs in the same country where the domain name was hosted. For
instance, if a domain name pointed to an IP address in Italy, we would exclude all DNS
cache hits from Italy on that domain name as potential false positives.
6. Exclude infrequent responses: Unless resolvers in a given ASN returned at least
four responses for a given domain that were not otherwise excluded, we excluded the
responses for that domain from the ASN.
Our conditions for excluding results were very liberal, and could result in false negatives.
Note that when we say we excluded a response, we mean that the response was not
included as a final result. We continued to consider excluded responses as reasons to
exclude other responses.

Why Is a Domain Name in the Cache?
There are many reasons a domain name may be in a cache (assuming we did not
accidentally put it there). We are only interested in cache entries that might arise from
suspected infections. We briefly introduce our working model of how NSO’s Pegasus
spyware deployments operate, supported by evidence from a staged shutdown of NSO
Group’s infrastructure.
Our mental model of deployment of the Pegasus spyware is that most operators have two
C&C servers to which most infections talk, and that the rest of their infrastructure comprises
domains that are used in exploit links. After reports concerning the use of Pegasus spyware
were published by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab on August 1, 2018, a staged
shutdown of the Pegasus infrastructure was conducted over a period of several days. At first,
the bulk of frontend domains appeared to be shut down, while a handful of final domains

18/35

(usually two) remained active for each operator. We believe that these were the C&C servers
and that the domains were kept online so that infected devices would have an opportunity to
beacon back and receive instructions on new C&C servers with which they should
communicate.
If a given operator had exactly two final domains, we assumed that these were C&C servers.
If an operator had more than two final domains, we assumed that some subset of size 2
were the C&C servers. We did not identify any operator for which our DNS cache probing
technique reported hits on different subsets of size 2 from the final domains. We then filtered
our responses for ASNs which had hits on both hypothesized C&C domains and considered
these to be suspected infections.

The Experiments
Once we had developed our technique for reducing false positives, we DNS cache probed
for all domains we linked to NSO Group’s infrastructure that were active and matching our
fingerprints. We queried domains at least once per their period of authoritative TTL. Because
of the large number of domains and servers, and our desire to conserve bandwidth, we
alternated which domains we were probing. Each domain name was probed for at least three
24-hour periods.

Possible Limitations
Factors such as the use of VPNs and satellite Internet connections may skew our
geolocation results. Thus, the country mapping should serve as a guide for further
investigation, rather than ironclad evidence of monitoring. Additionally, it is possible that
unusual configurations of DNS forwarders (such as the use of consistent hashing to consult
different resolvers for different domain names) could defeat our filtering techniques and
introduce false positives.
We are not sure what percentage of all DNS queries are observable by our method and note
that the percentage could vary greatly across different countries and ISPs. Therefore, it is
possible that our technique has missed a significant number of infections and may have
failed to measure certain countries or ISPs entirely. Importantly, operators that appear in our
results to be operating in a single country may actually be operating in multiple countries. We
did not conduct any DNS cache probing of IPs in Mainland China.

5. Conclusion
This report identifies 45 countries with suspected Pegasus spyware infections operated by at
least 33 likely NSO customers. We determined this by performing DNS cache probing on
domain names we extracted from command and control (C&C) servers matching a newly
devised fingerprint for Pegasus. We grouped the C&C servers, with each group representing

19/35

a single Pegasus operator (assumed to be an NSO customer) using a technique that we call
Athena. The resulting global map of NSO Pegasus infections reveals several issues of
urgent concern.

Known spyware abusers operating Pegasus
While some NSO customers may be using Pegasus spyware as part of ‘lawful’ criminal or
national security investigations investigations, at least six countries with significant Pegasus
operations have a public history of abusing spyware to target civil society.
Three Pegasus operators appear to be operational in Mexico, despite the extensive evidence
of abuses of Pegasus to target Mexican civil society uncovered by Citizen Lab and our
partners in 2017. The findings of widespread targeting in Mexico led to international outcry
and a criminal investigation. However, they do not appear to have resulted in the termination
of all of the Pegasus operations in that country.
In 2016, Citizen Lab exposed the use of Pegasus to target Ahmed Mansoor, a UAE-based
human rights defender. Despite this disclosure and resulting public outcry, it appears that a
suspected UAE-based Pegasus deployment remains operational. Most recently, a Saudi
Arabia-linked campaign appears to be continuing, despite a recent investigation linking it to
the targeting of an Amnesty International staff member and a Saudi activist.
Bahrain, another country that may host a Pegasus operator, has a notorious history of
abusing spyware to target civil society. Notably, the operator linked to Bahrain appears to be
using domain names with political themes, which is highly concerning, given that country’s
history of abuses of surveillance technology. The Togo-linked operator also appears to be
using politically-themed domains. Togo has a history of authoritarian rule and human rights
abuses.

Widespread cross-border surveillance with Pegasus
Ten Pegasus operators appear to be conducting surveillance in multiple countries. While we
have observed prior cases of cross-border targeting, this investigation suggests that crossborder targeting and/or monitoring is a relatively common practice. The scope of this activity
suggests that government-exclusive spyware is widely used to conduct activities that may be
illegal in the countries where the targets are located. For example, we have identified several
possible Pegasus customers not linked to the United States, but with infections in US IP
space. While some of these infections may reflect usage of out-of-country VPN or satellite
Internet service by targets, it is possible that several countries may be actively violating
United States law by penetrating devices located within the US.

Failures at due diligence, contribution to global cyber insecurity

20/35

The cases identified in this report raise serious doubts as to the depth and seriousness of
NSO’s due diligence and concern for human rights protections. They also suggest that the
company has a significant number of customers that maintain active infections in other
countries, likely violating those countries laws. The global market for government exclusive
spyware continues to grow, and as it does, more governments and security services with
histories of abuse will acquire this technology. The expanding user base of spyware like
Pegasus will enable a growing number of authoritarian states to pry into into the digital lives
of their own citizens, but also into phones and computers in pockets and purses around the
globe.

Communications with NSO Group
On 14 September 2018, Citizen Lab Director Ron Deibert sent a letter to two NSO Group
principals, Mr. Omri Lavrie and Mr. Shalev Hulio, notifying them of the details of this report,
explaining that we had shared an embargoed copy with journalists and offering to publish in
full any response they wished to communicate on the record.
On 14 September 2018, Mr. Hulio responded by email saying “we have suggested several
times in the past to meet you and your colleagues, but, unfortunately, our requests have
been ignored.” The Citizen Lab Director and staff have no record of any such outreach.
Moreover, the Citizen Lab does not believe that a private meeting with researchers is a
proper substitute for responsible public communication on such a serious matter of public
interest.
Mr. Hulio also claimed “Contrary to statements made by you, our product is licensed to
government and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of investigating and
preventing crime and terror. Our business is conducted in strict compliance with applicable
export control laws.” Citizen Lab research does not speak to what statements NSO may
make during marketing, sales, or export compliance. However, our research continues to
demonstrate some highly concerning real-world examples of the abuse of NSO Group
technology in practice. These uses have included apparent government customers of NSO
Group abusing Pegasus spyware to target civil society groups, human rights defenders,
lawyers, politicians, and journalists.
On 17 September 2018, we then received a public statement from NSO Group. The
statement mentions that “the list of countries in which NSO is alleged to operate is simply
inaccurate. NSO does not operate in many of the countries listed.” This statement is a
misunderstanding of our investigation: the list in our report is of suspected locations of NSO
infections, it is not a list of suspected NSO customers. As we describe in Section 3, we
observed DNS cache hits from what appear to be 33 distinct operators, some of whom
appeared to be conducting operations in multiple countries. Thus, our list of 45 countries
necessarily includes countries that are not NSO Group customers. We describe additional
limitations of our method in Section 4, including factors such as VPNs and satellite
connections, which can cause targets to appear in other countries.
21/35

The NSO statement also claims the “NSO’s Business Ethics Committee, which includes
outside experts from various disciplines, including law and foreign relations, reviews and
approves each transaction and is authorized to reject agreements or cancel existing
agreements where there is a case of improper use.” We have seen no public details
concerning the membership or deliberations of this committee but encourage NSO Group to
disclose them. NSO’s statements about a Business Ethics Committee recall the example of
Hacking Team’s “outside panel of technical experts and legal advisors … that reviews
potential sales.” This “outside panel” appears to have been a single law firm, whose
recommendations Hacking Team did not always follow.
The continued supply of services to countries with problematic human rights track records
and where highly-publicized abuses of spyware have occurred raise serious doubts about
the effectiveness of this internal mechanism, if it exists at all.
Update
On 18 September 2018, NSO emailed the following addendum to their previous public
statement:
“There are multiple problems with Citizen Lab’s latest report. Most significantly, the list of
countries in which NSO is alleged to sell or where our customers presumably operate the
products is simply inaccurate. NSO does not sell its products in many of the countries listed.
The product is only licensed to operate in countries approved under our Business Ethics
Framework and the product will not operate outside of approved countries. As an example,
the product is specifically designed to not operate in the USA.”
In addition to our DNS cache probing technique showing suspected infections in the United
States, we previously observed a suspected Mexican operator target a minor child in the
United States with Pegasus infection attempts, including messages impersonating the US
embassy. Also, as part of our Million Dollar Dissident report in 2016, we successfully
infected our test phone (in the United States at the time) with a Pegasus link sent to UAE
activist Ahmed Mansoor
