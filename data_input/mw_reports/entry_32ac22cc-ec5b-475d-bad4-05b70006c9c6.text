ProxyShell, QBot, and Conti Ransomware Combined in a
Series of Cyber Attacks
truesec.com/hub/blog/proxyshell-qbot-and-conti-ransomware-combined-in-a-series-of-cyber-attacks

The cybercrime ecosystem continues to evolve. In 2021, we have seen threat actors
generally being faster and spending less dwell time in breached environments. Even as the
growth of the cybercrime industry has led to more specialization among cybercriminals, the
speed and automation have increased. The ransomware industry is now taking on the
appearance of an assembly line.
We are now observing a series of cyber attacks that are all related and end up in an
encryption with the Conti ransomware. This ongoing attack likely involves cooperation
between two or more threat actors, and yet the handover time from one threat actor to
another is only a few hours, and even just minutes in one case.

Attack Overview
First, unpatched Exchange servers are exploited using ProxyShell. Compromised servers
are then used to spread phishing emails delivering Datoploader (aka Squirrelwaffle) and the
QBot trojan. The threat actor here is likely an access broker specializing in selling access to
other cybercriminals.

Attack Overview - Stage 1 - ProxyShell Exploit
Access to infected computers is then handed over to a different group, which then proceeds
to launch Cobalt Strike beacons managed from a different infrastructure. This threat actor is
likely an affiliate of the Conti gang (or "pentester" as they call it) whose job it is to escalate in
the internal network.

In the final stage the Conti gang takes over, deletes backups, and ultimately deploys the
Conti ransomware.

Attack Overview - Stage 3 - Conti Ransomware

ProxyShell and Mass Phishing
ProxyShell is nothing new, but there are still systems that have not been patched in the past
few months.
We have identified multiple cases of Exchange servers compromised with ProxyShell
(chaining CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207) in September and
October.
Starting from early November, the compromised Exchange servers have been used to
launch phishing attacks.
Although the content of the phishing emails looks very suspicious, this attack hijacks existing
email threads and also adjusts the language based on the language appearing in the email
thread. This makes it more likely for a victim to follow the instructions.
An example in English is shown below.

Example of a phishing email in English
The following example is in Swedish, as the hijacked conversation was in Swedish.

Example of a phishing email in Swedish
The links in the emails vary a lot and cannot be used to consistently identify phishing emails
as part of this campaign.
However, we have identified that the following MessageClass property seems to be
consistently used in all phishing emails.

MessageClass property in phishing email messages
We can therefore search for MessageClass:IPM.Blabla in the following logs on the
Exchange server to find likely phishing emails being sent.

Message Tracking logs

Datoploader and QBot Infections
The links in the email direct the victims to websites serving malicious .ZIP files.

5/11

The .ZIP files contain macro-enabled Excel (.XLS) files, as shown below.

Macro enabled Excel file
As in any other classic phishing attack, when opened, the XLS files present an image to the
user, with instructions to enable macro execution.
The XLS macros are obfuscated by building each of the actual command characters from
content of various cells in the document.

Obfuscated macro
When executed, the macros create the directory “C:\Datop”, download three files to this
directory, and run them using regsvr32.exe.

Execution using regsvr32.exe

Persistence
So far we have identified two ways that the malware made itself persistent. An autorun
registry key launching regsvr32.exe to execute a DLL, and a scheduled task launching
PowerShell which in turn starts regsvr32.exe in the same way.

Persistence - Registry Autorun Key

Persistence - Scheduled Task

Cobalt Strike
Within minutes (sometimes hours) from the Datoploader / QBot infection, the threat actor
launched Cobalt Strike. This seems to be a plugin built into Qbot.

Enumeration and Lateral Movement
Shortly after the Cobalt Strike execution, the threat actor starts manually interacting with the
compromised network, first by enumerating and escalating within Active Directory, and later
by deploying Cobalt Strike on additionally compromised servers. Escalation to domain admin
is quickly achieved.
As an additional backdoor into some of the compromised systems, the threat actor creates a
local account named ‘Crackenn’.
The threat actor uses the following command to enumerate workstations in the domain:
$so = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher; $so.filter = \"(&
(samAccountType=805306369))\"; $so.FindAll() | Select -Property @{N='Name'; E=
{$_.properties.samaccountname}},@{N='OS'; E=
{$_.properties.operatingsystem}},@{N='Descr'; E=
{$_.properties.description}},@{N='LastTime'; E={;
[datetime]::FromFileTime($_.properties.lastlogontimestamp -as
[string]).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm')}},@{N='IP'; E=
{$_.properties.ipv4address}},@{N='ManagedBy'; E=
{$_.properties.managedby}},@{N='primarygroup'; E={$_.properties.primarygroup}} |
Export-csv ccccOUT.csv -encoding utf8

Additionally, the following command is used to retrieve all computers within the domain.
import-module activedirectory; Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties * | Sort
OperatingSystem | Select-Object Name, OperatingSystem, ipv4Address, LastLogonDate |
Export-csv some.csv -encoding utf8 -Force
9/11

Once high privileges are obtained, the threat actor uses both Cobalt Strike beacons and
Remote Desktop (RDP) connections to identify sensitive business data to exfiltrate.
The last stage of the attack is the deployment of the Conti ransomware.

What To Do if You Received the Phishing Emails
If users in your organization have received emails like the ones described in this article,
ensure that a thorough analysis is performed on the accounts and computers of the
individuals receiving the emails.
At the very least, check the indicators of compromise below. Consider, however, that files
and domains used in these campaigns constantly change. A consistent indicator so far has
been the presence of the directory “C:\Datop” on computers infected with Datoploader from
the phishing attack.
Keep in mind that if you find indicators of compromise, it is not sufficient to clean/reinstall the
system. It is likely that the compromised system was used to spread to additional computers
in the network. Perform a thorough investigation or ask for help if you don’t have in-house
incident response capabilities.
