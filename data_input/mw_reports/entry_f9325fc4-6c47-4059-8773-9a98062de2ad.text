Russia
UPDATE (May 2022): We have merged UNC2452 with APT29. The UNC2452 activity
described in this post is now attributed to APT29.
As the one-year anniversary of the discovery of the SolarWinds supply chain compromise
passes, Mandiant remains committed to tracking one of the toughest actors we have
encountered. These suspected Russian actors practice top-notch operational security and
advanced tradecraft. However, they are fallible, and we continue to uncover their activity and
learn from their mistakes. Ultimately, they remain an adaptable and evolving threat that must
be closely studied by defenders seeking to stay one step ahead.

Summary
Mandiant continues to track multiple clusters of suspected Russian intrusion activity that
have targeted business and government entities around the globe. Based on our
assessment of these activities, we have identified two distinct clusters of activity, UNC3004
and UNC2652. We associate both groups with UNC2452 also referred to as Nobelium by
Microsoft.
Some of the tactics Mandiant has recently observed include:
Compromise of multiple technology solutions, services, and reseller companies since
2020.
Use of credentials likely obtained from an info-stealer malware campaign by a thirdparty actor to gain initial access to organizations.
Use of accounts with Application Impersonation privileges to harvest sensitive mail
data since Q1 2021.
Use of both residential IP proxy services and newly provisioned geo located
infrastructure to communicate with compromised victims.
Use of novel TTPs to bypass security restrictions within environments including, but not
limited to the extraction of virtual machines to determine internal routing configurations.
Use of a new bespoke downloader we call CEELOADER.
Abuse of multi-factor authentication leveraging “push” notifications on smartphones
In most instances, post compromise activity included theft of data relevant to Russian
interests. In some instances, the data theft appears to be obtained primarily to create new
routes to access other victim environments. The threat actors continue to innovate and
identify new techniques and tradecraft to maintain persistent access to victim environments,
hinder detection, and confuse attribution efforts.
The following sections highlight intrusion activity from multiple incident response efforts that
are currently tracked as multiple uncategorized clusters. Mandiant suspects the multiple
clusters to be attributable to a common Russian threat. The information covers some of the

2/14

tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actors for initial compromise,
establishing a foothold, data collection, and lateral movement; how the threat actors
provision infrastructure; and indicators of compromise. The information is being shared to
raise awareness and allow organizations to better defend themselves.

Initial Compromise
Compromise of Cloud Services Providers
Mandiant has identified multiple instances where the threat actor compromised service
providers and used the privileged access and credentials belonging to these providers to
compromise downstream customers.
In at least one instance, the threat actor identified and compromised a local VPN account
and made use of this VPN account to perform reconnaissance and gain further access to
internal resources within the victim CSP’s environment, which ultimately led to the
compromise of internal domain accounts.
Access Obtained from Info-stealer Malware Campaign
Mandiant identified a campaign where the threat actors gained access to the target
organization’s Microsoft 365 environment using a stolen session token. Mandiant analyzed
the workstations belonging to the end user and discovered that some systems had been
infected with CRYPTBOT, an info-stealer malware, shortly before the stolen session token
was generated. Mandiant observed that in some cases the user downloaded the malware
after browsing to low reputation websites offering free, or “cracked”, software.
Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that the threat actor obtained the session
token from the operators of the info-stealer malware. These tokens were used by the actor
via public VPN providers to authenticate to the target’s Microsoft 365 environment.
Abuse of Repeated MFA Push Notifications
Mandiant has also observed the threat actor executing multiple authentication attempts in
short succession against accounts secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA). In these
cases, the threat actor had a valid username and password combination. Many MFA
providers allow for users to accept a phone app push notification or to receive a phone call
and press a key as a second factor. The threat actor took advantage of this and issued
multiple MFA requests to the end user’s legitimate device until the user accepted the
authentication, allowing the threat actor to eventually gain access to the account.

Post Compromise Activity Via Cloud Solution Provider Compromise
Establish Foothold

3/14

In at least one case, the threat actor compromised a Microsoft Azure AD account within a
Cloud Service Provider’s (CSP) tenant. The account held a specific Azure AD role that
allowed it to use the Admin on Behalf Of (AOBO) feature. With AOBO, users with a specific
role in the CSP tenant have Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Owner access to
Azure subscriptions in their customer’s tenants that were created through the reseller
relationship. RBAC Owner access gives the role holder complete control over all resources
within the Azure subscription. The threat actor leveraged the compromised csp’s credentials
and the AOBO feature to gain privileged access to Azure subscriptions used to host and
manage downstream customer systems. The actor executed commands with NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges within Azure VMs using the Azure Run Command feature.
The Azure Run Command feature allows a user to run PowerShell scripts within an Azure
VM using the Azure Portal, REST API, or PowerShell without knowledge of Windows
credentials that are valid on the VM itself.
Privilege Escalation
Mandiant found evidence that the threat actor used RDP to pivot between systems that had
limited internet access. The threat actor accessed numerous devices using RDP and
executed several native Windows commands. On one device, the threat actors made use of
the Windows Task Manager to dump the process memory belonging to LSASS. The threat
actor also obtained the Azure AD Connect configuration, the associated AD service account,
and the key material used to encrypt the service account credentials. The Azure AD Connect
account is used to replicate the on-premise instance of Active Directory into Azure AD. In
addition to this, the threat actor obtained the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
signing certificate and key material. This allowed the threat actor to forge a SAML token
which could be used to bypass 2FA and conditional access policies to access Microsoft 365.
The actor stopped Sysmon and Splunk logging on these devices and cleared Windows
Event Logs.
The threat actors leveraged compromised privileged accounts and used SMB, remote WMI,
remote scheduled tasks registration, and PowerShell to execute commands within victim
environments. The threat actor used the protocols mainly to perform reconnaissance
(notably using the native command tasklist.exe to inspect remote systems), distribute
BEACON around the network, as well as run native Windows commands for credential
harvesting. In some cases, the actors passed in a specific Kerberos ticket during the WMIC
execution using the /authority:Kerberos flag to authenticate as computer accounts. Computer
accounts by design have local administrator rights over the computer for which they are
named.
Lateral Movement Between CSP and Downstream Clients
CSPs have network filtering layers in place between their on-premises environment and
downstream customer environments as an added security layer. Mandiant identified that the
threat actor used the vSphere PowerCLI and custom PowerShell scripts configured to target
4/14

the vCenter Web endpoint to export the virtual disk image of a specific networking device
and copy it off the service provider’s infrastructure. To authenticate to vCenter the threat
actor used a stolen session cookie for a Privileged Access Management (PAM) account.
Mandiant believes the threat actor was able to analyze this virtual machine and identify
devices within the CSP’s network that were specifically allowed to communicate with
targeted downstream customers.
Using this knowledge, the actor compromised the authorized source jump hosts that
circumvented the network security restrictions of the service provider and downstream victim
network. The actor compromised a customer administration account from one of the
administration jump hosts used for customer administration within the CSP’s environment.
The CSP would connect via these jump hosts using dedicated customer admin accounts to
interact with a downstream customer’s infrastructure. The actor then performed lateral
movement through RDP and the stolen target credentials towards the victim customer
network.
In another case, the threat actor used Azure’s built-in Run Command feature to execute
commands on numerous downstream devices. The threat actor used native Windows tools
to perform initial reconnaissance, credential theft and deploy Cobalt Strike BEACON to
devices via PowerShell.
The actor then used this BEACON implant to persistently install CEELOADER as a
Scheduled Task that ran on login as SYSTEM on specific systems. CEELOADER is
downloader that decrypts a shellcode payload to execute in memory on the victim device.
Data Collection
Mandiant identified multiple attempts by the threat actor to dump the Active Directory
database (ntds.dit) using the built-in ntdsutil.exe command. There was also evidence that the
threat actor used Sysinternals ProcDump to dump the process memory of the LSASS
process. In addition to this, Mandiant discovered that the threat actor had stolen the AD FS
token signing certificate and the DKM key material. This would allow the threat actor to
perform Golden SAML attacks and authenticate as any user into federated environments that
used AD FS for authentication, such as Microsoft 365.
The threat actors performed data theft through several PowerShell commands, uploading
several sequential archive files ending with the .7z extension. The threat actor uploaded
these files to a webserver they presumably controlled.
Mandiant identified binaries that were configured to upload data to the Mega cloud storage
provider. The threat actor deployed the tool in the %TEMP%\d folder as mt.exe and mtt.exe.
Owing to several mistakes made by the threat actor, Mandiant was able to identify that the

5/14

execution of the renamed tool failed. Upon investigation, it appears that the Megatools binary
used by the threat actors fails to execute if renamed. Due to this it is unclear whether the
actor was able to successfully exfiltrate data to Mega using this method.
Mandiant also observed the threat actor access a victim’s on-premises SharePoint server
looking for sensitive technical documentation and credentials. The threat actor then used the
gathered credentials to move laterally around the network.
Application Impersonation
Microsoft Exchange and Exchange Online provide an impersonation role (titled
ApplicationImpersonation) that grants an account the ability to access another account’s
mailbox and “act as” that mailbox owner. Mandiant identified that the threat actor was able to
authenticate to an existing account that was previously granted the ApplicationImpersonation
role; it is unclear how the actor obtained this initial access.
Through this account, Mandiant witnessed the threat actor use impersonation to access
multiple mailboxes belonging to users within the victim organization. The threat actor also
created a new account within the Microsoft 365 environment which Mandiant deems was for
backup access in the event of detection.

Threat Actor Infrastructure
Residential Internet Access
In some campaigns, Mandiant identified that the threat actor was using residential IP
address ranges to authenticate to victim environments. Mandiant believes that this access
was obtained through residential and mobile IP address proxy providers. The providers proxy
traffic through actual mobile devices such as phones and tablets by legitimately bundling a
proxy application in return for free applications and/or services.
The actor used these services to access mailboxes in victim Microsoft 365 tenants. By doing
so, the source logon IP address belongs to a major Internet Service Provider that serves
customers in the same country as the victim environment. These tactics showcase the
complexity of the attacker's operations and is rarely seen executed by other threat actors.
Accomplishing this can make it very difficult for investigators to differentiate between normal
user activity and the threat actor's activity.
Geo-located Azure Infrastructure
In another campaign, the threat actor provisioned a system within Microsoft Azure that was
within close proximity to a legitimate Azure-hosted system belonging to the CSP that they
used to access their customer’s environment. This allowed the actor to establish geoproximity with the victims which resulted in the recorded source IP address for the activity
originating from within legitimate Azure IP ranges. Similar to the technique of using
6/14

residential IP addresses, using Azure infrastructure within close proximity to victim networks
makes it difficult for investigators to differentiate between normal user activity and the threat
actor’s activity.
Compromised WordPress Sites Hosting Second Stage Payloads
In several campaigns by the actor, Mandiant and our partners identified that the actor was
hosting second stage payloads as encrypted blobs on legitimate websites running
WordPress. Mandiant observed at least two separate malware families attributed to the
threat actor hosted on compromised WordPress sites.
TOR, VPS and VPN Providers
In multiple campaigns by the threat actor, Mandiant witnessed the actor use a mixture of
TOR, Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and public Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to access
victim environments. In a particular campaign, Mandiant identified that the threat actor
performed initial reconnaissance via a VPS provider located in the same region as the victim.
Mandiant believes a misconfiguration by the threat actor meant that the VPN services
running on the VPS stopped functioning after 8 hours. Mandiant was then able to identify
numerous TOR exit nodes that the threat actor used based on new authentication events.

Operational Security and Planning
Mandiant identified attempts to compromise multiple accounts within an environment and
kept use of each account separated by function. This reduced the likelihood that detecting
one activity could expose the entire scope of the intrusion. Mandiant found evidence that the
actor compromised multiple accounts and used one for the sole purpose of reconnaissance,
while the others were reserved for lateral movement within the organization. Mandiant
previously observed this threat actor using strict operational security to use specific accounts
and systems in victim environments for activities that are often higher risk, such as data theft
and large-scale reconnaissance.
Once within an environment, the threat actor was able to quickly pivot to on-premises
servers and crawl these servers for technical documentation and credentials. From this
documentation, the actor was able to identify a route to gain access to their ultimate target’s
network. This reconnaissance shows that the threat actor had a clear end goal in mind and
were able to identify and exploit an opportunity to obtain required intelligence to further their
goals.
Mandiant also observed efforts to avoid detection by circumventing or deleting system
logging within the victim’s environment. Namely, Mandiant identified the threat actor disabling
SysInternals Sysmon and Splunk Forwarders on victim machines that they accessed via
Microsoft Remote Desktop in addition to clearing Windows Event Logs.

Malware Descriptions
Cobalt Strike BEACON: Backdoor written in C/C++ that is part of the Cobalt Strike
framework. Supported backdoor commands include shell command execution, file transfer,
file execution, and file management. BEACON can also capture keystrokes and screenshots
as well as act as a proxy server. BEACON may also be tasked with harvesting system
credentials, port scanning, and enumerating systems on a network. BEACON communicates
with a command and control (C2) server via HTTP(S) or DNS.
CEELOADER: Downloader written in C programing language. It supports shellcode
payloads that are executed in memory. An obfuscation tool has been used to hide the code
in CEELOADER in between large blocks of junk code with meaningless calls to the Windows
API. The meaningful calls to the Windows API are hidden within obfuscated wrapper
functions that decrypt the name of the API and dynamically resolve it before calling.
CEELOADER communicates via HTTP and the C2 response is decrypted using AES-256 in
CBC mode. Additionally, the HTTP request contains a statically defined id that may vary from
sample to sample. CEELOADER does not contain a persistence mechanism.

Attribution
Mandiant assesses that some of this activity is UNC2652, a cluster of activity observed
targeting diplomatic entities with phishing emails containing HTML attachments with
malicious JavaScript, ultimately dropping a BEACON launcher.
Mandiant also assesses that some of this activity is UNC3004, a cluster of activity observed
targeting both government and business entities through gaining access to Cloud Solution
Providers/Managed Service Providers to gain access to downstream customers.
Microsoft has previously reported on both UNC2652 and UNC3004 activity and links it to
UNC2452, the group behind the SolarWinds compromise, under the name “Nobelium”. While
it is plausible that they are the same group, currently, Mandiant does not have enough
evidence to make this determination with high confidence.

Outlook and Implications
This intrusion activity reflects a well-resourced threat actor set operating with a high level of
concern for operational security. The abuse of a third party, in this case a CSP, can facilitate
access to a wide scope of potential victims through a single compromise. Though Mandiant
cannot currently attribute this activity with higher confidence, the operational security
associated with this intrusion and exploitation of a third party is consistent with the tactics
employed by the actors behind the SolarWinds compromise and highlights the effectiveness
of leveraging third parties and trusted vendor relationships to carry out nefarious operations.
