Who Wrote the ALPHV/BlackCat Ransomware Strain?
krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/who-wrote-the-alphv-blackcat-ransomware-strain/

In December 2021, researchers discovered a new ransomware-as-a-service named ALPHV
(a.k.a. “BlackCat“), considered to be the first professional cybercrime group to create and
use a ransomware strain written in the Rust programming language. In this post, we’ll
explore some of the clues left behind by a developer who was reputedly hired to code the
ransomware variant.

According to an analysis released this week by Varonis, ALPHV is actively recruiting
operators from several ransomware organizations — including REvil, BlackMatter and
DarkSide — and is offering affiliates up to 90 percent of any ransom paid by a victim
organization.
“The group’s leak site, active since early December 2021, has named over twenty victim
organizations as of late January 2022, though the total number of victims, including those
that have paid a ransom to avoid exposure, is likely greater,” Varonis’s Jason Hill wrote.
One concern about more malware shifting to Rust is that it is considered a much more
secure programming language compared to C and C++, writes Catalin Cimpanu for The
Record. The upshot? Security defenders are constantly looking for coding weaknesses in
many ransomware strains, and if more start moving to Rust it could become more difficult to
find those soft spots.

Researchers at Recorded Future say they believe the ALPHV/BlackCat author was
previously involved with the infamous REvil ransomware cartel in some capacity. Earlier this
month the Russian government announced that at the United States’ request it arrested 14
individuals in Russia thought to be REvil operators.
Still, REvil rolls on despite these actions, according to Paul Roberts at ReversingLabs. “The
recent arrests have NOT led to a noticeable change in detections of REvil malicious files,”
Roberts wrote. “In fact, detections of files and other software modules associated with the
REvil ransomware increased modestly in the week following the arrests by Russia’s FSB
intelligence service.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has a standing $10 million reward for information
leading to the identification or location of any individuals holding key leadership positions in
REvil.

WHO IS BINRS?
A confidential source recently had a private conversation with a support representative who
fields questions and inquiries on several cybercrime forums on behalf of a large and popular
ransomware affiliate program. The affiliate rep confirmed that a coder for ALPHV was known
by the handle “Binrs” on multiple Russian-language forums.
On the cybercrime forum RAMP, the user Binrs says they are a Rust developer who’s been
coding for 6 years. “My stack is Rust, nodejs, php, golang,” Binrs said in an introductory post,
in which they claim to be fluent in English. Binrs then signs the post with their identification
number for ToX, a peer-to-peer instant messaging service.
That same ToX ID was claimed by a user called “smiseo” on the Russian forum BHF, in
which smiseo advertises “clipper” malware written in Rust that swaps in the attacker’s bitcoin
address when the victim copies a cryptocurrency address to their computer’s temporary
clipboard.
The nickname “YBCat” advertised that same ToX ID on Carder[.]uk, where this user claimed
ownership over the Telegram account @CookieDays, and said they could be hired to do
software and bot development “of any level of complexity.” YBCat mostly sold “installs,”
offering paying customers to ability to load malware of their choice on thousands of hacked
computers simultaneously.
There is also an active user named Binrs on the Russian crime forum wwh-club[.]co who
says they’re a Rust coder who can be reached at the @CookieDays Telegram account.
On the Russian forum Lolzteam, a member with the username “DuckerMan” uses the
@CookieDays Telegram account in his signature. In one thread, DuckerMan promotes an
affiliate program called CookieDays that lets people make money by getting others to install

cryptomining programs that are infected with malware. In another thread, DuckerMan is
selling a different clipboard hijacking program called Chloe Clipper.

The CookieDays moneymaking program.

According to threat intelligence firm Flashpoint, the Telegram user DuckerMan employed
another alias — Sergey Duck. These accounts were most active in the Telegram channels
“Bank Accounts Selling,” “Malware developers community,” and “Raidforums,” a popular
English-language cybercrime forum.

I AM DUCKERMAN
The GitHub account for a Sergey DuckerMan lists dozens of code repositories this user has
posted online over the years. The majority of these projects were written in Rust, and the rest
in PHP, Golang and Nodejs — the same coding languages specified by Binrs on RAMP. The
Sergey DuckerMan GitHub account also says it is associated with the “DuckerMan” account
on Telegram.

Sergey DuckerMan’s GitHub profile.

Sergey DuckerMan has left many accolades for other programmers on GitHub — 460 to be
exact. In June 2020, for example, DuckerMan gave a star to a proof-of-concept ransomware
strain written in Rust.
Sergey DuckerMan’s Github profile says their social media account at Vkontakte (Russian
version of Facebook/Meta) is vk.com/duckermanit. That profile is restricted to friends-only,
but states that it belongs to a Sergey Pechnikov from Shuya, Russia.
A look at the Duckermanit VKontakte profile in Archive.org shows that until recently it bore a
different name: Sergey Kryakov. The current profile image on the Pechnikov account shows
a young man standing closely next to a young woman.
KrebsOnSecurity reached out to Pechnikov in transliterated Russian via the instant message
feature built into VKontakte.

“I’ve heard about ALPHV,” Pechnikov replied in English. “It sounds really cool and I’m glad
that Rust becomes more and more popular, even in malware sphere. But I don’t have any
connections with ransomware at all.”
I began explaining the clues that led to his VK account, and how a key cybercriminal actor in
the ransomware space had confirmed that Binrs was a core developer for the ALPHV
ransomware.
“Binrs isn’t even a programmer,” Pechnikov interjected. “He/she can’t be a DuckerMan. I am
DuckerMan.”
BK: Right. Well, according to Flashpoint, the Telegram user DuckerMan also used the alias
Sergey Duck.
Sergey: Yep, that’s me.
BK: So you can see already how I arrived at your profile?
Sergey: Yep, you’re a really good investigator.
BK: I noticed this profile used to have a different name attached to it. A ‘Sergey Kryakov.’
Sergey: It was my old surname. But I hated it so much I changed it.
BK: What did you mean Binrs isn’t even a programmer?
Sergey: I haven’t found any [of] his accounts on sites like GitHub/stack overflow. I’m not
sure, does binrs sell Rust Clipper?
BK: So you know his work! I take it that despite all of this, you maintain you are not involved
in coding malware?
Sergey: Well, no, but I have some “connections” with these guys. Speaking about Binrs, I’ve
been researching his personality since October too.
BK: Interesting. What made you want to research his personality? Also, please help me
understand what you mean by “connections.”
Sergey: I think he is actually a group of some people. I’ve written him on telegram from
different accounts, and his way of speaking is different. Maybe some of them somehow tied
with ALPHV. But on forums (I’ve checked only XSS and Exploit) his ways of speaking are the
same.
BK: …..
Sergey: I don’t know how to explain this. By the way, binrs now is really silent, I think he’s
lying low. Well, this is all I know.

No doubt he is. I enjoyed speaking with Sergey, but I also had difficulty believing most of
what he said. Also, I was bothered that Sergey hadn’t exactly disputed the logic behind the
clues that led to his VK account. In fact, he’d stated several times that he was impressed
with the investigation.
In many previous Breadcrumbs stories, it is common at this point for the interviewee to claim
they were being set up or framed. But Sergey never even floated the idea.
I asked Sergey what might explain all these connections if he wasn’t somehow involved in
coding malicious software. His answer, our final exchange, was again equivocal.
“Well, all I have is code on my github,” he replied. “So it can be used [by] anyone, but I don’t
think my projects suit for malwares.”
Update, Jan 29, 4:26 p.m. ET: Sergey Duckerman has deleted their GitHub account.
Meanwhile, the user Binrs has been (preemptively?) banning their profile from multiple
cybercrime forums where they were previously active.
