Mustang Panda continue targeting countries across Europe and Asia Pacific, utilizing current
geopolitical events to their advantage. Their attack chain remains consistent, with the continued use
of archive files, shortcut files, malicious loaders, and the use of PlugX malware. Based on the lure
covered in this blog, the goal of this particular operation appears to be collecting sensitive
information from European countries and states from Asia, which might be supporting Western
countries.

Summary
As part of ongoing hunting and continuous monitoring efforts regarding the advanced persistent
threat (APT) group Mustang Panda, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team recently
came across an interesting RAR file titled “Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards
Russia.rar”.
This file captured our interest due to the ongoing geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe. An
examination of its contents revealed a decoy document matching the naming convention of the RAR,
along with additional components that are often seen as part of a typical PlugX infection chain.
By delving into the associated network infrastructure and pivoting off related network artifacts,
additional files and infrastructure were uncovered. These conformed to similar Tactics, Techniques,
and Procedures (TTPs) and appeared to be part of a larger campaign from this same threat actor
targeting multiple entities, both Government and Private, in several industries and throughout many
countries across the world. In this report, we document what we found.

Technical Analysis
Context
Mustang Panda, also known as HoneyMyte, Bronze President or Red Delta, is one of the more active
APT groups in operation on the threat landscape today, with a wide variety of campaigns documented
as far back as 2012. It is publicly attributed to China-based cyberespionage threat actors.
It is continually honing its capabilities, but its core approach remains consistent, with the use of
themed lures related to current events. These contain decoy documents and legitimate applications
that are susceptible to DLL search order hijacking.
This is exploited to coerce targets into executing a malicious loader to deliver a PlugX payload. The
RAR archive – “Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards Russia.rar" – aligned with
numerous TTPs related to Mustang Panda that have previously been documented by both BlackBerry
and other vendors.

Mustang Panda Attack Vector
A RAR file is an archive that contains one or more files compressed with RAR compression. As seen in
recent campaigns, the use of archives is a common infection vector for Mustang Panda. The political
theme of the RAR file is a tactic employed by the threat actor to coerce targets into opening the file.
Once the archive is open, the victim will see a directory called “_” and a shortcut file named with the
same politically themed lure.
The .LNK file uses a double file extension in an attempt to disguise the shortcut file as a document in
the hope the target would open it, in the process executing the shortcut file. This utilization of double
extensions has been used by Mustang Panda in the past as a way to convince users to execute the
shortcut file.
The shortcut file contains a command that kicks off the initial execution of the attack chain:
“C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c "_\___\_\___\______\_____\__\test11.bpu||(forfiles /^P
%USERPROFILE%\ /S /^M "Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards Russia.rar" /C
"cmd /c (c:\progra~1\7-Zip\7z x -y -aoa @path||c:\progra~2\7-Zip\7z x -y -aoa @path”

The LNK file looks to execute “test11.bpu”, which is a legitimate portable executable (PE) file called
“ClassicExplorerSettings.exe” belonging to Classic Shell, which is a freeware utility used to customize
the look of the Windows® system.

Weaponization
The Mustang Panda attack chain is reliant on the DLL sideloading technique previously used in their
campaign targeting Myanmar, where the threat actor plants both a legitimate executable and a
payload alongside each other, a technique which is designed to take advantage of the search order of a

program as soon as the legitimate application has been invoked. Once the shortcut file is executed, the
legitimate application will be launched and the malicious DLL loader will also get invoked.
“ClassicExplorer32.dll” is planted in the same directory as “test11.bpu” to abuse the search order once
the executable is invoked. The purpose of the DLL is to load the “ClassicExplorerLog.dat” file and
execute the shellcode within it. Interestingly, the loader used seems to have a subtle change in how the
shellcode is decrypted and executed.
Mustang Panda DLL loaders reported by Secureworks back in September were utilizing the
EnumThreadWindows API to pass execution to the start of the malicious payload file. In these more
recent samples, the DLL loader uses the EnumSystemCodePagesW API to execute the shellcode
similarly. A pointer to the already decrypted shellcode is passed to EnumSystemCodePagesW API as
an application-defined callback function, as seen in Figure 3 below. The use of the
EnumSystemCodePagesW API was mentioned in a Twitter thread by kienbigmummy and also seen in
a Black Hat Asia presentation. The purpose of the shellcode is to decrypt and execute the final
malicious payload – PlugX – in memory.

Once the PlugX payload has been decrypted and execution is passed to the payload, we can see the
config also get decrypted into memory. Here we can see the IP address 5[.]34[.]178[.]156, the
campaign ID of “test222”, as well as the name of the decoy document that gets displayed to the victim.

Additional Linked Infrastructure
Pivoting on the certificate showed 15 other IP addresses utilizing the same SSL certificate. Five of
these were being used as C2 servers for the same attack chain delivering lures/decoys in the form of
RAR files, in the hopes of the victims executing PlugX malware in memory.
The lures all varied but all aligned with the previous campaigns associated with Mustang Panda.

Mustang Panda Uses the Russian-Ukrainian War to Attack Europe and Asia Pacific Targets

Targets
Mustang Panda’s previous targets have included Government and Non-Government Organizations
(NGO) in many locations around the world, from various states in Southeast Asia, to the European
Union, to the U.S. and beyond. Considering the decoy lures found, as well as the correlating network
telemetry, we found the threat actor to be targeting areas in Europe as well as Asia-Pacific, specifically
Vietnam. This is not an exhaustive list as we have been unable to identify the industries of all the
victims thus far.

Figure 8: Partial list of victims

Conclusions
Mustang Panda continues to utilize well-thought-out lures related to current events to deliver the
PlugX malware that the group is synonymous with. While Mustang Panda has stayed within their
typical TTPs with PlugX, including custom lures, double extensions, and infrastructure re-use, they do
make subtle changes along the way in the hope of evading detection. The historical data associated
with the pivoted SSL certificate shows it being first seen on 2022-02-27. It is still being actively used
at the time of writing.
Mustang Panda has a history of targeting many different entities across the globe, but their target
aligns with the interests of the Chinese government. From the associated lures, NetFlow data, and
other characteristics, the EU and APAC have been their biggest targets as of late.
