Games are over: Winnti is now targeting pharmaceutical companies
For a long time the Winnti group had been considered as a Chinese threat actor targeting gaming
companies specifically. Recently, we’ve seen information indicating that the scope of targets can be wider
and is no longer limited to the entertainment business. We actually track samples of Winnti malware all
the time, but so far we haven’t been able to catch one with solid clues indicating other targeted industries.
Also our visibility as a vendor does not cover every company in the world (at least so far ;)) and the
Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) did not reveal other attacks except those against gaming companies.
Well, sometimes targeted entities have included telecommunication companies, or better, large holdings,
but it seems that at least one of their businesses was in some way related to the production or distribution
of computer games.
In April Novetta released its excellent report on the Winnti malware spotted in the operations of Axiom
group. The Axiom group has been presented as an advanced Chinese threat actor carrying out cyberespionage attacks against a whole range of different industries. For us, the Novetta report was another
source of intelligence that Winnti was already expanding beyond online games. One of the recent Winnti
samples we found appears to confirm this as well.
The new sample belongs to one of the Winnti versions described in Novetta’s report – Winnti 3.0. This is
one of the Dynamic Link Libraries composing this RAT (Remote Access Trojan) platform – the worker
library (which in essence is the RAT DLL) with the internal name w64.dll and the exported functions
work_end and work_start. Since, as usual, this component is stored on the disk with the strings and
much of other data in the PE header removed/zeroed, it is impossible to restore the compilation date of
this DLL. But this library includes two drivers compiled on August 22 and September 4, 2014. The sample
has an encrypted configuration block placed in overlay. This block may include a tag for the sample –
usually it is a campaign ID or victim ID/name. This time the operators put such tag in the configuration
and it turned out to be the name of the well-known global pharmaceutical company
headquartered in Europe:

Pic.1 Configuration block
Besides the sample tag, the configuration block includes the names of other files involved in the working

of the RAT platform and the service name (Adobe Service), after which malware is installed. The presence
of the following files could indicate that the system has been compromised:
C:\Windows\TEMP\tmpCCD.tmp
ServiceAdobe.dll
ksadobe.dat
One of the mentioned drivers (a known, malicious Winnti network rootkit) was signed with a stolen
certificate of a division of a huge Japanese conglomerate. Although this division is involved in
microelectronics manufacturing, other business directions of the conglomerate include development
and production of drugs as well as medical equipment.
Although the nature of the involvement of Winnti operators, who were earlier perceived to be a threat only
to the online gaming industry, in the activities of other cyber-espionage teams still remains rather
obscure, the evidence is there. From now on, when you see Winnti mentioned, don’t think just about
gaming companies; consider also at least targeted telecoms and big pharma companies.
