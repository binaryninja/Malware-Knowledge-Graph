Attribution
• Similar but different with another APT group “BlueMashroom”
• same region
• different ways of Execution & Persistence
• hijacking shortcut file in startup paths
• use regsvr32 to execute DLL

Conclusion

• APT actors not always advanced, PoisonVine find its ways to
improve efficient.
• APT actors always considered reduce its signature in investigate
and hide the attribution.
• In the APT tracing process, finding intent of threat and attribution
can always be an interesting game.

Thank you!
