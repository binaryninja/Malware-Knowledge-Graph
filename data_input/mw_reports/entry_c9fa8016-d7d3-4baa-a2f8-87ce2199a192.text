A new ransomware has been discovered called FuxSocy that borrows much of its behavior
from the notorious and now-defunct Cerber Ransomware.
Discovered by MalwareHunterTeam, this ransomware calls itself FuxSocy Encryptor, which
is named after the FSociety hacking group in the Mr. Robot television series.
Like any other ransomware, FuxSocy will encrypt a victim's files and then demand a ransom
in order to get a decryptor.
What is interesting about this ransomware, though, is that the developers decided to model
it after the Cerber Ransomware by adopting its outward appearance as well as some of the
internals.

Similarities to Cerber
When analyzed by reverse engineer Vitali Kremez, the researcher told BleepingComputer
he noticed that some of the ransomware internals are similar to those used by Cerber.

For example, when encrypting files FuxSocy will skip files whose file path contain certain
strings. Many of the strings are taken directly from Cerber, who used the same exception
list, with FuxSocy adding some additional ones.
The full list of bypassed folders are below:
*:\$getcurrent\*
*:\$recycle.bin\*
*:\$windows.~bt\*
*:\$windows.~ws\*
*:\boot\*
*:\documents and settings\all users\*
*:\documents and settings\default user\*
*:\documents and settings\localservice\*
*:\documents and settings\networkservice\*
*:\intel\*
*:\msocache\*
*:\perflogs\*
*:\program files (x86)\*
*:\program files\*
*:\programdata\*
*:\recovery\*
*:\recycled\*
*:\recycler\*
*:\system volume information\*
*:\temp\*
*:\tmp\*
*:\windows.old\*
*:\windows10upgrade\*
*:\windows\*
*:\winnt\*
*:\.*\*
*\appdata\local\*
*\appdata\locallow\*
*\appdata\roaming\*
*\local settings\*
*\public\music\sample music\*
*\public\pictures\sample pictures\*
*\public\videos\sample videos\*
*\tor browser\*

Like Cerber, FuxSocy will also prioritize certain folders to make sure they get encrypted.
This list of priority folders are:

bitcoin
excel
microsoft sql server
microsoft\excel
microsoft\microsoft sql server
microsoft\office
microsoft\onenote
microsoft\outlook
microsoft\powerpoint
microsoft\word
office
onenote
outlook
powerpoint
steam
the bat!
thunderbird
word
autodesk
solidworks*
OpenSCAD

In addition, FuxSocy also scrambles the file name and extensions used by encrypted files in
a similar manner as Cerber.

Encrypted FuxSocy Files
Finally, after encrypting a computer the Windows desktop background will be changed to an
almost identical background that was originally used by Cerber.

So what has changed?
While outwardly FuxSocy looks very similar to Cerber, there are also quite a few
differences.
For example, FuxSocy attempts to more extensively block users from running the
ransomware on a virtual machine by looking for the following processes, files, and named
pipes:

prl_tools.exe

system32\VBoxControl.exe
system32\drivers\vmmouse.sys
system32\drivers\vmhgfs.sys

system32\drivers\vmci.sys
system32\drivers\vmmemctl.sys
system32\drivers\vmrawdsk.sys
system32\drivers\vmusbmouse.sys

Another strange feature is that the FuxSocy Encryptor does not encrypt the entire file.
According to Michael Gillespie, the ransomware will start encrypting files at 0x708 bytes,
which for the most part will make documents unusable.

Some image files, though, will have their unencryption regions viewable as shown below,
with the rest being corrupted.

Finally the ransom notes are different, with Cerber using a Tor payment site, while FuxSocy
asks you to contact them via the ToxChat messaging app.

While the similarities and differences are interesting, ultimately both ransomware infections
do the same thing. They encrypt your data and make you pay a ransom to get your files
back.
Unfortunately, at this time preliminary research of this ransomware indicates that the
ransomware cannot be decrypted for free. It is advised that any victims restore their files
backup rather than paying the ransom.
Update 10/28/19: Made a correction that some of the folders we stated were bypassed are
actualy given prioritized encryption.

Ain't the Corrupted Image File a image from DirtyDecrypt?
