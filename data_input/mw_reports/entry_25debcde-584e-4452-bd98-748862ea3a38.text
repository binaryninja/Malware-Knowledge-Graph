The curious case of 0xFancyFilter

The Work of Cyber in
the
Age of Mechanical Reproduction
This talk covers the interesting case of ‘0xFancyFilter’, an amalgam between what could be
referred to as Regin 1.5 and Equation Group’s MISTYVEAL. This rare piece of malware is
the only documented instance of code overlap between the Regin and Equation Group
frameworks and is used to illustrate the difference between stating a relationship between
threat actors from public documents vs. being able to show that relationship based on
technical findings. The rare –but not at all surprising– collaboration is dubbed the Voltron
Supra Threat Actor (STA) as suggested early on by a friendly researcher.
