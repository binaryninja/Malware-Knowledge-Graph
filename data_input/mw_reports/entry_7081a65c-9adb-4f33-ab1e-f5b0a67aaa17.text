Unraveling the Long Thread of the Sony Pictures Attack
INTRODUCTION
The 2014 Sony Pictures hack was one of the most shocking and significant cyber attacks
against a U.S. commercial enterprise to date. The incident caused significant financial and
reputational damage to Sony Pictures and its executives. Most importantly, it illustrated
how little resistance a corporate enterprise is able to provide in the face of a capable and
determined adversary with destructive intent.
In Operation Blockbuster, a Novetta-led coalition, comprised of the Novetta Threat Research
& Interdiction Group (NTRIG) and private industry partners, identified and interdicted the
adversary behind the Sony Pictures attack. The coalition links this adversary – dubbed “the
Lazarus Group” – to the repeated use of particular malware code and numerous malicious
attacks against commercial, military and government targets, dating as far back as 2009.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
}} Malware used in the November 2014 Sony Pictures attack is definitively linked to malware
developed as early as 2009.

}} The same malware has been used to target government, media, military, aerospace,
financial, and critical infrastructure entities, primarily in South Korea and the United States.
}} The depth and scope of evidence suggests that the Sony Pictures attack was carried out
by a well-structured, well-resourced and highly motivated organization, and not the work
of a pop-up hacktivist group.

}} Novetta’s coordinated, ongoing response illustrates that in this new era of cyber defense,
private industry’s role has changed from “observe and report” to “observe and act.”

Novetta released
signatures to disrupt
the Lazarus Group's attacks

In the weeks following the Sony Pictures hack, US-CERT released an alert detailing a
set of malware families used by unidentified attackers to compromise large network
infrastructures and deploy hard-drive wiping malware, RATs, and proxy trojans.
Novetta’s analysis of the base set of malware revealed that common code libraries were
used across multiple malware families. The Operation Blockbuster team used these libraries
to generate signatures to detect additional malware samples, including more than 45
distinct malware families that fall under the Lazarus Group’s domain.
Novetta, with the help of operation partners, made available signatures that identified
Lazarus Group tools on a broad scale, effectively disrupting the group’s ability to use
these tools for malicious intent.

ACRONYM KEY:
US-CER T:

United States Computer Emergency
Readiness Team

R AT:

“Remote access trojan,” a malware that includes
backdoor access for control over a targeted computer

INDUSTRY’S
NEW ROLE

BUSINESS
IMPLICATIONS

In Operation Blockbuster, Novetta identified the specific attack
tools of a well-connected, globally significant attack group. Novetta
and industry partners worked together to understand and devise
ways to degrade the malware toolset, eroding the group’s ability
to use these tools for further harm. The industry team shared
information and took decisive action to protect collective customers.

The Sony Pictures attack, and the long thread of related attacks documented
in Operation Blockbuster, demonstrates that commercial enterprises are
already living in a new era of cyber threats. As corporations’ cyber footprints
continue to grow, security operations are often unable to scale. Malicious
threat actors like the Lazarus Group remain a step ahead. The urgency
for building and maintaining a robust and evolving cybersecurity practice
has never been greater. As an executive, you know it’s your responsibility
to maintain the integrity and security of your brand, and your customers’
data. Learn how to better protect your enterprise. Download Operation
Blockbuster to read the full story and remediation suggestions.

This sets a precedent for industry’s new role in the changing
dynamic of cyber defense. Industry is no longer only a watchdog.
As the work behind Operation Blockbuster continues, Novetta
demonstrates that elite security professionals with the right skills
and talents, working collaboratively, can and should take decisive
action not only to protect against attacks, but to fight back against
attackers. These industry teams can provide customers with
additional protection while educating the general public about
modern cyber threats.
