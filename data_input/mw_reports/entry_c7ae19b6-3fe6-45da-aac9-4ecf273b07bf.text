Modularity
The modularity and expandability of this RAT are what it's been built on. That's how it
manages to stay very compact, light-weight and fast. You can download other utilities like
password recovery or keylogging tools via Powershell scripts (link to some useful scripts will
follow soon) and then execute them as if they were running on your own machine.
Afterwards you're able to upload the results (also with a ps script) or evaluate them on the
spot (via the type command) in cmd.

General Description
At the core of this RAT lies it's unique ability to remotely execute commands via CMD,
Powershell and almost all console-based applications. It has the capabilities to automatically
install on startup and clean up behind itself. It also features an error-handler that logs any
issues. As of now, it is not 100% stable. Under 'normal' conditions it runs smoothly and
without any disturbances, but severe irregularities in input (i.e. messing around with it a lot)
may cause crashes. This will be resolved in the near future.
