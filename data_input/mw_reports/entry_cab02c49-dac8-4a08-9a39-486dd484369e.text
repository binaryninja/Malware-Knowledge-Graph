A family of ransomware Trojans that encrypts files and adds the extensions “.xtbl” and “.ytbl”
emerged in late 2014/early 2015, and quickly established itself among the top three most
widespread encryptors in Russia (along with Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Cryakl and TrojanRansom.BAT.Scatter). This threat has been assigned the verdict TrojanRansom.Win32.Shade according to Kaspersky Lab’s classification. The original name given
to the encryptor by its creator is not known; other security vendors detect it as
Trojan.Encoder.858, Ransom:Win32/Troldesh.
There has been no appreciable evolution of this Trojan over time – only the format of the
encrypted file’s name, the C&C server addresses and the RSA keys have been changing.

1/12

There are two main methods used to deliver the malware to victims’ computers: spam
messages and exploit kits (in particular, NuclearEK).
When delivered via spam, the user receives a letter with a malicious file attached. The
system is infected when the user attempts to open the attachment. The following file names
have been used when spreading Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Shade:
doc_dlea podpisi.com
doc_dlea podpisi.rar
documenti_589965465_documenti.com
documenti_589965465_documenti.rar
documenti_589965465_doc.scr
doc_dlea podpisi.rar
неподтвержден 308853.scr
documenti dlea podpisi 05.08.2015.scr.exe
akt sverki za 17082015.scr
It should be noted that the file name changes for each mass mailing campaign, so the
potential file names are not limited to those listed above.
The second delivery mechanism – via exploit kit – is more dangerous because the infection
occurs when the victim unwittingly visits a compromised website. It may be a site belonging
to cybercriminals, or a legitimate resource that has been hacked. In most cases, the user is
completely unaware of the danger the website poses. Malicious code on the website exploits
a vulnerability in the browser or a plugin, and the Trojan is then covertly installed in the
system. Unlike the spam delivery method, the victim doesn’t even have to run an executable
file.
After Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Shade ends up in the system, it connects to a C&C server
located in the Tor network, reports the infection and requests a public RSA-3072 key that is
subsequently used to encrypt files (as discussed below). Should the connection attempt fail,
the Trojan chooses one of the 100 public keys that are stored within its body for just such an
eventuality.
The Trojan then starts encrypting files. While scanning for objects to encrypt, it uses the
static list of extensions shown in the screenshot below.

When encryption is complete, a menacing image is set as the desktop background:

The Trojan leaves ransom demands in the files README1.txt, …, README10.txt. The
contents of these files are always the same:

However, unlike most other encryptors, Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Shade doesn’t stop there. It
doesn’t terminate its process, but instead starts an infinite loop in which it requests a list from
the C&C server containing the URLs of additional malware. It then downloads that malware
and installs it in the system. This sort of activity is typical of download bots. We have spotted
malware from the following families being downloaded:
Trojan.Win32.CMSBrute (a more detailed description is provided below).
Trojan.Win32.Muref
Trojan.Win32.Kovter
Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Zemot
Below is the code for the download and listening loop:

It is therefore very important to run a complete anti-malware scan of the computer if the
Shade encryptor (or the .xtbl, .ytbl files it creates) is detected. If left untreated, the system will
most probably remain infected with several malicious programs downloaded by the
encryptor.

Common features of Shade family Trojans
4/12

Written in C++ using STL and its own classes.
Statically linked with Tor client.
Uses boost (threads), curl, OpenSSL libraries.
Each sample has the URL of a C&C server hardcoded in it. A total of 10 C&C server
addresses were identified in various samples, eight of which are currently active. All the
C&C servers are located in the Tor network.
All strings (including the names of imported functions) are AES encrypted. They are
decrypted when the program starts, then the import table is dynamically populated.
Prior to setting the new desktop background, the old one is saved in the registry.
Typically packed with UPX and an extra packer. Once unpacked, it is 1817 KB in size.
Creates 10 identical files named README1.txt, …README10.txt on the victim
computer, containing ransom demands in Russian and English.
A unique 256-bit AES key is generated to encrypt the contents and the name of each
file. The encryption is done in CBC mode with a zero initialization vector.
Contains 100 public RSA-3072 keys with the public exponent 65537 (A total of 300
different public keys were detected in various samples).
Has the capability of downloading and launching malware.

The cryptographic scheme
Generating an infected computer ID
1. The Trojan obtains the computer name (comp_name) with the help of API function
GetComputerName, and the number of processes (num_cpu) with the help of API
function GetSystemInfo;
2. Using the serial number of the system volume, it calculates a 32-bit constant and
converts it into a HEX string (vol_const);
3. Obtains data about the OS version (os_version) divided with the symbol “;” (e.g.
“5;1;2600;1;Service Pack 3”);
4. Creates the string comp_namenum_cpuvol_constos_version;
5. Calculates the MD5 hash of this string;
6. Converts the MD5 hash into a HEX string and uses its first 20 characters as the
computer’s ID.

Receiving key data
When the computer ID has been generated, the Trojan attempts to connect to the C&C
server located in the Tor network, sends the computer ID to it and receives the public RSA
key in return. If the connection attempt fails, one of the 100 public RSA keys hardcoded in
the Trojan body is selected.

Encrypting files

5/12

The algorithm AES 256 in CBC mode is used to encrypt files. For each encrypted file, two
random 256-bit AES keys are generated: one is used to encrypt the file’s contents, while the
other is used to encrypt the file name. These keys are placed in the utility structure key_data,
which is then encrypted with the selected RSA key (so it takes up 384 bytes after encryption)
and placed at the end of the encrypted file:

In C syntax, this stricture can be written as follows:

The Trojan attempts to rename the encrypted file using the result of the calculation
Base64(AES_encrypt(original file name)).xtbl (e.g. ArSxrr+acw970LFQw.xtbl). Failing
this, it simply adds the extension .ytbl to the original file name. In later versions, the Trojan
adds the infected computer’s ID and then the extension .xtbl to the file name, e.g.
ArSxrr+acw970LFQw.043C17E72A1E91C6AE29.xtbl.

Communication with a C&C server
The address of one C&C server is contained in the Trojan’s body. The servers are located in
the Tor network and communication is established using a Tor client that is statically linked to
the Trojan.
The sample sends the following requests to the C&C server:
1. Request for a new public RSA key:
GET http://<server>.onion/reg.php?i=ID&b=build&v=version&ss=stage
ID – the ID of the infected computer;
build – the ID of the specific Trojan sample;
version – the Trojan’s version (we encountered versions 1 and 2);
stage – the stage of encryption – request for a new public key or a message about
completing file encryption.

6/12

2. Error message:
GET http://<server>.onion/err.php?i=ID&b=build&v=version&err=error
error – a base64-coded message about an error during encryption.
3. Report about the encryptor’s current stage:
GET http://<server>.onion/prog.php?
i=ID&b=build&v=version&ss=stage&c=count&f=finish
count – the current count of encrypted files;
finish – the flag showing that encryption has completed.
4. Information about the system:
POSThttp://<server>.onion/sys.php?
i=ID&b=build&v=version&ss=stage&c=count&k=key_number&si=info
key_number – the number of the selected RSA key (if the key was not received from
the server, but selected from the keys contained in the Trojan’s body);
info – information collected from the infected computer:
Computer name
User name
IP address
Computer domain
List of logical drives
Windows version
List of installed software
5. Request for a list of URL addresses from which additional malware needs to be
downloaded and launched:
GET http://<server>.onion/cmd.php?i=ID&b=build&v=version

Propagation of the encryptor
Partnership program
The code that the user is prompted to email to the cybercriminals can have the form ID|0 if
the public code was received from the C&C server, or ID|key_number|build|version if one
of the public RSA keys hardcoded in the Trojan’s body was selected, with the corresponding
number used for the value key_number. ID is the identity of the infected computer, build
and version are numeric values that denote respectively the ID of the specific Trojan sample
and the encryptor’s version.
While analyzing the Trojan’s samples, we detected several combinations of the ‘build’ value,
email addresses used to communicate with the cybercriminals, and C&C addresses.
Different ‘build’ values are associated with different email addresses, although the same
C&C can serve several different samples of the Trojan:
build

We observed the propagation of different samples from the encryptor’s two versions. For
each specific sample of the same version of the Trojan there existed a unique combination of
‘build’ (ID of the specific sample) and the email address (for communication with the
cybercriminals).
Although we found no partnership notices, based on the data we can assume the Trojan is
distributed, and the ransom collected, via a partnership network. Possibly, the malware
sample IDs (the ‘build‘ value) and the different email addresses are associated with various
partners responsible for distributing this malicious program.

Downloaded malware: Trojan for brute forcing website passwords
Among the malicious programs downloaded by Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Shade is a trojan
used for brute forcing website passwords. The internal organization of the brute forcer is very
similar to that of the encryptor Trojan itself – it was most probably created by the same team
of cybercriminals. This downloaded brute forcer Trojan has been assigned the verdict
Trojan.Win32.CMSBrute.

Common features of the CMSBrute family
9/12

Written in C++ using STL and its own classes.
Statically linked with the Tor client.
Uses boost (threads), curl, OpenSSL libraries.
Each sample has a hardwired URL to one C&C server. A total of three C&C server
addresses were detected in different samples. All the C&Cs are located in the Tor
network and are different from the addresses encountered in the TrojanRansom.Win32.Shade samples.
All strings (along with the names of imported functions) are AES encrypted. When the
program launches, they are decrypted and the import table is then dynamically
populated.
Typically UPX packed. Once unpacked, it is 2080-2083 KB in size.
Copies itself to one of the C drive folders with the name csrss.exe.
Downloads additional DLL plugins. The plugins contain code that determines the
content management system (CMS) installed on the targeted site, searches for the
administration console and cracks passwords. We have detected plugins for websites
based on Joomla, WordPress and DataLifeEngine.

Communication with the C&C server
Each sample of Trojan.Win32.CMSBrute contains the address of one C&C server. The
servers are located in the Tor network and communication with them is established using the
Tor client that is statically linked to the Trojan.
The sample sends the following requests to the C&C server:
1. Register new bot:
GET http://<server>.onion/reg.php?n=ID&b=build&v=version&sf=stage
ID – the ID of the infected computer. It is calculated using a slightly different algorithm
than the one used for the Shade encryptor;
build – the ID of the specific sample of the malicious program. We have encountered
build1 only;
version – the version of the malicious program. We have encountered version 1 only;
stage – the stage of the Trojan’s operation.
2. A request to receive URL addresses for downloading/updating DLL plugins.
GET http://<server>.onion/upd.php?n=ID&b=build&v=version&p=plugins
3. Request for a task to determine the CMS on the website and to check the login
credentials:
GET http://<server>.onion/task.php?n=ID&b=build&v=version&p=plugins
plugins – the versions of installed DLL plugins.
The server’s response comes in the JSON format and contains URLs of the websites
to be attacked and a dictionary for breaking passwords.

10/12

4. Send a brute force report:
POST http://<server>.onion/rep.php?n=ID&b=build&v=version&rep=report
report – a JSON string containing a report about the CMS found on the website, as
well as broken login credentials to the administration console.

Recommendations
In the case of Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Shade, all advice that was previously given on how to
counteract encryptors is still relevant. Detailed instructions are available at:
https://support.kaspersky.com/10952
If your computer has already suffered an attack by this Trojan, it is extremely important that
you run a full scan and treat it with an anti-malware solution. Remember that TrojanRansom.Win32.Shade downloads and installs malware belonging to several various families,
as stated at the beginning of this article.
