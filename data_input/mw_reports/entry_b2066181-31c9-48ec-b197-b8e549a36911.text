unable to stop them

On December 30, 2021, in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pinned the
Order of Friendship on the suit of his Hungarian counterpart Péter Szijjártó. Although the
medal was presented by Lavrov, it was Russian President Vladimir Putin himself who
decided to award it. Not coincidentally, the medal, which is in the form of a wreath of olive
branches encircling a globe, includes the inscription “Peace and Friendship” in Cyrillic on the
back, is the highest Russian state decoration that can be awarded to a foreigner.
“I am proud that, despite the extremely unfavourable global and regional developments
of recent years, while respecting our obligations to our alliances, we have also
been able to maintain our cooperation with Moscow based on mutual trust and in line
with our national interests”, the Hungarian Foreign Minister boasted on his Facebook
page.

Péter Szijjártó knew long ago that Russia’s intelligence services had attacked and hacked
into the IT systems of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFA), which he headed. By
the second half of 2021, it had become clear that the Russians had completely compromised
the foreign ministry’s computer network and internal correspondence. Furthermore, they had
also hacked into the encrypted network used to transmit “restricted” and “confidential” state
secrets and diplomatic information, which can only be used under strict security measures.
According to an internal document we obtained, the foreign ministry was still under targeted
attacks in January 2022. Details of the Russian hacking of the foreign ministry’s
communications channels were shared with us by former state officials, among others, who
learned of the incident from officials with direct knowledge of it.
According to former intelligence officials, the cyber attack trail suggests that hacker groups
working for Russian intelligence are clearly behind the operations against Hungary’s foreign
ministry. These hackers work for the Federal Security Service, FSB, which was previously
headed by Putin, and for the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU. According to our
sources, these hacker groups have been well known to the Hungarian state authorities for a
long time, as they have been continuously attacking Hungarian government networks for at
least a decade. Russian attacks against Hungary are most often related to hacks against
other NATO countries, and members of the Western alliance regularly cooperate and share
information to identify these offensive cyber operations.
Hungarian diplomacy has become practically an open book for Moscow through the hacking
of the ministry’s networks. Russians are able to know in advance what the Hungarian foreign
ministry is thinking and planning, and this is happening at a very sensitive time. Russian
infiltration remained active before and partly after the invasion of Ukraine, during the current
EU and NATO crisis summits. Meanwhile, there is no sign that the Hungarian government
has publicly protested to Russia about the cyberespionage.
Direkt36 uncovered the Russian intelligence operations against the Hungarian foreign
ministry and the inadequacy of Hungarian counter-intelligence measures, going back at least
a decade, with the help of foreign ministry documents and more than thirty background
interviews. For example, we spoke to former Hungarian intelligence and security officers who
had worked on Russian intelligence-related fields and had concrete information on many of
the cases described in this article. Sources familiar with the internal affairs of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade shared information about the ministry’s handling of the
cyberattack.
We sent detailed questions about all the main findings in the article to the foreign ministry,
the Ministry of Interior – which is primarily responsible for cyber defence and counterintelligence – and the Prime Minister’s Office last week. We have not yet received any
response. (After the publication of this article, the foreign ministry replied to other media
outlets saying “we do not pay attention to campaign lies”.)

Foreign ministry staff were not told that their computers were
already infected
Since autumn 2021, unusual messages have appeared on internal mailing lists at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While ministry staff had previously received such
cybersecurity-related emails only occasionally, from last year they kept frequently coming.
According to a foreign ministry diplomatic cable obtained by Direkt36, it was announced on
November 11, 2021 that “the Ministry’s Cyber Security Project is being developed to
strengthen the MFA’s IT and cyber security”. As a first step, an email address has been
created to which foreign ministry officials are invited to “report cybersecurity-related issues
(e.g. phishing email, DDOS attack, ransomware virus attack, password leak, data leak)”.

Before Christmas, the ministry had already issued instructions to Hungarian diplomatic
missions restricting the use of mobile phones for official work. Then, on January 7, 2022, the
cyber security project officer scolded staff for not complying with the new policy. “Technical
investigations carried out to increase the information and cyber security of the MFA have
shown that the MFA’s official correspondence is not carried out exclusively using the types of
devices and programs authorised for this purpose,” another internal cable obtained by
Direkt36 stated.
The cables have led to growing suspicions in the MFA that the problem could be quite
serious. One source familiar with the ministry’s internal affairs thought at the time that the
Chinese might have hacked the foreign ministry’s system. One of the ministry’s cables hints
at this: “Measurable amounts of devices are in use that have been proven to communicate
personal data to China in a covert manner. These include (but are not limited to) Huawei
(ZTE), Honor, Xiaomi, Wiko, OnePlus, among others”.

This cable is not only remarkable because it highlights serious vulnerabilities of government
communication. The letter is also interesting because it shows that the Orbán government is
aware of the security risk posed by Chinese devices, while in public they denied it for years.
Moreover, the Orbán government has been one of the biggest supporters of the use of
Chinese telecommunications devices in Europe. Szijjártó, for example, has repeatedly stood
up for Huawei and claimed that the Chinese company’s devices do not pose any risk.
Other vulnerabilities are also reported in the MFA cables. According to one, an internal
investigation has also revealed that many bureaucrats prefer to use an American email client
called BlueMail, which is also dangerous. According to the cyber defence project officer,
BlueMail “openly stores entered passwords; has many programming flaws that can be easily
exploited in an attack; constantly sends mobile device data to three different servers”.
Just a week after the letter warning against Chinese devices, on 14 January 2022, the MFA
issued a broad warning about a different kind of threat, saying that a phishing email attack
“appeared in several foreign embassies this week”. The phishing email, written in English,
claimed that the recipient’s password for their @mfa.gov.hu ministry email account was
about to expire and needed to be changed. “Passwords entered will be automatically
assigned to the attacker’s email address, which will be immediately forwarded to
unauthorised users who can easily gain access to the full contents of the inbox,” the warning
said.
However, the MFA’s Cyber Security Project was not launched solely to raise awareness, and
internal investigations have not only revealed potential risks. By the second half of 2021, it
had also become apparent to the ministry’s leadership that Russian hackers were behind the
active, serious infection of ministry systems, several former Hungarian state officials told
Direkt36. They had details from colleagues with direct knowledge of the Russian operation or
who had previously worked in fields related to Russian intelligence.

Based on the hackers’ known methods from previous cyber attacks in Hungary and abroad,
the infection technique and other clues they left behind (IP addresses, origin and destination
of network traffic, targets), it was clear from the beginning to the agencies involved in
investigating the attack on the Hungarian MFA that Russian intelligence services had
attacked the ministry. For example, some of the leads were specifically linked to, or bore an
uncanny resemblance to known attacks against other NATO countries which had already
been identified as being carried out by Russia.
The infection entered the Hungarian MFA partly through phishing attacks and email
attachments containing malwares and viruses, and then spread throughout the internal
network – computers of the ministry at Bem Square in Budapest and in more than 150 sites
of more than 90 Hungarian foreign missions were all affected. According to the former
officials, the infection had been lurking for years and was discovered so late that it is
impossible to say in retrospect at what points and in how many different ways the Russians
had hacked into the MFA’s systems.
According to sources familiar with the internal affairs of the ministry, agencies responsible for
the security of the networks informed Péter Szijjártó and the top leadership of the MFA at
least six months ago. Since then, Minister of Interior Sándor Pintér and his ministry’s heads
have also been filled in on the details by the security agencies they oversee. At the MFA,
cybersecurity is the responsibility of the ministry’s Security, Information Technology and
Telecommunications Department (BITÁF) and its civil intelligence agency, the Information
Office (IH). At the level of overall government, the agency in charge is the Special Service for
National Security (SSNS). However, according to several former intelligence officers, the
National Infocommunication Service Provider Ltd. (NISZ), as well as the counterintelligence
agency, the Constitution Protection Office (AH) are also involved in mitigating the incident.
Szijjártó told the Hungarian parliament’s committee on national security in early December
last year that the IH – which is also responsible for the national security protection of
Hungarian embassies abroad – had drawn up a new concept to strengthen protection, and
“work on this has started this year as planned”. He added that in the IH, too, “we have taken
more measures to strengthen internal security.” However, he did not say that this had
anything to do with cyber attacks.
At the same committee meeting, Pintér also had a note of concern. After saying that the
Hungarian cyber defence is “entirely” the responsibility of the SSNS, which he oversees, he
added that “regardless of this, each specific agency must implement its cyber defence tasks,
because it is not enough to have a central vision if our individual staff members do not pay
enough attention to computer and internet use”.
Even though Szijjártó and his deputies have been aware of the risks for some time, they
have not disclosed it to the foreign service apparatus beyond general warnings in diplomatic
cables mentioning that their everyday working devices and foreign ministry networks have
been compromised for some time. In addition, the process of expelling the Russian
5/18

intelligence services from the Hungarian foreign ministry networks has been extremely slow
and has not been completed to date. According to former security officials, this is due to,
among other things, fragmented and slow decision-making and a lack of expertise.
Yet Russian cyber attacks against the Hungarian government and the Hungarian MFA have
been occuring for at least a decade.

Russians kept logging in and out of the system
Russian hackers saw everything on the computer of the high-ranking Hungarian government
official as if they were physically sitting in his chair in front of his monitor in Hungary. In the
autumn of 2012, a modified version of a remote access application called TeamViewer was
installed on his computer without his knowledge, allowing them to see virtually everything –
documents, passwords, system settings, network connections.
He was not the only Hungarian government victim of the Russian cyber attack almost a
decade ago, and the targets were not only Hungarians. A few months later, in February
2013, the embassy of a NATO and EU member state in Moscow was also a victim of the
attack, later dubbed TeamSpy, as were research and educational institutions in France and
Belgium, among others. The details of the attack were later published in an anonymised way
in an expert analysis.

The large-scale Russian TeamSpy attack was discovered not by the counterintelligence of
Western countries, but by experts at the cyber defence center of the Hungarian National
Security Authority (NBF), according to a cyber security expert familiar with the incident. The
Hungarian center, called the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CMDA), set up in 2011,
gathered expertise and cyber defence capabilities over ministries and state agencies, and
were so successful that one of their Hungarian experts was elected to head NATO’s cyber
defence task force.
According to a cyber security expert familiar with the incident, the Hungarians responded to
the TeamSpy attack with an aggressive counterattack. They hacked into the Russian attack
infrastructure, identified Russian hackers operating from Russian and Ukrainian Internet
cafes, among others, and obtained the target list of TeamSpy attacks. In a joint operation
with NATO partners, by accessing the victims’ computers around the world, they
simultaneously shut down infected devices, cutting off Russian hackers from a wealth of
information. Such an operation requires serious organisation and expertise, which, according
to several Direkt36 sources familiar with the case and involved in cybersecurity, shows how
advanced Hungarian cyber defence was at the time.
It was in the early 2010s that Russian intelligence services – mainly the Russian Federal
Security Service (FSB) and the Russian military intelligence (GRU) – really started to get into
hacking. “For Russia, cyber warfare is part of a permanent information warfare. This warfare
is based on the perception that the Western world wants to undermine Russia’s position of
power and is ultimately engaged in a comprehensive and continuous effort to subjugate the
country,” AH’s former senior national security officer Péter Buda told Direkt36.
Since the Russians see NATO simply as a military tool of the United States, Buda said, their
cyber espionage “is mainly aimed at detecting information and conflicts of interest that could
disrupt the unity of the NATO alliance, in addition to the continuous monitoring of capabilities
and intentions”. The cyber espionage method, also used by the Russians, called Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT), does not aim at immediate, visible damage, like a simple hacker
attack, but at a persistent presence within the targeted IT system.
While Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was already advertising his pivot towards Russia and
China, Russian hackers of the GRU and FSB – hacking groups known as APT28 and APT29
– treated Hungary as an enemy and attacked it just as they did other EU and NATO member
states. An official of the Orbán government at the time, said that in 2012-2014, in addition to
the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Interior and even the Ministry of
Defence were compromised by hackers. Based on their digital footprint and intelligence
sharing with NATO/EU partners, they were also very likely Russians.
“For example, the attacks came from mispelling domains, such as mail.hm.qov.hu, with QOV
instead of GOV,” the former official recalled. Details of this attack, including screenshots of a
duplicate site of the Ministry of Defence asking for login details, were published in 2016 by a
cybersecurity firm.

However, nothing about the extensive Russian cyber attack on the MFA and its foreign
missions during the second Orbán government has been made public before.
“Every end point of the entire MFA network was infected, everyone was affected. In
fact, the Russians kept logging in and out of the system with domain administrator
privileges,” a former Orbán government official said.
These claims were confirmed by former intelligence officers who also worked in fields related
to countering Russian intelligence. The integrity of the MFA’s systems was eventually
restored around 2013.
Sources have shared numerous stories about the cybersecurity weaknesses that the
Russians may have exploited. For example, one former Hungarian diplomat recalled that a
few years ago it was possible to discuss work matters with the MFA’s state secretaries on
Facebook Messenger – an insecure channel where such communication should not be
allowed at all, and which has been hacked numerous times in recent years. Another example
is that one of the default login passwords used to be “secretXX” (two identical numbers) on
MFA computers. “And if it had to be changed, the number always increased by one. But ‘just
in case we forget’, many secretariats and shared computers preferred to keep the original
password,” the former diplomat added.

8/18

In addition, several databases leaked from hacking attacks years ago are still available
online, containing passwords alongside the email addresses of Hungarian MFA officials. For
example Direkt36 when looking for the contact details of a Hungarian ambassador, through a
simple Google search found not only the diplomat’s private email address, but also a
password beginning with “pussy..”.
A former Orbán government official familiar with Russian cyberattacks also said that in the
first half of the 2010s, the Russians hacked not only the Hungarian MFA’s own documents.
Some of the infected government computers were connected to a zombie network, from
which they continued to attack other NATO member states of greater interest to Moscow.
Zombie networks are computers and devices that hackers have secretly taken control of
from afar and from which they launch coordinated attacks. In some cases, the Hungarian
infection was first detected by a NATO third country attacked from the Hungarian network –
IP addresses made it look like the Hungarian ministry computer was the attacker.
“It’s important to understand that Hungary is not the main target of these attacks, but
the security level of Hungarian public and private infrastructures is simply so poor that
it is the easiest to penetrate here,” a cyber security expert said.
Former Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA) head Ferenc Frész said in a 2015
presentation that much of their work was about addressing these vulnerabilities. But by then
the CDMA had virtually ceased to exist. In his presentation, Frész claimed that Hungarian
cyber defence had been dismantled in a way that had completely eliminated Hungary’s
defence capabilities, and that “it was all done under Russian economic pressure”. He did not
elaborate on what basis he made this claim, and when contacted by Direkt36 he declined to
comment on his statement at the time.

The spectacular pro-Russian turn in Hungarian politics came in 2014, after Orbán and Putin
announced their agreement on the Paks2 nuclear power plant expansion. Then Péter
Szijjártó, who already had extensive Russian connections, took over the leadership of the
MFA. In November 2014, the head of the National Security Authority was fired, the institution
was brought under the Ministry of Interior, and a few months later the staff of the Cyber
Defence Management Authority was laid off as part of a “reorganisation”.
According to a cybersecurity expert familiar with the case, the Orbán government began to
see Hungarian cyber defence as a linchpin of the Hungarian-Russian rapprochement, and
the agreement on the Paks nuclear expansion, among other things, brought a negative turn.
Another cybersecurity expert added that CDMA’s staff have also isolated themselves by
revealing to various ministries, in an unvarnished style and “without much diplomacy”, what
critical vulnerabilities they had found in government networks.
Under the third Orbán government, cyber defence tasks were taken over by agencies under
the Ministry of Interior, primarily the Special Service for National Security (SSNS). However,
after the abolition of the Cyber Defence Management Authority, in fact, all the intelligence
and state agencies started to do a little bit of cyber defence. According to a former official of
the Orbán government, the consequence of this include that the various agencies regularly
point fingers at each other or wait for each other, operate in isolation from each other and
sometimes there is even outright rivalry between them.
The next big wave of Russian attacks instantly showed the weaknesses of the new set-up.

The “institutional hush-up policy” begins
10/18

One morning in November 2016, when the MFA official entered their ministry office at Bem
Square in Budapest, they immediately noticed that their computer had disappeared from
their desk. “At first I was just surprised. I went to our secretary to ask what had happened,
because I can’t work without a computer,” the then MFA official recalled to Direkt36. All the
secretary could find out was that the computer had been infected with some virus and that
another device would arrive at some point.
The virus had entered the computer via an infected email back in October 2016, said a
former Hungarian intelligence officer who shared details of the incident. The Russians misled
the MFA official with a scheme known as spearphishing, which involved editing a deceptive,
personalised email. The email in this particular case may have appeared at first glance to
have been sent by an employee of NATO headquarters in Brussels. Such an email address
and such a person are not actually in the address database of NATO headquarters in
Brussels, and the format of the address was not legit either, a former NATO official told
Direkt36.
The sender’s first name, however, was exactly the same as that of a close foreign
acquaintance of the MFA official. “The name could have been misleading and I obviously
clicked automatically. NATO was also a clever trick, if it wasn’t for the name, I would have
clicked on it because of the NATO name anyway,” the former official said, adding that the
content of the email was completely uninteresting and they could not remember whether they
had clicked on a link or an attachment within the email.
“Nothing suspicious happened after the click, no little skull and crossbones appeared,” they
added. Even when their computer disappeared, the MFA official did not think anything was
wrong, only when the Information Office (IH) later started an investigation, but even that was
reassuring as it exonerated them from any wrongdoing or suspicion. Soon, however,
counterintelligence officers from the Constitution Protection Office (AH) also came in and sat
them down for two rounds of interrogations, and the second time the MFA was hooked up to
a lie detector. They tried to find out if the official was spying for Russia.
According to a former Hungarian intelligence officer, all the elements of the email hoax were
part of a carefully planned psychological effect to get the target to definitely open the email.
The source added that the Russian intelligence service had been studying the MFA official’s
background, contacts and interests for some time. He knows this because the British
intelligence service shared information about all this with the AH, which in turn informed the
IH and the SSNS. Direkt36 sent a comment request to the British embassy about this, but
they have not yet replied.
The opening of the email did not only infect the MFA official’s own computer. “It was a
cancer-like virus that gets into one machine and then spreads through the system to all the
others,” they said. But they only found out about this later, informally, through their senior
government contacts. At the time, a government contact told them that at least 20 other MFA

11/18

officials were also affected. Others who had received similarly personalised, infected emails,
for example, were dealing with NATO, security policy, or the Eastern European region. “My
acquaintance told me that the Russians were trying to get into the system through several
targets, and I was just one of them,” the former MFA official added.
Balázs Bencsik, director of the National Cyber Security Center (NKI), a specialised body
within the Hungarian SSNS, revealed some information about Russian cyber attacks in
Hungary in 2016, following year at the Tusványos Summer University. He did not name a
ministry, but claimed that suspicious activity had been discovered on a Hungarian
government server before the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This Hungarian government
server transmitted data to the Netherlands and Germany. Later, it was also discovered that
these were orchestrated by the same Russian hacking groups who had also hacked into
U.S. Democratic Party servers.
Bencsik added that similar attacks against Hungarian government systems were “frequent
and continuous” but not primarily directed against Hungary. For example, he claimed that the
Hungarian government server hacked in 2016 was used by the Russians to disguise (“IP
address masking”) their attack on the United States during the presidential election
campaign. In other words, the Russians did the same thing again as they did when they
hacked the MFA around 2012-13, and again used the hacked Hungarian government
computers to launch further attacks on other NATO member states.
Russian hackers did not only attack the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade:
during the same period, the Czech Foreign Ministry was also under a very similar Russian
attack, the details of which were published in the Czech Counterintelligence Service (BIS)
Yearbook 2017. Since the beginning of 2016, the Russians have accessed the email
accounts of at least 150 Czech MFA officials, from which all information has been periodically
extracted. In parallel, since December 2016, a different type of less sophisticated “brute
force” attack has been launched against hundreds of Czech MFA email accounts.
Lubomír Zaorálek, then Czech Foreign Minister, revealed in early 2017 that dozens of email
accounts of senior Czech diplomats had been hacked, with some of the stolen information
relating to NATO and EU issues. According to Czech investigative website Neovlivni.cz, even
the email accounts of Zaorálek himself and his state secretaries were hacked and thousands
of documents were downloaded. According to BIS, the compromise of the Czech Foreign
Ministry’s email accounts “in numerous key aspects corresponds to similar cases
of cyberespionage, which took place in other European states over the same period”.
While the Czechs chose to go public, the Orbán government, like during the Hungarian
cases of 2012-2014, kept the cyberattacks on MFA systems in 2016 hidden from the public.
“There was an institutional hush-up policy,” the former MFA official who opened the infected
email said. A few months later, the counterintelligence classified the MFA official as a risk to
national security. In theory, this means that their activities or contacts were deemed
incompatible with their work in the MFA for some reason, hence the official was fired.
12/18

This was done despite the fact that former intelligence officers with knowledge of the details
of the case told Direkt36 that investigations had confirmed that the MFA official had not
colluded with the Russians, but had simply clicked on the email. Moreover, the official later
started working for the government of another European NATO member state, passing that
country’s national security screening without a hitch.
“Unfortunately, several victims have been slaughtered,” a former official of the Orban
government who had direct knowledge of such cases said. According to him, the AH has on
several occasions launched investigations on suspicion of espionage and fired ministry
employees who simply just clicked on infected emails. “They simply don’t believe that these
attacks are really being carried out by all kinds of pimple faced St Petersburg kids,” he
explained. According to the source, this is basically due to the Ministry of Interior’s “senior
policeman mentality”, even when it comes to cyber defence: “What does a policeman do? He
has to respond immediately and nab someone physically” the former official added.
But firing the clicking employees has not helped stop the attacks.

Russians gained access to windowless secret rooms
Completely enclosed, windowless or curtained “VKH rooms” can be found everywhere in the
world where there is a Hungarian diplomatic mission, even in the most remote countries.
These secure rooms protect the endpoints of the closed Protected Foreign Network (Védett
Külügyi Hálózat, VKH), foreign ministry computers that encrypt messages and to which, in
principle, no external device can be connected, a former ambassador of the Orbán
government explained.
VKH rooms are used by foreign ministry staff and Hungarian diplomats when they want to
communicate classified national, NATO or EU information to their colleagues and superiors.
These rooms “may only be entered with a valid personal security certificate and user
authorisation, and in possession of a special card authorisation, or with the written
authorisation and escort of the head of security”, according to the Hungarian MFA’s security
regulations.
Anyone accessing this system can also access Hungarian state secrets and allied
information classified as “restricted” and “confidential”. These are classified data, according
to the law, the disclosure of which to the public or to unauthorised persons would adversely
affect or be harmful to the public interest, and are classified by default for 10 and 20 years
respectively.
The former ambassador recalled the difficult process of communication. If a diplomat wants
to send a message through the VKH, he or she brings their notes on piece of paper into the
room, types the message into a computer on the keyboard and the system encrypts it with a

13/18

randomly generated unique code. Then the piece of paper must be destroyed. No mobile
phones or other electronic devices are allowed in the VKH premises. The system logs the
time spent in the room and the materials accessed.
Russian intelligence had already successfully hacked the VKH network in the first major
wave of attacks in the early 2010s, a former official of the Orbán government with direct
knowledge of the incident told Direkt36. This claim was confirmed by Hungarian diplomats
who also heard about the hacking. The former government official said that around 2013, the
devices in all the VKH rooms around the world, in the ministry on Bem Square and in
Hungarian diplomatic missions abroad were all replaced to restore the integrity of the
network. The former ambassador of the Orbán government recalled that he had been told by
the people from the security department of the ministry who had visited them that the old
equipment was outdated and that the network would be replaced completely.

Replacing the computers almost ten years ago did not solve the problem for long. Several
former intelligence officials familiar with the cyberattack on the Foreign Ministry because of
their agency’s involvement told Direkt36 that the VKH had been hacked again by Russians
using IT tools in recent years. A member of the Hungarian parliament’s foreign affairs
committee recalled that Hungarian diplomats had been saying for at least a year and a half
that the system was again outdated and insecure, and that this was the reason why they had
asked for money to upgrade the VKH.

14/18

However, according to several reports, there were also problems with the physical security of
the system, but no information is available on whether these contributed to the latest breakin.
According to the former ambassador of the Orbán government, for example, a common
problem was that the secure VKH rooms in remote diplomatic representations were not
always properly installed. The foreign affairs committee member confirmed this, adding that
the construction process itself posed a significant risk. For example, during a rebuilding
project, a VKH machine could be left unattended on the construction site. And a former MFA
official recalled an incident from the first half of the 2010s, when the door of a secure VKH
room at a Hungarian mission in Central Asia was found to have been forced open. A similar
incident was also made public in 2017. A diplomat from the Hungarian diplomatic mission in
Uzbekistan reported serious security deficiencies to the Szijjártó-led ministry, without much
traction. He only received an informal reply to stop complaining – “give me a break”.
By hacking the VKH, Russian intelligence services were able to access any of the
documents transmitted on it. Sources who gave details to Direkt36 did not specify exactly
what material was compromised and when. The classified documents transmitted on the
VKH do not only contain information from Hungarian sources. According to the security
regulations of the ministry, confidential NATO and EU documents are also received, and the
former ambassador of the Orbán government added that Hungarian reports transcribing
various NATO or EU meetings are also received through this channel.
But beyond the “restricted” and “confidential” information also transmitted on the VKH, there
is even more strictly protected information, classified by default for thirty years. These are
classified as “secret” or “top secret”. According to the former ambassador of the Orbán
government, no such information has been received by his representation through the VKH
system. He said that documents considered to be highly classified information, could only be
accessed by a narrow internal circle in the Bem Square ministry, through separate channels,
as required by the ministry’s security regulations. Direkt36 has no information that these
even more sensitive channels have been compromised.
According to a former intelligence officer with indirect knowledge of the incident, the integrity
of the VKH system was supposed to be temporarily restored around February 2022, but the
now obsolete VKH machines have not yet been replaced. The source added that the MFA’s
regular internal network remained infected.
Even half a dozen diplomats from EU and NATO member states told Direkt36 in February
2022 that they had not received any official information from the Hungarian foreign ministry
about the Russian cyber attack, its severity or whether it had affected NATO and EU
information. “It should go without saying that if you are unable to eradicate the infection on
your own, you ask for help from allies. The only time you don’t tell them is if you can
immediately repel the attack,” a former NATO official said. The source added that within the
North Atlantic alliance, “there is also a gentlemen’s agreement that if you know your network
15/18

is infected, you try to exclude NATO documents from it”. A senior diplomat from an EU
country, however, said that a government has discretion on what information to share and
what not to share, as there are no specific rules.
But compared to the world of diplomacy, the rules are much clearer for counterintelligence.
“Any vulnerability that allows the compromise of protected data of the allied system causes
damage that is difficult to repair afterwards,” Péter Buda, AH’s former senior national security
officer told Direkt36. According to him, preventing attacks on protected IT systems should be
a top priority. However, if rapid eradication fails, it will wittingly or unwittingly serve the
interests of the attacker.
Unlike the secretive Hungarian diplomacy, however, the Hungarian counterintelligence
service had previously informed its partners of the compromise of the foreign ministry.

Hungarian counterintelligence discussed the problem over a beer
In the autumn of 2021, representatives of Europe’s intelligence services gathered again at
the Club de Berne to discuss current issues, with Russia being the main topic. Club de Berne
is one of the most important intelligence sharing forums between Western
counterintelligence services, where the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Switzerland and
the UK are represented, and where the U.S., Canada and sometimes even Israel are invited.
The Hungarian participant in the intelligence sharing forum is the Constitution Protection
Office (AH).
This time, intelligence officers did not gather for a meeting at the most senior level, but for a
lower-level expert meeting. In such cases, the invited participants are mid-level managers,
say counter-intelligence directors, who are familiar with the concrete details of major
operations and can discuss them with their foreign counterparts. However, the most
important part of the agenda is not the relatively formal and generic daytime conference
programme, but the evening dinner and beer where a lot of interesting information is shared.
A former intelligence officer with indirect knowledge of what happened at last autumn’s
meeting told Direkt36 that it was also at this time, during an informal drinking session after
the formal meetings, that the Hungarian AH representative told his Western colleagues that
the Hungarian MFA had apparently come under extremely heavy Russian infiltration. In
response, several European participants immediately began to list the number and variety of
hacking attempts made by Russians in their countries in the recent past.
The most recent case was in Germany, where the email accounts of Bundestag members
and other politicians were hacked during the German election campaign, which the Russians
“combined with disinformation and influence operations”, according to a report on the
website of the SSNS’s National Cyber Security Center. Similar Russian cyber attacks have
hit Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland in recent years. These EU countries

followed roughly the same protocol in dealing with cyber espionage: they detected the
trouble, took more or less swift action to counter it, shared information with their allies, and
then finally made the incident public and protested to Russia.
According to the former intelligence officer, the AH representative did not share information
with Club de Berne members on the specific official orders of the MFA or the Orbán
government. “The AH has a fundamental interest in sharing information, because if it doesn’t
give, it doesn’t get,” said a cybersecurity expert who has had previous ties to the agency.
The example of Austria, who were effectively suspended from the club a few years ago for
their unreliability, could also serve as a deterrent to the Hungarian intelligence services. “One
of the most important areas for NATO in the last few years has been the strengthening of
alliance-level cooperation in countering Russian cyber attacks,” explained former senior AH
officer Péter Buda on the importance of information sharing on Russian matters.
In recent months, following the Club de Berne meeting, the news of the hacking of the
Hungarian MFA has reached a much wider audience of foreign and security policy experts,
including foreigners. “It is now common knowledge in the European intelligence community
that the Russians have hacked the Hungarian foreign ministry and that many Hungarian
diplomatic missions have been compromised,” said an EU national security official who
learned of the hack from his own institution in January 2022.
But beyond secret intelligence sharing, the Orbán government is conspicuously refraining
from openly confronting Russian intelligence activity. For example, Direkt36 previously
revealed that Russian spies caught in the act in Hungary are always “quietly expelled”, i.e.
they are simply sent home and spy affairs are never made public.
As for the only Hungarian exception, the case of the Russian diplomat in Budapest who was
expelled after the Skripal poisoning, we revealed that Budapest and Moscow had
deliberately conducted the expulsion and counter-expulsion in a way that would not damage
friendly relations. For example, a Russian was expelled from Budapest when he had finished
his diplomatic posting and was preparing to return home anyway.
There are also quite spectacular examples of soft handling of Russian espionage. Former
Hungarian diplomat to Moscow Szilárd Kiss, for example, was allowed to stay in his post
even after he failed two national security screenings because of his Russian intelligence
connections. As for former MEP Béla Kovács, who has since been convicted of preparations
to commit espionage, Péter Szijjártó told Index.hu that he had not raised the issue with any
former Russian ambassador. Since then, Kovács has been living and teaching in Moscow
and is currently analysing the invasion of Ukraine on Russian propaganda websites.
The last time Hungary made international news on Russian cyber espionage was a few
weeks ago, when it emerged that the Orbán government was blocking Ukraine, which has
suffered serious Russian cyber attacks, from joining NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence

the veto. Orbán was only willing to lift his veto after the Russian military invasion of Ukraine.
