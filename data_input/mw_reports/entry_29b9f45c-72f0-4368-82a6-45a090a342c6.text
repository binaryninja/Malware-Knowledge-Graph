Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop

Executive Summary
Many seemingly unrelated cyber attacks may, in
fact, be part of a broader offensive fueled by a
shared development and logistics
infrastructure—a finding that suggests some
targets are facing a more organized menace than
they realize.
This report examines 11 advanced persistent
threat (APT) campaigns targeting a wide swath
of industries. Though they appeared unrelated at
first, further investigation uncovered several key
links between them: the same malware tools, the
same elements of code, binaries with the same
timestamps, and signed binaries with the same
digital certificates.
Taken together, these commonalities point to
centralized APT planning and development. How
prevalent this model has become is unclear. But
adopting it makes financial sense for attackers,
so the findings may imply a bigger trend.

malware tools and weapons to support cyber
espionage. This digital quartermaster also might
be a cyber arms dealer of sorts, a common
supplier of tools used to conduct attacks and
establish footholds in targeted systems.
Shared builder tool
SFireEye researchers located a builder tool likely
used in some of the 11 APT campaigns. The tools
appear to be written in Chinese, and the testing
infrastructure appears to all be configured with
the native Chinese language character set, and
the dialogues and menu options in the builder
tool are in Chinese.
The Sunshop connection
In May 2013, FireEye first reported on the
“Sunshop” campaign, which compromised several
strategic websites and redirected visitors to a site
serving multiple exploits.1 In August 2013,
FireEye reported that the campaign was
continuing2 and, later that month, discovered
additional related attacks.

This report focuses on two key findings:
•

Shared development and logistics

•

A shared malware-builder tool

Shared development and logistics
Examining the 11 APT campaigns revealed a
shared development and logistics operation used
to support several APT actors in distinct but
overlapping campaigns. This development and
logistics operation is best described as a “digital
quartermaster.” Its mission: supply and maintain

Examining the underlying infrastructure of these
attacks revealed that the campaign utilized
resources shared across other APT campaigns
not initially tied to Sunshop.
The other campaigns included multiyear
onslaughts targeting companies across 15
industries. Given the wide range of targets
observed, the campaigns’ specific objectives
(beyond the obvious intellectual property theft)
are unclear.

Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop

FireEye detected activity from the campaigns
between July 2011 and September 2013, but
they were likely active before then. Though the
campaigns utilized varying techniques, tactics,
and procedures (TTPs), they all leveraged a
common development infrastructure. They
shared (in various combinations) the following:
•

Portable executable resources

•

Digital certificates

•

API import tables

•

Compile times

•

Command-and-control (CnC) infrastructure

•

[Medium Confidence] SDQ does not exist,
and APT actors informally share among
each other. Alternatively, different actors
may be responsible for the documented 11
clusters of activity. Instead of relying on a
centralized development and logistics
operation, they share TTPs through formal or
informal channels.

Introduction

Based on the evidence, this report outlines the
following possible conclusions:
•

•

3

5 www.fireeye.com

[High Confidence] A “Sunshop Digital
Quartermaster” (SDQ) exists and supports
separate APT campaigns. FireEye believes
that the most likely explanation for these
links is a shared development and logistics
operation that supports several APT
campaigns as part of formal offensive
apparatus.
[Low Confidence] SDQ and APT campaigns
are a single actor. Another conceivable
possibility is tha the 11 clusters of activity,
previously believed to be independent
campaigns run by different actors, are in fact
one cluster of activity run by one wellresourced actor. However, we believe this
scenario is less likely because each cluster of
activity utilized malware samples with
different artifacts such as passwords,
campaign identifiers, and mutexes. These
artifacts were generally consistent within
each cluster of activity but differed across
clusters.

Ned Moran. “Ready for Summer: The Sunshop Campaign.” May 2013.
Ibid. “The Sunshop Campaign Continues.” August 2013.

TOn May 20, 2013 FireEye first reported on the
Sunshop campaign.3 The actor responsible for this
campaign compromised a number of strategic
websites, redirecting visitors to a site serving
multiple exploits. Almost three months later,
FireEye reported that the campaign was
continuing.4 We discovered additional related
attacks about a week after that. During the
intervening time, we examined the underlying
infrastructure supporting these attacks and found
that the Sunshop campaign utilized resources
shared across a number of other APT campaigns
not initially tied to Sunshop.
What we initially believed to be 11 different APT
campaigns used the same malware tools, the same
elements of code, binaries with the same
timestamps, and signed binaries with the same
digital certificates. Through this discovery, we
believe that we have identified a shared
development and logistics operation used to
support a number of different APT actors engaged
in distinctive but overlapping campaigns. This
development and logistics operation is best
described as a digital quartermaster whose mission
is to supply and maintain malware tools and
weapons used in support of cyber espionage
operations. This digital quartermaster is a possible
cyber arms dealer, supplying the operators
responsible for conducting attacks and establishing
footholds within targeted organizations. As such,
we refer to this entity as the Sunshop Digital
Quartermaster (SDQ).

Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop

To support this conclusion, we first present an
overview of our research, including the total
number and type of malicious binaries we found to
be related to Sunshop and the 10 other linked
campaigns. We then describe the underlying
infrastructure, including the components of code
used across these campaigns. We further describe
the different clusters of APT activity that we
previously believed to be unrelated. Finally, we
describe one of the malware builders we believe
was used to support one of these clusters of APT
activity.

Overview
We collected 110 unique binaries, which were
detected as Trojan.APT.9002, Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy,
Trojan.APT.Gh0st, Trojan.APT.Kaba, and Trojan.
APT.Briba. Sixty-five of these binaries were
packaged with two unique manifest resources, and
47 were signed with six different digital certificates.
The binaries connected to 54 unique fully qualified
domains.

Table 1: APT malware samples linked to the SDQ

We identified these samples by searching binaries
packaged with the two unique portable executable
(PE) resources that we had previously identified.
We believe that these PE resources are unique to
Sunshop and the 10 other linked campaigns.
We also searched for samples signed with the six
different digital certificates that were used to sign
binaries connected to these campaigns. These
certificates were not unique to these campaigns
and have been used to sign unrelated malware.
Therefore, we cross-checked samples signed with
any of these certificates to ensure that they were, in
fact, related to the 10 campaigns we identified as
linked to Sunshop.
As we identified related campaigns that leveraged
the unique PE resources or digital certificates, we
then pivoted off the CnC infrastructure to identify
additional samples. We cross-checked samples
identified through this process to ensure that they
did indeed share the code elements that we
previously identified as unique to Sunshop and its
associated campaigns.
We searched our internal repositories, including
the FireEye high performance cluster and other
wellknown external repositories. We primarily
relied on running active searches with YARA
signatures designed to identify samples, with either
the PE resources or digital certificates. We also
compared the import tables used in each sample to
establish additional links between the 10 different
campaigns linked to Sunshop.
All of this research led us to the above-mentioned
110 binaries. Figure 2 plots the samples in a
Maltego chart.

Figure 6. Comparison of Sunshop (left) and DTL
(right) PE resource manifests

We found 20 samples using the DTL manifest.
These binaries were detected as Trojan.APT.9002.
We observed these 20 samples used in five of the
11 different campaigns discussed below.
The only difference between these manifest
resources is the indentation of the <security>
elements. Lines 10 through 13 in Figure 6 detail
this difference.
This slight difference results in a different hash for
the resource. The similarity between these two
manifests would likely go unnoticed by automated
analysis. Also, the XML is improperly formatted,
hinting that it was formatted manually. As an
experiment, we used NSIS v2.34 to create our

own simple installer and found that the XML in the
manifest had no new-line or tab characters.
Import tables
We utilized a simple technique to identify
similarities in import tables between the 110
different samples we analyzed during our analysis.
We aggregated the import calls found in each
sample and used this as a unique fingerprint. We
then used these fingerprints to cluster similar
samples together.
The Python code in Figure 6 relies on the module
pefile and can be used to dump all the import calls
used in a specific binary. The output can then be
easily hashed.

pe = pefile.PE(file)
for entry in pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT:
for imp in entry.imports:
if imp.name != None:
print entry.dll, imp.name, hex(imp.address)
else:
print entry.dll, hex(imp.address)

Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop

We found 33 unique import tables used for the
110 different samples we collected during our
research. The most common import table seen
had a MD5 hash of
3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51
and appeared in 38 different binaries. This
particular import table appeared in both Trojan.
APT.9002 and Trojan. APT.PoisonIvy binaries. It
was used in eight of the 11 different clusters of
activity we studied during this analysis. In addition
to the identical import tables, these samples have
the same code base, differing in the unpacking
routine for the actual payload, indicating that they
are general-purpose launchers.

import table hash of
3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51

Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop

Authenticode/digital certificates analysis
Digital certificates are used to validate the
authenticity of code. Attackers often use stolen or
spoofed digital certificates to sign their malicious
code and improve the likelihood that their code
will execute successfully on its target.
During our research, we found six digital
certificates used to sign 44 different malware
samples. These certificates are currently revoked
or expired and were signed by Microsoft,
Sinacom, Facesun.cn, Mgame Corp,
Guangzhou YuanLuo Technology Co.,
Ltd., and Wuhan Tian Chen Information
Technology Co., Ltd. The full details of
these certificates are available in Appendix A.
According to Kaspersky, the Mgame Corp. and
Guangzhou YuanLuo Technology Co.,
Ltd. certificates were stolen.5 Whether the
remaining certificates were also stolen—or were
ever valid—is unclear.

The most common compile time was December
19, 2012 at 20:25. We found 28 binaries compiled
at this time. All of these binaries were detected as
Trojan.APT.9002 and utilized the Sunshop PE
resource. We observed samples with this
timestamp in six of the 11 clusters of APT activity
we studied during this research.
The next most common compile time was July 21,
2012 at 14:50. We identified five samples
compiled at this time. All of these samples were
detected as Trojan.APT.9002 and utilized the DTL
PE resource. These samples appeared in two of
the 11 campaigns.
The use of this same compile times across a
number of different campaigns is another
indication that a common development and
logistics infrastructure supported these disparate
operations.

Clusters
The certificates from Mgame Corp and Wuhan
Tian Chen Information Technology
Co. ,Ltd. were used most frequently. We
found 24 samples signed with the certificate from
Mgame Corp. These samples were all detected
as Trojan.APT.9002 and appeared in four of the 10
campaigns we studied during this research.

The shared characteristics were used across
malware tools used in at least 11 different clusters
of APT activity. These clusters were originally
believed to be separate and distinct campaigns
and were grouped together based on shared CnC
infrastructure using passive DNS data or
registration information.

We found 15 samples signed with the certificate
from Wuhan Tian Chen Information
Technology Co., Ltd. These samples were
all detected as Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy and appeared
in one of the 10 campaigns discussed below.

Cluster 1: Sunshop
The Sunshop campaign appears to primarily
leverage strategic Web compromise as a vector of
attack. We have detailed the specifics of the
Sunshop campaign on the FireEye blog.6 We found
15 different samples linked to the Sunshop
campaign. These samples were detected as Trojan.
APT.Gh0st, Trojan. APT.PoisonIvy, Trojan.APT.
Briba, and Trojan.APT.9002. All of the Sunshop
samples that we identified had compile times
between January 1, 2013 and August 24, 2013.
Twelve of the 15 utilized the Sunshop PE

Compile times
Although the compilation time of binaries can be
easily forged, analyzing them is still useful. The
timestamp may not reveal when a binary was
actually compiled, but it can be used to cluster
samples by identical compile times.

Cluster 2: DTL
The DTL campaign appears to depend primarily on
spear-phishing email as an initial infection vector.
We found seven different samples linked to the
DTL campaign. All of these samples were detected
as Trojan.APT.9002. These samples were
compiled between September 19, 2012 and July
30, 2013. All of these samples were packaged
with the DTL PE resource, and one of the samples
was signed with the digital certificate from
Mgame Corp.

Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop

Cluster 3: Ru.pad62
The Ru.pad62 campaign appears to utilize both
spear-phishing email and strategic Web
compromise as initial infection vectors. We found
26 different samples linked to the Ru.pad62
campaign. These samples were detected as Trojan.
APT.9002, Trojan.APT.Gh0st, Trojan.APT.Kaba,
and Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy. The 26 linked samples
had compile timestamps between September 19,
2011 and December 19, 2012. Ten of the samples
from the Ru.pad62 campaign were packaged with
the DTL resource, and six of the samples were
packaged with the Sunshop resource. Only four
samples linked to the Ru.pad62 campaign were
signed with digital certificates—two with the
Mgame Corp. certificate and two with a
certificate from Microsoft.

When executed, the Ru.pad62 samples we found

Cluster 4: Downmicrisoft
The Downmicrisoft campaign appears to utilize
strategic Web compromise as an initial infection
vector. We found five different samples linked to
the Downmicrisoft campaign. These samples were
detected as Trojan.APT.9002 and Trojan.APT.
Gh0st. The five samples had compile timestamps
between December 19, 2012 and April 4, 2013.
The earliest compile time for samples from the
Downmicrisoft campaign (December 19, 2012)
was the same day as the latest compile time for
samples from the Ru.Pad62 campaign. Three of
the samples linked to the Downmicrisoft campaign
were packaged with the Sunshop PE resource, and
all but one sample was signed with the Mgame
Corp. digital certificate.

not use the default “Gh0st” string. Instead, this
sample used the string “HTTPS”. Gh0st variants
with this same string were described by RSA in a
2012 paper.7
Cluster 5: Boeing-Job
The Boeing-Job campaign appears to utilize
strategic Web compromises as an initial infection
vector. We previously discussed the Boeing-Job
campaign’s use of the “Lady Boyle” Flash exploit on
the FireEye blog.8 We identified 19 different
samples linked to the Boeing-Job campaign. These
samples were all detected as Trojan.APT.9002 and
had compile timestamps between July 21, 2012
and April 3, 2013. Seven of the samples from the
Boeing-Job campaign were packaged with both
the Sunshop PE resource, and all but two were
signed with the Mgame Corp. digital certificate.

Table 12: Allshell-related
malware and compile times

Shared Builders
These observed shared characteristics across
these malware samples are likely the result of a
set of common “builders” developed by a shared
development and logistics infrastructure.
Builders are tools used by malicious actors to
quickly and easily create different variants of the
same malware. In a typical scenario, a skilled
developer creates a builder and shares it with an
operator more skilled in intrusion operations than
in code development. This separation of tasks is
more efficient and supports a faster tempo of
offensive operations. A typical builder provides a
graphical user interface that enables a threat
actor to configure elements such as the location of
the CnC server.

To recap, these shared characteristics, as
discussed in previous sections, include the
following:
•

The Sunshop and DTL PE resources

•

Common import tables

•

Six different digital certificates

•

Common compile times

•

Common malware families

We identified a builder tool used to create Trojan.APT.9002 binaries, which we are dubbing “9002
Builder.” This builder generates Trojan.APT.9002 binaries with the DTL resource.

As shown in Figure 10, the dialogue and menu
options in this GUI are in Chinese. The builder
enables threat actors to configure the following:

•

Proxy settings, including address/port, type,
proxy authentication details, auto-detect
proxy, and force-proxy only.

•

Both a primary and a secondary CnC server.

•

A specific ID. The default ID produced by this
builder is “1.”

•

An “Internet health check” domain. The
default health check domain configured in
this builder was “update.microsoft.com”. An
Internet health check domain is typically used
by malware to determine whether a target’s
endpoint is connected to the Internet before
acting.

Also, the text in the title bar of this builder is
“[User_Server_Builder] update 2012-7-21”.
Although the servers produced by this builder
have a compile time of 10/23/12 8:30 UTC, we
believe the date in the title bar of the builder is
significant; we identified five different binaries
with a compile time of 7/21/12.
All five utilized the same DTL resource found in
9002 Builder.

the same DTL resource found in 9002 Builder

Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop

The 9002 Builder appears to be a modified variant
of the builder used to create the samples listed in
Table 12. The compile time of the builder is
10/23/2012 11:18 UTC, a little less than 3 hours
after the compile time of the server that is
produced by it. We believe it is a common practice
for the developer to compile a new server, update
the builder code accordingly, then compile the
new builder. The older date in the title bar may
just be an oversight as i t would have to be
manually updated by the developer.

The builder contains a copy of the server
executable in its PE resource section, under BIN.
The server executable is responsible for installing
the 9002 payload malware, and has its
configuration block stored in its .data section,
with some default settings including the CnC
pointing to 192.168.8.105. The configuration
block uses simple, single-byte XOR encryption.
The key varies from version to version; in some
cases, it skips null bytes. During the installation
routine, the configuration block is written to the
registry value sysinfo under the registry key
HKCU\Software\Classes.

Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop

When the threat actor builds a malware
executable, the builder writes the server
executable to disk and overwrites the
configuration block with the newly configured
options. The location of the configuration block
within the .data section is hard-coded, meaning
that the builder must be modified each time the
server code is updated and the location of the
configuration block changes. We noticed that the
configuration block is indeed stored at a different
offset in the samples compiled on 7/21/12 as
compared to the sample created by the builder
we have with the compile date of 10/23/12. This
further supports our belief in the practice of the
developer compiling the server and then shortly
after compiling the builder. He would need time
to locate the new offset of the configuration
block in the newly compiled server executable

and then change the hard-coded value in the
builder code.
Attackers using 9002 Builder seem to have
gradually adopted another launcher that stores
the configuration block as a resource instead of
storing it in its .data section. Based on the
compile-time analysis outlined in the “Compile
Times” section of this report, the shift began in
late October of 2012 (with a few exceptions). This
shift makes sense for the builder’s developer(s);
they no longer needed to update the builder for
every code change in the launcher or 9002
payload malware. This launcher, mentioned earlier
in this paper as having the import table hash
3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51,
supports different payloads, such as Poison Ivy
and 9002.

Conclusion
Based on the evidence provided, we draw the
following possible conclusions:
[High Confidence] SDQ exists and supports
separate APT campaigns. We believe the most
likely explanation for these documented
correlations is that a shared ‘development and
logistics’ operation (SDQ) supports a number of
different APT campaigns, as part of formal
offensive apparatus.
[Low Confidence] SDQ and APT campaigns are
a single actor. That said, it is conceivable that the
11 clusters of activity, previously believed to be
independent campaigns run by different actors,
are in fact one cluster of activity run by one
well-resourced actor. However, we believe this
scenario is less likely because each cluster of
activity utilized malware samples with different
artifacts such as passwords, campaign identifiers,
and mutexes. These artifacts were generally
consistent within each cluster of activity but
differed across clusters.

29 www.fireeye.com

[Medium Confidence] SDQ does not exist, and
APT actors informally share among each other.
Alternatively, different actors might be
responsible for the documented 11 clusters of
activity and instead of relying on a centralized
development and logistics operation, these
actors share TTPs through formal or informal
channels.
In each of these scenarios, a shared development
and logistics infrastructure or some notion of a
digital quartermaster clearly underpins all of the
activity presented in this report. Whether this
quartermaster involves informal connections
between developers or a structured bureaucratic
organization serving a central offensive
apparatus is unclear. Regardless of the scenario,
the overall finding of a shared development and
logistics infrastructure suggests targeted
organizations are facing a more organized
menace than they realize.

About FireEye
FireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual
machine-based security platform that provides
real-time threat protection to enterprises and
governments worldwide against the next
generation of cyber attacks. These highly
sophisticated cyber attacks easily circumvent
traditional signature-based defenses, such as
next-generation firewalls, IPS, anti-virus, and
gateways. The FireEye Threat Prevention
Platform provides real-time, dynamic threat

protection without the use of signatures to
protect an organization across the primary threat
vectors, including mobile, Web, email, and files and
across the different stages of an attack life cycle.
The core of the FireEye platform is a virtual
execution engine, complemented by dynamic
threat intelligence, to identify and block cyber
attacks in real time. FireEye has over 1,100
customers across more than 40 countries,
including over 100 of the Fortune 500.
