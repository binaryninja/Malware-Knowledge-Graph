Investigation: WannaCry
cyber attack and the NHS

HC 414 SESSION 2017–2019

27 OCTOBER 2017

Our vision is to help the nation spend wisely.
Our public audit perspective helps Parliament hold
government to account and improve public services.

The National Audit Office scrutinises public spending for Parliament and is independent
of government. The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), Sir Amyas Morse KCB,
is an Officer of the House of Commons and leads the NAO. The C&AG certifies the
accounts of all government departments and many other public sector bodies. He has
statutory authority to examine and report to Parliament on whether departments and
the bodies they fund have used their resources efficiently, effectively, and with economy.
Our studies evaluate the value for money of public spending, nationally and locally.
Our recommendations and reports on good practice help government improve public
services, and our work led to audited savings of £734 million in 2016.

4 What this investigation is about Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

What this investigation is about

1
On Friday 12 May 2017 a global ransomware attack, known as WannaCry, affected
more than 200,000 computers in at least 100 countries. In the UK, the attack particularly
affected the NHS, although it was not the specific target. At 4 pm on 12 May, NHS England
declared the cyber attack a major incident and implemented its emergency arrangements
to maintain health and patient care. On the evening of 12 May a cyber‑security researcher
activated a kill-switch so that WannaCry stopped locking devices.
2
According to NHS England, the WannaCry ransomware affected at least 81 out of
the 236 trusts across England, because they were either infected by the ransomware or
turned off their devices or systems as a precaution. A further 603 primary care and other
NHS organisations were also infected, including 595 GP practices.
3
Before the WannaCry attack the Department of Health (the Department) and its
arm’s-length bodies had work under way to strengthen cyber-security in the NHS. For
example, NHS Digital was broadcasting alerts about cyber threats, providing a hotline
for dealing with incidents, sharing best practice and carrying out on-site assessments to
help protect against future cyber attacks; and NHS England had embedded the 10 Data
Security Standards (recommended by the National Data Guardian) in the standard NHS
contract for 2017-18 and was providing training to its Board and local teams to raise
awareness of cyber threats. In light of the WannaCry attack, the Department announced
further plans to strengthen NHS organisations’ cyber-security.
4
Our investigation focuses on events immediately before 12 May 2017 and up
until 30 September 2017. We only cover the effect the WannaCry attack had on the
NHS in England. We do not cover how the WannaCry attack affected other countries
or organisations outside the NHS. A cyber attack on either the health or social care
sectors could cause disruption across the whole health and social care sector. For
example, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) told us that, as some trusts were unable
to communicate with social services, there could have been delays in the discharge
of patients from hospital to social care, although the CQC relayed advice from NHS
Digital and NHS England to social care providers to help manage any disruption.
This investigation sets out the facts about:

•

the ransomware attack’s impact on the NHS and its patients;

•

why some parts of the NHS were affected; and

•

how the Department and NHS national bodies responded to the attack.

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Summary 5

Summary

1
The WannaCry attack affected NHS services in the week from 12 May to
19 May 2017. The Department of Health (the Department) and NHS England worked with
NHS Digital, NHS Improvement, the National Cyber Security Centre, the National Crime
Agency and others to respond to the attack.

Key findings
The risk of a cyber attack affecting the NHS
2
WannaCry was the largest cyber attack to affect the NHS, although individual
trusts had been attacked before 12 May 2017. For example, two of the trusts infected
by WannaCry had been infected by previous cyber attacks. One of England’s biggest
trusts, Barts Health NHS Trust, had been infected before, and Northern Lincolnshire and
Goole NHS Foundation Trust had been subject to a ransomware attack in October 2016,
leading to the cancellation of 2,800 appointments (paragraph 3.7 and Figure 5).
3
The Department was warned about the risks of cyber attacks on the
NHS a year before WannaCry and although it had work under way it did not
formally respond with a written report until July 2017. The Secretary of State for
Health asked the National Data Guardian and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to
undertake reviews of data security. These reports were published in July 2016 and
warned the Department that cyber attacks could lead to patient information being
lost or compromised and jeopardise access to critical patient record systems. They
recommended that all health and care organisations needed to provide evidence that
they were taking action to improve cyber-security, including moving off old operating
systems. Although the Department and its arm’s-length bodies had work under way to
improve cyber-security in the NHS, the Department did not publish its formal response
to the recommendations until July 2017 (paragraphs 3.6 and 3.11).

6 Summary Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

4
The Department and its arm’s-length bodies did not know whether local NHS
organisations were prepared for a cyber attack. Local healthcare organisations such
as trusts and clinical commissioning groups are responsible for keeping the information
they hold secure, and for having arrangements in place to respond to an incident or
emergency, including a cyber attack. Local healthcare bodies are overseen by the
Department and its arm’s-length bodies. The Department and Cabinet Office wrote to
trusts in 2014, saying it was essential they had “robust plans” to migrate away from old
software, such as Windows XP, by April 2015. In March and April 2017, NHS Digital had
issued critical alerts warning organisations to patch their systems to prevent WannaCry.
However, before 12 May 2017, the Department had no formal mechanism for assessing
whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance. Prior to the
attack, NHS Digital had conducted an on-site cyber-security assessment for 88 out of
236 trusts, and none had passed. However, NHS Digital cannot mandate a local body
to take remedial action even if it has concerns about the vulnerability of an organisation
(paragraphs 2.5, 2.7, 2.10 to 2.12 and 3.2, and Figure 4).

How the WannaCry attack affected the NHS
5
The attack led to disruption in at least 34% of trusts in England although
the Department and NHS England do not know the full extent of the disruption
(Figure 1). On 12 May, NHS England initially identified 45 NHS organisations including
37 trusts that had been infected by the WannaCry ransomware. Over the following days,
more organisations reported they had been affected. In total, at least 81 out of 236
trusts across England were affected. The trusts included:

•

37 infected and locked out of devices (of which, 27 were acute trusts); and

•

44 not infected but reporting disruption. For example, these trusts shut down their
email and other systems as a precaution and on their own initiative, as they had not
received central advice early enough on 12 May to inform their decisions on what
to do. This meant, for example, that they had to use pen and paper for activities
usually performed electronically.

NHS England and NHS Digital identified a further 21 trusts that were attempting to
contact the WannaCry domain, but were not locked out of their devices. There are two
possible reasons for this. Trusts may have become infected after the kill-switch had been
activated, and were therefore not locked out of their devices. Alternatively, they may have
contacted the WannaCry domain as part of their cyber-security activity.
A further 603 primary care and other NHS organisations were infected by WannaCry,
including 595 GP practices. However, the Department does not know how many NHS
organisations could not access records or receive information, because they shared
data or systems with an infected trust. NHS Digital told us that it believes no patient data
were compromised or stolen (paragraphs 1.2 to 1.5 and 1.9, and Figure 1).

Some of the trusts identified as not infected but reporting disruption did have a small number of devices infected. However, they did not report themselves to NHS England as
infected, and NHS England did not recategorise them as being infected after the WannaCry attack was over.

Some trusts, GP practices and other organisations were identified as having systems that attempted to contact the WannaCry domain, but were not locked out of their devices.
There are two possible explanations for this: they could have become infected after the kill-switch had been activated. Or, they could have avoided infection but contacted the
WannaCry domain as part of their cyber-security activity. NHS England does not know which organisations fall into each category.

8 Summary Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

6
Thousands of appointments and operations were cancelled and in five
areas patients had to travel further to accident and emergency departments.
Between 12 May and 18 May, NHS England collected some information on cancelled
appointments, to help it manage the incident, but this did not include all types of
appointment. NHS England identified 6,912 appointments had been cancelled, and
estimated more than 19,000 appointments would have been cancelled in total, based
on the normal rate of follow‑up appointments to first appointments. NHS England told
us it does not plan to identify the actual number because it is focusing its efforts on
responding appropriately to the lessons learned from WannaCry. As data were not
collected during the incident, neither the Department nor NHS England know how many
GP appointments were cancelled, or how many ambulances and patients were diverted
from the five accident and emergency departments that were unable to treat some
patients (paragraphs 1.7, 1.8 and 1.10, and Figure 1).
7
The Department, NHS England and the National Crime Agency told us that
no NHS organisation paid the ransom, but the Department does not know how
much the disruption to services cost the NHS. The Department, NHS England and
the National Crime Agency told us no NHS organisation paid the ransom. NHS Digital
told us it advised the trusts it spoke to not to pay the ransom, and wrote to all trusts on
14 May advising against the payment of ransoms. The Department does not know the
cost of the disruption to services. Costs include: cancelled appointments; additional IT
support provided by local NHS bodies, or IT consultants; or the cost of restoring data and
systems affected by the attack. National and local NHS staff worked overtime including
over the weekend of 13-14 May to resolve problems and to prevent a fresh wave of
organisations being affected by WannaCry on Monday 15 May (paragraphs 1.11 and 1.12).
8
The cyber attack could have caused more disruption if it had not been
stopped by a cyber researcher activating a ‘kill-switch’. On the evening of 12 May
a cyber-security researcher activated a ‘kill-switch’ so that WannaCry stopped locking
devices. This meant that some NHS organisations had been infected by the WannaCry
ransomware, but because of the researcher’s actions, they were not locked out of
their devices and systems. Between 15 May and mid-September NHS Digital and
NHS England identified a further 92 organisations, including 21 trusts, as contacting
the WannaCry domain, although some of these may have been contacting the
domain as part of their cyber-security activity. Of the 37 trusts infected and locked
out of devices, 32 were located in the North NHS region and the Midlands and East
NHS region. NHS England believes more organisations were infected in these regions
because they were hit early on 12 May before the WannaCry ‘kill-switch’ was activated
(paragraphs 1.14 and 2.2, and Figure 3).

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Summary 9

The NHS response to the attack
9
The Department had developed a plan, which included roles and
responsibilities of national and local organisations for responding to an attack,
but had not tested the plan at a local level. This meant the NHS was not clear what
actions it should take when affected by WannaCry. NHS England found that responding
to WannaCry was different from dealing with other incidents, such as a major transport
accident. Because WannaCry was different it took more time to determine the cause
of the problem, the scale of the problem and the number of organisations and people
affected (paragraph 3.3 and Figure 2).
10 As the NHS had not rehearsed for a national cyber attack it was not
immediately clear who should lead the response and there were problems with
communications. The WannaCry attack began on the morning of 12 May. At 4 pm
NHS England declared the cyber attack a major incident and at 6:45 pm initiated
its existing Emergency, Preparedness, Resilience and Response plans to act as the
single point of coordination for incident management, with support from NHS Digital
and NHS Improvement. In the absence of clear guidelines on responding to a national
cyber attack, local organisations reported the attack to different organisations within
and outside the health sector, including local police. Communication was difficult in
the early stages of the attack as many local organisations could not communicate with
national NHS bodies by email as they had been infected by WannaCry or had shut down
their email systems as a precaution, although NHS Improvement did communicate
with trusts’ chief executive officers by telephone. Locally, NHS staff shared information
through personal mobile devices, including using the encrypted WhatsApp application.
Although not an official communication channel, national bodies and trusts told us it
worked well during this incident (paragraphs 3.3 to 3.5 and Figure 2).
11 In line with its existing procedures for managing a major incident, NHS
England initially focused on maintaining emergency care. Since the attack occurred
on a Friday this caused minimal disruption to primary care services, which tend to
be closed over the weekend. Twenty-two of the 27 infected acute trusts managed to
continue treating urgent and emergency patients throughout the weekend. However,
five – in London, Essex, Hertfordshire, Hampshire and Cumbria – had to divert patients
to other accident and emergency departments, and a further two needed outside help
to continue treating patients. By 16 May only two hospitals were still diverting patients.
The recovery was helped by the work of the cyber-security researcher that stopped
WannaCry spreading (paragraphs 1.7, 1.13 and 1.14).

10 Summary Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

Lessons learned
12 NHS Digital told us that all organisations infected by WannaCry shared
the same vulnerability and could have taken relatively simple action to protect
themselves. All NHS organisations infected by WannaCry had unpatched or
unsupported Windows operating systems so were susceptible to the ransomware.
However, whether organisations had patched their systems or not, taking action
to manage their firewalls facing the internet would have guarded organisations
against infection. NHS Digital told us that the majority of NHS devices infected were
unpatched but on supported Microsoft Windows 7 operating systems. Unsupported
devices (those on XP) were in the minority of identified issues. NHS Digital has also
confirmed that the ransomware spread via the internet, including through the N3
network (the broadband network connecting all NHS sites in England), but that there
were no instances of the ransomware spreading via NHSmail (the NHS email system)
(paragraphs 1.2, 1.6 and 2.4 to 2.6).
13 There was no clear relationship between vulnerability to the WannaCry
attack and leadership in trusts. We found no clear relationship between trusts
infected by WannaCry and the quality of their leadership, as rated by the Care Quality
Commission (paragraph 2.8).
14 The NHS has accepted that there are lessons to learn from WannaCry and
is taking action. Lessons identified by the Department and NHS national bodies
include the need to:

•

develop a response plan setting out what the NHS should do in the event of a
cyber attack and establish the roles and responsibilities of local and national
NHS bodies and the Department;

•

ensure organisations implement critical CareCERT alerts (emails sent by
NHS Digital providing information or requiring action), including applying
software patches and keeping anti-virus software up to date;

•

ensure essential communications are getting through during an attack
when systems are down; and

•

ensure that organisations, boards and their staff are taking the cyber threat
seriously, understand the direct risks to front-line services and are working
proactively to maximise their resilience and minimise impacts on patient care.

Since WannaCry, NHS England and NHS Improvement have written to every trust,
clinical commissioning group and commissioning support unit asking boards to
ensure that they have implemented all 39 CareCERT alerts issued by NHS Digital
between March and May 2017 and taken essential action to secure local firewalls
(paragraphs 3.8 and 3.9).

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Part One 11

Part One

The impact of the cyber attack
1.1 WannaCry was the largest ever cyber attack to affect the NHS in England.
The timeline of the main events relating to the WannaCry ransomware attack which affected
NHS services in the week from 12 May to 19 May 2017 is set out in Figure 2 overleaf.

The scale of the attack
1.2 NHS Digital told us that the ransomware spread via the internet, including through
the N3 network. As shown in Figure 1 (page 7), the WannaCry ransomware attack
affected at least 81 out of 236 trusts across England. These numbers are based on
NHS organisations’ own reports to NHS England. Of these 81 trusts, there were:

•

37 trusts infected and locked out of devices (of which, 27 were acute trusts); and

•

44 trusts not infected but reporting disruption.

NHS England and NHS Digital identified a further 21 trusts that were attempting to
contact the WannaCry domain, but were not locked out of their devices. There are two
possible reasons for this. Trusts may have become infected after the kill-switch had been
activated, and were therefore not locked out of their devices.1 Alternatively, they may
have contacted the WannaCry domain as part of their cyber-security activity.
1.3 The trusts infected by the WannaCry ransomware experienced two main types of
disruption including:

•

NHS staff being locked out of devices, which prevented or delayed staff accessing
and updating patient information, sending test results to patients’ GPs and
transferring or discharging patients from hospital; and

•

medical equipment and devices being locked, or isolated from trusts’ IT systems to
prevent them being locked. This meant trusts’ radiology and pathology departments
were disrupted as the trusts relied on the equipment and devices for diagnostic
imaging (such as MRI scanners) and for testing blood and tissue samples.

A ‘kill-switch’ is a mechanism that is incorporated into software to shut down that software, or the device on which it
sits, in an emergency situation in which it cannot be shut down in the usual manner.

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Part One 13

As at 19 May 2017, NHS England had identified 1,220 pieces of diagnostic equipment
that had been infected, 1% of all such NHS equipment. Although a relatively small
proportion of devices, the figure does not include devices disconnected from IT systems
to prevent infection. The trusts we spoke to told us about the disruption they had
experienced due to diagnostic equipment being infected or isolated, such as not being
able to send MRI scan results to clinicians treating patients in other parts of the hospital.
1.4 The disruption at trusts not infected by the ransomware was caused by:

•

the absence of timely central direction, leading to the trusts taking actions on their
own initiative to avoid becoming infected, including shutting down devices or isolating
devices from their networks to protect themselves from the ransomware; or

•

trusts not being able to access electronic patient records or receive information,
such as test results, because they shared data or systems with an infected trust
which had shut down its systems; or

•

trusts disconnecting from the N3 network, the broadband network connecting all
NHS sites in England.

1.5 The disruption at these trusts took a number of forms. For example, some trusts
had to use manual workarounds to perform their usual tasks, such as providing
medication to patients, and record information using pen and paper. In addition,
organisations could not receive external emails, so communication with national bodies
and others outside their trust was severely limited.
1.6 Despite widespread local disruption, NHS Digital told us that national NHS IT
systems managed by NHS Digital were not infected, such as the NHS Spine (a service
holding secure databases of demographic and clinical information) and NHSmail
(the NHS email system).
1.7 Of the 27 acute trusts infected and locked out of devices, five had to divert
emergency ambulance services to other hospitals. The five trusts and hospitals were:

•

Barts Health NHS Trust (Royal London Hospital);

•

Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust (Broomfield Hospital);

•

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust (Lister Hospital);

•

Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Basingstoke Hospital); and

•

North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (West Cumberland Hospital).

14 Part One Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

The impact on patients
1.8 As infected NHS organisations could not access important information and
electronic systems, including patient records, they had to cancel appointments and
operations and some trusts had to divert patients to other accident and emergency
departments. Between 12 May and 18 May, NHS England collected some information
on how many appointments had been cancelled to help it manage the incident, but
did not collect data on all types of appointment. NHS England identified that the NHS
had cancelled 6,912 appointments, but this figure does not include repeat outpatient
appointments and cancellations identified after 18 May. NHS England estimated the total
number of cancelled appointments as being around 19,494, based on the normal rate
of follow-up appointments to first appointments, but told us it does not plan to identify
the actual number because it is focusing its efforts on responding appropriately to the
lessons learned from WannaCry. NHS England did not collect data on how many GP
appointments were cancelled or how many ambulances and patients were diverted from
the accident and emergency departments that were unable to treat patients.
1.9 NHS organisations did not report any cases of harm to patients or of data being
compromised or stolen. If the WannaCry ransomware attack had led to any patient harm
or loss of data then NHS England told us that it would expect trusts to report cases
through existing reporting channels, such as reporting data loss direct to the Information
Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in line with existing policy and guidance on information
governance. NHS Digital also told us that analysis of the WannaCry ransomware
suggested that the cyber attack was not aimed at accessing or stealing data, although
it does not know for certain that this is the case.
1.10 The NHS continued to provide emergency care from 12 May to 19 May, although
some patients had to travel further as five hospitals had diverted services (paragraph 1.7).
Patients with planned appointments experienced most disruption. Cancer charities,
including Macmillan Cancer Support and Cancer Research UK, reported cancellations
causing distress to patients. NHS England’s own review identified at least 139 patients
who had an urgent referral for potential cancer cancelled, as at 18 May, although the
actual number may be higher if trusts misreported during the data collection or identified
cancellations after 18 May.

The financial impact
1.11 The Department of Health (the Department), NHS England and the National Crime
Agency have told us that no NHS organisations paid the ransom. NHS Digital told us it
advised against the payment of the WannaCry ransom during site visits and telephone
conferences with infected trusts. Furthermore, NHS England and NHS Digital wrote to
all trusts on 14 May advising them against the payment of ransoms, but these emails
did not always reach trusts after that attack had begun.

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Part One 15

1.12 The NHS has not calculated the total cost of cancelled appointments; of NHS staff
overtime; of additional IT support provided by NHS local bodies or IT consultants; or the
cost of restoring data and systems affected by the attack. For example, trusts and other
NHS organisations had to roll back systems and restore data and systems, including
re-entering data recorded manually while trusts’ systems were down. National and local
NHS staff had to work overtime, including over the weekend of 13–14 May, to resolve
problems and to prevent a fresh wave of organisations being affected by WannaCry
on Monday 15 May.

The recovery
1.13 In line with its established procedures for responding to a major incident, NHS
England focused its initial response on maintaining emergency care, and within 24 hours
began attending to primary care. Since the attack occurred on a Friday it caused
minimal disruption to primary care services, which tend to be closed over the weekend.
Twenty-two of the 27 infected acute trusts continued treating urgent and emergency
patients throughout the weekend. However, five trusts, including Barts Health NHS
Trust, were unable to see some patients and had to divert them to other hospitals, and
a further two needed outside help to continue treating patients. NHS England worked
with trusts to ensure diverts were put in place and help provided. By Tuesday 16 May,
only two hospitals were still diverting patients: Lister Hospital in Hertfordshire and
Broomfield Hospital in Essex. NHS England ‘stood down’ the incident on Friday 19 May.
1.14 The recovery was aided by the work of a cyber-security researcher who activated
a kill-switch so that WannaCry stopped locking devices. The researcher triggered the
kill-switch on the evening of Friday 12 May. This meant that some NHS organisations
were infected by the WannaCry malware, but because of the actions of the researcher
they were not locked out of their devices and systems. Between 15 May and
mid‑September, NHS Digital and NHS England identified a further 92 organisations,
including 21 trusts, attempting to contact the WannaCry domain, in addition to the initial
45 organisations they had identified as being infected. Although some of these trusts
may have contacted the WannaCry domain as part of their cyber-security activity.

Part Two

Why some parts of the NHS were affected
2.1 NHS organisations across England were affected by the WannaCry attack.
Figure 3 sets out the location of the trusts affected and shows the:

•

37 trusts infected by the WannaCry malware; and

•

44 trusts not infected by the malware but reporting disruption.

2.2 Of the 37 trusts infected, 32 were located in the North NHS region and the
Midlands and East NHS region. NHS England believes more organisations were infected
in these regions because they were hit early on 12 May before the WannaCry kill-switch
was activated.

Failure to patch and update systems and reliance on old software
2.3 It is not possible to eliminate all cyber threats but organisations can prevent harm
through good cyber-security. Such practice includes maintaining up-to-date firewalls and
anti-virus software, and applying patches (updates) in a timely manner. NHS England’s
view is that WannaCry infected some parts of the NHS mainly because organisations
had failed to maintain good cyber-security practices.
2.4 NHS Digital told us that all the infected trusts had a common vulnerability in their
Windows operating systems which was exploited by the WannaCry attack. All NHS
organisations infected by WannaCry had unpatched, or unsupported, Windows
operating systems. However, whether organisations had patched their systems or
not, taking action to manage their firewalls facing the internet would have guarded
the organisations against infection.

Note
1 NHS England believes the concentration of infected trusts in the North NHS region and the Midlands and East NHS
region does not reflect variations in cyber-security, but may be partially explained by these organisations becoming
infected earlier in the day, before the WannaCry ‘kill-switch’ was activated.

18 Part Two Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

2.5 NHS Digital told us that the majority of NHS devices infected were unpatched but
on the supported Windows 7 operating system. Trusts using Windows 7 could have
protected themselves against WannaCry by applying a patch (or update) issued by
Microsoft in March 2017, and NHS Digital had issued CareCERT alerts on 17 March and
28 April asking trusts to apply the patch.2 According to the Department of Health (the
Department), more than 90% of devices in the NHS use the Windows 7 operating system.
2.6 A second issue was that some trusts were running the older Windows XP
operating system on some devices. This made the trusts vulnerable because Microsoft
was no longer releasing patches for this operating system, and so they could not
protect their systems from WannaCry unless they isolated those devices from the
network. Some trusts also experienced issues with some medical equipment, such
as MRI scanners that have Windows XP embedded within them (see paragraph 1.3).
This equipment is generally managed by the system vendors and local trusts are not
capable of applying updates themselves. Support from the vendors of these devices
was often poor according to NHS England and NHS Digital. However, trusts running
Windows XP on their medical equipment could have protected themselves by isolating
these devices from the rest of the network (although this may necessitate manual
workarounds). In July 2017, as part of its response to the National Data Guardian review,
the Department told local bodies to ensure that they had moved away from, or were
actively managing, unsupported software by April 2018.
2.7 The Department and Cabinet Office had written to trusts in 2014 offering some
temporary help with security for old equipment until April 2015, after which time there
would be no support. This meant that it was essential that all NHS organisations had
“robust plans” to migrate away from Windows XP. Despite this, the Department told
us about 5% of the NHS IT estate, including computers and medical equipment, was
still using Windows XP on 12 May 2017. This is partly explained by the fact that it is not
always possible to remove or update Windows XP in applications and IT services based
on that operating system. Immediately after the WannaCry attack Microsoft issued a
patch for Windows XP that would prevent WannaCry and similar ransomware.

Leadership and size of trusts
2.8 We found no clear relationship between those trusts infected by WannaCry and
the quality of their leadership, as rated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Of the
37 trusts infected by WannaCry, four (11%) had been rated as ‘inadequate’ against the
‘well-led’ domain at their last CQC inspection, compared with 7% of NHS organisations
not infected.3 However, CQC had not focused on how well led trusts were in relation to
cyber-security in their inspections before 12 May 2017. We understand CQC has plans
to enhance its line of questions regarding information and digital systems as part of
its inspection of the leadership of trusts in the future.

A CareCERT alert is an email sent by NHS Digital providing information or requiring action from NHS organisations.
Of the 37 trusts infected by WannaCry, 36 had a CQC rating.

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Part Two 19

2.9 We also found that infected trusts tended to employ more staff than average.
Of the 37 infected trusts:

•

14 (38%) were among the 25% of trusts employing the most staff; and

•

26 (70%) employed more than the median number of staff.

Although there is limited evidence on why this should be the case, we found that:

•

some of the trusts we spoke to told us that integrating IT systems when trusts
merge (and become larger) and running many different versions of Windows
operating systems, not all of which are supported, can be a challenge; and

•

WannaCry exploited weaknesses within parts of Microsoft’s Windows operating
system used to share files within organisations. This meant it spread automatically
in some cases, and organisations with large Windows networks were among the
worst affected.

Prepared for a cyber attack
2.10 Before 12 May, the Department and its arm’s-length bodies did not know whether
trusts had complied with CareCERT alerts as no formal mechanism of assessment
existed at that time. On 12 May, NHS Digital worked with NHS England to put in place
a formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with
CareCERT alerts. Emergency, Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) teams
requested a positive return from providers by midnight on 12 May that, for example
where they had:

•

not been subject to an attack, they had implemented the patch; and

•

been subject to an attack, they had implemented remedial works; had been
able to roll back their systems; and could continue to provide emergency
services or – if not – had put mitigations in place.

2.11 Before the WannaCry attack, NHS Digital offered an on-site inspection to hospitals
to assess their cyber-security (known as ‘CareCERT Assure’). This inspection was
voluntary. By 12 May, NHS Digital had inspected 88 out of 236 trusts and none had
passed. NHS Digital’s review of the WannaCry attack concluded that CareCERT
advice and guidance (including inspections) was mostly followed by organisations with
relatively mature cyber‑security arrangements, while vulnerable trusts were not taking
action to improve their security. NHS Digital also found that, in general, trusts had
not identified cyber-security as being a risk to patient outcomes, and had tended to
overestimate their readiness to manage a cyber attack. NHS Digital believes this reflects
a lack of understanding of the nature of cyber risk among trusts, rather than a neglect
of cyber‑security.

20 Part Two Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

2.12 The Department and its arm’s-length bodies did not hold information on how
prepared local organisations were to respond to a cyber attack, such as whether
cyber-security appeared on organisations’ risk registers or whether trusts complied with
good practice. The Department and its arm’s-length bodies also had limited central
information on trusts’ IT and digital assets such as anti-virus software and IP addresses.
At the start of its investigation, the National Crime Agency had to gather evidence from
all sites, including information on the devices affected, IP addresses and network traffic,
to assess the impact of WannaCry on the NHS, rather than being able to access the
information centrally.

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Part Three 21

Part Three

How the Department and the NHS responded
Devolved responsibility for cyber-security
3.1 The Department of Health (the Department) has overall national responsibility for
cyber-security resilience and responding to incidents in the health sector. However, the
Department devolves responsibility for managing cyber-security to local organisations –
NHS trusts, GPs, clinical commissioning groups and social care providers. Regulators
and other national bodies oversee and support local NHS organisations. While NHS
foundation trusts are directly accountable to Parliament for delivering healthcare services,
they are held to account by the same regulators as NHS trusts. Roles and responsibilities
for cyber-security as at September 2017 are set out in Figure 4 on pages 22 and 23.
In particular:

•

NHS Improvement holds trusts and NHS foundation trusts to account for
delivering value for money; and

•

the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulates health and social care providers
for safety and quality of their services.

3.2 Both bodies can mandate local NHS organisations to improve their performance.
They also have a role in ensuring that local bodies have appropriate cyber-security
arrangements, but neither are primarily concerned with cyber or information technology
issues. NHS Digital provides guidance, alerts and support to local organisations on
cyber-security, and can visit organisations to evaluate cyber-security arrangements if
asked to do so, as part of CareCERT Assure.4 However, NHS Digital cannot mandate
a local body to take remedial action even if it has concerns about the vulnerability of
that organisation.

4

Prior to the WannaCry attack, NHS Digital offered an on-site inspection to hospitals to assess their cyber-security.
This was known as ‘CareCERT Assure’ and was voluntary. NHS national bodies are currently revising this system.

24 Part Three Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

How the cyber attack was managed
3.3 Before the WannaCry attack the Department had developed a plan for responding
to a cyber attack, which included roles and responsibilities of national and local
organisations. However, the Department had not tested the plan at a local level. This
meant the NHS was not clear what actions it should take when affected by WannaCry,
including how it should respond at a local level. On 12 May 2017, NHS England
determined that it should declare a national major incident and decided that it would
lead the response, coordinating with NHS Digital and NHS Improvement. NHS England
treated the attack as a major operational incident through its existing Emergency
Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) processes. However, as NHS England
had not rehearsed its response to a cyber attack it faced a number of challenges. The
cyber attack was less visible than other types of incident and not confined to local areas
or regions in the way a major transport accident would have been, for example. This
meant that it took more time to determine the cause of the problem, the scale of the
problem and the number of people and organisations affected.
3.4 Without clear guidelines on responding to a national cyber attack, organisations
reported the attack to different sources including the local police, NHS England and
NHS Digital. For the same reason communications to patients and local organisations
also came from a number of sources. These included the National Cyber Security
Centre, which was providing support to all UK organisations affected by the attack,
NHS England and NHS Digital. In addition, the use of email for communication was
limited, although NHS Improvement did communicate with trusts’ chief executive officers
by telephone. Affected trusts shut down IT systems, including some trusts disconnecting
from NHS email and the N3 network as a precautionary measure.5 The Department
coordinated the response with the centre of government, briefing ministers, liaising
with the National Cyber Security Centre and National Crime Agency, and overseeing
NHS England’s and NHS Digital’s operational response.
3.5 Affected trusts were triaged through the EPRR route and, where necessary,
received assistance from national bodies, including advice and physical technical
support from NHS Digital, which sent 54 staff out to hospitals to provide direct support.
Staff at the Department, NHS England, NHS Improvement and NHS Digital, as well
as large numbers of staff in other organisations across the NHS, worked through the
weekend to resolve the problem and avoid further problems on Monday. NHS England’s
IT team did not have on-call arrangements in place, but staff came in voluntarily to help
resolve the issue. Front-line NHS staff adapted to communication challenges and shared
information through personal mobile devices, including using the encrypted WhatsApp
application. NHS national bodies and trusts told us that this worked well on the day
although is not an official communication channel.

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Part Three 25

The risk of a cyber attack had been identified before WannaCry
3.6 The Secretary of State for Health asked the National Data Guardian and CQC
to undertake reviews of data security. These reports were published in July 2016 and
warned the Department about the cyber threat and the need for the Department to
respond to it. They noted the threat of cyber attacks not only put patient information
at risk of loss or compromise but also jeopardised access to critical patient record
systems by clinicians. They recommended that all health and care organisations needed
to provide evidence that they were taking action to improve cyber-security, such as
through the ‘Cyber Essentials’ scheme.6
3.7 Although WannaCry was the largest cyber-security incident to affect the
NHS, individual NHS organisations had been victims of other attacks in recent
years (Figure 5 overleaf). WannaCry infected one of England’s biggest trusts, Barts
Health NHS Trust. This was the second cyber attack to affect the trust in six months.
A ransomware attack had also affected Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation
Trust in October 2016, which had led to it cancelling 2,800 appointments.

Lessons learned
3.8 The NHS has accepted that there are lessons to learn from WannaCry and is
already taking action. The NHS has identified the need to improve the protection of
services from future cyber attacks. These include the need to:

•

develop a response plan setting out what the NHS should do in the event of a
cyber attack and establish the roles and responsibilities of local and national
NHS bodies and the Department;

•

ensure organisations implement critical CareCERT alerts, including applying
software patches and keeping anti-virus software up to date and identifying;

•

ensure essential communications are getting through during an incident
when systems are down; and

•

ensure that organisations, boards and their staff are taking the cyber threat
seriously, understand the direct risks to front-line services and are working
proactively to maximise their resilience and minimise the impact on patient care.

3.9 Following the WannaCry attack, NHS England and NHS Improvement wrote to
every trust, clinical commissioning group and commissioning support unit asking boards
to ensure that they had implemented all 39 CareCERT alerts issued by NHS Digital
between March and May 2017 and had taken essential action to secure local firewalls.

Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS Part Three 27

3.10 NHS England and NHS Improvement are talking to every major trauma centre
and ambulance trust, and will reprioritise £21 million in capital funding from existing
IT budgets to improve cyber-security in major trauma centres. NHS Digital has built a
new CareCERT Collect portal to provide assurance that trusts have implemented cyber
alerts and to collect central data on IT and digital assets in the NHS. Since 2015, the
Department has made £50 million available to provide central support to the health and
care system through the CareCERT suite of services.
3.11 Following the WannaCry attack, in July 2017 the Department published its
response to the National Data Guardian and CQC recommendations. The response built
on existing work to strengthen cyber-security in the NHS, involving the Department and
its arm’s-length bodies. For example, NHS Digital was developing its existing services to
support local organisations, including broadcasting alerts about cyber threats, providing
a hotline for dealing with incidents, sharing best practice across the health system and
carrying out on-site assessments to help protect against future cyber attacks; and
NHS England had embedded the 10 Data Security Standards, recommended by the
National Data Guardian, in the standard NHS contract for 2017-18, and was providing
training to its Board and local teams to raise awareness of cyber threats. The Department
also told us that a revised version of the Information Governance Toolkit is being developed
for use in 2018-19, and that the inspection framework used by the CQC will be updated to
incorporate the data standards.7

The Information Governance Toolkit draws together the legal rules and central guidance issued by the Department
of Health, and presents them in a single standard as a set of information governance requirements. All health and
social care providers, commissioners and suppliers are required to carry out self-assessments of their compliance
against these requirements. The Toolkit is commissioned by the Department and is maintained by NHS Digital.

28 Appendix One Investigation: WannaCry cyber attack and the NHS

Appendix One

Our investigative approach
Scope

We conducted an investigation into the WannaCry cyber attack that affected
the NHS in England on 12 May 2017. We investigated:

•

the WannaCry attack’s impact on the NHS and its patients;

•

why some parts of the NHS were affected; and

•

how the Department, NHS national bodies (NHS England, NHS Digital and
NHS Improvement) and other national bodies, such as the National Cyber
Security Centre and National Crime Agency, responded to the incident.

Methods
2

In examining the issues in paragraph one, we drew on a variety of evidence sources.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with officials from:

•

Department of Health

•

NHS England

•

NHS Digital

•

NHS Improvement

•

Care Quality Commission

•

National Cyber Security Centre

We visited four local trusts to examine their roles and responsibilities in relation to
cyber-security; the impact of WannaCry on the trust and its patients; and how the trust
responded to the incident:

•

Barts Health NHS Trust;

•

Bedford Hospital NHS Trust;

•

Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust; and

•

the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.

5
We reviewed documents relating to the WannaCry ransomware attack including
documents setting out roles and responsibilities for cyber-security in the NHS and
across the wider public sector. We also reviewed published and unpublished research
and reports relating to the NHS and WannaCry and cyber-security more generally.
6
We carried out analysis of data provided by NHS England, NHS Digital and the
Care Quality Commission.
