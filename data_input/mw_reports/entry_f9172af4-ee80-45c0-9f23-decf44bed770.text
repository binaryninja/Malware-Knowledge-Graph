Office furniture giant Steelcase has suffered a ransomware attack that forced them to shut
down their network to contain the attack's spread.
Steelcase is the largest office furniture manufacturer globally, with 13,000 employees and
$3.7 billion in 2020.

Steelcase suffers a Ryuk ransomware attack
In an 8-K form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Steelcase has
disclosed that they were the victim of a cyberattack on October 22nd, 2020.
On October 22, 2020, Steelcase Inc. (the “Company”) detected a cyberattack on its
information technology systems. The Company promptly implemented a series of
containment measures to address this situation including temporarily shutting down the
affected systems and related operations.

The Company is actively engaged in restoring the affected systems and returning to normal
levels of operations. At this time, the Company is not aware of any data loss from its
systems or any other loss of assets as a result of this attack. Although cyberattacks can be
unpredictable, the Company does not currently expect this incident will have a material
impact on its business operations or its financial results.
BleepingComputer has been actively tracking this attack after a source in the cybersecurity
industry told us last week that Steelcase suffered a Ryuk ransomware attack.
We were told that Steelcase's devices were encrypted by Ryuk after first being targeted by
the same group behind the recent attack on Sopra Steria and Universal Health Services.
If you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can
confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.
Those attacks utilized either the BazarLoader or TrickBot infections, which ultimately
provide remote access to the Ryuk Ransomware threat actors, who then compromise the
rest of the network and deploy Ryuk.

It is unknown how many devices were encrypted or if business operations were impacted
other than the shutting down of the network.
BleepingComputer has contacted Steelcase with further questions but has not heard back.
