Threat Analysis Group

Threat Analysis Group’s (TAG) mission is to understand and counter serious threats,
including actors engaged in coordinated information operations (IO). Today, in connection
with the release of the TAG Bulletin, we are sharing year-in-review insights for 2022 about
DRAGONBRIDGE, the most prolific IO actor TAG tracks. DRAGONBRIDGE, also known as
“Spamouflage Dragon,” is a spammy influence network linked to China that has a presence
across multiple platforms.
Most DRAGONBRIDGE activity is low quality content without a political message, populated
across many channels and blogs. However, a small fraction of DRAGONBRIDGE accounts
also post about current events with messaging that pushes pro-China views.
DRAGONBRIDGE narratives in 2022 spanned a wide range of news topics — ranging from
China’s Covid-19 response to the war in Ukraine — and included a higher volume of content
critical of the US. The actor has primarily targeted Chinese speakers, but some narratives
were in English and other languages.
In 2022, Google disrupted over 50,000 instances of DRAGONBRIDGE activity across
YouTube, Blogger, and AdSense, reflecting our continued focus on this actor and success in
scaling our detection efforts across Google products. We have terminated over 100,000
DRAGONBRIDGE accounts in the IO network’s lifetime. Despite their scale and profuse
content production, DRAGONBRIDGE achieved practically no organic engagement from real
viewers — in 2022, the majority of DRAGONBRIDGE channels had 0 subscribers when
Google disrupted them, and over 80% of DRAGONBRIDGE videos had fewer than 100
views. Engagement for DRAGONBRIDGE’s blogs on Blogger was also low, with nearly 95%
receiving 10 or fewer views for blogs terminated in December.

While DRAGONBRIDGE has not attracted an organic audience, they are persistent and
adaptable. Since TAG started tracking the network in 2019, DRAGONBRIDGE has
consistently experimented with new tactics, new formats and higher quality content. As they
evolve over time, DRAGONBRIDGE’s coordinated inauthentic activity may eventually attract

1/12

the attention of real users. For this reason, TAG and Mandiant track DRAGONBRIDGE
closely and Google has taken an aggressive approach to identifying and removing their
content.

Content without an audience
In 2022, the overwhelming majority of DRAGONBRIDGE content Google disrupted never
reached a real audience. Among the 53,177 channels we disabled in 2022, 58% had zero
subscribers and 42% of their videos had zero views. 83% of those videos had fewer than
100 views.

In the rare cases where DRAGONBRIDGE content did receive engagement, it was almost
entirely inauthentic, coming from other DRAGONBRIDGE accounts and not from genuine
users. Comment activity was mostly from other DRAGONBRIDGE accounts.
Blogger engagement metrics also show almost no authentic audience for
DRAGONBRIDGE’s blogs. For blogs terminated in December, nearly 95% of
DRAGONBRIDGE blogs received 10 or fewer views, and over 96% received no comments.

Low quality and spammy
A feature of DRAGONBRIDGE – and likely a contributing reason they have not gained an
organic audience on YouTube and Blogger – is the low quality of their content, especially in
English. Most of their posts are spammy, nonsensical material without an overt political
message — often clips of animals, landscapes, food, sports and other content. Blurry
visuals, garbled audio, poor translations, malapropisms, and mispronunciations are also
common. The content is often hastily produced and error-prone — for example, neglecting to
remove Lorem Ipsum text from a video.

Pro-China narratives and increased criticism of the US
A small fraction of DRAGONBRIDGE channels and blogs post on current events, promoting
pro-China messages and criticizing the US. In 2022, DRAGONBRIDGE increased focus on
and sharpened their criticism of the US with posts mostly in Mandarin, in English and other
2/12

languages.

DRAGONBRIDGE’s pro-China content included narratives praising China’s pandemic
response, criticism of pro-democracy protests, and significantly in 2022, more strident
support for unification with Taiwan.
We saw an increase in DRAGONBRIDGE activity amidst heightened cross-strait
developments. Following the announcement of a possible visit to Taipei by then US House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi in late July, DRAGONBRIDGE shifted some of its focus towards
criticism of Speaker Pelosi, along with her family and finances. This was in line with usual
DRAGONBRIDGE patterns of attempting to discredit US political leadership.

5/12

However, during and after the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) military drills
straddling Taiwan in early August, DRAGONBRIDGE sharply escalated its rhetoric,
uploading militaristic videos of the PLA and political videos calling for Taiwanese President
Tsai Ing-Wen and her political allies to “surrender,” moving away from criticism of Speaker
Pelosi. DRAGONBRIDGE displayed unusually coherent behavior in using uniform hashtags
and titles across channels, while swiftly and repeatedly uploading topical, high-productionvalue content that was not interspersed with the usual misdirecting spam. The pace and
manner of this pivot highlighted DRAGONBRIDGE’s additional sensitivity to geopolitical
developments in China’s immediate neighborhood, and Taiwan in particular.

In 2022, DRAGONBRIDGE also posted narratives claiming the US was responsible for
stoking tensions abroad and meddling in the domestic affairs of other countries.
DRAGONBRIDGE’s US-focused narratives portrayed US society and democracy in a
negative light, cycling through political and social narratives that evolved with the headlines.
In 2022, Google removed DRAGONBRIDGE content on topics such as US Covid-19
response, racial inequality, political divisions, inflation, and other controversial topics.
In the leadup to the 2022 US midterm elections, Google terminated channels where
DRAGONBRIDGE attempted to spread narratives highlighting US political divisions, potential
for political violence, and threats to democracy. They presented election narratives as if they
were short news clips. One video, previously reported by Mandiant, attempted to cast voting
in the US as ineffective and a waste of time.

Bulk account infrastructure
To post their spam and IO content, DRAGONBRIDGE manages infrastructure consisting of
thousands of accounts at any given time. Google has terminated 100,960 accounts
associated with DRAGONBRIDGE over the network’s lifetime.
Rather than build their account infrastructure themselves, DRAGONBRIDGE obtains Google
Accounts from bulk account sellers who create and sell accounts for profit. We have seen
DRAGONBRIDGE reuse accounts that were previously used for financially motivated activity,

then went dormant before they resumed activity and posted DRAGONBRIDGE videos and
blogs. We believe accounts like this are changing hands from other bad actors to
DRAGONBRIDGE.

Evolving tactics and experimentation
DRAGONBRIDGE regularly experiments with new tactics, including producing a small
number of channels with high quality, bespoke content. These evolving tactics underscore
DRAGONBRIDGE’s willingness to experiment and their persistence. Tactics we saw
DRAGONBRIDGE test include:
High quality content with real human voice narration instead of a machine generated
voice
Talk show format with a real person on-camera discussing events in a “news like”
format
Animated political cartoons
IO content mixed in with high quality apolitical content, such as beauty advice and
cooking tips

Conclusion
Despite their failure to gain traction with an authentic audience, DRAGONBRIDGE generates
high volumes of content across multiple platforms, is persistent and continues to experiment
in their tactics and techniques. That is why we have scaled our efforts to disrupt
DRAGONBRIDGE coordinated inauthentic activity on our platforms. We encourage others in
the community to continue tracking this actor and shedding light on their operations and
would like to thank Mandiant and Graphika for their partnership in countering
DRAGONBRIDGE activity.
