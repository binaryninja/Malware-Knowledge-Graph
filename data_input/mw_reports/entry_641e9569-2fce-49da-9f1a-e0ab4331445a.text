While some ransomware groups operating as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) networks claim to steer clear of targeting specific sectors such
as hospitals or other critical industries to avoid causing harm to people, Hive’s attacks against healthcare providers in 2021 showed that
the operators behind it have no regard for such humanitarian considerations. A hospital in Missouri suffered a Hive ransomware attack three
weeks after the same group hit the integrated systems of a healthcare provider that affected three hospitals and many outpatient clinics in two
other US states. Hive ransomware has become one of the most active ransomware families since its discovery in June 2021. To defend
against this threat, it is therefore crucial for companies to be acquainted with the various mechanisms that the infamous ransomware gang
uses.

What do organizations need to know about Hive?

On August 15, 2021, Hive’s ransomware attacks against a non-profit integrated health system severely disrupted the clinical and financial
operations of three hospitals in Ohio and West Virginia. The attack resulted in emergency room diversions and cancelation of urgent surgical
cases and radiology examinations. The encryption of files forced the hospital staff to use paper charts. Aside from the three hospitals, the
affected non-profit also runs several outpatient service sites and clinics with a combined workforce of 3,000 employees.
Hive operators used double extortion techniques in this attack. Aside from the encryption of data, they also stole patient information that they
threatened to publish on HiveLeaks, their dedicated leak site. The gang shares the list of victims that have not paid the ransom on their Tor
site.
The incident prompted the FBI to issue an alert in late August that detailed Hive ransomware’s indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs). According to the alert, Hive operators use phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial
access to the system and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally once on the network.
The motivation of those in the cyber-underground to expand their foothold inevitably leads to the incursion of uncharted paths. In late October
2021, threat researchers discovered that Hive has new malware tools specifically developed to encrypt Linux and FreeBSD systems. The
report notes that Hive is among other ransomware operators that have set their sights on Linux servers. Other notorious ransomware groups
have also been known to create their own Linux encryptors.
As enterprises slowly migrate to virtual machines to achieve better device management and optimize the use of resources, targeting virtual
machines also makes good business sense for RaaS operators because it enables them to encrypt multiple servers simultaneously with just
one command. Researchers pointed out that Hive’s bespoke tool for Linux is not fully functional yet as it still cannot completely encrypt all files
when the malware was deployed in an explicit path. However, one can expect Hive to keep refining their Linux encryptors to diversify and
fortify its malware tool kit.

In January 2022, one of Europe’s largest car dealers suffered a Hive ransomware attack. The Swiss company’s name appeared as one of the
victims on HiveLeaks in February. Targeting high-value enterprises has become a trend for ransomware operators as can be gleaned from the
profile of the victim that reportedly generated US$3.29 billion in revenues for 2020.

Overview of Hive’s operations
Hive operations are more prolific than their leak site might suggest. HiveLeaks only publishes the list of victims that have not settled the
ransom, so it is tough to determine which — or how many — companies decided to pay the ransom. A report indicates that attack attempts by
Hive affiliates hit an average of three companies per day since the group was first discovered in June 2021. The report also mentioned that
security researchers who got access to information directly from the administrator panel of the Hive Tor site discovered that the number of
enterprises whose systems had been compromised have reached 355 from September to December 2021.
Intelligence gathered by the researchers further revealed that the founders of the group deliberately put systems in place to achieve as much
ease and transparency as possible particularly in the process of ransomware deployment and negotiations. Researchers also learned that the
generation of malware versions by affiliates can be done within 15 minutes, while negotiations are coursed through the Hive ransomware
administrators who relay the message to the victims in a chat window that the affiliates can see.
Researchers also shared that affiliates can see on the Hive administrator panel how much money was collected, the list of companies that
paid, and those whose information was leaked.
The group’s emphasis on operational efficiency and transparency is key to enticing new affiliates. It suggests that the group is aiming for
sustainability by creating an environment that is conducive to building a bigger and stronger affiliate base.
Of note is that some enterprises complained about the decryption tool that Hive operators provided after settling the ransom. Reports said it
lacked proper functionality and claimed that the Master Boot Records of their virtual machines were corrupted, rendering them incapable of
booting.

Top affected countries and industries
This section cites Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN) data on Hive’s attempts to compromise organizations. Our detections
show that Hive ransomware attack attempts against organizations were observed the most in South America, with Argentina receiving the

Targeted regions and sectors according to Hive’s leak site
An examination of the information that can be found on HiveLeaks reveals the number of successfully compromised companies that, as of this
writing, have declined to pay the ransom. In our monitoring of their leak site from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022, attacks were
highest in North America at 45.2% followed by Europe at 29% and Latin America at 12.9%.

Figure 4. Regional distribution of Hive victims according to the group’s leak site (December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)
Enterprises appear to be Hive’s preferred targets estimated at almost 40%. Their victims were from a wide range of sectors, with technology at
the top of the list having a victim count of 5. The healthcare and transportation sectors follow at 4 victims each. Other affected industries
include construction, media and entertainment, professional services, retail, materials, automotive, apparel and fashion.

only 6.5%.

Infection chain and techniques

Figure 6. Infection chain of Hive ransomware

Initial Access
Hive operators breach systems through phishing emails with malicious attachments. We also observed Microsoft Exchange as a possible
entry point for Hive ransomware based on our detection of the same post-exploitation scripts that can be found in the technique used to exploit
ProxyShell-related vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were identified as CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-34473 and CVE-2021-34523.

Execution
Hive operators attempt to run the persistence technique for a Cobalt Strike beacon that can be used as a C&C method to accomplish lateral
movement once they intrude into the system. Right after the attempt, Hive operators start to unload or uninstall antivirus (AV) products in the
system so they can proceed to the download and execution of hacking tools such as PCHunter, GMER, and TrojanSpy.DATASPY. They use
these tools to unload other AV products as a tactic to evade detection. We also observed the presence of WMI used to deploy uninstallation
scripts and ransomware across the networks for lateral movement.

Defense Evasion, Discovery, and Credential Access
We observed the presence of PCHunter and GMER as their tools to discover and terminate services or processes to disable AV software. We
also detected the use of TrojanSpy.DATASPY to gather information in the system such as machines in the network and the presence of
specific AV products. In another attack, the threat actors deployed KillAV to terminate several AV products, also to avoid detection.

Lateral Movement, Command-and-Control
The Hive gang uses RDP and WMI to move laterally in the compromised network and deliver the payload remotely. We also detected the use
of a BITSAdmin command for lateral movement. The threat actors also used PsExec to move laterally within the network.

Exfiltration
Our detections showed that the Hive operators use 7-Zip tool to archive stolen data for exfiltration. Moreover, the gang abuses anonymous filesharing services such as MEGASync, AnonFiles, SendSpace, and uFile to exfiltrate data.

Impact
The ransomware payload proceeds with the encryption routine upon execution. The ransomware generates a random key that is used to
encrypt based on RTLGenRandom API, which will be initially saved on the device’s memory. The key is then used in what appears to be a
custom implementation of the encryption process.
The key also encrypts through RSA via GoLang’s implementation of RSA encryption. It accomplishes the RSA encryption through a list of
public keys embedded in the binary. It is then saved as .key. on the encrypted drive.
The generated key will then be wiped from memory, leaving the encryption key as the only copy of the key for decryption.

Recommendations
Despite being relatively new, Hive ransomware has already made its mark as one of the most prolific and aggressive ransomware families
today. Our detections of their malicious activities show that their operations are robust, thus providing an incentive for new affiliates to join
them. Hive operators are also known to constantly refine and diversify their TTPs, so it is important for companies to stay vigilant and be wellinformed of potential threats. An organization stands a better chance of addressing ransomware threats if they implement strong defenses
early on.
To protect systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that allocate resources systematically for
establishing a strong defense strategy against ransomware.
Here are some best practices that organizations can consider:

Audit and inventory
Take an inventory of assets and data
Identify authorized and unauthorized devices and software
Audit event and incident logs

Configure and monitor

7/8

Manage hardware and software configurations
Grant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role
Monitor network ports, protocols, and services
Activate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers
Establish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications

Patch and update
Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
Perform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications
Update software and applications to their latest versions

Protect and recover
Implement data protection, backup, and recovery measures
Enable multifactor authentication (MFA)

Secure and defend
Employ sandbox analysis to block malicious emails
Deploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network
Detect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system
Use advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning

Train and test
Regularly train and assess employees on security skills.
Conduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.
