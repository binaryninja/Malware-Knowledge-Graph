Back to School: COBALT DICKENS Targets Universities

Despite indictments in March 2018, the Iranian threat group is likely responsible for a largescale campaign that targeted university credentials using the same spoofing tactics as
previous attacks. Friday, August 24, 2018 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
In August 2018, members of university communities worldwide may have been providing
access to more than just homework assignments.

Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers discovered a URL spoofing a login
page for a university. Further research into the IP address hosting the spoofed page revealed
a broader campaign to steal credentials. Sixteen domains contained over 300 spoofed
websites and login pages for 76 universities located in 14 countries, including Australia,
Canada, China, Israel, Japan, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United
States (see Figure 1).

After entering their credentials into the fake login page, victims were redirected to the
legitimate website where they were automatically logged into a valid session or were
prompted to enter their credentials again. Numerous spoofed domains referenced the
targeted universities' online library systems, indicating the threat actors' intent to gain access
to these resources.
CTU™ researchers were unable to confirm functionality of all identified spoofed pages
because some of the domains were not accessible at the time of analysis. Many of the
domains were registered between May and August 2018, with the most recent being
registered on August 19. Domain registrations indicate the infrastructure to support this
campaign was still being created when CTU researchers discovered the activity.
Most of the domains observed in this campaign resolved to the same IP address and DNS
name server. A domain registered in May 2018 also contained subdomains spoofing
university targets. These subdomains redirected visitors to spoofed login pages on other
attacker-controlled domains.

"The pain of parting is nothing to the joy of meeting again."
— Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens
The targeting of online academic resources is similar to previous cyber operations by
COBALT DICKENS, a threat group associated with the Iranian government. In those
operations, which also shared infrastructure with the August attacks, the threat group created
lookalike domains to phish targets and used credentials to steal intellectual property from
specific resources, including library systems. In March 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice
indicted the Mabna Institute and nine Iranian nationals in connection with COBALT DICKENS
activity occurring between 2013 and 2017. Many threat groups do not change their tactics
despite public disclosures, and CTU analysis suggests that COBALT DICKENS may be
responsible for the university targeting despite the indictments of some members.
Universities are attractive targets for threat actors interested in obtaining intellectual property.
In addition to being more difficult to secure than heavily regulated finance or healthcare
organizations, universities are known to develop cutting-edge research and can attract global
researchers and students. CTU researchers have contacted various global partners to
address this threat.
This widespread spoofing of login pages to steal credentials reinforces the need for
organizations to incorporate multifactor authentication using secure protocols and implement
complex password requirements on publicly accessible systems. CTU researchers
recommend that clients implement training programs to educate users about security threats,
including guidance for recognizing and reporting suspicious emails.
CTU researchers have identified indicators for this threat (see Table 1). Note that IP
addresses can be reallocated. The domains and IP address may contain malicious content,
