Malicious Word File Targeting Corporate Users Being
Distributed

March 30, 2022

The ASEC analysis team discovered a Word file that seems to target corporate users. The
file contains an image that prompts users to enable macros like other malicious files. To trick
users into thinking that this is an innocuous file, it shows information related to improving
Google account security when the macro is run. Ultimately, it downloads additional malware
files and leaks user information.
When the file is run, it shows a warning image that mentions ‘file created in public institution
form HWP’ in Korean, prompting users to run the VBA macro existing within the file. It also
has memos on the right side to make it look as if the file is created by Microsoft. The author
on the document properties is displayed as Microsoft as well.

When users press the Enable Content button, the information about improving the Google
account security is displayed as shown below.

To make it difficult to check the macro code included in the document, VBA Project has a
password set for the document.

Figure 4. VBA Project set with a password
The confirmed macro code is automatically run through the AutoOpen function and performs
malicious activities through the RunFE() function.

Sub AutoOpen()
Call CTD
Dim rfRes As Long
rfRes = RunFE()
If rfRes = 1 Then
Call HideInlineShapes
Call ShowShapes
Call CommnetDelete
End If
'
Call ShowInlineShapes
'
Call HideShapes
End Sub

The RunFE() function has the download URL encoded with Base64 and certain Hex values.

Figure 5. Part of macro code
The macro code has two download URLs. This is likely done to download the malware that
fits the user’s PC environment. The decoding result of the encoded URL is as follows:
x86 environment –
hxxp://4w9H8PS9.naveicoipc[.]tech/ACMS/7qsRn3sZ/7qsRn3sZ32.acm
x64 environment –
hxxp://4w9H8PS9.naveicoipc[.]tech/ACMS/7qsRn3sZ/7qsRn3sZ64.acm
When the connection fails, a message box telling user to open the document after
connecting to the Internet appears.

If the code can access the download URL, the encoded PE data existing in the address is
downloaded. The downloaded PE data is run after it is decoded and injected into the Word
process.
Inside the injected code is a code that checks if AhnLab products’ process exists within the
current processes.

Figure 7. Code for checking AhnLab products’ processes
If there is a process named v3l4sp.exe (V3Lite), the code will not perform additional
malicious behaviors and terminate itself. As such, the code does not perform additional
malicious behavior for individual users using V3Lite. The case is different for company users,
however.
It drops IntelRST.exe to the %ProgramData%\Intel folder after checking the process and
uses the following registry to make IntelRST.exe run continuously.

6/9

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\IntelCUI
Data: “C:\ProgramData\Intel\IntelRST.exe”
It also runs IntelRST.exe with the privilege escalated via UAC Bypass using winver.exe and
ComputerDefaults.exe. IntelRST.exe is registered as an exclusion for Windows Defender
through the following command.
cmd.exe /c powershell -Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath
“C:\ProgramData\Intel\IntelRST.exe”
The figure below shows the process tree that is run.

The code then sends the user PC information to hxxp://naveicoipc[.]tech/post.php and
attempts to access hxxp://naveicoipc[.]tech/7qsRn3sZ/7qsRn3sZ_[user
name]_/fecommand.acm. Since the URL cannot be accessed, the team could not find out
what the code does after.
The team also found another word file (file name: Case Mediation
Statement_BA6Q318N.doc) but could not check its content as it was protected with a
password. The download URLs checked from the VBA macro included in the document are
as follows:
x86 – hxxp://MOmls4ii.naveicoipa[.]tech/ACMS/BA6Q318N/BA6Q318N32.acm
x64 – hxxp://MOmls4ii.naveicoipa[.]tech/ACMS/BA6Q318N/BA6Q318N64.acm

Figure 9. Additionally found malicious Word file 1
As seen from the figure, among the documents distributed with the malicious macro of this
type, there are files protected with passwords. The figure below shows another Word file (file
name: Binance_Guide (1).doc) that the team found.
x86 environment –
hxxp://uzzmuqwv.naveicoipc[.]tech/ACMS/1uFnvppj/1uFnvppj32.acm
x64 environment –
hxxp://uzzmuqwv.naveicoipc[.]tech/ACMS/1uFnvppj/1uFnvppj64.acm

As malicious Word files targeting Korean users have been continually discovered, users
should take extreme caution. They must configure appropriate security settings to prevent
malicious macros from being automatically enabled and refrain from running files with
unknown sources.
