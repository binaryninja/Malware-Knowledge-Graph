Cybercriminals cash in on black market vaccine schemes

If you look back through all of the research Intel 471 has released on cybercriminals making
money on stolen digital assets, a major takeaway is that the cyber underground will adopt
any scheme, as long as it results in money being made. With the world trying to move past
the global COVID-19 pandemic, another opportunity for illegal gains has struck.
Intel 471 has observed numerous actors on various underground forums selling fake COVID
vaccine certifications, as well as several forums hosting advertisements for COVID-19
vaccines. While these advertisements have proliferated for months, we have observed these
schemes growing on underground forums that are rooted in the cybercrime ecosystem.
Of those fake vaccine passes being advertised, we have seen the concentration placed on the
United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccination card, which is a
paper form, and the European Union’s vaccine passport, which is issued in both digital and
paper forms. On one particular cybercrime forum, an actor has listed several advertisements
for fake vaccination cards that parrots a lot of the misinformation that surround the various
COVID-19 vaccines.
“We do this to help people who are in critical situations and want to travel urgently,” the
advertisement reads. “Watch out and stay away from the vaccine; it’s poisonous. Kindly pass
out the message to those who are still blind out there, so many secrets are hidden from us.
The minority ruling are trying to destroy mankind.”
The actor has set up several communication channels for anyone interested: potential
customers can reach out via encrypted messaging services Telegram, WhatsApp, and Wickr,
or encrypted email service ProtonMail.
Another advertisement on the same forum offers fake CDC cards. These falsified documents
are focused on the European and French documents and associated false QR codes. The
website, accessible via the TOR browser, shows what the final QR code product will look like:

With regards to the actual vaccine, an actor’s advertisement that Intel 471 observed claimed
to be able to send potential buyers numerous different vaccines currently on the market:
AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, and Sputnik V. Buyers were then
directed to visit a particular website set up for sales. However, that e-commerce website was
not working at the time this blog post was published.
There have been numerous reports that this falsified document practice has been going on
for months. However, we have seen the market change as the virus causes different issues in
various parts of the world. Actors will:
Read open-source news to determine which countries are not getting enough, or any,
deliveries of the vaccine.
Market the illegal vaccine to these developing countries since these nations have no
private way of obtaining vaccines and must instead rely on COVAX distribution.
Undermine the pharmaceutical companies’ efforts to distribute the vaccine, putting
people in danger since they have very little recourse to determine if the vaccines are
legitimate.

Be it underground vaccine sales or counterfeit vaccine passes, actors are monetizing the fear
and misinformation around COVID-19, creating a new market that has been constructed
partly by pushing people who have never purchased anything illicit to buy things off of the
underground. While the schemes carried out in this blog do not directly impact an
organization’s cybersecurity defenses, it can hurt pharmaceutical companies by robbing them
of consumers and damaging their brand reputations. In addition, fake vaccine passports
harm healthcare, erodes government trust with false information, and can disrupt local and
national economies.
No matter the damage wrought, it shows that cybercriminals and the forums where they
gather online will take on any scheme, no matter how technical, in order to make money.
