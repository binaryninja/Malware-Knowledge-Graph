tl;dr
NCC Group’s Incident Response team observed a new variant of the FiveHands
ransomware, deployed by an affiliate leveraging publicly available tools to progress their
attack. This blog post aims to describe the developments in the ransomware variant and the
techniques used by the affiliate.
The affiliate appears to have been active for a long period of time. Open-source intelligence
suggests a link to UNC2447, matching several characteristics shown through the campaign.
Including aggressive tactics when urging the victim to pay the ransom. In this instance,

attempts were made to directly call individuals within the organisation using spoofed caller
IDs.

Initial Access
An externally facing SonicWall VPN appliance was the initial access vector exploited by the
actor, allowing them to generate a VPN profile and join the target network using the
hostname “Commando”, which matches the default hostname of the complete Mandiant
offensive VM. In addition, the source port of 4444 was used which is the default listener port
for Metasploit.

Attackers Toolbox
Several publicly available tools were leveraged by the attacker, a brief description has been
provided below detailing their functionality.

Netscan.exe
The SoftPerfect website states that the “SoftPerfect Network Scanner can ping computers,
scan ports, discover shared folders, and retrieve practically any information about network
devices, via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Secure Shell (SSH), and PowerShell.
It also scans for remote services, registry, files and performance counters; offers flexible
filtering and display options and exports NetScan results to a variety of formats from XML to
JSON.”

Advanced_port_Scanner.exe
The advanced port scanner website states that the “Advanced Port Scanner is a free
network scanner allowing you to quickly find open ports on network computers and retrieve
versions of programs running on the detected ports.”

Hostclean.exe
Preferring a GUI environment, the remote desktop software “Remote Utilities” was used to
enact some level of persistent C2 with hosts connecting back to the master console which
was an IP address based in Russia.
Reviewing the log files revealed the user account used to register the product:
pau7887pau@yandex[.]ru. Open source research provides a link to Hybrid Analysis pointing
towards a sample that was uploaded in July 2020, which turns out to be the remote desktop
tool by Remote Utilities.

pCloud.exe
The pCloud website states that “pCloud is Europe’s most secure encrypted cloud storage,
where you can store your personal files or backup your PC or share your business
documents with your team”
pCloud was leveraged as the main data exfiltration method.

AllInOnePasswordRecoveryPro.exe
AllInOnePasswordRecoveryPro website states that “All-In-One Password Recovery Pro is
the enterprise software to instantly recover ALL your lost or forgotten passwords from 100+
popular Windows Apps with a click of button. Long & short, it is the One software to recover
your all type of passwords including website login, e-mail, messenger, FTP, download
manager, remote desktop, database, router, credential manager, Wi-Fi passwords.”

PsExec.exe
PsExec.exe is the legitimate remote administration program by Sysinternals. This utility was
used to remotely execute the encryptor.exe payload and create accounts.

Encryptor.exe
Encryptor.exe was the loader for the FiveHands ransomware. The loader was written in Go
and took a 16-byte key over the command line using the “-key” switch to decrypt the payload,
before loading the ransomware directly into memory. It is believed that the key is derived
during the build process to generate a unique binary as part of RaaS.
As in most cases, where command line logging is not enabled, it was fortunate the actor
used RDP extensively as the -key parameters were obtained through the bitmap cache. In
short, the bitmap cache is a collection of small bitmap files that make up snippets of an RDP
session. A large proportion of the key could be seen in the bitmap images available, the
remaining characters obtained through brute forcing the key. The key is 16 characters long
and is made up of upper- and lower-case characters with numbers. No symbols were
present.

Passwords
A unique attribute of the affiliate was the use of the password “Remark123!”. Open source
research throws up a link to the online sandbox “AnyRun” containing the following command
executed “net localgroup Administrators gook /add” as part of “Update.exe”. Followed by
adding the user to the Remote Desktop Users group, the favoured lateral movement
technique for the actor.
The upload timestamp of 12/08/2020 paired with prior information suggests the actor has
been active for quite some time, predating FiveHands involvement.

pCloud Data Exfiltration
Yet another internet cloud storage provider being used maliciously for data exfiltration,
pCloud joins the list. Although a paid product, a free account will allow users to store up to
10GB of files. The operation of pCloud is similar to that of other cloud storage products such
as Google Drive, managed both through an installed application or a web browser. The
installed version provides a virtual disk which is used to sync files with the cloud.
Whilst pCloud syncs/uploads files from the host, the contents are cached locally on disk in
the following location:
C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\local\pCloud\Cache\Cached

Using your favourite file carving tool, it is possible to recover the contents of files synced with
the cloud. In turn revealing data exfil! A valuable outcome for most forensic investigators.

FiveHands Ransomware
The sample analysed has many similarities with what is already in the public domain
however, the developers have added and changed parts of the code. For example, the
target’s ID for the TOR ransomware page is not generated at runtime but it is hardcoded. We
assess that this ransomware family operates under a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)
model.

Technical Analysis
The loader observed was written in Go, with the ransomware written in C++.
The entry point and the core functionality of the ransomware is stored in the export function
‘Run’. Despite the loader not passing any command line parameters, the ransomware
supports the following:
Parameter

Description
4/8

-limit

Specify the maximum size of a file to encrypt

-skip

Specify the minimum size of files to encrypt

-blocks

Encrypt only the first block (163840 bytes at most) of a file

-full

Encrypt the entire file

-path

Encrypt only a specified path

The ransomware can encrypt the following resources:
Network Shares
Mounted Drives
Specified File Paths (-path parameter)

Encryption Process
The ransomware sample uses a combination of RSA and AES algorithms in order to encrypt
a file on the system. The implementations of the encryption algorithms are taken directly
from the open-source library ‘Mbed TLS’.
Generally, the following steps are taken:
1. Generate a new AES-128 key (CBC mode) and encrypt a block (163840 bytes at most) of
the target file
2. Store the AES key/IV and other metadata of the target file in a memory block and encrypt
it using an embedded public RSA key (See Appendix section for a detailed description of the
memory block)
3. If there is more data to encrypt in the target file then keep encrypting each block but with a
new AES IV each time
4. Add the extension ‘.crypt’ to the encrypted file. The developers have also included the
extension ‘).crypt’. This extension is only used if the use of ‘.crypt’ fails.
The above process is repeated for each target file. In case of a locked file, the ransomware
attempts to unlock it via the ‘Windows Restart Manager’.
The ransomware excludes the following folders and extensions from the encryption process:

$recycle.bin
