Summary
PlugX is a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware family that is around since 2008 and is
used as a backdoor to fully control the victim's machine. Once the machine is infected, a
cybercriminal can remotely execute several kinds of commands on the affected system.
Notable features of this malware family is the ability to execute commands on the affected
machine in order to retrieve machine information, capture the screen, send keyboard and
mouse events, key logger, reboot the system, manage processes (create, kill and
enumerate), manage services (create, start, stop, etc.), manage Windows registry entries,
open a shell, etc.
The malware also logs its own events in a text log file, probably in an attempt to enhance
itself.
Malware Installation
This sample is a Windows Self-Extracting Archive that contains a legitimate PDF document
file along with the malware dropper (a regular PE32 executable file for MS Windows).
Once executed, the sample extracts the PDF document and the dropper file to the temp
folder:
%Temp%\1.pdf
%Temp%\1.exe

1/11

The malware then opens and displays the legitimate PDF document, making the victim
believe that this is the only content and purpose of the self-extracting file:

Right after that, the dropper file is executed. It drops the following files on the affected
system:
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\SxSi\rc.exe
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\SxSi\rcdll.dll
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\SxSi\rc.hlp
And creates a new instance of %WINDIR%\system32\svchost.exe (Windows generic host
process for services that run from dynamic-link libraries), which creates an instance of
%WINDIR%\system32\msiexec.exe (Windows installer component).
The dropper then executes %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\SxSi\rc.exe, a clean and legitimate
signed executable file - which loads %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\SxSi\rcdll.dll, a malicious
dynamic-link library used as a loader. The loader decrypts the encrypted payload in the
malicious binary file %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\SxSi\rc.hlp and injects it in both newly created
%WINDIR%\system32\svchost.exe and %\system32\msiexec.exe processes.
As result, malicious code is injected and running in system processes:

Once running, the malware creates a hidden log file to trace information and errors during its
execution, probably in an attempt by the authors to enhance it:
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\SxSi\bug.log

It is worth to mention that malware installation procedures, filenames, locations and other
details may vary depending on the analyzed sample.

Malware Persistency Techniques
The malware installs itself as a Windows service and is configured to automatically start
during Windows startup (start type equals to “2”) to make itself persistent:
HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\SxSi\Start: 0x00000002
HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\SxSi\ImagePath: ""C:\Documents and Settings\All
Users\SxSi\rc.exe" 200 0"
HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\SxSi\DisplayName: "SxSi"
HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\SxSi\ObjectName: "LocalSystem"
HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\SxSi\Description: "SxSi"
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SxSi\Start: 0x00000002
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SxSi\ImagePath: ""C:\Documents and
Settings\All Users\SxSi\rc.exe" 200 0"
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SxSi\DisplayName: "SxSi"
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SxSi\ObjectName: "LocalSystem"

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SxSi\Description: "SxSi"

Malware Protective Mechanisms
To protect the dropped files, the malware installs itself as a hidden Windows service/driver:

6/11

As result, the malware will run as a service and automatically start during Windows startup,
however the victim will not be able to see it in the list of running services.
The malware also drops three files, including a legitimate signed executable files that loads
the encrypted malicious code, thus making it difficult to be detected by AV.
Finally, the malware keeps all its related files encrypted while in the disk, only being
unencrypted in the memory when injected in system processes, making it difficult to be
detected by static analysis tools.
Method of Infection
The malware spreads through phishing attacks by email containing malicious attachments.

Network Behavior
The malware can communicate to the server using TCP, UDP and HTTP protocols. Data
sent to the server is encrypted.
The malware also uses GET and POST requests as following:
