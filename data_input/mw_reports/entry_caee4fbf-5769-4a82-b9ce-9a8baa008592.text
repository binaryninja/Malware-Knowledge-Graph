Table of Contents
Toward the latter half of Q4 2022, ReliaQuest discovered a security incident unfolding in a
customer’s environment. A threat actor gained initial network access, rapidly escalated their
privileges, and moved laterally, quickly establishing a foothold in 77 minutes.
We severed the foothold the adversary established and worked alongside the impacted
customer to remediate the implications of the intrusion, but some valuable lessons should be
taken away: many of the attackers’ actions were assisted by an accepted risk that, if
avoided, could have prevented—or at least slowed—their advances.
The threat actors’ techniques—notably the use of “QBot” for initial access—suggested they
are an affiliate of the “Black Basta” ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program. Ransomware
remains, arguably, the most pernicious threat that businesses face in 2023. Let’s go over
some simple changes that can often mean the difference between remediation and
catastrophe.

What Is QBot?
Also known as Qakbot, QuackBot, and Pinkslipbot, QBot is a banking trojan that was first
observed in 2007. As observed with other prominent banking trojans, like “Emotet,” QBot
has come to acquire many new functions and is consistently being developed to incorporate
new techniques and capabilities. In addition to stealing financial details and personally
identifiable information (PII), QBot can be used for lateral movement, detection evasion and
debugging, and installing additional malware on compromised machines.

Attack Overview: Stealth and Swiftness
On September 29, 2022, we detected malicious activity after the deployment of Cobalt Strike
Beacon and remote management software in a customer’s environment. The attacker
achieved initial access via a phishing email delivered to end-user inboxes—having slipped
past an overly permissive security solution.
This phishing email led to the deployment of the QBot malware and gave the attacker an
initial foothold in the environment. They obtained valid service account credentials that were
part of a domain administrator group, smoothing the path to move laterally and deploy other
Cobalt Strike beacons.
The timeline of initial QBot execution to lateral movement, commonly known as the breakout
time, was 77 minutes. (See Figure 1 for a timeline.) This is ​far quicker than most cases of
this kind, which usually have a breakout time of around 2 hours.
The attacker’s actions had the whiff of a Black Basta affiliate, with Qbot activity widely
reported as being a cornerstone of Black Basta intrusions. Black Basta is a splinter group
that emerged after the “Conti” ransomware syndicate was quelled; its members moved on to
alternative ransomware programs. The Black Basta group operates a ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS) program.

Kill Chain Details: Where Did It All Go Wrong?
3/19

Initial Access
The phishing email that granted initial access was delivered on 26 Sep 2022. The
attachment to the message was named REF#6547_SEP_28.HTML, which was rightly
detected by Office 365 management as malicious: It was smuggling a ZIP file onto the
targeted network, to deliver a QBot implant. The email’s content prompted the recipient to
look at the attached file and approve its content.

Execution
Execution was achieved by HTML smuggling. Upon opening the HTML file in an email client,
the screen pictured in Figure 2 was shown and the user was asked to download it locally.
After they did so and opened the HTML file in a browser, an encoded JavaScript binary large
object (BLOB) surfaced. The BLOB then constructed and automatically downloaded a ZIP
file to the user’s disk.

The ZIP file was protected by the password that then appeared on the screen: abc333. Once
opened, an ISO image was found within the zipped archive; if double-clicked, the ISO was
mounted to disk. Within the new drive—which is created when the ISO is mounted—was a
LNK file, which pointed at a JS file which in turn invokes script STICKLERBLOWN.CMD. Of
course, this all starts with the user clicking on that LNK file.
This concluded the current QBot delivery chain, with QBot acting as both trojan and malware
dropper to enable an initial foothold onto a target’s environment. Fake Adobe Acrobat
updates have long been synonymous with the spread of malware, so nothing new here, but
it continues to be effective as the software is free and widely used.
In this case, the attacker used the initial QBot foothold to deliver a Cobalt Strike beacon to
the beachhead. Cobalt Strike and post-exploitation tools are typical follow-on payloads
resulting from these infections. Often, commodity malware is used before moving on to a
command-and-control (C2) implant of the attacker’s choosing to solidify their foothold on the
network.

Command-and-Control
At this point, the threat actor pivoted from the QBot C2 channel to their newly established C2
channel provided by the Cobalt Strike beacon. It was an HTTPS beacon that communicated
with its team server located at 194.165.16[.]95, similar to in other QBot campaigns of RaaS
affiliates and initial access brokers (IABs). (We’ve written before about the increasing role of
IABs in facilitating cybercrime.)

6/19

The attacker also used alternative HTTPs channels to communicate and maintain their
foothold. They deployed and configured remote-access software AnyDesk, Atera, and
Splashtop, which use the HTTPS protocol.
The use of commercial remote access software is common. Threat actors associated with
Conti ransomware’s affiliate program often use Atera and AnyDesk. In this case, AnyDesk
was installed following the identification and containment of Atera agents, which had been
deployed to multiple compromised hosts. These agents were linked to email address
UQUISKISESHLM[at]GMAIL[.]COM, which appears to be a random mix of letters; this was
most likely conducted for OPSEC purposes.

Credential Access
Credential access was achieved after the threat actor used the Data Protection Application
Programming Interface (DPAPI) to interact with a credential key for an account; DPAPI is
used to protect personal data on the local system, including user credentials. This is a
common target for credential harvesting, and in this case, it resulted in the account being
compromised. Some of the most common tools—including Mimikatz which was also used
during the incident—provide ways to interact with DPAPI to access credentials; Mimikatz is
an open-source malware program used by hackers and penetration testers to gather
credentials on Windows computers

Privilege Escalation and Persistence
7/19

During the intrusion, the attacker primarily made use of a service account with domain
administrator privileges. It freed them to carry out objectives until the account was disabled,
at which point the attacker pivoted to another valid account that was also a member of the
domain administrators’ group. This quick pivot upon disabling their primary account was
notable.
We were also able to identify another operation which highlights on the theme that the
attacker liked to have several available options. We identified that the threat actor attempted
to add an account named OLDADMINISTRATOR to the Local Administrators group, on
hosts where a local account named ADMINN had been previously created. We never
identified a further account creation for the account OLDADMINISTRATOR, which appeared
odd. In the Conti affiliate manual, the affiliate is told to create the account
OLDADMINISTRATOR with the password qc69t4B#Z0kE3 and then add that account to
the Local Administrators group. What the actor did in this case is mistakenly attempted to
add the account they were supposed to add to the Local Administrators group. Since the
OLDADMINISTRATOR had not been created, this was ultimately unsuccessful.
Of all the details we uncovered, this was perhaps the most comical. Even with a playbook,
human error is still inevitable. It was also somewhat surprising that Conti’s affiliates clearly
follow the step-by-step rulebook to a T, even using predesignated passwords.

8/19

Discovery

9/19

Windows binaries were used for network discovery including NET, ARP, ROUTE, NETSTAT,
IPCONFIG, and WHOAMI; these were also seen as children processes of WERMGR.EXE.
In this case, the Qbot infection was responsible for these discovery operations as the Qbot
payload was being run in a memory space of the wermgr.exe process.
We also identified the attacker making use of a networking scanning tool later during this
intrusion. The attacker was seen using the tool NETSCAN.EXE, which can scan hosts within
the network for accessible network shares—another tool known to be used by Conti
affiliates.

10/19

Lateral Movement

11/19

To move laterally, the attacker established remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections,
including hijacking active RDP sessions on targeted hosts. They did this by using
QUSER.EXE: a binary that can enumerate active RDP sessions on devices and identify new
users in an environment. Some hijacking attempts failed, and some were successful.

12/19

By investigating events surrounding the failed RDP connections, we saw that the threat actor
was accessing administrative shares; admin shares give system administrators remote
access to every disk volume on a network-connected system. These shares included the
IPC$ network share, which was likely used to establish a remote procedure call (RPC) or
server message block (SMB) session. Again, this move was probably made to enable lateral
movement.

Collection and Exfiltration
For collection, the threat actor used QBot to start the process ESENTUTL.EXE, which is a
Living off the Land binary (LOLBin) that provides copy functionality. QBot is known to
harvest email data, but whether it did in this case isn’t known: A lack of command-line
arguments in the host’s Windows event logs meant verification wasn’t possible.

13/19

Although ransomware operators are known to prioritize data exfiltration during intrusions, we
didn’t find any evidence that this attacker stole data. We did find outbound connections to
Cobalt Strike infrastructure (IP address 194.165.16[.]95), but they were likely for typical C2
traffic, rather than being conduits for exfiltrating data. No other tools commonly used for data
exfiltration turned up during our investigation.

Defense Evasion
Throughout the event, this attacker used several defense evasion techniques including
compressing an email payload, overpass the hash, and process injection. The threat actor
archived the QBot payload into a disk image (ISO) file, and then compressed the disk image

14/19

into a password-encrypted ZIP file to evade email security and Mark of the Web (MotW)
controls implemented by Microsoft. They managed this by compressing the payload into a
ZIP file-ISO image combination.
This threat actor also performed a sub-technique of pass the hash, known as overpass the
hash: passing a targeted account’s New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) hash to the
Kerberos authentication provider, resulting in a successful Kerberos authentication.
Process injection was used by both the initial QBot payload (into WERMGR.EXE) and the
subsequent deployment of Cobalt Strike (into WERFAULT.EXE).
Process Injection inserts arbitrary code into the address space of another process, giving the
appearance that the injected (malicious) code was performed by a normal system process.
This evades static detection and application control solutions.

Black Basta’s Conti-Linked Heritage
After emerging in 2019, the Conti ransomware group became a top-tier ransomware group
before collapsing in May 2022. The demise likely stemmed from a series of operational
errors that led to a compromise of Conti’s infrastructure.
Chat logs taken from Conti were a treasure trove of intelligence for law enforcers and
security researchers alike. (You might remember our previous blog exploring five lessons
from the Conti breach.) The release of the chat logs also coincided with several other highprofile faux-pas by the group. These included supporting the Russian state during the onset
of the war with Ukraine, and also revealed major attacks against the Costa Rican
government.

Conti Splinters, Members Move On
As part of Conti’s splintering, many members unsurprisingly sought new employment in
other ransomware groups. LockBit—which now accounts, overwhelmingly, for the largest
market share of ransomware activity—was among the groups that probably welcomed a new
intake of members from Conti. Several other groups have also reportedly splintered from
Conti , notably the “Karakurt Hacking Team,” the “Royal” ransomware group, and Black
Basta—those infamous actors attributed to this security incident.
Black Basta first emerged in April 2022, a month before Conti folded. As most major
ransomware groups do, Black Basta uses double-extortion to solicit ransom payments,
posting stolen data to its Basta News data-leak site if payment is not received within seven
days. Black Basta is known to target a wide variety regions and sectors, but mainly
construction and industrial goods and services in the US and Germany.

15/19

Black Basta Forecast: Stormy Weather
What’s the future for Black Basta and similar splinter groups? Well it’s likely that they’ll
encounter increasing scrutiny from governments and law enforcement agencies. On 02 Feb
2023, the UK National Crime Agency and the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control sanctioned seven individuals allegedly involved with Conti and
“TrickBot” malware activity. Their real names, birthdates, email addresses, and photos were
made public and their lives restricted. This is the first time the UK has sanctioned individuals
involved with ransomware, and it’s not likely to be the last.

16/19

Those sanctions are part of a wider campaign, portending more arrests, disruptions, and
infrastructure take-downs by international law enforcement in the next one to three months.
It’s unlikely to have any direct impact on ransomware operations, but it’s the kind of scrutiny
that often leads to the closure of threat groups—and the ever-predictable “whack-a-mole”
effort to tackle ransomware. (Once a group goes down, you just know they’ll return in some
fashion.) If Black Basta members are named and shamed in future sanctions or arrests, we
might see another round of ransomware rebranding.

Retaining Ransomware Resilience
Visibility is one of the key ways organizations can minimize the risks posed by the abundant
active cyber threats in 2023. You can’t secure what’s invisible to your incident responders,
so ensuring effective logging coverings your assets is essential to detecting and responding
to threats. The lack of logs forwarded to the SIEM meant ReliaQuest needed forensics
images and event log exports to fill in most of the events in this incident. We’ve written
before about the importance of maximizing business insights by improving logging activities.
Other steps you can take to avoid being impacted by QBot or ransomware activity are as
follows.
Harden perimeter security to restrict company assets from making arbitrary
connections to the internet. This may be accomplished through firewall or proxy
configurations. This will minimize malware and command-and-control (C2) activity.
Limit use of remote-access software. This software is one of the most common
methods for cybercriminals—notably initial access brokers (IABs) and ransomware
operators—to gain access to targeted networks. Consider minimizing the use of such
software unless absolutely required for an individual for their jobs. The use of such
technology should also be placed under enhanced monitoring to detect any misuse.
Disable ISO mounting. ISO Mounting is increasingly being used as a method of
bypassing anti-virus and endpoint detection tools. Consider disabling ISO mounting by
adding the registry key referenced below, which removes the context menu for users
when right clicking. This can also be added to your Group Policy to provide protection
to all users, while still allowing administrators to mount drives with PowerShell and the
Mount-DiskImage command. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Windows.IsoFile\shell\mount
called ProgrammaticAccessOnly

Ensure the security of backups and regularly test them for reliability. The “3-2-1” rule is
one of the most tried and tested rules for backups, this guideline states that
organizations should keep three backup copies, across two different mediums, with
one stored off-site. Many businesses may use a combination of the cloud and physical
storage to facilitate this requirement. This is also arguably the most secure way to back
up data and avoids the risk of backups that are stored on NAS or other networkstorage devices being corrupted during a ransomware attack.

ReliaQuest provides a “detection-in-depth” approach to attack coverage, which relies on
proper logging being in place. This can be achieved by engaging with our GreyMatter
platform, which provides a unified detection-investigation-response process, greatly
increasing visibility of the various threats across your attack surface. Having better visibility
into threats reduces complexity and helps efficiently manage risk for your business.
