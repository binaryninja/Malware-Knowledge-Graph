compromise (IoCs) list.
We investigated a number of websites with cracks and pirated software that start an
infection chain to multiple pieces of malware and adware, including CopperStealer and
LNKR adware. The malicious samples are usually distributed via pay-per-install (PPI)
networks. Our analysis showed that the samples of CopperStealer that we found are
capable of scanning infected systems for specific browser credentials and cookies. They
also terminate the entire routine if the systems’ settings are in Chinese, run in the
sandbox, or are analyzed in a debugger. In addition, they are also capable of installing
malicious browser extensions and stealing stored Facebook and Google credentials for
malicious advertising.

Figure 1. Infection vector

These infections — the use of which is a common technique among cybercriminals —
were unknowingly initiated by the victims when they visited warez (also known as
crackz, toolz, appz, and gamez) websites, which often redirect users to another site with
malware distribution. Some of these websites contain links to the requested files, but
usually they use a very small font. As a result, these are often overlooked by website
visitors. Additionally, there are misleading “Download” buttons or other similar prompts
for action. Upon selecting any of these buttons, a user unknowingly starts a redirection
chain that leads to the download of malware.

Figure 2. A warez website with a misleading layout

For each tool, a visitor will see the description, screenshots, and buttons in red and blue,
including a link in green. This link opens another page with more misleading buttons
that initiate the malicious redirection chain. If a user wants to download the application,
tool, or crack, they have to choose one of the “Server” links in the middle of the webpage.
Not all of the sites that we examined contained useful content at the time of writing.
However, we did note the ironic mention of cybersecurity vendors as a ploy to add
credibility to the app.

Figure 5. Redirecting users to malicious pages

Redirections and PPI schemes
After a user selects the “Download” button, one of several possible redirection chains
starts. The redirection chain that begins after a user selects “Download” then leads to the
archive download. Most of the redirection chain top-level domains (TLDs) use .xyz. The
redirection scripts are usually implemented in PHP and have several parameters like
user identification (id) or webpage title (q). This redirection chain seems to belong to
one of two PPI networks, boostads and installusd.

sections, we discuss our findings on CopperStealer, its modules and the browser plug-ins
that it installs. It is important to note that one of the installed browser plug-ins is called
LNKR, which is an adware injection platform.
CopperStealer and LNKR
CopperStealer was seen at large stealing browser cookies and credentials from victims at
the end of 2019. We found that CopperStealer had many similarities with a spyware
campaign in April 2019, while a recent report attributes this malware to another
campaign targeting social media platforms. However, we believe that these are different
campaigns that use similar tools to steal victims’ credentials.
After dissecting the samples of CopperStealer that we found, our analysis showed that
infected systems had malicious browser extensions (we identify these in their respective
sections and quick descriptions). One of the malicious extensions is LNKR
(CRX/book_helper), which has been identified in connection with a phishing kit. This is
the first time that we have seen both malware distributed at large. In this section, we
share the analysis of CopperStealer and LNKR. Notably, both of them have sophisticated
infection approaches and tactics that they use to profit from their victims. We also show
how these malware have been distributed with the PPI networks.
First Stage
The .exe file that was unpacked from the compressed file appears to be a partially
overwritten legitimate executable. The entry point is overwritten by a custom shellcode
and an encrypted payload (second stage) is appended to the overlay at the end of the file.
In the following case, it is a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installer, though
any other regular executable could be partially overwritten in a similar way. In the case
of opening the overwritten NSIS file (for example in 7-Zip), the executable shows the
content of the installer. This happens because the “NullsoftInst” keyword and the
original installation files are still intact.
However, instead of the original
NSIS installer stub, the custom
shellcode is executed. It then
decrypts and executes the
embedded payload. The shellcode

address 0x04 (0x44 from the
beginning of EXE file) and uses this value (0x160FF3) as an offset of the encrypted
payload within the EXE file. The decimal value of the offset “0x160FF3 = 1445875” will
be used as an XOR key for decrypting the second stage.

Second stage
The second stage begins with the drop of the clean installer gdiview.msi
(DBD9F2128F0B92B21EF99A1D7A0F93F14EBE475DBA436D8B1562677821B918A1),
which is a decoy installer. The decoy starts its installation process to cover for the
malware’s installation. It uses a domain generation algorithm to generate the commandand-control (C&C) server name. The algorithm uses “changenewsys” string followed by
the current date, then MD5 hash is computed and, finally, the middle 16 characters of
the MD5 (changenewsys%04d%02d%02d) hash are the C&C name, after which it
appends .xyz to form the C&C domain. For example:
date = 20210202
changenewsys%04d%02d%02d = changenewsys20210202
MD5(changenewsys20210202) = 65cac0f17c89afb3a5873a7acdcd76df
middle part of MD5 = 7c89afb3a5873a7a.xyz
It then proceeds to report the installation progress to the C&C server to
<C&C>/fine/send. It also reports some information, such as the seller’s ID, infected
machine’s GUID, and the malware version installed, among others.

Figure 11. The installation’s progress is reported to the C&C server; information in the
report includes file type, malware version, seller’s ID, and price.

After sending, it performs several anti-debugging, anti-virtual machine (VM), antianalysis, and system locale (Chinese locale 2052) checks. If the checks fail, it deletes
itself and stops installation. Otherwise, it reports the installation progress again to the
C&C server - <C&C>/info_old/w. Debugged messages are encrypted with data
encryption standard (DES) ciphers key=’rundll32’, IV=’explorer’, and mode=’CBC’, then
URL-safe Base64 encoded. It proceeds to extract the DLL file (which is the third stage)
from the embedded .7Zip compressed blob and runs its exports named Hello001 and
Hello002.
Third stage
This is the main module that implements three export functions. Two of these export
functions are called by the installer in the second stage. The third export function was
unused during the time of our research.
Export function Hello001
This exported function steals Facebook cookies and saved logins from major web
browsers that are installed in the infected system, namely Google Chrome, Firefox,
Opera, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Baidu, and Yandex
In the case of Firefox, it runs a new Firefox process and injects a custom DLL file to
steal the stored data.
For Edge, it decrypts and runs the embedded EdgeCookiesView tool from Nirsoft.
EdgeCookies View is a legitimate tool for Windows that displays the cookies stored
in newer versions of Edge and IE11.
When cookies are available and a user is logged into a social media account, the stealer
then posts various requests to Graph API to obtain additional information, namely the
following:
Facebook user ID cookie
Instagram user ID cookie
Number of Instagram fans
Number of Facebook friends
Facebook payment information
Credit cards
Linked PayPal accounts
Owned business advertising accounts
Facebook pages where the user could be an administrator
Facebook Messenger cookie
Details when the Facebook page was created, among others.
Stolen data is then uploaded to <C&C>/info_old/i for Instagram and
<C&C>/info_old/e for Facebook.

The exported function is also capable of stealing Google cookies, especially Google Ads
cookies, Google payment information, and saved autofill credentials. It uploads stolen
data from these sources to <C&C>/info_old/g. To acquire such information, this
exported function needs to steal cookies and cross-site request forgery (XSRF) tokens
first, after which it will send requests to Google Accounts and ID Administration (GAIA,
via GaiaInfoService.Get). It then proceeds to acquire the details of the current user
(UserByGaiaService.Get) along with a list of services that the user has access to
(UserCustomerAccessService.List).
Stealing social media and Google account information allows the cybercriminals to take
over these accounts and abuse them to conduct false advertising campaigns, as
described here and here.
The stealer also queries <C&C>/info_old/r to find out if there are other cookies that it
can steal. The response is encrypted with the same DES and Base64 algorithm with
characters /=+ replaced with _~- . An example of a response might be
AYYYLksPHjUDgRYoYmagnA~~, which decrypts to ["amazon."] and is then uploaded
to <C&C>/info_old/a.
After stealing all the possible browser information, the stealer installs file-system filter
FsFilter32 or FsFilter64 rootkit to block access to browser-related files (cookie.db,
cookies.sqlite, Login Data, Cookies, WebCacheV01) and processes (explorer.exe,
firefox.exe, chrome.exe, opera.exe, Yandex.exe, baidu.exe, MicrosoftEdge.exe,
MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe, rundll32.exe).
Afterward, it drops the embedded MiniThunderPlatform and loads a xldl.dll file that
runs MiniThunderPlatform.exe with command-line parameters StartTP XL_CreateTask.
Simultaneously, it reads and decrypts <C&C>/info_old/ddd, which is a JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON) that contains the link with another file to load and execute.
After execution, a report is sent to <C&C>/info_old/du. Further analysis showed that
the downloaded file is an Inno installer that contains the Smokeloader/Dofoil malware
loader.

This exported function is a browser extension installer. Particularly, it installs CRX
extensions on Chrome and Opera (resource CRX), and XPI extension on Firefox
(resource FF). All these extensions are stored in the executable’s resources. Resource
FRIENDS — used for scanning the browser if the user is logged into Facebook — is
present but not used. Resource FF is a legitimate Greasemonkey 4.9 extension for
customizing webpages, while resource CRX is an advertisement injector.
The installation of these malicious extensions is done by first killing
the browser process (if it is running) and then extracting the
extension into the default profile:
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
Data\Default\Extensions\ for Chrome and

It then modifies the “Secure Preferences” / “extensions.json” settings file:

Preferences for Chrome and
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xxxx.default-xxxx\ for

CRX extension
As of writing, the Chrome extension was disabled as shown by default. To enable such an
extension, it must be allow-listed in the
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome\ExtensionInstallWhitelist registry key.
This extension is responsible for injecting advertisements into websites and is analyzed
in more detail in its own section.

Similarly, in the case of Firefox, the GreaseMonkey extension is not compatible with the
current Firefox version at the time of writing. Moreover, the pefs.js configuration files

contain references to Firefox China edition add-ons. We are unsure what the purpose of
this is.

Figure 15. The malicious FF extension for Firefox

Facebook FRIENDS extension
We found a malicious browser extension FRIENDS/helper, a Facebook spammer that
posts on victims’ walls, though we did not observe it as being used during our analysis.
This extension checks if a user is logged in to Facebook through the browser. If the
c_user (the user who is currently logged in) cookie is present, then the extension parses
the ads’ manager account settings or management page from where it extracts the access
token.
This token is then used to get information about the
user’s friends using Facebook graph API. Afterward, the
extension queries the C&C about the tasks that it should
perform. The tasks consist of uploading and publishing
a single photo (info.url), the number of friends who will

be tagged on that photo (info.limit), and the description

Management page
that will be attached to the photo (info.message). It
proceeds to report to the C&C about the number of
tagged friends and the total number of friends that the victim has. This occurs
continuously until every friend is tagged in the photos (info.photo_num).
Export function Hello003
This exported function runs a YouTube module (DLL
file) for liking and subscribing to videos. First,
rundll32.exe process is created in suspended mode. This
is followed by the extraction of a 32-bit or 64-bit module
from the main module (from the third stage), which is
injected into the newly created suspended process.

spammer’s parameters as
received from C&C

This function then proceeds to kill the Chrome browser and copies the default profile
directory (User Data) into %APPDATA%\Local\Temp. Afterward, it installs a custom
CRX plug-in (malicious browser extension: CRX/Youtube video) into the directory with
a copied profile. It then starts a new Chrome process with the command line specified as
“User Data” directory with the window positioned out of the screen. It then opens a URL
with a video in that window. The Chrome extension provides the locations of the “Like”
and “Subscribe” buttons, and the YouTube DLL module clicks them. Finally, the Chrome
process is killed and the process with the injected YouTube DLL module shuts down.

video”

Figure 19. Opening a URL with a video

At the time when we were studying this, the given URL was no longer active. However,
further analysis showed that the executable code and Chrome plug-in worked with the
YouTube webpage.
The YouTube DLL module reads the title of the Chrome window and parses the x,y,w,h
coordinates from it. If these values are found, then the module moves the cursor to the
center of the box that is defined by the coordinates and selects that.

Figure 20. The YouTube module parsing for coordinates in the Chrome
window title

The Chrome window title is set by the Chrome browser plug-in. The plug-in first queries
the document to get three selectors: one for choosing the playing video box, another for
choosing the “Subscribe” button, and a last to select the “Like” button. The following is a
sample of what it looks like if we run the selector for the “Subscribe” button in a browser
console.

coordinates identified.

The extension then extracts the position of all three objects, stores them in a JSON
object, and adds a “do” attribute to specify if a click should be made in the middle of the
object. This JSON object is then assigned to the window’s title.

“Subscribe” and “Like” buttons

Browser advertisement injection plug-ins
We analyzed the ad injection browser extension that implement a simple script. We
found that the activity loads the main advertisement injection script (named
<uniqueID>.js) from the script domain C&C server and appends it to the end of the
document body node. Further analysis revealed that the main advertisement script
appeared to be a new version of LNKR ad injector.

Ad injector configuration
We found that the behavior of the ad injection script is configured in
monetizationsConfig. It starts as an empty object and later. various “configuration
blocks” are loaded into it. Each configuration block has a five-character hexadecimal
name (key) with the following attributes:
02aed is the configuration block ID, while
type=platform means that there is an additional script
hosted on the C&C that gets downloaded and executed
only if the particular configuration block ID is present
in the configuration file. The user ID is made up of
random numbers from one to 100. The attribute
“coverage” found toward the middle of the
configuration block identifies which user IDs the
configuration block should be applied to. The URL is a
link where the additional JavaScript will be injected,
while “limit” is the time value (unixtimestamp) in the
future that identifies until when the configuration block
is applied.

Figure 25. Configuration block
attributes

Further down the block, type can be external wherein a script will be loaded to the
website from the external URL. The platform pertains to a script module loaded from
the C&C (script domain), or a plug-in wherein a script loaded to the website is already
embedded in the main ad injection script.
C&C communication
We found a number of communication activities between the browser extension and the
script domain C&C server, especially for reading and setting the subsequent
configurations and reporting various metrics and statistics.
The configuration requests include:
Request

Figure 26. Parameters received
by /optout/get request

Table 2. Some of the parameters returned by
/optout/get request
We found that the preceding parameters decide, in real time, which configuration blocks
should be skipped (or opted out), depending on the configuration block name (key) and
the parameters obtained in /optout/get request. For example, if lcFlag (internally named
as ownMonetizationsClickFlag) is set to “true,” then only one of several hard-coded
configuration names (keys) are loaded. Meanwhile, the configuration keys that are not
mentioned in the part of the main script responsible for processing lcFlag are skipped
(opted out).
After processing all the platform blocks, the parameters that are not opted out will be
loaded from /ext/<uniqueID>.js?sid=<source ID>&title=<title>&&blocks[]=<platform
block keys>. The purpose of platform blocks is to enable additional functionalities based
on /optout/get results and the domain currently loaded in the browser window. This
functionality is provided by additional scripts hosted directly on the script domain C&C.
In the scenario that we observed during our research, /ext/<uniqueID>.js request
returns another script. This script loads an obfuscated BetterJsPop library with
capabilities of creating pop-under, pop-up, and tab-under ads. The configuration here
shows that an ad URL will appear under in a new tab.

In the next request, the /ext/ scripts queries the ad link where the user should be
redirected to from from /ext/__utm.gif?a=…&ajax. The following request is embedded
in parameter “a” of the GET request and encrypted with XOR with a decimal key of 77. If
the response for the request is “true”, it returns a JSON object with a “url” key
containing the first URL of the redirection chain.
/trgt/ is a request for targeting,
specifically whether a plug-in should be
injected into the webpage or not. In our
case, a response from the request to
/trgt/ lists plug-ins to be loaded in the
“rows” key.

External ad injection scripts
As mentioned in the previous section, the configuration blocks can be one of three types:
external, platform, or plug-in. In this section, we discuss our findings on a few external
ad injection scripts.
Script 1: Pre-rendering links
This script pre-renders selected links on the webpage. If a user selects any of these preselected links, the script performs a “click” on the affiliated URL, then performs a “click”
on the original link after a while.
Pre-rendering a website consists of the following:
1. Attaching a click handler (addEventListener) to handle a user’s clicks on links;
2. If the user selects anchor element A (link) or AREA element and if special keys like
CTRL, SHIFT, or ALT are not selected, then
a) It further considers if the link is writable (that is, if it is not an image, not an excluded
domain, or not an inner link within the same domain)
b) If the special link attributes are not set (for example, lnkr_redirecting, data-ad-flag),
then the act of tapping or selecting a link will be processed
Selecting the link means the following:
1. A request is made for an additional script to be downloaded and executed. The
format of the requested URL’s additional parameters are stub=<random number>,
out=< encoded original URL link>.
2. The server returns the script associated with the original URL link.
3. The downloaded script is inserted before the HEAD tag, wherein this script is
loaded to the document as soon as it is downloaded.
4. After three seconds, a redirection is performed, wherein
a) lnkr_redirecting attribute is set and for about one second removed to and from the
link that a victim originally selected.
b) The original link is selected.
Script 2: Frame link injector
This creates an empty (about:blank) iframe that is located out of the screen (-999px,
-999px). The script injector then creates a link within the newly created iframe and then
selects this.

screen (top) and the creation of a link (bottom)

Script 3: Loader of another Yontoo-based ad injection framework
This is an additional ad injection framework consisting of two stages of loaders,
configuration files, and many additional scripts (items/platforms).
Based on previous documentation, this seems to be an ad injection framework that is
likely based on a previous version of a Yontoo ad injector. The execution starts with the
first-stage loader (l.js?pid=<partner ID>&ext=) based on a four-digit partner ID value. It
then loads the second-stage loader from /loaders/<partner ID>/l.js?pid=<partner
ID>&ext=&zoneid=<zoneid>. Advertising zones are places in webpage layouts where ad
content is displayed.
The second-stage loader, which might vary for different partner IDs, embeds two JSON
objects with various configuration item (or platform) values. The first object lists country
codes (or ALL for all countries, with two letters for identifying a specific country) and the
corresponding configuration items (platforms). The second object is a subset of
configuration items from the first object where additional scripts (named <item ID>.js)
are downloaded and injected into websites.
The subset of item IDs could include either a JavaScript code (see
the following ybeb1 case) or an empty string, which instructs the
second-stage loader to download additional injection scripts from
/i/items/<item ID>/js/<item ID>.js.
Meanwhile, the second stage loader also loads a “permission file”
from /loaders/icp and domain-specific rules for the currently
loaded domain from /js/<reverse(hex(domainName))>/r.js.

Domain-specific rules once again contain an array of permission types (key t) and a list
of possible subdomains (key s) with indices to the array of permission types t. Based on
each domain permission types, item (platform) IDs are either activated or not, which
could lead to downloading and injecting additional JS scripts.

Some of the permissions are listed here. Although this list is not complete and we did not
decode the meaning of all the permissions included, we can at least guess the relation of
some of them to various advertisement networks.

Observed behaviors
Here we list some of the behaviors that can result from what the ad injection frameworks
can do, just to name a few:
Subscribe to Facebook groups
Exfiltrate various search engines’ search field inputs
Redirect these searches to the custom search engines
Display their own monetized search results

Inject iframes with advertisement banners
Perform a chain of redirections before reaching the originally entered user’s URL
Replacing ad exchange IDs means that the revenue for displaying the ads do not go to
the original publisher (website creator) but to the adware operator. The following code
shows the youradexchange.com parameter replacing and appending Yandex Market
Partner ID (&clid=<value>) to monetize Yandex searches.

Here is a sample of Amazon searches that are exfiltrated every time a victim enters
something in the search box. The keywords are exflitrated inside “custom” variables.

Here we show a custom search engine that is used for hijacking searches from Yahoo,
go.mail.ru, and rambler searches to a custom search engine.

We also found a transparent element capturing the act of tapping or selecting while
overlaying on the entire screen. This example shows the Google homepage with a
transparent element over the whole window area. Hovering over the overlaying object
using the browser’s console highlights the transparent element (seen in blue).

ConclusionFrom a cybercriminal’s perspective, the distribution of pirated software and
cracks is a viable way of spreading malicious software. The stealer presents interesting
capabilities, considering the main goal of acquiring various cookies and taking control of
advertisement accounts. This grants the threat actor the ability to spread advertisements
that bring their malware and adware to more potential victims. It also promotes
cybercriminals’ other “products” from which they can also profit. Of course, stolen
cookies from browsers give them sensitive personal information that they can further
monetize illegally, especially in the underground.

Heavy use of browser plug-ins allows threat actors to inject ads and modify websites
behaviors. As they replace legitimate advertiser IDs with theirs, the returns for clicks, ad
views, searches, and downloads redirect the supposed profits of the legitimate parties,
thereby resulting to bigger losses for them. This also adds another channel of
monetization to this campaign. As of writing, we are unsure if the PPI websites and
networks are aware of these cybercriminal campaigns involving their sites.
Here are some best practices to prevent these kinds of threats:
Avoid searching for or downloading applications and pirated software using
dubious third-party websites. Look for legitimate tools and programs from official
app stores, especially those stores with a lot of user-created reviews.
If possible, avoid storing sensitive information such as banking or access
credentials in browsers or platforms for auto-filling forms. Whenever possible,
regularly delete the browser cache of machines that you often use.
Some of the findings here were similarly previously published.
Trend Micro solutions
Users can protect their systems from these kinds of threats with a multilayered
protection system to block and detect known and unknown threats. Since dubious
websites and fraudsters attempt to deceive users by making seemingly harmless,
genuine-looking apps, mitigate risks by choosing to download applications and software
from official websites and legitimate marketplaces.
