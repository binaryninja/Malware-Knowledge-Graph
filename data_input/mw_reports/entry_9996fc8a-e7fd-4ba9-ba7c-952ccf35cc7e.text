Follow the story of Company X as they suffer an attack from the notorious modern ransomware family,
Nefilim, and their affiliates, to learn how you can better mitigate against the common tactic and techniques
used in these attacks.
By: Trend Micro June 28, 2021 Read time: ( words)

Nefilim is among a new breed of ransomware families that use advanced techniques for a more targeted
and virulent attack. It is operated by a group that we track under the intrusion set "Water Roc". This group
combines advanced techniques with legitimate tools to make them significantly harder to detect and
respond before it is too late.
This allows them to remain undetected in the system for weeks, navigating across the environment to
maximize their damage. Before the attack is even initiated, deep victim profiling is done, allowing them to
use victim-specific extortion pricing to tailor the ransom.
Nefilim is a Ransomware as a Service(RaaS) operation first discovered in March 2020, and believed to
have evolved from the earlier Nemty ransomware family. They target multi-billion dollar companies, primarily
based in North or South America, in the financial, manufacturing or transportation industries. They operate
under a profit share model, where Nefilim earns 30% for their ransomware service, and the remaining 70%
goes to the affiliates who provide the network access and implements the active phase of the attack.
Like all ransomware, recovery is dependent on an external backup drive or paying for the encryption key, as
Nefilim ransomware replaces the original files with encrypted versions.

Along with a new wave of double extortion ransomware families, Nefilim affiliates are particularly vicious
when victims don’t immediately pay the ransom, leaking their sensitive data over an extended period of
time. They are one of few groups that host leaked victim data long-term, for months to years, using it to
deliver a chilling message to future victims.
The following is a fictional use case built using an in-depth case study of the Nefilim ransomware family to
demonstrate how their typical attack process occurs. The story leverages the MITRE ATT&CK Framework
to define each tactic and technique used, with a detailed table below for further technical information.
Victim Use Case of Nefilim
Meet Company X, a fictional company serving the purpose of being the victim of a typical Nefilim
ransomware attack. Company X is a global manufacturing organization with a yearly revenue of US$1
Billion and headquartered in North America, making them an ideal target of Nefilim.
Infiltrating the Environment
During their active vulnerability scanning (T1595.002) of Company X’s internet facing hosts, the adversaries
find that X has not patched a Citrix Application Delivery Controller vulnerability (CVE-2019-19781). This is a
vulnerability they can exploit to gain initial access (T1133) through the exposed Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP), and so the attack begins!
X’s security team should have maintained an inventory of their exposed services across their environment,
periodically scanning for vulnerabilities so they can proactively mitigate any potential inroads to their
network. Internet-facing systems such as Citrix should always be a patching priority and managed with
strong access controls. Access can be limited with a least-privileged administrative model and a strong
multifactor authentication system (M1032) to strengthen account security and prevent credential access. If
the RDP is unnecessary, which may be why it was left unpatched, then it should be disabled or blocked
(M1042). Network proxies, gateways, and firewalls can also be leveraged to deny direct remote access to
the internal system, blocking the inroad by which the adversaries are entering.
Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can provide an additional layer of protection in advance of patch
availability or patch deployment, which is particularly important with preventing targeted ransomware
attacks, such as this one. IPS logs also provide relevant information for detecting initial access activities.
Once the actors have successfully infiltrated X’s network, they begin downloading the additional tools they
will need to further their plot (T1608). They download a Cobalt Strike beacon to establish a backdoor and
persistent access to the environment so they can remotely execute commands, and later exfiltrate the data.
This beacon is connected back to one of their pre-established shell companies that hosts their Cobalt Strike
Command and Control (C&C) server. They also download Process Hacker to stop endpoint security agents
(T1489), and Mimikatz to dump credentials (T1003.001), along with other tools they will need throughout
their attack.
The adversaries need elevated permissions to run certain tools as administrators. They take advantage of
another unpatched vulnerability in X’s system (T1068), a Windows COM Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
(CVE-2017-0213). Armed with elevated permissions and credentials courtesy of Mimikatz, they are ready to
continue their invasion.
The use of multiple vulnerabilities that were disclosed several years ago is a reminder of the importance of
timely software updating (M1051) and patch management. A threat intelligence program can be developed
to help identify what software exploits and N-day vulnerabilities may have the most impact on an
organization (M1019). Virtual patching programs can enhance existing patch management processes to
2/16

further defend against known and unknown vulnerabilities. Application isolation and sandboxing can also be
used to mitigate the impact of advisories taking advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities (M1048). Ultimately,
an organization needs good application security that looks for and detects exploitation behavior.
Mimikatz is a popular tool used for credential dumping of plaintext passwords, hashes, Kerberos tickets and
other sensitive data from memory. It can also be used to gain access to other systems within the network
through a pass-the-hash attack (T1550). However, Mimikatz has no major legitimate use that would explain
admins having it on their system, so this tool should be treated as suspicious in most cases.
Mitigations can be established through strict account management and Active Directory Audit
Policies. Enforcing the least-privileged administrative Model (M1018) and limiting credential overlap (M1026)
across systems helps to further prevent compromised credential enabling lateral movement.
Completing the Invasion
The attackers take advantage of tools that already exist in the system to move laterally and expand their
invasion (T1570). They use PsExec to launch taskkill to stop services that could alert X’s security team, and
to stop backup services (T1489). AdFind gives them vital information about the active directory setup which
they use to map out X’s infrastructure and find other targets of interest (T1018). Over time, they move
throughout X’s entire environment, including peripheral devices (T1120) and shared drives (T1135),
identifying all the valuable data (T1083), and then using PowerShell commands, they strategically drop
Cobalt Strike beacons in specific systems important to their attack as they go.
Network intrusion detection and prevention systems (M1031) are critical to mitigate adversary activity after
initial access at the network level. These systems can help security teams see that they’ve been breached
and track the attacker’s activities with sensors at the network, cloud, and endpoint/server layers. Network
segmentation and micro segmentation can help to inhibit lateral movement and support security monitoring.
Exfiltration for Encryption
The attackers use automated exfiltration (T1020) with their existing C&C channels established with the
Cobalt Strike beacons set up across X’s environment (T1041). The sensitive data is stolen using file transfer
protocols (FTP) in fixed size chucks to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts (T1030). For
any large files, they use mega.nz to callback the data over the legitimate web service (T1567).
To prevent the exfiltration of data, web-based content can be restricted (M1021) and network traffic can be
filtered (M1037). Any suspicious DNS, HTTP and HTTPS connections should be monitored or blocked
entirely. AV software should also be kept up-to-date with machine learning plug-ins. As a rule of thumb, it is
important to block any traffic to a Cobalt Strike C&C server, however since Cobalt Strike is designed to
evade security measures, a multilayer approach is needed for this to be effective.
Execution of Ransomware
After a few weeks, the attackers are satisfied that they have identified all valuable data within X’s
environment. They wait until a weekend to help ensure they remain undetected, and then they deploy the
Nefilim ransomware on X’s network. The ransom note is prepared for decryption, then Nefilim imports an
RSA-2048 public key and leaves it ready to use for encryption. The Nefilim payload is executed with a
command-line argument (T1059) containing the full path of directory with the files identified to be encrypted.
All of X’s logical drives are encrypted, and a decrypted ransom note named “NEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt” is
written for each one.

3/16

Before starting to encrypt the files, Nefilim checks if they match its exclusion list of files and directory names.
With this confirmed, Nefilim encrypts the file contents (T1486), and then replaces the original content with
the encrypted version. After which it erases the encryption keys from memory and removes itself 3 seconds
after, deleting its path.

Company X’s CISO returns to work after a relaxing weekend to find her worst nightmare. She has been the
victim of a Nefilim ransomware attack.

After verifying the attack, she receives the ransom specifically tailored to her company for maximum
extortion. She must now make the toughest decision of her career; does she pay the ransom? Or risk all of
Company X’s sensitive data being leaked and the lawsuit that will follow that?
How Could This Have Been Prevented?
When evaluating your protection against ransomware, you should start with auditing your ability to detect
the impact techniques. This tactic is used to attempt to inhibit an organization’s recovery ability and the
techniques used are the best indicators of a potential ransomware attack. Nefilim ransomware binaries are
straightforward, so general ransomware mitigation techniques would protect against this ransomware family.
The adversaries stopped services throughout the lifecycle of their attack over several weeks (T1489). These
actions could be prevented with permission restrictions (M1022 & M1024) and network segmentation
(M1030) techniques. The risk of an attacker seeing and interfering with critical response functions can be
decreased by separating the networks that operate intrusion detection, analysis and response systems from
the production environment. Critical services can be protected from interference or being disabled by
attackers by restricting registry and directory permissions. Ultimately, secure account management (M1018)
is important to ensure only authorized admins have access to critical services.
Organization’s security teams can also consider developing disaster recovery plans for situations like a
successful ransomware attack. These plans can also contain proactive processes such as routine data
back-up (M1053) and testing the security of the back-up drives that can be used to recover from an attack.

4/16

These back-ups should be stored securely off the system and versioning enabled in cloud environments to
make copies of the backups. However, this does not stop the stolen data from being leaked, so prevention
is key with modern ransomware attacks.
The Answer to Modern Ransomware Prevention
With most organizations using multiple, separate security layers, threat information is siloed, with an endless
amount of uncorrelated alerts. This results in a lack of visibility, making it extremely difficult to connect the
traces of advanced ransomware attacks in time to prevent it. To stay ahead of modern attack techniques, a
solution that can look across the entire environment, correlate suspicious activity, and detect critical threats
with quality alerts is essential.
We have answered the challenge of modern ransomware with a purpose-built threat defense extended
detection and response (XDR) solution, Trend Micro Vision One. It uses native sensors and protection
points — coupled with XDR capabilities to stitch together threat activity across layers — enabling you to
quickly identify complex attacks, like Nefilim ransomware, that bypass traditional prevention. This provides
you with the ability to run root cause analysis, look at the execution profile, and identify the scope of the
impact across your environment. With a broader perspective and better context to hunt, detect and contain
threats with fewer, higher quality alerts so you can see more and respond faster.
