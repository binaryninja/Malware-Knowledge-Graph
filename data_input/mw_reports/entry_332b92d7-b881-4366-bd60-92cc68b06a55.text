One of the most common tricks scammers use in phishing attacks is to create a fake official
page of a famous brand. Attackers tend to copy design elements from the real website,
which is why users can find it hard to distinguish the fake pages from the official ones. Even
phishing page domain name can often look like the real web address of a certain brand, as
cybercriminals include the name of the company or service they are posing as in the URL.
This trick is known as combosquatting.

“facebook.com”
Given phishing websites can be efficiently blocked or added to anti-phishing databases,
cybercriminals have to generate these pages quickly and in large numbers. Creating them
from scratch over and over again is time-consuming, and not all cybercriminals have the
web-development and administration skills it takes. That is why cybercriminals favor phishing
kits, which are like model aircraft or vehicle assembly kits. They consist of ready-made
templates and scripts which can be used to create phishing pages quickly and on a massive
scale. Phishing kits are fairly easy to use, which is why even inexperienced attackers who do
not have any technical skills can get their heads around them.
Cybercriminals tend to use hacked official websites to host pages generated using the
phishing kits or rely on companies which offer free web-hosting providers. The latter are
constantly working to combat phishing and block the fake pages, although phishing websites
often manage to serve the intended purpose within their short period of activity, which is to
collect and send personal data of victims to criminals.

Contents of phishing kits: basic and complex phishing kits
Phishing kits are ready-to-deploy packages which require the bare minimum effort to use.
Moreover, their developers usually provide instructions with their products for inexperienced
attackers. Phishing kits usually are designed to generate copies of websites representing
famous brands with large audiences. After all, the more potential victims there are, the more
money there is to be stolen. The phishing kits we detected in 2021 most frequently created
copies of Facebook, the Dutch banking group ING, the German bank Sparkasse, as well as
Adidas and Amazon.

The most basic option phishing kits offer is a ready-made phishing page which is fairly simple
to upload on a web-hosting service.

Contents of simple phishing-kit archive
These phishing kits have two essential components for practical reasons:
1. An HTML page with a phishing data-entry form and related content (style, images,
scripts and other multimedia components). Attackers aim to make the page look
identical to pages on the company’s official website whose users they want to target in
the attack. However, the fake page’s HTML code differs from the original code.
2. The phishing script that sends data victims enter on the fake page to cybercriminals. It
is usually a simple script which parses the phishing data-entry form. In the phishing
script’s code, cybercriminals also indicate the Telegram bot authentication token, e-mail
address or other third-party online resources where stolen data will be sent using the
phishing kit. The phishing kit’s creators often comment the line where an address or
token needs to be entered.

Instead of providing ready-to-load pages, more sophisticated phishing kits contain their
elements (images, forms, phishing script, text fragments etc.), along with a separate script
which creates new pages from these elements.

There are also advanced phishing packages which not only come with all the tools and
elements needed to assemble the web pages, but also include a control center with a user
interface. Attackers can use this control center to tailor how a phishing page functions, e.g.,
by specifying how they would like to receive stolen data. Some sophisticated phishing kits
allow to generate pages which target users from different countries using a built-in dictionary
containing the same phrases in different languages.

In addition to tools for attackers to create phishing pages themselves, some phishing kits can
include scripts for sending out messages to potential victims via popular messaging apps or
e-mail which contain links to phishing pages. These mailings tend to be the go-to channel
cybercriminals use to get their pages out there. The contact details of potential victims can
be found on the dark web, where a colossal amount of databases are sold which detail
clients of various companies and services.
Many of the scripts for sending out messages included in phishing kits or sold separately can
add a URL parameter in the links which contains the recipient’s e-mail address. This
parameter is used extensively in corporate phishing attacks. Some known phishing kits
which target the corporate sector are able to capture the e-mail domain located in the URL
parameter and generate a phishing page tailored to this domain name. There are several
common ways to deploy this dynamic content generation:
The text on the page adapts to the domain name, which makes it look more
personalized to increase the victim’s trust.

Icons are loaded from the Internet which are related to the victim’s domain name,
where the domain itself is essentially the key word used in a search request to load
icons.

Anti-detection methods
Some sophisticated phishing kits include functional elements which prevent a page from
being accessed by unwelcome agents, such as bots used by known anti-phishing solution
developers or search engines. The latter are unwelcome, because if a phishing page ends
up being a search-result hit, there’s a high risk it’ll soon get blocked.

Apart from that, some of the phishing kits we detected used geoblocking. For example,
phishing attacks written in Japanese had pages which could only be opened from Japanese
IP addresses. Blocking tended to be triggered by the detection of the User Agent string,
which identifies the user’s browser, or based on their IP address, although there are also
some technologies which analyze request headers. This was all done in order to reduce the
risk of detection by bots from the developers of anti-phishing solutions scanning the phishing
page, and to avoid ending up in anti-phishing databases.
Some phishing kits add various obfuscation options for the generated pages and pure “junk”
code which aims to make it harder for anti-phishing solutions to detect and block these
pages. Some tricks worth highlighting include:

9/17

Caesar cipher. Every character in the text is replaced by a character which is a fixed
number of positions further along in the alphabet. This results in the text in the original
code of the phishing page looking like alphabet soup, but when the page is loaded the
shift reverts back and the user sees the page with normal decoded text. The script for
implementing Caesar code is written by the creators of the phishing kits themselves.

Code of a page with text encrypted in Caesar code
Page source encoding. Text or even the page’s entire HTML code is encoded using
an algorithm such as base64 or AES and decoded on the browser’s end. Unlike
Caesar code, the algorithms for decoding and decrypting data in the phishing kit’s code
are implemented using standard libraries.

10/17

Invisible HTML tags. A large amount of code is added to the page which does not do
anything during the rendering process when code becomes what’s visible on screen —
its aim is to make the page harder to detect. See the example below, where chunks of
text are hidden among junk HTML tags which do not appear on screen according to the
information in the style sheet.

Junk HTML tags

11/17

String slicing. Cutting a string into groups of characters which can be rearranged, and
referring to characters by their number in a code table instead of explicitly writing them
out. A massive puzzle of these substrings is pieced together when a page is loaded to
form the full string.

String slicing: concealing malicious links in code
Randomized HTML attributes. The randomization of tag attribute values which then
have no further use in the code. This is used to trick anti-phishing technologies which
work by analyzing layout: when a page’s code contains a lot of variable attributes, the
detection rules the technology relies on cannot count all of them because the
probability of making a false detection is too high.
It is also worth mentioning that similar forms of obfuscation can also be used by the
developers of phishing kits themselves with the aim of getting hold of data their clients have
managed to collect using their product. In this case, it is not the text of the phishing page
that’s obfuscated, but the code responsible for transferring information back to the creator of
the phishing kit is made obscure to prevent the client using the kit from understanding it.
These methods may aim to prevent anti-phishing solutions from finding clues in the original
page which would allow them to classify it as a phishing page. However, we have learned
how to detect and successfully block these fake pages using deep automated analysis of
content.

Phishing-kit pricing and marketplace

12/17

Phishing kits can be purchased on insider forums on the dark web or through private
Telegram channels. Prices vary and more often than not depend on the level of
sophistication and quality a particular kit has to offer. For instance, phishing kits up for sale
on one Telegram channel are priced from USD 50 to 900. Moreover, some phishing kits are
freely available online.

Phishing kits are also sold as part of software-as-a-service (SaaS) package. It’s dubbed
Phishing-as-a-Service (PHaaS) and lately it’s been growing more popular. The packages
consist of a wide range of specialized scamming services: from the creation of fake websites
posing as a popular brand to launching a targeted data-theft campaign. This includes
studying the target audience, sending out phishing messages, as well as encrypting and
sending the stolen data to the client.
For example, one online resource offering Phishing-as-a-Service has a phishing kit for
stealing login credentials from a Microsoft account using an invitation to view an Excel
document as bait, which can be purchased for a relatively small sum of money. The seller

guarantees the product has been tried and tested on all device types. It claims 100% of
buyers were satisfied with the quality of the product, and promises to send the victim’s data
via e-mail.

Statistics
Last year we detected 469 individual phishing kits, which allowed us to block 1.2 million
phishing websites. The graph below shows the dynamics of the TOP 10 phishing kits we
detected over a period from August 2021 to January 2022, along with the number of unique
domains where each of these phishing kits were encountered. Overall, the number of unique
domains where we detected content unboxed from phishing kits exceeded 25,000 in
October.

Based on the data presented here, we can conclude that some phishing kits are used fairly
extensively and survive for a rather long time, while others are no longer visible after a month
or two.

Conclusion and advice
Scammers often rely on phishing kits to orchestrate phishing campaigns, especially those
who are inexperienced and have a poor grasp of programming. They are relatively simple
tools for quickly creating fake websites and collecting the data cybercriminals steal using
them. Some kits can also include tools for sending out phishing e-mails, a control panel and
dictionaries to localize the phishing attacks.
Cybercriminals usually get their phishing kits from forums on the dark web or closed
Telegram channels. Scammers who are poor or on a tight budget can find some basic opensource tools accessible online. Those who are better-off can commission Phishing-as-aService, which often includes various phishing kits.
Last year alone, we detected and blocked around 1.2 million phishing pages created using
phishing kits. In addition to no-frills phishing kits, we encountered more sophisticated ones
which had anti-bot features, geoblocking and anti-detection methods, such as obfuscation
and junk code.

Phishing websites are most frequently circulated in spam campaigns via e-mail or messaging
app. We recommend users take the following precautions to avoid getting reeled in by the
phishers:
Treat links in e-mails and messages sent by people you don not know with suspicion,
as well as “viral” messages which prompt you to forward them to a set number of your
contacts. Avoid clicking on links where possible and manually type out the URL in the
address bar instead or open the app in question.
Before entering your login credentials on a website, make sure the URL in the address
bar is correct.
Use a reliable security solution which blocks attempts to follow links leading to phishing
websites.
We recommend companies keep track of new phishing kits targeting their clients or
employees. You can receive information about phishing kits through services which provide
data about cyberthreats, such as Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal.
