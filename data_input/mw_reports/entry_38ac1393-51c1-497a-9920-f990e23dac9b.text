Suspected Iranian Actor Targeting Israeli Shipping,
Healthcare, Government and Energy Sectors
mandiant.com/resources/suspected-iranian-actor-targeting-israeli-shipping

Background
Over the last year Mandiant has been tracking UNC3890, a cluster of activity targeting Israeli
shipping, government, energy and healthcare organizations via social engineering lures and
a potential watering hole. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence this actor is linked to
Iran, which is notable given the strong focus on shipping and the ongoing naval conflict
between Iran and Israel. While we believe this actor is focused on intelligence collection, the
collected data may be leveraged to support various activities, from hack-and-leak, to
enabling kinetic warfare attacks like those that have plagued the shipping industry in recent
years.
Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that UNC3890 conducts espionage and
intelligence collection activity to support multiple Iranian interests and operations. Targeting
patterns indicate a strong interest in Israeli entities and organizations of various sectors,
including government, shipping, energy and healthcare. We observed several limited
technical connections to Iran, such as PDB strings and Farsi language artifacts.
This campaign has been active since at least late 2020, and is still ongoing as of mid-2022,
and though it is regional in nature, targeted entities include global companies.

UNC3890 uses at least two unique tools: a backdoor which we named SUGARUSH, and a
browser credential stealer, which exfiltrates stolen data via Gmail, Yahoo and Yandex email
services that we’ve named SUGARDUMP. UNC3890 also uses multiple publicly available
tools, such as the METASPLOIT framework and NorthStar C2.
In addition, Mandiant discovered UNC3890 operates an inter-connected network of
Command-and-Control (C2) servers. The C2 servers host domains and fake login pages
spoofing legitimate services such as Office 365, social networks such as LinkedIn and
Facebook, as well as fake job offers and fake commercials for AI-based robotic dolls. We
observed the C2 servers communicating with multiple targets, as well as with a watering hole
that we believe was targeting the Israeli shipping sector, in particular entities that handle and
ship sensitive components.
This blog post details the activity of UNC3890, including their proprietary malware, TTPs we
have not previously seen deployed by Iran, and the publicly available tools we identified in
our investigation. Mandiant continues to track UNC3890 as well as other potentially related
clusters of activity by the same threat actor.

Attribution
Mandiant uses the label “UNC” groups – or “uncategorized” groups – to refer to a cluster of
intrusion activity that includes observable artifacts, such as adversary infrastructure , tools,
and tradecraft that we are not yet ready to give a classification such as TEMP, APT, or FIN
(learn more about how Mandiant tracks uncategorized threat actors). Mandiant found no
significant connections between UNC3890 and other clusters of activities we currently track,
and therefore sees it as a standalone group. However, we identified several connections
suggesting the activity is conducted by an Iran-nexus group:
Usage of Farsi words, as observed in strings left by the developers in the newest
version of SUGARDUMP, for example “KHODA” (the Farsi word for “God”) and “yaal”
(the Farsi word for a horse’s mane).
Focused targeting of Israeli entities and organizations, or organizations operating in
Israel, consistent with other clusters of activity operated by Iranian threat actors,
specifically UNC757.
Usage of the same PDB path as another Iranian cluster of activity Mandiant tracks as
UNC2448 (operated by the Iranian IRGC, according to public sources), publicly
referred to in a U.S. government statement from November 17, 2021. Several
publications suggested that UNC2448 is linked to APT35/Charming Kitten cluster of
activities, which according to several public sources is operated by the Iranian Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). UNC2448 has been targeting Israeli entities as
well, among other countries of interest to Iran.

2/18

Utilization of NorthStar C2 Framework, a C2 framework preferred by other Iranian
actors . However, since it is a publicly available framework used by multiple threat
actors, we consider this link circumstantial.

Targeting
In late 2021, Mandiant identified UNC3890 targeting Israeli entities and showing interest in
various sectors, including government, shipping, energy, aviation and healthcare. Even
though the targeting we observed is focused to Israel, some of the entities targeted by
UNC3890, especially in the shipping sector, are global companies. Therefore, the potential
impact of UNC3890 activity described in this blog may extend beyond Israel. The activity is
consistent with historical Iranian interest in these targets. Targeting patterns and lures used
by UNC3890 indicate an attempt to disguise their activity as legitimate login activity,
legitimate services and social network applications, and technology-related visual content.

Malware Observed
Mandiant observed UNC3890 deploy the following malware families.

Outlook and Implications
UNC3890 has been operating since at least late 2020. Their focused targeting poses a threat
to Israel-based organizations and entities, particularly those affiliated with the government,
shipping, energy, aviation and healthcare sectors. While we are not aware of targeting
outside Israel, it is possible such targeting has occurred, or will occur. UNC3890 utilization of
legitimate or publicly available tools, in addition to their unique exfiltration method using
Gmail, Yahoo and Yandex email addresses, may reflect their efforts to evade detection and
to bypass heuristics or network-based security measures.

UNC3890 Attack Lifecycle
Establish Foothold
While Mandiant primarily identified post-exploitation implants utilized by UNC3890, there are
some findings that shed light about their initial access methodologies. Mandiant identified
UNC3890 potentially used the following initial access vectors:
Watering holes – Mandiant identified a potential watering hole hosted on a login page
of a legitimate Israeli shipping company, which was likely compromised by UNC3890.
The watering hole was active at least until November 2021, and upon entering the
legitimate login page, the user would be sending a POST request with preliminary data
about the logged user to an attacker controlled non-ASCII Punycode domain
(lirıkedin[.]com, interpreted as xn--lirkedin-vkb[.]com).
The URL structure of the POST request:
hxxps[:]//xn--lirkedin-vkb[.]com/object[.]php?browser=<user_browser>&ip=<user_ip>
When we inspected the watering hole, it was already inactive, but it was most likely used to
target clients and users of that Israeli shipping company, in particular, one’s shipping or
handling heat-sensitive cargo (based on the nature of the compromised website). We have
an additional indication of an attempted targeting of another major Israeli shipping company
by UNC3890, which is consistent with the watering hole.

4/18

Credentials harvesting by masquerading as legitimate services – we uncovered
several domains resolving to UNC3890’s C2 servers. Some of the domains were
masquerading as legitimate services and entities, as can be observed in the table
below. UNC3890 may have used these domains to harvest credentials to legitimate
services, to send phishing lures, or to overall mask their activity and blend in with
expected network traffic.
It should be noted that many of these domains were hosted on the same infrastructure used
by UNC3890, but date back to late 2020, which is before we can corroborate UNC3890 has
been active.

In addition, we identified an UNC3890 server that hosted several ZIP files containing scraped
contents of Facebook and Instagram accounts of legitimate individuals. It is possible they
were targeted by UNC3890, or used as lures in a social engineering effort.

Fake job offers, potentially as part of a phishing or watering hole campaign – we observed
UNC3890 utilize a .xls lure file designed as a fake job offer (MD5:
639f83fa4265ddbb43e85b763fe3dbac) which installs SUGARDUMP, a credential harvesting
tool. The job offer was for a software developer position in LexisNexis, a company offering a
data analytics solution.

Fake commercials for AI-based robotic dolls – one of UNC3890’s most recent
endeavor to target victims includes the usage of a video commercial for AI-based
robotic dolls, used as a lure to deliver SUGARDUMP. In addition, we observed
UNC3890 usage of domains with similar themes such as naturaldolls[.]store (hosting a
fake Outlook login page) and xxx-doll[.]com. In addition, UNC3890 infrastructure
hosted a fake page for the alleged purchasing of robotic dolls, redirecting victims to an
attacker controlled infrastructure.

Post-Exploitation: From Credentials Harvesting to Full Access and Control
After gaining initial access, UNC3890 utilizes a broad toolset to access and control the
victim’s environment. In this sector we will focus on the analysis of two of UNC3890’s
proprietary tools we identified in our investigation: the SUGARUSH backdoor, and the
SUGARDUMP credential harvesting tool. We will also provide a brief analysis of the public
tools utilized by UNC3890.

8/18

Most of the tools were available for download directly from UNC3890 controlled
infrastructure, indicating they may have been served as 1st stage implants. Alternatively, they
may have been used as 2nd stages (or later), but UNC3890 may have misconfigured their
infrastructure, making it publicly accessible.
SUGARUSH Analysis: A Small But Efficient Backdoor
SUGARUSH is a small custom backdoor that establishes a reverse shell over TCP to a
hardcoded C&C address.
Upon first execution, SUGARUSH will create a new service called “Service1”. Subsequently,
SUGARUSH creates a logging folder called “Logs”, and stores it under its current execution
path. A new folder named
“ServiceLog” is created in the “Logs” folder, and a new log file is written with the message
“Service is started at <current_date>”. The name of the log files is the current date of the
infected machine.
SUGARUSH will then check for internet connectivity of the host and will create a log file
indicating the result with message “You are online at <current_date>” or “You are offline at
<current_date>”. If the attempt for internet connection is successful, SUGARUSH will
establish a new TCP connection to an embedded C&C address via port 4585.
SUGARUSH then waits to receive an answer from the C2 which will be interpreted as a CMD
command for execution.

SUGARDUMP Analysis: A Browser Credential Harvesting Tool
SUGARDUMP is a small custom utility used for harvesting credentials from Chrome, Opera
and Edge Chromium browsers.
When executed SUGARDUMP will access the following paths:
%AppData%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data
%AppData&\\Opera Software\\Opera Stable
%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data
Out of each path SUGARDUMP will attempt collect specific folders:

9/18

\\Default\\Login Data
\\Login Data
Any other folder that has the string “Profile” in its name.
Afterwards, SUGARDUMP will extract all of the available usernames and passwords from
these folders.
The collected information is subsequently stored in the following format:

Figure 5: SUGARDUMP exfiltrated data format
We observed several versions of SUGARDUMP:
SUGARDUMP first known version, dated to early 2021. This early version stores the
credentials without exfiltrating them. It is possible it was an unfinished version, or that
UNC3890 used other tools and/or manually connect to the victim to exfiltrate the stolen
credentials.
SUGARDUMP using SMTP-based communication, dated to late 2021-early 2022. This
version utilizes Yahoo, Yandex and Gmail addresses for exfiltration, and uses a
commercial AI-driven robotic dolls as a lure.
SUGARDUMP using HTTPs-based communication, dated to April 2022. This version
uses a fake NexisLexis job offer as a lure.
SUGARDUMP first known version – dated to early 2021, we observed two variants of this
version: the first one saves the stolen credentials under in a .txt file under the path:
“C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\test2.txt”. The second variant prints the stolen credentials as a
CMD output.
We observed two PDB paths contained in SUGARDUMP samples:
C:\Users\User\source\repos\passrecover\passrecover\obj\Release\passrecover.pdb –
we observed a similar PDB path (the part in bold) used in a toolset (for example, MD5:
69b2ab3369823032991d4b306a170425) by UNC2448, an actor affiliated with Iran,
which was mentioned in a U.S. government statement in November 17, 2021. Since
this is a rather generic PDB path, this similarity may be circumstantial, and we consider
it a weak link.
C:\Users\User\Desktop\sourc\Chrome-Password-Recovery-master\Chrome-PasswordRecovery-master\obj\Debug\ChromeRecovery.pdb

10/18

SUGARDUMP using SMTP for C2 communication – dated to late 2021-early 2022. This
variant was downloaded from a known UNC3890 C2 (URL: hxxp://128.199.6[.]246/3-VideoVLC.exe), and is a slightly more advanced version with similar credential harvesting
functionality.
The downloaded file “3-Video-VLC.exe” (MD5: ae0a16b6feddd53d1d52ff50d85a42d5) is a
Windows installer which, upon execution, drops and executes two files under the path
%AppData%\\Roaming\\:
1. CrashReporter.exe (MD5: 084ad50044d6650f9ed314e99351a608) – a browser
credential harvesting tool (SUGARDUMP).
2. RealDo1080.mp4 (MD5: d8fb3b6f5681cf5eec2b89be9b632b05) – a social engineering
video, played using Windows Media Player while CrashReporter.exe is executed. The
video contains a commercial for AI-driven robotic dolls.
Upon first execution, CrashReporter.exe (SUGARDUMP) attempts to locate the folder:
%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\CrashPad\\
If it wasn’t found it will search for folder: %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Internet
Explorer\\TabRoaming\\
If the latter folder is not found as well, the malware proceeds to create it. The malware will
then copy itself into “TabRoaming” folder again under the name “CrashReporter.exe”.
Subsequently, a scheduled task is created, which ensures the persistence of this version of
SUGARDUMP:
In Windows 7 the scheduled task is called:
"MicrosoftInternetExplorerCrashRepoeterTaskMachineUA", and contains the
description "Keep your Microsoft software without any bugs. If this task is disabled or
stopped, your Microsoft software may not work properly, meaning bugs that may arise
cannot be fixed and features may not work.”
In other Windows OS versions the scheduled task is called:
"MicrosoftEdgeCrashRepoeterTaskMachineUA", and contains the description “Keep
your Microsoft software without any bugs. If this task is disabled or stopped, your Edge
browser may not work properly, meaning bugs that may arise cannot be fixed and
features may not work.”
The scheduled task is configured to execute CrashReporter.exe during user logon.
The malware then attempts to connect to “smtp.yandex.com” and “smtp.mail.yahoo.com” via
port 587. If the attempt is successful, the malware starts to harvest bowser related
information on the host.
This version of SUGARDUMP harvest credentials from the following browsers:

11/18

Firefox (added functionality with relation to the previous version)
Chrome
Opera
Edge
For each browser the malware attempts to extract login credentials from the following paths:
%Appdata%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles
%Appdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data
%Appdata%\\Opera Software\\Opera Stable
%Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data
This version of SUGARDUMP also extracts the browser’s version, browsing history,
bookmarks, and cookies.
The extracted data structure looks as follows:

Figure 6: Exfiltrated data format of SUGARDUMP
The collected data is subsequently encoded using base64 and stored under: %
<malware_execution_folder>%\\CrashLog.txt
The malware will then send the file “CrashLog.txt” via email, by connecting and sending it
from one of the two following email addresses:
12/18

john.macperson2021@yandex[.]com
john.macperson2021@yahoo[.]com
The email is sent to one of these four email addresses:
john.macperson2021@yandex[.]com
john.macperson2021@yahoo[.]com
john.macperson2021@gmail[.]com
john.macperson@protonmail[.]com
The subject for each message would be “VLC Player”, with “CrashLog.txt” attached.
If SUGARDUMP fails to send the message, it creates a new file under: %
<malware_current_execution_path>%\\CrashLogName.txt, and writes to the file the error
details. "CrashLogName.txt" is also sent via email, using the same method mentioned
above. Afterwards, the malware terminates its execution.
SUGARDUMP using HTTP for C2 communication – dated to April 2022, this version
sends the stolen credentials to an UNC3890 C2 server (144.202.123[.]248:80). We observed
this version dropped by a .xls file which contains a fake job offer to a software developer
position in NexisLexis, a data analytics platform (MD5:
639f83fa4265ddbb43e85b763fe3dbac).
The .xls file contains a Macro, which upon enablement attempts to execute an embedded PE
file using RunDLL (MD5: e125ed072fc4529687d98cf4c62e283e). The PE file is the newest
version of SUGARDUMP we observed so far.
Like previous versions, this version of SUGARDUMP harvests credentials from Chromiumbased browsers Chrome, Opera and Edge. The data is saved in a new file under
%TEMP%\\DebugLogWindowsDefender.txt.
The collected data is subsequently encrypted using AES encryption using Cipher Block
Chaining (CBC) mode. The encryption key is the Sha256 of an embedded password:
“1qazXSW@3edc123456be name KHODA 110 !!)1qazXSW@3edc”. The word “KHODA”
means god in Farsi.
After the encryption process, the data is also encoded using Base64, and subsequently sent
over HTTP to an UNC3890 C2 server: 144.202.123[.]248:80.
The .NET project for this version of SUGARDUMP was named "yaal", which is the Farsi word
for a horse’s mane. This, along with the use of the word “KHODA” in SUGARDUMP’s
encryption key, may strengthen the possibility that the developers of SUGARDUMP are Farsi
speakers.
