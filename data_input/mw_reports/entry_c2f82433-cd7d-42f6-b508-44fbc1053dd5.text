WARNING
Pursuant to Section 12(1) of Act No 181/2014, on cyber security, the National Cyber and Information
Security Agency, registered office Mučednická 1125/31, 616 00 Brno (hereinafter referred to as “the
Agency”) is issuing this
warning
against a cybersecurity threat in the form of an extensive campaign of cyberattacks on information
and communication systems in the Czech Republic, and on the systems of healthcare facilities in
particular. This campaign could have severe impacts on the availability, confidentiality, and integrity
of the information in important information and communication systems.
The Agency has information that the threat could be carried out in the coming days, however there
are also indications that the preparatory phase of the attacks is already in progress, namely via a
spear-phishing campaign.
The National Cyber and Information Security Agency assesses this threat level as High – the threat is
probable to highly probable.
In the light of this threat, the Agency strongly recommends taking the following actions:
-

Draw users’ attention to the dangers of spear-phishing and include a request for any users
who have opened suspicious attachments in the last few days to contact the infrastructure
administrator;

-

Draw users’ attention to the possibility that phishing might contain “masked” executable
files, such as “obrazek.png.exe”, “text.txt.exe”, “dokument.pdf.exe” etc.;

-

If possible, use a central setting to prevent the launching of active content and macros,
especially in .doc and .docx documents;

-

Immediately block remote access to the infrastructure as well as open services to the public
network, with the exception of strictly necessary ones (public IP ranges can be checked

in the available search engines of devices connected to the network, and thus ports that
were opened or forgotten in the past, or services available from the public network, can be
secured);
-

Immediately create offline backup files and perform such backups based on the importance
of the data for the organisation;

-

Check the consistency of already created backup files and immediately update antivirus
solutions in the infrastructure.

The Agency further provides the following hashes of harmful files for potential checking for
harmful activities:

JUSTIFICATION
1. Based on facts established during the course of its activities, and obtained from bodies
involved in cybersecurity abroad and domestic partners, the Agency has identified a
cybersecurity threat associated with an ongoing campaign of major cyberattacks on
information and communication systems in the Czech Republic aiming at multiple targets in
the Czech Republic, and at healthcare facilities in particular.
2. As part of its activities pursuant to Section 22(u) of the Act on Cyber Security, the Agency
monitors and analyses cybersecurity threats and risks, and pursuant to Section 20(b)(f)
receives reports of cybersecurity incidents from entities obliged under the Act on Cyber
Security, from other entities not obliged under the Act on Cyber Security, and from other
partners. During these activities, the Agency has acquired indications that the preparatory
phase of the attack is already in progress, namely in the form of a spear-phishing campaign.
3. The Agency has noticed an increased number of cyberattacks with particularly dangerous
impacts in the context of the current situation associated with the occurrence of coronavirus
(SARS CoV-2) in the Czech Republic, the state of emergency, and the need to ensure the
functioning of important information and communication systems and the services they
support.
4. Taken as a whole, these facts have led to well-founded concern that serious cyberattacks
aimed at important targets in the Czech Republic might be carried out. Hence the Agency is
issuing this warning in compliance with Section 12(1) of the Act on Cyber Security.
5. The Agency has the right to issue this warning under Section 22(b) of the Act on Cyber
Security, which entitles it to issue measures. In line with Section 11(2) of the Act on Cyber
Security, these measures also include warnings pursuant to Section 12 of the Act on Cyber
Security. A warning is to be issued by the Agency pursuant to Section 12(1) of the Act on
Cyber Security if it becomes aware of a cybersecurity threat through its activities or based on
the instigation of the National CERT or bodies active in cybersecurity abroad. In compliance
with Section 12(2) of the Act on Cyber Security, the Agency issues such warning on its
website and notifies the bodies and entities mentioned in Section 3 of the Act on Cyber
Security.
6. According to Section 22(j) of the Act on Cyber Security, the Agency is obliged to ensure
prevention in the area of cybersecurity. These preventive actions also include the provision
of information about identified cybersecurity threats. If a threat reaches such intensity that
the Agency cannot provide sufficient information through its standard preventive activities,
the Agency is obliged to issue a warning in line with the above and pursuant to Section 12 of
the Act on Cyber Security.
7. The Agency notes that the bodies or entities obliged to adopt safety measures pursuant to
the Act on Cyber Security are obliged to factor this warning into their risk management.
Based on the above, the Agency considers the threat associated with the cyber attacks

mentioned in the statement of this warning to be probable to highly probable. The bodies
and entities obliged to adopt safety measures pursuant to the Act on Cyber Security are
therefore obliged to assess this threat at the respective level, i.e. at the level High.
