Meet CrowdStrike’s Adversary of the Month for June: MUSTANG
PANDA
June 15, 2018
Adam Meyers Research & Threat Intel

The June 2018 adversary spotlight is on MUSTANG PANDA, a China-based
adversary that has demonstrated an ability to rapidly assimilate new tools
and tactics into its operations, as evidenced by its use of exploit code for CVE-20170199 within days of its public disclosure.
In April 2017, CrowdStrike® Falcon Intelligence™ observed a previously unattributed
actor group with a Chinese nexus targeting a U.S.-based think tank. Further analysis
revealed a wider campaign with unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This
adversary targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in general, but
uses Mongolian language decoys and themes, suggesting this actor has a specific focus on
gathering intelligence on Mongolia. These campaigns involve the use of shared
malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX.
Recently, Falcon Intelligence observed new activity from MUSTANG PANDA, using a
unique infection chain to target likely Mongolia-based victims. This newly
observed activity uses a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of

legitimate tools to gain access to the targeted systems. Additionally, MUSTANG PANDA
actors reused previously-observed legitimate domains to host files.

Mustang Panda’s Methods
Mustang Panda’s unique infection chain often takes the following steps:
1. The infection chain used in this attack begins with a weaponized link to
a Google Drive folder, obfuscated using the goo.gl link shortening service.
2. When contacted, the Google Drive link retrieves a zip file, which
contains a .lnk file obfuscated as a .pdf file using the double extension trick.
3. This file requires the target to attempt to open the .lnk file, which
redirects the user to a Windows Scripting Component (.wsc) file, hosted
on an adversary-controlled microblogging page. MUSTANG PANDA has previously
used the observed microblogging site to host malicious PowerShell scripts and
Microsoft Office documents in targeted attacks on Mongolia-focused NGOs.
4. The .lnk file uses an embedded VBScript component to retrieve a decoy
PDF file and a PowerShell script from the adversary-controlled web page.
5. The PowerShell script creates a Cobalt Strike stager payload. This
PowerShell script also retrieves an XOR-encoded Cobalt Strike beacon payload from
an adversary-controlled domain.
6. The Cobalt Strike Beacon implant beacons to the command-and-control
(C2) IP address, which is used to remotely control the implant.
There are no known community or industry names associated with this actor.
