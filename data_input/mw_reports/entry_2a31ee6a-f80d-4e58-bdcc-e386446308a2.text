Executive Summary
On Dec. 13, the cyber community became aware of one of the most significant cybersecurity
events of our time, impacting both commercial and government organizations around the
world. The event was a supply chain attack on SolarWinds OrionⓇ software conducted by
suspected nation-state operators that we are tracking as SolarStorm. Unit 42 was able to
connect this event back to an attack we successfully prevented earlier this year. On Dec. 18,
we launched a SolarStorm Rapid Assessment program resulting in more than 600 companies
requesting this service within the first four days.
While this is not the first software supply chain compromise, it may be the most notable, as
the attacker was trying to gain widespread, persistent access to a number of critical networks.
Given the importance of the event, we are publishing a timeline of the attack based on our
extensive research into the information available to us and our direct experience defending
against this threat. We believe this will be invaluable to cybersecurity professionals in the
industry responding to this attack, as well as to other researchers piecing together the event
details. And as we learn that this threat actor used additional attack vectors, we urge
everyone to share what they know about this attack so that we as a cybersecurity community
get a complete picture of it as quickly as possible.

1/12

It is important to note that we do not have complete knowledge of when the planning and
execution of this campaign began. We do, however, have evidence that SolarStorm command
and control (C2) infrastructure was set up as early as August 2019. The first modified
SolarWinds software was released in October 2019, and the earliest related Cobalt Strike
payload we’ve identified was generated using Cobalt Strike 4.0, which was built in December
2019. We do not know when SolarStorm first compromised the SolarWinds software supply
chain or the method by which they accomplished this task.
Additionally, multiple reports indicate that SolarStorm employed additional initial access
vectors beyond the compromised SolarWinds software. We are tracking these reports but
have not confirmed other techniques used to obtain initial access to networks at this time. Of
course, we should expect that an adversary with the capability to execute this campaign could
have used many additional means to accomplish their goal.
Those seeking details on how Palo Alto Networks is protecting its customers from this threat,
please read our Threat Brief on SolarStorm and SUNBURST containing those details, which
is being updated as new information comes to light. The SolarStorm ATOM is also being
updated as new details emerge.

SolarStorm Timeline Summary
Researchers reported a supply chain attack affecting organizations around the world on Dec.
13, 2020. This incident involved malicious code identified within the legitimate IT
performance and statistics monitoring software, OrionⓇ, developed by SolarWinds.
Since then, details from other security vendors and organizations have been released, further
building on the events leading up to the initial disclosure. Unit 42 has conducted research
based on what is publicly available and what information has been identified within internal
2/12

data.
The timeline in Figure 1 displays a high-level summary of the events observed, beginning as
early as August 2019 and continuing through December 2020.

Figure 1. SolarStorm Visual Timeline

Analysis of the SolarWinds software revealed code modification as early as October 2019,
although the first weaponized software updates, denoted as SUNBURST malware, were not
released until approximately March 2020. Unit 42 has also observed two samples of the
modified SolarWinds software which appear as early as October 2019.
The majority of the infrastructure observed in this campaign was acquired between
December 2019 and March 2020; however, at least one domain, incomeupdate[.]com, noted
in Cobalt Strike BEACON activity, was registered in August 2019 as depicted in Table 1.
SolarStorm operators acquired SSL certificates for many of the associated domains between
February and April 2020, with at least one certificate extending to July.
The extensive infrastructure build-out throughout this timeline helps to visualize the
persistence of the operation from initial targeting to completion of the objective. SolarStorm
threat actors are highly skilled and thorough in their operational handling.
To better understand the timing around when organizations installed the malicious
SUNBURST update, we reviewed our DNS Security logs for requests to avsvmcloud[.]com,
the domain used with a domain generation algorithm (DGA) in this activity. Industry
partners ultimately seized this domain in December 2020.

3/12

Our search returned responses from April-November 2020. The counts of requests observed
in DNS Security logs each month are shown in Figure 2 below.

Figure 2: Number of requests for avsvmcloud[.]com (and subdomains) per month.

The requests begin in April, shortly after SolarStorm distributed the malicious update. They
then slowly rise with a peak in July and begin to trail off. This pattern could be explained by
organizations slowly installing the malicious updates in the weeks after release, but we can’t
say for sure. Microsoft and industry partners seized control of this domain on Dec. 15. They
used it to send a form of “killswitch” command, instructing SUNBURST to terminate itself
and prevent further execution.

Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR Blocked an Attempted SolarStorm
Attack
As our CEO Nikesh Arora described on Dec. 17, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR successfully
prevented a SolarStorm attack by immediately detecting and preventing an attempt to
execute Cobalt Strike Beacon on one of our IT SolarWinds servers last year. To help provide
more insight into the timeline around this threat, we are sharing more details about what our
security operations center (SOC) observed at that time.
There are three initial phases to an intrusion from SolarStorm:
1. A SolarWinds Orion server updates its software and downloads the malicious update
containing the SUNBURST backdoor.

4/12

2. SUNBURST then sends DNS requests to check in with the attacker, which contain
information identifying the organization. The attacker chooses to designate some
organizations as being of interest for further intrusion.
3. For SUNBURST to gain further access into the network, additional steps are needed
starting with downloading and executing an additional malicious payload.
The Palo Alto Networks SOC observed a DNS request from our Solarwinds Orion server for
the avsvmcloud[.]com domain on Sept. 29, 2020. During this short-lived connection, no
malicious content was downloaded but the system was likely labeled for further intrusion.
Six days later, on Oct. 5, 2020, a second connection occurred in which a new payload was
downloaded. With the use of Cortex XDR’s Behavioral Threat Protection capability, this
payload was instantly detected and the attempt to execute was prevented. Our SOC then
immediately isolated the server, initiated an investigation and verified our infrastructure was
secure. Additionally, at this time, our SOC notified SolarWinds of the activity observed. The
investigation by our SOC concluded that the attempted attack was unsuccessful and no data
was compromised.
We thought this was an isolated incident. However, on Dec. 13, when SolarWinds disclosed
SUNBURST, it became clear that the incident we prevented was an attempted SolarStorm
attack. Given this new information, our SOC exercised due diligence and analyzed our entire
infrastructure extensively again to revalidate the security of our entire network. We remain
confident that our network continues to be secure.

Observed TEARDROP Activity
Unit 42 has and continues to research this campaign to identify additional details that could
lead to further defensive actions.
During analysis of the information available, Unit 42 identified related activity involving
TEARDROP malware that was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON. This
sample contains a beacon request to the previously unreported domain mobilnweb[.]com.
The TEARDROP DLL has a SHA256 of:
118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51
and contains a beacon request for the URI /2019/Person-With-Parnters-Brands-Our/ with
the User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36. Within that same configuration, we also
observed an additional URI setting containing the string /2019/This-Person-Two-JoinWith/.
The following watermark setting was also present and appears to be unique to this sample
0x38383430 (943207472). This watermark likely indicates that the operators used a licensed
version of Cobalt Strike.
5/12

Additional configuration details of interest include:
SETTING_C2_POSTREQ:
Referer: https://yahoo[.]com/
Host: mobilnweb[.]com
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US
Connection: close
name="uploaded_1";filename="91018.png"
Content-Type: text/plain
SETTING_SPAWNTO_X86:
%windir%\syswow64\msinfo32.exe
SETTING_SPAWNTO_X64:
%windir%\sysnative\control.exe
Although the configuration details above show the referer as https://yahoo[.]com, we do not
have evidence that Yahoo was used in an actual beacon.

SolarStorm Infrastructure Establishment Timeline
While some of these domains have a registration date earlier than the dates depicted here,
the dates shown are the domain modification dates believed to be when the actors acquired
control over the domain. The variation in registration date vs. the time of acquisition by
SolarStorm provides an added sense of legitimacy for the domains in use.

Table 2. SSL certificates associated with SolarStorm domain activity

Additional Tools and Techniques
There have been many reports indicating that SolarStorm used additional techniques and
tools with this incident. A summary of our current knowledge of this use is as follows:
VMware
According to recent reporting, VMware has been associated with this attack in two ways.
First, the National Security Agency released an advisory earlier this month about CVE-20204006, a command injection vulnerability, stating that Russian state-sponsored actors were
actively exploiting the vulnerability and suggesting US Government agencies patch
8/12

immediately. This vulnerability exists in five VMware software products focused on identity
and access management. Exploitation allows attackers to deploy a webshell on the system
and gain access to protected data. This vulnerability can only be exploited by someone who
has already authenticated to the system and indicates that when leveraged, it likely is used to
gain additional access once the attacker is already inside the networks. More information
about CVE-2020-4006 can be found in our previously released Threat Brief: VMware
Command Injection Vulnerability.
Second, VMware stated they have SolarWinds OrionⓇ systems in their environment, but they
have not seen any evidence of exploitation. Unit 42 has not seen any indication that
VMware’s software was used as an infection vector or a TTP utilized within the SolarStorm
attack.
Microsoft / SAML
Microsoft has published multiple reports on activity related to this attack campaign,
including a summary of the backdoor implanted into SolarWinds OrionⓇ (referred to by
Microsoft as Solorigate), as well as guidance for their customers on protecting themselves.
They have publicly stated they are working with more than 40 companies who have been
targeted in this attack.
One specific component of the attack that Microsoft has discussed in detail is what they have
observed in compromised networks with regard to identity infrastructure. Specifically, the
attackers have exfiltrated SAML token signing certificates that allow them to forge tokens
and access any resources trusted by those certificates. Microsoft has observed these forged
tokens presented to the Microsoft cloud on behalf of their customers.
The impact of a compromise of these certificates implies the attacker gained the highest level
of privileges inside the network and used them to establish long-term access to the network.
SUPERNOVA Webshell
FireEye’s initial report on the SolarWinds compromise included indicators for a webshell
they call SUPERNOVA. Since publication, FireEye has removed those indicators as they no
longer believe they were used as a result of the SolarWinds software compromise. This
webshell may not be related, but it is still vital to defend against it. Unit 42 has already
published an analysis of the SUPERNOVA webshell.
MFA Bypass
The SAML token-forging attack described above would allow an attacker to evade multifactor authentication systems, as in that case, the authentication system itself is
compromised. Volexity published a report about a threat group named Dark Halo who they
have now connected to SolarStorm. Their report describes that the attacker targeted the

9/12

“integration secret key” used to connect Cisco’s Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
solution to an Outlook Web Access server. With that key, they were able to pre-compute the
token codes necessary for authentication.
Once again, similar to the SAML token-forging attack, this MFA bypass requires a significant
compromise of the systems used to authenticate users and would have been performed postcompromise to extend the attacker’s access to the network.
Other Initial Access Vectors
On Dec. 19, CISA updated their alert on this threat to include this note:
“CISA has evidence that there are initial access vectors other than the SolarWinds Orion
platform. Specifically, we are investigating incidents in which activity indicating abuse of
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens consistent with this adversary’s
behavior is present, yet where impacted SolarWinds instances have not been identified.
CISA is working to confirm initial access vectors and identify any changes to the TTPs.
CISA will update this Alert as new information becomes available.”
Unit 42 does not yet know what additional initial access vectors may have been used in this
attack. Detecting the forged SAML tokens is a clear indication of a compromise, so it makes
sense that if that appears in an environment with no SolarWinds OrionⓇ servers, another
route must have existed. We should expect that an adversary with the capability to execute
this campaign could have used many additional means to accomplish their goal.

Software Supply Chain Attacks
SolarWinds is not the first developer to have their software supply chain mishandled. At the
end of 2017, we published an article titled “The Era of Software Supply Chain Attacks Has
Begun,” which laid out previous software supply chain attacks and predicted an increased
focus on attacking trusted developers. Below is a summary of these significant events.
September 2015 – XcodeGhost: An attacker distributed a version of Apple’s Xcode
software (used to build iOS and macOS applications), which injected additional code
into iOS apps built using it. This attack resulted in thousands of compromised apps
identified in Apple’s app store.
March 2016 – KeRanger: Popular open source BitTorrent client, Transmission, was
compromised to include macOS ransomware in its installer. Attackers compromised
the legitimate servers used to distribute Transmission, so users who downloaded and
installed the program would be infected with malware that held their files for ransom.

10/12

June 2017 – NotPetya: Attackers compromised a Ukrainian software company and
distributed a destructive payload with network-worm capabilities through an update to
the “MeDoc” financial software. After infecting systems using the software, the malware
spread to other hosts in the network and caused a worldwide disruption affecting many
organizations.
September 2017 – CCleaner: Attackers compromised Avast’s CCleaner tool, used by
millions to help keep their PC working properly. The compromise was used to target
large technology and telecommunications companies worldwide with a second-stage
payload.
In September 2019, attackers again likely targeted Avast’s CCleaner tool after gaining access
to Avast’s network through a temporary VPN profile. It is not clear whether or not the same
operators from 2017 were involved in this incident.
In each case, including the recent SolarStorm activities, rather than targeting an organization
directly through phishing or exploitation of vulnerabilities, the attackers chose to
compromise software developers directly and use the trust we place in them to access other
networks. This can effectively evade certain prevention and detection controls that have been
tuned to trust well-known programs.
This pattern of software supply chain compromises will continue, and security teams can not
afford to ignore them. Protecting against these attacks is not simple for any enterprise, and
those who are responsible for writing and deploying software need to take responsibility for
the integrity of that code.

Conclusion
Since the events of the SolarWinds supply chain attack have unfolded, Unit 42 has actively
worked to gather full event details using both publicly available information and internal
analysis of an attack against our own network that matches event details reported by FireEye.
While we do not have complete knowledge of the full planning and execution of this
campaign, analysis thus far has concluded that the activities of SolarStorm began as early as
August 2019 during the infrastructure build-out phase of their operation. SolarStorm
operators displayed a tactical and persistent method of operation throughout the entire
attack cycle.
While SolarStorm is capable of utilizing many techniques to accomplish their goal, details on
initial access vectors beyond the compromised SolarStorm software have not yet been
confirmed.

new information comes to light.
