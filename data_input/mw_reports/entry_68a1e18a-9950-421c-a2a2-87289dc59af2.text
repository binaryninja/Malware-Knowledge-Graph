Darwinism is partly based on the ability for change that increases an individual’s ability to
compete and survive. Malware authors are not much different and need to adapt to survive
in changing technological landscapes and marketplaces. In a previous blog, we highlighted
a free Android remote administration tool (RAT) known as AndroRAT (Android.Dandro)
and what was believed to be the first ever malware APK binder. Since then, we have seen
imitations and evolutions of such threats in the threat landscape. One such threat that is
making waves in underground forums is called Dendroid (Android.Dendoroid), which is
also a word meaning something is tree-like or has a branching structure.

Dendroid is a HTTP RAT that is marketed as being transparent to the user and firmware
interface, having a sophisticated PHP panel, and an application APK binder package. The
APK binder used by Dendroid just so happens to share some links to the author of the
original AndroRAT APK binder.

According to postings on underground forums, the official seller of Dendroid is known as
“Soccer.” The seller markets Dendroid as offering many features that have never been
seen before and comes with 24/7 support, all for a once off payment of $300 to be paid
through BTC, LTC, BTC-e, or other services. Some of the many features on offer include
the following:
Delete call logs
Call a phone number
Open Web pages
Record calls and audio
Intercept text messages
Take and upload photos and videos
Open an application
Initiate a HTTP flood (DoS) for a period of time
Change the command-and-control (C&C) server

As previously mentioned, according to reports on underground forums, the author of the
Dendroid APK binder included with this package had assistance writing this APK binder
from the author of the original AndroRAT APK binder.
The evolution of remote access tools on the Android platform was inevitable. The creation
of Dendroid and the positive feedback on underground forums for this type of threat shows
that there is a strong cybercriminal marketplace for such tools. On the PC platform, other
crimeware toolkits like Zeus (Trojan.Zbot) and SpyEye (Trojan.Spyeye) started off in a
similar manner and grew quickly in popularity due to their ease of use and notoriety
stemming from the high profile crimes perpetrated as a result of their usage. While this
may be early days for Dendroid, Symantec will be keeping a close eye on this threat.
To stay protected, Symantec recommends installing a security app, such as Norton Mobile
Security, which detects this threat as Android.Dendoroid. For general safety tips for
