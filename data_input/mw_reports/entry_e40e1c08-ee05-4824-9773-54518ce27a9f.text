3 March 2021 / Botnet

Background
Fbot, a botnet based on Mirai, has been very active ever sine we first blogged about it
here[1][2], we have seen this botnet using multiple 0 days before(some of them we have not
disclosed yet) and it has been targeting various IoT devices, now, it is aiming a new
category, traffic and transportation smart devices.
On February 20, 2021, the 360Netlab Threat Detection System captured attackers were
using a remote command execution vulnerability (CVE-2020-9020)[3][4] in the Vantage
Velocity product from Iteris to spread Fbot botnet samples.
According to Wikipedia[5], Iteris, Inc. provides intelligent mobile infrastructure management
services and produces sensors and other devices that record and predict traffic conditions.
Based on the AIrLink GX450 Mobile Gateway production information found on the affected
devices, we speculate that the affected devices are roadside monitoring device.

CVE-2020-9020 Vulnerability Analysis
Through the 360 FirmwareTotal system, we verified and analyzed the CVE-2020-9020
vulnerability, here is the brief.
1. Vantage Velocity product synchronizes With NTP Server, where user can set the
specified ntp server address.
2. The timeconfig.py script does not filter the htmlNtpServer variable after
accepting a user Web request, i.e., it is spliced into the shell variable format
"ntpserver=" + form["htmlNtpServer"].value.strip() and written to the
/root/timeparam file.
3. The command execution vulnerability is triggered when the timeconfig.py script
calls the shell script /root/ntpconfig , which reads the /root/timeparam file to
initialize the variable ntpserver.

The 360 Quake cyberspace mapping system found the specific distribution of Vantage
Velocity devices by mapping assets across the network as shown in the figure below.

Fbot botnet
Fbot is a botnet based on Mirai, with 2 main changes
Encryption algorithm
Registration packets, heartbeat packets
The basic information of this sample is shown below:
MD5:deaee7ada44bf1c6af826d2d170c8698
ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
Packer:None
It has no added features in itself, the main function is
DDoS attack
Telnet scanning
The following section will briefly analyze around the above functions.

DDoS attack
First Fbot establishes a connection with the hardcoded C2 (198.23.238.203:5684) via the
following code snippet.

2/8

Then it sends a 78-byte long registration message to C2

The network traffic generated in practice is shown below.

The information in the registration packet is used to verify the legal identity of the BOT, and
the format of the registration packet is parsed as shown below.
Main field parsing，others can be 0

--->length of group string

After sending the registration packet the Bot starts to wait for C2 to issue commands, the first
byte of the command packet specifies the command type.

Take the following heartbeat as an example

The format of the heartbeat packet is parsed as follows

Telnet scan & propagation
Fbot uses the technique of SYN port detection in the propagation process to improve the
efficiency of propagation.

From the above code snippet, it can be seen that its scanning traffic has 2 characteristics
1. The number of scanned 23 ports is about twice as many as 26 ports
2. The sequence number in the tcp header is equal to the target address in the ip header
When a port is detected as open, login is attempted using a hard-coded credential list. Once
successful, the IP, port, account, password, etc. are sent back to Reporter
(198.23.238.203:774) via the following code snippet.

The actual network traffic generated is shown in the following figure.

Finally, the Fbot sample is implanted to the device either with network download(see below)
or ECHO, and the successful implantation information is sent back to Reporter.
1：Network download

5/8

If the device has wget or tftp, the Fbot sample of the corresponding CPU architecture on the
device will be downloaded.

2：ECHO
If the device does not have a network download tool, the Fbot downloader of the
corresponding CPU architecture is uploaded to the device via ECHO to download the Fbot
samples.

The information of the Fbot downloader built into the sample is shown as follows.

In the above figure, the downloader with file offset 0x1D794 is used as an example.

6/8

MD5:9b49507d1876c3a550f7b7a6e4ec696d
ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (ARM), statically linked, stripped
Packer:None
Its function is to request the Fbot sample from the download server (198.23.238.203:80) and
execute it.

Suggestions
We recommend Vantage Velocity users to check and update the firmware system in a timely
manner.
We recommend that Vantage Velocity users set complex login passwords for management
interfaces such as Web and SSH.
We recommend that readers monitor and block relevant IPs and URLs mentioned in this
blog.
