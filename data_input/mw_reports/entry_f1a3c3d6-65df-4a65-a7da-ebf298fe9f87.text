The other infection chain involves an attached .XLS file containing an Excel formula that utilizes a PowerShell command
(Figure 2) to access paste.ee, a Pastebin alternative, that accesses a second encrypted PowerShell command (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Encoded and decoded PowerShell script from a paste.ee URL
Decoding these PowerShell scripts revealed that they are used to access paste.ee URLs for easy implementation of fileless
payloads. The CallByName export function in Visual Basic is used to call the load of a .NET assembly within memory from a
paste.ee URL. The loaded assembly, obfuscated with an Agile.NET obfuscator, hollows a legitimate MSBuild.exe process
and replaces it with its payload: the hex-encoded Panda Stealer binary from another paste.ee URL.
Once installed, Panda Stealer can collect details like private keys and records of past transactions from its victim’s various
digital currency wallets, including Dash, Bytecoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Not only does it target cryptocurrency wallets, it
can steal credentials from other applications such as NordVPN, Telegram, Discord, and Steam. It’s also capable of taking
screenshots of the infected computer and exfiltrating data from browsers like cookies, passwords, and cards.
It drops files under %Temp% folder that stores stolen information under randomized file names, which are then sent to a
command-and-control (C&C) server. Further analysis of its C&C server leads to a login page for "熊猫Stealer," which
translates to “Panda Stealer” (Figure 4), but more domains have been identified with the same login page (Figure 5).
Another 14 victims were discovered from the logs of one of these servers.

Another 264 files similar to Panda Stealer were found on VirusTotal. More than 140 C&C servers (Table 1) and over 10
download sites were used by these samples. Some of the download sites were from Discord, containing files with names
such as "build.exe," which indicates that threat actors may be using Discord to share the Panda Stealer build.
Some of the aforementioned download sites are listed below:

Table 1. The top C&C servers used by files that are similar to Panda Stealer
Attribution
Based on one of the active C&C servers (Figure 6), we have identified an IP address that we believe was used by the threat
actor. We believe that this address is assigned to a virtual private server (VPS) rented from Shock Hosting, which the actor
infected for testing purposes. The VPS may be paid for using cryptocurrency to avoid being traced and uses the online
service Cassandra Crypter (Figure 7). We have reported this to Shock Hosting, and they confirmed that the server assigned
to this IP address has been suspended.
Another infected machine was discovered with a history of visiting a Google Drive link, which is also mentioned in a
discussion about AZORult log extractor on an underground forum. The same link and unique cookie were observed on both
the log dumps and the forum, therefore the user who posted on the forum must also have access to that log file.

Similarities with other stealers

Panda Stealer was found to be a variant of Collector Stealer, which has been sold on some underground forums and a
Telegram channel (Figure 8). Collector Stealer has since been cracked by a Russian threat actor called NCP, also known as
su1c1de. Comparing the compiled executables of the cracked Collector Stealer and Panda Stealer shows that the two
behave similarly, but have different C&C URLs, build tags, and execution folders (Figure 9). Like Panda Stealer, Collector
Stealer exfiltrates information like cookies, login data, and web data from a compromised computer, storing them in an
SQLite3 database. It also covers its tracks by deleting its stolen files and activity logs after its execution (Figure 10).

Because the cracked Collector Stealer builder is openly accessible online, cybercriminal groups and script kiddies alike can
use it to create their own customized version of the stealer and C&C panel. Threat actors may also augment their malware
campaigns with specific features from Collector Stealer. We have also discovered that Panda Stealer has an infection chain
that uses the same fileless distribution method as the "Fair" variant of Phobos ransomware to carry out memory-based
attacks, making it more difficult for security tools to spot.
Protect your network from spammed threats
To protect systems against fileless threats that use spam emails as vectors, enterprises can use the Trend Micro endpoint
solutions such as Trend Micro Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security. Both solutions protect users
and businesses from threats by detecting malicious files and spammed messages and blocking all related malicious URLs.
Indicators of compromise
There were numerous files, domains, and IP addresses that were involved in this attack. Trend Micro has provided detection
for the malicious artifacts found in this investigation. A partial list of the notable items is detailed below:

Malware
In early April, we observed a new information stealer called Panda Stealer being delivered via spam emails. Based on Trend
Micro's telemetry, United States, Australia, Japan, and Germany were among the most affected countries during a recent
spam wave.
