By Jon Munshaw.
Nothing was normal in 2020. Our ideas of working from offices, in-person meetings, handson learning and basically everything else was thrown into disarray early in the year. Since
1/4

then, we defenders have had to adapt. But so have workers around the globe, and those IT
and security professionals in charge of keeping those workers’ information secure.
Adversaries saw all these changes as an opportunity to capitalize on strained health care
systems, schools scrambling to adapt to online learning and companies who now had
employees bringing home sensitive information and data while working on their personal
networks. This led to a huge spike in ransomware attacks and headlines all over of
companies spending millions of dollars to recover their data and get back to work quickly.
Oh, and there was a presidential election this year, too, which came with its own set of
challenges.
To recap this crazy year, we’ve compiled a list of the major malware, security news and more
that Talos covered this year. Look through the timeline below and click through some of our
other blog posts to get caught up on the year that was in malware.
January
Attackers used several popular and well-known file-hosting services to avoid
blocklisting and deliver a threat we called “JhoneRAT,” mainly to Arabic-speaking
targets.
February
Another RAT, “ObliqueRAT,” used malicious Microsoft Office documents to infect
diplomatic and government agencies/organizations in Southeast Asia. Cisco
Talos also discovered a link between ObliqueRAT and another campaign from
December 2019 distributing CrimsonRAT.
March
As the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, workers across the country and
globe had to begin working from home full-time. As the pandemic was the biggest
news story of the year, hitting its peak in mid-March, attackers started using news
around COVID-19 to spread malware.
The pandemic also presented a platform for adversaries to spread disinformation
around the virus and associated government relief packages.

April
Cisco Talos researchers highlighted some of the problems with using fingerprint
scans to protect your devices. We cloned fingerprints using a few different
methods and tested their ability to unlock certain devices, showing that you
shouldn’t use biometric scanners as the last line of defense for vital data or
devices.
Python-based PoetRAT used COVID-19-themed lures to target government
agencies and everyday users in Azerbaijan, also capitalizing on the country’s
ongoing military and civil conflicts.
Online meeting software exploded in popularity, which created a fresh target for
attackers looking to spread malware or just generally be disrupted. One such
example was this vulnerability in the Zoom meeting software Talos discovered,
though there are many more exploits out there for all sorts of meeting software.
The Aggah malspam campaign expanded its reach, now delivering Agent Tesla,
njRAT and Nanocore RAT.
May
Thai Android devices and users are targeted by a modified version of DenDroid
we called "WolfRAT," now targeting messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook
Messenger and Line.
Brazilian users are targeted with the Astaroth malware family, which used
YouTube as a unique command and control (C2) to help evade detection.
June
IndigoDrop utilizes military-themed malicious maldocs to spread Cobalt Strike
beacons containing full-fledged RAT capabilities. These maldocs use malicious
macros to deliver a multistage and highly modular infection.
The PROMETHIUM actor expands its reach and tries to infect new targets in
Colombia, India, Canada and Vietnam by teaming up with StrongPity3.
July
The wave of ransomware attacks hits a peak. Specifically, WastedLocker targeted
some big-name companies and organizations looking to make headlines and rake
in big paydays.
We released our first research paper in a series covering election security and
disinformation ahead of the November presidential election.
The Prometei botnet adds multiple ways to spread, deploying a Monero-focused
cryptocurrency miner.

September
A new campaign we dubbed “Salfram” spreads various malware payloads
including Gozi ISFB, ZLoader, SmokeLoader and AveMaria, among others.
With many students returning to school totally online, we spotted a spike in online
homework scams, with sites promising to write papers and complete assignments
for a fee, though many of them turned out to be phony or even deliver malware.
LodaRAT shows it’s adding new features and obfuscation techniques.
October
The Lemon Duck cryptocurrency-mining botnet uses several new techniques
likely to be spotted by defenders but would largely go undetected by end users
while the adversary stole their computing power.
The DoNot APT group experiments with new methods of delivery for their
payloads. They used a legitimate service within Google's infrastructure which
makes it harder for detection across a user's network.
The FBI and U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an
alert warning health care systems to look out for a wave of ransomware attacks,
corresponding in a rise in COVID-19 cases.
November
A new version of the CRAT malware pops up in the wild with sandbox evasion
techniques and a new modular plugin framework.
Emotet completes its 2020 comeback with a huge November and October,
increasing its activity across the globe after it largely went quiet over the summer.
December
We uncover the Xanthe cryptocurrency miner after it tried to compromise one of
Cisco's security honeypots for tracking Docker-related threats.
