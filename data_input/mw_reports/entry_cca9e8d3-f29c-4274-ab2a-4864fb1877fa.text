Introduction
This document is based on a specific part of the “Shadow Broker” leaks. The unknown party,
calling itself “Shadow Brokers” leaked information about stolen information from NSA a
number of times. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers on the details.
In the Fifth leak of the group, which was named "Lost in Translation", some very interesting
modules were included, some of them referred to as “Territorial Dispute”. A common
understanding is that the leak contains information stolen from U.S. agency NSA, hence we
will reflect the source as NSA, although we have no proofs on that, but we make no further
marks on the possible attribution problem on it.
The leak is not a single set of tools, as parts are replicated over at least two different toolsets
in the leaked material. However, the goal is clear. These tools are set to be used by operators
to scan attacked computers (hacked targets of NSA) to check if the target has already been
hacked by an outsider adversary (nation state backed targeted attack actor). In case of
external attack detected, the operator is called to make special attention (in some related
cases wording is “please pull back” or ask for supervisor’s advice.)
The size of the leak is huge, and there are tens of different tools and modules among them,
most of them to infect computers, retrieve data, and similar. But some tools are designed to
get a general knowledge about the infected computers, particularly about software, security
software and malware installed on it.
While there are some other parts in the leak where the attackers (the NSA) are looking for
signs of traditional cyber-crime software (malware) attacks, the Territorial Dispute part of the
leak seems the most interesting. We believe they have the same goal: avoid duel between
parties and minimalize the risk of detection of the attack of the governmental organization.
Our work, however, focuses on APT detection information - that can help to understand what
NSA knows about APT attacks from external governmental targeted attack operators.

1. Details
The tools, and scripts that the NSA used to detect other third parties (governmental actors)
on the target computers are very simple tools. They check for the existence of specific files,
windows registry entries, and other signs that could show the existence of external attacker
(targeted, state backed actors) presence on the actual computers. These checks are
considered in the term of the security community as IoC, Indicator of Compromise.
4

For an APT attack we can generally define IoCs in the number of tens or hundreds, but NSA
tools generally contained only very few IoCs, around 1-5, which is strange. Why do they trust
information from such closed set of indicators and not broaden it with multiple checks? In
general, if we find a piece of malware and want to hunt for similar ones, we try to define 5-10
or even more different specific features, signatures to detect similar attacks. Then it can be
set, that the search tool should only mark something important if 6 of 10 signs are found in
the sample. The same could stand for an infected computer: One single registry key or
existence of a single file named something common like “ipfilter.dll” might not be a good idea
to make a detection based on it. But still, as we mentioned, the detection IoCs are very limited
in number.
One trivial answer is that while they had probably more information, and ideas for detection,
they utilized the process in a way to give as little information as possible to the operators. The
operators of the leaked tools can check the source code and hence they can examine the IoCs
inside. So, operators have a chance to find clues about the attacks. But once an operator could
pinpoint that SIG8 is an attack against the nuclear program of Iran, who and how should
inform him to keep it secret? It is a good idea to avoid such findings by limitation of the
available information, and reduce IoCs in the tool to as few as possible. Still, it is a question
why Stuxnet was enlisted as external attack (if the SIGs refer only targeted attacks by external
parties), if possibly NSA also contributed to it? It is possible that Stuxnet attack was so hidden,
that only very few at NSA knew about that and they really mis-attributed their own attack
thinking belonging to external parties, hence it is part of the list, which list consists of attacks
from external parties.
The naming convention for the findings also reflect this fact. All these detections are referred
to as SIGX, where X stands for 1 to 45. Operators should not know about operation names,
they should handle the situation according to the plan.
As mentioned already, the “detection engine”, the IoC scanning tools are very simplistic, they
are looking for only a very few number of indicators, and it is not impossible, that they detect
some infections of external adversaries, but they cannot detect others. It is a very strange
decision, but maybe within the organization they already made a risk analysis and it showed
that there is a risk that external party could stole, use, or leak this information. The attackers
maybe though it was a good idea to limit the presence of IoCs in their tools to lower this risk.

IoC, scanner, public information
From the leak, we can extract the IoC information, the indicators of compromise, or in normal
wording the things they are looking for. But Territorial Dispute module looks for targeted APT
attacks, and there is a lot of public information uncovered about targeted attacks. The module
5

contains detection for the samples we really well know, as BME CrySyS Lab uncovered the
Duqu attack, worked on MiniDuke, TeamSpy, Duqu2 or others.
As there is a public set of information about APT attacks uncovered by security professionals
with a limited scope, and there must be a stack of information about the same attacks and
more at the intelligence community.
This leak can uncovers some of the gap between the knowledge of public (through
publications of the security community, mainly by the contribution of AV companies, and
research labs like us at BME CrySyS), and other organizations and can shed light on the amount
of difference of knowledge among these parties. Some 20 years before it was known how
many math experts were hired by NSA and by later it was understood that NSA is at least 10
years beyond current public crypto research results. However, how much NSA (and others)
are beyond gathering information on APT attacks was not uncovered yet. This leak helps us to
shed light on the timeline how NSA found traces to attackers and how public information was
available on the same attacks.
Please note, this leak was available to all kind of stakeholders on the internet for almost a
year, hence this publication will not add new information for most of the governmental
parties, and hence we believe it does not influence of any nation state’s security or safety.
However, common understanding of the situation at the public level is essential to avoid
confusion and to help public to make democratic decisions on procedures of the governmental
institutions. In contrast, one could expect, that based on the information in the leak,
previously unknown APT attacks could have been already uncovered, and it is not impossible
that even some still working 0-days could have been identified by professionals based on the
leak. Also, it is a question if that was a good idea not to distribute information about
discovered APTs by the government agency to help avoid further attacks.
Of course, sharing information about ongoing attacks could be debated. First of all, sharing
information might influence the attacker to change strategy and tools and hence agencies
cannot continue to closely observe their activity. Also, too many revealing could have speed
up other governments to build up capabilities to handle attacks similar to those that NSA is
capable to do. Finally, analysis of pros and cons of the sharing might have been resulted
positive for hiding information, as that should be a default decision for such entities.

Work method
The goal of our work is to boost interest on this topic and help other researchers to work on
the results. This means, we are unable to check those thousands of traces that the 45 IoCs of
the original leaks produces. We tried to make one step after the initial information and share
by this document to initiate research to widen results.
6

•

For some known APT attacks, the findings can extend knowledge, e.g. by adding new
known kernel driver names to Stuxnet attacks

•

For some, only very little information was available publicly yet, but based on the IoCs
malware samples, more could be uncovered and public knowledge about these could
be extended, although it is very unlikely that information about the victims will be
uncovered

•

For some attacks, additional IoCs can start up uncovering the attack, as before of that
traces were unavailable and hence APT research finished up in very short reports
stating “XY used this attack as targeted attack, from now on we refer to this under the
name of W” like reports.

•

On some IoCs, we never had public knowledge about the classification of a targeted
(APT) attack. Based on the current results, some attacks, samples, or even hundreds
of samples will get to be identified as part of some APT attacks that were previously
unknown or partially unknown.

Initially we tried to collect information from traditional open-source OPSEC sources, like
google search. We also tried to collect information by Yara rules applied to our malware
repository, which consists of at least 150 TB of known malicious binaries.
Of course, information from one source is a basis to find more information bases on the results
of the previous; hence we continued to track traces. However, the set of information is just
too wide so we definitely don’t clam the “extensive research” or “full research” tag, our part
of the story is to make “initial research”.
In the rest of the document, we mainly publish links, short information strips, and hashes. This
all means, we publish possibly next steps, reasoning on the origin of the attack, and all kind of
additional information that can help others to go forward. We don’t think we can or could
have made the best document based of the available facts, so we appreciate if anybody would
work on this and extend the common knowledge by their results.
Hence, we are happy to help others to publish their extensions on our work.
The current document plans to share information to professionals. Hence, in addition to the
public information (in multiple types), hashes of samples are included in the results. The
hashes might be partially usable, we do not have a clear vision if the samples found are really
connected to the attacks.

The tools
The tools related to “Territorial Dispute” and other APT related information can be found in
the following files and directories of the Shadow Brokers leak:
7

The windows\Resources\TeDi\PyScripts\ contains multiple files. Three of them are utility
scripts, while the most interesting python program is sigs.py, which contains very simple
‘signatures’ (named SIG1-SIG45), which link to known and unknown APT campaigns from the
recent years. The individual subroutines in this file are find_01 to find_45.

For example, find_08 relates to the Stuxnet attack, as demonstration, the subroutine is very
simple and short:

A piece of code resolves the abbreviation, ‘TeDi’ to Territorial Dispute:
tedilog = getLogger('TERRITORIALDISPUTE')
windows/Resources/TeDi/PyScripts/utils.py#9
In addition to the TeDi scanners, some other files also contain important information related
to targeted attacks.

8

Another directory windows\Resources\Ep\Scripts\malfind contains individual tools for
scanning for signs of APT attacks and extracting information:

9

For example, we identified that SIG25 is most likely the APT attack known as “Dark Hotel”. The
related scanning tool is a very simple script:

As we can see, this script looks for the existence of an actual file “winver32.exe” in the very
specific $docsandsettings\\$subkey\\Application Data\\winver32.exe path. Interestingly,
using google search to find connection between winver32.exe and Dark Hotel does not
currently show up any information about the connection, so this link might be a new finding
based on the leaked information.
The related “get” information gathering scripts are also interesting. For example, related to
Stuxnet (SIG8) the script contains the following file names:

10

If one of the files found on the target, the operator might decide to get a copy of the file. (Note
the “DropboxAPI” call, most likely this is the channel for the file transfer). Related code:

11

Another tool for scanning uses an external file with definitions to find related SIGs:
windows/Resources/Ep/Scripts/ifthen/gwdef_other_peeps.txt contains mostly the same
detection rules but in a different format. A sample screen on the tool:

The file DriverList.db (windows\Resources\Ops\Databases\DriverList.db), contains a list of
drivers related to APT attacks and also a list of Antivirus product drivers, hardware drivers and
some interesting ones, e.g.: information on U.S./NSA related attack tools with
remarks/commands for operators. A similar file in text format can also be found at
windows\Resources\Ops\Data\drv_list.txt
and
a
copy
of
it
at
windows\Resources\Ep\drv_list.txt.
The driver list most likely contains known windows kernel drivers, and remarks reveal the
connection with some APT attacks. For example, it seems that “biosfix” and “bitcheck” might
be related to SIG25 APT attack. From the indicators, we think SIG25 is the APT attack known
as “Dark Hotel”.

There are remarks for own tools:
"mscnsp","*** FORMALRITE/UNITEDRAKE ***"
12

"mscoreep","*** FOGGYBOTTOM/UNITEDRAKE ***"
and other interesting remarks:
"msfcvr32","*** DANGEROUS MALWARE - SEEK HELP ASAP ***"
"msrsfler","*** UNKNOWN - PLEASE PULL BACK ***"
"wmiapvrr", "*** FRIENDLY TOOL - SEEK HELP ASAP ***"
"bsdnfs", "*** SEEK HELP IMMEDIATELY ***"
More similar remarks can be found in the end of this document.

Related samples found in our malware repository
We made Yara rules based on the SIG detections and ran a scan across on our malware
database. The database contains around 150 TB malware samples. After finishing the scan
process some 290 000 malware samples were collected. Many of them are evidently false
positives, e.g. the string adobe.dll can be found in many thousands of samples.
The yara rules we used were based on the IoCs. However, as malware samples won’t contain
whole path, we had to transform the IoCs into some strings that have a chance to be found
in malicious binaries.
We tried to clean up those items that seemed to be very likely false positives. At the end we
have a collection of 5162 possibly related samples. The table below shows the number of
possible related hashes found by this method for each SIG.

Note, that this list contains not all known samples for each attack (e.g. for Stuxnet there are
hundreds of thousands known files), this only contains those, that contain the IoCs known
from the Shadow Brokers leak.
Many of these files might still false positive, but still, only a few files found for a previously
unknown APT campaign can be useful to start up detailed investigations and find additional
traces.
The full list of hashes with some basic tags is attached in a text file for easier use. The tags
are from matches to Yara rules available at https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base .
