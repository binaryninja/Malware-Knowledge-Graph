The Middle East

September 15, 2021

During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a Twitter post mentioning a
new variant of Android malware used by APT-C-23.
This Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group was first identified in 2017, where they targeted more than 100
devices from Palestine.
This variant calls itself Google_Play_Installer7080009821206716096 to trick users into thinking it’s an APK
related to Google Play.
Cyble Research Labs downloaded the sample and identified that APT-C-23, also known as “the two-tailed
scorpion,” targets the Middle East with this version of Android malware. This malware can steal sensitive
information like Contact data, SMS data, and files from the infected device.
The delivery mechanisms used by the Threat Actors (TAs) are through phishing or via a fake Android app
store; this application has an icon that is similar to the Telegram app.
Once the malware is successfully executed on the affected Android device, it can perform several malicious
activities without the user’s knowledge. These activities include taking pictures, recording audio, disabling
WiFi, stealing call logs, stealing SMSs, stealing Contact data, and steal files of a wide range of extensions
(PDF, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, txt, text, jpg, jpeg, png), etc.
The malware can also make calls without the user’s knowledge, delete files from the device, record the victim
device’s screen, take screenshots, read the text content, and record incoming and outgoing calls in
WhatsApp. Additionally, the malware checks for telecom operating out of the Middle East and specifically
targets them.
In 2020, APT-C-23 was also responsible for the attack on Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

Figure 1 Metadata Information
We have outlined the flow of the application and the various activities conducted by it. Refer to Figure 2.
The application has a similar icon as Telegram official app.
The application asks for Contacts, call logs, and SMS permissions.
The application asks users to grant admin rights.
The application asks the users to allow access to notifications.
The application asks permission to install 3rd party applications.
The application shows the Telegram app UI.

Figure 2 Application Start Flow
Upon simulating the application, we observed that it requests users for permissions to access Contacts, Call
logs, and SMS data. Refer to Figure 3.

Figure 3 Requests Sensitive Permissions

Figure 4 shows the malware asking users for device admin activation. Once the malware gains admin rights,
then it can enhance its features.

Figure 4 Requests for Admin Activation

Figure 5 shows that the malware asks the users to enable notification access for the application. Once the
application gains notification access, it can read all notifications on the device, including SMS data.

Figure 5 Asks for Notification Access

Upon receiving notification access, the application prompts users asking for permission to install 3rd party
applications. Once it gains this permission, the application will be able to install other applications or update
itself. Refer to Figure 6.

Figure 6 Asks for 3rd Party App Installation Permission

Figure 7 shows that after getting the required permissions, the malware opens a UI that is similar to the
official Telegram app.

Manifest Description
Voicemail requests thirty-five different permissions, of which the attackers can abuse eighteen. In this case,
the malware can:
Read, delete or modify SMSs, call logs, and Contact data.
Make calls without user interaction
Delete SMS data
Kill background processes of other apps
Receive and send SMSs
Reads current cellular network information, phone number and the serial number of the affected phone,
the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any phone accounts (for example: firmware accounts such
as Samsung account) registered on the device.
Read, delete or modify the files on the device’s external storage
Disable the keylock and any associated password security measures such as biometric verification.
We have listed the dangerous permissions below.

Conclusion
APT-C-23 TA groups use Android spyware to specifically target users in the Middle East.
These TAs are constantly adapting their methods to avoid detection and find new ways to target users
through sophisticated techniques. One of the most common methods used to infect devices is by disguising
the malware as a supposedly legitimate Google application to confuse users into installing them.
Users should only install applications after verifying their authenticity and install them exclusively from the
official Google Play Store to avoid such attacks.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Download and install software only from official app stores like the Google Play Store.
Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Users should be careful while enabling any permissions on their devices.
If you find any suspicious applications on your device, uninstall, or delete them immediately.
Use the shared IOCs to monitor and block the malware infection.
Keep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.
Keep your Android device, OS, and applications updated to the latest versions.
Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
