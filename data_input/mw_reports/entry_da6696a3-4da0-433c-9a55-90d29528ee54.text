By Team RiskIQ
RiskIQ's recent analysis of Magecart infrastructure has shown its massive scale and put its
interconnectivity into focus. Our most recent research takes two email addresses evoking the
name of one of the most prominent bulletproof hosting providers on earth and ties them to
newly discovered batches of Magecart infrastructure. From there, we show how this
infrastructure overlaps with previously reported Magecart activity and highlight some
common Magecart operator practices that can help researchers identify skimming
infrastructure.
Media Land is King
Meda Land LLC is a bulletproof hosting company that's become a powerhouse in the
cybercriminal underworld. The service is run by Ukrainian Alexander Alexandrovich
Volosovik (aka Yalishanda), who in July 2019, Brian Krebs named one of the most prolific
bulletproof hosters in the world.
Volosovik, who touts his company on cybercrime forums, advertises its ability to host all
manner of illicit sites and infrastructure. RiskIQ analysis shows that Media Land is also a
driving force in the Magecart ecosystem. Magecart groups use Media Land-registered
domains to carry out a massive amount of skimming and phishing attacks.

Media Land appears to be so ubiquitous that it rears its head in Magecart infrastructure even
when it's not directly hosting a skimming domain, possibly used to bolster credibility among
cybercriminals.
Our researchers have tied together significant swaths of Magecart infrastructure linked to the
name 'Julio Jaime.' The name was first publicly documented by a Sucuri report from August
of 2019, which noted Julio Jaime's use of 'Media Lend, LLC,' a name evoking the infamous
service provider as the registrant organization on some WHOIS records. RiskIQ connects
Media Lend, LLC to 180 malicious domains.
Julio Jaimes owns two email addresses that also include 'Media Land.' Together,
medialand.regru@gmail[.]com and medialand.webnic@gmail[.]com have been used to
register thousands of domains created for skimming and phishing. RiskIQ has tied the latter,
medialand.webnic@gmail.com, to at least 98 domains, including several Magecart skimming
domains.
The former, medialand.regru@gmail[.]com, appears to be unknown to the threat intelligence
community until now. We used our Internet Intelligence Graph to connect the Magecart
domains registered by these emails to several skimmers. Since December of 2018, RiskIQ
has observed this email address used to register over 1,000 domains intended or actively
used for skimming, phishing, and other malicious activities.
What's in a Name?
RiskIQ's Internet Intelligence Graph connects 'Julio Jaime' to more than 240 domains, most
of which they developed for phishing attacks targeting end-users of financial institutions,
such as the Bank of Ireland, and users of various services, such as Microsoft O365. These
also include domains RiskIQ has flagged for hosting Magecart card skimmers. You can see
two examples, cdnpack[.]net and gstaticapi[.]com in RiskIQ Community.
Julio Jaime also links to Magecart activity previously reported by RiskIQ. One of the domains
tied to the email address medialand.webnic@gmail.com includes jquerycloud[.]com. Our
December analysis of the Meyhod skimmer shows that our systems observed it on
jquerycloud[.]com.
The domain jquerycloud[.]com was hosted on the same IP address as another domain,
statexplore[.]com. On November 27, 2020, the WHOIS record for statexplore[.]com changed
to use the email address medialand.webnic@gmail.com with the name Mihael Smith (an
apparent misspelling of Michael) in lieu of 'Julio Jaime.' In our Inter Skimmer Kit post from
September 2020, we noted similar use of random names for registrations, which is common
among Magecart operators. However, in RiskIQ data, this misspelled name only associates
with the two ‘Media Land’ email address covered in this report.

In our November analysis on new variants of the Grelos skimmer, we highlighted the domain
facebookapimanager[.]com and connected it to several other Magecart domains with a
distinct cookie. Via the cookie, we connected facebookapimanager[.]com to another domain,
googleapimanager[.]com, which was registered by medialand.regru@gmail[.]com, the email
address belonging to the threat actor behind 'Julio Jaime' and 'Mihael Smith.’

Visualization of Magecart infrastructure connectivity

Googleapimanager[.]com was also linked to RacoonStealer info stealer via a shared IP
address, which RiskIQ systems saw dropped from 217.8.117[.]89/theCCnew/index.php via
our Crowdstrike intelligence integration. According to Ben Cohen at CyberArk, "Racoon is
used to steal sensitive and confidential information including login credentials, credit card
information, cryptocurrency wallets and browser information…" and is often delivered
through phishing campaigns or exploit kits.
Scale your Defense in Response
Magecart attacks have skyrocketed, with RiskIQ detecting new attacks every few minutes.
With more and more researchers looking into this growing threat, the massive scope of
Magecart's cybercrime empire and its mind-boggling intricacies is finally being exposed. In
response, organizations must have the intelligence necessary to scale their defense to meet
this growing threat and be aware of how Magecart affects its attack surface.
From just two email addresses, RiskIQ’s Internet Intelligence Graph was able to unearth
large swaths of Magecart infrastructure and connect them to other activity, a key capability in
protecting your organization from this top web-based threat. Be sure to check-in on RiskIQ's
Threat Intelligence portal as we continue to track Magecart and publish the intelligence that
can help you defend your organization. For the full report and full analysis, including IOCs,
