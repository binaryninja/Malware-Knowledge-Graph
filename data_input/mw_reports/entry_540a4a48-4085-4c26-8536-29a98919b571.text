I. Background
This is not the first time the TrickBot development group leverages LDAP; they also
developed a DomainGrabber module specifically to harvest sensitive domain controller
information, as detailed earlier. The group behind the TrickBot malware development
remains to be one of the most resourceful in the e-crime ecosystem continuously releasing
various modules (for example. password grabber “pwgrab32Dll” on October 19, 2018). The
module itself does not steal any point-of-sale data but rather used to profile corporate
machines of interest with possible point-of-sale devices. This module arrives just in time for
the holiday shopping season highlighting the group interest in exploring possible point-ofsale breaches. The question is: What point-of-sale malware would the group behind TrickBot
deploy on identified machines of interest, and/or would they auction this access to another
group? This question is yet to be answered.
II. Decoded TrickBot Point-of-Sale Finder “psfin32” Module 32-Bit (x86)

1/5

This tiny "psfin32" module DLL with the size of 18.13 KB (18568 bytes), compiled on
Monday, November 5, 09:00:47 2018 UTC, is originally called "dll[.]dll." The module itself
consists of only 24 functions.
The decoded Trickbot "pfin32Dll" module contains the usual Trickbot export functions:
Control
FreeBuffer
Release
Start

III. TrickBot Point-of-Sale Finder Module vs DomainGrabber Module: Code Analysis

The latest module consists visually a lot of similarity to their previous DomainGrabber
module. During pseudo source-code level analysis, it is revealed that the code contains 6
partial function matches (including perfect match and strongly connected components), 17
unreliable function matches (including same MD index and constants, strongly connected
components, similar small pseudo-code, strongly connected components small-primesproduct, and loop count). By and large, the pseudo source-code analysis reveals the new
module heavily borrows from the earlier DomainGrabber code and was likely coded by the
same developer(s).

IV. TrickBot Point-of-Sale Finder Module LDAP Analysis
This Trickbot module was programmed leveraging Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI)
APIs to search LDAP for objects possibly linked to point of sale related services, software,
and machines. To learn more about specific access ADsOpenObject and IADsContainer
interface, please refer to the DomainGrabber post.
LDAP provider is used to access Active Directory Domain Services. The LDAP binding string
takes the following form of "GC://" binding to the root of the namespace. "GC:" uses the
LDAP provider to bind to the Global Catalog service to execute queries.
The module queries for DOMAIN Global Catalog the following accesses:
COMPUTERS
USERS
GROUPS
SITES
OUs

The point-of-sale key terms of interest are as follows:
*POS*
*REG*
*CASH*
*LANE*
*STORE*
*RETAIL*
*BOH*
*ALOHA*
*MICROS*
*TERM*

V. TrickBot Point-of-Sale Finder Module POST Command
Once the information is harvested, the "Log" file with the information would be posted to the
TrickBot to "Dpost" servers via "/%s/%s/90" command.

3/5

Part of the export "Control" function, the module forms and communicates to the next-layer
network via the module network path ending in .../<GROUP ID>/<CLIENT ID>/90. The /90
ending is leveraged for POST requests with its content in the following three unique formats:
A. Content-Disposition: form-data; name="proclist"
B. Content-Disposition: form-data; name="sysinfo"
C. Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=Arasfjasu7

The unique value "Arasfjasu7" appears to be a marker/separator for the LDAP query
collection upload to split the harvested information.
