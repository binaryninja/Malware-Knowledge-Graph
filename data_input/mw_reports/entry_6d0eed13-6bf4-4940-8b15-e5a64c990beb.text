OFAC takes action in partnership with the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and
Australia
WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) designated five individuals and three entities related to Russia’s occupation
of the Crimea region of Ukraine and its severe human rights abuses against the local
population. These designations, pursuant to Executive Orders (E.O.) 13660 and 13685,
impose sanctions on individuals who have asserted governmental authority over the Crimea
region of Ukraine without the authorization of Ukraine, as well as target individuals and
entities for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Today’s actions demonstrate the
Department of the Treasury’s unwavering commitment to counter Russia’s attack on
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and Russia’s human rights abuses against
Ukrainians. Several of these individuals and entities have recently been sanctioned by the
European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), Canada, and Australia.
“This action, taken in close cooperation with our allies, represents the international
community’s firm commitment to hold Russia accountable for the attempted annexation of
Crimea,” said OFAC Director Andrea M. Gacki. “These designations impose additional costs
on Russia for its forceful integration with Crimea and highlight the abuses that have taken
place under Russia’s attempted annexation. The United States remains committed to
supporting Ukrainian sovereignty: Crimea is Ukraine.”

KERCH STRAIT BRIDGE
Following Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia sought to connect the
Russian mainland to the Crimea region of Ukraine, which is separated from Russia by the
Kerch Strait. In 2016, Russia began the construction of what would become the longest
bridge in Europe: a railway bridge over the Kerch Strait. In 2018, construction was
completed, linking Russia with the Crimea region of Ukraine. With our international partners,
the United States has continued to take targeted actions against persons involved in this
project, undertaken by Russia in furtherance of its illegitimate assertion of sovereignty over
Ukraine. For example, on January29, 2020, OFAC designated one individual and one entity
related to the construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge as well as seven so-called officials of
the so-called Republic of Crimea.
In partnership with our international allies, Treasury designated Leonid Kronidovich
Ryzhenkin (Ryzhenkin), Lenpromtransproyekt, and Joint-Stock Company The
Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Railway Line’s Construction Directorate in response to their
involvement in the construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge. The construction of the Kerch
Strait Bridge is a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and has been condemned by the
international community.
Ryzhenkin is a Russian national and the chief executive officer (CEO) of Mostotrest, a
Russian construction company that operates in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Mostotrest’s
share in the total construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge was worth more than $1.9 billion.
Mostotrest and its owner, Arkady Rotenberg, were previously designated by OFAC pursuant
to E.O. 13685 and E.O. 13661, respectively. Prior to Mostotrest, Ryzhenkin worked for
another designated Russian construction company, Stroygazmontazh, where he also
supervised projects related to the construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge. OFAC previously
designated Stroygazmontazh pursuant to E.O. 13661. Ryzhenkin was designated pursuant
to E.O. 13685 for being the leader of an entity operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine.
Ryzhenkin was previously designated by the EU and the UK in 2020 and in 2021 by Canada
and Australia.
Lenpromtransproyekt is a Russian company that designed the Kerch Strait Bridge.
Lenpromtransproyekt was designated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the Crimea
region of Ukraine. The company was previously designated by the EU and the UK in 2020
and in 2021 by Canada and Australia.
Joint-Stock Company The Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Railway Line’s Construction
Directorate is a Russian company thatparticipated in the construction of the railway for the
Kerch Strait Bridge. Joint-Stock Company The Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Railway Line’s

ABUSES AGAINST THE LOCAL POPULATION
The atrocious conditions at the Simferopol SIZO-1 pre-trial detention centerin Simferopol, in
the Crimea region of Ukraine, are emblematic of the widespread human rights abuses
perpetrated against Ukraine’s people. The notorious prison is known for severe abuses,
communicable diseases, poor and inhumane living conditions, and inadequate medical
assistance. Prisoners are known to freeze, starve, suffer from parasites, and be kept in
poorly ventilated, unsanitary cells. Among the wide variety of prisoners held at this
overcrowded prison are those detained on politically motivated criminal charges, as well as
Crimean Tatars and other Ukrainians held in indefinite detention. Simferopol SIZO-1 was
designated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine.

OFFICIALS CARRYING OUT THE OCCUPATION OF CRIMEA
Today’s action also targeted three Russian officials and a local official involved in Russia’s
occupation of and efforts to control and govern the Crimea region of Ukraine. These
bureaucrats are critical to the Russian government’s malign effort to exercise authority within
Ukrainian territory following Russia’s illegal seizure of Crimea. Individuals included in this
action were: Larisa Vitalievna Kulinich (Kulinich); Pavel Leonidovich Karanda
(Karanda); Leonid Mikhailiuk (Mikhailiuk); and Vladimir Nikolaevich Terentiev
(Terentiev).
Kulinich, a Ukrainian and Russian national, is theso-called Minister of Property and Land
Relations in the so-called Republic of Crimea. Previously, Kulinich was First Deputy Minister
of Property and Land Relations.

Republic of Crimea.
Mikhailiuk, a Russian national, is the so-called Chief of the Russian Intelligence Services’
Federal Security Service (FSB) Department in Crimea and Sevastopol. Prior to his
illegitimate position in Crimea, Mikhailiuk was the head of the FSB departments in Russia’s
Vologda and Kaliningrad oblasts.
Terentiev, a Russian national, is the so-calledHead of the Main Directorate of the
Investigative Committee in the so-called Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
