The stealthy BazarBackdoor malware is now being spread via website contact forms rather
than typical phishing emails to evade detection by security software.
BazarBackdoor is a stealthy backdoor malware created by the TrickBot group and is
now under development by the Conti ransomware operation. This malware provides threat
actors remote access to an internal device that can be used as a launchpad for further
lateral movement within a network.
The BazarBackdoor malware is usually spread through phishing emails that include
malicious documents that download and install the malware.
However, as secure email gateways have become better at detecting these malware
droppers, distributors are moving to new ways of spreading the malware.

Contact forms replacing emails
In a new report by Abnormal Security, analysts explain that a new distribution campaign
started in December 2021 targets corporate victims with BazarBackdoor, with the likely goal
of deploying Cobalt Strike or ransomware payloads.
Instead of sending phishing emails to the targets, the threat actors first use corporate
contact forms to initiate communication.
For example, in one of the cases seen by Abnormal's analysts, the threat actors posed as
employees at a Canadian construction company who submitted a request for a product
supply quote.
After the employee responds to the phishing email, the attackers send back a malicious ISO
file supposedly relevant to the negotiation.
Since sending these files directly is impossible or would trigger security alerts, the threat
actors use file-sharing services like TransferNow and WeTransfer, as shown below.

We reported a similar case of contact form abuse in August, where fake DMCA infringement
notices sent via contact forms were installing BazarBackdoor.
In April 2021, we also reported on a phishing campaign using contact forms to spread the
IcedID banking trojan and Cobalt Strike beacons.

Hiding BazarLoader
The ISO archive attachment contains a .lnk file and a .log file. The idea here is to evade AV
detection by packing the payloads in the archive and having the user manually extract them
after download.
The .lnk file contains a command instruction that opens a terminal window using existing
Windows binaries and loads the .log file, which is, in reality, a BazarBackdoor DLL.

When the backdoor is loaded, it will be injected into the svchost.exe process and contact
the command and control (C2) server to receive commands to execute.
Due to many of the C2 IPs being offline at the time of Abnormal's analysis, the researchers
couldn't retrieve the second-stage payload, so the ultimate goal of this campaign remains
unknown.
