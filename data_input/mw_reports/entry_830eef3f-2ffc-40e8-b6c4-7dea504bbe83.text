_Overview
SmokeLoader is a malware that generally acts as a backdoor and is commonly
used as a loader for other malware. Attributed to the criminal group Smoky
Spider, a group that uses SmokeLoader and Sasfis, loader and downloader
respectively. SmokeLoader has been used as a bot in infrastructures and
contains strong evasion capabilities as well as Anti-Analysis, Anti-VM and AntiDBG techniques.

_Technical Analysis
SmokeLoader appears on systems usually through phishing, although it can be
loaded by other PUP/PUA or malware. The main execution will revolve around
a document that will spawn the SmokeLoader which will run, in most of its
versions, a version of itself in a suspended state to inject code, after which it
will execute an explorer.exe that it will inject again in order to perform the
malicious C&C actions or download other files using legitimate software.

The samples that have been found have in most cases been detected as
packed, due to the high level of entropy contained in their sections.

2/9

At the initial point, we see how it tries to load libraries in RunTime, something
really useful since it prevents us from being able to discern its intentions if we
perform a basic static analysis, so it will obtain new functionalities during its
execution.

In some of the techniques used to hinder the analysis, such as code
obfuscation, we find different hidden calls, as well as abuses of RET to reach
calls that we will not see statically.

3/9

As mentioned above, it fetches libraries during runtime and is dedicated to
resolving APIs that it could use later on

4/9

At all times, it has control over what is running on the machine, as it
subsequently performs various Anti-Vm and Anti-dbg techniques, so having all
running processes mapped is always a good technique.

5/9

After this, it starts loading APIs that will serve it moments later, in which we will
see a routine that will be loading from memory and using LoadLibrary +
GetProcAddress

6/9

APIs:
CreateFileA
CreateWindowExA
CreateProcessA
WriteProcessMemory
ResumeThread
DefWindowProcA
NtWriteVirtualMemory
RegisterClassExA
GetStartupInfoA
SetThreadContext
GetCommandLineA
PostMessageA
VirtualAllocEx
CloseHandle
VirtualAlloc
VirtualFree
VirtualProtectEx
ExitProcess
GetMessageExtraInfo
WaitForSingleObject
NtUnmapViewOfSection
MessageBoxA
ReadProcessMemory
GetThreadContext
WriteFile
GetModuleFileNameA
GetFileAttributesA
WinExec
GetMessageA

Once it has the libraries, APIs and processes controlled, it creates a process in
suspended state, for this it uses CreateProcessInternalA that will call
CreateProcessInternalW entering 0x04 in dwCreationflags to create the
process in suspended state.

7/9

Once the process is created in a suspended state, it proceeds to introduce the
binary inside the previously spawned process, which, through
ProcessHollowing, will unmap data from itself, to write the binary inside, this is
usually done through ZwUnmapViewOfSection + VirtualAlloc +
ZwWriteVirtualMemory, once introduced into the memory of the process in
suspension, it will stop being suspended and will execute it, so the memory file
will be detonated.

[ The binary extracted from memory, which will inject explorer.exe, is very
interesting, we will follow soon :)
