Tuesday, February 15, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team

Summary
The ShadowPad advanced modular remote access trojan (RAT) has been deployed by the
Chinese government-sponsored BRONZE ATLAS threat group since at least 2017. A
growing list of other Chinese threat groups have deployed it globally since 2019 in attacks
against organizations in various industry verticals. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™
(CTU) analysis of ShadowPad samples revealed clusters of activity linked to threat groups
affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) civilian intelligence agency
and the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
Some clusters that target China's 'near abroad' appear to be linked to PLA theater
commands. These theater commands were introduced in the PLA reforms announced in
2015. Evidence of infrastructure and malware crossover among threat groups likely
operating within the same theater command suggests that PLA reforms could be
facilitating collaboration among these groups.
ShadowPad is decrypted in memory using a custom decryption algorithm. CTU™
researchers have identified multiple ShadowPad versions based on these distinct
algorithms. ShadowPad extracts information about the host, executes commands,
interacts with the file system and registry, and deploys new modules to extend
functionality. CTU researchers discovered that ShadowPad payloads are deployed to a
host either encrypted within a DLL loader or within a separate file alongside a DLL
loader. These DLL loaders decrypt and execute ShadowPad in memory after being
sideloaded by a legitimate executable vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking.

ShadowPad DLL loader execution
The majority of ShadowPad samples analyzed by CTU researchers were two-file execution
chains: an encrypted ShadowPad payload embedded in a DLL loader. ShadowPad DLL
loaders are sideloaded by a legitimate executable vulnerable to DLL search order
hijacking. The DLL loader then decrypts and executes the embedded ShadowPad payload
in memory using a custom decryption algorithm specific to the malware version. Table 1
lists legitimate executable and malicious DLL pairs that CTU researchers observed in
analyzed samples.

Table 1. Legitimate executable and DLL loader filenames used to load ShadowPad.
CTU researchers identified ShadowPad execution chains involving a third file that
contains the encrypted ShadowPad payload. These chains execute the legitimate
executable (usually renamed), sideload the ShadowPad DLL loader, and load and decrypt
the third file. CTU researchers observed threat actors using BDReinit.exe or Oleview.exe
as initial files in the three-file ShadowPad execution chain. The third file in the
BDReinit.exe execution chain is log.dll.dat; in the Oleview.exe execution chain, it is
iviewers.dll.dat. CTU researchers have attributed campaigns using these execution chains
to the Chinese BRONZE UNIVERSITY threat group, which has targeted transportation,
natural resource, energy, and non-governmental organizations. Third-party researchers
have also identified three-file ShadowPad execution chains that begin with consent.exe
(followed by secur32.dll and secur32.dll.dat) and AppLaunch.exe (followed by
mscoree.dll and mscoree.dll.dat). Additionally, CTU analysis revealed a sample that used
AppLaunch.exe followed by mscoree.dll and mscoree.dll.mui.
Other ShadowPad samples from 2018 also deviated from the typical two-file execution
chain. Those samples, which used the filename TSVIPSrv.DLL, are placed in the Windows
System32 directory and are loaded by the Windows SessionEnv Service, which is
vulnerable to DLL hijacking. CTU researchers observed BRONZE ATLAS using this
technique in 2021 to load other payloads via this filename, including Cobalt Strike.
CTU researchers discovered ShadowPad samples sharing behavioral similarities such as
injecting the decrypted ShadowPad payload into a newly launched target process and
establishing persistence on a compromised host specified in the configuration settings.

and control (C2) details, the process injection target, and persistence via creation of a
service and a registry Run key.

Figure 1. ShadowPad sample configuration information. (Source: Secureworks)
As part of the execution chain, ShadowPad copies the legitimate binary and sideloaded
DLL to a subdirectory specific to each sample. Most analyzed samples were copied to a
subdirectory under C:\ProgramData, C:\Users\<username>\Roaming, or C:\Program
Files. In three-file execution chains, the third file (e.g., log.dll.dat, iviewers.dll.dat) is
typically deleted and the ShadowPad DLL loader is padded to over 50MB, likely to evade
antivirus software. As part of this process, an encrypted payload is usually saved to a
registry key under HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{GUID}\<eight-character
hexadecimal string> (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Sample ShadowPad encrypted payload location. (Source: Secureworks)
After the initial setup the legitimate executable is launched as a Windows service. This
service initiates the ShadowPad execution chain. The ShadowPad payload is injected into
a child process of the service process that is specified in the ShadowPad configuration
information. Figure 3 shows the timeline of a ShadowPad execution chain (i.e., log.exe ->
log.dll -> log.dll.dat), followed by the service creation and execution of the copied files
(log.exe renamed to reg.exe), and the payload injection.

The BRONZE ATLAS/Chengdu 404 nexus
ShadowPad gained notoriety in 2017 after it was deployed in software supply chain
attacks involving CCleaner, NetSarang, and ASUS Live Update utility. These campaigns
were attributed to the BRONZE ATLAS threat group.
A 2017 Microsoft complaint and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indictments unsealed
in 2020 provide additional information on ShadowPad's connection to BRONZE ATLAS.
The Microsoft complaint alleges that BRONZE ATLAS (also known as Barium) deployed
ShadowPad in 2017 to steal intellectual property and personally identifiable information
(PII). At the time, the malware was used only by BRONZE ATLAS. The DOJ indictments
allege that Chinese nationals working for the Chengdu 404 network security company
deployed ShadowPad in a global campaign attributed to BRONZE ATLAS.

A related DOJ indictment revealed that these Chinese nationals collaborated with another
Chinese national known by the handle 'Rose' (sometimes known as Withered Rose and
Wicked Rose), using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and sharing
malware. The indictment describes this individual as a sophisticated threat actor who
committed computer intrusion offenses targeting high-technology organizations globally.
Campaigns linked to Rose were tracked as Barium.
A third-party report claimed that Rose likely co-developed malware with an associate
named 'whg,' who has been linked to the development of the PlugX malware. PlugX is
used by multiple Chinese threat groups. Third-party researchers also identified string and
code overlap between PlugX and ShadowPad. This overlap suggests close links between
the ShadowPad and PlugX developers. ShadowPad may have been developed by an
individual or group affiliated with BRONZE ATLAS. One possibility is that Chengdu 404
originally developed ShadowPad, as the individuals named in the DOJ indictments were
allegedly involved with developing malware used in their campaigns.
It is likely that only BRONZE ATLAS used ShadowPad until approximately 2019. Most of
the ShadowPad DLL loader samples can be clustered based on compile timestamps, C2
infrastructure, payload versions, DLL loader code overlap, and likely victimology. CTU
researchers identified multiple ShadowPad clusters used in campaigns since 2019 and
attributed these clusters to distinct threat groups. These groups include BRONZE ATLAS
and BRONZE UNIVERSITY, whose targeting suggests affiliation with the MSS. A thirdparty report suggests that BRONZE UNIVERSITY (referred to in the report as Earth
Lusca) may be operating near to Chengdu in China after operational security mistakes
revealed China-based infrastructure. Other ShadowPad clusters appear to reflect
targeting aligned with PLA theater command areas of responsibility.

PLA reforms
In late 2015, PRC leader Xi Jinping announced widespread reforms to the PLA that
included the establishment of the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF or SSF). This new
branch focuses on modernizing the PLA's capabilities in strategic frontiers of space,
cyberspace, and the electromagnetic domain. The impact on the PLA's cyberespionage
mission has been extensive. Many organizations responsible for cyberespionage and
signals intelligence (SIGINT) associated with the Third Department of the PLA's General
Staff Department (commonly known as 3PLA) have been absorbed into the SSF Network
Systems Department (NSD). The SSF NSD is also believed to be responsible for a broad
range of information warfare capabilities beyond cyberespionage, coordinating electronic
countermeasures as well as offensive and defensive cyber projects. Figure 7 shows the
likely SSF organizational structure.

Strategic Studies)
As part of the modernization, the PLA replaced its seven military regions with five theater
commands: Eastern, Southern, Western, Northern, and Central (see Figure 8). These
theater commands orchestrate ground, naval, air, and conventional missile forces for
military operations in their geographic area of responsibility. While the exact area of
responsibility for each theater command is ambiguous, they are broadly responsible for
specific threats within their respective regions:
Eastern Theater Command: Taiwan strait and East China sea
Southern Theater Command: South China sea
Northern Theater Command: Russia and the Korean peninsula
Western Theater Command: Central Asia and the Sino-Indian border
Central Theater Command: defends the capital and possibly provides support to
other theater commands

Figure 8. PLA theater command structure. (Source: The Jamestown Foundation)
Prior to the PLA reforms, each military region maintained at least one Technical
Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) to handle SIGINT and cyberespionage activities focused
on the military region's area of responsibility. The TRBs were distinct from the former
3PLA units that were located across China, but they may have been tasked by the 3PLA.
The relationship between the TRBs and the theater commands is unclear. The TRBs may
have been consolidated under the SSF NSD alongside former 3PLA units. It is also
possible that they continue to target countries in their area of responsibility but under the
command and control of the SSF NSD.

Connections to PLA-linked threat groups
CTU researchers grouped distinct ShadowPad activity clusters by targeted geographic
regions. Clusters align with the documented area of responsibility for three of the theater
commands: Northern, Southern, and Western. CTU researchers attribute some of the
ShadowPad activity to Chinese threat groups that have been publicly linked to specific
PLA units located in the corresponding theater commands:
Northern Theater Command: CTU researchers linked ShadowPad activity to
BRONZE HUNTLEY and BRONZE BUTLER, which are reportedly located in the
Northern Theater Command. These threat groups deployed ShadowPad against
targets in South Korea, Russia, Japan, and Mongolia. These regions align with the
Northern Theater Command's focus. In 2021, CTU researchers observed malware
and infrastructure overlap between the two threat groups, suggesting close
collaboration.

Western Theater Command: Some ShadowPad activity primarily targeted
countries neighboring China's western border, such as India and Afghanistan. CTU
researchers clustered this activity based on attacker-controlled infrastructure,
ShadowPad DLL loader variants such as ICEKILLER, and contextual information
from third-party sources. Third-party researchers linked some of these campaigns
to an individual working on behalf of the Western Theater Command. CTU analysis
did not reveal sufficient evidence to corroborate these claims, but the locations and
victimology are consistent with threat actors operating on behalf of the Western
Theater Command.
Southern Theater Command: CTU researchers identified activity that used a
specific ShadowPad version to target organizations in the South China Sea region.
BRONZE GENEVA is likely responsible for part of this activity based on overlap
between the C2 infrastructure for the Nebulae malware family associated with
BRONZE GENEVA and a ShadowPad sample analyzed by CTU researchers.

This attribution of ShadowPad campaigns to theater commands is based on the
submitter's location for ShadowPad malware samples uploaded to the VirusTotal analysis
service (potentially indicating the victim's country), the C2 domain names that appear to
reference specific regions (e.g., cloudvn. info suggests Vietnam targeting), contextual
information regarding the activity and victimology, and the absence of evidence that
ShadowPad samples with the same attributes were deployed in other regions.

Conclusion
Evidence available as of this publication suggests that ShadowPad has been deployed by
MSS-affiliated threat groups, as well as PLA-affiliated threat groups that operate on
behalf of the regional theater commands. The malware was likely developed by threat
actors affiliated with BRONZE ATLAS and then shared with MSS and PLA threat groups
around 2019. Given the range of groups leveraging ShadowPad, all organizations that are
likely targets for Chinese threat groups should monitor for TTPs associated with this
malware. Organizations with operations in or connections to geographic regions covered
by the regional theater commands should specifically monitor for known TTPs associated
with threat groups likely affiliated with the relevant theater command.
