Event Viewer
If you’ve been doing some digital forensics or threat hunting for some time. You’ll know that
one of the key sources of information are the Windows event logs. Most of the talks around
the windows event logs only mention the “main” sources of logs such as “System” or
“Application”, even though windows provide many sources.

1/6

To get the full logging experience one need to enable additional logging from the or even
installs something like but what to do in the case where one cannot install or enable the
aforementioned logs? Or let’s say you’re performing an investigation and the machine has
only default logging enabled ? Does the windows event log contains other useful information
other than the one provided by the main sources (Application, System and Security) ?
Today we’ll take a look at some of those event logs and see if there is anything interesting.

Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Core/Operational
Detects the start of the execution of a process from both the
“Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” and
“Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce” registry keys with the full
command line.

Detects when the aforementioned process finishes execution with the corresponding
PID (Useful when the process is still running on the system).

Triggered when a shortcut is added to the “App Resolver Cache”. Indicates when an
application is installed.

Both EID 9707 and 9708 can be used to search for any malware using the “Run” and
“RunOnce” key as persistence mechanisms.

Microsoft-Windows-WinINet-Config/ProxyConfigChanged

2/6

Indicates change in the proxy configuration. For example if i change my proxy
configuration from the “Internet Option” menu. The event will get generated.

Microsoft-Windows-VHDMP-Operational
Triggers when you mount a VHD (Virtual Hard Disk).

Triggers when you unmount a VHD (Virtual Hard Disk).

Contains information about the type, path, handle count of the mounted device.

OAlerts (Office Alerts)
Triggers when a prompt is shown inside an office application. For example when the
prompt to save the office (excel, word…etc) document is shown an event is generated.
Contains information about the name of the files (In the case of saving a file), the office
version, the office application that triggered the alert (Word, PowerPoint, Excel…etc).
This event can be used to determine if a suspicious for example file has been opened or
altered in some way by a user.

Microsoft-Windows-WLAN-AutoConfig/Operational
Triggers when a successful connection to a wireless network occurs.
Triggers when we’re successfully disconnected from a wireless network.

3/6

Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon/Operational
Triggers when a user logon to a machine. You can check for the “<SessionEnv>”
subscriber notification in EID 811 to indicates that a user logged on via RDP.
Note that as far as i can tell the “SessionEnv” subscriber is also logged when a user logon to
a machine for the first time (I.E doesn’t have a session). To distinguish between the two
(RDP or Local) look for the EID 1/2 shortly after the “SessionEnv” subscriber to indicate a
local logon and if not present that means its an RDP logon.

In my test lab this event is triggered only when a user log in to a computer on which he
doesn’t have a session (I.E session disconnected/ doesn’t exist). EID 2 can be used to
determine how many times a user typed an incorrect password.
For example, if a user provided a wrong password and EID 2 will be generated with the
“Result Code : 1326”. Which indicates an incorrect password.

4/6

If the password is correct, then the “Result Code : 0” is generated.

Microsoft-Windows-Windows Firewall With Advanced
Security/Firewall
Trigger when “A rule has been to the Windows Defender Firewall exception list.
Triggers when “A rule has been in the Windows Defender Firewall exception list.”
Triggers when “A rule has been in the Windows Defender Firewall exception list.”
Contains information about :
The “Rule Name” that’s been altered.
The “Modifying Application” that initiated the change.
The “Action” and “Direction”
The “User”.
…Etc.

Microsoft-Windows-UniversalTelemetryClient/Operational

5/6

Indicates whether the computer has Internet or Not.
You can use the difference between two events to determine why a process didn’t run
(Maybe it needed internet) or answer the question did the malware send information to the
C2 since the start of the infection for example.

Microsoft-Windows-Security-Mitigations/KernelMode
Another event log worth looking is the “Microsoft-Windows-Security-Mitigations/*”. This event
log contains log about the “Exploit Protection” feature. A complete list of the EID’s available
can be found below.

Conclusion
We’ve taken a look at a couple of event logs that can be very useful during an investigation
or a threat hunt. If you have other suggestions of events that should be added or noticed an
error of some kind drop me a DM on twitter @nas_bench
Happy Hunting.
