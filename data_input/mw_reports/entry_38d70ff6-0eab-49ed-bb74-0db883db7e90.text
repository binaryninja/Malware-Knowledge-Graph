German chemicals giant Bayer claims it has found malware from a Winnti hacker group in
China which attacked the company in early 2018. The attack is part of a rising wave of
cyberattacks worrying firms.

A group of hackers known as Wicked Panda accessed Bayer's network in early 2018, the
company said in a statement on Thursday.
The hackers reportedly used Winnti malware, which had also been detected at three other,
smaller, companies in Germany this year.
Winnti is a China-based hacker groups, of which Wicked Panda is believed to be a member.
In Germany they already targeted the computer systems of technology group
ThyssenKrupp in 2016.
"This type of attack points towards the Wicked Panda group in China, according to security
experts," a company spokesman said, citing evidence gathered by the DCSO cybersecurity
group, which was set up by Bayer in 2015 and includes other German companies such
Allianz, BASF and Volkswagen.

Bayer, Germany's largest drugmaker, said it had covertly monitored and analyzed the attack
up to the end of this March and then cleared the threat from its systems."There is no
evidence of data theft," the statement goes on.
While public prosecutors in Cologne, Germany have opened an investigation into the
incident, the former head of Germany's BND foreign intelligence service, Gerhard Schindler,
said on Thursday it was difficult to determine the hackers' location.
Bayer is also the world's largest agricultural supplies company after it has taken over US
chemicals maker Monsanto.
Germany watchful
The news comes in the wake of one of Germany's biggest data breaches, in which the
private data of almost 1,000 public figures were leaked in January, including email
conversations and private photos. Cybersecurity has become a matter of urgency for
German politics after the United States has ramped up pressure on its allies to desist using
Chinese firm Huawei technology in the roll out of 5G internet.
Germany’s Office for Security in Information Technology (BSI) recently issued a warning to
several German companies seen as potential targets for Chinese cyber espionage. There
are mounting fears in Germany that Chinese hackers could be targeting companies involved
in construction and materials research, engineering firms and big commercial enterprises.
According to a BSI report in February, Germany has seen a rising number of incidents hitting
critical infrastructure, such as power grids and water suppliers. Among the companies most
recently targeted by the Chinese hackers was the Hagen Hohenlimburg specialty steel mill in
western Germany.
Technical trade secrets were stolen from the steel production and manufacturing plant design
divisions of ThyssenKrupp in the attacks. At the time, the company said it had been targeted
by attackers located in Southeast Asia. In 2014, a blast furnace at a steelworks in Germany
was also badly damaged by a cyber attack, resulting in "massive damage to machinery" at
the unnamed German steel mill.
This followed an attack on Deutsche Telekom routers that caused outage for nearly 1 million
customers.
Costs
According to a survey published by Germany's IT sector association Bitkom in 2018, two
thirds of German manufacturers have already come under the attack of cybercriminals. The
association estimates that this costs Europe's largest economy €43 billion ($50 billion)
annually.

Bitkom has also found that small and medium-sized companies are particularly vulnerable to
attacks. Some 19 percent of those polled said their IT and production systems had been
sabotaged digitally, with 11 percent reporting tapping of their communications.
