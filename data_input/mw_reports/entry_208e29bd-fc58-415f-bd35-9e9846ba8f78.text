A close look at the advanced techniques used in a Malaysianfocused APT campaign

June 25, 2020

The Elastic Security Intelligence & Analytics Team researches adversary innovations of
many kinds, and has recently focused on an activity group that leveraged remote
templates, VBA code evasion, and DLL side-loading techniques. Based on code similarity
and shared tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the team assessed this activity to
be possibly linked to a Chinese-based group known as APT40, or Leviathan. The group’s
campaign appears to target Malaysian government officials with a lure regarding the
2020 Malaysian political crisis.

Anatomy of the attack

Figure 2: Lure document image

To initiate their advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, the group likely delivered a
Microsoft Word document as a phishing lure attachment. The image used in the lure
(Figure 2) appears to be crafted from a broadcast announcement shared by a Malaysian
blogger (Figure 1). The lure image includes the same broadcast time, but the date and
speech topic are removed. Once this attachment is opened, a decoy document is
presented while behind the scenes, taking the following actions:
The lure document downloads the remote template RemoteLoad.dotm

The remote template executes VBA macro code
The VBA macro code unpacks and executes two embedded base64-encoded DLLs
(sl1.tmp and sl2.tmp) to c:\users\public\
This technique is known as template injection, which you may recall from our Playing
defense against Gamaredon Group blog post. This an effective approach used by
adversaries to bypass perimeter controls such as email gateways.

Figure 4: Obfuscation of MZ/PE header base64
Both embedded DLLs ( sl1.tmp and sl2.tmp ) are similar and export the same
function names: RCT and RCP . The first DLL ( sl1.tmp ) is used to download a benign
executable called LogiMailApp.exe and an associated library LogiMail.dll , and the
second DLL ( sl2.tmp ) is used to execute LogiMailApp.exe , which automatically
attempts to execute LogiMail.dll due to an inherent DLL search order vulnerability
we’ll cover shortly.

Table 1: Dropped files metadata

Figure 5: Download and execution of LogiMailApp.exe and LogiMail.dll
This implementation stood out to our researchers due to a behavioral idiosyncrasy:
The Microsoft Office application winword.exe loads sl1.tmp and sl2.tmp DLLs uses
the LoadLibraryA method, which is moderately rare
These DLLs run explicit commands or install a payload from a URL using the
CallWindowProcA method, which appears to be exceptionally rare
Both DLLs are deleted after execution

Figure 6: Download and execution module deletion

Embedded DLLs
The embedded DLLs, sl1.tmp and sl2.tmp , have very limited functionality —
exporting the RCP and RCT functions. The RCP function implements the WinExec
method to execute commands where the RCT function uses the URLDownloadToFileA
method to download a file from a specified URL.

Figure 7: Exported functions – RCP and RCT

DLL side-loading a backdoor
LogiMailApp.exe , which is downloaded by sl1.tmp and executed by sl2.tmp, is

vulnerable to a form of DLL search-order hijacking called side-loading, which
automatically searches for and executes LogiMail.dll if found in the same directory.
Forms of DLL search-order hijacking can be used with many third-party software
applications. In this case, search-order hijacking was used to load a backdoor that exports
the following notable functions:

Figure 10: LogiMail.dll side-loading
The adversary-created binary LogiMail.dll exports the function DllGetClassObject
that contains critical logic for the execution flow of this sample:
1. Download an AES-encrypted second stage object to %TEMP%\~liseces1.pcs
2. Derive a 128-bit AES key and initialization vector from SHA256 of a hardcoded
string
3. Read and decrypt %TEMP%\~liseces1.pcs in memory using the ReadFile and
CryptDecrypt functions
4. Delete %TEMP%\~liseces1.pcs from disk

Second stage backdoor
The decrypted second stage backdoor is mapped into memory and then its original entry
point (OEP) is called, thus bypassing successful detections based on file system scanning.

Possible APT40/Leviathan connection
Earlier in the year, the Malaysian Computer Emergency Response Team (MyCERT)
issued an advisory related to espionage activity targeting their country. The report listed
different TTPs and included multiple samples and other technical indicators that align
with a threat group known as APT40/Leviathan.
At a high level, this sample follows the continued trend of targeting Malaysian victims
using specific TTPs such as remote templates, employing macros, using DLL side-loading
techniques, and leveraging an in-memory implant with dynamic DNS for command and
control. More specifically, the second stage implant from this lure shares unique strings
and URL references and contains similar functionality that correlates with the previous
reporting for APT40/Leviathan. With these similarities, our Intelligence & Analytics
Team assesses with moderate confidence that this activity is linked to APT40/Leviathan.

Conclusion
In this post, we highlighted a recent sample that most likely represents the work of a
highly organized adversary. Activity groups like this are significant for everyone to take
notice of, if only because they represent a higher maturity level of post-exploit innovation.
Their cutting edge TTPs today end up being everyone’s run of the mill tomorrow; it’s
important to learn from these events.
We hope that by sharing some of these insights, we can help raise awareness and continue
to focus on protecting the world's data from attack. To enable organizations further, we’ve
added all the observed MITRE ATT&CK® techniques and indicators of compromise
(IoCs) below.
