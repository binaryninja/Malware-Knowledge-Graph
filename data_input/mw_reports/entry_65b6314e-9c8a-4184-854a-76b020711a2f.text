Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report

“Miscreants are continuing to find new and creative ways
to exploit network, system, and even human vulnerabilities
to steal information or do damage. The challenge is that
we need to block their exploits 100 percent of the time if
we are to protect our networks and information. They can
be right once; we have to be right all of the time. We need
to be ever-vigilant in our efforts to protect our assets,
information, and ourselves online.”
—John N. Stewart, vice president and chief security officer, Cisco

The Exploitation of Trust:
Cybercriminals’ Most Powerful Weapon
Whether they’re creating malware that can subvert
industrial processes or tricking Facebook users into
handing over login and password information, today’s
cybercriminals have a powerful weapon at their disposal:
the exploitation of trust. They have become skilled at
convincing users that their infected links and URLs are
safe to click on, and that they are someone the user
knows and trusts. And with stolen security credentials,
they can freely interact with legitimate software
and systems.
When trust is exploited, more damage can be done with
fewer intrusions—the criminal essentially has been given
permission to wreak havoc on compromised systems
and software. “Miscreants are continuing to find new
and creative ways to exploit network, system, and even
human vulnerabilities to steal information or do damage,”
says John N. Stewart, vice president and chief security
officer for Cisco. “The challenge is that we need to block
their exploits 100 percent of the time if we are to protect
our networks and information. They can be right once;
we have to be right all of the time. We need to be evervigilant in our efforts to protect our assets, information,
and ourselves online.”
People by nature are inclined to trust others, and
criminals use this to their advantage again and
again. Take the case of the fake social networking
profiles established earlier this year for “Robin Sage,”
supposedly a young, attractive woman working in
the national security arena. A security expert created

the fake profiles as a test to see how many security
professionals might be fooled by Sage’s persona and
share information with her. About 300 people within
the United States military and government, as well
as security companies, connected with “Robin.” If
even sophisticated security experts fail to think twice
before exposing personal and corporate information to
strangers, imagine what the average employee might
do with your proprietary data. (Read more about the
Robin Sage fake profiles on page 17.)

Another type of exploitation involves “money mules”—
individuals who help launder money by accepting and
transferring funds earned in online scams. Money mules
are sometimes criminals; more often, however, they
are people in need of money who are tempted into this
activity by “work at home” spam. Regardless of whether
they are willing participants or unsuspecting victims,
money mules are integral to enabling criminals to profit
from their campaigns. Users can limit these operations
by not becoming unwitting accomplices.

Hackers are also taking advantage of new opportunities
to make money. In response to vulnerability exploits
in various Windows PC operating systems, Microsoft
has improved security in Windows 7 and taken a more
aggressive approach to patching vulnerabilities. This
makes it tougher for scammers to infiltrate Windows 7
effectively; having reached the Windows vulnerability
“tipping point” (see page 30), they have moved on to
other operating systems, applications, software services,
and devices such as smartphones, iPads, and iPods.
Apple and its products, including iPhones, iPads, and
the iTunes media service, have all experienced upticks
in exploits. Just as important in driving this trend is
the embrace of mobile devices and applications by
consumers and enterprises.

The subject of trust is also in play in the ongoing struggle
of governments to work together to combat cybercrime.
Governments recognize the need to develop common
standards for security solutions, yet they also want
autonomy over how technology is deployed within their
borders. Some countries and companies are leading
efforts to expand the reach of these common standards,
since they present the best opportunity for improved
security and continued product innovation.

The worldwide adoption of mobile devices presents
even more opportunities for intrusions and theft. While
security researchers have identified many focused
scams that target mobile devices, a widespread
incident is almost certainly on its way. To date, scams
have targeted select groups of mobile users, such
as customers of a specific bank. The massive and
relatively new market for mobile applications also offers
new markets for criminals. Researchers have detected
exploits in which wallpaper apps for Android Market,
the app store for the Android mobile operating system,
have been collecting mobile subscriber information and
sending it to a website owned by a scammer.

Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report

Announcing the 2010
Winners of the Cisco
Cybercrime Showcase
As you read the Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report,
you’ll find many stories about the bad guys whose
craftiness and lack of morals have brought them
to new heights of criminality this year. At the same
time, the security industry is fortunate to have
“superheroes” who work ceaselessly to bring down
the evildoers and help us understand and combat
criminal escapades. This year, Cisco is presenting
two awards: one for “Good” and one for “Evil.”

“The work of Thorsten Holz and his
researchers highlights how vital it is
for the academic, corporate, and
legal communities to work together
to weaken and flatten online criminal
enterprises. This type of private-public
partnership should be nurtured and
supported to gain ground against
increasingly sophisticated online
criminals.”
—Adam Golodner, director of global security
and technology policy, Cisco

The Good:
Thorsten Holz

The EVIL:
Stuxnet

Ruhr-University Bochum/LastLine
If it weren’t for researchers like
Thorsten Holz, an assistant professor
at Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany
and senior threat analyst for security
firm LastLine, we’d all be receiving a lot more spam.
Up until mid-2010, a massive spam botnet known
as Pushdo or Cutwail was responsible for sending
as much as 10 percent of all spam messages
worldwide. Then, Holz and his associates at
LastLine—professors and graduate students from
the technology departments of several leading
universities—identified the 30 Internet servers used
to control Pushdo/Cutwail, contacted the hosting
providers, and urged them to take down the servers.1
The result: After providers agreed to shut down 20 of
the servers, spam dropped from an average weekday
volume of 350 billion a day to 300 billion a day.
Just as dramatic was the takedown of the Waledac
botnet, which at its peak in 2009 was delivering
1.5 million spam messages daily. In February 2010,
Holz and several colleagues from academic and
corporate institutions identified the almost 300 web
domains controlled by the Waledac perpetrators and
convinced a federal judge to grant an order against
service providers to shut down these domains
and transfer their ownership to Microsoft, thereby
crippling the botnet.

The Stuxnet worm, whose earliest
versions appear to date to 2009, differs
from its malware “cousins” in that it has
a specific, damaging goal: to traverse
to industrial control systems so it can reprogram
the programmable logic controllers (PLCs), possibly
disrupting industrial operations. It’s not gathering
credit card numbers to sell off to the highest bidder,
and it’s not selling fake pharmaceuticals—it appears to
have been created solely to invade public or private
infrastructure. (For more on Stuxnet, see page 21.)
Stuxnet’s cleverness lies in its ability to traverse nonnetworked systems, which means that even systems
unconnected to networks or the Internet are at risk.
Federal News Radio’s website called Stuxnet “the
smartest malware ever.”
“Stuxnet bears watching in 2011 because it breaks
the malware mold,” advises Kurt Grutzmacher,
network consulting engineer at Cisco. “Malware that
is designed to disrupt industrial control systems in
critical infrastructure should be a concern for every
government.” Fortunately, fixes are already available
for the vulnerabilities exploited by Stuxnet—but
Stuxnet is likely just the first in an expected long
line of “hypertargeted” malware creations.

The Cisco Cybercrime Return
on Investment (CROI) Matrix
Where will most cybercriminals channel their resources in 2011?
Cisco security experts offer their predictions based on recent and
emerging trends in the shadow economy.

The Cisco CROI Matrix made its debut in the Cisco
2009 Annual Security Report and is used to track
the performance of cybercrime operations, which
increasingly are managed and organized in ways similar
to sophisticated, legitimate businesses. Specifically,
this matrix highlights the types of aggressive actions
Cisco security experts predict cybercriminals are likely
to focus most of their resources toward developing,
refining, and deploying in the year ahead.

Cash Cows: As predicted in 2009, many cybercriminals
were content to sit back and relax during 2010 and let
road-tested techniques, such as scareware and spyware,
click fraud, advanced-fee fraud, and pharma spam, help
them make a profit. Expect to see these “cash cows”
maintain their role as workhorses for cybercriminals
during 2011—although spammers, particularly those
responsible for high volumes of spam traffic, may need
to be more cautious. Law enforcement agencies are
taking action to address the global spam epidemic by
targeting some of the most egregious offenders.

Potentials category. Cisco security experts predict that
social networking scams will not be a significant area
for cybercriminals to invest their resources in the
year ahead. It’s not that social networking scams are
declining, but they are just a small part of a bigger plan—
launching web exploits, such as last year’s campaign
to lure users of LinkedIn into downloading the Zeus
Trojan (see page15). Thus, less up-front research and
development are required for social networking scams.
Criminals know they work.

Appearing again in the “Dogs” category are phishing
1.0 scams (unsophisticated attempts to steal user
credentials and other sensitive information). So, too,
are distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, despite
some notable incidents this year. For instance, in late
September 2010, a DDoS attack was launched by hacker
website 4Chan against the Motion Picture Association
of America’s (MPAA) webpage. Dubbed “Operation
Payback,” the attack was retribution for the MPAA trying
to halt the activity of websites that distribute copyrighted
content and users who download illegal copies of
movies. Film studios had reportedly paid Indian firm
Aiplex Software to attack torrent websites in a similar
manner.2 And even in light of the recent spate of DDoS
attacks against a number of companies that had cut off
services to WikiLeaks.org following the nonprofit media
organization’s release of confidential U.S. government
documents on its website, it is unlikely these types of
attacks, which tend to be highly targeted and retaliatory,
will be a major investment category for the general
cybercrime community looking to make a profit in 2011.
Potentials: According to research firm IDC, the number
of mobile devices—from smartphones to tablet PCs—
accessing the Internet by 2013 will surpass 1 billion,3
creating more opportunities for cybercrime (see The
Tipping Point, page 30). The massively successful
banking Trojan, Zeus—which, according to the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has played a key
role in the theft of more than US$70 million from 400
U.S. organizations over the past several years—is already

being adapted for the mobile platform.4 In late 2009,
SymbOS/Zitmo.Altr appeared; researchers believe it was
designed to intercept confirmation SMS messages sent
by banks to their customers. (Note: “Zitmo” stands for
“Zeus in the Mobile.”)5 It appears the mobile malware,
which users download after falling prey to a social
engineering ploy, is designed to defeat the SMS-based
two-factor authentication most banks use to confirm
online funds transfers by customers.
Meanwhile, VoIP abuse has been on the upswing and
appears poised for further growth. Criminals use bruteforce techniques to hack private branch exchange (PBX)
systems to place fraudulent, long-distance calls—usually
international. These incidents, often targeting small or
midsize businesses, have resulted in significant financial
losses for some companies. VoIP systems are being
used to support vishing (telephone-based phishing)
schemes, which are growing in popularity. In one recent
vishing scam targeting the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC), vishers called U.S. consumers via
mobile and land-line phones to inform them they were
delinquent in loan payments that had been applied for
over the Internet or made through a payday lender.6
Criminals were able to collect personal information,
such as Social Security numbers (SSNs), from victims.
Rising stars: The Zeus Trojan, and the entire field of
lucrative, easy-to-deploy web exploits, like those seen
in 2009 and 2010, will continue to receive significant
investment from cybercriminals in 2011. The aptly
named Zeus, which is powerful, pervasive, and targeting
everything from bank accounts to government networks,
has become extremely sophisticated and is much more

customizable; as of October 2010, there were hundreds
of different Zeus botnets known to security researchers.
(See page 15 to learn about the recent Zeus exploit
involving fake LinkedIn spam alerts, and page 23 for
details on the Zeus-related fake Apple iTunes spam
event.) However, the attention Zeus commands is
making it easier for other highly sophisticated but less
widespread Trojans such as Bugat, Carberp, and SpyEye
to avoid detection. Also of note: In October 2010, Brian
Krebs, who was spotlighted as a “Cybercrime Hero” in
the Cisco 2009 Cybercrime Showcase, reported in his
Krebs on Security blog that malware developers were
merging the Zeus codebase with that of the SpyEye
Trojan to create an especially potent threat for “a more
exclusive and well-heeled breed of cyber crook.”7
Cisco security experts anticipate that the real focus of
cybercriminal investment for 2011, however, will be on
improving the success and expanding the number of
cash-out services (“money muling” operations). These
operations, which have been discussed in previous
Cisco security reports, are a vital component of the
cybercrime lifecycle and are becoming more elaborate
and international in scope. Zeus is often in the mix here,
as well: See page 11 to read about its central role in a
complex international money muling scheme operated
by Eastern European gangs that was recently exposed
by United Kingdom and U.S. law enforcement.

Money Mules: The Linchpins
of Cybercrime Networks
Cybercriminals need “hired help” to launder their ill-gotten
gains—but rounding up new recruits is a never-ending
process, as most money mules have short-lived careers.

While online scammers have no difficulty stealing
enough information to use their victims’ credit cards and
access their online bank accounts, they still need a way
to get paid in the physical world, and thus, turn to money
mules who facilitate money laundering. Money mules are
individuals recruited by handlers or “wranglers” to set
up bank accounts, or even use their own bank accounts,
to assist in the transfer of money from a fraud victim’s
account to another location—usually overseas—via a wire
transfer or automated clearing house (ACH) transaction.
One major hitch with any type of cash-out operation
involving money mules is that there simply aren’t enough
mules in service. Mules typically work only one day
before they are either abandoned by their handler or
are taken into custody by law enforcement. As the
cybercriminal economy continues to expand, it will be
increasingly challenging for scammers to maintain an
adequate supply of these temporary “employees” to
profit fully from their exploits: One money mule expert
estimates that the ratio of stolen account credentials
to available mule capacity already could be as high
as 10,000 to 1.
So, what type of people serve as money mules? They
can be lower-level criminals willing to engage in a shady
financial transaction to make some quick cash. Someone
who is aware of his or her role as a money mule often
believes that he or she is somehow “smarter than the
average mule”—and therefore, will never be caught by
authorities. Or, they do not believe what they are doing is
that serious, and think, perhaps, “Well, what’s the worst
thing that could happen?” Not surprisingly, many money
mules are caught quickly. Often, they face substantial
fines—even jail time.

However, mules are quite often individuals seeking
legitimate employment who end up being lured by
too-good-to-be true job offers such as “Earn
Thousands Working at Home!” Some ads, designed
to appeal to people struggling with consumer debt,
lure in victims with calls to action like, “Get Out of Debt
Now!” These offers are often sent via spam, but some
operations still advertise in the physical world with
posters, flyers, and newspaper ads. People scouring
employment ads on legitimate, well-known job search
sites also have been duped by these scams. And given
the challenging economic environment of the past few
years, recruiters for money mules are likely finding their
inboxes brimming with job application materials from
potential candidates for hire.

Currently, the ratio of stolen
account credentials to available
mule capacity could be as
high as 10,000 to 1.
Students are often targets for money mule recruiters,
as are those simply looking for an “easy” way to make
extra cash. A mule may be promised a monthly base
salary, as well as a small commission (for example,
US$50) per successful transaction. Some mules are
told they can keep 5 percent per transaction, minus any
wire transfer fees. As most mule handlers aim for mules
to withdraw up to US$10,000 per transaction (amounts
over that figure trigger a financial institution’s antimoney laundering controls), the potential “earnings”
are attractive. But even if they do make money in the
short term, mules often pay a high price for their
involvement in facilitating a crime: When a bank detects
fraud, the mule, once identified by authorities, is often
held responsible for repaying the money that was
illegally transferred.

The more sophisticated cash-out organizations act
as legitimate financial services firms. Individuals who
come in contact with these operations usually have
no idea they are being recruited as money mules, and
believe they are dealing with a recruiter for a legitimate
company. Quite often, they have responded to an ad
on an online employment site for a position with a title
such as “regional assistant,” “company representative,”
or “payment processor.” The contact the applicant
interacts with online or by phone plays the role of human
resources specialist, and when the victim inquires about
vacation time, the availability of a 401(k) plan, or whether
the “company” honors the U.S. Family and Medical
Leave Act, they are provided a satisfying answer. As
part of the “hiring process,” mules are asked to provide
sensitive information to the handlers, such as images
of their government-issued identification.
Once hired, money mules are expected to work in a
short time window—usually from around 9 to 11 a.m.—so
that cash can be wired out of their account before a
financial institution’s security staff are able to respond
to an incident of suspected fraud. (Mules also must own
a cell phone; in fact, not having one is a deal-breaker.
They won’t get the job.) Mule operatives instruct mules
to open two bank accounts: one for their “salary” and
another for “funds.” They also tell the mules to provide
them with the online banking passwords for those
accounts so they are able to check the balances. Mules
are then asked to locate their local Western Union and
Moneygram branches so that the cash-out process
can commence; wire transfers, even though they require
a fee to be paid up front by the sender, are typically
very fast transactions, and don’t require a bank accountto-bank account transfer.

Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report

It is not unusual for criminals to recruit dozens of money
mules to stage just one large operation, or keep several
on hand for repeat check-cashing and wire-transfer
assignments. For example, one money mule recruitment
and management website managed more than 4100
mules working in the United States during the course
of a single year. Experts have noted that criminals, for
reasons not entirely clear, prefer to hire East Coast
residents when setting up money muling operations
in the United States.

The money mule recruiter
responds to the applicant via
email. The charade may include
asking for more detail about the
applicant’s experience, and
explaining “employment benefits.”

The following are examples of common cash-out
systems that involve money mules:

Operation 1:
Standard money is placed into legitimate in-country
accounts via wire transfers (for example, Western Union)
or ACH transactions. Mules are recruited to use their
own accounts. Criminals move stolen money into these
accounts. As an example, a mule conducts transactions
at three or four Western Union locations, each time
sending approximately US$3,000 by wire transfer to
an overseas location. These wire transfers are often
redirected after they are posted—using information
the mule provided when he or she entered the mule
organization, such as bank account information—so the
mule doesn’t know the true final destination for the funds.

Operation 2:
J-1 visa holders who obtain permission to work in the
United States for short periods, such as for seasonal
work, are recruited by money mule operatives in their
country. While in the United States, the J-1 visa
holders/money mules set up bank accounts in major
metropolitan areas using bogus names and passports
provided by their contacts. Information about money

Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report

The mule reports back
to the handler by cell
phone or email. The
handler tells the mule
to await further
instruction.

The mule is hired and
told to work from 9 to 11
a.m. on the first day
(which is usually the last
day, too). The mule is
instructed to open two
bank accounts, one for
“funds” and one for
“salary,” and to provide
credentials for accessing
the accounts. The mule
is also asked to locate
local Western Union and
Moneygram locations.

Money mule operators
(or other mules)
collect the wired
money at overseas
location(s). The funds
may be wired again to
conceal the true
destination(s) for
the funds.

Once the money muling operatives
transfer money from victims’ bank
accounts and into the “funds”
account, the handler contacts the
mule to say the money is ready to
be withdrawn and wired.

The mule awaits
further instruction.
From here, the mule
is usually abandoned
by the handler, and
may even be arrested
(once fraud is
detected) and can
go to jail and/or
be expected to pay
back funds illegally
taken from victims’
accounts.

The mule takes the
money out of the bank
(always less than
US$10,000 at a time
to help avoid fraud
detection), and heads
to a Western Union
or similar location to
make a wire transfer.
The money is wired
overseas to one or
more locations.

muling assignments is spread by word of mouth or
through social networking, which is becoming an
increasingly important tool for cybercriminals looking
to spread their cash-out operations around the globe.
An example of a money muling operation that targets
J-1 visa holders is the Russian site “Work & Travel USA,”
which has a Facebook-like page with more than
50,000 “friends.”
In September 2010, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in
Manhattan announced that it had charged 37 individuals
from Russia and Eastern European countries—most of
them in the United States on J-1 nonimmigrant visas—
for their participation in a sophisticated scheme involving
the Zeus banking Trojan and a team of money mules
who stole funds from dozens of U.S. business accounts.
The operation, which primarily targeted the bank
accounts of small businesses and small municipalities,
was code-named ACHing Mules because it involved
unauthorized ACH transactions (see sidebar, “The
Appeal of Automated Clearing House Transactions for
Money Mule Operations” on page 12).
Earlier that same month, U.K. authorities charged 11
Eastern European citizens in connection with the same
scam.8 According to authorities, at least US$3 million
was stolen from U.S. accounts from May to September
2010 through this specific money muling operation. In
the United Kingdom, as much as US$9.5 million was
siphoned from U.K. bank accounts. Money mules used
units of Bank of America Corp. and TD Bank Financial
Group to open accounts for laundering the money.9

Operation 3:
Because banks and credit card companies are becoming
more adept at deterring fraud, some cybercriminals
are turning to reshipping scams as a way to cash out. A
scammer uses stolen or fake credit card or bank account
information to purchase merchandise—usually, popular
consumer electronics such as MP3 players, laptops,
or flat-screen TVs—from e-commerce or auction sites.
Since criminals obviously cannot send the goods to their
own address, they rely on “shipping mules” to receive
and forward the deliveries to foreign locations.

Social networking is an
increasingly important tool
for cybercriminals looking
to spread their cash-out
operations around the globe.

Typically, scammers tell their victims that they cannot
ship items they have purchased online directly to their
home or business address in a foreign country due to
some type of “legal” restriction. They ask the victim’s
permission to send the goods to his or her home, and
offer to handle all of the shipping expenses.
Once the victim agrees to help, he or she quickly
receives a flood of parcels containing the illegally
purchased goods and is asked to repackage and send
them to one or more locations outside the country.
This may go on until the scammer’s specific mission
is complete, or until the victim grows suspicious (or
weary of the reshipping process) or is visited by law
enforcement and informed that the products being
shipped outside the country were paid for with stolen
or fraudulent credit cards.

Mules participating in reshipping fraud may or may
not be willing conspirators. But criminals have been
known to prey on those who are looking for personal
relationships online. They lure victims with overtures
of friendship or romance communicated via email or
instant messages—perhaps even sending nominal gifts
as the “relationship” progresses. Over time, as the victim
becomes convinced he or she has found a new best
friend or a potential soul mate, the criminal begins to
ask for favors.

The Appeal of Automated Clearing House Transactions for Money Mule Operations
An automated clearing house (ACH) transfer takes
more time to complete than a wire transfer (a day or
more, versus minutes), but because the process is
automated, ACH transactions are less expensive. In
addition, larger amounts of cash can be transferred.
And unlike a wire transfer, the identities of the sender
and recipient are not verified, which makes them an
even more attractive tool for criminals.
When an automated clearing house (ACH) transfer
is initiated, all the information is sent in a “batch” to
a clearing house, which then handles the transaction.
When a financial institution attempts to reverse a
transfer—which is not a quick and easy process to
initiate—it is “all or nothing.”
For example, if a fraudulent US$100,000 transfer
is sent via an ACH transaction to a money mule’s
account, when the bank tries to reverse the
US$100,000, if there is less than that amount
in the account (maybe a mule has already
started wiring some of the money overseas), the
reversal fails.

12

Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report

The appropriate thing for the bank to do is to keep
retrying with progressively smaller amounts until it
succeeds in recouping at least a portion of the stolen
money. However, many banks are not sophisticated
enough to do this, and the money is lost.
That’s not always the end of the story, though. More
financial institutions are pursuing money mules after
illegal ACH and wire transfers have been detected
and holding them liable for funds lost. Mules often
use their own bank accounts to help carry out the
fraud, which makes them easy for authorities to
trace. In addition, in the United States, the federal
government is becoming more aggressive about
tracking down and prosecuting mules—as well as
their handlers.

An Offer You Should Refuse
If a money mule recruitment email arrived in your
inbox, would you immediately know it was a scam?
Maybe—especially if the email is poorly written and
tells an outlandish tale. But if you are someone
who is eager to make extra (and supposedly easy)
income, and you have difficulty saying no—particularly
when the person writing to you for help seems so
friendly—then you might be more likely to believe an
offer that sounds too good to be true is on the level.
And you would not be alone.
In an October 2010 blog post for The Huffington
Post, Cisco senior security advisor Christopher
Burgess shared an example of a money mule
solicitation he recently received in his own email
inbox.10 The “work online from home” offer seeking
a U.S.-based representative/online bookkeeper for
a U.K. fabric company indicates that the supposed
employer, Owen Geven, is willing to pay 10 percent
for every payment from a client that is processed
through the representative (who apparently needs
no bookkeeping experience whatsoever to handle
this important job).

Emails like the one below that are used to attract
money mule candidates feature telltale signs that can
help targets recognize a scam is likely afoot. Burgess
outlined several of these warning signs in his recent
blog post11:
• You are told to “keep this offer secret”
• You are asked to “respond to this
offer right now”

• You are informed the company needs
protection from taxes associated with
international sales remittance
• You are asked to spend your money
• You are requested to open or provide
any information associated with your
bank account(s)

In September 2010, spam emails that were purportedly
from business social networking service LinkedIn were
sent worldwide and contained fake reminders. If the
recipient clicked through on any links contained in the
message, their computer became infected with Zeus
data-theft malware, which captures personal banking
information.

Fake LinkedIn Messages as a Percent of Total Spam

Sept 27 10:30

As Cisco has discussed in previous security reports,
users of social networks continue to place high levels
of trust in information they (supposedly) receive from
other members of these networks, or what seem to
be official messages from these networks. Knowing this
weakness, scammers are naturally directing more of
their spam messages at social network users, employing
social engineering tactics to drive necessary clickthroughs
and malware downloads.

steal personal login data.“The LinkedIn spam campaign
strongly suggests that its perpetrators are most
interested in employees with access to financial systems
and online commercial bank accounts. According to
the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaints Center, in 2009,
more than US$100 million was stolen from commercial
bank accounts using methods like this,” explains Nilesh
Bhandari, product manager at Cisco. “The scammers
are targeting the professionals who used LinkedIn,
not people who frequent MySpace or Facebook.
Organizations should encourage people to be suspicious
of any email that purports to be from a legitimate source,
but appears slightly different than they might expect.”

The LinkedIn spam operation is worth noting and
watching in the future because of the high volume of
messages delivered, as well as the fact that supposedly
savvy business users (presumably, higher-value targets)
were targeted and that Zeus malware was used to

Sept 27 10:15

One noticeable shift in social engineering is that
criminals are spending more time figuring out how to
assume someone’s identity, perhaps by generating
emails from an individual’s computer or social
networking account. A malware-laden email or scam
sent by a “trusted person” is more likely to elicit a
clickthrough response than the same message sent
by a stranger. Koobface malware, which first appeared
on Facebook in 2008, uses this tactic, sending
messages to friends of an infected Facebook user and
convincing them to download the malware. (See the
sidebar on page 18 for more about the evolution of the
Koobface botnet.) And in October 2010, a freelance
web developer created Firesheep, an extension for the
Firefox browser that allows someone on an unsecured
wireless network to hijack another wireless user’s
Facebook or Twitter account.12

The scale of this particular spam operation was daunting:
On the day the messages were sent, they numbered
in the billions and accounted for 24 percent of spam
messages worldwide. While this has been the largest
outbreak of social networking-related spam to date, it’s
not the first: The Cutwail botnet, which was first detected
in 2007, routinely sends emails that try to convince
recipients that they originate from social networks.

Percent of Spam

As discussed in the introduction, exploitation of trust is
now an essential tool across all sectors of cybercrime.
Nowhere is this tactic more widespread than within
social networking, where it continues to attract victims
who are willing to share information with people they
believe are known to them.

Day/Time
In September 2010, spam messages lured recipients into clicking on links in fake LinkedIn
notifications that infected their computers with Zeus malware.

Spammers Get Social

How to Educate the “Problem Users”

Spammers are not only spoofing social networking
messages to persuade targets to click on links in emails—
they are taking advantage of users’ trust of their social
networking connections to attract new victims. As
communications shift from traditional email and toward
the messaging features used in social networks, such
as those provided by Facebook and LinkedIn, criminals
follow closely behind.

Since people are the weak point in forming a defense
against socially engineered scams, user education must
be ongoing and effective. However, in spite of many
organizations’ best efforts to teach workers to exercise
caution when responding to emails or social network
messages, social engineering continues to be a highly
successful method for cybercriminals.

One tactic is to lure individuals into “liking” a particular
Facebook page, claiming that the user will see a shocking
photo or read a dramatic news story. Once the user
has clicked on Facebook’s “Like” button for that page,
its creator can now email the user to click on other links
(perhaps to malware), and can also see the user’s
personal information, if they have made it viewable for
other friends. Another tactic is to send out fake friend
requests, which frequently include a picture of an
attractive man or woman. If the recipient decides to
view this supposed person’s Facebook page, they will
usually find only a single post, which links to some
type of scam.

The problem may be that there is a small but significant
group of users for whom safety messages do not
resonate. Clickthrough rates for most malware or
spam incidents consistently hover at around 3 percent,
according to data from Cisco ScanSafe. While
3 percent may not seem high, imagine the impact of
repeated waves of spam to which 3 percent of workers
consistently respond to and click on. Even this small
percentage is the equivalent of having a gaping hole
in the network firewall that cannot be closed. Instead
of trying to change human behavior, security researchers
are exploring the possibility of changing the way we
use software to reduce risks.

For instance, all computer users are conditioned to click
on dialog buttons to initiate certain actions. Scammers
can simply design their schemes so that malware is
delivered, or the user is redirected somewhere else, by
encouraging clicks. “Because of this automatic behavior,
user awareness campaigns based on the idea of not
clicking on suspicious links or downloads don’t have a
lot of impact,” says Gavin Reid, Cisco computer security
incident response team manager. “We can’t fix this
problem with training—we need to fix it with software
that the end user can operate with confidence.”
A tougher solution may be to establish harsher penalties
for workers who consistently ignore directives from IT
about social engineering—for instance, isolating or
“sandboxing” problem users from network access until
they receive remedial training. The hardest-to-reach
users may not fully understand the impact of their actions,
and they may not have compelling reasons to change
their behavior. In addition, organizations need to
measure the efficacy of their education programs—
there’s no point investing time and money in training
that consistently misses the mark.
Also on the horizon are tighter controls on how workers
use social networks like Facebook. Security solutions
that allow businesses to fine-tune how individuals
navigate around a social networking site, and what
information they can post and share, already are on
the market.
In users’ defense, not all of the problems associated
with safe navigation of social networking stem from user
ignorance. Facebook’s frequent changes to its privacy
and security settings can confound even the most expert
social networker, making it challenging to know when
and if one is truly shielding private information.

Scammers trick social network users into “liking” an intriguing Facebook page, allowing the scammers to see user profiles.

Fake Profiles: Enabling Access
to Personal Information
Instead of hacking into private social networking profiles,
why not have your targets willingly show you the
personal information you need? The potential success
of such a strategy was highlighted at the beginning of
2010, when Thomas Ryan, founder of the firm Provide
Security, created fictitious profiles on Facebook,
LinkedIn, and Twitter for a woman named Robin Sage.
Sage was described as woman in her 20s with a degree
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who
analyzed cyberthreats for the U.S. Department of the
Navy. Her profile included a picture of an attractive
young woman as an additional lure. “Robin” quickly
made connections with about 300 people in the U.S.
military, government agencies, security companies, and
government contractors.13 According to DarkReading.com,
the fictitious woman was offered jobs by several firms,
including Lockheed. Some of Sage’s connections said
they determined fairly quickly that the social networking
pages were fakes; on the other hand, Sage’s profiles
continued to rack up high-level connections until
Ryan took them down in January 2010, a month after
creating them.
The lesson of Ryan’s experiment for security experts
and all employees is that within social networks, even
users who think they are exercising caution by locking
up information against people who aren’t members of
their social networks can be put at risk by the careless
acceptance of connection or friend requests.

13

The fake “Robin Sage” Twitter account was intended to attract highly placed officials within government and security.

The old adage, “If it sounds too good to be true, it
probably is,” should be put into play when it comes to
responding to social networking connection requests.
A pretty young woman whose resume sounds a bit
too advanced for her age, and who quickly amasses
hundreds of friends, should raise suspicion—much the
same as a message from a supposed celebrity, or an
alert that you’ve won a prize, should be viewed with
skepticism. In many ways, social network exploits borrow
the same tried-and-true tactics used by scammers
for decades.

The old adage, “If it sounds too
good to be true, it probably is,”
should be put into play when it
comes to responding to social
networking connection requests.

and researchers from the University of

at

The Koobface botnet, which first hit Facebook
and MySpace in July 2008 and convinces
victims to download malware that can steal
credit card data, is a textbook example of
the creativity and ingenuity of cybercriminals.
As methods of detecting and blocking the
Koobface malware were developed, and as
new ways to monetize the botnet were needed,
Koobface’s creators became adept at adapting
their invention to new scenarios. We can
expect similar levels of innovation from today’s
cybercriminals.

“The Koobface operator has been
forced to creatively adapt his botnet
in order to circumvent efforts by the
security community to eliminate it.
By watching Koobface’s evolution, we
can gain insights into the protective
mechanisms that may be the baseline
of future botnet families.”
—Henry Stern, senior security researcher, Cisco

August 2008, spoofs URLs: In the first week after
Koobface launched, the URLs in the messages
delivered to potential victims were modified to appear
innocuous. For instance, the prefix of the URL might
have been changed to begin with www.google.com
to make users think the link led to Google. In
addition, the domains were part of a “Fast Flux”
network, in which domain name system (DNS)
settings are rotated so that the IP address resolving
to the hostname is changed, which complicates
investigations.
September 2008, reroutes traffic: Koobface adds
a new executable, tinyproxy.exe, which allows
Koobface operators to route traffic through their own
nodes instead of another Fast Flux infrastructure.
This meant they removed their dependence on a
third-party infrastructure, saving them money and
giving them more control over their “product.”
December 2008, expands to other sites: Koobface
expands the sites on which it could operate to other
social networks, including Bebo and Friendster. The
list expanded again in March 2009 to include such
sites as LiveJournal, NetLog, and Tagged.com.
March 2009, adds spam as delivery vehicle:
Koobface begins to be delivered via spam campaigns
instead of just social networks.

July 2009, changes DNS servers: Koobface adds
a DNS changer, which changes the victim’s DNS
server to one controlled by the criminal, allowing
them to hijack any hostname they want. For example,
if a victim tried to log in to their online bank account,
they could be redirected to the scammer’s own server.
August 2009, redirects search engine results:
Koobface adds a new way to monetize itself by
adding search engine result redirection on infected
computers. Victims were redirected to various ad
affiliate sites before finally landing on the soughtafter page.
August 2009, adds reputation hijacking: Koobface
avoids “bad reputation” filters by using sites with
a good reputation, such as blogspot.com, as its
advertised destination so that users felt comfortable
clicking on the link. However, these pages were
created by the malware itself.
December 2009, creates fake malware warnings:
Koobface creates a warning about downloading
malware that appeared to originate from Facebook
itself—but the link for the so-called “Facebook
Security Update” executed the Koobface malware.
December 2009, hacks CAPTCHA protections:
Social networking sites add CAPTCHA tests for users
who post URLs. Koobface dodges this protection
by sending the CAPTCHA to other computers that
are part of the botnet, and directing an unsuspecting
user to enter the CAPTCHA information to prevent
their Microsoft Windows operating system from
shutting down.

July 2009, shows up on Twitter: Koobface surfaces
on Twitter, no doubt because the shortened URLs
commonly posted by Twitter users would mask the
offending Koobface URLs.

Social Engineering:
The “Seven Deadly
Weaknesses” That
Criminals Exploit
Like athletes and chess players, cybercriminals are
skilled at identifying their targets’ weak points. Social
engineering offers a host of techniques for preying
on potential victims and their weaknesses, fooling
them into downloading malware or paying for sham
pharmaceuticals or anti-virus programs. Following
are seven weaknesses that workers need to watch if
they want to avoid falling prey to social engineering
scams—whether they take the form of emails, social
networking chats, or phone calls.

“Compassion and urgency are common
social engineering hooks for criminals.
The individual seeking information
will attempt to trigger the target’s
basic human need to be helpful. The
individual will also infuse a sense of
urgency in their quest for information
or specific action, with the expectation
that you won’t have sufficient time to
verify their credentials.”
—Christopher Burgess, senior security advisor, Cisco

1

Sex Appeal

Scammers will try to tempt users into action
by masquerading as an attractive man or
woman, particularly on social networks. People
should assume that a flirtatious advance from
someone they don’t know has a less-romantic
purpose behind it.

2

Greed

As stated in the section on fake Facebook
profiles (page 17), if something is too good to
be true, it probably is. People considering free iPod
offers, or a percentage of a Nigerian wire transfer,
need to resist the urge to make a deal.

3

Vanity

Scammers will try to convince potential victims
that they have been chosen, that they’re
winners, or that they are somehow part of a select
group to be on the receiving end of an exclusive
offer. Users should assume they’re not that special.

4

Trust (implied or transient)

In scams involving implied trust, cybercriminals
attempt to convince individuals that they
represent a high-profile brand and therefore can be
trusted. The recent spam campaign involving fake
Apple iTunes purchase receipts (see page 23) is an
example. With transient trust, scammers pretend to
be a trusted companion of someone who the user
trusts—therefore, the trust relationship extends to the
unknown person. Users should be taught to question
any message or phone call that plays on a trust
relationship.

5

Sloth

Criminals rely on user laziness to ensure that
poorly written messages and shortened URLs
don’t rouse suspicion. For instance, users will often
click on a link in an email that is supposedly from
their bank, instead of calling the bank or visiting the
bank’s website to determine if the email is legitimate.
Or users who receive messages from business
contacts on Facebook or LinkedIn will click on a
link that supposedly offers a video of a Hollywood
starlet—instead of questioning why a colleague would
send such a link.

6

Compassion

In 2009, one of the most successful scams
on Facebook involved criminals hijacking
users’ accounts, then posting status updates claiming
that the account holder was stranded somewhere
and needed money. Many kindhearted people fell
for this ploy. Other similar scams involve requesting
donations to nonexistent nonprofits when a major
disaster occurs, such as the earthquake in Haiti.
Users should maintain a high level of skepticism
toward these types of messages.

7

Urgency

Hand-in-hand with compassionate pleas
are scams that insist on a fast response and
tell the potential victim to “act now” or that “time
is running out.” These requests don’t come only
via email or the web: Workers may receive phone
calls from individuals who claim they need login
information or company files sent to them right
away. Users should double-check any such
request with a colleague, and not feel pressured
to respond immediately.

Risks and Vulnerabilities:
The Most Lucrative Targets
Creative cybercriminals are fine-tuning their exploits to
achieve specific goals or steal from particular targets.
They’re also combining several scam tactics to boost their
chances of success.

The earliest cybercriminals specialized in casting a wide
net to find targets for their schemes. Poorly written
spam messages, sent out by the millions, were aimed
at any and all possible email addresses. Most of these
messages are now caught by spam filters, but a small
fraction of recipients will still click through to download
malware unwittingly or decide to order nonexistent
pharmaceuticals.
While broadly aimed spam still appears to be an effective
tool, cybercriminals are seeing value in fine-tuning their
efforts so that their malware reaches a single high-profile
target or performs a specific function. The newest twist
in “hypertargeting” is malware that is meant to disrupt
industrial systems—such as the Stuxnet network worm,
which exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Windows to infect and attempt to tamper with very
specific industrial systems, such as supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) systems.

While components of Stuxnet date back to 2009, the
worm in its complete form was initially detected in
June 2010. The first known copy of the worm was
discovered in a plant in Germany. A subsequent variant
led to a widespread global outbreak.
The appearance of Stuxnet is sobering for several
reasons, not the least of which is the worm’s potential
to severely disrupt critical infrastructure. Stuxnet seems
to have been designed to deflect remediation and
response actions from security professionals. Operators
believed that a default Siemens password (which had
been made public on the web some years earlier) could
not be corrected by vendors without causing significant
difficulty for customers. The SCADA system operators
may have been laboring under a false sense of security
that since their systems were not connected to the
Internet, they would not be prone to infection.

Stuxnet’s built-in features exploit both technical and
operational trusted relationships—for instance, the
malware used stolen security certificates, fooling
other systems into believing it was a legitimate piece
of programming. Stuxnet has already been studied
extensively, and much has been revealed about its inner
workings—providing a blueprint of sorts for future such
campaigns, and educating criminals on how exactly to
create these exploits themselves.
“Stuxnet showcases the determination, resources, and
dangerous intent of today’s cybercriminals,” reports
Mary Landesman, senior security researcher at Cisco.
“Stuxnet raises the already alarmingly high bar of data
and intellectual property theft to an entirely new level—
sabotage of our critical infrastructure.”

Example of Stuxnet Propagation
The worm connects to a remote website
and receives specific instructions.
Command and Control
Server/Website

Stuxnet spreads to other network-connected machines.
The worm uses peer-to-peer networking to communicate
instructions to any infected machines that don’t have
an Internet connection.
Stuxnet can find its way
into the enterprise via
infected USB drives.

SIMATIC WinCC Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System

Stuxnet is deliberately designed to spread to nonnetworked computers in order to eventually infect
Step 7 project files. These files are used to program
the PLC, which controls critical industrial processes.

an industrial control facility.

Advanced Persistent Threats
Take Targeted Approach
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have also adopted
the hypertargeting approach. Over the past several
months, the definition of an APT has shifted, particularly
since the term has become a catchall definition for any
kind of serious cybercriminal threat.
In the Cisco 2010 Midyear Security Report, APTs were
defined as attempts to infiltrate networks via a “lowand-slow” approach—that is, threats that lurk within a
network and remain undetected so that they could steal
information over an extended period of time. This year,
“APTs are more accurately defined as a threat that is
highly targeted toward specific individuals or with a
dedicated mission in mind,” clarifies Rod Bachelor, senior
product manager at Cisco. “Those who create APTs are
going after people based on their access to information,
such as intellectual property, that can be monetized.
These targeted attacks often use the same software
used in conventional attacks, which can make them
harder to distinguish.”
APTs are using social engineering to get a foot in the
door of networks—like all other areas of cybercrime,
APT creators are exploiting trust to lure users into
downloading malware payloads. For instance, an APT
operator might leverage LinkedIn to locate names of
relevant staff at a targeted organization—likely people
who have access to administrative passwords. The
APT operator then crafts a message to these targets,
designed to persuade them to follow a link to malware.
This socially engineered approach can offer an easier
entry path than exploiting network vulnerabilities.

22

The methods for detecting and thwarting APTs remain
the same as those discussed in the Cisco 2010
Midyear Security Report: multilevel defenses that
involve reputation scoring, consistent patching against
vulnerabilities, and ongoing examination of outbound
traffic. These defenses also include educating users
on the specific threats or malware being aimed at
the organization or industry, educating users on how
to navigate the Internet safely, protecting critical and
confidential data, only providing “need to know” access
to information and data, and, in general, preventing and
fending off social engineering campaigns (see “Seven
Deadly Weaknesses,” page 19).

• Evasive: The most reliable detection for Java exploits
is to run the exploits on a virtual machine, and then
monitor the systems for security violations—however,
this approach is prohibitively resource-intensive
for most organizations. Enterprises need security
solutions that can intercept and detect exploits on
any device, regardless of whether they are on the
network (such as mobile devices using Java).

Organizations that are familiar with APTs often baseline
legitimate business traffic to more easily identify traffic
that is malicious—or at least different from legitimate
traffic. Correlating alerts and log messages from network
and security devices may help as well.

• Invasive: Multiplatform interoperability is a hallmark
of Java. While this is largely a benefit, it also makes it
easy to distribute malware across several platforms,
as well as any devices that run Java.

Java and PDFs: Widely in Use,
Heavily Exploited
Cybercriminals aim their campaigns at software programs,
devices, and operating systems where they can reach
the widest net of potential victims, as demonstrated by
the noticeable increase in exploits involving the Java
programming language—and the ongoing use of PDF
documents to launch exploits. At this point, Java appears
to be the greater threat.
The flaws in Java have made it a promising target
for criminals—for instance, the Blackhole, Crimepack,
and Eleonore exploit software packages, which are
created by and sold to other criminals, make heavy
use of Java.15 The latest exploits based on Java have
certain characteristics that make them worrisome from
a security standpoint. These exploits are:

• Pervasive: Java works in the background; for the
most part, users are not aware that it is running or
whether they’ve updated it recently. Therefore, it’s not
difficult for scammers to configure malware to check
for older versions of Java during exploits.

When it comes to PDFs, organizations rely heavily on
these documents to conduct business, so the idea of
limiting their use within corporate networks is seen as
impossible. Yet Adobe Reader and Acrobat continue
to be strong threat vectors online, even though such
exploits are on the decline. It’s the rare business or
personal computer that doesn’t have the Adobe Reader
software for viewing PDFs, and computer users continue
to place an undue amount of trust in these documents.
In September 2010, security researchers detected a
zero-day exploit in which PDF documents were used
to deliver a malicious file with a valid (but stolen)
VeriSign signature for a credit union. The valid signature
allowed the exploit to bypass two important defenses
in the Microsoft Windows operating system.16 The
infected PDFs were delivered in emails touting advice
from prominent golfing coach David Leadbetter, and they
prompted the recipient to open the PDF for more golf tips.

Once again, trust exploitation was at work, with a
message aimed at golf-friendly executives who would
presumably be eager to improve their game. The use
of a stolen digital certificate was also designed to fool
networks into trusting that the file was safe. In addition,
it appeared that the Leadbetter emails were aimed at
major corporations, so the infected PDF’s creators may
have been targeting high-profile individuals.
Until Adobe Acrobat and Reader become less vulnerable
to such exploits, IT departments can either raise
awareness among users about downloading PDFs from
unknown senders, or take steps to block PDF downloads
completely within their networks. If a blanket block of
PDFs is not possible, network administrators can choose
to disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat,
and not allow PDFs to be launched automatically via the
web. Security researchers are reacting in many ways
to the prolific rise in PDF threats, even going as far as
suggesting an alternative to PDFs.

Criminals Favoring Java Over PDFs
Online criminals pay close attention to the success and
failure rates of their exploits. As of late 2010, it became
clear that they feel Java is a gold mine. In January 2010,
Java exploits made up 1.5 percent of web malware
blocked by Cisco ScanSafe. By November 2010, such
exploits skyrocketed to 7 percent. Conversely, PDF
exploits are on the decline: In January, PDF exploits
totaled slightly more than 6 percent of web malware
blocked by Cisco ScanSafe; by November, that number
had dropped to just 2 percent.
Why is Java favored over PDFs as an exploit launching
pad? Possible reasons are the increased availability of
public Java exploit code and the decreased availability
of public Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat exploits. In
addition, users have begun shifting toward alternative
PDF readers, and users who still favor Adobe PDF
solutions are more likely to disable JavaScript and Flash.
For these reasons, PDF exploits have not succeeded
as often. Furthering the rush to Java was the fact that
in April 2010, public exploit code for Java was released
and quickly adopted.

Combining several tactics can yield greater
results than simply deploying a single scam. An
October 2010 spam outbreak, featuring fake
iTunes purchase receipts and custom-crafted
links, was a notable example of this strategy.
In this outbreak, individuals received emails with
a fictitious receipt for a purchase on the iTunes
music and media service. The supposed invoice
was blank, and contained the text, “Click here if
you not see image” (sic). Recipients who clicked
on the link were asked to download a fake
PDF reader, and then redirected to an infected
webpage that contained the Zeus malware,
which steals banking data.
The creators of this scam used several tactics:
• They used familiar consumer brands—in this
case, Apple iTunes—to lure victims into
clicking on links.
• They compromised thousands of legitimate
websites so that users would think they
had reached a legitimate site, not one that
would deliver malware.

In mid-2010, in response to the growing use of PDFs
as launching pads for threats, Adobe announced that it
would include a security improvement in the next major
release of Adobe Reader. When the

New on the horizon are exploits delivered via
social networking that can infiltrate multiple

detected malware called Java/Boonana, which
is sent to Facebook users and is downloaded
by unsuspecting users via a link to a supposed
video. The malware is written in Java, and can
infect computers using Microsoft Windows,
Apple, or Linux operating systems.18

Building Better Security
Into Passwords
In spite of pleading from IT professionals to choose
tough-to-guess security passwords, workers are
still disconcertingly likely to come up with something
like “password1!”—or simply attach a few numbers,
like “123,” to the end of a word. The problem of
weak, guessable passwords is not a new one, but it
isn’t going away—in fact, it’s getting worse, as users
are forced to create several passwords for different
systems and change them every 60 or 90 days.
No wonder users default to using the least
complicated password that their systems allow, and
make only minor variations when forced to change
them. Unfortunately, such passwords are easy to
guess. At the other end of the scale are passwords
that are randomly generated by the software solutions
themselves, which are difficult for users to remember.
In a recent paper coauthored by Cisco, Florida State
University, and Redjack LLC, researchers examined
how different password requirements affected
password strength—such as requiring the use of a
minimal password length or the addition of a special
character such as an exclamation point. As the
researchers discovered, such policies usually don’t
provide greater security, since hackers are well-versed
in these tactics and can use them to guess passwords
and access accounts. For instance, hackers know
that when users are required to use a special
character in a password, they will usually simply
append that character to the end of the password.

24

Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report

A better practice, say the researchers, is an external
password creation policy that changes a password
after it is created to add a guaranteed amount of
randomness—for example, adding two random
digits to the end of a password. This allows users to
choose a password that they are likely to remember,
while making it difficult to guess. Another tactic is an
implicit password policy, which will reject a password
instantly based on its estimated strength, and suggest
a stronger one. In addition, administrators should
implement available password protection software,
which means users only need to remember one
strong master password, since the application stores
encrypted passwords that the user saves.

The problem of weak,
guessable passwords is
not a new one, but it isn’t
going away—in fact, it’s
getting worse.

The Vulnerability and Threat Categories chart above
demonstrates a sizable shift from buffer overflows to
arbitrary code executions between 2009 and 2010.
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities have likely declined
due to the identification of such vulnerabilities in
previous years, as well as improvements in coding
practices. However, the rise of arbitrary code
execution vulnerabilities and threats indicates an
increase in criminals’ exploit capabilities—that is, the
use of automated tools to find the vulnerabilities as
well as the tools criminals use to exploit these
vulnerabilities.
In 2010, there was also a notable increase in
information disclosure vulnerabilities and threats.
Most other categories showed decreases in 2010,
including denial of service, cross-site scripting,
software faults, and format strings. Trojans and
worms continue to show low numbers, reflecting
the lack of new exploits in this category.

Severity ≥5

The Cisco IntelliShield Alert Severity Ratings
reflect the impact level of successful vulnerability
exploits. For 2010, severity levels remained relatively
consistent with those in 2009 and 2008, although
the shift to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities
is reflected in the increase in Severity 4 (moderate
damage) ratings. The decrease in Severity 3 (mild
damage) ratings reflects the decrease in buffer
overflows and denial of service vulnerabilities.
It is notable that the shift in vulnerability and severity
ratings reflects an increased level of criminal control
on targeted systems. While the buffer overflow and
denial of service vulnerabilities of previous years
primarily reflected a system availability concern, the
arbitrary code execution and information disclosure
vulnerabilities of 2010 have a higher-risk impact to
both system confidentiality and integrity.

Urgency ≥3

Urgency ≥4

Urgency ≥5

Cisco IntelliShield Alert Urgency Ratings
reflect the level of threat activity related to specific
vulnerabilities. After increases in 2008 and 2009,
urgency levels in 2010 decreased. This trend
reflects both the repetitive widespread exploitation
of individual vulnerabilities across a large user base
(such as Adobe and Java vulnerabilities), and the
continued shift toward social engineering methods
that rely on exploitation of the user—not exploitation
of a software vulnerability.*
* The metrics in these charts are based on Cisco Security IntelliShield
Alert Manager year-over-year alert production statistics and do not
necessarily reflect or conflict with metrics of other sources that may show
increased or decreased levels of vulnerability and threat activity. To reduce
time and increase productivity for customers, IntelliShield provides a first
level of threat filtering and does not alert customers to vulnerabilities and
threats that are not likely to impact business and government environments.
Other vulnerability and reporting sources may have different reporting
criteria and vary from these metrics. Cisco IntelliShield bases reporting on
individual vulnerabilities or threats. For example, variations of the Koobface
worm are reported in a single alert and regarded as one threat. That
single alert and threat is updated with the latest information and variants
and republished, not reported or counted as a separate threat.

Worldwide Government Trends
As governments become more focused on improving cybersecurity
and developing global standards, private industry is stepping up to
help ensure legislation does not stifle innovation.

United States Government Update
2010 saw a continued focus on cybersecurity
legislation, with increasing momentum toward
creating a comprehensive bill that would cover law
enforcement, critical infrastructure protection, research
and development, and global norms for cybersecurity.
Growing concerns about foreign entities hacking into
networks to gather intelligence, the safety of national
infrastructure in light of the Stuxnet threat (see page 21),
the effects on the competitive edge of the United States
due to theft by domestic and international cybercriminals
of intellectual property from businesses, and a focus
on ensuring supply chain integrity for software and
hardware are just some of the key factors behind the
recent push by U.S. lawmakers for more substantial
cybersecurity legislation.
However, while obviously well-intended, several
new legislative proposals now being considered by
the U.S. Congress could be potentially intrusive on
private industry. For example, there is some concern
in the private sector that the U.S. government, with its
substantial procurement power, may become more
involved in the development of IT products. Many
companies worry this may stifle their innovation—and
perhaps, could undermine efforts to develop more
secure technology products.
There also is concern within private industry that new
regulatory demands that may evolve from proposed
cybersecurity legislation could prevent enterprises
from responding effectively to emerging and changing
threats. Leading companies—including Cisco—have
been engaged in ongoing dialogue with the federal
government, and are advising lawmakers on how to
avoid the creation of legislation that might adversely
affect the security of networks and private industry’s
innovation.

Getting the Word Out on Cybersecurity:
Private-Public Partnership
Stop. Think. Connect.™ was
the tagline for the National
Cyber Security Alliance’s public
awareness campaign launched
in October 2010 in partnership
with the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security, the Federal Trade Commission,
and others.19 The campaign was designed to “guide
the nation to a higher level of Internet safety” by
challenging the American public to be more vigilant
about practicing good “cyber hygiene” and to view
Internet safety as a “shared responsibility.”
The effort included a music video—created by
EMC Corp. and RSA—used to inform young people
about the potential dangers of the Internet. Posted
on YouTube, the video features Jay Wise and
Friends (Wise is an eighth grade social studies
teacher and director of performing arts in Roxbury,
Massachusetts). The song lyrics included “stay
safe” messages such as, “Don’t talk to strangers,
even on the web.”

Messaging Convention, organized by the National
Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), the Anti-Phishing
Working Group (APWG), several government
agencies, nonprofits, and members of private
industry. This was the seventh annual National
Cyber Security Awareness Month initiative.

Young Internet users are encouraged to “Stop. Think.
Connect.” in an online music video featuring Jay Wise and
Friends. The effort was part of a recent U.S. public service
campaign about cybersecurity.

The “Stop. Think. Connect.” public awareness
campaign is the result of a yearlong, collaborative
effort by the Online Consumer Security and Safety

www.staysafeonline.org: Founded in 2001, NCSA’s mission is to educate and therefore empower a digital society to use the Internet safely and securely at home, work, and school, protecting the technology individuals’ use,
the networks they connect to, and our shared digital assets.

Another notable cybersecurity development for the U.S.
government in 2010: The Obama administration, which
has made strengthening national cybersecurity one
of its top priorities, reached a significant milestone on
November 3 when the new U.S. Cyber Command (also
known as “CYBERCOM”) finally reached full operating
status after several delays. Led by four-star Army
General Keith B. Alexander, CYBERCOM works side-byside with the National Security Agency (NSA) and has
the authority to defend the nation’s military networks.

European Union Update
ENISA, the European Network and Information Security
Agency, has been actively working with European
Commission ministers and departments and European
Union (EU) Member States on policy and operational
issues around cybersecurity. Through these discussions,
private-public partnerships have emerged as the
most promising approach for tackling such issues as
information sharing, cross-country collaboration, cloud
computing, and identity management.
ENISA is also heading EP3R, the European Public Private
Partnership for Resilience. EP3R is the flexible Europewide governance framework for resilience of information
and communication technology infrastructure, which
works to foster cooperation between the public and
private sectors on security and resilience objectives,
baseline requirements, policy practices, and measures.

Geopolitical Trends:
Cooperate or Separate?
The ongoing process of developing and refining global
standards for security and information technology has
come up against the desire of some governments to
create domestic standards around IT solutions that can
be deployed within their borders. In fact, this struggle
to maintain global standards versus instances of nonstandard domestic requirements surpasses hardware
and software, and can affect network architecture and
business processes as well.
Information technology networks are based on global
standards that help ensure interoperability and security.
In security, these goals are achieved by international
standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) and the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE); for product assurance,
these goals are achieved by the Common Criteria, an
International Organization for Standardization standard
and the subject of a multilateral agreement among 26
nations, known as the Common Criteria Recognition
Arrangement.

In the EU, private-public
partnerships have emerged as
the most promising approach
to tackling many policy and
operational issues around
cybersecurity.

2010 saw a number of countries attempt to use
nonstandard domestic requirements for product
assurance, along with a corresponding reaction by
a majority of countries to return to the primacy of
international standards such as the Common Criteria.
Cisco and other companies are leading an effort to
embrace, reform, and extend the Common Criteria in
order to drive the benefits of increased security, and
extend the benefits of global innovation in products
and systems.
An example of the complexities of these collaborative
security efforts is the ongoing debate, led primarily
within the EU but taking place in many countries, on
protecting personal data in cross-border computing
systems. Countries recognize that the interests and
concerns of their own citizens must be raised if they are
to be recognized in regulations that affect cross-border
transactions—although these differing standards can
affect the development of technologies that are meant
to be in use globally.
EU privacy laws limit the transfer of personal data
outside the EU’s borders and arguably has restricted
the growth of cloud computing in Europe. In response,
organizations with a major stake in the cloud computing
market are working on ways to adjust to different laws
and values as data moves beyond borders.20

Global Spam Update: Spam Down Globally, but on the Rise in Europe
In the global spam update in the Cisco 2009 Annual
Security Report, emerging economies showed the
sharpest increases in spam production. In 2010,
the problem spots were developed nations, with
France, Germany, and the United Kingdom displaying
markedly higher rates of spam volume. In the United
Kingdom, for example, spam volume rose almost
99 percent from 2009 to 2010, according to Cisco
research. One likely reason for this spam growth is
the spread of broadband Internet in these countries.
As in other developed nations, the faster the Internet
pipeline, the easier it is to launch botnet-driven
spam campaigns.
In spite of these increases, it’s important to note that
global annual spam volumes actually dropped—the
first time this has happened in the history of the
Internet. The reason is that some key players in the
spam world were halted by security researchers,
resulting in a marked decline in spam.
The good news is that Brazil, China, and Turkey—all of
which figured high on last year’s list of spam nations—
showed significantly lower volumes of spam in 2010.
In particular, Turkey’s spam volume dropped 87
percent from 2009 to 2010. Service providers in
China and Turkey have made concentrated efforts to
eradicate the botnets that produce spam by working
closely with their customers. Brazil’s spam volume
has been in decline since Internet service providers
began restricting access to port 25, which is used
by spammers for relaying email.
Governments seem to place greater importance
on taking a leadership role in fighting spam, and
are setting aside resources for anti-spam efforts.

21

In Germany, for example, where spam volume
increased 10 percent in 2010, a new Anti-Botnet
Initiative has been funded by the country’s Ministry
of the Interior, with funds intended to help consumers
clean up computers that have been infected by
botnets.
Five German Internet service providers are
participating in the program, and will identify infected
computers on their networks and notify owners,
who are then eligible for free malware-removal
assistance.21

Global annual spam volumes
actually dropped in 2010–the
first time this has happened
in the history of the Internet.

The Tipping Point: Cybercriminals
Targeting Mobile Platforms
PC vendors are building better security in their products, making them
much harder to exploit. Cybercriminals are responding by shifting
their focus to the ever-expanding legion of mobile users.

While it’s only beginning to percolate, a trend is clearly
emerging: Cybercriminals, looking for new opportunities
outside of the PC environment, are investing more
resources toward developing exploits that specifically
target users of mobile devices. Most notably, perhaps,
was the emergence of SymbOS/Zitmo.Altr in late
2009 (see page 7), which represented the first known
appearance of mobile malware featuring the powerful
and pervasive banking Trojan, Zeus.
Taking advantage of the rapidly multiplying number of
mobile users worldwide makes business sense. Lessdeveloped nations are particularly ripe for opportunity:
According to the United Nation’s telecommunications
agency, the International Telecommunications Union

22

(ITU), even though high-speed Internet is still out
of reach for many citizens of poorer nations, mobile
telephony is filling the void because it is available
and affordable. The ITU estimates that by the end of
2010, of the more than 5 billion mobile subscriptions
worldwide, 3.8 billion will be in the developing world.
And by late 2010, ITU predicted mobile penetration
in developing countries would reach 68 percent.22
This shift in focus toward mobile users is being spurred
for another reason: A significant “tipping point” in
vulnerabilities has been reached. PC vendors are
building better security into their products, and they are
moving faster than ever to provide updates, alert users
to potential flaws, and make patches available to users.

This means it is becoming increasingly time-consuming
and resource-intensive to find ways to exploit platforms
that once were so lucrative—in particular, the Microsoft
Windows platform. “For a long time, cybercriminals have
found many opportunities to take advantage of users
through the Windows PC,” notes Patrick Peterson, senior
security researcher and Cisco Fellow. “It was easy, so
why go anywhere else? But now, the Windows operating
system is in much better shape—and criminals are
getting hungry.”

Cybercriminals’ shift in focus
toward mobile users and away
from the PC environment
is being spurred partly by a
significant “tipping point” in
vulnerabilities.

“ITU estimates two billion people online by end [of] 2010,” International Telecommunications Union, media release, October 19, 2010, www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2010/39.aspx#url.

Peterson likens cybercriminals to bears who have been
“feasting on Windows boxes for a long time.” He adds,
“The Windows platform was the ‘slowest hiker’ in the
woods. But now, it’s getting harder for the bears to
catch, so other platforms are in more danger. Apple’s
iOS and Mac OS and the Google Android OS are hikers
that the bears have largely ignored, but now, these
platforms are looking much tastier.” Peterson concludes,
“Just keep in mind, if you are a vendor facing the threat
of bears, to survive you don’t have to be faster than
the bears—just faster than the slowest hiker.”

Android and Apple Operating Systems
Likely Key Targets in 2011
The “bears” may be changing their hunting patterns, but
cybercriminals are still very much in the research and
development phase with their methods of snaring victims
using mobile devices. Over the past two years, there
have been a number of phishing scams, mostly regional
in focus, targeting individuals or select groups—such as
customers of local banks or credit unions. And Apple’s
products, including iPhones, iPads, and the iTunes media
service, have all been recent targets (for more on Apple
vulnerabilities, see sidebar “Recent Spike in Exploits
Targeting Apple Users” on page 33).
As for the Apple iPhone, users of the newly released
iOS 4 have benefitted from more than 60 patches
designed to fix security vulnerabilities, including an
exploit that allowed third-party applications (“apps”) to
access information on an iPhone user’s location without
permission. However, many users are undermining
the security of their smartphones and other devices,
including iPads and iTouch devices, by “jailbreaking”
them. Discussed in previous Cisco security reports,
jailbreaking is a process that allows users to unlock the
iOS, thereby removing Apple-imposed limitations on
what apps they can download and from where.

For a long time, the Microsoft Windows platform was easy game
as the “slowest hiker.” But now that it is more secure and harder to
exploit, other platforms, like Apple’s Mac operating system and the
Google Android operating system, are in greater danger of being
targeted by cybercriminals (the “bears”).

In July 2010, the U.S. Library of Congress added
jailbreaking to its list of actions that do not violate
copyright protections—leaving iPhone users free to
unlock their devices and download applications not
authorized by Apple. Only a week after the ruling,
JailbreakMe 2.0, the one-click, mobile, Safari-based
iPhone jailbreak utility, was unveiled. The new tool makes
it easier than ever for users to jailbreak their phones; in
the past, some advanced technical skill was required.
The advent of this tool also revealed a significant security
flaw in the iOS 4 (which Apple has since patched) that
could leave iPhone users with jailbroken phones more
susceptible to hackers who could gain access to root
privileges and essentially take control of the devices.

Since the Library of Congress lifted the threat of legal
liability from Apple customers looking to unlock their
devices, more than a million users have jailbroken their
iPhones, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
a San Francisco-based privacy rights organization
that petitioned the library. And users are finding ample
opportunity to download unofficial iPhone apps, including
those from a market called Cydia, which provides access
to “Installous” from Hackulous, an app that offers free,
pirated versions of thousands of apps available through
the iTunes store.
Meanwhile, many users are avoiding the hassle of
jailbreaking their iPhones and instead are fully embracing
the open architecture of the Google Android smartphone
operating system. In fact, market share for the Android
OS expanded significantly during 2010, and the opensource operating system is proving to be a significant,
competitive threat to the Apple iPhone (both operating
systems are still trailing Research in Motion’s BlackBerry
OS, however, in terms of popularity by numbers).23
“Three years ago, there was no Android. Now, there
are only a few major handset manufacturers that aren’t
developing devices based on Android,” says Cisco threat
research manager Scott Olechowski. “The growth of this
platform will be exponential. From smartphones and
tablet PCs to cars and refrigerators, we will see billions
of devices, including a massive number in the enterprise,
relying on this platform within the next few years. The
relative youth of the Android OS, including its apps and
ecosystem, combined with the sheer number of users
will make this a very attractive platform for exploitation.”

Recent Spike in Exploits Targeting Apple Users
A few years ago, Apple and its operating system
and products were viewed as somewhat impervious
to criminal hacks—at least, less vulnerable than
Microsoft Windows and other PC systems. That
picture is changing: Over the past five years, Apple
has released a growing number of security updates
in response to the vulnerabilities detected in its
products. According to data from Cisco IntelliShield,
while reported vulnerabilities and updates are on the
rise from most major vendors, Apple is showing the
greatest increase. “As with most large vendors with
a broad product base and many new product and
software releases, you’d expect to see a related
increase in vulnerabilities,” explains Jeff Shipley,
Security Research and Operations manager at
Cisco. “In Apple’s case, the difference is that its
products are being rapidly adopted by a growing

user base, providing an attractive pool of potential
targets.” In other words, Apple has reached the
“tipping point” at which scammers see potential in
shifting their exploits to a new venue.
To its credit, Apple has taken substantial steps
(beyond those of many other vendors) to protect
its technologies against exploits—for instance,
creating a tightly controlled application store that
limits malicious application postings, developing
proprietary controls to limit user environments,
and making Java installations more secure. At the
same time, users have done their best to bypass
these safeguards, “jailbreaking” their products so
they can be used with non-Apple applications and
unapproved service providers.

Adapting to an
Open-Source World
The Android OS is based on a modified version of
the Linux Kernel, which is at the core of a growing
range of products and platforms that includes
mobile devices, readers and tablets, PCs, and many
other products, platforms, and systems. When the
Linux Kernel and other open-source software are
modified or ported for a specific platform or system,
dependency for patches and updates shifts to the
new development structure, which may include
inputs from the public. Management of open-source
software is a challenge for many organizations and
users, requiring them to understand new bug-tracking
processes, release cycles, and open-source licensing.
This added complexity can result in unknown and
unpatched vulnerabilities that are hidden in assets,
disconnected support channels, and extended
vulnerability windows. Users potentially could be
left exposed while waiting for patches and updates
from their vendors, especially if there is an excessive
delay in their release. However, the good news is
that most open-source development managers
are quite responsive to inputs, which are provided
more frequently and from many more sources than
commercial update processes.

“The Apps” of Criminals’ Eyes

Slow Emergence: Cybersecurity
Strategy for the Mobile Enterprise

The mobile applications marketplace is a way for
cybercriminals to reach millions of users worldwide
quickly. According to recent data from market research
firm comScore, smartphones—while representing only
about 25 percent of the total U.S. wireless subscriber
market—accounted for 60 percent of app downloads
and nearly 56 percent of mobile browser access for a
three-month period ending August 2010, up from 43.6
percent and 41.4 percent, respectively, over the same
period in 2009.24 And according to a recent Pew Internet
study, the average U.S. adult has 18 apps on his or
her smartphone—and 20 percent of cell phone users
under the age of 30 download apps frequently.

Businesses are becoming more receptive—partly by
choice, partly by necessity—to mobile working and
less resistant to the consumerization of IT. In fact, the
recent financial crisis has motivated cash-strapped
organizations to allow employees to purchase the mobile
devices they prefer, simply because it is more costeffective for the organization. Other leading companies
have taken the position that mobile devices are part
of modern employees’ basic “uniform” for work, and
therefore expect them to purchase their own devices.
IT security professionals are hopeful that, as they allow
more types of mobile devices into the organization, more
mobile device manufacturers will prioritize many of the
same business-friendly security features that have
made Research in Motion’s BlackBerry devices popular
with enterprises, such as PIN locking, data deletion, and
camera control enabled through remote enforcement.

Weather, mapping, social networking, search, and
news apps are among the types of mobile apps most
frequently downloaded by adults. But game apps,
according to the Nielsen App Playbook, are most
popular: 60 percent of adult users (those over the age
of 18) have used a game app in the past 60 days.
Unfortunately, cybercriminals channeling more energy
into the mobile market have already honed in on taking
advantage of younger users. This is not surprising,
though, considering the statistics: Mediamark Research
and Intelligence reports that the number of children
using cell phones has doubled since 2005. Today, one
in five children in the United States between the ages
of 6 and 11 carries a cell phone. And what do they like
to do with Internet-enabled mobile devices? Browse
the web and download games.
One notable example of an exploit aimed at compromising
younger mobile device users came to light in mid-2010.
It was discovered that free wallpaper apps uploaded to
the Android Market, featuring themes popular with children
such as Star Wars and My Little Pony, were collecting
unnecessary information from subscribers such as

mobile device phone numbers and subscriber identifier
and currently programmed voicemail numbers (but
not voicemail passwords or SIM card numbers). The
information was sent to a site—www.imnet.us—owned by
someone in Shenzen, China. The app was downloaded
millions of times before the surreptitious data-collecting
activity was discovered.
“Third-party mobile apps are emerging as a serious
threat vector. And right now, that market is like the Wild
West,” warns Horacio Zambrano, product line manager
for Cisco. “No one is looking at these apps and
determining what is a ‘good app’ or a ‘bad app.’”

Some organizations are also beginning to recognize
that they should assign the responsibility of mobile
management and security to a dedicated specialist or
team. But many businesses currently lack the resources
to establish a fully fledged function, and the IT personnel
already responsible for mobility issues—such as managing
policies for the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) or
enabling iPhones for a select group of executives—do
not have the time to take on full ownership of the
mobility issue.
“In the classic enterprise organization today, no one
truly owns—or wants to own—the mobility issue,” says
Tom Gillis, vice president and general manager of
the Security Technology Business Unit at Cisco.
“This is actually part of the reason that the adoption
of consumer-driven smartphones in the enterprise has
been slow. When it comes to enabling these devices
and making sure they are secure, no one is stepping up.”

Mobility and Virtualization Trends Contributing to Renewed Focus
on Data Loss Prevention
Rigorous compliance demands, high-profile incidents
of data loss, and the potential security risks due to an
expanding mobile workforce and growing number of
mobile devices in use in the enterprise have brought
about a renewed focus on data loss prevention (DLP)
at many businesses in 2010.

As for the security benefits: If data is not resident on
end devices, it is not as easy for criminals who steal
employees’ equipment to access sensitive enterprise
data, such as financial information and intellectual
property. Cloud-based data also offers availability
in case of a business disruption.

More enterprises are placing greater emphasis on
protecting their data assets as part of a proactive,
overall cybersecurity strategy. They recognize that
today’s malware is designed to steal information—and
their information assets must be protected, as they
are critical to business.

The bottom line is that virtualization and mobility,
while presenting some obvious cybersecurity
concerns for the enterprise, also represent a

tremendous boon to forward-thinking organizations
who embrace them and adapt their security policies
appropriately to support these new ways of working.
The Cisco 2010 Midyear Security Report outlines
recommendations from Cisco security experts for
creating a formal corporate policy for mobility and
an action plan for adopting cloud computing that
can help enterprises to protect their employees
and information.

As the economy improves, more organizations are
assessing the state of their enterprise security and
investing in improvements such as DLP systems.
Vendors are making it easier for them too; today,
there are more solutions that are easier and more
cost-efficient to deploy than ever before. One trend
to watch, particularly in the healthcare and financial
sectors, is the “containerization” of corporate data.
More enterprises likely will explore the option of using
digital certificates in an effort to “containerize” mobile
users and prevent data loss in the event a mobile
device is lost or stolen.
Enterprises are also focusing more attention on DLP
because of the virtualization trend. More organizations
are accessing hosted services through the cloud that
otherwise might be too expensive to purchase or
difficult to implement. But virtualization presents both
risks and benefits from a cybersecurity perspective.
When data is moving from the network, to hosted
services providers, to devices such as employees’
smartphones and laptops, and then back to the
network, how is it being protected?

The Cisco Global ARMS Race Index
The level of compromised resources worldwide has decreased slightly
since 2009—a positive sign. But what lies ahead for 2011? It would seem
the only major hurdle to cybercriminals’ success is their ongoing struggle
to profit fully from their exploits.

The annual Cisco Global ARMS Race Index, inspired
by the Richter Scale used to measure earthquake
magnitude, tracks “Adversary Resource Market Share”
(ARMS). The index provides a way to measure the
overall level of compromised resources worldwide—the
networks and machines currently under “adversarial
control.” Cisco security experts created the index as
a way to gain a better understanding of overall trends
based on the global online criminal community’s
activities and their rates of success at compromising
both enterprise and individual users.
According to data collected for this year’s index,
the aggregate number that represents the level of
compromised resources at the end of 2010 is 6.8,
down from the December 2009 level of 7.2, which was
reported in the Cisco 2009 Annual Report. This means
enterprise networks are still experiencing persistent
infections, while consumer systems continue to be
infected at levels capable of producing consistent and
alarming rates of service abuse; however, the
trend shows that infections of enterprise networks and
consumer systems are less frequent compared to
12 months ago.
To arrive at this year’s measurement on the 10-point
index, Cisco relied on leading botnet-tracking estimates
of total bots and other data points derived through
internal research and other expert sources, such as The
Shadowserver Foundation, which tracks cybercriminal
activity and is comprised of volunteer security
professionals from around the world. The methodology
for the Global ARMS Race Index is based on:
• Current aggregate botnet size
• Statistics used to estimate the total number of
Internet-connected systems in the world
• Estimates on home and work infection rates, which
measure factors like resource availability (such as
bandwidth and computing power)

25

• The high-profile takedowns of botnets such as
Waledac, Mariposa (reportedly, the largest botnet
ever), and Cutwail have had an impact on the reduced
Cisco Global ARMS Race Index number for 2010.
(To read more about recent botnet disruption, see
the Cisco 2010 Cybercrime Showcase, page 4.)
According to data collected for the index, the average
botnet size is one-third smaller compared to 12
months ago. However, this doesn’t mean that
botnets are weakening threats; in fact, they may be
strengthening. “For cybercriminals, how many botnets
you have in operation, and their size, are no longer
important,” emphasizes Seth Hanford, Intelligence
Operations team lead at Cisco. “It’s what you can
do with them.”
In addition, global spam levels have declined overall,
even though there has been an uptick in spam in
developed economies where broadband Internet is
spreading (see Global Spam Update: Spam Down
Globally, but on the Rise in Europe, page 29). Authorities
worldwide are taking the spam problem more seriously,
as well, and have been successful at taking down some
egregious offenders.
One example: In October 2010, Russian authorities
launched their first criminal investigation against a man
they believe is responsible for spreading 20 percent
of the world’s spam—primarily spam featuring offers
for extremely low-priced prescription drugs (mostly
for male enhancement) from unlicensed distributor,
Canadian Pharmacy.25 The alleged spammer, Igor Gusev,
operated SpamIt.com, which provided website design
and order fulfillment services for spammers. When the
site stopped operating in late September 2010, global
spam volume was reduced by more than 60 billion
messages per day, according to Cisco research. As of
January 2011, Gusev was still on the run and believed
to be outside Russia, but Russian authorities are working
with Interpol to locate him.

According to the Cisco Global ARMS Race Index, the level of
resources under adversarial control worldwide was 6.8 at the
end of 2010. This is a decline from the 2009 level of 7.2,
showing that infections of enterprise networks and consumer
systems are less frequent compared to 12 months ago.

Also contributing to the lower level of compromised
resources worldwide is the “tipping point” in
vulnerabilities, discussed in detail earlier in this report
(see The Tipping Point: Cybercriminals Targeting
Mobile Platforms, page 30). PC vendors are building
better security into their products and are issuing
alerts and patches at unprecedented speed. Wanting
to use their time and resources wisely, many criminals
are abandoning their efforts to take advantage of
weaknesses in the Microsoft Windows platform and
are focusing more attention on mobile platforms such
as the Apple iOS and Android OS. Other miscreants,
meanwhile, are simply adapting their techniques to
seize opportunities in an increasingly mobile world. The
emergence of the SymbOS/Zitmo.Altr—the first known
version of the Zeus Trojan designed as mobile malware—
underscores the shift in focus by more cybercriminals
toward mobile users (for more on SymbOS/Zitmo.Altr,
see page 7).
Bank fraud enabled by credential-stealing Trojans like
Zeus that target both traditional and mobile Internet
users is poised to remain a favorite moneymaker for
cybercriminals in the year ahead. “Now that malware
developers reportedly have merged the Zeus codebase
with that of the SpyEye Trojan, expect the banking Trojan
threat to only increase in potency in the coming months,”
cautions Andy Norton, threat response manager at Cisco.
However, one recent, positive development has been
international law enforcement’s increased vigilance
toward tracking and taking down cybercrime networks
that execute bank fraud with help from banking Trojans.
In October 2010, for example, authorities, after a lengthy
investigation, exposed a well-established, multinational
group of scammers delivering malware via Zeus. (Their

earlier in this report, the worm has the potential to
severely disrupt industrial computing systems, such as
those used for facilities like power stations—and can
deflect remediation and response actions from security
professionals. Cisco cybersecurity experts predict that
Stuxnet is the debut offering in a new area for extensive
research and development by some cybercriminals:
hypertargeted malware.

—Seth Hanford, Intelligence Operations team lead, Cisco

Stuxnet is considered a question mark by cybersecurity
experts because its potential is difficult to assess: It
can be programmed with enough intelligence to carry
out a very specific action against a particular target,
and essentially, defend itself against the efforts of
security personnel. Experts warn that variants of Stuxnet
could be developed to target a wide range of critical
infrastructure, from water supplies to transportation
systems—or even industrial or business targets, such
as chemical or automotive plants.28

takedown was so significant, it helped to move down the
needle on this year’s Cisco Global ARMS Race Index.)
It was reported that the U.S. FBI, working in partnership
with international law enforcement in the Netherlands,
Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, disrupted an elaborate
cybercrime network that had been targeting small
to midsize companies, municipalities, churches, and
individuals by infecting their computers with malware
delivered by Zeus.26
According to FBI reports, the group was able to steal
US$70 million from victims’ bank accounts—although
they had been aiming to collect as much as US$220
million before they were caught. Operation “Trident
Breach” was launched in May 2009 after FBI agents in
Omaha, Nebraska, learned of automated clearing house
(ACH) batch payments, initiated by money mules, that
were sent to 46 separate bank accounts in the United
States.27 (For more about money mules, see page 8.)
While there has been good news to report in 2010,
there is still a big question mark on the cybercrime
horizon that must be monitored in the months
ahead: Stuxnet—the “Evil” award winner in this year’s
Cybercrime Showcase (see page 4). As discussed

What this type of threat is capable of in the future will be
largely determined by what the cybercriminals designing
and deploying it intend to achieve, and what their own
technological capabilities are. In a November 2010
hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland
Security and Governmental Affairs, Michael Assante,
president of the National Board of Information Security
Examiners (NBISE), a not-for-profit certification body
focused on information security practices and policies,
said, “Stuxnet is, at the very least, an important wakeup call for digitally enhanced and reliant countries—at its
worst, a blueprint for future attackers.” He added that
the malware’s sophistication “should disturb security
professionals, engineers, businessmen, and government
leaders alike.”29

Cybercriminals in 2011: Compromising Trust,
Cashing In, and Carrying Out More Complex Missions

In 2011, as enterprises continue to grapple with how
best to address security issues around mobile devices,
mobile working, and trends such as virtualization,
and develop a cybersecurity plan that both protects
and enhances the productivity of their employees,
cybercriminals will continue to try to more effectively
manage and fully profit from their own success.

And while this year’s Cisco Global ARMS Race Index
shows a modest reduction in the number of compromised
resources worldwide compared to 2009, what has not
abated is criminals’ reliance on trust exploitation. Expect
to see more creativity in campaigns against select
individuals, either taking advantage of someone’s trust,
or compromising others to reach an intended target.

Not having enough “personnel” to serve as money
mules, or “wranglers” to recruit and manage them
reliably, is a serious bottleneck to cybercriminals’
profitability. Therefore, in the months ahead, expect
cybercriminals worldwide to focus more resources
toward developing money muling operations that
are more sophisticated, creative, complex, and
multinational, and structured and managed in a way
that enables perpetrators to attract more “candidates”
for hire, achieve quick profits, conceal their ultimate
whereabouts, and stay ahead of law enforcement.

There is also the potential for more Stuxnet-style
targeting of corporations and infrastructure, carried
out by ambitious or vengeful cybercriminals who may
either work alone or are enlisted by others to carry
out misdeeds and create disruption—or, at least, incite
fear around the prospect of “What if?”

All contents are Copyright © 2010–2011 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. This document is Cisco Public Information.

The headline-grabbing DDoS attacks launched in late
2010 by supporters of WikiLeaks.org do not mark a shift
in how profit-oriented cybercriminals will be investing
their resources in the year ahead (see The Cisco
Cybercrime Return on Investment Matrix, page 6). But
these events should motivate organizations to review the
strength of current cybersecurity measures, including
existing threat response and disruption reduction plans,
while also protecting their data, employees, customers,
and partners.
“We predicted that we would see more politically
motivated online attacks in 2010,” notes Patrick
Peterson, senior security researcher and Cisco Fellow.
“So, the ‘hacktivism’ following WikiLeaks was not a
surprise—it’s a trend that’s been on the rise since 2007.
If people want to make a statement, and be heard,
it’s only logical they would do so through the Internet.
What’s more interesting, perhaps, is how easy it was for
hackers to create disruption for some major businesses.
That’s really the wake-up call. Enterprises must take
seriously the need to maintain effective cybersecurity
because they could be targeted at anytime, for any
reason, by anybody.”
For many operators in the shadow economy, the interest
is no longer in how many victims they can touch. They
know they can collect what they need from more than
enough faceless victims, and thanks to the proliferation
of mobile devices, have the opportunity to target even
more individuals worldwide. Moving forward, the real
challenge for some of the more sophisticated players
in the cybercrime community will be whether they can
bend technology enough to their advantage so they
can target with precision exactly the person, business,
organization, or government they want to somehow
influence or cause harm to, and carry out a highly specific
mission successfully, or even repeatedly, before detection.
