A Look At Recent Tinba Banking Trojan Variant
zscaler.com/blogs/research/look-recent-tinba-banking-trojan-variant

Introduction
Tinba is information stealing Trojan. The main purpose of the malware is to steal information
that could be browsing data, login credentials, or even banking information. This is achieved
through code injection into system process (Winver.exe and Explorer.exe) and installing
hooks into various browsers like IExplorer, Chrome, Firefox and Opera.
Tinba has been known to arrive via spammed e-mail attachments and drive-by downloads.
Recently, Angler Exploit Kit instances were also found to be serving Tinba banking Trojan.
Detailed Analysis of Tinba
Tinba is packed with a custom packer and uses well known anti-debugging technique using
the WinAPI function “IsDebuggerPresent” to hinder reverse engineering of the binary
image. The execution flow of the infection cycle for Tinba is shown below.

Execution flow of Tinba

The image below shows the custom packer code being used by the Tinba sample we were
looking at.

Tinba unpacking Routine
The unpacked binary image is shown below which upon execution will perform code
injection into system processes like Winver.exe and Explorer.exe.

Unpacked Binary
It generates Mutex name using root volume information of the victim’s machine as shown
below.

Remote Thread in System Process
A remote thread is created inside Explorer process that is responsible for creating a copy of
Tinba Binary in %APPDATA% & auto start registry entry in Registry hive.

Explorer remote thread
The Tinba binary is stored in a hidden folder which is created under %APPDATA%
directory:
C:\Documents and setting \username \Application Data\mutexname\bin.exe
It also creates an auto-run registry entry to execute Tinba binary during every windows
start-up as shown below:

Auto start registry entry

Another thread is also created in Explorer process which is responsible for generating DGA
(Domain Generation Algorithm) domains and injecting code into browsers like IExplorer,
Chrome, Firefox and Opera.

Explorer local thread
Domain Generation Algorithm
The following is the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) used by Tinba variant where every
sample uses a hardcoded domain and seed to generate the DGA domains.

Hardcoded Domain and seed
These DGA domains are fast flux domains where single domain is frequently switched to
different IPs by registering it as part of the DNS A record list for a single domain.

Remote Thread in browsers The Explorer thread searches for browser process either by
checking path of the browser executable or by loaded application specific DLL (e.g.
NSS3.dll for firefox.exe). If the targeted browser process is found, then the secondary
thread is created in the process.

Browser thread
This thread is responsible to get updated Bot configuration details like Target URL list and
strings (BOTUID ) from a remote C&C server. If there is no updated list of target URLs from
C&C server, then it uses default targeted list of URLs which is stored in the injected code.
The list of default target URLs after decryption is shown below.

Default Targeted URL list
The collected information form webmail, social media and the banking sites are stored in
"log.dat" file.

volume & version information. The cryptography routine is a simple byte 'XOR' with an 8 bit
'ROR' of the key after each write.

A sample Tinba POST request to DGA domains with 157 bytes of encrypted data is shown
below.

Tinba also known as small banking Trojan continues to be prevalent in the wild. The arrival
method varies from e-mail spam, drive-by downloads and most recently Exploit Kit infection
cycle. Zscaler ThreatlabZ is actively monitoring this malware family and ensuring coverage
