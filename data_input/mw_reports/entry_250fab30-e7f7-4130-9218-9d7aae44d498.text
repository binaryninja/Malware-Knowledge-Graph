Foreword
This report is a follow-up on our DustySky operation report from January 20161. It analyses new attacks by
Molerats against targets in Israel, The United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and The
Palestinian Authority.
We elaborate on the scope and targeting of the DustySky campaign and expose new infrastructure and
incidents. In addition, we expose the identity of an individual who is behind the DustySky campaign.
Following the previous report, this individual has contacted us trying to learn what we know about him.
Attacks against all targets in the Middle East stopped at once, after we published our first report. However,
the attacks against targets in the Middle East (except Israel) were renewed in less than 20 days. In the
beginning of April 2016, we found evidence that the attacks against Israel have been renewed as well2.
Based on the type of targets, on Gaza being the source of the attacks, and on the type of information the
attackers are after - we estimate with medium-high certainty that the Hamas terrorist organization3 is
behind these attacks.

Acknowledgments
This research was facilitated by the PassiveTotal for threat infrastructure analysis.
We would like to thank the security researchers and organizations who shared information and provided
feedback, which have been crucial for this research.

The report seems to have indeed disrupted the attacker for several months. In a PDB found in a sample from the April
wave, there is an indication that the attacker saw that wave as “part 2” of the attacks (part 1 being the attacks before
the public report): Name D:\IL\Working Tools\2016-04-23 NeD Ver 9 Ran Il - 192.52.167.118\NeD Download and

Background
DustySky is a multi-stage malware written in .NET (recently ported to C++). It is composed of a DustySky
dropper, DustySky core, and the DustySky keylogging component. It has been developed and used since May
2015 by Molerats (aka "Gaza cybergang"), a terrorist group whose main objective in this campaign is
intelligence gathering.
A wave of malicious email messages has been sent on a weekly basis to hundreds of targets. The email
message and the lure documents are written in Hebrew, Arabic or English. The attackers would send a
malicious email message that either links to an archive file (RAR or ZIP compressed) or has one attached to it.
The archive contains an .exe file, sometimes disguised as a Microsoft Word file, a video, or another file
format, using the corresponding icon. We have also found samples that use Microsoft Word files embeded
with a malicious macro, which would infect the victim if enabled. In all cases the attackers rely on social
engineering - convincing the victim to open the file (and enabling content if it is disabled) - and not on
software vulnerabilities
In addition to DustySky, the attackers use publicly available tools such as the following Remote
Administration Tools (RAT): Poison ivy, Nano Core, XtremeRAT, DarkComet and Spy-Net. These tools have
been used either following an initial DustySky infection, or by themselves.
Targeted sectors are mostly governmental and diplomatic institutions including embassies; companies from
the aerospace and defense Industries; financial institutions; journalists; software developers.
Most targets are from the Middle East, some are in the United States and Europe.
In January 2016 we've published an extensive report about the campaign and malware - “Operation
DustySky” - which is available here: clearskysec.com/dustysky

Targeting and Incidents
Who are they after?
Targeting in Hebrew and English
Below are examples of lure documents presented to the victim while the malware infects the computer. The
content of the document is always copied from an online public source. The subject usually revolves around
defense and security or current affairs. Once in a while other topics or content are used - such as a public
corporate responsibility document published by Egged, an Israeli bus company; a part of an online Novel
published as a doc file; or pornographic materials.

Ynet news

In a recent wave, a bit.ly link (https://bitly[.]com/1YRoIPX) was used instead of a direct link to the malware
(bit.ly is a legitimate URL shortening service). The shortened link statistics page enables us to learn about the
scope and the targeting of this threat actor.
We can see that the link was clicked 210 times, out of which 130 were in Israel, 32 in the United States, 9 in
the Palestinian authority, and 39 from 12 other countries (1-5 each).

The statistics do not necessarily reflect the exact distribution of targets: one target may click more than one
time; a proxy or VPN may skew the country count; and security researchers and bots may also comprise part
of the clicks. However, they do roughly represent the scope of the campaign: tens to few hundreds of
recipients - mostly in Israel, the United States and the Palestinian Territories.
This corresponds to the distribution we know of based on other sources such as direct reports from targets,
cases we have investigated, and open source intelligence.

Targeting in arabic
Below are examples of a document and a malicious email, targeting Arabic speaking victims.

(The true story behind the death of the leader Farid Ismail in Scorpio prison)

When targeting Arab-speaking counties, most targets are in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, The Palestinian authority
and United Arab Emirates.
We have learned of more than 150 targets in these countries when investigating a breached email account
used by the attackers to send further malicious emails.
About 60% of targeted the email addresses where Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo accounts. The rest of the email
accounts were in organizations - both private and governmental.

What are they after?
The malware scans the computer for files that contain certain keywords. The list of keywords, in base64
format, is retrieved from the command and control server as a text file. For example:

These words indicate what information the attackers are after - information pertaining to homeland security
and military issues; personal documents; credentials, certificates and private keys.
Below are keywords that have been used in the recent campaigns:

Infrastructure
As in previous cases, the attackers still serve copied content on IPs, domains and hosts they control. For
example, one of the command and control servers, mafy.2waky[.]com, serves content copied from a
legitimate unrelated website - radaronline.com. The copied content is probably there just to confuse
suspecting targets and security researchers.

In other cases, the visitor was redirected via HTTP 301 response to a legitimate unrelated website www.onlinepcsupport.co.uk.

Key C2 and delivery servers
The attackers have been using IP address 192.52.167.118 since the beginning of January. In the Heat map
below, we can see that new hosts/domains (marked by orange triangle) have pointed to it during JanuaryFebruary and again in May.

Threat Actor and Attribution
The DustySky campaign has been going on for over a year, with more than 120 command and control
hostnames, and dozens of known unique malware samples. However, it has not been technologically
advanced, and the infrastructure and attacks have not been operated professionally.
Open directories were often left on delivery servers. Traces were left on infected systems and abused email
accounts. Malware delivery was often predictable, contained spelling mistakes or even irrelevant lure
documents, and were easy to identify. Most importantly, the attacker forgot to cover his trails, enabling us
to learn his identity.

Threat actor
In the beginning of December 2015, three samples were submitted to online malware detection and analysis
platforms malwr.com and Virus Total. The samples were Word documents with a macro version of DustySky.
They were submitted on the same date they were last saved.
The person who last saved the documents (after weaponizing them with the malicious macro) forgot to clear
the file metadata. Thus, the “Last Saved By” properties of the documents contained his username:
moayy2ad@hotmail.com
The images below display this username in the samples metadata:

Invoice details.doc (b1071ab4c3ef255c6ec95628744cfd3d), uploaded on 3 December 20154

Who is moayy2ad@hotmail.com
The unique username moayy2ad enabled us to find plenty of information on the attacker. Googling for
moayy2ad@hotmail.com led the following blog7, which has been removed in the months after we published
the first report:

The blog was created by mo’ayyad on Blogger, who is also using the name mo’ayy. This profile has been
made private following our publication.

Searching for the same username in Gmail (moayy2ad@gmail.com) yielded further results. A Google+ profile8
with a similar nickname – Mo’ay - was connected to this address. The profile has also been disabled in the months
after we published the first report.

The owner of the Gmail account has developed a flashlight app9. In the app’s page we learn that he uses the
name Mo'ayyad Ay and that he is from Gaza”

In the YouTube channel10 linked to moayy2ad@gmail.com (which, like the other accounts, has been made
private later), the individual has uploaded anti-Israeli propaganda videos:

past few years:

The Gmail address is connected to a Facebook account, probably of a fake identity - Montaser Ali
(https://www.facebook[.]com/montaser.ali.338).

The profile says that the actor resides in Nablus, and that he is a member of a group called “Rebellion –
West-Bank”13.

Contacting ClearSky
In the first DustySky report, we mentioned we know the identity of the attacker, but have decided not to
reveal it. Consequently, the attacker contacted us, trying to learn what we know about him.

By Email
Eleven days after we publicly published “Operation DustySky”, we received the following email

13

https://www.facebook.com/%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B6%D9%81%D8%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-542062199177072/

______________________________________________________________________________
(C) All Rights reserved to C.S. Consultings Ltd, 2016. "ClearSky" www.clearskysec.com
Page 22 of 26

We immediately recognized the email as a fake – coming from an unofficial address - idf.cyber@gmail.com –
and written in English.
The email, allegedly sent by the “Israeli Defense Force cyber team”, asked for undisclosed information we
had about the culprit behind DustySky (the email referred to a statement in the first report in which we
wrote that “we have decided not to disclose this individual’s name in the public report”).

By phone
Few days later, we were contacted again, this time by phone. The caller pretended to be an official in one of
the effected countries mentioned in the report. Similarly, he asked for further information about the identity
of the attacker. We asked the caller to send his request via email. Corroborating the provided contact
information, we learned that this was also a fake.
In both cases, we did not send any information to the attackers. However, we used the new leads to deepen
the investigation.
Below is the email we received:
