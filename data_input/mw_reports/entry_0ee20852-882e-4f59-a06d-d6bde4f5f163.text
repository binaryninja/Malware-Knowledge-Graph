Recent TZW Campaigns Revealed As Part of
GlobeImposter Malware Family

February 15, 2023

In recent years, efforts to apprehend threat groups and shrink their operating landscape have
gone international. As authorities across multiple countries continue to implement sanctions
and openly communicate current trends to the public, threat groups increasingly resort to
rebranding or creating similar variants under different names to sidestep crackdowns and
obfuscate their identities.
In a February 2023 blog post, Ahnlab described a new ransomware campaign affecting
South Korean organizations which deployed a malware they dubbed “TZW” ransomware.
Our research links TZW ransomware to a known malware family called GlobeImposter
(sometimes referred to as LOLNEK or LOLKEK). Close inspection of host origins and
prominent file similarities used in both TZW and GlobeImposter campaigns suggest that
actors behind GlobeImposter are updating their payloads and obfuscating their infrastructure
in a manner consistent with a rebrand effort.

Overview of GlobeImposter & New Variant TZW

1/13

GlobeImposter has a long and winding history. First observed in-the-wild in 2016, the name
“GlobeImposter” is based on the ransomware’s mimicry of Globe ransomware payloads.
Multiple new versions and variations of GlobeImposter have appeared in the years since.
Frequently, these have been referred to by their extension (e.g., .DREAM, .Nutella, .NARCO,
.LEGO). However, these are all part of the same umbrella malware family. In that same year,
Emisoft released a decryption tool for early versions of GlobeImposter. Shortly after, the
malware authors responded with an updated version for which no decryption tools are
available.
Since 2017, campaigns delivering GlobeImposter have continued to proliferate even though
the ransomware has only evolved slightly. The ransomware has also been used in
conjunction with some well-documented high-end cybercriminal groups. For example, in
2017 TA505 (also known as G0092, GOLD TAHOE) began using GlobeImposter in
replacement of Jaff, GandCrab, and Snatch to extend the reach and effectiveness of their
campaigns.

GlobeImposter’s Delivery Methods Explained
GlobeImposter is most often delivered via phishing email as an attachment or a link to a
malicious attachment. The payloads are typically distributed via 7zip or traditional zip file
archives. The archives often include a JavaScript (.js) file that downloads and executes the
GlobeImposter payload.
More recent campaigns from within the past three years still tend to follow this formula.
GlobeImposter has also been distributed as a later-stage infection within some well-known
botnets. For example, in 2017 GlobeImposter was distributed via the Necurs botnet. This
occurred as part of multiple spam campaigns that also included 7zip archives and followed
the execution flow previously described.

Linking TZW Attacks to GlobeImposter
AhnLab’s research revealed a ransomware campaign they referred to as “TZW” with victims
in South Korea. The name is derived from the first 3 characters of the TOR-based victim
portal. A closer look suggests that “TZW” samples represent a new variant of the
GlobeImposter family.
The pre-TZW GlobeImposter ransom notes follow the same template as the current TZW
samples. Ransom note similarities are far from reliable, but it’s worth noting their likenesses.

Example of a TZW variant GlobeImposter ransom note.
Once a machine is infected, more concrete markers indicate a deeper level of similarity. One
such marker is the “CRYPTO LOCKER” string appended to the tail of the encrypted files.
This is a known marker present across GlobeImposter variants.

GlobeImposter has the ability to delete volume shadow copies, thereby inhibiting the
recovery of data. There are clear similarities around the methodology of the VSS removal.

GlobeImposter vs TZW variant shadow copy removal procedure.
Code and functionality, by and large, are identical across GlobeImposter payloads pointing to

pointing to the newer
tzw7ckhurmxgcpajx6gy57dkrysl2sigfrt6nk4a3rvedfldigtor7ad[.]onion.
A thorough comparison of the two respective samples shows there are only minor
differences.

have seen the newer TZW variations vary somewhat with regards to file metadata.

A majority of the TZW variant samples that we have analyzed resemble the version on the
left hand side. The version on the right was seen in the samples noted by AhnLab.

Understanding TZW and GlobeImposter’s Shared Infrastructure
Previous GlobeImposter payloads directed victims to a TOR-based portal at

GlobeImposter Victim Portal 1.
Beginning in late 2022, we start to see victims also being directed to
tzw7ckhurmxgcpajx6gy57dkrysl2sigfrt6nk4a3rvedfldigtor7ad[.]onion. The interfaces

and required steps are identical:

GlobeImposter Victim Portal 2 from late 2022 onward.
At the time of writing, both victim portals remain active. In addition, we can confirm the
relationship between these via the publicly-viewable Apache Server Status Page.
This Apache status screen is visible as a result of a misconfiguration on the Apache server,
allowing us to see all the active vhosts (virtual hosts) present there.

Through this view we see that the following vhosts are active on the device.

This evidence of shared infrastructure suggests that the newly rebranded TZW ransomware
samples are likely being operated by the same group that was pushing recent waves of
GlobeImposter malware.

How to Protect Against GlobeImposter and TZW Ransomware
SentinelOne Singularity™ protects against malicious behaviors and malware associated with
GlobeImposter and TZW.
With the site policy set to Protect, GlobeImposter ransomware is detected and prevented
automatically. In Detect-only mode, analysts can observe the malware’s behaviour and file
encryption attempts, rolling back the device to a clean state on completion of the test.

Conclusion
Based on our analysis, the TZW ransomware recently documented by AhnLab is yet another
example of the threat actors behind GlobeImposter pivoting their TTPs alongside a rebrand,
including a new but related Onion address. We also show that the old “LOLNEK” Onion
address and the Onion address within the TZW variant are hosted on the same server as
two vhosts.
Regardless of the name or brand, GlobeImposter continues to pose a threat to enterprises.
Ensuring good user hygiene, along with strong, properly-configured, and robust security
controls will go a long way to prevent these attacks from affecting your environment.
