Executive Summary
After emerging in January 2022, Royal ransomware is a ransomware strain that is being
distributed by ransomware threat actors from previous operations. Initially, Microsoft
attributed the distribution of Royal ransomware to DEV-0569 – a temporary name given by
the tech company. Now, researchers are stating that the threat actors behind Royal
ransomware have officially branded themselves with the name Royal (the name left behind in
recent ransomware notes) and they are primarily focused on targeting entities within the U.S
The ransomware operation uses unusual techniques to breach networks before encrypting
them with malware and demanding ransom payments. Some Royal ransomware campaigns
distribute the malware via malicious attachments, and some distribute the malware via
malicious advertisements.
Although Royal is a newer ransomware operation, researchers believe the threat actors
behind it are very experienced due to evidence of previously seen tactics and techniques.
Let’s take a look at Royal, their tactics and techniques, and what organizations can do to
protect themselves and keep their cyber environments safe.

royal ransomware attacks
SILVERESTONE CIRCUIT
In September 2022, the operators behind Royal ransomware began ramping up their
malicious activities. They were observed by our technology partner, AdvIntel, utilizing other
ransomware operation’s encryptors, such as BlackCat.
By November 2022, Royal took responsibility for a ransomware attack on one of the United
Kingdom’s most popular racing circuits – Silverstone Circuit. The attack held up dozens of
Formula One races and motorcycle events. Details regarding the attack were not disclosed,
but Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow stated that because Royal’s ransomware is secure,
its encryption cannot be broken. Callow also stated that unlike current ransomware groups,
Royal uses multiple ransomware types and uses the .Royal extension for encrypted files
rather than using randomly generated extensions.

TRAVIS CENTRAL APPRAISAL DISTRICT
The threat actors followed up this attack with an attack on the Travis Central Appraisal
District in December 2022. The agency provides appraisal values for properties. As a result
of the attack, the agency’s servers, website, and email were shut down for more than two
weeks. However, because the agency diversified where its information was stored, it was
able to continue operations.

HC3
Also in December 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services Cybersecurity
Coordination Center (HC3) warned that Royal based ransomware attacks were steadily
increasing. Ransom demands from the threat actor ranged from $250,000 to more than $2
million. HC3 also stated that Royal should be considered a threat to the health and public
health sectors due to the ransomware group victimizing the healthcare community.
Initially Royal was using BlackCat’s encryptor but they transitioned to using their own Zeon
encryptor, leaving behind a ransomware note that looked very similar to Conti’s ransomware
notes. If you recall, Conti was notorious for targeting the healthcare sector as well. The threat
actors behind the Zeon encryptor were seen impersonating healthcare patient data software
back in October 2022.
Avertium’s technology partner, AdvIntel confirmed that the attackers contacted healthcare
employees of targeted organizations and gained access via the Zoho remote access tool.
Since the middle of September 2022, Royal has been using their branded name in their
ransom notes generated by a new encryptor.

Currently, Royal is relying on malicious ads (malvertising), phishing links that point to a
malware downloader masquerading as software installers, updates embedded in spam
emails, fake forum pages, and blog comments to spread their ransomware. The group’s
phishing attacks include callback phishing where they impersonate food delivery and
software providers in emails that look like subscription renewals. The phishing emails contain
phone numbers that the victim must contact to cancel the “subscription”. Once the victim

calls the number, they speak to threat actors who use social engineering to convince the
victim to install remote access software. This remote access software is used to gain initial
access to corporate networks.
Royal does not have a data leak site and they are not a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)
with affiliates. Also, the group is low key and does not announce their attacks. The ransom
note left behind is named README.TXT and contains a link to a private Tor negotiation
page. The negotiation page consists of a chat screen for communication with Royal
ransomware operators. Sometimes, Royal will decrypt a few files to prove to their victims that
their decryptor works. They will also share file lists of stolen data at times.

royal/dev-0569 tactics & techniques
As previously stated, Royal ransomware emerged in January 2022, but their attacks were
not noticed by security researchers until September 2022. Initially attributed to DEV-0569,
Royal ransomware is distributed by vetted threat actors and the attacks using the
ransomware show a pattern of continuous innovation. Royal has displayed a consistent
incorporation of new defense evasion, techniques, and various post-compromise payloads.
Since Royal emerged, the ransomware operators have evolved their delivery methods to
include:
Using Google Ads in a campaign to blend in with normal ad traffic.
Making malicious downloads appear authentic by hosting fake installer files on
legitimate looking software download sites.
Using contact forms located on an organization’s website to distribute phishing links.
4/10

The above methods have allowed the ransomware operators to reach a greater number of
targets and achieve their goal of deploying various post-compromise payloads. Microsoft
stated that Royal uses signed binaries and delivers encrypted malware payloads – relying
heavily on defense evasion techniques.
The group has also continued to use Nsudo, an open-source tool, to try and disable antivirus
solutions. As previously stated, Royal has a few ways of gaining initial access and one of
those ways is via malicious links delivered to their targets. The links are embedded in
advertisements, fake forum pages, phishing emails, and blog comments. After the victim
clicks, the links lead them to malicious files signed by Royal using a legitimate certificate.
The malicious files masquerade as installers or updates for applications such as Zoom or
Microsoft teams. The victim does not know that the files are malware downloaders known as
BATLOADER. When the legitimate applications are launched, BATLOADER uses MSI
Custom Actions to launch malicious PowerShell activity. BATLOADER also uses the MSI
Custom Actions to run batch scripts that attempt to disable security solutions, leading to the
delivery of various encrypted malware payloads.
Between August and October 2022, Royal’s observed activity included BATLOADER being
hosted on attacker-created domains masquerading as software download sites such as
anydeskos[.]com, and on legitimate repositories such as OneDrive and GitHub.

In addition to using installer files, Royal uses file formats such as Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) to
impersonate legitimate software for first-stage payloads. Royal also uses various infection
chains that use PowerShell and batch scripts, ultimately leading to the download of malware
payloads such as a legitimate remote management tool used for persistence on the network.
The management tool also acts as an access point for the staging and spreading of
ransomware.

5/10

By late October 2022, Royal was using malicious Google Ads to deliver BATLOADER in
what researchers are calling a malvertising campaign. The Google Ads pointed to the
legitimate traffic distribution system (TDS) Keitaro. According to Microsoft, Keitaro provides
capabilities to customize advertising campaigns via tracking and ad traffic and user or
device-based filtering. The TDS redirects the victim to a legitimate download site or to a
malicious BATLOADER download site. By using Keitaro, Royal can filter traffic and avoid IP
ranges of known security sandboxing solutions.

what organizations can do
Although there are no confirmed reports of successful ransomware payments between Royal
and their victims, evolving ransomware groups like Royal don’t give up easily. They will keep
evolving their tactics and techniques, targeting enterprises and organizations until they
achieve their ultimate goal – financial gain. Fortunately, there are ways organizations can
stay safe and protect themselves from Royal:
Enabling Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will help guard against phishing by
inspecting the body of emails and URLs for patterns.
Royal’s phishing campaigns abuses legitimate services; therefore, organizations should
leverage mail flow rules and capture suspicious keywords or review broad exceptions
such as those related to domain-level allow lists and IP ranges.
Also, enabling Safe Links for Microsoft Teams, emails, and Office Apps will also help
keep your organization safe.
User awareness training regarding email threats and social engineering will help build
resilience against Royal. After training, provide users with a method for reporting a
suspected attack.
Organizations should maintain credential hygiene and practice the principle of least
privilege. This means that an organization should provide access a user absolutely
needs to do their job. Organizations should also ensure that the accounts have strong
passwords and multifactor authentication.
To prevent threat actors from stopping security services, organizations should turn on
tamper-protection features.
Making sure that your organization takes proactive measures by keeping track of Indicators
of Compromise (IoCs) and by keeping track of Royal’s attack methods will ensure good
defense against Royal ransomware.

avertium's recommendations
The FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations to apply the following
recommendations to prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware
incidents:
Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your
organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software
or hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.

7/10

Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or
proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location
(i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).

Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and
domain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.

Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or
unrecognized accounts.
Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can
help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and
access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.

Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.

Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and
lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If
threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating
privileges and/or moving laterally.
