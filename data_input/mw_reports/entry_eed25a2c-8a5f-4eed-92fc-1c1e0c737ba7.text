This redacted report is based on our actual proactive victim breach intelligence and
subsequent incident response (not a simulated or sandbox environment) identified via unique
high-value Conti ransomware collections at AdvIntel via our product “Andariel.”

This is a redacted TLP:WHITE version of the larger AdvIntel findings.

Conti Ransomware Log4Shell Operation

Background: Log4Shell Vulnerability

On December 11, 2021, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
released an urgent announcement on possibly the most important vulnerability of recent
years:

“To be clear, this (Log4j2) vulnerability poses a severe risk. We urge all organizations to join
us in this essential effort and take action. By bringing together key government and private
sector partners via the JCDC, including our partners at the FBI and NSA, we will ensure that
our country’s strongest capabilities are brought to bear in an integrated manner against this
risk.”

2/9

CISA’s concerning tone is understandable: the new vulnerability is not another hidden path
for a malicious attack. Embedded deeply in the stack level it offers the attackers an entire
new dimension of offensive patterns. The depth is transferred to scale as this vulnerability
affects core library components supporting thousands of networks, companies, and
machines across the world.

Recorded in the vulnerability database on Friday, November 26, 2021, the Apache Log4j2
Java-based logging library vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 has the highest possible severity
score of Base Score: 10.0 CRITICAL allowing direct remote code execution on the
vulnerable machines. Due to its core component impact, this vulnerability in some way can
be compared to the Apache Struts vulnerability CVE-2019-0230: Apache Struts OGNL
Remote Code Execution that led to the breach of Equifax.

Multiple technologies and products run Log4j2 library including popular vCenter, Kafka,
Elastic, and Minecraft presenting an attack surface for the attackers.

The current activity surrounding the vulnerability resulted in massive world scanning with the
payloads running from miners, unix DDoS malware, and framework stagers pushed to the
compromised hosts.

Conti: A Quest For Ultimate Ransomware Exploitation

Naturally, this new attack domain became the focal point of hackers’ interests. Hacker teams
suspected to work for foreign governments and US adversaries were quickly spotted to
investigate Log4j2. And as the new adversarial pattern seen with ProxyLogon in March 2021
suggests, if one day a major CVE is spotted by APTs, the next week it is weaponized by
ransomware.

And indeed, a week after the Log4j2 vulnerability became public, AdvIntel discovered the
most concerning trend - the exploitation of the new CVE by one of the most prolific organized
ransomware groups - Conti.

3/9

Conti plays a special role in today’s threat landscape, primarily due to its scale. Divided on
several teams and involving tenths of full-time members, the Russian-speaking Conti made
over $150 million USD in the last six months, according to AdvIntel research into the
ransomware logs. And they continue to expand. It is this expansion that has set Conti on a
long quest of searching for new attack surfaces and methods. Since August, they have
employed many new means: hidden RMM backdoors, new backup removal solutions, and,
most recently, even an entire operation to revive Emotet.

Moreover, Conti already had a history of leveraging exploits as an initial attack vector and for
lateral movement. For instance, the group leverages Fortinet VPN vulnerability CVE-201813379 to target unpatched devices for the initial attack vector. Conti favors PrintNightmare
privilege elevation CVE-2021-34527/CVE-2021-1675, Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472), and
ms17-010 for local privilege elevation and lateral movement on the compromised hosts.

As such, Log4j2 vulnerability appears at a time for Conti: at the moment when the syndicate
has both the strategic intention and the capability to weaponize it for its ransomware goals.

December 15, 2021 - Targeting of vCenter networks for lateral movement
On December 12, through deep visibility into adversarial collections, AdvIntel discovered that
multiple Conti group members expressed interest in the exploitation of the vulnerability for
the initial attack vector resulting in the scanning activity leveraging the publicly available
Log4J2 exploit. This is the first time this vulnerability entered the radar of a major
ransomware group.

The current exploitation led to multiple use cases through which the Conti group tested the
possibilities of utilizing the Log4J2 exploit. Most importantly, AdvIntel confirmed that the
criminals pursued targeting specific vulnerable Log4J2 VMware vCenter for lateral
movement directly from the compromised network resulting in vCenter access affecting US
and European victim networks from the pre-existent Cobalt Strike sessions.

Early Warning: Ransomware Exploitation of Core Vulnerability

It is only a matter of time until Conti and possibly other groups will begin exploiting Log4j2 to
its full capacity. It is recommended to patch the vulnerable system immediately and view the
Log4j2 as a ransomware group exploitation vector.
