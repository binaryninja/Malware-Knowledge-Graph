Executive summary

Global Windows malware
detections increased by

It was the last year of the 2010s, and cybercriminals
let the world know they meant business. From an
increase in enterprise-focused threats to diversification
of sophisticated hacking, evasion, and stealth techniques
to aggressive adware aimed at Androids, the 2019 threat
landscape was shaped by a cybercrime industry that was all
grown up.

13% on business endpoints
While Malwarebytes observed a relative plateau in the overall volume of threat
detections in 2019, our telemetry showed a clear trend toward industrialization.
Global Windows malware detections on business endpoints increased by 13
percent, and a bifurcation of attack techniques split threat categories neatly
between those targeting consumers and those affecting organizations’
networks. The Trojan-turned-botnets Emotet and TrickBot made a return in

Ryuk, Sodinokibi, and Phobos. In addition, a flood of hack tools and registry
key disablers made a splashy debut in our top detections, a reflection of the
greater sophistication used by today’s business-focused attackers.
Meanwhile, the 2019 mobile threat landscape fared no better. While
Malwarebytes launched a massive drive to combat stalkerware—apps that
enable users to monitor their partners’ every digital move—which led to an
increase in our detections, other nefarious threats lingered on the horizon,

percent, respectively. Two regions saw decreases
in overall threats: EMEA detections dropped by 2
percent and APAC, outside of Australia, New Zealand,
and Singapore, decreased by 11 percent. In Australia
and New Zealand, the dip was more prominent at 14
percent. North America was at the receiving end of
more than 24 million threats, up 10 percent from 2018.
But LATAM saw the most growth in 2019, up to 7.2
million detections, an increase of 26 percent.
❱ On the web threats front, a shift by browser
developers to rely more on the Chromium platform
gave us concern for the discovery and development
of new exploits against today and tomorrow’s browser
applications, and not just for the aging and dwindling
Internet Explorer. Meanwhile, web skimmer activity
was at an all-time high in 2019, with groups like
MageCart aggressively modifying payment processor
sites to steal financial information without the need
for malware to be installed on the endpoint.
❱ Finally, data privacy was heavy on the public mind in
2019, post-GDPR. Several new pieces of legislation
were passed in the United States, including laws in
Maine, Nevada, and California that may serve as the
backbone for future federal regulation. In addition,
tech companies such as Apple, Malwarebytes,
ProtonMail, and Mozilla launched privacy-forward
products in 2019, including tracking blockers,
tracking-free browsers, and encrypted calendar
tools. On the flip side, many privacy blunders were
made by tech juggernauts, such as Google, Amazon,
and Facebook, who shipped products with secret
microphone features and vulnerabilities enabling
customer data to be viewed by employees, sold
user data to third-party companies without express
permission, and committed other manhandlings of
user PII. While the companies publicly pledged to do
better on privacy, their revenue models are largely
dependent on advertising dollars—meaning user data
is their most valuable asset.

Unlike other attacks that often require to either infect

and browsers. This makes it particularly effective and
scalable to harvest and monetize stolen credit cards.

many skimmers are virtually invisible because they rely

The same goes for WebSocket, which is a different
protocol than the most commonly used HTTP. Rather
than looking at a series of requests and responses, one
has to observe the bidirectional messages inside the
WebSocket. By adding custom obfuscation to those
communications, the exfiltration of stolen credit card
