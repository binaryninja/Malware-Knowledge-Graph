A SecPro Super Issue: Understanding LockBit
For those of you in the UK, you may be winding down for the week already and ready for the
Queen’s Platinum Jubilee – a celebration of a monarch who has seen the world change from
the low tech world of the 1950s to the technological revolution that we are living through
today. In a world completely unimaginably different to those who witnessed a coronation in
1953, taking a minute to reflect on the leaps and bounds we have made as a species is
something that people often forget to do.
Of course, the rise of modern computers saw another significant rise – cybercriminals. No
one is more aware of the rising threat than cybersecurity professionals, so here’s some light
reading for the long weekend. If you’re not in the UK, you can just enjoy a super issue
without the special occasion.
Thanks for reading and we’ll see you again on Friday!
Cheers!

Understanding the LockBit Ransomware
By Andy Pantelli

Breaking down the Bitwise Spider APT
Looking at the origins of the Adversary, how the group evolved, and how they became one of
most prolific criminal gangs using Ransomware-as-a-Service. We will take a look at the
Tactics, Techniques & Procedures the adversary uses and break these down.

The origins of BitWise Spider began in September of 2019. Known then as ABCD
Ransomware the gang set about promoting and supporting their operation via Russian
language forums. Developing a strong professional operation until June 2021 when the
group were banned from posting on Cyber Security forums. This prompted a rebrand with
the group changing name to BitWise Spider and at the same time releasing LockBit 2.0
ransomware & the StealBit information stealer.
This appears to be a milestone for the group which then saw increase in their reputation and
popularity amongst the Dark Web Community having matured & added much more
functionality into Lockbit 2.0 Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). We will take a deeper look
in more detail later in the article at the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures) used by the
adversary.
Having become one of the most prolific Ransomware gangs the group looked to mature their
software, and the business model. LockBit operations were by now increasing and
developing the recruitment and marketing with affiliates. What exactly is an ‘affiliate’?

2/17

Ransomware-as-a-Service developers can maximize their product exposure by providing it
to third parties, or ‘affiliates’ who in turn focus themselves on targeting victims and infecting
their networks. There is a monetary trade between the developers and the affiliates for the
number of infections and the numbers of users within an infected organization.
This model worked for BitWise Spider successfully allowing them to focus on development
and profit, but also provides a layer between the gang and the victim making detection or
prosecution of the developers more difficult with obscurity. Affiliate schemes are used by
almost all Ransomware developers who provide the affiliate with a unique identifier in
specific code within the Ransomware which directs any payout to the affiliate that caused the
infection.

BitWise Spider comes of age
In March of 2022 the gang had matured their code, enriched features, added functionality
and introduced new tactics. This included data extortion as they began to detail new victims
through their Dark Web site. Using an array of techniques, tactics & procedures (TTP) the
group were responsible for many high profile attacks such as the one in 2021 against
Accenture, who were at the time were in the process of a marketing campaign to recruit new
affiliates. The Fortune 500 Company was later to confirm the breach with a $50m ransom
demanded otherwise the company data would be leaked. Accenture were soon forced to file
a data breach in the October SEC filings after “extraction of proprietary information.” during
the August attack.
LockBit has undergone some major development releasing a new version including several
new features; automatic encryption of devices across Microsoft Windows Active Directory
Domains, the removal of shadow copies, self-propagation, the ability to bypass User Account
Control Settings (UAC), ESXi support, and even the capability of printing Ransom notes via
the victim’s network connected printers. Some of the techniques seen are publicly available
such as privilege escalation by using the Mimikatz tool but also the group also claim to have
the fastest encryption method which employs a multithread approach using some of the
following methods to boost performance:
• Open files with the FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING flag, write by sector size
• Transfer work with files to Native API
• Use asynchronous file I/O
• Use I/O port completion
• Pass control to the kernel yourself, Google KiFastSystemCall
Not content with this improvement, the developers at BitWise Spider introduced StealBit to
shift their tactics by employing data exfiltration as a double extortion tactic. Victims of
Ransomware may not be willing to pay the fee in some instances, this could be for a number
of reasons, lack of financial resources, available backups, concerns that if a payment were to

be made to the blackmailers then would the data even be unencrypted? All this made
criminal gangs look towards threatening victims of Ransomware that unless a payment were
made to the gang then the malicious actors would release the data online or even sell it.
StealBit is developed and maintained by the group and as seen by the graphic
compares favourably against other Ransomware tools:

MITRE ATT&CK
Tactics, techniques & procedures (TTPs) observed to be used by the adversary:

5/17

Industries & Countries Targeted
LockBit targets diverse industry sectors & geographical regions. Most attacks are observed
in the US, India & Brazil with the Commonwealth of Independent States being avoided.
Business sectors indicate the Healthcare closely followed by the Education Sector although
the group have issued a statement to claim that they do not target “healthcare, charity or
educational institutions”. This has prompted the US Department of Health Services HHS) to
issue “contradictory code of ethics” note warning the public not to rely on such statements
and these are shown not be true.
Initial Access
LockBit affiliates gain access via compromised servers, or by using RDP or VPN accounts
using brute force insecure credentials. A further delivery method is by exploiting Fortinet
VPN CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability. LockBit also makes use of Mimikatz to escalate
privileges.
6/17

Execution
Executed by command line or by scheduled tasks and can be propagated in other machines.
It is also known to use PowerShell Empire post exploitation agent.
Persistence
Registry Run Keys / Start up Folders
Discovery
Advanced Port Scanner, Network Scanner & AdFind are used to enumerate connected
machines.
Lateral movement
Self-Propagation via SMB using compromised credentials or Group Policy. PsExec or Cobalt
Strike is used for lateral movement.
Exfiltration
Data extracted to Cloud Storage Web Applications MEGA, or FreeFileSync. Also used for
exfiltration is the groups own StealBit.
Impact
Ransomware payload will encrypt victim machines upon execution. This includes local and
network drives. Encrypting with AES-256. Can print ransom note using connected printers.
The desktop wallpaper is also replaced.

Ransom note, file name Restore-My-Files.txt

Tactics
The use of affiliates, marketing & the gangs Direct Leak Site to upload stolen data are direct
tactics to propagate the monetization. Offering Ransomware-as-a-Service provides a tactic
to avoid direct involvement and obfuscate any law enforcement action.

7/17

Known target industries include and are not limited to Cryptocurrency, Academics, Aviation,
Aerospace, Healthcare Insurance, Food and Beverage, Chemicals Energy Oil and Gas,
Manufacturing, Hospitality, Real Estate Travel, Opportunistic, Logistics Transportation, Legal,
Retail, and Government.
The known 74 target countries include Taiwan, China, Poland, Netherlands, Mexico, the
United States, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Chile, Vietnam, and Peru.
The gang have developed a strong selling point with affiliates using the speed of the
malware with its capabilities being well known. The group maximizes this selling point
through various means of publicity. External factors influence the targeting of victims with a
preference for victims that have concerns over GPDR in Europe.
Techniques
As with many Ransomware gangs LockBit will the check system language to avoid
encrypting systems in Russia or other nearby CIS states The Malware issues the
commands GetSystemDefaultUILanguage and GetUserDefaultUILanguage to check if the
system of user default UI is in the language list to avoid.
Azerbaijani (Cyrillic, Azerbaijan), Azerbaijani (Latin, Azerbaijan), Armenian (Armenia),
Belarusian (Belarus), Georgian (Georgia), Kazakh (Kazakhstan), Kyrgyz (Kyrgyzstan),
Russian (Moldova), Russian (Russia), Tajik (Cyrillic, Tajikistan), Turkmen (Turkmenistan),
Uzbek (Cyrillic, Uzbekistan), Uzbek (Latin, Uzbekistan), and Ukrainian (Ukraine).

The malware uses and Ifstatement and calls ExitProcess to terminate itself if the user of
system UI language is identified.

8/17

Strings seen in LockBit executables are encoded and then stored as a stack string. Before
use they are decoded dynamically through computations such as addition, subtraction or
XOR, this is the Stack String Anti-Analysis.
As with many major Ransomware variants LockBit resolves APIs dynamically to make the
Inline Anti-Analysis more difficult but the gang have enhanced the technique by making the
entire resolving process inline which makes the decompiled code much larger, and therefore
more difficult & time consuming to analyse.
Then using methods to load the API libraries into memory, the malware uses hashing &
obfuscation methods to access the DLL base and export table which returns the target API
address. After loading all required libraries LockBit will restrict access to its own process by
calling NTOpenProcess to get a handle on the current process then
resolve GetSecurityInfo to get the process security descriptor.
By initializing an SID for the EVERYONE group and using the RtlAddAccessDeniedAce to
add the ACCESS_DENIED access control entry for the EVERYONE group the malware
process is effectively protected. Additional ACEs are iterated for each process that the
malware uses. Critical system messages are suppressed and calls
to RtlAdjustPrivilege which enables the SE_TAKE_OWNERSHIP_PRIVILEGE.

Privilege escalation
In the next stages LockBit will look to elevate privilege of the user account using
the GetTokenInformation call to retrieve information about the user account associated with
the Token. Using a combination retrieving and comparing account SID the malware begins

9/17

the process to escalate itself.

Logging
The malware then makes a number of calls to create hidden debug windows which can be
viewed during the process by a combination of hot keys Shift+F1.

Command Line
Command-line is to be used with or without arguments. Once encryption of the target
file/directory is complete the process is terminated

Mutex

10/17

LockBit checks for, and avoids multiple Ransomware instances by checking the stack string \
{\%02X%02X%02X%02X-%02X%02X-%02X%02X-%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%%02X}”

Active Directory
LockBit seeks out the OS Version, if Windows Vista or above it tries to create and set up new
group policies for other hosts within Active Directory using NtQueryInformationToken_1 and
the NtOpenProcessToken commands the malware looks up the Admin account and Domain.
To then connect to the AD Domain LockBit will generate the LDAP display name for the
Group Policy Object.
By resolving the stack string and formats it with the public key. Manually extracting the DNS
Domain Name, and name LockBit is able to create a new GPO, lastly the path is built by
formatting the string LDAP://CN=<GPO GUID>,CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=<Domain
component 1>,DC=<Domain Component 2> which allows the AD path and GPO to
call CreateGPOLink to connect the GPO to the Active Directory Domain.
DNS Retrieval
LockBit formats ScheduledTasks.xml file to execute a taskkill.exe for each process in the
process list before dropping in the Registy.pol file1 which contains the following list of registry
paths and values:
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\DisableAntiSpyware: True
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time
Protection\DisableRealtimeMonitoring: True
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Spynet\SubmitSamplesConsent: Never
send
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
Defender\Threats\Threats_ThreatSeverityDefaultAction: Enabled
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Threats\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction\Low:
Ignored
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
Defender\Threats\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction\Medium: Ignored
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Threats\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction\High:
Ignored
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
Defender\Threats\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction\Severe: Ignored
• Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration\Notification_Suppress:
Enabled

11/17

These following registry configurations disable Windows Defender features such as antispyware, real-time protection, submitting samples to Microsoft servers, default actions, and
displaying notification on all network hosts.
Persistence
Before executing encryption routines LockBit configures persistence using Registry Keys if
the Malware is interrupted by a system shutdown. Once encryption is complete, the malware
will remove the persistence key calling RegDeleValueW to prevent itself from running again if
the user restarts the machine following encryption.

Deleting backups
LockBit will delete shadow copies by resolving the string /c vssadmin delete shadows /all
/quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete & bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures &
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no then passes the fields to ShellExecuteA. The
command uses vssadmin and wmic to delete all shadow copies and bcdedit to disable file
recovery.
Wallpaper
Setting the default file extension, desktop background and ransom note printing tasks are
completed.

Printing

12/17

Using the call EnumPrintersW to retrieve printers’ information. The internal function resolves
two strings Microsoft Print to PDF and Microsoft XPS Document Writer to compare the
printer name. If the value is one of the two, the function will exit and the ransom note will not
be printed.
This is to ensure that the note is not printed to a file and only to print from a physical printer.

Extension
All files encrypted by LockBit have the file extinction .lockbit after
calling NtCreateFile and NtWriteFile resolves \Registry\Machine\Software\Classes\.lockbit stack
string and calls NTCreateKey to create the registry extension, this is done after formatting
using its public key.

File Encryption
Prior to encryption LockBit will enumerate all volumes on the target system
using FindFirstVolumeW and FindNextVolumeW and proceeds to retrieve a list of Drive
letters and any mounted folder paths. Then each drive path is iterated from Z to A before
being mounted to a specific drive letter by calling SetVolumeMountPointW. Libsodium
Cryptography is used for the public key crypto using functions bcrypt.dll and LoadLibraryA, it
will use BCryptGenRandom for the RNG function or CryptGenRandom. Next, as seen
before the stack string is resolved and the public key is used to format it which is later used
as a Registry key to store the victim crypto keys. The malware calls
Libsodium crypto_box_keypair to generate a random 32-bit private key and the
corresponding public key. Next it will encrypt the 64-bit buffer containing both keys using
Libsodium crypto_box_easy then deletes the victims private key from memory.

13/17

After setting up the crypto keys, LockBit initialises its multithreading method we reference
earlier it then traverses through all local drives using techniques to skip drives that are not
available, or that have already been encrypted. Files that are recognised as read-only
changes the attribute to FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL making it writable and available for
encryption. The files are encrypted using 512 byte chunks and given the extension .lockbit
Again calling the RNG function the malware randomly generates a 16-byte AES key and 16byte AES IV and writes into the file structure before renaming the file before the encryption
by populating a FILE_NAME_INFORMATION with the encrypted file name before
calling NTSetInformationFile with the information class FileNameInformation. In the final
stages LockBit will create threads to traverse and encrypt other network hosts and network
drives by using the GetAdaptorInfo the inet_addr call is made to convert the system IP
address and mask. Once the broadcast domain is identified LockBit will scan the network
iterating from the network ID address and incrementing up to the broadcast address trying to
connect over ports 135 or 445, if successful it will try to encrypt the network hosts.
