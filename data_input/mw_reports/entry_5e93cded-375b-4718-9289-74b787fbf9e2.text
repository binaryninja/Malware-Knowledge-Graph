Banatrix – an indepth look
cert.pl/en/news/single/banatrix-an-indepth-look/

Of all of the Polish malware families that we have seen last year,
Banatrix seems to be the most technologically advanced one. This
malware was used to replace the bank account number in the browser
memory, however its implementation allowed an attacker to execute any
arbitrary code on the victim’s machine. This was used to extract
passwords saved in the Mozilla Firefox browser. On this article we
discuss the Banatrix C&C infrastructure and its use of TOR network both
to hide the attacker’s identity and to make the botnet takedown a
challenge.

What Banatrix does to the infected machine?
As we have described in our previous article Banatrix was used to replace the victim’s bank
account number in the browser memory. However, its architecture allows for a lot more. The
general concept behind this malware is presented in the picture below.

First stage: unpacking and persistence
Upon the first run malware drops two files: xor encrypted DLL and an exe file. This files are
created in the
<span class="text">%AppData%</span>
directory (which is
<span class="text">C:\Users\All Users</span>
on Windows XP and

<span class="text">C:\ProgramData</span>
on Windows Vista and newer). Encrypted DLL is saved either as
<span class="text">.sys</span>
or as
<span class="text">.windows.sys</span>
. Exe file (named
<span class="text">wms.exe</span>
or
<span class="text">wmc.exe</span>
) is added to the system as a Scheduled Task. The library file is decrypted and loaded into
the process memory. It is then encrypted again, using a different, random key and saved with
that key to the same file. This results in a different file every time the malware runs.
Second stage: network communication
The library, decrypted and loaded to the process memory, is responsible for communication
with the C&C proxy. This includes downloading additional malicious code that is run on the
infected machine. The first step in this communication is sending the RSA-encrypted
machine configuration details, like the computer and user name, OS version or language.
The new version of Banatrix uses a TOR proxy server to communicate with the real C&C.
This is done using a custom proxy protocol. The malware contacts the hardcoded domain in
one of the several TLDs, where the attacker set up a TOR proxy server. It then sends the
<span class="text">.onion</span>
domain (along with some other data) to this proxy server and the server connects with that
domain.
This real C&C then sends a xor-encrypted library, which is run on the infected machine. This
library is again loaded into the process memory and the exported function called
<span class="text">init</span>
is run. This, of course, allows the attacker to execute any code on the infected machine. This
is also how the updates are being delivered.

The newest Banatrix version contains a DGA – algorithm responsible for creation of the
domain names. However, it is somewhat different from the DGA in the other malware
families. Banatrix has a list of domains in 25 different TLDs. Every one of these domains is
then used to create 4 different domain names and perform DNS queries on each one.
However only the fourth (last) domain will be used as a proxy C&C server – all others are
simply there to confuse the researchers. Part of the decompiled DGA is presented in the
screenshot below.

Third stage: code execution
The downloaded library, as we have mentioned previously, iterates over all of the processes
in the search of the browser process. It then searches the process memory for the bank
account number and replaces it with the hardcoded one. However, we have also observed
that some of the victims received another library – one that had a function to get the user
passwords saved in the Mozilla Firefox browser and send them to the dropzone server. This
proves that the malware architecture allows the flexibility to execute any arbitrary code.

Summary
Banatrix remains a serious threat for the Polish Internet users. This claim is backed up by
our sinkhole data – a little over 5,000 different IPs are trying to connect with the C&C server
every day. It seems that the malware is also under a heavy development and new features
are added every couple of weeks.
The SHA256 fingerprint of the analyzed sample is:
7c4d4e98601b2ae11c4a27299ded2a15e635b317ef32f48f683da016ca77c1c9. It’s has a
pretty high detection rate on VirusTotal, as you can see below.
