Taiwan Presidential Election: A Case Study on Thematic Targeting
17 March 2016
By Michael Yip
@michael_yip
Executive Summary
In January 2016, Tsai Ing­wen was elected as the first female president of Taiwan. Prior to the election, it was reported that the election was going to
be the target of a series of attacks by Chinese threat actors.[1] Looking back on the malware observed from different groups over that period of time,
we have been able to piece together evidence which suggests that several distinct threat actors launched attacks using the Taiwan presidential election
as a spear phishing theme. This blog post provides an overview of the malware and the network infrastructure associated with the threat actors who
have taken advantage of this event.
EvilGrab
The first sample we came across using the Taiwan election theme was an Excel spreadsheet named 2016年台灣總統選舉觀戰團 行程
20160105.xls (393dafa8bd5e30334d2cbf23677e1d2e).Once the spreadsheet is executed, a file called 6EC5.tmpis dropped in the
%temp%folder. The file is in fact an executable binary which, once executed, spawns a ctfmon.exe process and clones itself in the
%userprofile%directory as a file called IEChecker.exe (fb498e6a994d6d53b80c53a05fc2da36).

Figure 1: ctfmon.exeprocess creates a set of registry keys and drops IEChecker.exein %userprofile%.

Figure 2: Registry values containing encoded modules used by the Evilgrab malware.
Aside from creating IEChecker.exe, the malicious ctfmonprocess also creates a set of registry keys at the following paths which contain
encoded data. These are in fact modules used by the malware and this behavior shows that the malware analysed is an EvilGrab sample[2]:
HKCU\Software\rar\e
HKCU\Software\rar\s
HKCU\Software\rar\data
HKCU\Software\rar\ActiveSettings
HKCU\Software\Classes\VirtualStore\MACHINE\Software\rar\e
The malware establishes persistence by setting an Autorun key called ctfmonto ensure IEChecker.exeis executed on startup.

Figure 3: An AutoRun key is set by the ctfmon process to ensure IEChecker.exe is executed on startup.
The malware also beacons to the command and control (C2) 192.225.226[.]98on port 8080 by sending TCP SYN packets approximately
every 30 seconds.
DynCalc/Numbered Panda/APT12
The second sample we came across was an executable named 總統辯論會後：民眾政黨支持趨勢變化.exe
(791931e779a1af6d2e1370e952451aea) which translates to “Post presidential debate: support for people’s political parties changes”. The
sample was submitted to VirusTotal by a user in Taiwan on 11th January 2016, five days before the presidential election.

Figure 4: Malware was submitted to Virustotal on 11th January 2016 by a user in Taiwan.
The binary uses the standard Microsoft Word icon, shown below, to trick users into thinking the file is a legitimate Microsoft Word Document.

Figure 5: The malicious binary with a Word icon.
On execution, the binary creates a file called ka4281x3.login the same directory as the original binary; this file contains encoded data. The
naming convention of this file has been reported as distinctive to the IXESHE[3] and the related Etumbot[4] malware family, and it is based on the
behavioral similarity with other Etumbot samples (e.g. 2b3a8734a57604e98e6c996f94776086) that we believe this attack is associated with
APT12.
Aside from the .logfile, a decoy document is also created and displayed to the victim as shown below. Research on the content of the decoy
document shows that the content is likely to have been taken from a presentation with
the same title, “總統辯論會後：民眾政黨支持趨勢變化”, originally written by TaiwanThinkTank.[5] The figure below shows the same content
from the presentation being used in the decoy document. The lack of formatting in the decoy document suggests that the attacker simply copied and
pasted the content from the PDF to create a new Word document. The similarity of the content is as shown below:

Figure 6: The original presentation from the Taiwan Thinktank[6] titled “總統辯論會後：民眾政黨支持趨勢變化” with a slide showing the
results from the latest opinion poll (left) and the decoy document dropped by the IXESHE/Etumbot sample (right).
The malware then drops a binary called vecome.exeinto %Appdata%\Roaming\Locationand installs an Autorun key to ensure the dropped
binary is executed on startup.

Figure 7: An Autorun key is installed to ensure vecome.exe is executed on startup.

Similar to other IXESHE/Etumbot samples, the malware drops six temporary files in the %temp% folder:

The malware communicates with the C2 201.21.94[.]135on port 443 over SSL. The SSL certificate used is associated with the email address
exam@google.com[7] and has the serial 00 8b be a3 a0 a9 1b 1c 78.

certification is associated with the email address exam@google.com.
SunOrcal and Surtr
The last sample we have identified using the Taiwan election theme was a malicious Microsoft Word document named 2016總統選舉民情中心預測
值.doc (09ddd70517cb48a46d9f93644b29c72f). The content of this file contains two blank squares (Figure 10) however, once a self­
extracting archive (SFX) is dropped, a separate decoy document is displayed which contains one line of text that mentions the presidential election.

Figure 10: The malicious document used to drop a self­extracting archive in %temp%(top) and the subsequent decoy document displayed to
the victim (bottom).
However, the sentence is nonsensical and it reads as if the attacker simply concatenated a few unrelated lines together. Interestingly, a search for the
sentences revealed that it had been used as the title of a spear phishing email sent to a number of politicians and activists in Hong Kong including
James To[8], Tommy Cheung[9] and Joshua Wong.[10] Wong is a well­known student activist in Hong Kong and he publicly announced on
Facebook on 6th January 2016 that he had received the spear phishing email but was not tricked into opening the .rar attachment (Figure 11), which
shares the same filename as the document file referenced in Figure 10.

Figure 11: A well­known student activist in Hong Kong claimed to have received a spear phishing email with an attachment named “2016總

4/3/2016
Taiwan Presidential Election: A Case Study on Thematic Targeting - Cyber security updates
統選舉民情中心預測值.rar”. The email title is identical to the line shown in the decoy document dropped by the analysed sample.

Examining the EXIF data of the decoy document dropped by our sample shows that the document was created on the same day as the spear phishing
email was sent.

Figure 12: EXIF data of the decoy document highlight the similarity in timing of the attack.
Given similarities in the theme and text used in the spear phish, as well as the timing of the campaign against the Hong Kong activist and the creation
time of the decoy document, we believe both attacks are likely to be the same.
Returning to the analysis of our sample, once the lure document is executed, a self­extracting archive is dropped and executed. The archive contains
three files, a batch script, a copy of the wget binary and a further binary called iuso.exe.

Figure 13: The dropped self­extracting archive.
Once executed, the binaries are dropped in the %programdata%directory and the batch script is executed to download the second stage malware
from a compromised host kcico[.]com.

Figure 14: Batch script used to download the malware from a compromised website.
The downloaded binary wthk.exeis then executed and two new nested directories are generated in %programdata%: “Javame” and “sun
orcal”. Based on the use of this unique folder name “sun orcal” which dates back to as early as 2013[11] and which appears to be a misspelling
of Sun Oracle, we refer to this malware as SunOrcal.
Below are the full nested paths:
C:\ProgramData\Javame\Java\Jre\helper\113507
C:\ProgramData\sun orcal\java\JavaUpdata
C:\ProgramData\sun orcal\java\SunJavaUpdata
Once wthk.exeis executed, it clones itself to \sun orcal\java\SunJavaUpdataas a file called SunJavaUpdata.exe. In addition, a
shortcut called SunJavaUpdataData.lnkis created in the Javamefolder which points to the malware SunJavaUpdata.exe.
The purpose of this shortcut became clear when we examined the changes made to the registry. The malware modifies the startupkey at
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folder\to point to the
\Javame\Java\Jre\helper\113507directory, causing Explorer to execute the shortcut when it first loads and which in effect ensures the
malware is executed on startup.

Figure 15:
SunOrcal persistence mechanism.

As shown in the batch script, once wthk.exehas finished executing, iuso.exeis then executed. Examining the code of this binary shows that
the sole purpose of this binary is to sleep for one minute and then execute a binary in %programdata%called Keyainst.exe. Unfortunately, we
were unable to retrieve this binary.
Examining the network traffic generated by SunJavaUpdata.exe, we find that the malware communicates with the C2 domain
safety.security­centers[.]comwhich resolved to the IP address 210.61.12[.]153at
the time of writing. According to DomainTools[12], the domain security­centers[.]comis associated with two email addresses:
Registrant email: an_ardyth@123mail.org
Admin/tech email: janmiller­domain@googlemail.com
Interestingly, the malware stores the C2 in the registry key at HKCU\Software\Google\info:

Figure
16: C2 information and campaign code stored in registry.

The figure also shows what appears to be a campaign code “wthkdoc0106” with “wthk” being the malware name, “doc” being the type of
document used for malware delivery and “0106” denoting 6th January which is the date of the attack, as shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12.
Aside from the campaign code, the malware also has a hardcoded mutex “M&BX^DSF&DA@F”:

Figure 17: Hardcoded mutex M&BX^DSF&DA@F.

Another interesting observable from the malware sample is a call to a DLL function, FunctionWork, which is hardcoded in the malware.

Figure 18: SunOrcal malware calls a function called FunctionWorkwhich is hardcoded in the malware.

Although we were unable to find direct overlap in network infrastructure used by our SunOrcal sample and other threat actors, we were able to
identify other SunOrcal samples which have shared network infrastructure with the Surtr malware, previously reported by Citizen Labs[13] back in
2013.
In particular, by finding samples that create the same folder names “javame” and “sun orcal”, we came across the following SunOrcal samples
which shares the same mutex, folder structure, registry paths and calls the DLL function “FunctionWork”:
6b3804bf4a75f77fec98aeb50ab24746(C2: www.olinaodi[.]com)
1fd33fe7c2800225bfc270f9ae053b65 (C2: www.eyesfeel256[.]com)
397021af7c0284c28db65297a6711235 (C2: safetyssl.security­centers[.]com)
415f5752bf5182b9d108d7478ba950f9 (C2: www.eyesfeel256[.]com)
Looking at the WHOIS information of olinaodi[.]comand eyesfeel256[.]comshow that they are registered with the same email address
toucan6712@163.com. A reverse WHOIS lookup on the email address returned a total of fourteen domains, the majority of which follow related
themes such as fly, dream, eyes and feel.
Particularly interesting is flyoutside[.]comwhich was reported by Citizen Lab in 2013 as a C2 domain associated with the Surtr malware. The
Surtr samples associated with this C2 are:

Figure
19: List of domains registered using the email address toucan6712@163.com.
Based on the use of the same registrant email address that is associated with only a small number of domains with related themes in addition to the
targeting of Tibet and Hong Kong, both of which are autonomous regions that have been problematic to China’s internal security, we believe with
high confidence that both SunOrcal and Surtr RATs are used by the same threat actor. Based on the creation date of some of the domains, we believe
the threat actor has been active as early as 2010.
Conclusion
Spear phishing has long been one of the most common and effective ways in which an attacker can deliver malware on to victim machines to
compromise target organisations. The success or failure of this technique relies on the ability of attackers to trick victims into opening the malicious
attachment and this is why high­profile events and headlines are often used as lures.
As with other high­profile events, the Taiwanese presidential election in January was no different. In this blog post, we have shown that three distinct
espionage threat actors have used the election as theme to lure their victims into opening the malicious documents. This highlights the importance of
security awareness training to ensure staff members, particularly those with access to sensitive information, remain vigilant in order to help defend
against well­crafted spear­phishing attacks.
