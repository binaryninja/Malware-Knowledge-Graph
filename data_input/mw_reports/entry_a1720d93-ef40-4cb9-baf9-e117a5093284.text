A few months ago, we blogged about malicious extensions redirecting users to phishing sites
and inserting affiliate IDs into cookies of eCommerce sites. Since that time, we have
investigated several other malicious extensions and discovered 5 extensions with a total
install base of over 1,400,000

1/18

The extensions offer various functions such as enabling users to watch Netflix shows
together, website coupons, and taking screenshots of a website. The latter borrows several
phrases from another popular extension called GoFullPage

Apart from offering the intended functionality, the extensions also track the user’s browsing
activity. Every website visited is sent to servers owned by the extension creator. They do this
so that they can insert code into eCommerce websites being visited. This action modifies the
2/18

cookies on the site so that the extension authors receive affiliate payment for any items
purchased.
The users of the extensions are unaware of this functionality and the privacy risk of every
site being visited being sent to the servers of the extension authors.

Technical Analysis
This section contains the technical analysis of the malicious chrome extension
‘mmnbenehknklpbendgmgngeaignppnbe’. All 5 extensions perform similar behavior.

Manifest.json

3/18

The manifest.json sets the background page as bg.html. This HTML file loads b0.js and this
is responsible for sending the URL being visited and injecting code into the eCommerce
sites.

B0.js
The b0.js script contains many functions. This blog will focus on the functions which are
responsible for sending the visited URLs to the server and processing the response.
Chrome extensions work by subscribing to events which they then use as triggers to perform
a certain activity. The extensions analyzed subscribe to events coming from
chrome.tabs.onUpdated. chrome.tabs.onUpdated will trigger when a user navigates to a new
URL within a tab.

4/18

Once this event triggers, the extension will set a variable called curl with the URL of the tab
by using the tab.url variable. It creates several other variables which are then sent to
d.langhort.com. The POST data is in the following format:

Variable

Description

Ref

Base64 encoded referral URL

County

The county of the device

City

The city of the device

Zip

The zip code of the device

Apisend

A random ID generated for the user.

Name

Base64 encoded URL being visited

ext_name

The name of the chrome extensions

The random ID is created by selecting 8 random characters in a character set. The code is
shown below:

5/18

The country, city, and zip are gathered using ip-api.com. The code is shown below:

Upon receiving the URL, langhort.com will check if it matches a list of websites that it has an
affiliate ID for, and If it does, it will respond to the query. An example of this is shown below:

The data returned is in JSON format. The response is checked using the function below and
will invoke further functions depending on what the response contains.

6/18

Two of the functions are detailed below:

Result[‘c’] – passf_url
If the result is ‘c’ such as the one in this blog, the extension will query the returned URL. It
will then check the response and if the status is 200 or 404, it will check if the query
responded with a URL. If it did, it would insert the URL that is received from the server as an
Iframe on the website being visited.

Result[‘e’] setCookie
If the result is ‘e’, the extension would insert the result as a cookie. We were unable to find a
response of ‘e’ during our analysis, but this would enable the authors to add any cookie to
any website as the extensions had the correct ‘cookie’ permissions.

7/18

Behavioral flow
The images below show the step-by-step flow of events while navigating to the BestBuy
website.

8/18

1. The user navigates to bestbuy.com and the extension posts this URL in a Base64
format to d.langhort.com/chrome/TrackData/
2. Langhort.com responds with “c” and the URL. The “c” means the extension will invoke
the function passf_url()
3. passf_url() will perform a request against the URL
4. the URL queried in step 3 is redirected using a 301 response to bestbuy.com with an
affiliate ID associated with the Extension owners
5. The extension will insert the URL as an Iframe in the bestbuy.com site being visited by
the user
6. Shows the Cookie being set for the Affiliate ID associated with the Extension owners.
They will now receive a commission for any purchases made on bestbuy.com

Time delay to avoid automated analysis
We discovered an interesting trick in a few of the extensions that would prevent malicious
activity from being identified in automated analysis environments. They contained a time
check before they would perform any malicious activity. This was done by checking if the
current date is > 15 days from the time of installation.

Conclusion
This blog highlights the risk of installing extensions, even those that have a large install base
as they can still contain malicious code.
McAfee advises its customers to be cautious when installing Chrome extensions and pay
attention to the permissions that they are requesting.

11/18

The permissions will be shown by Chrome before the installation of the extension.
Customers should take extra steps to verify the authenticity if the extension is requesting
permissions that enable it to run on every website you visit such as the one detailed in this
blog

McAfee customers are protected against the malicious sites detailed in this blog as they are
blocked with McAfee WebAdvisor as shown below.

The Malicious code within the extension is detected as JTI/Suspect. Please perform a ‘Full’
