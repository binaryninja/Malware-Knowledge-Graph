ICS SECURITY:
2017 IN REVIEW

INTRODUCTION
Manufacturing facilities and critical infrastructure, such as energy and transportation, have fallen
victim to more and more cyberattacks in recent years. Loss of USD $300 million by shipping giant
Maersk,1 interruptions in production at Renault and Nissan plants,2 and a ransomware attack on
the San Francisco public transit system3 are only a few recent examples that have made headlines.
Securing industrial control systems (ICS) is a critical factor in ensuring the overall information security of critical facilities and infrastructure. Many efforts have been made to promote ICS security: governments are developing regulatory frameworks, computer emergency response teams
(CERT) are issuing bulletins, and ICS vendors are gaining awareness that vulnerabilities in their
products can cause loss of lucrative contracts4 and even lives.
Despite these efforts—and in the face of mounting incident costs and concern—security at most
industrial facilities has shown minimal improvement since the Stuxnet attacks of 2010, as illustrated in this report.
The problem is worsened by the tendency to connect ICS equipment to the Internet, which is
likely to intensify with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Such connections set the
stage for attacks by hackers from anywhere in the world, even without direct physical access to
target equipment.
Nowadays, almost any advanced Internet user can look up the IP addresses of network equipment
used on ICS networks (such as switches, interface converters, and gateways) with the help of publicly available search engines. When this equipment is hacked, building systems and operations
are at high risk. In 2017, we found that vulnerabilities in such equipment are becoming an increasingly common occurrence.5
This report, our fourth on the subject, describes findings by Positive Technologies regarding vulnerabilities in ICS components and their prevalence on Internet-connected systems, and how this
situation has evolved over recent years.

ICS SECURITY:
2017 IN REVIEW

VULNERABILITIES IN ICS COMPONENTS
Research methodology
Information was drawn from publicly available sources, such as vulnerability knowledge bases,
vendor advisories, exploit databases and packs, research papers, and posts on security websites
and blogs.6
The following vulnerability knowledge bases were used:
+
+
+
+
+

ICS-CERT (ics-cert.us-cert.gov)
NVD (nvd.nist.gov), CVE (cve.mitre.org)
Positive Research Center (securitylab.ru/lab)
Schneider Electric Cybersecurity Support Portal7
Siemens Product CERT (siemens.com/cert)

The severity of vulnerabilities in ICS components was assessed based on the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS) version 3 (first.org/cvss).
Our assessment of disclosed vulnerabilities did not attempt to cover every single vendor of industrial automation equipment, instead focusing on larger and more prominent companies.

Trends
The number of new vulnerabilities disclosed in 2017 increased compared to the prior year. As of
publication of this report, information about 197 vulnerabilities of major manufacturers had been
published. However, this number could still increase due to responsible disclosure policies, since
vulnerabilities often are not published until after they have been fixed. For example, 30 vulnerabilities in Moxa equipment were detected in 2016 but disclosed only in 2017.

INTERNET ACCESSIBILITY OF ICS COMPONENTS
Research methodology
To collect information on the online accessibility of ICS components, Positive Technologies used
passive methods only. To obtain the research materials, we scanned ports of Internet-accessible
components using publicly accessible search engines: Google, Shodan (shodan.io), and Censys
(censys.io).
Passive techniques for gathering data about the Internet accessibility of ICS components have
several limitations:
+

Shodan scans a limited number of ports and performs scanning of the Internet from specific IP
addresses, which are blacklisted by some firewall vendors and administrators. Therefore, data
from Google and Censys was used to expand the scope of assessment.

+

In many cases, it was not possible to determine product versions, because the necessary information was not given in the banners returned by host servers.

This data was then specially analyzed to identify which results corresponded to ICS equipment.
Our experts created a database of ICS identifiers for determining product and vendor based on a
device’s banner.

Prevalence
The research revealed 175,632 ICS components accessible online.
Looking at the protocols used by the detected ICS components, the most common protocol was
HTTP, which is consistent with recent years. The Fox protocol was also very popular: it is used
in Niagara Framework products and most commonly seen in automation systems for buildings,
facilities, and data centers. These systems control air conditioning, power supply, telecommunications, alarms, lighting, security cameras, and other important building systems. Such automation
systems often contain vulnerabilities9 and have already been attacked in the wild.10

Statistics: vendors and products
First place is occupied by Honeywell, the owner of Tridium and Niagara Framework. Some Niagara
products retain their old brand, which is why Tridium is listed separately from Honeywell in this
report.
The second most popular vendor is Lantronix. This California-based company manufactures devices designed to provide remote access to equipment via the Internet.

Number of Internet-accessible ICS components, by vendor

According to recent research,11 several thousand Lantronix interface converters are accessible on
the Internet. Almost half of these devices expose passwords that could be used to connect via
Telnet. Our research confirms this fact: we detected 12,120 accessible Lantronix devices in total, a
number of which were vulnerable.
Despite their auxiliary role, these devices can pose a significant hazard to operations when connected to the Internet. Interface converters connect ICS components to each other, so any malfunction
or failure on their part can cause loss of remote control and management. For example, during a cyberattack on the Ukrainian energy grid,12 the attackers remotely disrupted the functioning of Moxa
converters. As a result, utility operators could no longer connect to field devices at substations or
remotely control substation switches.
As in prior years, Niagara Framework is the software most commonly found on Internet-accessible
equipment. Apart from Lantronix interface converters, which hold second place, Moxa converters
are also close to the top.

ICS SECURITY:
2017 IN REVIEW

CONCLUSION
The 2017 data shows an increasing number of vulnerabilities publicly acknowledged by major ICS
vendors. More than half of the detected vulnerabilities are of critical or high severity.
The number of Internet-accessible ICS components is growing. The majority of them were detected in the countries with the highest levels of industrial automation (U.S., Germany, France, Canada,
Italy, and China).
An increase in the number of known vulnerabilities and Internet-accessible ICS components allows
attackers to conduct a wider range of attacks, which can cause very tangible impacts. Responding
to sophisticated attacks on ICS components requires large amounts of preparation and planning.
Before the first line of code is ever written, ICS developers must design the security mechanisms
necessary to protect ICS components from attacks.
To identify potential attack vectors and develop an effective protection system, companies should
perform regular ICS security audits and deploy industrial cybersecurity incident management
solutions.
As always, observing the following basic security guidelines goes a long way toward ensuring
protection:
+
+
+
+
+
+
+
+

Segregate ICS operational networks from the enterprise LAN and external networks.
Limit physical access to ICS networks and components.
Enforce a strict password policy.
Properly configure network equipment and firewall filtering rules.
Protect privileged accounts.
Minimize privileges of users and services.
Use antivirus software.
Regularly install updates to operating systems and applications.
