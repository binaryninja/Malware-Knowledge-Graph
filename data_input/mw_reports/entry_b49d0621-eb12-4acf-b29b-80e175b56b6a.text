ABSTRACT
Traditionally, the primary focus of the chemical industry has
been safety and productivity. However, recent threats to our
nation’s critical infrastructure have prompted a tightening of
security measures across many different industry sectors.
Reducing control system vulnerabilities against physical and cyber
attack is necessary to ensure the safety, reliability, integrity and
availability of these systems. The U.S. Department of Homeland
Security has developed a strategy to secure these vulnerabilities.
Crucial to this strategy is the Control Systems Security and Test
Center (CSSTC) established to test and analyze control systems
and their components. In addition, the CSSTC promotes a
proactive, collaborative approach to increase industry’s
awareness of standards, products and processes that can enhance
the security of control systems. This paper outlines measures that
can be taken to enhance the cybersecurity of process control
systems in the chemical sector.

INTRODUCTION

Evidences of safe working environments and practices and secure working places are
found in almost every chemical plant. The evidence for cybersecurity is not as readily
apparent. However, keeping computers and networks free from viruses and hackers (and
available for productive use) is just as important as keeping thieves and terrorists out of
the plant. The purpose of this paper is to establish the need for cybersecurity for the
chemical industry and to identify the common vulnerabilities of control systems.

DISCUSSION

The Safety Mind-Frame

Security, like safety, must be an integral part of any chemical process. Operating
procedures are developed with the safety of workers, the public, and our environment in
mind. Equipment is designed with safety in mind. The proper protective equipment is
worn with safety in mind. Physical security surrounds the chemical plant. “Guards,
gates and guns” are used to ensure the environment is safe for the workers. It protects the
documents and processes that are business sensitive and classified. The right people are
let through the guard gate and the wrong people are kept out.
Both physical security and cybersecurity are put in place with safety in mind.
cybersecurity protects control systems to keep the chemical processes working safely and
efficiently. It ensures the data are not compromised. It keeps the computer viruses,
worms, Trojans, etc. from infecting the computers on the network and from affecting the
control systems. It lets the right people access the controls and information, and keeps
the wrong people off the controls denying them access to sensitive and proprietary
information and out of the network.
Cybersecurity – Is the Threat Real?
Cybersecurity threats are real and they happen every day to people in all walks of life.
With the modernization of control system equipment more systems are interconnected
and more importantly, more systems are linked at some level to the internet. With each
additional connection comes one more doorway by which a hacker, curious or malicious,
can enter. Additionally the control system networks are becoming more public.
Operations within a chemical or electrical have traditionally been closed and little was
known about them to the outsider. Last year at one of the principle cyber forums in this
country, a hacker gave a presentation on control systems. Interest and curiosity is rising
along with the visibility.
Cyber attacks can slow the computer’s response and the networks speed or bring
everything to a complete halt, causing a denial of service. Cyber attacks can also cause
unwanted and unexpected results. In the world of chemical processing where efficiency
is critical to making a profit, an undetected cyber attack can slow the process and reduce
the efficiency of the plant. An article from the Rand Corporation stated, “Attacks in
cyberspace blur traditional boundaries between nations and private interests, cannot be
foreseen or tracked via classical intelligence methods, and are all but indistinguishable
from accidents, system failures or even hacker pranks.”1 The critical infrastructure of the
United States provides many lucrative targets.
A well known example of a cyber attack that had disastrous results occurred in
Australia. A contractor who had been instrumental in installing the network for a waste
management company “caused millions of litres of raw sewage to spill out into local
parks, rivers and even the grounds of a Hyatt Regency hotel. . . Marine life died, the
creek water turned black and the stench was unbearable for residents.”2 A series of cyber
attacks had been occurring for at least 2 months before the waste management company
learned what was happening and identified the source of the trouble.
In January 2003, the slammer worm caused the Internet to slow down to a crawl. The
Bank of America reported “that customers at a majority of its 13,000 automatic teller
machines were unable to process customer transactions.”3 It is not hard to imagine how a

Chemical process could become paralyzed if a similar worm were to infect their network
system.
The CERT Coordination Center has kept statistics on the number of incidents that
have been reported to them between 1988 and 2003. The number of cybersecurity
incidents reported each year has been rising rapidly. In 1999, there were about 10,000
incidents reported. In 2003, there were almost 140,000 incidents reported. This
exponential increase in incidents demonstrates another interesting and important fact.
There are more and more people who are proliferating cyber attacks. As shown in Figure
1, the cyber attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated yet the average person’s
knowledge required to spawn an attack is actually being reduced. One of the major
reasons for this is because the internet has enabled hackers to share their experiences and
techniques and obtain tools. For example, a New Jersey man was charged with computer
criminal activity and attempted criminal activity for placing spyware on his landlord’s
computer to see how she was going to proceed collecting a $10,000 judgment from him.
A service provider verified that the spyware came from his email address. He is currently
out on $30,000 bail.4

Figure 1 – Intruder Knowledge vs. Attack Sophistication
Cyber threats are real. Cyber attacks come from a wide variety of sources including,
viruses/worms/trojans/etc, an insider or a disgruntled employee, neighborhood hackers,
industrial espionage, terrorists. Reconnaissance is typically a pre-cursor to an attack. All
of the above mentioned sources can cause problems with control systems. However,
some of these sources have the intent to create problems on a very large scale. Two
examples are note worthy. First, the Washington Times reported that “China is actively
developing options to create chaos on the island, to compromise components of Taiwan’s
critical infrastructure.”5 Then Media Corp News reported that “North Korea has trained
more than 500 computer hackers capable of launching cyber warfare against the United
States. . . The Military hackers had been put through a five-year university course

training them to penetrate the computer systems of South Korea, the United States and
Japan.”6
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has an objective to “create a
national-level capability to coordinate between government and industry to reduce
vulnerabilities and respond to the threats associated with the control systems that
comprise our National Critical Infrastructure.”7 The mission of the DHS National Cyber
Security Division is to be the focal point for addressing cyber security issues in the
United States.”8 In order to accomplish that mission, the DHS National Cyber Security
Division has established the Control System Security and Test Center (CSSTC). The
CSSTC is working to identify, analyze and eliminate vulnerabilities associated with the
control systems in critical infrastructure applications. A major effort is being made to
increase awareness of the need for cybersecurity and what to do to reduce vulnerabilities
in control systems.
Taking action to reduce or eliminate a vulnerability will reduce the probability of a
successful cyber attack. There are common things that any company can do to reduce the
vulnerabilities in their control system. Below are the top 10 vulnerabilities commonly
found within control systems.
Top 10 Vulnerabilities in Control Systems
10.

Insufficient network separation (protection) between corporate and realtime control systems. The corporate and process control networks should be
separated by a properly configured firewall. The architecture of the network
is essential to good cybersecurity. Figure 2 shows the recommended network
architecture.

Figure 2 – Recommended Network Architecture
9.

Security efforts focused solely on corporate internet interface point.
When the IT organization assumes that if the corporate network is protected
then the rest of the control system is protected it leaves the process control

network open for attack. Some of the best and most secure networks have
been compromised by an employee bringing in a laptop w/an embedded
Trojan or Worm, connecting to the production network and introducing the
malicious code. Therefore, practicing defense in depth is an essential
cybersecurity practice.
8.

Remote access to the process control LAN not properly secured. Many
control systems have modems or wireless access. These communication
points need to be secured with, for example, encryption or passwords.
Equipment vendors frequently leave open ports for remote maintenance of
equipment.

7.

Dual-Network cards installed and in use, bridging the two networks. If a
single computer has direct access to both the corporate and process control
networks through separate network cards, a hacker can bypass the firewall.
This can include remote communications when the remote user connects
through a commercial ISP service.

6.

Null-Session Authentication, shared folders, and “everyone” permissions
defeat any internal IT controls. Everyone needs to be trained on good
cybersecurity practices. These commonly found security “no-no’s” are
primarily used for exploiting a system once access is gained. The fewer
internal access controls are in place the easier it is for a successful penetration
to turn into a successful exploitation.

5.

Process LAN and associated systems easy to find by obvious PC name. If
a hacker can make it into the process control network, it only makes life easier
for them if they can easily recognize the names of the equipment,
instrumentation and controllers. There are many instances of people making
life easier by naming their systems with critical information, i.e., Firewall1,
Primary DNS, Historian or History1.

4.

No outbound filtering of data. Data needs to be filtered as it exits the
process control network as well as filtering the data stream as it enters. The
only way to know what is being transferred into and out of your network is to
look at the data. Know which systems should be talking to which systems and
look for anomalies.

3.

Workstations / Servers running process control applications not properly
patched. Nearly every critical exploit for the past several years has had an
existing patch. Patches are created by the vendor to make their system work
better and operate more securely. Keep your anti-virus software updated, too.
Patching in control systems is not easy. We must test, retest and then
carefully examine both the need and the net gain. If equal protection or
mitigation can be gained another way for the short term then use it while you
plan and patch.

2.

Policies either not in place, not followed, inadequate or not enforced
(password, backup/restore, etc…). Event the best training program and the
best network architecture will be defeated if the company policies are
inadequate or not enforced. Passwords have been found taped to the system,
under the keyboard, in a file on the system named “Passwords” or “psswd”
and even shared with coworkers.

1.

Social engineering (i.e., human factors) and physical security extremely
weak. Your friendly industrial espionage agent will tell you that a few secrets
learned through social engineering or by gaining access to the network system
will make the hackers’ job infinitely easier. An effective counterintelligence
or Operations Security program and strict adherence to policies and
procedures are essential.

3. CONCLUSION
Cybersecurity is critical to success in today’s business world. It helps defend against
cyber attack on control systems for both the casual and the malicious intruder as well as
industrial espionage. Cyber attacks are a reality in today’s world, and critical
infrastructures are increasingly the target. The number of cyber incidences and the
sophistication of the attacks have dramatically increased. Companies can defend
themselves against these attacks by reducing their process control network vulnerabilities
and following good security practices and procedures. Critical infrastructures, such as
the chemical industry, need to be proactive and protect their assets from potential cyber
attacks and to ensure the safety of workers, the public and our environment.
