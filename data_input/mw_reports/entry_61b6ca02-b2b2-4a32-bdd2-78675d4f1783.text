Warzone RAT is part of an APT campaign named “Confucius.” Confucius APT is known to
target government sectors of China and few other South Asian countries. This APT
campaign was quite active around January 2021. Warzone RAT first emerged in 2018 as
malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and is known for its aggressive use of “.docx” files as its initial
infection vector. The initial payload is known as “Ave Maria Stealer,” which can steal
credentials and log keystrokes on the victim’s machine. The advanced version of this
malware is currently sold in the underground market for $22.95 per month and $49.95 for
three months. The Warzone creators have an official website where it’s up for sale.

These are the various features of the RAT mentioned on the website:
Remote Desktop & Webcam
Privilege Escalation – UAC Bypass
Password Recovery
Download & Execute.
Live Keylogger
Remote Shell
Persistence
Windows Defender Bypass
We came across a cracked version of Warzone RAT on GitHub. Here is the screenshot of
that repository:

Based on our research, we confirmed that the threat actor is trying to circumvent attacks with
a decoy and manipulate users, delivering the next stage payload via template injection
technique. In this blog, we are going to talk about “.docx” used as an initial attack vector and
how it’s delivering its final payload -Warzone RAT.

Technical Analysis:

Figure 3: Attack Chain
The various phases of the attack are:
The victim opens the word document.
This document further downloads an RTF exploit (CVE-2017-11882).
Exploit in RTF is triggered and muka.dll is dropped and executed.
Muka.dll downloads Warzone RAT.
Phase 1:
Here the infection chain starts with a “.docx” file. We can see below the decoy document
(Hash: 59ccfff73bdb8567e7673a57b73f86fc082b0e4eeaa3faf7e92875c35bf4f62c). This
decoy document was crafted by attackers to induce the victims.

While executing, it uses the template injection technique to download the next stage RTF
exploit. This exploit delivers a dll embedded final payload that connects to the domain to
connect to the CNC to download payload Warzone Rat. We can see from the below image.

Figure 5: Using Template Injection Technique
The RTF exploit is downloaded through “\word\_rels\settings.xml.rels” file present in
document structure using template injection technique as shown below.

Phase 2:
The downloaded RTF file (Hash:
686847b331ace1b93b48528ba50507cbf0f9b59aef5b5f539a7d6f2246135424) contains code
that exploits an old vulnerability “CVE-2017-11882”. The flaw resides within equation editor
(EQNEDT32.exe), a component in Microsoft office that inserts or edits object linking and
embedding (OLE) Objects. We found that muka.dll is embedded in an OLE object.

Phase 3:
The embedded muka.dll file (Hash:
1c41a03c65108e0d965b250dc9b3388a267909df9f36c3fefffbd26d512a2126) contains export
function zenu and this dll is used to provide functionalities to other programs. Here is an
image showing this:

Phase 4:
Upon successful exploitation, the dll connects to a malicious domain (wordupdate.com)
which is active nowadays also and downloads the final warzone payload.

Figure 9: Requesting access to the malicious domain
The Warzone payload is saved as update.exe (Hash:
7dd1dba508f4b74d50a22f41f0efe3ff4bc30339e9eef45d390d32de2aa2ca2b).
Conclusion:

6/7

Warzone RAT exploits a pretty old but popular vulnerability, “CVE-2017-11882,” in Microsoft’s
equation editor component. This RAT works as an Info stealer malware. Attackers typically
spread such malware through document files as email attachments. We recommend our
customers not to access suspicious emails/attachments and keep their AV software up-todate to protect their systems from such complex malware. We detect the initial infection
vector as well as the final Warzone RAT as XML.Downloader.39387 and
Trojan.GenericRI.S16988580 respectively.
