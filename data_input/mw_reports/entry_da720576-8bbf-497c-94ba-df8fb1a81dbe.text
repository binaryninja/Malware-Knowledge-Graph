Carbanak Group Targets Executives of
Financial Organizations in the Middle East
March 14, 2016

Authors: Aleksey F, Darien Huss, Chris Wakelin, Chris I, and Proofpoint Staff

The Carbanak group is infamous for infiltrating various financial institutions, and stealing millions of dollars by learning and abusing the
internals of victim payment processing networks, ATM networks and transaction systems. Recently, we detected Carbanak campaigns
attempting to:
• Target high level executives in financial companies or in financial/decision-making roles in the Middle East, U.S. and Europe
• Spear-phishing emails delivering URLs, macro documents, exploit documents
• Use of Spy.Sekur (Carbanak malware) and commodity remote access Trojans (RATs) such as jRAT, Netwire, Cybergate and others
used in support of operations.

1.1 Campaign Targeting Middle East (URLs leading to Exploit Docs)
On March 1st 2016, Proofpoint detected a targeted email sent to hand-picked individuals working for banks, financial organizations,
and several professional service companies and companies selling enterprise software. These targets are high level executives and
decision makers such as directors, senior managers, regional/country managers, operations managers. The majority of targets work
in the Middle East region in countries such as UAE, Lebanon, Kuwait, Yemen and others.

The email contained a URL to a Microsoft Word document hosted on a compromised site churchmanarts[.]com. The document,
WRONG_AMOUN-01032016.doc (SHA256: ac63520803ce7f1343d4fa31588c1fef6abb0783980ad0ba613be749815c5900), exploits
CVE-2015-2545 when opened to drop and execute a downloader from the client’s temporary folder. This document drops essentially
the same payload every time, but slightly modified, possibly so that every execution results in a dropped file with a different hash.

Malware: Downloader and Sky.Sekur
After exploiting the vulnerability, the document drops the payload into %TMP%\1B9D.tmp (SHA256:
73259c6eacf212e22adb095647b6ae345d42552911ac93cdf81a3e2005763e74). This payload is a downloader (MSIL/JScript), a MSIL
packed executable (PE) that utilizes the Microsoft JScript library to retrieve the hardcoded HTTP location (Figure 4) and then executes
the downloaded payload using WScript.Shell. In this case it retrieved the second-stage payload Spy.Sekur from hxxp://78.128.92[.]49/
blesx.exe (SHA256: 04e86912d195d9189e64d1ce80374bed3073b0fcb731f3f403822a510e76ebaa).

Blesx.exe is a NSIS self-extracting installer. It is signed with a SHA1 digest Time Doctor LLC certificate, serial number 56:0E:89:8E:A6:
CE:12:B2:62:57:40:32:80:76:DC:FB and a SHA256 digest Tragon Corporation certificate, serial number 00:C3:A9:04:56:84:D2:9E:75.
The excerpt from the extracted NSIS script shown in Figure 6 depicts the basic functionality of this Carbanak/Spy.Sekur dropper.
The filenames of the payloads contained in the NSIS-installer are shown in lines 215, 216, 217 and 221 from the NSIS script excerpt
(described in Table 1).

The basic functionality of the NSIS installer begins first with System.dll, which is used to execute stole.dll with the provided parameters
on line 220. Additional WinAPIs needed by stole.dll are decoded from the file FervencyPoseuseChitchat (Table 1). Next, the file “cyan
bl 4.ADO” is decoded using the key GurnardScapularyHydrograph provided by the NSIS script, resulting in a Carbanak/Spy.Sekur
payload (SHA256: 2a087005db13302e90156829ce2b03c01063e364da3e3db153e4f47d61038757). The decoding algorithm is almost
identical to Malwarebytes research3, however the prev_j value is instead initialized to “key[0] % keylen”.

Malware: Java-based RAT, jRAT
At the same time they were spreading Spy.Sekur, the attackers also sent emails (with some target overlap) containing
URLs linking to jRAT. The email contained a URL to a Java JAR file hosted on a compromised site damianroz[.]
com. The malware file, captioned_transactionutrno_fftt16044002829-dtd02032016imagejpg.jar (SHA256:
04281900f08d55a3adc80182419609faf4c49d260d18496ecb3d3b90caca0612) communicates to C&C address 185.29.9[.]16.

Figure 9: Excerpts from
decompiled jRAT code

This RAT gives the attacker the functionality to chat with the victim, manage files (copy, create, delete, download, get dride listing,
move, rename, run), keylogger, manage processes (kill, create), monitor clipboard, monitor webcam by taking images and capture,
record sound, reboot, shutdown, logoff, modify registry (read, delete, write keys), read hosts file, get the victim’s geographic location,
and other capabilities.
The following evidence enabled us to connect this RAT to same group distributing Spy.Sekur:
• Similarity in payload URLs. For example, the malicious URL in the email leading to Spy.Sekur is shown first and the malicious URL
leading to jRAT is shown below it:
hxxp://churchmanarts[.]com/googlesqlz/22t/download.php?file=[base64 string]
hxxp://damianroz[.]com/22t/download.php?file=[base64 string]
• Overlap in sender email addresses
• The jRAT C&C IP address, 185.29.9[.]16 was observed as the first one to download the malicious document from churchmanarts[.]
com. We believe that 185.29.9[.]16 was under the control of the attacker and used as a proxy and C&C address.

1.2. Campaign Targeting U.S. and Europe (Macro Document Attachments)
On March 4th 2016, Proofpoint detected more targeted emails sent to individuals (as well as support and operational aliases) working
for financial industry, mass media, and other seemingly unrelated targets in fire, safety, air conditioning and heating. These individuals
all worked in financial and helpdesk roles such as account manager, credit controller, and IT support. Unlike the previously described
campaign, majority of targets work in U.S.- and Europe-based companies.

Figure 10: Example email sent in March 4th
campaign with subject “Balance Confirmation as
on March 05 2016”

Unlike the March 1st campaign, which contained links to exploit documents, this campaign employed documents attached to email
messages. The two observed documents “remitter request_2016-03-05-122839.doc” and “Reverse debit posted in Error 040316.doc”
use macros to download the final Spy.Sekur payload from hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exe.

Malware: Spy.Sekur
Once the user enables the malicious macros embedded in the document attachment, each document downloads Spy.Sekur payload
from hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exe (SHA256: 9758aa737004fc3fc6bc7d535e604324b6e42c7c19459f575083a411a4774b18). Unlike
the March 1st campaign, there is no separate downloader. As before, however, the payload is a NSIS-self extracting installer signed
with the same Time Doctor LLC and Tragon Corporation certificates.
Once installed and running, Spy.Sekur beacons to the same C&C server www[.]carenty44[.]net and IP address 78.128.92[.]29.
Similarly, in the custom TCP C&C beacon, the string “ArabLab0” can be observed; this is a hardcoded value possibly used as the
campaign identifier for these attacks.

Malware: Netwire
While we did not observe any emails attempting to infect
targets with Netwire in this campaign, we discovered
it hosted on hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/vex.exe (SHA256:
33808e7f7837323686c10c5da1e60812
afe041f28004ee667a5683a53532206c), which was also hosting
Spy.Sekur. We believe the Netwire may have been spread as a
part of the same campaign.
The following evidence enabled us to connect this Netwire
malware to the same group distributing Spy.Sekur:
Figure 13: Extracted Netwire configuration

• The payload IP address that hosted Spy.Sekur and Netwire at the same time
• hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/vex.exe (Netwire)
• hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exe (Spy.Sekur)
• The Netwire C&C IP address, 185.29.9[.]16, is once again the same IP that was used as C&C for the previously described jRAT and
observed downloading the malicious document from churchmanarts[.]com.

1.3 Regional Targeting Statistics
Analyzing a combination of logs (specifically, IP addresses downloading malicious documents, with our best effort to filter out security
researchers) and statistics on recipients of the malicious emails, we created a chart showing the targeted countries (Figure 15).
Targets in the U.S. heavily outweigh other countries due to the preponderance of financial organizations based. Organizations in
Middle Eastern countries such as Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and others were the next most-targeted.

Figure 15: Campaign targeting by country

2. Additional Carbanak Campaigns and Payloads
While searching for additional occurrences of the MSIL/JScript downloader, we uncovered an additional payload URL that was
rotated several times producing different payloads. As shown in the Maltego graph in Figure 14, several MSIL/JScript downloaders
were pointed at the URL: hxxp://172.98.202[.]171/famzy/final.exe. MorphineRAT, DarkComet, and most notably Spy.Sekur have been
observed being hosted at the URL (Table 2).

2.1. The “TUBOR0” Campaign
The Spy.Sekur (SHA256: 86c20c0e0417e73b51241a769164ddb33429a255f40e6bd1c86bed537b2eec1d) payload
contained the hardcoded identifier “TUBOR0”. We have observed additional samples using the same identifier,
including one (SHA256: 18f29f44d40846850a10f4eb5d217685e5853acababd08c7fdf4e3106452d33c) signed with
the same Time Doctor LLC certificate previously mentioned as well as a SHA256 digest MicroHealth certificate,
serial number 00:8F:3A:01:E1:C3:EE:AF:CC:BB:E6:22:95:50:7A:4E:20. An additional “TUBOR0” sample (SHA256:
390cffc97ad6982a3f7c7a1bbbc65bf2abf797267b134a58581b644cb5595f26) was found being dropped by a PowerPoint document
(SHA256: e8023e1362ee9240658565eabd18405e2694906a521377222984b82fdbb22714), likely exploiting CVE-204-6352. This sample
was not signed; however, it was configured to use the same C&C (www[.]googlesswe[.]com and 149.202.29[.]77) as the MicroHealth
signed Spy.Sekur. Furthermore, an “ArabLab0” sample was found hosted at hxxp://87[.]120[.]37[.]90/fend.png configured with the
same C&C as other “ArabLab0” samples, however neither a downloader or an email campaign has been discovered utilizing the fend.
png URL. The overlaps in the Spy.Sekur campaigns as well as the DarkComet and MorphineRAT activity are illustrated in the Maltego
graph in Figure 16.

2.2. MorphineRAT / DarkComet Connections
Finally, we researchers observed an email campaign utilizing a CVE-2015-2545 attachment (SHA256:a400ef9313199f5795de45cbe6e
31c4001c973e1c7fe9676bd5d301c977f8dac) whose payload was a MSIL/JScript Downloader (SHA256:cb6f847bcb8f585bc635157b5
906e2da423c04b862a5ee8036fb5dd2e1ce71a4) configured to download a final payload from hxxp://172.98.202[.]171/famzy/final.exe.
While the targeting for this campaign is not consistent with previous email campaigns that we have attributed to Carbanak, definite
similarities and overlap exist, including:
• CVE-2015-2545 exploit attachments with same metadata
• Exploit attachments delivering MSIL/JScript Downloader
• MSIL/JScript Downloader targets in both instances at some point were Spy.Sekur
Although none has been proven definitively at this time, we have several possible explanations for a connection between the
DarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actors:
• DarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actor(s) are employing the same payload delivery service.
• DarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actor(s) work closely together to achieve their goals (partnership, hired help, etc.).
• DarkComet/MorphineRAT activity is conducted by Carbanak actor(s) however the responsible operators are potentially functioning
with different goals in mind as illustrated by the wide range of targeted vertical industries.

2.3. Usage of Signed Payloads
As discussed above, numerous Spy.Sekur payloads have been signed using stolen or fraudulent certificates. In addition to Spy.Sekur,
these certificates have been used to sign many other samples belonging to different families, including various crypto ransomware
variants (Locky, TeslaCrypt, CryptoWall, Raas, Critroni), Neurevt, and Luminosity Link RAT. It is possible that the Carbanak actor(s) are
using signing certificates that are also made available to other groups and actors, therefore observing these certificates is not a strong
enough indicator for Carbanak activity.

2.4. An Even Older Campaign Delivering Toshliph & CyberGate
While this RAT was involved in a much older campaign than described in this document, we have previously observed
Toshliph (another malware in Carbanak arsenal) downloading Cybergate as a secondary payload. We include this information
here for completeness. On August 26, 2015, a document “Application form USD duplicate payment.doc” (SHA256:
a56c14acef1e0e2e262b5670e539c0008fdb785edf3e96ef285017894b598596) was sent as an email attachment to a list of individuals
working at U.S.-based financial organizations. It exploited CVE-2015-1770 and CVE-2015-1641 to drop Toshliph (SHA256:
bf4d24021fa5210eece4dffb7d1c53450c8401b319597669680d69617fa874ba). Toshliph (C2: 78.128.92[.]117) in turn downloaded
CyberGate (C2: 93.115.38[.]202). It should be noted that the C&C for this old Aug 2015 Toshliph campaign is in the same netblock as
the March 2016 Spy.Sekur campaigns.

Conclusion
The Carbanak group has been behind a number of attacks since 2013, most characterized by APT-style campaigns targeting multiple
groups with a variety of malware. In this case, we saw the group use new exploits, macro documents, and RATs to target new groups
outside their usual Russian domains. The group used attachment campaigns, URLs linking to exploit documents, and sophisticated
malware to go after targets in the US and Middle East. The group also expanded its targeting from financial institutions to seemingly
unrelated targets in fire, safety, and HVAC. However, as we learned from the Target data breach, among others, vendors and suppliers
can give attackers a point of entry into their real target.
