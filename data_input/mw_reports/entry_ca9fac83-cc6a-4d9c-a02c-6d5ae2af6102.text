Threat Actors Exploiting F5 BIG-IP CVE-2022-1388
SUMMARY
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) and the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis
Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity
Advisory (CSA) in response to active exploitation of CVE2022-1388. This recently disclosed vulnerability in certain
versions of F5 Networks, Inc., (F5) BIG-IP enables an
unauthenticated actor to gain control of affected systems
via the management port or self-IP addresses.

Actions for administrators to take
today:
• Do not expose management
interfaces to the internet.
• Enforce multi-factor
authentication.
• Consider using CISA’s Cyber
Hygiene Services.

F5 released a patch for CVE-2022-1388 on May 4, 2022,
and proof of concept (POC) exploits have since been
publicly released, enabling less sophisticated actors to exploit the vulnerability. Due to previous
exploitation of F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities, CISA and MS-ISAC assess unpatched F5 BIG-IP devices are
an attractive target; organizations that have not applied the patch are vulnerable to actors taking
control of their systems.
According to public reporting, there is active exploitation of this vulnerability, and CISA and MS-ISAC
expect to see widespread exploitation of unpatched F5 BIG-IP devices (mostly with publicly exposed
management ports or self IPs) in both government and private sector networks. CISA and MS-ISAC
strongly urge users and administrators to remain aware of the ramifications of exploitation and use
the recommendations in this CSA—including upgrading their software to fixed versions—to help
secure their organization’s systems against malicious cyber operations. Additionally, CISA and MSISAC strongly encourage administrators to deploy the signatures included in this CSA to help
determine whether their systems have been compromised. CISA and MS-ISAC especially encourage
organizations who did not patch immediately or whose F5 BIG-IP device management interface has
been exposed to the internet to assume compromise and hunt for malicious activity using the
detection signatures in this CSA. If potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the
incident response recommendations included in this CSA.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
CVE-2022-1388 is a critical iControl REST authentication bypass vulnerability affecting the following
versions of F5 BIG-IP:[1]
•
•
•
•
•

16.1.x versions prior to 16.1.2.2
15.1.x versions prior to 15.1.5.1
14.1.x versions prior to 14.1.4.6
13.1.x versions prior to 13.1.5
All 12.1.x and 11.6.x versions

An unauthenticated actor with network access to the BIG-IP system through the management port or
self IP addresses could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary system commands, create or
delete files, or disable services. F5 released a patch for CVE-2022-1388 for all affected versions—
except 12.1.x and 11.6.x versions—on May 4, 2022 (12.1.x and 11.6.x versions are end of life [EOL],
and F5 has stated they will not release patches).[2]
POC exploits for this vulnerability have been publicly released, and on May 11, 2022, CISA added
this vulnerability its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
Due to the POCs and ease of exploitation, CISA and MS-ISAC expect to see widespread exploitation
of unpatched F5 BIG-IP devices in government and private networks.

DETECTION METHODS
CISA recommends administrators, especially of organizations who did not immediately patch, to:
•
•
•

See the F5 Security Advisory K23605346 for indicators of compromise.
See the F5 guidance K11438344 if you suspect a compromise.
Deploy the following CISA-created Snort signature:
alert tcp any any -> any $HTTP_PORTS (msg:”BIG-IP F5 iControl:HTTP POST URI
‘/mgmt./tm/util/bash’ and content data ‘command’ and ‘utilCmdArgs’:CVE2022-1388”; sid:1; rev:1; flow:established,to_server;
flowbits:isnotset,bigip20221388.tagged; content:”POST”; http_method;
content:”/mgmt/tm/util/bash”; http_uri; content:”command”;

Additional resources to detect possible exploitation or compromise are identified below:
•

Emerging Threats suricata signatures. Note: CISA and MS-ISAC have verified these
signatures are successful in detection of both inbound exploitation attempts (SID: 2036546) as
well as post exploitation, indicating code execution (SID: 2036547).

INCIDENT RESPONSE
If an organization’s IT security personnel discover system compromise, CISA and MS-ISAC
recommend they:
Quarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts.
Reimage compromised hosts.
Provision new account credentials.
Limit access to the management interface to the fullest extent possible.
Collect and review artifacts such as running processes/services, unusual authentications,
and recent network connections.
6. Report the compromise to CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or
888-282-0870). State, local, tribal, or territorial government entities can also report to MSISAC (SOC@cisecurity.org or 866-787-4722).

See the joint CSA from the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious
Activity for additional guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in
incident handling. CISA and MS-ISAC also encourage government network administrators to see
CISA’s Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although
tailored to federal civilian branch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures for
planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail steps
for both incident and vulnerability response.

MITIGATIONS
CISA and MS-ISAC recommend organizations:
•
•

Upgrade F5 BIG-IP software to fixed versions; organizations using versions 12.1.x and 11.6.x
should upgrade to supported versions.
If unable to immediately patch, implement F5’s temporary workarounds:
o Block iControl REST access through the self IP address.
o Block iControl REST access through the management interface.
o Modify the BIG-IP httpd configuration.

See F5 Security Advisory K23605346 for more information on how to implement the above
workarounds.
CISA and MS-ISAC also recommend organizations apply the following best practices to reduce risk of
compromise:
•
•

Maintain and test an incident response plan.
Ensure your organization has a vulnerability program in place and that it prioritizes patch
management and vulnerability scanning. Note: CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Services (CyHy) are
free to all SLTT organizations and public and private sector critical infrastructure
organizations: https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services.

•

Properly configure and secure internet-facing network devices.
o Do not expose management interfaces to the internet.
o Disable unused or unnecessary network ports and protocols.
o Disable/remove unused network services and devices.

•

Adopt zero-trust principles and architecture, including:
o Micro-segmenting networks and functions to limit or block lateral movements.
o Enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users and VPN connections.
o Restricting access to trusted devices and users on the networks.
