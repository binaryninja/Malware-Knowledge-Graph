A watering hole was discovered on January 10, 2020 utilizing a full remote iOS exploit chain
to deploy a feature-rich implant named LightSpy. The site appears to have been designed to
target users in Hong Kong based on the content of the landing page. Since the initial activity,
we released two private reports exhaustively detailing spread, exploits, infrastructure and
LightSpy implants.

Landing page of watering hole site

We are temporarily calling this APT group “TwoSail Junk”. Currently, we have hints from
known backdoor callbacks to infrastructure about clustering this campaign with previous
activity. And we are working with colleagues to tie LightSpy with prior activity from a long
running Chinese-speaking APT group, previously reported on as Spring Dragon/Lotus
Blossom/Billbug(Thrip), known for their Lotus Elise and Evora backdoor malware.
Considering that this LightSpy activity has been disclosed publicly by our colleagues from
TrendMicro, we would like to further contribute missing information to the story without
duplicating content. And, in our quest to secure technologies for a better future, we reported
the malware and activity to Apple and other relevant companies.

This supplemental information can be difficult to organize to make for easy reading. In light of
this, this document is broken down into several sections.
1. Deployment timeline – additional information clarifying LightSpy deployment milestone
events, including both exploit releases and individual LightSpy iOS implant component
updates.
2. Spreading – supplemental technical details on various techniques used to deliver
malicious links to targets
3. Infrastructure – supplemental description of a TwoSail Junk RDP server, the LightSpy
admin panel, and some related server-side javascript
4. Android implant and a pivot into evora – additional information on an Android implant
and related infrastructure. After pivoting from the infrastructure in the previous section,
we find related implants and backdoor malware, helping to connect this activity to
previously known SpringDragon APT with low confidence.
More information about LightSpy is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence
Reporting. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com

Deployment timeline
During our investigation, we observed the actor modifying some components involved in the
exploit chain on February 7, 2020 with major changes, and on March 5, 2020 with minor
ones.

The first observed version of the WebKit exploit dated January 10, 2020 closely resembled a
proof of concept (PoC), containing elements such as buttons, alert messages, and many log
statements throughout. The second version commented out or removed many of the log
statements, changed alert() to print() statements, and also introduced some language errors
such as “your device is not support…” and “stab not find…”.
By analyzing the changes in the first stage WebKit exploit, we discovered the list of
supported devices was also significantly extended:

As seen above, the actor was actively changing implant components, which is why we are
providing a full list of historical hashes in the IoC section at the end of this report. There were
many minor changes that did not directly affect the functionality of each component, but
there were also some exceptions to this that will be expanded on below. Based on our
observations of these changes over a relatively short time frame, we can assess that the
actor implemented a fairly agile development process, with time seemingly more important
than stealthiness or quality.
One interesting observation involved the “EnvironmentalRecording” plugin (MD5:
ae439a31b8c5487840f9ad530c5db391), which was a dynamically linked shared library
responsible for recording surrounding audio and phone calls. On February 7, 2020, we
noticed a new binary (MD5: f70d6b3b44d855c2fb7c662c5334d1d5) with the same name with
4/18

no similarities to the earlier one. This new file did not contain any environment paths, version
stamps, or any other traces from the parent plugin pattern. Its sole purpose was to clean up
the implant components by erasing all files located in “/var/iolight/”, “/bin/light/”, and
“/bin/irc_loader/”. We are currently unsure whether the actor intended to replace the original
plugin with an uninstall package or if this was a result of carelessness or confusion from the
rapid development process.
Another example of a possible mistake involved the “Screenaaa” plugin. The first version
(MD5: 35fd8a6eac382bfc95071d56d4086945) that was deployed on January 10, 2020 did
what we expected: it was a small plugin designed to capture a screenshot, create a directory,
and save the captured file in JPEG format. However, the plugin (MD5:
7b69a20920d3b0e6f0bffeefdce7aa6c) with the same name that was packaged on February
7 had a completely different functionality. This binary was actually a LAN scanner based on
MMLanScan, an open source project for iOS that helps scan a network to show available
devices along with their MAC addresses, hostname, and manufacturer. Most likely, this
plugin was mistakenly bundled up in the February 7 payload with the same name as the
screenshot plugin.

Spreading

5/18

We cannot say definitively that we have visibility into all of their spreading mechanisms. We
do know that in past campaigns, precise targeting of individuals was performed over various
social network platforms with direct messaging. And, both ours and previous reporting from
others have documented TwoSail Junk’s less precise and broad use of forum posts and
replies. These forum posts direct individuals frequenting these sites to pages hosting iframes
served from their exploit servers. We add Telegram channels and Instagram posts to the list
of communication channels abused by these attackers.
These sites and communication media are known to be frequented by some activist groups.

The initial watering hole site (hxxps://appledaily.googlephoto[.]vip/news[.]html) on January
10, 2020 was designed to mimic a well-known Hong Kong based newspaper “Apple Daily” by
copy-pasting HTML content from the original:

However, at that time, we had not observed any indications of the site being purposely
distributed in the wild. Based on our KSN detection statistics, we began seeing a massive
distribution campaign beginning on February 18, 2020.

Table 2. LightSpy related iframe domains, urls, and first seen timestamps

Starting on February 18, the actors began utilizing a series of invisible iframes to redirect
potential victims to the exploit site as well as the intended legitimate news site from the lure.

Infrastructure
RDP Clues
The domain used for the initial watering hole page (googlephoto[.]vip) was registered through
GoDaddy on September 24, 2019. No unmasked registration information was able to be
obtained for this domain. The subdomain (appledaily.googlephoto[.]vip) began resolving to a
non-parked IP address (103.19.9[.]185) on January 10, 2020 and has not moved since. The
server is located in Singapore and is hosted by Beyotta Network, LLP.
At the time of our initial investigation, the server was listening on ports 80 (HTTP) and 3389
(RDP with SSL/TLS enabled). The certificate for the server was self-signed and created on
December 16, 2019. Based on Shodan data as early as December 21, 2019, there was a
currently logged in user detected whose name was “SeinandColt”.

Admin Panel
The C2 server for the iOS payload (45.134.1[.]180) also appeared to have an admin panel
on TCP port 50001.

9/18

The admin panel seems to be a Vue.js application bundled with Webpack. It contains two
language packs: English and Chinese. A cursory analysis provides us the impression of
actual scale of the framework:

If we take a closer look at the index.js file for the panel, some interesting configurations are
visible, to include a user config, an application list, log list, and other interesting settings.
The “userConfig” variable indicates other possible platforms that may have been targeted by
the same actors, such as linux, windows, and routers.

10/18

Another interesting setting includes the “app_list” variable which is commented out. This lists
two common applications used for streaming and chat mostly in China (QQ and Miapoi).
Looking further, we can also see that the default map coordinates in the config point directly
to the Tian’anmen Gate in Beijing, however, most likely this is just a common and symbolic
mapping application default for the center of Beijing.

Android implants and a pivot into “evora”
During analysis of the infrastructure related to iOS implant distribution we also found a link
directing to Android malware – hxxp://app.hkrevolution[.]club/HKcalander[.]apk (MD5:
77ebb4207835c4f5c4d5dfe8ac4c764d).
According to artefacts found in google cache, this link was distributed through Telegram
channels “winuxhk” and “brothersisterfacebookclub”, and Instagram posts in late November
2019 with a message lure in Chinese translated as “The Hong Kong People Calendar APP is
online ~~~ Follow the latest Hong Kong Democracy and Freedom Movement. Click to
download and support the frontline. Currently only Android version is available.”
Further technical analysis of the packed APK reveals the timestamp of its actual build –
2019-11-04 18:12:33. Also it uses the subdomain, sharing an iOS implant distribution
domain, as its c2 server – hxxp://svr.hkrevolution[.]club:8002.
Its code contains a link to another related domain:

Checking this server, we found it hosted another related APK:
MD5

fadff5b601f6fca588007660934129eb

URL

hxxp://movie.poorgoddaay[.]com/MovieCal[.]apk

C2

hxxp://app.poorgoddaay[.]com:8002

Build timestamp

2019-07-25 21:57:47

The distribution vector remains the same – Telegram channels:

12/18

The latest observed APK sample is hosted on a server that is unusual for the campaign
context – xxinc-media[.]oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs[.]com. We assume that the actors are
taking steps to split the iOS and Android activities between different infrastructure pieces.
MD5

5d2b65790b305c186ef7590e5a1f2d6b

2020-01-14 18:30:30

We had not observed any indications of this URL being distributed in the wild yet.
If we take a look closer at the domain poorgoddaay[.]com that not only hosted the malicious
APK but also was a C2 for them, we can note that there are two subzones of particular
interest to us:
zg.poorgoddaay[.]com
ns1.poorgoddaay[.]com
We were able to work with partners to pivot into a handful of “evora” samples that use the
above two subzones as their C2. Taking that a step further, using our Kaspersky Threat
Attribution Engine (KTAE), we can see that the partner samples using those subzones are
99% similar to previous backdoors deployed by SpringDragon.

13/18

We are aware of other related and recent “evora” malware samples calling back to these
same subnets while targeting organizations in Hong Kong as well. These additional factors
help lend at least low confidence to clustering this activity with
SpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug.

Conclusion
This particular framework and infrastructure is an interesting example of an agile approach to
developing and deploying surveillance framework in Southeast Asia. This innovative
approach is something we have seen before from SpringDragon, and LightSpy targeting
geolocation at least falls within previous regional targeting of
SpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug APT, as does infrastructure and “evora” backdoor use.
