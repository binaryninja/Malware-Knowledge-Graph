Energy at risk
A study of IT security in the Energy
and Natural Resources industry
kpmg.com/energyaspac

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Companies now not only face cyber attacks from hacking groups, script
kiddies and hactivists, they are also threatened by state-sponsored agencies
with limitless resources. These agencies usually carry out cyber attacks to
seek a competitive edge, gain access to intellectual property, or for sheer
sabotage. In other words, cyber threats have never been more pervasive and
attack damages never more real.
The situation is especially grim for the Energy and Natural Resources
(ENR) industry. The sector is plagued by two key problems. For one, top
management has traditionally not placed sufficient emphasis on information
security. Also, much more focus is placed on connectivity compared to
security. As a result, the ENR sector has become an enticing and relatively
easy target for cyber attacks.
As evidenced in recent cyber incidents “Shamoon1” and “Night Dragon2”,
the resultant loss and combined damage, be it substantial or intellectual,
would be far greater than the cost of preventive security measures.
In this increasingly insecure environment, senior management should
refresh their perspective to safeguard their key corporate assets.
For many organisations in the Asia Pacific, a cyber security-oriented
structural transformation might be necessary.

“I am convinced that there are only two types of companies:
those that have been hacked and those that will be. And even
they are converging into one category: companies that have
been hacked and will be hacked again.”
Robert S. Mueller, FBI Director
RSA Cyber Security Conference
March 2012

Shamoon, also known as Disttrack, is a modular computer virus discovered in 2012 that attacks computers running the
Microsoft Windows "NT" line of operating systems. The virus is being used for cyber espionage in the energy sector. Its
discovery was announced on 16 August 2012 by Symantec, Kaspersky Lab, and Seculert.

Operation Night Dragon was a Cyber Attack against energy companies which was exposed by the security company
McAfee. Night Dragon attacks are designed to steal sensitive data from targeted organisations. Unlike opportunistic
attacks, the perpetrators appear to be sophisticated, highly organised, and motivated in their pursuits.

What is going on
The Current Global Situation
Cyber threats and IT risks are omnipresent.
Compared to the past when criminals
used a scattergun approach, cyber
attacks now are much more focused and
intelligent. Let us first take a peek into an
attacker’s world.

An attacker’s perspective
Understanding the perspective
of an attacker is essential for
everyone involved in fighting
cybercrime. For that reason,
staff in KPMG Netherlands
interviewed one of their
professionals – an ‘ethical hacker’.
He relayed us an intriguing
fictitious story. It is up to you to
judge how realistic this threat
would be to your organisation.
“My employer insists on remaining
anonymous, but rest assured, he is
quite resourceful. He approached me
a few weeks ago with a job offer. The
goal he set was quite ambitious: steal
as many secrets from the government
as you can. Let me tell you about the
steps I took.
First, I sat down to think about what
I knew about the government’s IT
infrastructure. At a conference last fall,
I had met an IT director of a ministry
who had told me that all firewalls for
the government were supplied by the
same vendor, company Y. Hacking such
a firewall was a formidable task - not
something I was ready to take on directly.
Instead, I took a more indirect approach.
I logged in to LinkedIn and
searched for employees of software
development companies who
mentioned company Y as one of their
clients on their LinkedIn profile. Many
professionals mention prestigious
client names in their profile, even
when company policy prohibits name
dropping. Shortly after, I found multiple
software vendors which make niche
software and listed company Y as a
client. I visited the vendors’ websites

and scanned their externally reachable
IP addresses until I found one which had
an unpatched vulnerability in their web
server: company X. After a day’s work,
I was inside their network.
Company X is a small organisation and
they do not feel they need network
segmentation, so I was able to reach
all machines on their internal network
through that web server. After some
more work, I was able to elevate my
privileges to domain administrator, which
meant I had full access to all of their
systems.
This was where I hit a bump. I intended
to change the source code of their
product in such a way that it would allow
me to connect remotely to the system of
anyone who installed it, but I had never
done that before. I then decided to log on
to a hacker forum and posted a request
for help. I offered 10,000 euros reward
for a job well done. After a while, I was
approached by someone who was willing
to help me. I asked around to confirm his
reputation in this field. I enlisted his help
in modifying the source code of the main
product of company X.
The security policies of company Y were
very strict: only the system administrators
can install software on the workstations,
and both incoming and outgoing traffic
goes through a proxy server. Luckily, the
virus which my associate hacker had
written communicates through DNS,
which was not actively monitored or
filtered. The software from company
X was updated on a regular basis, and
after three weeks I received a message
which indicated that I had access to their
workstations.

I called on my associate hacker
once more, but this time for a more
advanced task: reprogramming the
firmware of the firewalls which
company Y produces. He indicated
that he needed the help of a contact
who installed a backdoor in all firewalls
for another 20,000 euros. Now, all I
needed to do was wait for the next
update of the firmware. I posted
some fake security vulnerabilities for
the current version of this firmware,
to ensure that the firmware would
be upgraded timely. And slowly but
surely, I gained access to all internal
networks of the government.
I could then route any traffic which
flows through any government
network through my own computer.
I can also read all emails which are
sent between government employees
internally. I can find vulnerable servers
by scanning the networks. In almost
all the internal networks, I have found
at least one server which I can exploit.
I installed backdoors on hundreds of
workstations which allows me the
ability to monitor email servers, so
emails with interesting attachments
can be forwarded to me. Additionally,
I have obtained login credentials
for almost all major government
databases.
Every day, almost two hundred
gigabytes of government secrets
are sent to me automatically. This
amount is only limited by the amount
of bandwidth I can get, and the
number of hard disk drives I install.
I’m being paid 100 euros per gigabyte
of information. I will leave it to you to
calculate my hourly wage.”

The sad truth is that cybercrime is here
to stay. A report by the Government
Accountability Office indicated that 24
key government agencies in the United
States have logged a 650 percent
increase in cyber security incidents in
2011 compared to five years ago.
According to a survey by KPMG
Netherlands, 49 percent of organisations
have experienced some form of
cybercrime activity during the past 12
months while the remaining may not even
have proper detection measures in place.
Among the 49 percent, 10 percent
indicated that they have been attacked
more than 100 times within the past
year. The remaining respondents said
they were attacked successfully up to
five times last year. Most of the incidents
were not covered by the media and are
therefore not publicly known.

Information leakage most common
Globally, information leakage is one of
the most common challenges faced by
organisations.
Opening an email containing a virus from
a hacker can allow perpetrators to seize
control of your computer, read your emails
and record your passwords. Information
leakage is in fact one of the most common
types of incidents across the world and
can easily take place in your daily life.

Take for example that you have made a
donation to a local charity. In recognition
of your contribution, the organisation
lists your name on their website as a
sponsor. Two days later, you receive
an email from the Fundraising Chair
asking you to confirm your donation.
You open the email, fill out the form
(you are also careful not to include any
banking or sensitive information) and
return it to the sender. But in reality, the
email didn’t come from the charity at
all; the attachment was, in fact, a high
quality fake containing a virus, allowing
perpetrators to seize control of your
computer, read your emails and record
your passwords. Everything you know or
see is now visible to the perpetuators.
Clearly, information leakage is rapidly
becoming a board-level risk.
A 2012 survey by KPMG suggest
that more than three-quarters of the
Forbes 2000 companies leak potentially
dangerous data (See Figure 1 below).
Personal information and financial
data are often lost due to hacking,
system failure, human negligence and
disgruntled employees. Some countries
have already enacted legislation to
curb such problems. The European
Commission’s General Data Protection
Regulation released in 2012 states that
companies have the obligation to protect
their network and personal information.

Companies must also notify relevant
authorities within 24 hours after a serious
breach, or face a penalty of up to one
million Euros or two percent of turnover.
It is worth noting that hacktivist groups
are often the agents responsible for
information leakage. For instance,
members of “Anonymous”, a famous
hacktivist group, are not only known for
bringing down commercial systems and
websites, they have also infiltrated into
commercial organisations’ computer
systems, exposing correspondence and
personal data to the public in the process.
In 2010, Anonymous penetrated Sony’s
network and cost the latter US$170
million dollars in reparation for the
unauthorised disclosure of customers’
names and credit card numbers. Another
Anonymous’ affiliate group AntiSec
dumped over 860,000 user credentials
including 75,000 sets of personal and
financial information into the open
Internet after breaking into the firm
Stratfor’s systems.
During the past few years, industries
all around the globe have witnessed
for the first time carefully engineered
and profoundly complex attacks such
as Stuxnet, Night Dragon and Shamoon
(these will be described later in the
document). Cyber security has become a
grim issue that no one can avoid.

ENR Related Security Incidents
		

General
Of all the potential marks at crosshair, the
ENR industry is one of the most attractive
targets for cyber criminals.
		
According to the United States (US)
Department of Homeland Security News
Wire published in April 2012, American
water and energy companies deal with
a constant barrage of cyber attacks on a
daily basis. These incidents usually take
the form of cyber espionage or denial-ofservice (DoS)3 attacks against the utilities’
industrial-control systems.
		
According to a survey report released by
The Centre for Strategic and International
Studies in 2010, “critical infrastructure
firms such as power grids, industrial
control networks and oil refineries are
facing staggering level of cyber attacks,
and are not adequately prepared to
defend themselves”.
		
In April 2012, the US Cyber Security
response team warned of attacks upon
the gas industry. The Industrial Control
Systems Cyber Emergency Response
Team (ICS-CERT) reported a number of
cyber intrusions targeting gas pipeline
companies. Analysis of the attacks
confirmed they are part of an ongoing
campaign dating back to December 2011
and indicated Spear Phishing was used
to target a number of specific individuals
across the gas pipeline industry.

Spear phishing is an e-mail
spoofing fraud attempt that
targets a specific organisation,
seeking unauthorised access to
confidential data.
Shamoon
On 15 August 2012, Saudi Aramco, a
large national oil and gas company with
global operations, announced that they
had to disconnect their IT systems
from the Internet while dealing with a
serious disruption of their network. The
disruption, which continued for two
weeks, was the result of a cyber attack
that used a computer virus to disable over
30,000 of the company's workstations.
		
The virus, later named as “Shamoon”,
was the first significant cyber attack on a
commercial target to cause real damage.
It is also the most destructive attack the
private sector has experienced to date.

Page 3

Later in the same month Rasgas, a main
player in the Qatari Liquid and Natural
Gas scene, was also hit by the Shamoon
(as per security experts) virus and
consequently forced to bring their entire
network offline.

Night Dragon
Another series of cyber incidents in the
ENR sector were dubbed collectively
by security company McAfee as
“Night Dragon”. McAfee believes that
these attacks on global oil, energy and
petrochemical companies may have
started as early as in 2007.
Evidence from McAfee has shown
that this series of well-coordinated and
specifically focused attacks involve
a myriad of different techniques and
methods. The primary target seems to be
any financial information related to bids
and oil-and-gas operations.
McAfee also pointed out that all the
attacks took place regularly during
weekdays from 9am to 5pm in GMT
+8 time zone, which matched with the
source location as determined by the
IP address, thus pointing at the high
possibility of “company men” being hired
to perform the job systematically.

Others
There are many more cyber security
incidents which have taken place in the
ENR industry.

In another case, unidentified hackers
helped a manufacturer in China obtain the
breakthrough design of a wind turbine
by an energy company in the United
Kingdom. The Chinese manufacturer
subsequently made and sold the product
at a much lower price, driving the original
company in the UK into closure.
DoS attacks represent yet another form of
cyber security attacks which cause huge
financial losses and massive damage to
companies in the ENR sector. A report
published by McAfee in 2011 stated that
four out of every five oil, gas and power
companies have suffered at least one
DoS attack in 2011.
Cyber attacks are also increasingly
escalating into cyber warfare. In an
October 2012 Wall Street Journal article,
U.S. officials noted that “Iranian hackers
with government ties have mounted
cyber attacks in 2012 against American
targets, escalating a low-grade cyber war
... The Iranian effort culminated in a series
of attacks against U.S. banks as well as
electronic assaults on energy companies
in the Persian Gulf.”
These incidents clearly show the
increasing severity of cyber attacks and
give an idea on how important cyber
security will be in the future.
A denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or
network resource unavailable to its intended users.
3

In 2011, a Canadian-based company
which supplies remote administration and
monitoring tools to Fortune 100 energy
companies reported that it had suffered
a security breach. Upon breaching the
corporate network, the attackers installed
malicious software on computers and
stole information related to a remote
administration tool which the company
supplies.
Another incident of more recent times
occurred in early 2013. In February
2013, the US Department of Energy
confirmed that computers and servers
at its Washington headquarters were
compromised in the previous month.
In this attack, personally identifiable
information of several hundred employees
and contractors may have been
compromised. Seemingly non-critical at
first glance, this information may however
be used to further future attacks into
having serious consequences.

Overview of Major Problems
The obvious question to ask is why these
various organisations are so vulnerable in
the face of cyber attackers.

appropriate key performance indicators to
assess improvement.

In 2012, Carnegie Mellon University
conducted their yearly survey for largest
American companies. The results
indicated that more than 70 percent of
C-Suite executives and members of the
board are not actively involved in the
protection of their company data. They
are also rarely involved in the inspection
of key employees working on information
security or the revision of corporate-wide
policies in this aspect.

The ENR sector is critical as it powers
the growth of almost every economy
in the world. The sector can be broadly
divided into three categories: electricity,
petroleum and natural gas. In the
electricity category, both automation
systems and utilities controls of electricity
infrastructure are built on a complicated
system known as the Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).
Similarly, the production and distribution
of petroleum and natural gas are heavily
dependent on systems similar to SCADA.

A similar trend has been observed by
the Government Accountability Office
in American government agencies.
Despite receiving numerous security
recommendations each year, companies
were not implementing these properly.
Key personnel were also not being trained
adequately. In addition, there is a lack of
proper monitoring on security controls or

Unfortunately, such industrial
infrastructure control systems have been
facing a severe legacy problem in recent
years. They have been rashly connected
to the Internet for remote accessibility
without implementing adequate security
measures. This has in turn led to higher
chances of such systems falling prey to
cyber attacks.

The who & why of cyber attacks
In this era of information and
connectivity, malicious hackers are able
to easily find information assets as
targets in a corporate network.
What is at stake is financially valuable
data such as mergers-and-acquisitions
plans, transaction records, quarterly/
annual reports and internet banking
details. Strategic information including
intellectual property, contact details
of senior executives, records of legal
disputes and various trade secrets are
also at risk.
In addition, personal data like employees’
addresses and date of birth, once
compromised might very well be used in
facilitating identity theft.
Last but not least, process control
networks are being increasingly favoured
by attackers given their vast potential
in bringing about significant impact, as
proven in the famous Stuxnet case4
and other incidents described earlier.
Given how the numerous production
and exploration activities carried out by
energy companies are dependent on
these networks, this trend is of particular
relevance and importance to the ENR
sector.

Document meta-data is information
‘about’ a document, or information
on its properties. It often informs
who created a document, when
and where on a device or network.
According to version information
retrieved from document meta-data,
71 percent of the 2000 companies may
be using potentially vulnerable and outdated versions of Microsoft and Adobe
software.
Furthermore, 16 percent of corporate
web servers may be vulnerable to
attack due to missing security patches
or out-dated server software. Many
instances of un-patched and unsupported
web server software were found to be
serving Forbes 2000 corporate websites.

Figure 2: Number of potentially sensitive

A 2011 report by KPMG has shown that
oil and gas operations are amongst the
top 10 sectors which suffer from the
most information leakages worldwide.
Information leakages involving oil and gas
operations account for six percent of all
security incidents.
Some of the sources of leakage
are within the direct control of the
corporation and can be prevented if
companies put in the effort. These
sources include websites, documents
and web servers. However, there are also
other channels such as popular search
engines and forums which are outside of
the usual enterprise security curtain and
pose a much more complex challenge.
Stuxnet is a computer worm discovered in June 2010
that is believed to have been created to attack Iran's
nuclear facilities. Stuxnet initially spreads via Microsoft
Windows, and targets Siemens industrial software and
equipment. Kaspersky Lab concluded that the sophisticated
attack could only have been conducted "with nation-state
support". Different variants of Stuxnet targeted five Iranian
organizations, with the probable target widely suspected to be
uranium enrichment infrastructure in Iran

The KPMG report also revealed that
78 percent of Forbes 2000 corporate
websites leak some form of potentially
useful information through their
document meta-data.

Part of KPMG’s research focused on
the structure of the Forbes 2000
corporate websites to identify any
potentially sensitive file locations or
hidden functionality that may be useful
to cyber attackers. A number of file
locations marked ‘private’ were also
identified, hosting documents that were
not intended for public consumption
(See Figure 2 below).
The direct result is that out of all the
servers used for corporate websites,
15 percent offer hacker access to test
functionality and private login portals that
potentially allow file upload capabilities
that could likely lead to full take-over of
servers by cyber attackers.
Oil & Gas operations have also emerged
in the list of top 10 sectors that post

most information to public forums
and newsgroups. There are as
many as 88,681 of such postings in
newsgroup alone, according to the
report.
If past experience has taught us
anything, it is that cyber attackers and
organised crime do not target one
avenue of attack. Instead, they use a
combination of available information
leaks to profile a target, and map out
the target’s internal systems and their
components.
It is important to emphasise that
the processes used to gather the
information leaks mentioned above are
not sophisticated and available to anyone
with access to the Internet and little
more than a web browser.

Industrial Control System
The problem is even worse when it
comes to control systems which are
widely adopted by ENR industries,
as explained by chief cyber security
strategist from Computer Sciences
Corporation (CSC ), Donald Purdy.
Purdy, formerly a cyber official at the
Department of Homeland Security,
mentioned during a major security
conference in San Francisco in 2012:
“These are older systems so they are
harder to control. And for convenience
and cost savings, people have connected
them to the internet in order to control
them from remote locations. So this
is almost a perfect storm in terms of
vulnerability because the nation is so
dependent on these systems… This is a
significant security issue for the United
States and frankly for the world.”
In the monthly monitor report released
last September by the US Industrial
Control Systems Cyber Emergency
Response Team (ICS-CERT), it was also
mentioned that “the positive aspects of
better connectivity were overshadowed
by the introduction of significant
vulnerabilities”.
For instance, Justin W. Clarke, a
30-year-old cyber security researcher
and electric utility expert discovered
two major vulnerabilities in 2012 on
Siemens’ RuggedCom equipment which
is extensively used by companies in
communicating with power stations
situated in different locations.

of Stuxnet, which can cause immense
damage to critical infrastructures.
In contrast to the published vulnerabilities,
certain manufacturers of critical system
controllers are reacting way too slowly
which have resulted in research groups like
Digital Bond, releasing exploits for these
vulnerabilities in order to “stimulate” the
patching and upgrading efficiency.
When it comes to electrical power,
technology is also a double-edged sword.
While advances in smart grid technologies
have helped better detect power theft
and reduce power loss with smart meters
been recently deployed in countries such
as in Serbia and Brazil, these technologies
also give rise to possibilities of their
advanced functionalities being used for
shady purposes.
For instance, two demonstrations
at Security B-Sides and Black Hat
conferences illustrated that hackers
could basically tweak the smart metres
currently in use to perform functionalities
as they wish, which include changing of
temperature, controlling of lighting and
even cutting of power during emergencies.
As a side note on corporate security
policies and procedures, the Saudi Aramco
incident where large number of business
computers were disabled, also highlighted
importance of monitoring network attacks
initiated by inside personnel and the
potential danger of using portable storage
media like thumb drives.

Categorised Active Players
Over the years, two major shifts in trends
have been observed in terms of cyber
attacks.
Firstly, the targets are shifting from
individual organisations to chains of
related companies. Secondly, the main
components of attackers have shifted
from script kiddies to criminal groups,
with the latter being much more
specialised and coordinated.
Some of the major players include:
• organised cyber criminals who are
most known for mass stealing of
personal identities and financial data,
• state or corporate sponsored
espionage like the Night Dragon
operation which aims to steal critical
intellectual and business information,
• hacktivists such as Wikileaks,
Anonymous and LulzSec who have
amassed a large number of supporters
and participants,
• malicious inside personnel, as in the
case of Bradley Edward Manning,
a United States Army soldier who
was arrested in May 2010 in Iraq on
suspicion of having passed classified
material to the website WikiLeaks.
Just as attacks have evolved, companies
too must evolve by re-evaluating their
own ability to detect, defend and respond
to cyber attacks.

The first vulnerability is essentially a secret
“back door” which would easily allow
hackers remote access into the equipment.
The second vulnerability makes it possible
for hackers to intercept the network traffic
between operator and devices which may
contain authentication credentials. Potential
attackers could take advantage of such
flaws to manipulate power stations or
use these flaws to launch another set of
attacks on a much larger scale.
The situation is made even worse when
independent researchers release and
circulate system flaws and vulnerabilities
for reference and countermeasure
studies. While the intention behind such
documents might be good, the direct
consequence is that many could now
easily gain access to dangerous and
powerful “weapons” such as the code

Various Attack Vectors

into execution of malware and Spear
Phishing. (See Figure 3 below).

Cyber incidents can be loosely divided
into three categories. The first category
is accidental events due to human
error, system failure or unanticipated
accidents. The second category refers to
unauthorised access into networks and
systems by hackers or employees. The
third category does not require actual
access as it usually causes denial of
service or loss of data.

A group of attackers who are particularly
good at social engineering is Anonymous.
These hackers typically exploit easy-toguess passwords of users or use emails
to trick users into revealing confidential
information or into clicking links which
lead to the download of malicious
software.

Attack methods could involve
complicated and coordinated efforts
to beat the cyber security protection
mechanism and intelligence
reconnaissance, followed by social
engineering techniques for acquiring of
target information.

However, Anonymous is not the only
group of people who are familiar with
this technique. In fact, cyber criminals
and state-sponsored attackers have
been practising it for a far longer time.
The stakes are also bigger for them as
they stand to gain a whole lot more of
important information.

There are six most common types
of security failings. These are shared
accounts, weak passwords, lack of
effective network monitoring, lack of
effective Web monitoring, absence of
logging and absence of log analysis.
Lack of user awareness also provides
more opportunities for social engineering
attempts to succeed. Examples of such
attempts include luring Internet users

Eddie Schwartz, chief security officer
of the security firm RSA summed it up
best during a security conference in San
Francisco in 2012 when he said: “The
attacks by them (Anonymous) pale in
comparison to the nation-state stuff and
the criminal element… The more eyes,
the greater chance of success (for an
attack)”, which accurately depicts the
cyber environment nowadays.

Impact on companies who fall
prey to such attacks
The objectives of cyber attacks can be
divided into two distinct categories.
These are
• misappropriation and theft of
intellectual property, financial data
or other confidential information for
monetary gain or to gain a competitive
edge;
• corruption or disturbance of key
business assets and processes for
strategic purposes or to make an
activism statement,
However, the actual impact on victim
companies could be much broader and
more profound.
More specifically, direct consequences
of such attacks comprise disruption of
business and production processes,
unauthorised access to monetary
operation, loss of intellectual property,
disclosure of merger-and-acquisition

deals, identity theft and compromising
of customer data. Such attacks can also
adversely affect third party partners in the
industrial chain. (See Figure 4 below).
But all the above consequences are
just the tip of the iceberg. Deeper
financial and reputational impact further
includes loss of competitive advantage
in accessing new fields, failure to keep
current clients and investors, losing
deals and disputes (or winning them on
unfavourable terms), regulatory fines,
liability lawsuits, share price drops, costs
involved in fixing business relationships
and even negative international publicity.
In addition, the company would very
likely be forced to spend more than usual
to fix systems and repair damages. It
is also very likely that costly fees will
be incurred from services of third party
experts and consultants for mitigation and
recovery services. There could also be
forced expenditure on personnel change,
organisational restructuring and additional
training.

How companies can cope
The need for action
However, effective awareness requires
continuous effort to remain vigilant. In this
aspect the financial institutions seem to
be doing a better job in understanding the
potential “enemy” compared to the other
industries, including the ENR sector.

The Obama administration submitted
a cyber security proposal to Congress
last May to outline its priorities for
cyber security and to press lawmakers
to pass comprehensive legislation to
protect critical U.S. infrastructure that
powers the Internet, utilities, and other
control systems that are vulnerable to
attack.
Feds Simulate Crippling Cyber security
Attack On NYC Electricity [March 2012]

The key is to be able to understand the
motives behind a cyber attack. It must
be made clear the cyber world is no
longer playing in the “minor league”, but
rather the “major league” with players
who potentially have access to unlimited
resources and endless patience in
achieving an aforementioned objective.
On a second note it is extremely
necessary to conduct thorough analysis
of risks and have a clear understanding
of the different asset value perception.
What seems of little value to one firm
might be worth a lot more to attackers
who have a totally different perspective
or who are planning an attack on a chain
of companies.
As a result, consideration should be given
to the relationship between the costs
for implementing detective controls and
costs of incidents. The latter should
include indirect damages incurred on
consumer confidence and reputation, the
two most valuable assets of a company.
A 2012 survey titled ”A nuanced
perspective on cybercrime” which was
conducted by KPMG in Netherlands,

Advances in technology and mounting
concern about the potential for a cyber
attack to damage power stations,
water-treatment plants and other
critical systems have prompted senior
officials to seek a more robust role for
the department’s Cyber Command. For
one thing, cyber attacks can take place
in milliseconds. The assailant may be
unknown. The attack route may be hard
to trace, crossing multiple countries.

Iran is to move key ministries and
state bodies off the worldwide
internet next month in an effort
to shield them behind a secure
computer wall from disruptive cyber
attacks like the Stuxnet and Flame
viruses. “The establishment of the
national intelligence network will
create a situation where the precious
intelligence of the country won’t be
accessible to these powers.”

Pentagon proposes more robust role for its
cyber-specialists [August 2012]

Iran to unplug from Web to escape ‘Internet
monopoly’ [August 2012]

stated that out of the 170 responding
organisations under various sectors
including ENR, approximately
19 percent of them spend more than 1.5
million euros on cybercrime prevention,
detection and response per year.

Most importantly, it is vital for the
management to set the correct tone.
KPMG's experience with clients has
shown over and over again that security
is largely a management issue.

Thirdly, whether short term measures
or long term controls have been
implemented, the upper management of
companies should never be complacent
and believe that they enjoy 100 percent
security. The IT landscape in many
modern organisations is simply often too
complex for complete protection.

The survey also showed that more
than 75 percent of respondents believe
that fighting cybercrime goes beyond
installing the needed technology to curb
it. Some 90 percent of them also agree
that cybercrime should be discussed at
the board level.

The same 2012 KPMG survey also
revealed that 45 percent of companies
experienced attempts of cybercrime
attacks in 2011. In addition, 55 percent
of respondents were unsure of whether
they can effectively respond to a
cybercrime attack, and only 20 percent
said they can respond effectively to an
attack but unfortunately do not have an
attack response plan in place. Among all
the responding corporates, approximately
30 percent have forensic capabilities as a
control and only 55 percent have central
incident and event monitoring capabilities.

So are companies in the ENR
industry up to the challenge?
Most respondents from the ENR sector
of the same KPMG survey do not think
so. They believe that hackers are more
likely to win in this sector compared to
other industries.
If a company does not consider itself to be
ready, actions must be taken. Management
should endorse prevention efforts and start
seeking a structured approach.
There also has to be effective use
of security monitoring and seamless
cooperation between the different parties
involved so that knowledge and expertise
can be shared among government,
business communities, IT security groups
and even cross-border organisations.
Beyond the prevention of incidents,
timely detection and an adequate

response are also critical. If there is any
major gap or deficiency in the policies,
procedures and tools of a company, the
worst time to discover these would be
when a cyber security incident is already
set on its course.

also of paramount value in the proper
handling of a security compromise and
reducing the subsequent damage.

Yet, even the most comprehensive
security control system cannot guarantee
the complete prevention of cyber
incidents. An incident response plan and
an emergency action plan is therefore

If a thorough and detailed plan is not
available, the very least an organisation
should do is to be familiar with some
basic concepts and simple primary
actions to respond to an incident.
(See Figure 5 below). This helps the
company achieve more effective
business resilience, which is important
especially for the protection of the most
critical assets. The fundamentals of
cybersecurity are probably best summed
up by Ron Ross, National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Senior
Fellow, who said during a launch of NIST’s
latest guidance on security controls: “The
fundamentals of cyber security … I call it
the physics of security … don't change
over time … how we apply those controls
... is a little bit different, but the same
fundamentals.”

Prevent

Short term action prevention
Perform risk analysis from
perspective of attacker

In terms of short-term actions, the
company could perform risk analysis from
the perspective of an attacker, identify
and monitor critical assets as well as
begin implementing a standby incident
response team.
In the long run, companies should strive
for cost-effective control of the cyber
environment by addressing the domains
of people, processes and technology.

Suggested frameworks
Given the shifting perspective of the
defence against cybercrime, a more modern
approach to cyber security therefore also
focuses on the perspective of the criminals.
In terms of risk assessment, the
organisation must not only consider itself as
an attractive end target, but also consider
its part in the supply chain. It should
also not view itself as one entity that
should be protected, but as a collection of
processes, users and IT infrastructure.
Companies should focus on being well
informed of (the character) of possible
threats and invest in a proper defence.
They should not do this in an isolated
way, but rather use the knowledge
and experience of colleagues in both
the public and private sector. A joint
response is essential for protection

against cyber espionage, terrorism,
crime and disruption of information and
communication systems.

ICS-CERT Recommendation
With respect to the industrial control system,
ICS-CERT5 suggests a proactive security
model as depicted in the Figure 6 below.
This model can be further complemented
with a more detailed five-step approach in
protecting information and records:
• Obtain executive sponsorship, establish
a team, and determine the team's goal,
objectives, and milestones - ensuring
that these efforts are aligned with the
goals of the business.
• Develop a training and awareness
campaign. Policy content should
be comprehensive, consistent and
implemented with process changes

and the introduction of appropriate
controls and metrics to measure
effectiveness and compliance.
• Assess the current state of the
organisation's information protection
efforts. Classifying the sensitivity of
information should be a key goal.
• Design the desired state of information
integrity protection, with the goal of
establishing improved handling and
protection practices that achieve policy
requirements, lower business risk, and
increase productivity.
• Implement the desired state.
Enhanced process and data
workflows, controls, and processes
are a key outcome. The result is
a programme that helps leaders
ensure the risk-based protection of
information assets.

Real life case studies
There have been quite a few cases
worldwide where KPMG applied the
use of frameworks and helped different
clients with their needs in achieving the
goal of cyber security.

In the Dutch market, joint efforts
of the financial sector are pretty
successful in boosting awareness.
Aside from cooperation between
financial institutions and the
Government, KPMG also actively
shares experiences as part of the
focused joint efforts.
Generally, there are three types
of security controls: prevention,
detection and response.

KPMG in the Netherlands provides the banks with an
update on the trends in cybercrime threats and potential
solutions twice a year.
KPMG employs a global network of hundreds of information
security specialists, which reaches virtually all major
financial institutions worldwide.
Attack patterns observed at other banks and solutions
applied by these institutions help to shape an image of
upcoming attacks and solutions relevant for Company B.
Knowledge of the latest cybercrime attack trends and defence
measures helps Company B to update the bank’s defences
on time in order to adequately respond to attacks.

In general, preventive controls are
more popular than detective controls
whereas detective controls are used
more often than responsive controls,
as in this case of how KPMG helped
a company in the ENR industry.
However, as discussed earlier,
incidents cannot be avoided 100
percent of the time. This implies that
detection and response are equally
important and are thus the areas with
the biggest room for improvement.

Company Z is a well-known company in the oil, gas and
natural resources industry.
KPMG firms’ teamed with a technology partner provider
to supervise one of the largest global implementations of
a security monitoring platform. The platform correlates
information about thousands of security events from
numerous systems spanning across the globe.
A list of the most relevant cybercrime risks for Company Z
was drafted in close cooperation with the organisation.
For each risk, a set of detection rules was defined.
The ability to adequately respond is mainly achieved by
properly established processes and governance. KPMG
advised on governance structure, engineered new incident
response processes and established training programmes
for security personnel.

Below is another example illustrating
KPMG’s experience in adequate and
systematic response after a security
incident has taken place:

Company A was informed by a whistleblower that an
attacker gained access to the company’s website and/or
closed environment. In response to this news the website
was taken offline and KPMG was asked to assist.
• A collaboration of Forensic technology and IT security
experts captured forensically sound images of the most
critical servers to make sure no traces or evidence were
lost.
• The images were analysed for traces in system files
and properties, logs from firewalls were secured and
analysed, KPMG also analysed all traffic to and from the
compromised servers.
• The analysis showed that the perpetrator succeeded in
creating and uploading several files to the web server that
contained malicious code, allowing the perpetrator to send
commands to the server from a remote location.
• KPMG helped the client by implementing remedial
procedures and additional security measures, thus
mitigating the risk of further damage and bad publicity.
Even if it is within an organisation itself,
one way of improving the handling
of specific cyber incidents related to
industrial control systems would be
to gather a group of staff to conduct
brainstorming and collaboration exercises
During such sessions, staff from various
departments will get to receive more

Page 15

adequate cyber security training, initiate
effective inter-departmental interactions,
and update antiquated policies and
procedures. They can also get to identify
and fix any security flaws found in the
system, so as to create a corporate and
organisational environment that is more
resistant to cyber attacks.

Conclusion
The battle against cyber crime is one which is difficult to win.
From the perspective of the Asia Pacific region, we understand that data security
is not an easy concept for most business leaders to fully grasp. In part, this is
because many organisations do not have a clear view on the actual value of their
data and as a result, tend to follow a one-size-fits-all approach to data security.
At the same time, organisations in this region have also seen a gradual migration
of their corporate value away from physical assets (such as facilities, products
and people) towards digital assets (such as bid information, technology designs
or customer data). Therefore, most businesses have robust crisis plans for events
like floods, fires or sudden executive departures, but have very few for digital
security issues.
An organisation in the ENR industry must stay as up-to-date as possible with
security issues and set in place effective security measures. Beyond doing so, an
ENR organisation must evaluate itself through the eyes of potential attackers so
as to identify and protect parts which represent the highest substantial value.
The importance of executive leadership and support in developing a data security
strategy cannot be overstated. The risk of data loss should be a board-level issue
and not a challenge isolated to the IT department and risk managers. This means
that executives must not only ‘walk the walk’ when it comes to complying with
protocols, but also actively participate in the development of security to ensure
that the rules reflect the priorities of the business. Most importantly, executives
must strive to institutionalise continuous improvement mechanisms to ensure
that they learn from hard-earned lessons of the past.
Should a cyber security transformation be undertaken, the five recommended
objectives would be to Prevent, to Prepare, to Protect, to Remediate and to
Integrate and Transform.
However, given the scope and complexity of the challenge, it is not surprising
that most executives are left wondering how best to approach the issue without
dampening productivity or expending scarce resources.
It is important that executives in the Asia Pacific region balance a cautious
approach to IT security with the downside and damage that can be caused
by the lack of being able to carry on business as normal and the loss of
confidential and sensitive information.
