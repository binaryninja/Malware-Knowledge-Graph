APT Cobalt Strike Campaign targeting Slovakia (DEF
CON talk)

Ladislav Baco Monday, Aug 9, 2021

In March 2021 our researchers discovered APT campaign targeting Slovakia. We found that
this campaign has been active at least since February 2021 and some C&C servers were
still active in June 2021. Threat actor used mostly Cobalt Strike and phishing emails and
documents on behalf of Slovak National Security Authority. Our threat intelligence and
malware research revealed several command and controls servers around the globe. Some
of them had direct relations to targets in Slovak republic.

Cobalt Strike

1/11

As described on the Cobalt Strike’s website, Cobalt Strike is “software for Adversary
Simulations and Red Team Operations”. It is a commercial tool with price $3,500 per user
for one year and it is used by many pentesters and red teamers as well as by some of the
advanced threat actors such as APT19, APT29, APT32, Leviathan, Cobalt Group and FIN6.
Again, official website says:
“Cobalt Strike gives you a post-exploitation agent and covert channels to emulate a
quiet long-term embedded actor in your customer’s network”.
Therefore it is kind of more interesting malware than relatively common backdoors, rats and
Metasploit and other publicly accessible free samples.

“NSA” ISO Sample
Somebody submitted the sample called AktualizC!ciu.img to the sandbox Any.Run on 23rd
March 2021. This sample was been submitted for analysis from Slovakia. And then, it has
been submitted again on 9th April. Probabably someone was already/again investigating
the attack. The original ISO filesystem contains timestamps with information about the
timezone: UTC-07:00 (Pacific Daylight Time). Also, this sample has been submitted to
VirusTotal shortly after the reported timestamps of creation the ISO filesystems. This
indicates that no tampering of creation timestamps of ISO filesystem has been applied.
The Volume name of the ISO filesystem is interesting - it contains “NBU”, which is
abbreviation of the National Security Authority in Slovakia.

Fig. 2: Content of NSA ISO Sample
The “NSA” ISO Sample contains two files: one LNK file and one DLL file. The LNK file
actually executes the following command: C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe
diassvcs.dll InitializeComponent

Refering the access time of LNK file, this file has been accessed 13 minutes before the ISO
filesystem has been created. Thus there is probably no automation in the packaging
process of the malware sample and the payload for delivery (see below) has been created
manually by human.

Cobalt Strike Beacon
DLL file diassvcs.dll is a loader/packer with some anti-analysis protections enabled. In
the picture below there is the unpacking routine consisting of decryption loops followed by
the calls to VirtualProtect Windows API and to the unpacked payload itself.

Fig. 4: Unpacking routine of DLL Loader from NSA ISO Sample
The unpacked payload is DLL file, but without standard MS-DOS header. This malformed
header can be often seen for example in Metasploit’s Meterpreter payloads and it is used
as a part of shellcode.

This DLL file is actually a Cobalt Strike Beacon. The extracted configuration is attached
below.

Cobalt Strike C2 Server
Analysis of Cobalt Strike C2 Server at content.pcmsar[.]net revealed couple of interesting
things. The server is hosted at Canadian OVH SAS hosting. It is powered by nginx
webserver, with Let’s Encrypt certificate issued on Mar 15 08:27:41 2021 GMT
(approximately one week before the Cobalt Strike Payload packed into ISO). Without any
parameters, the HTTP requests are redirected to https://spectator.sme.sk/, a popular
Slovakia’s English-language online newspaper.

Threat Actor C2 Infrastructure
Based on observations above (and couple of others) there is possible to discover more C2
servers. Some of them are hosted in OVH, and many of them have SSL/TLS certificates
issued by Sectigo instead of Let’s Encrypt. They are active since February 2021
(confirmed), but probably some of them was used also back in 2020. These C2 servers also

incorporated the redirection to innocent websites and they uses similar domains by
themselves. For example, C2 server hosted at cbdnewsandreviews[.]net redirects visitors to
https://www.newsreview.com//.
The discovered C2 servers are located around the globe, for example, in Canada, France
and Australia.

More Malware Samples
With information about C2 infrastructure, our researchers have found another malware
samples linked to the same threat actor. For example, another ISO called evil.iso. This file
is very similar to the analyzed “NSA” ISO, it contains LNK and DLL file with Cobalt Strike
Beacon payload. It was submitted to Any.Run on 26th February 2021 from Netherlands
(hypothesis is that the malware analyst used the ProtonVPN which is often used by them
for protecting their privacy). First submittion on VirusTotal is from 25th February, however,
the ISO file (with original name invitation.iso) was created most likely on 17th February in
Pacific Standard Timezone (UTC-08:00).

Delivery Method
Based on similarities of analyzed ISO files we were able to find another similar files. It
seems that at least some of them have been delivered via phishing emails with ISO/IMG
attachments looking like Word documents. Moreover, it seems that the same threat actor
delivers at least one phishing email to the targets in Czech republic in March 2021.

Findings and Summary
We were able to discover and track the campaign targeting Slovakia Government and
Cobalt Strike infrastructure used by the threat actor. This analysis was based solely on
publicly available information, community threat intelligence sources and our own malware
research. The incident and results have been reported to the local authorities such as
computer security incident response team. The report included the collected indicators of
compromise such as hashes and IP addresses. These IOCs have been used during the

8/11

investigation. Imagine, it is like the oraculum - you can predict which IP addresses will the
attacker use in the next steps, or, you can use the reported IOCs as a pivots during the
forensic analysis. All the results are only from the hunting in public sources.

We presented this case at Recon Village at DEF CON 29 conference in August 2021 (Las
Vegas & Virtual). We also introduced and explained couple of concepts, tips and tricks for
malware hunting and advanced search. Presentation slides and video from our talk are
available below.

Afterword
(updated on Sep 13, 2021)
This blog post was originally based on research and analysis during March and April 2021.
Therefore, we published our results based only on data available at that time, without
referring to the results and articles published a few weeks and months later.
Few days after DEF CON talk and after publishing this blog post, Slovak technology portal
Zive.sk wrote an article about this incident based on our research. Then, ESET Research
found that this attack targeted diplomats from more than 13 European countries and thinktanks and this attack was linked to APT29/Dukes/Nobelium also by Microsoft Threat
Intelligence Center. In their article from the end of May they published IOCs which contain
also some of the IOCs mentioned here, including “NSA” ISO Sample.
And finally, Catalin Cimpanu from The Record published post “Russian cyberspies targeted
the Slovak government for months” based on above work.
