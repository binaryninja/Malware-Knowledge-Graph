1/20

In May 2022, we reported on the Caramel skimmer-as-a-service and how the proliferation of
online credit card skimmers support fraud. Evidence suggests CaramelCorp, the group
behind the Caramel skimmer, does not limit their cybercrime activities to skimming. Instead,
this group appears to pivot frequently in search of profitable new lines of business using
different aliases with a documented history spanning several years. Such behavior is not
unusual; rather, this appears to be a trend where cybercriminals are quicker to adapt–and
expand to offer new services–in response to market forces.
Several factors contribute to this trend, but three are especially pertinent to this investigation.
First, cybercrime threat actors can (temporarily) avoid scrutiny from law enforcement by
appearing to be a small operation–a target simply not worth the effort to address, given the
significant increase in cybercrime and limited resources available to deter such behavior. A
cybercrime group that convincingly “appears small” can realize rich dividends. Second, savvy
cybercrime threat actors closely monitor the underground economy and evaluate new
opportunities in response to market forces. Third, increased specialization and reliance on
third party services within the underground economy makes expanding into new types of
cybercrime economical with minimal learning curve. The potential harm this trend can cause
for business and consumer alike should not be discounted, nor should adversary creativity or
their willingness to pivot in search of profits.
Despite its upside, such a trend is not without additional risk for cybercriminals. In exchange
for additional capabilities and revenue, cybercrime actors often increase exposure. One
helpful way to understand this relationship is through the lens of network defense and to
consider exposure in terms of attack surface: increased complexity and reliance on third
party services creates risk. If realized, that risk can become exploitable. Such is the case
with CaramelCorp, and these footholds help bring into focus a cluster of activity beyond
selling access to an online credit card skimmer. Instead, a portrait of a more ambitious group
with forays into stealer malware, dubious video game “hacks,” and cryptocurrency scams
begins to appear.

Domain Registrant “Ozil Verfig” and a Trail of Badness
The seeming simplicity of whois data belies immense complexity. Relationships between
registrant data and how domains relate can offer helpful insights when used judiciously.
Commonality – whether infrastructure or artifact – does not necessarily mean association or
shared endeavor. Not all roads lead to Rome and not all threads of an investigation lead to
the same suspect or conclusion. The art of threat intelligence is the ability to see multum in
parvo (“much in little”) without losing sight of the big picture. To do so is to be comfortable
with ambiguity, something cybercrime investigations are often fraught with. The domains in
CaramelCorp’s orbit and how they overlap with the domain registrant “Ozil Verfig” typify this
“big picture” approach.

2/20

In this case, several roads lead to CaramelCorp. Whois records for caramelcorp[.]cc offer
several useful initial footholds, the most helpful being:
Registrant Name: Ozil Verfig
Registrant Organization: Ozil Verfig
Registrant Street: Krasnaya Ploshad
Registrant City: Moscow
Registrant Postal Code: 101000
Registrant Country: RU
Registrant Phone: +495.1234321
Registrant Fax: +495.1234321Registrant Email: [email protected][.]com
Notably, the caramelcorp[.]cc domain appears to be controlled by a single registrant for its
entire history. The registrant organization name “Ozil Verfig ” and email address
“[email protected][.]com” seem distinctive. Further, the OSINT footprint associated with this
registrant is narrow but deep.
A review of caramelcorp[.]xyz, one of CaramelCorp’s earlier domains, also has “Ozil Verfig”
listed as the domain registrant’s organization. The name “Ozil Verfig” is unusual. Thus, the
relatively small footprint of domains with registrants and registrant organizations using the
name suggest relatedness. Further, many of these domains appear to fall into three
categories: (1) impersonation of financial institutions, (2) cryptocurrency scams, and (3)
malware domains, whether for propagation or administration (with possible ties to a notable
Redline stealer campaign). Given the cybercrime nexus, distinctive name, targeting behavior,
and frequently used domain registrars, it appears more likely than not that a single threat
actor or group is behind these domain registrations. Another factor to consider is whether
any similar domain naming conventions exist.
Registrant “Ozil Verfig” domains follow several consistent naming conventions for several
likely domain purpose groups. Some of these domains include:

* For purposes of this table, domain registrant and domain registrant organization are
combined.
Consistent domain naming conventions across several domain registrations and clustered
during specific time periods help define a nexus between CaramelCorp and whois records
that include “Ozil Verfig.” But how many of these domains are a signal instead of noise, and
does that signal relate to CaramelCorp? The answer is simple. One can begin to identify a
person in a crowd – even when everyone looks the same – based on their activities outside
of that crowd.

Forum presence of CaramelCorp promoter “letsz0ck3r”

Figure 1:

UfoLabs Russian-language hacking forum profile card for user “letsz0ck3r.”
First mentioned in our earlier report, the actor “letsz0ck3r” (also known as “Zocker” and likely
“or1kstar”) has a history of offering and promoting services on Russian-language cybercrime
forums (Figures 1-2). Some of these may include:
·

Selling “Star Stealer” malware that sends stolen data via Telegram (Figures 3-4)

·

Likely use of popular off-the-shelf malware (Anubis, Redline, Arkei)

·
5)

Offering cash-out and laundering services using US-based financial institutions (Figure

·

Selling malware encryption and digital signature services

·

Promoting a hidden virtual network computing (hVNC) module for sale

6/20

·

Video game mods and cheat systems (Figure 6)

Given the background of the Caramel skimmer, such products and services make sense
contextually. Of this list, most services are no longer offered. This could be in response to
market forces, improved technical abilities, and/or more profitable cybercrime niches.

where actor “Zocker” shares the Telegram handle @letsz0ck3r as part of their contact
information.

user “Zocker.”

of data and be largely undetectable by antivirus services.

8/20

Figure 5: Translation

of actor “Zocker” promoting their cash-out services.
Along with a Russian-language hacking forum presence, “letsz0ck3r” appears interested in
video game mods and cheat systems. Unsurprisingly, this actor maintains a presence on the
Phoenix video game hacking forum (Figure 6). They also appear to be a customer, which
could suggest an interest in gaming beyond exploitation. This activity proved to be especially
helpful in this investigation.

Figure 6: Examples of “letsz0ck3r” presence on the Phoenix video game hacking forum.
Notably, their activity appears to center around aimbots–videogame cheats that vastly
improve a player’s reaction time and aim by modifying game configuration files via code

injection as well as using other methods. These modifications almost always violate
multiplayer game terms of service.
Video game mods and cheat systems represent a tiny fraction of the underground economy,
but their context deserves particular attention. Video game mods are frequent malware
propagation vectors. Sometimes threat actors pair a game cheat system with malware;
others are rudimentary and simply install malware. The prospect of an unfair advantage in
online competitive games makes prospective targets much more likely to install them and
ignore antivirus alerts (see Figure 7 for an illustrative example). Because such cheat systems
often use code injection to operate, requests to disable Windows Defender entirely and run
the program with administrator-level privileges seem credible to prospective targets.
Malicious video game mods will often install stealer malware. Notably, DomainTools
Research monitors several Redline campaigns that use this precise propagation vector.

Figure 7: Description of an almost certainly malicious videogame cheat system from a
recently uploaded YouTube video. Used for illustrative purposes and without apparent ties to
CaramelCorp. After claiming “files are completely clean,” the guide then requests potential
victims disable Windows Smart Screen and Defender.
Several domains associated with CaramelCorp offer likely malicious video game mods and
cheat systems. These domains use the domain registrant organization “Ozil Verfig.” Some
examples include the domains valorannow[.]com and fortnightcheat[.]com (Figures 8-9).
Both appear to be slightly modified clones of other very suspicious video game mod
services.

activity, this game cheat engine targets Valorant players.

Figure 9: Screenshot of CaramelCorp-associated fortnightcheat[.]com. Likely tied to malware
activity, this game cheat engine targets Fortnite players.
But what more can one learn from domains and why would that matter? Sometimes threat
actors inadvertently reveal additional cybercrime activity. Here, a minor OPSEC mistake
suggests “letsz0ck3r” also has a keen interest in cryptocurrency scams. Their mistake: using
one domain for two very different types of scam.

Cryptocurrency scams
Cryptocurrency scams are legion, and CaramelCorp’s adoption of them should surprise no
one. The purpose of a cryptocurrency scam is primarily cryptocurrency theft (or, in some
cases, an attempt to install malware). More advanced cryptocurrency scams, referred to as
“drainers,” not only steal credentials and wallet recovery phrases–they also empty
cryptocurrency wallets and transfer the funds to an attacker-controlled wallet long before a
victim even realizes their mistake. These stolen funds are almost certainly unrecoverable
when transferred and, especially when laundered using privacy-focused cryptocurrencies,
exceedingly difficult to track by investigators.
A simpler cryptocurrency scam uses “airdrops,” “money flips,” and “crypto giveaways” as
lures to defraud victims. Each of these scams rely on the ruse that sending cryptocurrency
somewhere will result in a massive short-term return on investment. Victims lose all the
13/20

cryptocurrency they send, which is then laundered by fraudsters. Like drainers, funds stolen
using this scam are almost certainly unrecoverable. As economists have long said, there is
no free lunch.
And why are these scams becoming so commonplace? The answer is painfully
straightforward: they succeed, with victim losses in the billions of dollars. Another key driver
in the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency scams is decentralized finance (“DeFi”) paired
with the vast swath of cryptocurrency projects and services operating in the DeFi space.
Separating legitimate DeFi services from malicious ones can become difficult for even
experienced cryptocurrency traders.

A clearer picture of CaramelCorp with blurred lines
Importantly, overlap in cybercrime activity can occur on the same domain and help further
define a nexus of activity related to an actor group. Here, domains associated with
CaramelCorp have historical screenshots of both likely malicious video game cheats and
cryptocurrency scams within a relatively brief timeframe (Figures 10-11). The domain
skinchangenow[.]com is by no means the exception.

15/20

Figure 11: Cryptocurrency giveaway scam targeting Cardano holders at
skinchangenow[.]com.
The CaramelCorp-associated domain valorannow[.]com featured a cryptocurrency scam that
was replaced weeks later with a landing page for the very suspicious “ValorantCheats”
website (Figure 12).

16/20

Figure 12: DomainTools Iris Investigate screenshot history feature reveals how the domain
valorannow[.]com first began as a cryptocurrency giveaway scam.
Interestingly, a historical screenshot of another CaramelCorp-associated domain appears to
show a data table viewable by an unauthenticated user. The domain in question is
gotxest[.]top. This data table’s columns suggests its purpose was to collect skimmed
payment data (Figure 13):

Figure 13: What appears
to be a table for skimmed card data exposed to the public web at gotxest[.]top, another
domain associated with CaramelCorp.
Given CaramelCorp’s interest in online credit card skimming, this historical screenshot of
gotxest[.]top’ helps solidify further the nexus between “Ozil Verfig” domains and
CaramelCorp’s activities as a whole.
Taken together, a detailed portrait of CaramelCorp comes into focus. Instead of a skimmeras-a-service vendor, CaramelCorp represents a group focused on profit maximization that
pivots based on market signals, and–more importantly–one willing to learn from years of
experience. CaramelCorp’s behavior in this regard appears to be part of a trend, but not all is
lost for defenders. An analyst mindset combined with quality data sets allow defenders to
define, detect, and defend against threats promptly when threat actors pivot (or expand)
activities based on market shifts in the underground economy. Happy hunting.
