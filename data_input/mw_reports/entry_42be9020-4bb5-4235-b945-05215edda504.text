lnkr
lnkr is a malware campaign that injects scripts into web pages via malicious browser
extensions.
The campaign has been identified as belonging to Brocode, a shell company registered in
Hong Kong via startupr.com.hk. The attackers are believed to be Eastern European, likely
Ukrainian or Russian, but there's no indication that the effort is state-sponsored.
The attackers clone legitimate and semi-legitimate Chrome extensions. Scripts are added to
the clones that inject ads into every web page visited by the victim, in addition to potentially
sending sensitive data to C2 servers. The C2 communications are disguised as analytics
opt-out requests. The malicious code will falsely explain to the victim that the ads suppor the
development of the extension, but almost all of the affected extensions aren't developed by
the attackers.
The extension that I analyzed, Flash Player + 1.2.0, ID fanagokoaogopceablgmpndejhedkjjb,
was a modified, likely unauthorized clone of an extension of the same name, ID
fnipglnbhfacfmefbgiiodalehbcgcbm. The malicious clone has been removed from the Chrome
Web Store; the original remains.

1/9

The attackers make the attack difficult to block. Generic S3 bucket names are used, C2
domain names are frequently rotated, and C2 IP addresses are numerous and spread
across many hosting providers. C2 communications are disguised as opt-out requests.
Affected extensions appear widespread and affect a significant percentage of Englishspeaking Chrome users. The extensions are often removed from the Chrome store before
they can be analyzed, which makes it difficult to assess the number of affected extensions.
Concentrations appear to be in the United States and India.
At least one extension keeps a log of search keywords. It's not yet certain that this data is
stored and transmitted by lnkr, but preliminary evidence points to that conclusion.
The name lnkr appears to be the name used by the attackers. The boostrap scripts are
prefixed with lnkr , and some of the server-side C2 source code is in a folder named
lnkrApi . lnkr.us and lnkr.fr both appear to be controlled by the attackers.

Abuse report correspondence

3/9

I sent an abuse report to Amazon Web Services regarding the S3 buckets. Amazon didn't
remove the malicious code. When I questioned why, they forwarded me this response from
the attackers. (Some of the text is quoted from my original report; they appear to be
addressing the individual points I mentioned.)
Hello,
thanks for reaching us out regarding this issue.
1. Here is a Virustotal report for the object 'jscript-cdn/1f404c54c2b0e13e0f.js' :
https://www.virustotal.com/#/url/5f4279d8097fd1fd1c234e992a0c028146e5d102b
2a3636fe1a9db3b87240503/detection, as you can see only ESET alerts on this,
but from our latest case we figured out that it’s a false positive alert on the URL,
not for a script content, but haven’t got a reply from ESET so far. The same
situation is for 'jscript-cdn/1f65199417190d400c.js’.
Anyway this scripts are not in use at this time.
1. 'jscript-cdn/ is used to host scripts that are part of a malware campaign. The
attacker creates malicious duplicates of legitimate extensions in the Chrome web
store and injects these scripts into them. The ‘jscript-cdn’ is used to host scripts
for:
1. Monetization chrome extensions, firefox addons, websites and other web
applications.
2. Analytics scripts for browser extensions. If the script is used for
monetization, it’s completely MS and Google Compliance. Nor Monetization
of extensions nor Injecting ads in a proper way is not prohibited. There are
Extension’s Quality Quidlines and Single Purpose Policy. And of course
there is no malicious code inside, we check all scripts regularly and are
eager to keep them clean. If you find something suspicious in our scripts
please let us know and we’ll take the action immediately.
2. The link is to an old article about the extension that had been using monetization
script with search enhanced results, but the integration has been made incorrect
that’s why some important features, such as Opt Out from ads hadn't been work.
But the extension has been dropped from the store not for monetization
particularly but for violating single purpose policy.
User installs the extension from official chrome store, if he doesn’t like that the
extension is monetized with scripts he can easily remove the extension from his
browser and install alternative from the store. Usually our clients aware users in the
description of the extension that it contains the monetization scripts.
Best wishes, Brocode Team
