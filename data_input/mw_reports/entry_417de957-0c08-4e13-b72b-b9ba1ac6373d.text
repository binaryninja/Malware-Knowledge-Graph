Amid all the sleepless hours that Todd Leetham spent hunting ghosts inside his company’s
network in early 2011, the experience that sticks with him most vividly all these years later is
the moment he caught up with them. Or almost did.
It was a spring evening, he says, three days—maybe four, time had become a blur—after he
had first begun tracking the hackers who were rummaging through the computer systems of
RSA, the corporate security giant where he worked. Leetham—a bald, bearded, and
curmudgeonly analyst one coworker described to me as a “carbon-based hacker-finding
machine”—had been glued to his laptop along with the rest of the company’s incident
response team, assembled around the company’s glass-encased operations center in a
nonstop, 24-hours-a-day hunt. And with a growing sense of dread, Leetham had finally
traced the intruders’ footprints to their final targets: the secret keys known as “seeds,” a
collection of numbers that represented a foundational layer of the security promises RSA
made to its customers, including tens of millions of users in government and military
agencies, defense contractors, banks, and countless corporations around the world.

RSA kept those seeds on a single, well-protected server, which the company called the
“seed warehouse.” They served as a crucial ingredient in one of RSA's core products:
SecurID tokens—little fobs you carried in a pocket and pulled out to prove your identity by
entering the six-digit codes that were constantly updated on the fob's screen. If someone
could steal the seed values stored in that warehouse, they could potentially clone those
SecurID tokens and silently break the two-factor authentication they offered, allowing
hackers to instantly bypass that security system anywhere in the world, accessing anything
from bank accounts to national security secrets.
Now, staring at the network logs on his screen, it looked to Leetham like these keys to RSA’s
global kingdom had already been stolen.
Leetham saw with dismay that the hackers had spent nine hours methodically siphoning the
seeds out of the warehouse server and sending them via file-transfer protocol to a hacked
server hosted by Rackspace, a cloud-hosting provider. But then he spotted something that
gave him a flash of hope: The logs included the stolen username and password for that
hacked server. The thieves had left their hiding place wide open, in plain sight. Leetham
connected to the faraway Rackspace machine and typed in the stolen credentials. And there
it was: The server’s directory still contained the entire pilfered seed collection as a
compressed .rar file.
Using hacked credentials to log into a server that belongs to another company and mess
with the data stored there is, Leetham admits, an unorthodox move at best—and a violation
of US hacking laws at worst. But looking at RSA’s stolen holiest of holies on that Rackspace
server, he didn’t hesitate. “I was going to take the heat,” he says. “Either way, I'm saving our
shit.” He typed in the command to delete the file and hit enter.
Moments later, his computer’s command line came back with a response: “File not found.”
He examined the Rackspace server’s contents again. It was empty. Leetham’s heart fell
through the floor: The hackers had pulled the seed database off the server seconds before
he was able to delete it.
After hunting these data thieves day and night, he had “taken a swipe at their jacket as they
were running out the door,” as he says today. They had slipped through his fingers, escaping
into the ether with his company’s most precious information. And though Leetham didn’t yet
know it, those secrets were now in the hands of the Chinese military.

The RSA breach, when it became public days later, would redefine the cybersecurity
landscape. The company’s nightmare was a wake-up call not only for the information security
industry—the worst-ever hack of a cybersecurity firm to date—but also a warning to the rest
of the world. Timo Hirvonen, a researcher at security firm F-Secure, which published an
outside analysis of the breach, saw it as a disturbing demonstration of the growing threat
posed by a new class of state-sponsored hackers. “If a security company like RSA cannot
protect itself,” Hirvonen remembers thinking at the time, “how can the rest of the world?”
The question was quite literal. The theft of the company's seed values meant that a critical
safeguard had been removed from thousands of its customers’ networks. RSA's SecurID
tokens were designed so that institutions from banks to the Pentagon could demand a
second form of authentication from their employees and customers beyond a username and
password—something physical in their pocket that they could prove they possessed, thus
proving their identity. Only after typing in the code that appeared on their SecurID token (a
code that typically changed every 60 seconds) could they gain access to their account.
The SecurID seeds that RSA generated and carefully distributed to its customers allowed
those customers’ network administrators to set up servers that could generate the same
codes, then check the ones users entered into login prompts to see if they were correct.
Now, after stealing those seeds, sophisticated cyberspies had the keys to generate those
codes without the physical tokens, opening an avenue into any account for which someone’s
username or password was guessable, had already been stolen, or had been reused from
another compromised account. RSA had added an extra, unique padlock to millions of doors
around the internet, and these hackers now potentially knew the combination to every one.
This past December, when it became public that the company SolarWinds was hacked by
Russian spies, the world woke up to the notion of a “supply chain attack”: a technique in
which an adversary compromises a point of vulnerability in a software or hardware supplier
positioned upstream from—and out of sight of—its target, a blind spot in the victim's view of
their cybersecurity risks. The Kremlin operatives who hacked SolarWinds hid espionage
code in an IT management tool called Orion, used by as many as 18,000 companies and
institutions globally.
Using the SolarWinds supply chain compromise, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, known
as the SVR, penetrated deep into at least nine US federal agencies, including the State
Department, the US Treasury, the Department of Justice, and NASA. In another worldshaking supply chain attack just a few years earlier, Russia’s military intelligence agency,
known as the GRU, hijacked a piece of obscure Ukrainian accounting software to push out a
data-destroying worm known as NotPetya, inflicting $10 billion in damage worldwide in the
worst cyberattack in history.
For those with a longer memory, though, the RSA breach was the original massive supply
chain attack. State cyberspies—who were later revealed to be working in the service of
China’s People’s Liberation Army—penetrated infrastructure relied on across the globe to
3/11

protect the internet. And in doing so, they pulled the rug out from under the entire world’s
model of digital security. “It opened my eyes to supply chain attacks,” says Mikko Hypponen,
chief research officer at F-Secure, who worked with Hirvonen on the company's analysis of
the RSA breach. “It changed my view of the world: the fact that, if you can’t break into your
target, you find the technology that they use and break in there instead.”
In the decade that followed, many key RSA executives involved in the company’s breach
have held their silence, bound by 10-year nondisclosure agreements. Now those agreements
have expired, allowing them to tell me their stories in new detail. Their accounts capture the
experience of being targeted by sophisticated state hackers who patiently and persistently
take on their most high-value networked targets on a global scale, where an adversary
sometimes understands the interdependencies of its victims’ systems better than victims do
themselves, and is willing to exploit those hidden relationships.
After 10 years of rampant state-sponsored hacking and supply chain hijacks, the RSA
breach can now be seen as the herald of our current era of digital insecurity—and a lesson
about how a determined adversary can undermine the things we trust most.
On March 8, 2011, a brisk late-winter day, Todd Leetham finished a smoke break and was
walking back into RSA’s headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts—a pair of connected
buildings on the edge of a forest in the Boston suburbs—when a systems administrator
pulled him aside and asked him to take a look at something strange.
The admin had noticed that one user had accessed a server from a PC that the user didn’t
typically work on, and that the permissions setting on the account seemed unusual. A
technical director investigating the anomalous login with Leetham and the admin asked Bill
Duane, a veteran RSA engineer, to take a look. To Duane, who was busy working on a
cryptographic algorithm at the time, the anomaly hardly looked like cause for alarm. “I frankly
thought this administrator was crazy,” he remembers. “Fortunately he was stubborn enough
to insist that something was wrong.”
Leetham and the company’s security incident responders started to trace the aberrant
behavior and analyze the forensics of every machine the anomalous account had touched.
They began to see more telltale oddities in employees’ credentials, stretching back days.
The admin had been right. "Sure enough,” Duane says, “this was the tip of the iceberg.”
Over the next several days, the security team at RSA’s security operations center—a NASAstyle control room with rows of desks and monitors covering one wall—meticulously traced
the interlopers’ fingerprints. The RSA staffers began putting in nearly 20-hour workdays,
driven by the chilling knowledge that the breach they were tracking was still unfolding.
Management demanded updates on their findings every four hours, day or night.

4/11

The analysts eventually traced the origin of the breach to a single malicious file that they
believed had landed on an RSA employee’s PC five days before they’d started their hunt. A
staffer in Australia had received an email with the subject line “2011 Recruitment plan” and
an Excel spreadsheet attached to it. He'd opened it. Inside the file was a script that exploited
a zero-day vulnerability—a secret, unpatched security flaw—in Adobe Flash, planting a
common piece of malicious software called Poison Ivy on the victim’s machine.
That initial point of entry onto RSA’s network, F-Secure’s Hirvonen would later point out in his
own analysis, wasn't particularly sophisticated. A hacker wouldn’t have even been able to
exploit the Flash vulnerability if the victim had been running a more recent version of
Windows or Microsoft Office, or if he’d had limited access to install programs on his PC—as
most security administrators for corporate and government networks recommend, Hirvonen
says.
But it was from this ingress that the RSA analysts say the intruders began to demonstrate
their real abilities. In fact, several RSA executives came to believe that at least two groups of
hackers were in their network simultaneously—one highly skilled group exploiting the other’s
access, perhaps, with or without their knowledge. “There’s the trail through the woods that
the first one left, and right in the middle of it, branching off, is the second trail,” says Sam
Curry, who was RSA’s chief security officer at the time. “And that second attack was much
more skilled.”
On that Australian employee’s PC, someone had used a tool that pulled credentials out of
the machine's memory and then reused those usernames and passwords to log into other
machines on the network. They’d then scraped those computers’ memories for more
usernames and passwords—finding some that belonged to more privileged administrators.
The hackers eventually got to a server containing hundreds of users’ credentials. Today that
credential-stealing hopscotching technique is common. But in 2011 the analysts were
surprised to see how the hackers fanned out across the network. “It was really just the most
brutal way to blow through our systems that I’d ever seen,” Duane says.
Breaches as extensive as the one carried out against RSA are often discovered months after
the fact, when the intruders are long gone or lying dormant. But Duane says that the 2011
incident was different: Within days, the investigators had essentially caught up to the
intruders and were watching them in action. “They’d try to get into a system, then we’d detect
them a minute or two later and go in and shut down that system or disable access to it,”
Duane says. “We were fighting them tooth and nail, in real time.”
It was in the midst of that feverish chase that Leetham caught the hackers stealing what he
still believes was their highest-priority target: the SecurID seeds.
RSA executives told me that the part of their network responsible for manufacturing the
SecurID hardware tokens was protected by an “air gap”—a total disconnection of computers
from any machine that touches the internet. But in fact, Leetham says, one server on RSA’s
5/11

internet-connected network was linked, through a firewall that allowed no other connections,
to the seed warehouse on the manufacturing side. Every 15 minutes, that server would pull
off a certain number of seeds so that they could be encrypted, written to a CD, and given to
SecurID customers. That link was necessary; it allowed RSA’s business side to help
customers set up their own server that could then check users’ six-digit code when it was
typed into a login prompt. Even after the CD was shipped to a client, those seeds remained
on the seed warehouse server as a backup if the customer’s SecurID server or its setup CD
were somehow corrupted.
Now, instead of the usual once-every-15-minutes connections, Leetham saw logs of
thousands of continuous requests for data every second. What’s more, the hackers had
been collecting those seeds on not one but three compromised servers, relaying requests
through the one connected machine. They had packaged up the collection of seeds in three
parts, moved them off to the faraway Rackspace server, and then recombined them into
what appeared to be the full database of every seed RSA had stored in the seed warehouse.
“I was like, ‘Wow ,’” Leetham says. “I kind of admired it. But at the same time: ‘Oh crap.’”
As it dawned on Leetham that the seed collection had likely been copied—and after he had
made his seconds-too-late attempt to delete the data off the hackers’ server—the enormity of
the event hit him: The trust that customers placed in RSA, perhaps its most valuable
commodity, was about to be obliterated. “This is an extinction event,” he remembers thinking.
“RSA is over.”
It was late at night when the security team learned that the seed warehouse had been
plundered. Bill Duane made the call: They would physically cut off as many of RSA’s network
connections as necessary to limit the damage and stop any further theft of data. They hoped,
in particular, to protect any customer information that mapped to the seeds, and which might
be necessary for the hackers to exploit them. (Some RSA staff also suggested to me that the
seeds had been stored in an encrypted state, and cutting off network connections was
intended to prevent the hackers from stealing the key necessary to decrypt them.) Duane
and an IT manager walked into the data center and started unplugging Ethernet cables one
by one, severing the company’s connections to its manufacturing facility, parts of its network
that handled core business processes like customer orders, even its website. “I basically
shut off RSA’s business,” he says. “I crippled the company in order to stop any potential
further release of data.”
The next day, RSA’s CEO, Art Coviello, was in a meeting in the conference room that
adjoined his office, preparing a public statement about the ongoing breach. Coviello had
been getting updates since the intrusions were discovered. As the extent of the breach had
grown, he’d canceled a business trip to Brazil. But he’d remained relatively sanguine. After
all, it didn’t sound like the hackers had breached any credit card data or other sensitive
customer information. They’d kick out the hackers, he figured, post their statement, and get
on with business.

6/11

But in the middle of the meeting, he remembers, a marketing executive at the table with him
looked at her phone and murmured, “Oh dear.”
Coviello asked her what was wrong. She demurred. He took the phone out of her hand and
read the message. It said that Bill Duane was coming up to Coviello’s office; he wanted to
update the CEO in person. When he got upstairs, he delivered the news: The hackers had
reached the SecurID seeds. “I felt like a cannonball had been shot through my stomach,”
Coviello says.
In the hours that followed, RSA’s executives debated how to go public. One person in legal
suggested they didn’t actually need to tell their customers, Sam Curry remembers. Coviello
slammed a fist on the table: They would not only admit to the breach, he insisted, but get on
the phone with every single customer to discuss how those companies could protect
themselves. Joe Tucci, the CEO of parent company EMC, quickly suggested they bite the
bullet and replace all 40 million-plus SecurID tokens. But RSA didn’t have nearly that many
tokens available—in fact, the breach would force it to shut down manufacturing. For weeks
after the hack, the company would only be able to restart production in a diminished
capacity.
As the recovery effort got under way, one executive suggested they call it Project Phoenix.
Coviello immediately nixed the name. “Bullshit,” he remembers saying. “We're not rising from
the ashes. We're going to call this project Apollo 13. We're going to land the ship without
injury.”
At 7:00 the next morning, March 17, RSA’s head of North American sales, David Castignola,
finished up an early workout on a treadmill at his local gym in Detroit. When he picked up his
phone, he saw that he had missed no fewer than 12 calls—all from just that morning, and all
from RSA’s president, Tom Haiser. RSA, Haiser’s voicemails said, was about to announce a
major security breach. He needed to be in the building.
A few hours and a last-minute flight later, Castignola literally ran into RSA’s headquarters in
Bedford and up to the fourth-floor conference room. He immediately noticed the pale, drawn
faces of the staff who had been dealing with the unfolding crisis for more than a week. “Every
little indicator I got was: This is worse than I can even get my head around,” Castignola
remembers.
That afternoon, Coviello published an open letter to RSA’s customers on the company’s
website. “Recently, our security systems identified an extremely sophisticated cyberattack in
progress,” the letter read. “While at this time we are confident that the information extracted
does not enable a successful direct attack on any of our RSA SecurID customers, this
information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor
authentication implementation as part of a broader attack,” the letter continued—somewhat
downplaying the crisis.

7/11

In Bedford, Castignola was given a conference room and the authority to ask for as many
volunteers from the company as he needed. A rotating group of nearly 90 staffers began the
weeks-long, day-and-night process of arranging one-on-one phone calls with every
customer. They worked from a script, walking customers through protective measures like
adding or lengthening a PIN number as part of their SecurID logins, to make them harder for
hackers to replicate. Castignola remembers walking down the halls of the building at 10 pm
and hearing calls on speaker phones behind every closed door. In many cases customers
were shouting. Castignola, Curry, and Coviello each did hundreds of those calls; Curry
began to joke that his title was “chief apology officer.”
At the same time, paranoia was beginning to take hold in the company. The first night after
the announcement, Castignola remembers walking by a wiring closet and seeing an absurd
number of people walking out of it, far more than he imagined could have ever fit. “Who are
those people?” he asked another nearby executive. “That’s the government,” the executive
responded vaguely.
In fact, by the time Castignola had landed in Massachusetts, both the NSA and the FBI had
been called to help the company’s investigation, as had defense contractor Northrop
Grumman and incident response firm Mandiant. (By chance, employees of Mandiant had
already been on-site prior to the breach, installing security sensor equipment on RSA’s
network.)
RSA staff began to take drastic measures. Worried that their phone system might be
compromised, the company switched carriers, moving from AT&T to Verizon phones.
Executives, not trusting even the new phones, held meetings in person and shared paper
copies of documents. The FBI, fearing an accomplice in RSA's ranks because of the
apparent level of knowledge the intruders seemed to have of company systems, started
doing background checks. “I made sure that all members of the team—I don't care who they
were, what reputation they had—were investigated, because you have to be sure,” Duane
says.
The windows of some executives’ offices and conference rooms were covered in layers of
butcher paper, to prevent laser microphone surveillance—a long-distance eavesdropping
technique that picks up conversations from vibrations in window panes—by imagined spies
in the surrounding woods. The building was swept for bugs. Multiple executives insisted that
they did find hidden listening devices—though some were so old that their batteries were
dead. It was never clear if those bugs had any relation to the breach.
Meanwhile, RSA’s security team and the investigators brought in to help were “tearing the
house down to the studs,” as Curry put it. In every part of the network that the hackers
touched, he says, they scrubbed the contents of potentially compromised machines—and
even ones adjacent to them. “We physically went around and, if there was a box they were
on, it got wiped,” Curry says. “If you lost data, too bad.”

8/11

In late May 2011, about two months after the breach announcement, RSA was still
recovering, rebuilding, and apologizing to customers when it was hit with an aftershock: A
post appeared on the influential tech blogger Robert X. Cringely’s website, titled “InsecureID:
No More Secrets?”
The post was based on a tip from a source inside a major defense contractor, who’d told
Cringely that the company was responding to an extensive intrusion by hackers who seemed
to have used stolen RSA seed values to get in. Everyone at the defense contractor was
having their RSA tokens replaced. Suddenly RSA's breach seemed far more severe than the
company’s original announcement had described it. “Well it didn’t take long for whoever
cracked RSA to find a lock to fit that key,” Cringely wrote. “What if every RSA token has been
compromised, everywhere?”
Two days later, Reuters revealed the name of the hacked military contractor: Lockheed
Martin, a company that represented a cornucopia of ultra-secret plans for weapons and
intelligence technologies. “The scab was healing,” Castignola says. “Then Lockheed hit. That
was like a mushroom cloud. We were back at it again.”
In the days that followed, defense contractors Northrop Grumman and L-3 were also named
in news reports. Hackers with SecurID’s seed values had targeted them too, the stories said,
though it was never clear how deeply the intruders had penetrated the companies. Nor was it
revealed what the hackers had accessed inside Lockheed Martin. The company claimed it
had prevented the spies from stealing sensitive information like customer data or classified
secrets.
In another open letter to customers in early June 2011, RSA’s Art Coviello admitted, “We
were able to confirm that information taken from RSA in March had been used as an element
of an attempted broader attack on Lockheed Martin, a major US government defense
contractor.”
Today, with 10 years of hindsight, Coviello and other former RSA executives tell a story that
starkly contradicts accounts from the time: Most of the former RSA staff who spoke to me
claim that it was never proven that SecurID had any role in the Lockheed breach. Coviello,
Curry, Castignola, and Duane all argued that it was never confirmed that the intruders inside
RSA’s systems had successfully stolen the full list of seed values in an uncorrupted,
unencrypted form, nor the customer list mapped to those seeds necessary to exploit them. “I
don't think that Lockheed’s attack was related to us at all,” Coviello states flatly.
By contrast, in the years since 2011, Lockheed Martin has detailed how hackers used
information stolen in RSA’s SecurID breach as a stepping stone to penetrate its network—
even as it insists that no information was successfully stolen in that event. A Lockheed
source with knowledge of the company’s incident response reaffirmed to WIRED the
company’s original claims. “We stand by our forensic investigation findings,” the source says.
“Our analysis determined the breach of our two-factor authentication token provider was a
9/11

direct contributing factor in the attack on our network, a fact that has been widely reported by
the media and acknowledged publicly by our vendor, including Art.” In fact, the Lockheed
source says the company saw the hackers entering SecurID codes in real time, confirmed
that the targeted users hadn’t lost their tokens, and then, after replacing those users’ tokens,
watched the hackers continue to unsuccessfully enter codes from the old tokens.
The NSA, for its part, has never had much doubt about RSA’s role in subsequent break-ins.
In a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee a year after the RSA breach, NSA’s
director, General Keith Alexander, said that the RSA hack “led to at least one US defense
contractor being victimized by actors wielding counterfeit credentials,” and that the
Department of Defense had been forced to replace every RSA token it used.
In the hearing, Alexander went on to pin those attacks, vaguely, on an increasingly common
culprit: China. The New York Times and the security firm Mandiant would later publish a
groundbreaking exposé on a Chinese state hacker group that Mandiant had named APT1.
The group was believed to be People’s Liberation Army Unit 61398, based on the outskirts of
Shanghai. Among its dozens of targets over the previous five years: the governments of the
United States, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam; and the United Nations—and RSA.
After those reports became public, Bill Duane printed out a picture of the hackers’
headquarters, a 12-story white building off of Shanghai’s Datong Road. He taped it to a
dartboard in his office.
I asked Duane, who retired from RSA in 2015 after more than 20 years at the company, at
what point he considered RSA’s breach truly over: Was it the morning after he made the
lonely decision to unplug a chunk of the company’s network? Or when the NSA, the FBI,
Mandiant, and Northrop had wrapped up and left? “Our view was that the attack wasn’t ever
over,” he responds. “We knew that they left backdoors, that they’re always going to be able
to break in, that the attacker can, with their resources, get in when they want to get in.”
Duane’s harrowing experience in response to the intrusion taught him—and perhaps should
teach all of us—that “every network is dirty,” as he puts it. Now he preaches to companies
that they should segment their systems and cordon off their most sensitive data so that it
remains impenetrable even to an adversary that’s already inside the firewall.
As for Todd Leetham, he watched the SolarWinds fiasco unfold over the past six months with
a grim sense of déjà vu. “Everybody was shocked. But in hindsight, well, duh, it was kind of
everywhere,” he says of SolarWinds. As was, by analogy, SecurID, 10 years earlier.
Leetham sees the lessons of RSA’s supply chain compromise in starker terms than even his
colleague Bill Duane: It was “a glimpse of just how fragile the world is,” he says. “It’s a house
of cards during a tornado warning.”

10/11

SolarWinds demonstrated how precarious this structure remains, he argues. As Leetham
sees it, the security world blindly put its trust in something that existed outside its threat
model, never imagining that an adversary might attack it. And once again, the adversary
pulled out a supporting card underpinning the house’s foundation—one that had been
confused for solid ground.
