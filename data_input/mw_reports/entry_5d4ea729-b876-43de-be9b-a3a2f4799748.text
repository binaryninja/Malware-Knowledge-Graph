Taking the bait: The modus operandi of massive social engineering waves impacting
banks in Portugal in the last two years.
A massive social engineering campaign has been disseminated at least in the last two years
in Portugal. The waves have impacted banking organizations with the goal of stealing the
users’ secrets, accessing the home banking portals, and also controlling all the operations on
the fly via Command and Control (C2) servers geolocated in Brazil.
In this article, we will understand the modus operandi of this wide campaign, how the
phishing templates are disseminated, how victims’ are triggered, dig into the details of the
phishing templates and C2 server source-code, and learn how criminals are orchestrating all
the operations.

Overview
A wide social engineering campaign affecting bank users’ in Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Mexico,
Chile, the UK, and France has been disseminated and operated by Brazilian criminals at
least in the last two years. Although users of many countries have been impacted, this article
will focus whenever possible only on the Portuguese waves.
As documented in the past, a lot of malicious templates have been developed and updated
by criminals to lure victims to share their home banking credentials on fake templates. As
usual, the phishing email templates are incredibly similar to the original emails, with the
exception of the content provided. Nevertheless, the campaign is not just about collecting
data through a landing page: criminals are able to control every step of the infection
chain, asking the victim for additional details via C2 servers in real-time. This campaign has
been observed since 2019 in Portugal and is depicted in Figure 1 below.

1/37

Figure 1: High-level diagram of the social engineering infection chain. Victims are triggered
via phishing, spear-phishing, or smishing waves, and the observed landing pages can have
two distinct forms. Users’ details are collected offline or on the fly orchestration via C2 is
performed by criminals.

Key findings
Criminals target victims from different countries and collect details from home
banking portals and payment cards.
The criminals geolocated in Brazil have a list of target phone numbers and emails
used to trigger victims in spear-phishing campaigns.
The criminals can use two different phishkits engines.
The compromised data can be accessed by criminals in offline mode by
accessing the server where the landing page is running. The data is transferred
via FTP or web pannels, and further access is performed to the banking portal.
On the other side, an orchestration schema in real-time can be used to control
every step of the infection chain. With this mechanism in place, the infection
process is as real as possible to the legitimate system. Criminals can
impersonate the victims and access the legitimate service in real-time while
details are requested via the fake page.

Genesis: The initial trigger
The smishing way
Everything starts with smishing (SMS) or spear-phishing campaigns (fake emails). Smishing
is leveraged through a wordlist of valid and processed phone numbers acquired by criminals
from other criminal groups that sell this type of content – including emails – on underground
forums and Telegram or Discord channels.

2/37

Figure 2: How criminals are obtaining phone numbers and emails to trigger victims’.
Interesting to notice that these groups are looking for Fully Undetectable (FUD) malware to
target victims. We believe this thread is related to the acquisition of the source code of the
URSA trojan detailed here.
The smishing campaign is started by using SMS API services from third-party companies to
release the trigger.

3/37

Figure 3: Smishing campaigns executed by criminals to target victims according to several
lists grouped by countries.

The spear-phishing method
The spear-phishing campaigns are executed in the same way. A list of emails is acquired
and a well-designed template impersonating the legitimate organizations is sent to the
victims’ inbox. Figure 4 below presents some of the templates disseminated in the last weeks
in Portugal.

4/37

Figure 4: Phishing email templates disseminated in Portugal during the last weeks of 2021.
As usual, the email body has hardcoded a malicious URL specially crafted by criminals via
shortURL systems. The following image illustrates some malicious domains created on the
bit[.]do service by criminals.

5/37

Figure 5: Short-URLs created by criminals and used in several campaigns in the wild.
These kinds of campaigns fully target a group of users, spear-phishing. For this, criminals
perform initial triage, before directing the victim to the malicious landing page.
In detail, a redirector system accessed after clicking on the malicious link sent via email is
responsible for validating whether the email passed through a URL parameter is contained in
a pre-computed list, which demonstrates that phishing campaigns are totally targeted to a
group of users.
This redirector is composed of the following URL path: malicious_domain/redir or
malicious_domain/?cliente=xxx.
As observed below, the redirector system includes some features, namely:
A list of blocked domains
A blacklist of IP addresses; and
A logging mechanism to keep the victims’ details (date and hour, OS
version, email, IP address, and web-browser details.

6/37

Figure 6: Black-list mechanisms and logging procedure available on the redirector system.
Figure 6 shows that requests from IP ranges and CIDR /32 IP addresses are blocked and
the same procedure is also applied to domains and email addresses.
Digging into de details, the files “xadm.php” e “xblock.php” allow a web interaction to
facilitate the block of IP addresses and email addresses. The local database is comprised of
2 TXT files (“xblock-ip.txt” and “xblock-mail.txt”). On the other hand, the log of operations
and victims’ accesses are kept in the files “xerror.txt” and “xreg.txt“.

7/37

Figure 7: File tree of the phishing redirector.
The used authentication mechanism is straightforward. The files are protected by a
hardcoded password, and the entire procedure is carried out with the TXT files (the
database), as mentioned before. Some details about the redirector source code are below.

Figure 8: Details about the authentication mechanism and TXT files that support all the
redirector operations.
Among other highlights, the index.php file is responsible for some additional checks in order
to “redirect” the victim to the final landing page.

8/37

Figure 9: Initial validation when a victim request (HTTP-request) is received.
Next, some extra validations are performed in order to circumvent automatic requests from
cyber security systems, Internet bots, security experts, and so on. As highlighted below, the
victim is then redirected to the final landing page available on another web server if the initial
request matches all the steps with success.

Figure 10: Extra validations executed by the phishing redirector system – a triage process to
evade automatic requests and Internet bots, security systems, etc.

Phishkits: How landing pages operate
9/37

In general, we are scrutinizing two different phishkits in this article, namely:
A simple landing page (without C2) with the goal of only collecting
credentials to access the home banking portal and other details such as
SMS tokens and bank codes; and
A landing page orchestrated via local C2 panel and also another huge
schema with central C2 servers geolocated in Brazil.

Simplest way: a single landing page without a C2 mechanism
This type of architecture typically uses TXT files to store the victims’ data in raw format.
Criminals further access servers and download details via FTP or web pannels. The landing
pages are also equipped with a notification mechanism, where the feed with the victims’ data
is sent to a Telegram channel or even via email by using the SMTP protocol.
Some of the landing pages observed in Portugal within this context are presented below.

10/37

Figure 11: Example of landing pages observed in Portugal during the last weeks of 2021.
In order to control and check the number of infections, these phishkits have embedded a
victims’ log feature as demonstrated below. In this sense, criminals are able to control how
many victims were infected and decide when the right moment to collect and download the
data. In some cases, the access is performed via VPN services, otherwise, from residential
Brazilian IP addresses.

11/37

Figure 12: 898 victims’ (accesses) were targeted in this phishkit – many of them valid
accesses, and with legitimate information stored on the server and collected by criminals.
It’s interesting to notice the criminals do not delete the 1st infection from the logging file,
every time with their residential IP address. Due to the lack observed, it’s straightforward to
track the groups behind these kinds of schemas based on their geolocation (to let the cat out
of the bag).
As previously mentioned, the collected data is stored inside TXT files and images with bank
codes also uploaded into specific folders (left-side), and the detail can also be sent simply
via email with the banking code images as attachments (right-side).

12/37

Figure 13: Example of how the victims’ details are stored on the webserver or simply sent to
the criminals’ email inboxes via SMTP protocol.

Orchestration on the fly
13/37

In this section, 5 different phishkits of orchestrator systems are presented. All of them
operate more or less within the same model:
The victim accesses the landing page; and
Criminals control all the steps by using a C2 panel available on the same
webserver or a C2 server geolocated in Brazil.
Regarding this orchestration C2s, criminals are able to request details step-by-step in realtime, as illustrated below.

#Phishkit 1

Figure 14: Phishkit with a C2 panel available on the same server. All the data is requested
step by step by operators.
As seen, on the same server where the phishing page is hosted, a C2 panel is included. This
panel allows step-by-step control of the data requested from victims. In the image above, the
dashboard and a window where the request for 3 banking card values (secret code) is made.
The victims’ details are stored on the server by using a MySQL database, usually configured
via the Cpanel Host Manager system.

14/37

Figure 15: #phishkit 1 source-code details.

#Phishkit 2
This scenario presents a similar process as described previously. A C2 panel available in the
same server is used to control the flow on the fly by operators.

15/37

Figure 16: #phishkit 2 landing page and C2 panel.
Malicious operators can choose what type of data they want to request, and the information
is stored on a MySQL database, just like on #phiskit 1.

#Phishkit 3
In this phishkit, the same modus operandi is used. The data is requested in a C2 panel on
the server, but this time the details are stored in TXT.

16/37

Figure 17: #phishkit 3 – landing page and C2 panel.
Instead of using a DBMS, this particular phishikit manages everything with TXT files. The
PHP files are responsible for creating, editing, or even deleting information from the TXT files
(the database of the malicious schema).

Figure 18: TXT files that stored the victims’ data in raw format. The files are accessed (and
edited) from the PHP pages of the C2 panel.
As expected, criminals must access the webserver to download all the details.

#Phishkit 4
This phishkit is built differently from the previous ones. Rather than using a panel to request
data in stages, it only collects the access credentials and makes automated requests to
validate the credentials in real-time. In addition, the phishkit extracts information from the
legitimate servers/portals in order to populate the malicious database, including the victim’s
name, credit card (number, date, and CVV number), account balance, etc.

17/37

18/37

Figure 19: #phishkit 4 – landing page, C2 panel, and API details used probably to feed a C2
server in the background.
This phiskit uses an API that exposes the information to be collected by a C2 in the
background. Next, criminals can use them to perform other tasks.

#Phishkit 5
The #phiskit 5 has been used at least for the last 2 years in Portugal. The landing pages are
launched on newly registered domains, either on the same day the campaign is
disseminated or during the night to avoid their detection. The landing pages all communicate
with C2 servers geolocated in Brazil and controlled on the fly by criminals.
Figure 20 shows some of the landing pages used by criminals.

19/37

Figure 20: Landing pages used by criminals – #phishkit 5.
These C2 servers have ben use used in different types of campaigns around the globe,
mainly to execute and control:
phishing campaigns via landing pages
infections via conventional banking malware (Windows OS); and
infections via malicious APK (Android banking trojan).
As observed below, the C2 operators can request data step-by-step via a tailored way.

20/37

Figure 21: #phishkit 5- one of the C2 servers geolocated in Brazil.
Notice that the “ANUBIS” operator was highlighted because the same user appeared in a
very similar campaign – ANUBIS NETWORK – THE EVOLUTION OF THE PHISHING
SCHEMA. This can be a clear sign that the same group is operating these C2 servers as
well.

21/37

Figure 22: Similarities of the #phishkit 5 operators vs Anubis operators.
More details about the Anubis phishing infrastructure analysis are below.

Returning to this analysis, another C2 server also operated by the same group and using the
same modus operandi – but with a slightly different design – was observed operating only in
Latin America. Some screens are presented below.

Figure 23: C2 server operated by the same group only in Latin American countries.
As mentioned above, The C2 server under analysis is also used to control infections via
malicious APK. The following screen is a clear indicator of that.

The infection process using these C2 servers can be observed in the video provided below,
which exemplifies how the information is requested step-by-step by the operators.
Another video referring to another campaign can also be viewed here.
The C2 servers have a MySQL database used to keep and control all the operations, and
several replicas are available on different servers geolocated in Brazil.

Figure 25: #Phishkit 5 – MySQL databases and some of the available tables with target
companies.
In detail, C2 was developed based on a well-structured pillar, where minimal information is
sent to landing pages during the infection process. Figure 26 below presents the #phishkit 5
file tree (source-code).

24/37

Figure 26: #phishkit 5: file tree.
As observed, this C2 server is capable of spawning new domains based on available apache
.config files. The process is completely automated, allowing criminals not to waste too much
time setting up new domains.

Below is presented the complete list of configuration files available in one of the C2 servers
along with the targeted organizations:

On the other way, the “gerente_” PHP files are the orchestrators for each target brand,
when the mentioned options/commands are available and coded.

34/37

Figure 29: Source code of the gerente PHP files – C2 commands.
Regarding the users’ permissions, the system includes two different user roles:
Administrator; and
Operators.
The operators have the role of managing and controlling infections, requesting data, and
finalizing the malicious process. In contrast, the administrator is capable of adding new
users, editing users, configuring new spawners (phishing domains), enabling more target
brands, and so on. Details and part of the source code about these features are present in
Figure 30.

Final Thoughts
Phishing and malware campaigns make headlines every day. Phishing scams in particular
have increased in volume and sophistication in recent years, making early detection hard.
There are several groups utilizing this type of scheme and obtaining email lists, malware,
and FUD codes from underground forums, that are mainly paid via cryptocurrencies (Monero
and Bitcoin). Many groups operate both phishing and malware campaigns at the same time,

36/37

e.g. trojan URSA seems to be also operated by the same group of the C2 server
analyzed above.
In this sense, monitoring these types of IoCs is a crucial point now, as it is expected that in
the coming weeks or months new infections or waves can appear.
From the Internet end users’ point of view, it’s important to equip them with strategies to fight
this emerging threat and provide train in general. For instance, every time we receive an
email from the bank, we need to question ourselves:
Can the bank ask for my secrets by email? (it’s a trap)
Am I in debt or do I have to pay something to the bank? (it’s a trap) … just
confirm the situation, call by phone.
Let me check the FROM address … seems weird (it’s a trap)
If I click on the URL inside the email, first I need to check out the domain …
probably it will not be the official one
(it’s a trap again)
Let me check if the certification authority is the same as the official home banking
