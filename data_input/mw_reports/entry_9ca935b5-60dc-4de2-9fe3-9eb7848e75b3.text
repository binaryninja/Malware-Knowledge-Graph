ESET researchers discover a previously unreported cyberespionage platform used in targeted
attacks against diplomatic missions and governmental institutions, and privacy-concerned users
Zuzana Hromcová 10 Oct 2019 - 11:30AM
ESET researchers have discovered a new espionage platform with a complex
architecture, a host of measures to make detection and analysis more difﬁcult and
two notable features. First, its GSM plugin uses the AT command protocol, and
second, it uses Tor for its network communications. ESET researchers thus named the
cyberespionage platform Attor.

Targets
Attor’s espionage operation is highly targeted – we were able to trace Attor’s operation back to at
least 2013, yet we only identiﬁed a few dozen victims. Despite that, we were able to learn more
about the intended victims by analyzing artifacts in the malware.
For example, in order to be able to report on the victim’s activities, Attor monitors active
processes to take screenshots of selected applications. Only certain applications are targeted –
those with speciﬁc substrings in the process name or window title.
Besides standard services such as popular web browsers, instant messaging applications and
email services, the list of targeted applications contains several Russian services, as detailed in
Table 1.

The list includes the two most popular social networks in Russia (Odnoklassniki, VKontakte) and
a VoIP service provided by a Russian telecom operator (Multifon). Our conclusion is that Attor is
speciﬁcally targeting Russian-speakers, which is further supported by the fact that most of the
targets are located in Russia, as seen in Figure 1. Other targets are located in Eastern Europe,
and they include diplomatic missions and governmental institutions.

Figure 1. Countries affected by Attor

In addition to its geographical and language targeting, Attor’s creators appear to be speciﬁcally
interested in users concerned about their privacy.
Attor is conﬁgured to capture screenshots of encryption/digital signature utilities, the VPN service
HMA, end‑to‑end encryption email services Hushmail and The Bat!, and the disk encryption utility
TrueCrypt.
The victim’s usage of TrueCrypt is further inspected in another part of Attor. It monitors hard disk
devices connected to the compromised computer, and searches for the presence of TrueCrypt. If
TrueCrypt is detected, its version is determined by sending IOCTLs to the TrueCrypt driver
(0x222004 (TC_IOCTL_GET_DRIVER_VERSION) and 0x72018
(TC_IOCTL_LEGACY_GET_DRIVER_VERSION)). As these are TrueCrypt-speciﬁc control

codes, not standard codes, the authors of the malware must actually understand the open-source
code of TrueCrypt installer. We have not seen this technique used before nor seen it documented
in other malware.

Figure 2. The Device monitor plugin sends non-standard, TrueCrypt-speciﬁc control codes to the TrueCrypt driver, in order to
determine the TrueCrypt version

Platform architecture
Attor consists of a dispatcher and loadable plugins, all of which are implemented as dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs). The ﬁrst step of a compromise comprises dropping all these components on disk
and loading the dispatcher DLL.

The dispatcher is the core of the whole platform – it serves as a management and
synchronization unit for the additional plugins. On each system start, it injects itself into almost all
running processes and loads all available plugins within each of these processes. As an
exception, Attor avoids injection into some system and security‑product‑related processes.
All plugins rely on the dispatcher for implementing basic functionalities. Rather than calling
Windows API functions directly, the plugins use a reference to a helper function (a function
dispatcher) implemented by the dispatcher DLL. A reference to the function dispatcher is passed
to the plugins when they are loaded. Because the plugins are injected in the same process as the
dispatcher itself, they share the same address space and are thus able to call this function
directly.
Calls to the function dispatcher take as their arguments the function type and its numerical
identiﬁer. This design makes it harder to analyze individual components of Attor without having
access to the dispatcher, as it translates the speciﬁed identiﬁer to a meaningful function that is
then executed.
Figure 3 illustrates a part of one plugin, calling the function dispatcher on several occasions. In
the disassembly on the right, we have replaced the numeric identiﬁers (that we recovered by
reverse-engineering the dispatcher) with descriptive names. Refer to our white paper for a full
analysis of the dispatcher’s interface.

Figure 3. Additional plugins use functions implemented in the main module, by calling the function dispatcher (dubbed
helperFnc here)

Furthermore, the dispatcher is the only component of the platform that has access to the
conﬁguration data. Attor’s plugins retrieve their conﬁguration data from the dispatcher via the
interface, as described above.

Plugins
Attor’s plugins are delivered to the compromised computer as DLLs, asymmetrically encrypted
with RSA. The plugins are only fully recovered in memory, using the public RSA key embedded in
the dispatcher. As a result, it is difﬁcult to obtain Attor’s plugins, and to decrypt them, without
access to the dispatcher.

We were able to recover eight of Attor’s plugins, some in multiple versions – we list them in Table
2. Assuming the numbering of plugins is continuous, and that actors behind Attor may use
different sets of plugins on a per‑victim basis, we suspect there are even more plugins that have
not yet been discovered.

Installer/watchdog

The plugins are responsible for persistence of the platform (Installer/watchdog plugin), for
collecting sensitive information (Device monitor, Screengrabber, Audio recorder, Key/clipboard
logger) and for network communication with the C&C server (File uploader, Command
dispatcher/SOCKS proxy, Tor client).
Attor has built-in mechanisms for adding new plugins, for updating itself, and for automatically
exﬁltrating collected data and log ﬁles. These mechanisms are illustrated in Figure 4.
In the following sections, we focus on plugins responsible for the two notable features that gave
Attor its name – GSM ﬁngerprinting via AT commands, and elaborate network communication
using Tor.

Figure 4. Attor’s architecture. Note that ID 0x06 represents a single plugin, but the functionality is split here into two parts for
clarity.

Network communication
Attor’s espionage plugins collect sensitive data (such as a list of documents present on the disk)
that are ultimately exﬁltrated to a remote server, but these plugins themselves do not
communicate over the network.
Only two of Attor’s components communicate with its C&C server: File uploader and Command
dispatcher.
Files collected by the “espionage plugins” (Device monitor, Screengrabber, Audio recorder, and
Key/clipboard logger) are uploaded to the C&C server automatically by the File uploader plugin.
These plugins use a dedicated Upload folder as a central folder to store collected data, and other
plugins use it to store log ﬁles.
The Command dispatcher plugin downloads commands and additional tools from the C&C server
and interprets them. Again, it uses dedicated folders to store its data – most prominently, freshly
downloaded plugins and platform updates, and encrypted log data containing status/results of the
executed commands.
Attor’s dispatcher monitors the shared folders, and loads any new plugins and updates pushed to
the compromised computer.
This means that neither Attor’s dispatcher, nor espionage plugins, ever communicate with the
C&C server – they only use local shared folders for storing data to be exﬁltrated and for reading
further instructions from the server.

Both File uploader, and Command dispatcher use the same infrastructure to reach the remote
server – the network communication itself is scattered across four different Attor components,
each implementing a different layer.
Attor uses Tor: Onion Service Protocol, with an onion address for the C&C server. In order to
communicate with the C&C server, any plugin must thus ﬁrst establish a connection with the Tor
client plugin (listening on the non‑default 127.0.0.1:8045) which is responsible for resolving the
onion domain, choosing a circuit and encrypting data in layers. The Tor client plugin is based on
the Tor client, and customized to the design of this malware (tor.exe with added interaction with
Attor’s dispatcher).
The Tor client plugin must communicate with the dispatcher, which implements the cryptographic
functions. Furthermore, it communicates with the SOCKS proxy plugin (listening on
127.0.0.1:5153) that relays communications between the Tor client and the remote server.
Both File uploader and Command dispatcher use FTP; ﬁles are uploaded to/downloaded from an
FTP server that is protected by credentials hardcoded in the conﬁguration:
C&C server: idayqh3zhj5j243t[.]onion
Username: do
Password: [Redacted]
The plugins log in to the FTP server and copy the collected data to, or download commands from,
a victim‑speciﬁc directory.
In total, the infrastructure for C&C communication spans four Attor components – the dispatcher
providing encryption functions, and three plugins implementing the FTP protocol, the Tor
functionality and the actual network communication, as illustrated in Figure 5. This mechanism
makes it impossible to analyze Attor’s network communication unless all pieces of the puzzle
have been collected.

Figure 5. Four Attor components cooperate to enable communication with the C&C server

It is important to note that Attor uses several additional tricks to hide its communications from the
user and security products:
First, the C&C server is a Tor service, aiming for anonymity and untraceability.
Second, all network-communication-related plugins are only activated if running within the
process of a web browser or an instant messaging application or other network applications (this
is determined by checking the process name against a hardcoded list). This trick hides the
exﬁltration-related network communication in a stream of legitimate communications made by that
application, and thus reduces the risk of raising any suspicion.

GSM ﬁngerprinting
The most curious plugin in Attor’s arsenal collects information about both connected
modem/phone devices and connected storage drives, and about ﬁles present on these drives. It
is responsible for collection of metadata, not the ﬁles themselves, so we consider it a plugin used
for device ﬁngerprinting, and hence likely used as a base for further data theft.
While Attor’s functionality of ﬁngerprinting storage drives is rather standard, its ﬁngerprinting of
GSM devices is unique.
Whenever a modem or a phone device is connected to a COM port, Device monitor uses AT
commands to communicate with the device, via the associated serial port.
AT commands, also known as Hayes command set, were originally developed in the 1980s to
command a modem to dial, hang up or change connection settings. The command set was
subsequently extended to support additional functionality, both standardized and vendor-speciﬁc.
In a recent paper, it was discovered that the commands are still in use in most modern
smartphones. Those researchers were able to bypass security mechanisms and communicate
with smartphones using AT commands through their USB interface. Thousands of commands
were recovered and tested, including those to send SMS messages, emulate on-screen touch
events, or leak sensitive information. That research illustrates that the old‑school AT commands
pose a serious risk when misused.
As for Attor’s plugin, however, we may only speculate why AT commands are employed. We have
detected a 64‑bit version of this plugin in 2019, and we can conﬁrm it is still a part of the newest
Attor version (that we ﬁrst saw in 2018). On the other hand, it seems unlikely it is targeting
modern smartphone devices. The plugin ignores devices connected via a USB port, and only
contacts those connected via a serial port (more precisely, devices whose friendly names match
“COM*”).
A more likely explanation of the plugin’s main motive is that it targets modems and older phones.
Alternatively, it may be used to communicate with some speciﬁc devices (used by the victim or
target organization) that are connected to the COM port or to the USB port using a USB-to-serial
adaptor. In this scenario, it is possible the attackers have learned about the victim’s use of these
devices using some other reconnaissance techniques.
In any case, the plugin retrieves the following information from the connected devices, using the
AT commands listed in Table 3:
Basic information about the mobile phone or GSM/GPRS modem: name of manufacturer,
model number, IMEI number and software version
Basic information about the subscriber: MSISDN and IMSI number

ing a GSM subscriber. This number has two parts. The initial part is comprised of six digits in
the North American standard and ﬁve digits in the European standard. It identiﬁes the GSM
network operator in a speciﬁc country with whom the subscriber holds an account. The sec‐
ond part is allocated by the network operator to identify the subscriber uniquely.

Note that many more (vendor-speciﬁc) AT commands exist that are not used by this plugin. It is
possible that the malware operators use the listed commands to ﬁngerprint the connected
devices, and then deploy another plugin with more speciﬁc commands to extract information from
the device.

Conclusion
Attor is an espionage platform, used for highly targeted attacks against high-proﬁle users in
Eastern Europe, and Russian-speaking, security-concerned users.
The malware, which has ﬂown under the radar since 2013, has a loadable-plugin architecture that
can be used to customize the functionality to speciﬁc victims. It includes an unusual plugin for
GSM ﬁngerprinting that utilizes the rarely used AT command set, and incorporates Tor with the
aim of anonymity and untraceability.
Our research provides a deep insight into the malware and suggests that it is well worth further
tracking of the operations of the group behind it.
