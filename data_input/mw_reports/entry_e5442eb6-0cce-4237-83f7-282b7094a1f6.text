BAE Systems 2019 Cyber Threat Predictions

Our predictions
for 2019
In businesses around the world, 2018 showed us that cyber security
vulnerabilities continue to grow and evolve. As more sophisticated
cyber criminals join the ranks, more malware is being launched than
ever before. It is estimated that approximately 300,000 new malware
samples are generated per day. The business impact and complexity
of managing cyber security is increasing dramatically, as is the need to
justify cyber security investments and provide reporting relevant to the
business to prove the value of those investments.
Advances in technology like artificial intelligence and machine
learning accelerate the pace of new, data-driven solutions, but this can
be a dual-edged sword as bad actors can leverage them into more
sophisticated attacks on companies that are just trying to stay abreast of
current threats. From malicious chatbots to the explosion of web apps
making their way into corporate networks, 2019 will likely continue to be
challenging for cyber security teams.
At BAE Systems, we have over 40 years of experience in securing the
assets of governments, nation states and businesses. Our vast reach
gives us a unique perspective on the state of cyber security. With that in
mind, Adrian Nish, BAE Systems Head of Threat Intelligence offers his
predictions for 2019.

Bank heists
move to
real time
Given the record number of cyber heists in
2018, it is likely bank networks will continue
to be in the crosshairs of financially
motivated threat groups in 2019. However,
there will be changes in how these
groups attempt to move money from
bank systems to their own hands. Many
attacks over recent years have focused on
international interbank payment systems.
These have a major disadvantage for
criminals though, in that there is a delay
of 24-48 hours before the funds are settled
and available to be moved. This time
window allows the authorities time to catch
up following an attack and freeze the funds.
In 2019 we anticipate attackers will shift
to targeting systems that allow realtime settlement of funds – meaning
that money can be moved through a
network of accounts more quickly and
ultimately laundered successfully. This will
present a challenge for the community
in terms of the speed of response and
international co-operation.

The death of
the password
How many times over the past year have you had to click a ‘Forgot
Password’ link? And was that more than the previous year? For all
but the geniuses among us, the challenge of remembering individual
passwords for dozens of websites and apps is becoming too much
to handle. Add to this the fact that more vendors are following ‘best
practice’ and forcing use of special characters, increased length, regular
password changes; and the task quickly becomes impossible.
Security engineers have long had it in for passwords, and leading tech
firms have begun to adopt smarter, more friction-free alternatives.
A ‘survival-of-the-fastest’ rule exists for online services, and those
presenting a login screen hurdle will find their usage declining as leaders
choose new authentication technologies. Could 2019 be the year that
turns the tide on the scourge of passwords?

Anti-AI
activists
attack
Advances in machine learning and
automation are set to bring continued
benefits to businesses and consumers
alike. However, this is not without costs
and risks. Displacement of workers will
lead to social issues; a proliferation of data
collection will create privacy and security
concerns; and there will be worries that
the robots are making too many decisions
or taking over (Hollywood has been
forewarning us of this for decades…).
In 2019 we may see the emergence
of activist groups concerned with the
potential for an AI revolution and the
negative impacts this may have. Such
groups could begin to deploy tactics
to counter robotic systems and AI. For
example, putting stickers on road signs
to trick sensors in autonomous vehicles
resulting in mistakes and potentially even
accidents.

Bitcoin crashes
The value of anything is only whatever someone else is willing to
pay for it. For Bitcoin in 2019 that may well be close to zero. The
Bitcoin bubble is bursting, and a 40% drop in recent months may be
foreshadowing even further falls to come next year. Although there is
still promise that crypto-currency could yield benefits for consumers, for
example in areas such as speed of transaction and global portability,
the recent volatility will scare off both investors and potential corporate
users. Without mainstream adoption, the hope of stabilisation will
diminish and those who’ve previously invested will look to sell while they
can. 2019 could be a year of reckoning for Bitcoin, but it need not spell
the end of crypto-currency generally.

Testing times
for regulations
The Panama Papers and subsequent revelations have resulted in a greater
requirement for regulated industries to Know Your Customer (KYC) and
establish Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO). 2019 will further put pressure on
the sector around KYC, but will also see extra constraints due to GDPR. UBO
requirements ask for more data to be analysed, but GDPR asks for proportionate
data to be analysed. The regulations are at odds with each other in regards to
financial crime prevention and we anticipate this will cause more challenges for
organisations required to comply with both. This will likely result in test cases to
establish how organisations interpret the conflicting needs and potentially even
changes in regulations as lessons are learned.

Summary
Clearly, 2019 will continue to have some significant cyber security
hurdles, with the shortage of cyber security professionals among them.
The amount of complexity in cyber security systems continues to make
staying ahead of hackers difficult and time consuming.
This is the opportune moment for businesses to revisit their cyber
security plans to make sure they have the right mix of technology to
detect cyber attacks and the right people to defend against them.
