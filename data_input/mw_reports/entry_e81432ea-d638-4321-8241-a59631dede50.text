Cyphort Labs has collected and analyzed a highly advanced piece of malware, which for all
intents and purposes seems to be a full blown cyber espionage tool of the kind a nation state
would be behind. This malware invades Windows desktop machines and aims at exfiltrating
almost anything of value: it steals data from instant messengers, softphones, browsers and
office applications.
The analyzed malware consists of two pieces: a dropper and an implant. The implant is able
to hook APIs of interest in dedicated remote processes to steal data on the fly.

The internal project name of the analyzed malware is ‘Babar64’, which rings a bell when
thinking back of documents leaked through Der Spiegel back in January
(http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35683.pdf). There, a slide deck originating from

Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) describes an alleged nation state
malware named Babar. The samples at hand fit well with what is described in the CSEC
document; and, as CSEC states they are suspected to originate from French intelligence.
As it is with binary attribution, these allegations are impossible to prove without the shadow
of a doubt. What we can say with certainty though is that Babar strikes the analyst with
sophistication not typically seen in common malware. Furthermore, the binaries come with
the same handwriting as the malware dubbed ‘Bunny’ which we have blogged about before
(http://www.cyphort.com/evilbunny-malware-instrumented-lua/). We assume the same author
is behind both families.
Note: I will be hosting a webinar on the topic of Evil Bunny malware next week. You can

A BABAR(ian) BINARY
A target machine is infected possibly through a drive-by or malicious e-mail attachments.
Babar is deployed through a malware dropper, which installs the malware.
Babar essentially is an implant, a malicious Windows DLL. Babar’s implant is a 32-bit DLL
written in C++, which upon start injects itself to running processes and invades desktop
applications by applying a global Windows hook. The original filename of the sample at hand
is ‘perf585.dll’. The implant is capable of logging keystrokes, capturing screen shots,
eavesdropping on installed softphones and spying on instant messengers in addition to a list
of simpler espionage tricks. Babar is a full blown espionage tool, built to excessively spy on
the activity on an infected machine’s user.
The DLL dropped by Babar is placed into the application data folder, along with a directory
named ‘MSI’ where the runtime data will be stored. Babar operates through multiple
instances, by injecting its DLL to a maximum of three desktop processes. This is achieved by
loading the Babar DLL to remote processes through a mapped memory object.

Apart from that, Babar comes with a userland rootkit component which applies global
Windows hooks to invade all processes on its desktop. This way Babar can install API hooks
for various APIs via Windows Detours technique to actively steal data from arbitrary
processes.
The spying activities are performed either through the Babar instance locally or through
processes invaded via hooking. Instance-local capabilities are basic spying on window
names or snooping on the clipboard data, while the global hooks manage to steal information
directly from Windows API calls.
A summary of the capabilities would be as follows:
Logging keystrokes
Taking screenshots
Capture of audio streams from softphone applications
Stealing of clipboard data
System and user default language, keyboard layout
Names of desktop windows
The keylogger module is based on Windows RAWINPUT. The malware creates an invisible
window, with no other purpose than to receive window messages. By processing the window
message queue it filters out input events and dispatches them to a raw input device object.
Said object is configured to grab keyboard events through GetRawInputData.

3/5

The interest of Babar’s process hooking module is focused on the following applications,
parted in the categories internet communication, file processing and media:
Internet communication
iexplore.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe,Safari.exe,msnmsgr.exe
File processing
exe, winword.exe, powerpnt.exe, visio.exe, acrord32.exe, notepad.exe,
wordpad.exe.txt
Media
skype.exe, msnmsgr.exe, oovoo.exe, nimbuzz.exe, googletalk.exe,
yahoomessenger.exe, x-lite.exe
The malicious implant can steal input coming from the keyboard, information on which files
are edited, it can intercept chat messages and record calls established by one of the listed
softphones. The stolen information is encrypted and dumped to a file on disk, which will be
located in the working directory under %APPDATA%\MSI.
COMMAND AND CONTROL SERVERS
The analyzed sample of Babar has two hard coded C&C server addresses which are
included in its configuration data:
http://www.horizons-tourisme.com/_vti_bin/_vti_msc/bb/index.php
http://www.gezelimmi.com/wp-includes/misc/bb/index.php
The domain horizons-tourisme.com is a legitimate website, operated by an Algerian travel
agency, located in Algiers, Algeria. The website is in French and still online today.
Gezelimmi.com is a Turkish domain, currently responding with an HTTP error message 403,
access not permitted. Both domains appear to be of legitimate use, but compromised and
abused to host Babar’s server side infrastructure.
