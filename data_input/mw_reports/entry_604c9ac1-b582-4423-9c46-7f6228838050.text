Midas Ransomware: Tracing the Evolution of Thanos Ransomware Variants
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/midas-ransomware-tracing-evolution-thanos-ransomware-variants

Key Takeaways: An in-depth analysis of Midas and trends across other Thanos ransomware variants reveals how
ransomware groups shifted tactics in 2021 to:
lower sunk costs by using RaaS builders to reduce development time
increase payouts with double extortion tactics by using their own data leak sites
extend the length and effectiveness of campaigns to get the highest investment returns by updating
payloads and/or rebranding their own ransomware group
Advertised on the darkweb for Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), Thanos ransomware was first identified in February
2020. Written in C# language running on the .net framework, this serious offender reboots systems in safeboot mode to
bypass antivirus detection and includes a builder that enables threat actors to create new variants by customizing
samples. Source code of Thanos builder also leaked and there are lots of different variants that have been seen based
on that. Here we discuss the four 2021 variants shown in Figure 1 below that used double extortion tactics.

Figure 1:Timeline of Thanos derived ransomware variations
Beginning in February 2021, the Prometheus ransomware variant emerged as one of the new Thanos built variants of
the year. It encrypts files and appends “.[{ID}],.PROM[[email protected]{.}ch] , {ID}[[email protected]{.}com] “ extension
and drop “RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt, RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta” ransom note. The Prometheus group which
operates the variant has claimed to be part of the notorious REvil ransomware group responsible for the Kaseya supply
chain attack, however experts doubt the claim as a solid connection between the two has never been established. This
variant is known for using double extortion techniques to make organizations pay that include threatening to leak
valuable data on their leak site. A quick check reveals that the leak site is currently down, but the threat still holds
potential weight
In July 2021, another Thanos derived ransomware called Haron was discovered. It encrypts files and appends “.
{Targeted Company name}” extension and drops “RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta,RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt” ransom
note. Haron ransomware group also have their own data leak site used for double extortion. This variant has striking
similarities with Avaddon ransomware based on examination of the ransom note and data leak site information.
September 2021, the Thanos builder was used again to develop the Spook ransomware variant. It encrypts files and
appends “.{ID}” extension and drops “RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta,RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt” ransom note. Similar
to the other variants, Spook ransomware also uses double extortion techniques with their own data leak site as shown in
the screenshot below.
Rounding out the year in October 2021, another Thanos ransomware family emerged with the Midas variant that
appends “.{Targeted Company name}” extension and drops “RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta and
RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt” ransom note. In January 2022, ThreatLabz investigated a report of Midas ransomware
being slowly deployed over a 2-month period and the attacker was observed using different powershell scripts, remote
access tools and an open source windows utility.
Like the others, Midas features its own data leak site for double extortion. Interestingly, the site contains leaked victim
data from a Haron ransomware attack, suggesting to researchers that Midas is potentially linked to the Haron
ransomware operators.

Identifying Thanos as the Source for the Prometheus, Haron, Spook, and Midas
ransomware variants
Tracing the evolution of Thanos based ransomware variants back to the source provides threat researchers with an
inside look at how ransomware gangs operate and evolve over time. To establish a connection between each variant,
the ThreatLabz team looked for the use of common signatures and indicators that would point back to the Thanos
ransomware builder. After determining that each variant was derived using the builder, the team set about analyzing the
similarities and differences in the shifting techniques adversaries employ to make new variants of a common origin
ransomware more effective. These observations help us to gain insights into the cooperation happening between
adversary groups and better understand the development lifecycle and alternating impacts of ransomware through its
variants.
The analysis that follows walks you through identifying Thanos variants through an examination of common signatures
found in the ransom note key identifiers and the consistent use of a common file marker “GotAllDone”. Followed by an
in-depth analysis of the latest Midas variant.
Identifying Thanos Variants
All four of the 2021 Thanos based ransomware variants contain a key identifier with common signatures for the Thanos
builder found in the ransom notes as shown in Figure 3 below.

Figure 3: Screenshots of ransom notes showing the common signature ‘Key Identifier’ for 2021 Thanos ransomware
variants: Prometheus, Haron, Spook and Midas.
Another similarity is that after encryption they append base 64 encoded key after encrypting data of every file.
Prometheus, Haron, Spook, and Midasall contain the same FileMarker that is “GotAllDone” appended at the end of each
encrypted file. Below screenshot displays the FileMarker info and Base64 encoded key appended after the data
encrypted by Midas ransomware.

Midas Ransomware
The Midas data leak site currently displays data from 29 victim companies including data from several victims previously
seen on the Haron data leak site which is now inactive.

Technical analysis
Midas ransomware is written in C# and obfuscated using smartassembly. Once executed this variant starts terminating
processes using taskkill.exe. It terminates processes that inhibit encryption processes and processes related to security
software, database related programs so it can encrypt more files. Below is a list of the common processes typically
terminated by Thanos based ransomware.
Most commonly terminated processes:

It also deletes the process, schedule task and registry related to the Raccine tool. It is a ransomware prevention tool that
protects the system from ransomware processes to delete shadow copy.
Prometheus, Haron, Spook and Midas have been seen terminating Raccine related artifacts.

The Midas variant is designed to stop service related to security products, database software, backups and email
exchanges.

Further, it changes the configuration of specific services as shown below.

Figure 8: Screenshot of service configuration changes.
It deletes shadow copy using powershell command so the system is unable to recover data.
Command : "powershell.exe" & Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object { $_Delete(); }

File Encryption
Midas ransomware searches through each drive and directory and encrypts the files. It creates a random key and
encrypts a file using Salsa20 algorithm. Then the Salsa20 key is encrypted by the RSA public key as shown in the
screenshot below. The encryption key is encoded in base64 and appended to each impacted file. It also added
FileMarker “GotAllDone” at the end of each encrypted file. The encrypted key is also saved in the Registry under
“HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\KEYID\myKeyID”. After encryption, it drops the “reload1.lnk” file to open a
ransom note at every restart.
Path: "C:\\Users\\{Username}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start
Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\reload1.lnk".

It encrypts the file contained below extensions:

After encryption it appends “.{Targeted Company name}” extension and drops “RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta and
RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt” ransom note. Below is the screenshot of the ransom note. RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta
doesn’t contain Key ID but RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt contains key ID.
