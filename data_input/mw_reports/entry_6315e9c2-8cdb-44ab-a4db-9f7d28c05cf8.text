A technologist and maintainer of a popular piece of open source software has deliberately
sabotaged their own code to wipe data on computers that used the program in Russia and
Belarus, and has faced a massive backlash for doing so, according to messages posted on
coding repository Github.

The news signals the potential downsides of digital hacktivism, with the move likely
impacting ordinary people that were using the code.
RIAEvangelist is the maintainer of the software called “node-ipc,” a networking tool that’s
sometimes downloaded over a million times a week. RIAEvangelist released two modules
called “peacenotwar” and “oneday-test” recently, Bleeping Computer reported on Thursday.
Peacenotwar, which RIAEvangelist has described as “protestware,” was then included as a
dependency in node-ipc’s code, meaning some versions of node-ipc may come bundled with
peacenotwar.

“This code serves as a non-destructive example of why controlling your node modules is
important. It also serves as a non-violent protest against Russia's aggression that threatens
the world right now. This module will add a message of peace on your users' desktops, and it
will only do it if it does not already exist just to be polite,” RIAEvangelist wrote in the
description for the peacenotwar code. RIAEvangelist’s description also explained how other
people could add the module to their code in order to take part in the digital protest.
On the GitHub page for peacenotwar, RIAEvangelist included a link to a YouTube video and
lyrics from the peace song “One Day” by Mattisyahu, the Jewish American reggae musical
artist.
But then some versions of “node-ipc,” the much more popular piece of software that
RIAEvangelist maintains, started overwriting files on computers based in Russia and Belarus
with a heart emoji, according to a post on GitHub.

RIAEvangelist told Motherboard in an email that “There was no actual code to wipe
computers. It only puts a file on the desktop.” He then pointed to a Twitter account he said
belonged to him and which had now been targeted by hackers.
His LinkedIn profile is no longer available. Six hours ago, RIAEvangelist updated the nodeipc page to read “Thanks for all the free pizza, and thanks to all the police that showed up to
SWAT me. They were really nice fellas.”
The GitHub page for node-pic is now full of reactions to RIAEvangelist’s apparent sabotage.
“You’re a stain on the FOSS [free and open source software] community,” reads one. “You
just destroyed your work, career and probably your online life,” another adds. Others include
links to RIAEvangelist’s social media accounts.
