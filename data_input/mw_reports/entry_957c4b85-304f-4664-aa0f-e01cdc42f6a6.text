Hardly a day passes without news of another company, hospital, school district or municipal
government temporarily brought to a halt by ransomware. In fact, ransomware attacks have
become so commonplace that they make the news far less than they used to.
Yet while ransomware may no longer captivate the public’s attention, security professionals
justifiably continue to obsess over it. Ransomware remains the most profitable method for
cybercriminals to monetize their unauthorized access into business networks, with increasing
ransom demands often ranging from $1 million to $10 million USD. For this reason alone, all
organizations are potential targets for ransomware campaigns that almost always have a
costly business impact, including disruption to operations and extortion that involves
sensitive data theft.
Ransomware preparedness has become imperative for all organizations, so much so that
even chief executives and boards of directors are recognizing it as part of their responsibility
to promote good governance. But it is a cat-and-mouse game — as defenses improve,
ransomware actors continue to innovate to find new methods to compromise and extort their
victims.

The CrowdStrike® Services team routinely assists organizations both in preparing for and
responding to ransomware attacks. The following are some of the practices we recommend
most frequently.

Improve Resiliency of Internet-facing Applications
CrowdStrike has observed eCrime threat actors exploiting single-factor authentication and
unpatched internet-facing applications. BOSS SPIDER, one of the initial big game hunting
(BGH) ransomware threat actors, routinely targeted systems with Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) accessible from the internet. Less sophisticated threat actors operating ransomware
variants such as Dharma, Phobos and GlobeImposter frequently gain access through RDP
brute-force attacks.
CrowdStrike recommends against RDP being exposed directly to the internet. Organizations
currently leveraging the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform can quickly and effectively identify
systems being actively brute-forced via RDP by using the following query in the Falcon Event
Activity Monitor:
event_simpleName=UserLogonFailed2 | iplocation RemoteAddressIP4 | stats
values(ClientComputerName) AS ClientComputerNames dc(UserName) values(LogonDomain) AS
LogonDomains dc(RemoteAddressIP4) values(LogonType_decimal) dc(Country) count by
event_simpleName ComputerName | sort -"dc(Country)"

In a separate but similar campaign in 2020, CrowdStrike observed CIRCUS SPIDER, the
group behind the development of Netwalker ransomware, and TWISTED SPIDER, the group
behind the development of Maze ransomware, exploit CVEs (common vulnerabilities and
exposures) associated with Pulse VPN to gain access into victim organizations. For this
reason, CrowdStrike recommends utilizing a VPN with multifactor authentication, and
ensuring that any CVEs associated with the VPN platform(s) and the underlying
authentication application are prioritized for patching. This principle should extend to all
remote methods including, but not limited to Azure Active Directory (AD) and Citrix Gateway.
The latter, being used by threat actors such as TRAVELING SPIDER — the criminal
developer of Nemty ransomware — has been observed by CrowdStrike to take advantage of
single-factor authentication to gain access to victim organizations through Citrix Gateway
and send extortion-related emails using the victim’s own Microsoft Office 365 instance.

Implement and Enhance Email Security
Gaining an initial foothold into a victim organization through a phishing email is the most
common tactic for BGH ransomware groups. Typically, these phishing emails contain a
malicious link or URL that delivers a payload to the recipient’s workstation.
CrowdStrike recommends implementing an email security solution that conducts URL
filtering and also attachment sandboxing. To streamline these efforts, an automated
response capability can be used to allow for retroactive quarantining of delivered emails
2/7

before the user interacts with them. In addition, organizations may want to restrict users from
receiving password-protected zip files, executables, javascripts or Windows installer package
files unless there is a legitimate business need. Adding an “[External]” tag to emails
originating from outside of the organization and a warning message on top of the email’s
body can help remind users to use discretion when handling such emails.
Users should also have a documented process to report any emails they are unsure of along
the way. In addition, if business permits, organizations should consider restricting users’
access to personal email accounts.
As always, organizations should also implement a robust security awareness program that
includes routine user training, reminders and “phish-me” campaigns. Creating your own
“phish-me” campaign is one of the best and safest ways for your employees to learn to not
be fooled by phishing emails. The old adage applies: “Fool me once, shame on you — fool
me twice, shame on me.” CrowdStrike employs this best practice internally.

Harden Endpoints
Throughout an attack lifecycle that ultimately culminates in a ransomware deployment, threat
actors will often leverage a number of endpoint exploitation techniques. These exploitation
techniques vary from exploiting poor AD configurations to leveraging publicly available
exploits against unpatched systems or applications.
A proper endpoint hardening strategy will ensure that threat actors have to defeat multiple
defensive layers before achieving success in the attack. Each layer of defense the threat
actor encounters provides an opportunity for defensive teams to detect and ultimately
contain the activity before it results in ransomware deployment.
The list below includes some key system-hardening actions for defenders to implement. It is
important to note this is not an exhaustive list, and system hardening should be an iterative
process.
Ensure full coverage across all endpoints on your network for endpoint security
products, and for the endpoint detection and protection (EDR) platform. Each endpoint
security platform should have strict anti-tampering protections and alerting in place if
and when a sensor goes offline or gets uninstalled.
Develop a vulnerability and patch management program. Doing so will ensure that
all endpoint applications and operating systems are kept up-to-date. Ransomware
actors leverage endpoint vulnerabilities for many purposes, including but not limited to
privilege escalation and lateral movement. Existing Falcon customers can leverage
CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight™ vulnerability management for a near real-time way to
understand exposure to a particular vulnerability across the environment, without the
need to deploy additional agents and security tools.

3/7

Follow Active Directory security best practices. Based on some of the most
common AD downfalls observed by CrowdStrike Services during ransomware
engagements, we recommend these steps:
Avoid easy-to-guess passwords with weak authentication methods.
Avoid having regular domain users with local administrator privileges, and local
administrator accounts with the same passwords across the entire enterprise or
large portions of the enterprise.
Limit workstation-to-workstation communication. While this can be achieved using
group policy objects (GPOs), it can be also achieved through a number of microsegmentation software options.
Avoid sharing privileged credentials. Poor security practices include shared
administrative accounts and using administrator accounts for personal or day-today business activity that does not require administrator privileges.
Note that the first two points above can be accomplished using AD with little to no
additional costs. At an additional cost, a privileged access management (PAM)
solution can provide a much more scalable and robust solution to the same
problem and is discussed more later in this blog post.
With the recent acquisition of Preempt, CrowdStrike is continuously adding capabilities to its
Zero Trust framework. The “Implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM)” section of
this blog explains how Falcon Zero Trust can help you further harden your endpoints and
improve your IAM program.

Ransomware-proof Data with Offline Backups
In recent years, and since the emergence of ransomware as a top method of monetizing
attacks, the developers behind malicious code have become very effective at ensuring
victims and security researchers cannot decrypt affected data without paying the ransom for
the decryption key. Further, when developing a ransomware-proof backup infrastructure, the
most important idea to consider is that threat actors have targeted online backups before
deploying ransomware to the environment.
For these reasons, the only sure way of salvaging data during a ransomware attack is
through ransomware-proof backups. For example, maintaining offline backups of your data
allows for a quicker recovery in emergencies. The following points should be considered
when developing a ransomware-proof offline backup infrastructure:
Offline backups, as well as the indexes (describing which volumes contain which data)
should be completely separate from the rest of the infrastructure.
Access to such networks should be controlled via strict access control lists (ACLs), and
all authentications should be performed using multifactor authentication (MFA).

4/7

Administrators with access to both offline and online infrastructures should avoid
reusing account passwords and use a jump box when accessing the offline backup
infrastructure.
Cloud storage services, with strict ACLs and rules, can also serve as offline backup
infrastructure.
Emergency situations such as a ransomware attack should be the only time the offline
infrastructure is allowed a connection to the live network.

Restrict Access to Virtualization Management Infrastructure
As mentioned earlier, threat actors engaged in big game hunting ransomware campaigns are
continuously innovating to increase the effectiveness of their attacks. The most recent such
development includes the ability to attack virtualized infrastructure directly. This approach
allows for targeting of hypervisors that deploy and store virtual machines (VMDK). As a
result, the endpoint security products installed on the virtualized machines are blind to
malicious actions taken on the hypervisor.
To further understand how this attack would unfold, we will use some of VMware’s naming
convention as it is the most common virtualizing product found in today’s enterprise
environments.
Many ESXi systems (VMware hypervisors) do not have Secure Shell (SSH) protocol enabled
by default and are usually managed via vCenter. If SSH is disabled, previously stolen
administrative credentials are used to enable SSH on all ESXi systems. Once that is
complete, a valid account is used to SSH into each ESXi system being targeted. Before the
threat actor deploys the Linux-based ransomware, VMDKs hosted on the ESXi are stopped
to allow the ransomware binary to access the files for encryption purposes. Systems
impacted by the ransomware through this deployment method will be completely offline and
inaccessible to the users.
Recently, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed this method being used by CARBON
SPIDER and SPRITE SPIDER, and CrowdStrike expects this trend to continue to be used
and adopted by eCrime operators. As adoption of this tactic becomes wider, the following
items can help organizations strengthen their virtualized environments.
Restrict access to ESXi hosts to a small number of systems, and ensure these systems
are fully patched and have proper endpoint monitoring in place.
ESXi systems are commonly managed via LDAP-binded Active Directory accounts,
which are often privileged accounts targeted by the threat actor earlier in the
compromise. Removing or limiting such bindings could minimize the chance of an
already-compromised administrative account being used to target the ESXi systems
with ransomware.
Ensure SSH access is disabled, or ensure that it is secured by MFA.

5/7

Ensure passwords are unique to each ESXi host as well as to the web client and are
strong/complex, using a combination of letters, special characters and numbers. Avoid
using dictionary words and “1337” speak.
Enable Normal Lockdown Mode to further restrict access. See reference here.

Implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM) Program
Organizations can improve their security posture by implementing a robust IAM program that
maintains an activity trail for all privileged and service accounts, with immediate identification
for anomalous traffic or abnormal resource requests.
To help organizations implement an IAM program, CrowdStrike offers two Identity Protection
modules: Falcon Zero Trust and Falcon Identity Threat Detection. Deploying these modules
to an existing Falcon instance will create real-time layers of threat prevention of identitybased attacks and anomalies targeting an organization. The adaptive capabilities of this
platform allow enterprises to automate responses with the right type of enforcement or
notification based on identity, behavior and risk. For example, service accounts attempting to
connect via RDP, or RDP connecting to an unusual destination, could be challenged via
multifactor authentication or blocked by Falcon Zero Trust in real time.
In addition, nearly all BGH ransomware groups will utilize off-the-shelf credential dumping
tools such as Mimikatz or SPRITE SPIDER’s PyXie and LaZagne modules to steal
credentials and expand their foothold within the environment. The output of the tools are then
used by the attackers to move laterally within a network using techniques such as Pass-theHash, Pass-the-Ticket, Kerberoasting and others.
An IAM platform such as Falcon Identity Protection can detect credential exploitation as well
as the use of risky protocols and abnormal behavior within the AD environment. These
detections will identify devices and accounts that have been compromised and, based on the
configured policy, decide if such accounts need to be challenged via MFA/2FA or blocked to
halt the progress of the attack. This will significantly cripple BGH ransomware groups from
being able to act on their objectives.

Develop and Pressure-test an Incident Response Plan
Organizations sometimes become aware of threat actor activity within their environment, but
they lack the visibility to address the problem or the right intelligence to understand the
nature of the threat. Recognizing the threat and responding quickly and effectively can be the
difference between a major incident and a near miss.
Incident response plans and playbooks help facilitate that speedy decision making. Plans
should cover all parts of the response effort, across the organization. For the security team,
they should provide aids to decision-making so that front-line responders don’t overlook

6/7

important details while triaging alerts. They should also outline the extent of the security
team’s authority to take decisive actions — such as shutting down business-essential
services — if a ransomware attack appears imminent.
For the crisis management team, plans should identify who will be involved and what their
roles and responsibilities are. It should also tee up important decisions, like when to activate
an incident response retainer, whether to notify insurance carriers, when and how to involve
in-house or outside counsel, and how to discuss ransom demands with executives.
Consider conducting regular tabletop exercises to test the incident response plan and
processes. Some organizations may benefit from simulated exercises such as “purple team”
engagements, where red teamers mimic ransomware operators’ actions on objectives,
including data exfiltration and ultimately ransomware deployment. CrowdStrike also
recommends regular exercising of your incident response plan, both planned and unplanned,
such as utilizing a red team to conduct a mock attack operation.
Organizations should never be surprised or caught flat-footed by an attack — it should be
expected and planned for.

Take Steps Now
Any organization can fall victim to costly ransomware campaigns with ransom demands in
the seven digits, but much can be done to stop threat actors before they get a chance to
detonate a widespread ransomware attack. Locking down common initial entry vectors,
implementing multifactor authentication, and hardening of both endpoint and Active Directory
infrastructure can pay dividends by improving an organization’s resiliency to ransomware
threat actors.
While it’s not possible to prevent all network intrusions, creating enough obstacles through
principles of security-in-depth, and the recommended “1-10-60” benchmark time (one minute
to detect an incident, 10 minutes to investigate and one hour to remediate), can ensure that
threat actors are halted before achieving their objectives of data theft and ransomware
deployment.
