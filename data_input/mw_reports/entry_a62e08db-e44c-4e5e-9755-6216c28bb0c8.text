Introduction
The group behind Emotet malware is getting smarter and smarter in the way the deliver such a
Malware. While the infection schema looks alike from years; the way the group tries to infect
victims improves from day to day.
Today I’d like to share a quick analysis resulted by a very interesting email which claimed to
deliver a SOC “weekly report” on the victim email. First of all the attacker knew the target
organization was protected by a SOC (Security Operation Center) so she sent a well crafted
email claiming to deliver a Microsoft document wrapping out the weekly SOC report as a normal
activity in order to induce the victim to open-it.
SOC report 10 12 2019.doc (
6125489453c1824da3e28a54708e7c77875e500dd82a59c96c1d1e5ee88dcad7 ) is the delivered

ﬁle sent on Oct 11, 2019, 11:06:09 PM from grecia@ambientehomedecor.com . I believe that
ambientehomedecor.com is not a malicious domain but mostly a new compromised one.

Following the original eMail headers from grecia@ambientehomedecor.com to victim’s email
box it is possible to ﬁgure-out the attacker used a SMPT client who left trace about the original
sender IP address which happens to be: 81.48.36.59 . According to IPLocation that address is
related to a very nice town in northern France: Thury-Harcourt, France.

Thury-Harcourt, France. Sender IP

The attached document is a well obfuscated Microsoft Word document which asks to enable
macros in order to view its content. The autoopen function begins a complex obfuscated chain
which tries to deter analyst by introducing junk code, junk variable assignments and fake
apparent real comments. The following image proves the adopted obfuscation technique. The
function c878cxx90590 is the “Real Code” by meaning is not part of junk code but actually is
the function who really performs malicious actions. As you might see being in the middle of
hundreds similar lines of code it gets hard to spot.

Obfuscated Macro

The obfuscated macro creates on-memory objects and runs them without passing through
temporary ﬁles. The following image shows the auto-run created object before the Drop’n
Execute. The analysed variable in the following image is the c0639047895c6 which, in that
speciﬁc run, holds the Win32_ProcessStartup created Object for fulﬁll persistence on the victim
machine.

Object Building

Once the dropper assured the persistence and to run during the start-up, it carves from itself the
following powershell script. The script runs an encoded string hiding the dropping ULRs. The
base64 decoded string shows a romantic foreach statement looping through a list of
compromised websites hosting the real payload :
de6a8b8612b5236a18eea1a6a8f53e117d046cf2ad95e079a6715af68f8d2216 (VT 6/69). It
ﬁnally saves the dropped ﬁle in a userproﬁle location as placed in the variable xc0x57b38b2x7 ,
before running it. The following image shows the powershell script before and after the encoding
by giving a quick description on it.

According to VT, the ﬁnal run looks like Emotet, a banking trojan who steals credentials, cookies
and eCoin wallets. Emotet is also able to access to saved credentials of the major browser like
Chromium, Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi to exﬁltrate cookies, and to send back to command and control
found victim information. But let’s try to quickly check it.

The dropped ﬁle (VT 12/69), grabbed from the dropping URLs inside the previous powershell
script, is an executable packed by internal functions which uses several techniques to avoid static
and dynamic analysis. For example it deletes the original ﬁle once executed, it resolves an
unusual very high number of APIs and it dynamically resolves functions avoiding static analysis.

Emotet Depacked

During the running phase the analyzed sample records many information on the hosting machine,
it asks for local public IP address by querying an external resource:
http[://185[.42[.221[.78:443/whoami.php and ﬁnally it pushes out those information to external
Command and Control (please refer to IoC section for the complete C2 list).

Recorded Information

The sample starts a local service called khmerdefine and assures its persistence by adding
that ﬁle in c:\Windows\SysWOW64 and setting up a system service in autorun. AV and plenty
static trafﬁc signatures conﬁrm we are facing a new encrypted version of Emotet trojan.

Conclusion
Emotet gang is getting smarter and smarter in delivery artifacts. That time they addressed
companies having an external Security Operation Center (SOC) pretending to simulate an
external SOC operator who sends periodic reports to the company. The delivery content was a
Microsoft word document within heavily obfuscated Macros who eventually drops and executes
Emotet Malware. The following image represent the compiled MITRE ATT&CK matrix in order to
qualify stages and to describe the overall behavior.
