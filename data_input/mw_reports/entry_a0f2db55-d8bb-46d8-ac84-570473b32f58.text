Threat Research
By Xiaopeng Zhang | August 05, 2017
Over the past few days, FortiGuard Labs captured a number of JS (JavaScript) scripts.
Based on my analysis, they were being used to spread the new GlobeImposter ransomware
variants. I picked one of them and did a quick analysis. The version of the variant I reviewed
is “726”.
Figure 1 shows part of the JS file list that we captured. As you can see, the files with name
that start with “IMG_” and “NIC” are all GlobeImposter downloaders.

Download and Execution
When the JS “IMG_8798.js” is executed, it downloads GlobeImposter from
“hxxp://wendybull.com.au/87wefhi??JWbXSIl=JWbXSIl” and runs it. In my test environment,
the downloaded file name is 87wefhi.txt.exe. Next we’ll look at how it works on a victim’s
machine.
When GlobeImposter is launched, it dynamically extracts code into a heap space. It then
creates its child process with the flag “CREATE_SUSPENDED”. It creates a suspended
process, and later the code of the child process will be replaced with previously extracted
code. This extracted code will be executed when the child process resumes its execution.
This behavior is the main part of GlobeImposter’s functionality.
The screenshot in Figure 2 shows the process tree when GlobeImposter is executed.

Figure 2. The Process Tree
The initial process resumes the execution of its child process by calling “ResumeThread”,
and then exits. All the analysis below is about that child process.
The Child Process
First, it calls the API function SetThreadExecutionState and passes 0x80000041H to it. With
the parameter 0x80000041H, the Windows system will never sleep while the ransomware is
encrypting the files. The function is called again with 0x80000000 after its work is done.
To prevent it from being analyzed easily, most strings and part of its APIs are encrypted.
They are decrypted dynamically when running. Afterwards, it decrypts the exclusion folder
and file extension names. In this version, it sets two exclusion lists. While the ransomware
goes through all the folders and files on the victim’s machine, it skips those files in the folders
whose names are in an exclusion folder list and those files whose extension names are in an
exclusion extension list. (In this version, it does do the extension name checking, it ignores
the checking result though. Maybe it’s a bug).
Below are the exclusion lists:
Folder exclusion list: (44 in total)
Windows, Microsoft, Microsoft Help, Windows App Certification Kit, Windows Defender,
ESET, COMODO, Windows NT, Windows Kits, Windows Mail, Windows Media Player,
Windows Multimedia Platform, Windows Phone Kits, Windows Phone Silverlight Kits,
Windows Photo Viewer, Windows Portable Devices, Windows Sidebar, WindowsPowerShell,
Temp, NVIDIA Corporation, Microsoft.NET, Internet Explorer, Kaspersky Lab, McAfee, Avira,
spytech software, sysconfig, Avast, Dr.Web, Symantec, Symantec_Client_Security, system
volume information, AVG, Microsoft Shared, Common Files, Outlook Express, Movie Maker,
Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, YandexBrowser, ntldr, Wsus, ProgramData.

Relocation and Startup Group
Afterwards, it copies itself into “%AllUserProfile%\Public\” and adds the new file in the startup
group in the victim’s Windows registry. This allows it to be executed automatically whenever
the system starts. Figure 3 shows that GlobeImposter has been added
(….RunOnce\CerificatesCheck) into the startup group in the Windows registry.

Preparatory Work
To prevent the victim from restoring encrypted files from the Shadow Volume copies, it calls
“vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet” in an executable batch file to delete all shadows.
In that batch file it also cleans up Remote Desktop information saved in the system registry
as well as the file %UserProfile%\Documents\Default.rdp. The batch file is called again after
the file encryption work is done.
Figure 4 shows the content of the batch file.

Next, it initializes encryption related keys, data, etc. for encrypting files 2048-bit RSA. Part of
the key related data is saved in a newly created file “%AllUserProfile%\Public\{hex
numbers}”. The name of {hex numbers} is made from the hardware information of victim’s
machine.
Before Encrypting Files
Killing some running processes and generating an html file are the last two steps before its
starts encrypting files.
It calls taskkill.exe to kill running processes whose names include "sql", "outlook", "ssms",
"postgre", "1c", "excel" and "word". Killing these processes might cause them to release the
files they are using, which could result in this ransomware encrypting more files.
Figure 5 shows the pseudo code used to do this.

Figure 5. Kill Matched Processes
An HTML file (RECOVER-FILES-726.html) is then generated and dropped in the folder
where the files are encrypted. Opening the HTML file informs the victim that the system’s
files have been encrypted and provides instructions on how to pay to get them back. The
HTML file consists of the decrypted resources of this exe as well as a “personal ID”.
This “personal ID” is sent to the server when you see the payment page. That ID allows the
attacker to identify you and to generate the decryption key. Figure 6 is the screenshot of this
HTML file content.

Encryption Process
When GlobeImposter starts encrypting, it first scans files in all of the partitions on the victim’s
machine. It then encrypts almost every file as long as its folder name is not in the folder
exclusion list as mentioned before. It reads the file and then encrypts the file content using
the RSA algorithm and then overwrites the original content with encrypted content. The
“personal ID” is also appended after encrypted content has been added to the file.
Figure 7 shows the content of an encrypted file.

It then appends “..726” to every encrypted file name to identify that the file has been
encrypted.
The screenshot in Figure 8, below, shows that it is about to rename an encrypted file by
calling API MoveFileExW.

installation folder.

Solution
Through this analysis, we know how GlobeImposter is downloaded onto a victim’s machine,
and how it works to encrypt the files on victim’s machine. We also observed that many new
JS samples are spreading this ransomware. Since it uses an RSA 2048-bit key to encrypt
files, it’s very hard to decrypt them without the decryption key.
The URL in the JS file used to download the GlobeImposter has been rated as a
“Malicious Website” by the FortiGuard Webfilter service.
The JS file is detected as JS/GlobeImposter.A!tr by the FortiGuard Antivirus service.
The downloaded GlobeImposter is detected as W32/GlobeImposter.A!trby the
FortiGuard Antivirus service.
