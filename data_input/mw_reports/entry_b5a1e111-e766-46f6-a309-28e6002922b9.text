The Belarusian Cyber Partisans have shared documents related to another hack, and explained that
Curated Intel member, SttyK, would “understand some of the methods used.”

On Monday 24 January 2022, a Belarusian hacktivist group going by the name Belarusian Cyber-Partisans
claimed responsibility for a limited attack against the national railway company. A primary objective of the
attack, they claimed, was aimed at hindering Russian troop movements inside Belarus.

In public media reports, it has been stated that the rail service’s website issued a warning to passengers
that some e-ticket systems were unavailable (source: rw[.]by), seemingly confirming the Cyber-Partisans’
claims that they targeted network assets in order to disrupt operations. The Belarusian government has not
commented on the incident.

On Tuesday 24 January, Curated Intelligence member @SttyK obtained documents from Cyber-Partisans,
which the group claimed would help SttyK “understand some of the methods used” during the attack. Initially
SttyK reached out to the group seeking access to the malware used in the attack, which would have then
been studied. However, the group declined to share the code, but noted they would “gladly do that once the
authoritarian regime in Belarus is gone.”

Known Information:
Based on public reporting and previous interviews, the Belarusian Cyber-Partisans are "a group of 15 self
taught hacktivists who claim to have assistance and support from disaffected Belarusian security forces"
(source: CyberScoop). The group has been closely associated with a series of government website
defacement operations. Last August, the group spoke to Patrick Howell O’Neill at Technology Review, in a
rather informative interview, should anyone want some additional background.

As mentioned, SttyK reached out to the group in order to obtain malware samples for study. Instead, what
the group responded with were a series of documents. These documents represent a report based on an
investigation into an attack on 14 March 2021, which concluded on 8 April of the same year.

Editor Note: One of the first questions asked internally by Curated Intelligence members was “why?”. Why
are they sharing such details, and what do they have to gain by exposing a previously released incident
report? There are a number of answers to that question, but the key answer is exposure. As is the case with
articles in major publications, blogs such as this one give hacktivists attention to their cause. So then the
question becomes, is the information they shared with us of importance to the public (yes, it is). Thus giving
them attention is worth the trade-off in our opinions, and serves our goal of informing the public.

The Stolen Incident Response Report:
The report was first mentioned in a YouTube video on the Cyber-Partisans’ own YouTube Channel in
November 2021 (see here)
The investigation and report began on 25 March 2021 and was done by VirusBlokAda (the antivirus
firm that also first discovered Stuxnet)
The incident report costed 2530.00 BYN (worth an estimated $1,000 USD)
In the report, the initial date of compromise was discovered to be 14 March 2021
According to the report, the victim was the Academy of Public Administration under the President of
the Republic of Belarus

Considering this was a full incident response investigation that cost less than $1,000 it is unsurprising that
the findings are unclear. The attack chain was not fully explained, but we have tried to piece it together as
best we can with the help of a Curated Intelligence member, @0xDISREL, who can read and write Russian.
We still are not confident this is a full accurate representation of the group's TTPs, but should help
nonetheless.

Summary of Attack:
Initial access via BlueKeep RCE (CVE-2019-0708) in RDP in a Windows Server 2008 R2 system
Used the 3proxy[.]ru service to launch attacks from a VPS
Use of Mimikatz to dump LSASS (SYSTEM level privileges are required however, how they obtained
these is currently unclear)
Nmap to identify systems (used Nmap to identify systems with Port 3389 open)
Used RDP to move laterally
Eventually landed on the victim's Domain Controller
Configured TCP port forwarding to open Port 3389 to the internet for persistent access
Deleted data (such as employee records) from live and backup systems

3389 (RDP) -> Port 9003
User Accounts:
They used the default user aaiadmin
Cyber Kill Chain:
Curated Intelligence member, @TrevorGiffen, roughly mapped the intrusion analysis to Cyber Kill Chain,
Diamond Model, and MITRE ATT&CK.
