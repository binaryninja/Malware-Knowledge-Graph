Qakbot Being Distributed via Virtual Disk Files (*.vhd)

December 22, 2022

There’s been a recent increase in the distribution of malware using disk image files. Out of
these, the Qakbot malware has been distributed in ISO and IMG file formats, and the ASEC
analysis team discovered that it has recently changed its distribution to the use of VHD
files. Such use of disk image files (IMG, ISO, VHD) is seen to be Qakbot’s method of
bypassing Mark of the Web (MOTW). Disk image files can bypass the MOTW feature
because when the files inside them are extracted or mounted, MOTW is not inherited to the
files.

The phishing email that distributes Qakbot is shown below. Like in previous cases, it has an
HTML file attachment which generates a compressed file.

1/6

When the attached HTML file is executed, a page that imitates Google Drive is loaded. At
this stage, a compressed file contained in the HTML script is automatically created by the
script. The compressed file is password-protected, and the password can be found on the
HTML page.

2/6

The compressed file contains a VHD file, which is the virtual disk file.

VHD files can be automatically mounted on Windows 8 and onwards, and files are created
internally as shown below.

The properties of the created LNK file are as below, and it executes the reserved.cmd file
created alongside it.

The reserved.cmd command is shown below. It executes the resting.cmd file, parses a
certain string, and transmits it as an argument.

4/6

The resting.cmd command is as follows. This command combines the string received as an
argument and loads the hogs.tmp file through rundll32. The hogs.tmp file is a DLL file and is
the Qakbot malware.

Qakbot is a banking malware that executes the normal process wermgr.exe before injecting
malicious data. The injected process attempts to establish a connection to the C2, and when
the attempt is successful, it performs additional malicious behaviors such as downloading
malicious modules and extorting financial information. The process tree from the execution of
LNK to the execution of Qakbot is as follows.
C2 : 2.14.82[.]210:2222

Recently, there has been a surge in malware using disk image files and various methods of
distribution to bypass security features. Users should refrain from opening emails from
unknown sources and should not execute their attachments. AhnLab’s anti-malware product,
V3, detects and blocks the malware using the alias below.
