A Closer Look at North

From Cybercrime to
Cyberpropaganda

by Daniel Lunghi and Jaromir Horejsi
In today’s online chat and dating scene, romance scams are not uncommon, what
with catﬁshers and West African cybercriminals potently toying with their victims’ emotions to
cash in on their bank accounts. It’s quite odd (and probably underreported), however, to see it used
as a vector for cyberespionage.
We stumbled upon the Confucius hacking group while delving into Patchwork’s cyberespionage
operations, and found a number of similarities. Code in their custom malware bore similarities, for
instance. Confucius targeted a particular set of individuals in South Asian countries, such as
military personnel and businessmen, among others.
Are Patchwork and Confucius the same group? The commands in their backdoors do resemble each
other. The conﬁg ﬁles have a similar, custom structure, and both groups have infrastructure overlap.
However, we construe them to be different groups, possibly within the same community, with
different objectives and modi operandi. While Patchwork may be more straightforward with its
predominantly malware-based attacks, Confucius’ can be inferred to be more nuanced, relying
heavily on social engineering.
Exploiting the human psyche with chat apps
Probing Confucius’ infrastructure, we came across websites offering Windows and Android chat
applications, most likely iterations of its predecessor, Simple Chat Point: Secret Chat Point, and
Tweety Chat. We are admittedly uncertain of the extent — and success — of their use, but it’s one
of the ingredients of the group’s operations.
While the chat applications indeed have real chat features (although the communication is not
anonymous, as advertised), they have backdoor routines and ﬁle-stealing behaviors that get
triggered when speciﬁc words are sent to the app: collecting and harvesting all SMS messages,
contacts, and accounts. Tweety Chat’s Android version can record audio, too. Its latest version can
mute the device (i.e., take out the ringtone and vibration features) and sync call logs and SMSs.

Security Predictions for 2018

Attackers are banking on
network vulnerabilities and
inherent weaknesses to
facilitate massive malware
attacks, IoT hacks, and
operational disruptions. The
ever-shifting threats and
increasingly expanding
attack surface will challenge
users and enterprises to catch
up with their security.

for 2018.

Business Process
Compromise

We further tested Tweety Chat and saw red ﬂags indicating their targets of interest: veriﬁcation
emails with a physical address whose postal code is assigned to a provincial capital that also
appears (upon logging in) as a chat channel in Tweety Chat.
Attackers are starting to
invest in long-term
operations that target speciﬁc
processes enterprises rely on.
They scout for vulnerable
practices, susceptible
systems and operational
loopholes that they can
leverage or abuse. To learn

Romance in cyberespionage
The user list, chat room names, and content of the applications were stored in a remote server
without any authentication. The chat logs shed light on the social engineering used by the operators
to persuade victims to install the cyberespionage malware on their Android devices. The ﬁrst user
and chatroom were created on August 27, 2017, and were probably the app authors’ testing ground.
The succeeding users and chatrooms were created on October 31 and December 12 the latest.
A certain hayat22 and love piqued our interest. hayat22, supposedly a female student, engaged in
an online romance with a target whose handle was love, describing himself as living in South Asia
working in garments manufacturing and wholesaling.
Over the course of their correspondence, love suggested using WhatsApp to
communicate. hayat22 declined, saying she felt safer using Tweety Chat. love refused, but
when hayat22 demurred and gave love an online cold shoulder, love tried installing Tweety Chat —
and failed. He claimed that he wasn’t able to install the app. hayat22 quickly lost interest and
stopped replying to him altogether. She also sent him a screenshot to show what Tweety Chat
looked like.
We’re not sure how love wound up in the chat room or how he met hayat22. He was probably
either using the Windows version of Secret Chat Point or its web interface, which explains
why hayat22 was urging him to install Android Tweety Chat.
In an earlier chat group, an operator called Heena urged the members to install Secret Chat Point on
other people’s mobile devices to get perks like credits or the ability to “go invisible”. In another
chat room called “Maira’s room”, a target of interest disclosed he was a government ofﬁcer
traveling back from a northern city near the country’s provincial capital. A few days after, the
operator stopped answering in the chat room, and her user account was deleted from the server.

A tangled web of malware
Confucius’ operations include deploying bespoke backdoors and stealing ﬁles from their victim’s
systems with tailored ﬁle stealers, some of which bore resemblances to Patchwork’s. The stolen
ﬁles are then exﬁltrated by abusing a cloud storage service. Some of these ﬁle stealers speciﬁcally
target ﬁles from USB devices, probably to overcome air-gapped environments.
Compared to Patchwork, whose Trojanized documents exploit at least ﬁve security ﬂaws,
Confucius’ backdoors are delivered through Ofﬁce ﬁles exploiting memory corruption
vulnerabilities CVE-2015-1641 and CVE-2017-11882. Their malware’s resemblance to that of
Patchwork’s is also notable. The use of an exploit for a security ﬂaw disclosed in December 2017
and their recent activities suggest Confucius is keenly trailing their targets.
Confucius has a miscellany of backdoors: sctrls, ByeBye Shell, remote-access-c3, and
sip_telephone, to name a few. One of its ﬁle stealers, swissknife2, abuses a cloud storage service as
a repository of exﬁltrated ﬁles. At the time of research, there were around 60 victims whose data
were uploaded to Confucius-owned cloud storage account. There were also a few thousand ﬁles in
the account that were later deleted.
Our research, Deciphering Confucius: A Look at the Group’s Cyberespionage Operations,
delves into the group’s operations, the social engineering methods and gamut of malware it uses,
and the countermeasures that organizations can adopt to mitigate them. The list of indicators of
compromise, which includes Trend Micro’s corresponding detections and solutions, is in
this appendix.
