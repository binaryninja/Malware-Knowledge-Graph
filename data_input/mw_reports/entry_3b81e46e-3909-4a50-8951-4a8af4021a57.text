Roundup Highlight: Probable Sandworm Infrastructure

1/5

Sandworm Related Intelligence in ThreatConnect

Our highlight in this Roundup is Incident 20200529A: Network of Probable Sandworm
Infrastructure. Sandworm, also known as Sandworm Team, Quedagh, and VOODOO BEAR,
is a Russian threat actor group that has historically targeted energy, industrial, government,
and media organizations in Ukraine.
ThreatConnect Research, in conjunction with industry colleagues, identified a network of
probable Sandworm infrastructure dating back to at least 2018. NSA released a report on
Sandworm activity on May 29 2020 that identified the domain hostapp.be (IPs:
95.216.13[.]196, 103.94.157[.]5). This domain was registered on December 24 2018 through
Njalla. In reviewing historical registrations, we were only able to identify seven other domains
that were registered on that date through Njalla. While we were unable to directly associate
any of these domains to hostapp.be due to its lack of a creation timestamp, three of the other
domains — fbapp[.]top, fbapp[.]info, fbapp[.]link — appeared notable and possibly related.
2/5

We reviewed the hosting history, subdomains, and co-locations for these additional domains
and to-date have identified a network of 30 domains, 17 IPs, and hundreds of subdomains
that we assess probably are related with largely historic Sandworm activity. Further indicative
of the probable association to Sandworm, some of the identified domains, such as
hostapp[.]art and hostapp[.]link, share strings with the domain identified in NSA’s report.
In reviewing subdomains for the identified domains, many subdomains strings were reused
across the domains. Many Twitter, Google, and Facebook-related subdomains were
identified. The following notable subdomain strings were also identified and possibly are
indicative of operational targets, themes, or affected countries:
passport.abv.bg.*
passport.above.bg.*
mail.bg.*
accounts.ukr.net.*
mail.adm.khv.ru.*
It’s important to note that while the identified infrastructure is largely historic, at least two
domains — userarea[.]click (46.4.10[.]58) and userarea[.]eu (185.226.67[.]190) — and/or
their subdomains were actively resolving in May 2020. At this time, we do not have any
additional insight into how or against whom this infrastructure has been operationalized.

Update 5/31/20
ThreatConnect Research identified another set of domains and IPs that are a part of this
network of probable Sandworm infrastructure. The following domains were registered
through Njalla at essentially the same time as userarea[.]click and userarea[.]eu and are
currently hosted on dedicated servers:
userarea[.]top (194.117.236[.]33)
userarea[.]in (5.255.90[.]243)
Three other domains were registered through Njalla about two and a half hours later:
myaccount[.]click (185.76.68[.]70)
myaccount[.]one (92.62.139[.]114)
webcache[.]one (195.211.197[.]25)
Notably, four of these IP addresses were identified by GreyNoise as exploiting the Exim
vulnerability CVE-2019-10149.

Update 6/3/20

3/5

Two other domains — userzone[.]one and userzone[.]eu — are associated with this network
of infrastructure. These domains were registered through Njalla on November 13 2019, the
same day as those in the previous update. These domains and/or their subdomains have
been hosted on a dedicated server at 141.101.196[.]50.
