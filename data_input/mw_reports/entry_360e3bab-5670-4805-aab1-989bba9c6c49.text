Introduction
In August 2020, Group-IB published the report "UltraRank: the unexpected twist of a JSsniffer triple threat". The report described the operations of the cybercriminal group
UltraRank, which in five years of activity had successfully attacked 691 eCommerce stores
and 13 website service providers.

In November 2020, Group-IB experts discovered a new wave of UltraRank attacks. Even
though new attacks were detected at the time, part of the group's infrastructure remained
active and some sites were still infected. The cybercriminals did not use existing domains for
new attacks but switched to a new infrastructure to store malicious code and collect
intercepted payment data.
As part of UltraRank's new campaign, Group-IB Threat Intelligence and Attribution team
discovered 12 eCommerce websites infected with their JavaScript-sniffer. Eight of them
remain infected at the moment of publication. Group-IB has sent notifications to the infected
websites.
This time the JS sniffer's code was obfuscated using Radix obfuscation. This obfuscation
pattern had been used by only a few cybercriminal groups, one of which was the UltraRank
group (Figure 1). After deobfuscating the code, Group-IB found that the attacks used a
sniffer from the SnifLite family, already known to Group-IB experts and used by the threat
actor UltraRank. Due to the relatively small number of infected websites, the attackers most
likely used the credentials in the CMS administrative panel, which, in turn, could have been
compromised using malware or as a result of brute force attacks.
During their most recent series of attacks UltraRank stored their malicious code on the
website mimicking a legitimate Google Tag Manager domain. The analysis of the threat
actor's infrastructure revealed that the main server was hosted by Media Land LLC, which is
connected with a bullet-proof hosting company.
This blog post examines UltraRank's new campaign, provides recommendations to banks,
payment systems, and online merchants. You'll also find indicators of compromise, attackers'
TTPs and relevant mitigation and defense techniques in accordance with MITRE ATT&CK
and MITRE Shield that we recommend to use to protect against UltraRank.

The SnifLite JS sniffer family has been used by UltraRank since at least January 2019, when
it was utilized in an attack on the Adverline advertising network. Malicious code is uploaded
to the infected website by a link to a JS file located on the website
hXXp://googletagsmanager[.]co/, the domain disguised as a legitimate domain of the Google
Tag Manager googletagmanager.com. The cybercriminals' website
hXXp://googletagsmanager[.]co/ is also used to collect intercepted payment card data as a
sniffer gate (Figure 2).

intercepted cards
The function responsible for intercepting payment information in the SnifLite sniffer family is
shown in Figure 3. The data collection algorithm is based on the function querySelectorAll,
like in the FakeLogistics and WebRank sniffer families used by the group earlier. A
comparison of these three families was outlined in the report "UltraRank: the unexpected
twist of a JS-sniffer triple threat."
After data is collected, it is written to local storage in an object named
google.verify.cache.001.

card data
Data is collected and sent only if the current address of the page where the user is located
contains one of the following keywords (Figure 4):

● onepage
● checkout
● store
● cart
● pay
● panier
● kasse
● order
● billing
● purchase
● basket
Before sending an intercepted payment card, its data is extracted from the
_google.verify.cache.001object stored locally and transmitted to the cybercriminals by
sending an HTTP GET request.

cybercriminals' server
During further analysis of infections by UltraRank, Group-IB team discovered a sample of a
JS sniffer without obfuscation, identical to what was found on one of the cybercriminals'
websites earlier, which linked UltraRank to the new attacks.
Analysis of the infrastructure
While analyzing the sniffer infrastructure, a standard PHP script was found, which is typical
of all of UltraRank's websites. In addition to the common information about the sent request
and the server, the script displayed the server's real IP address. At the time of analysis, the
googletagsmanager[.]co domain had an IP address of 8.208.16[.]230 (AS45102, Alibaba
(US) Technology Co., Ltd.). At the same time, the real server address was 45.141.84[.]239
(Figure 5), owned by Media Land LLC (AS206728). According to an article by Brian Krebs,
Media Land LLC is connected with a bulletproof hosting company operated by an

underground forum user going by the nickname Yalishanda, which provides services to
cybercriminals. Presumably, Yalishanda's service uses cloud servers rented from various
suppliers, including Alibaba, to host part of the cybercriminals' infrastructure.
In addition to the server IP address, the script output also specifies the directory where the
website files are located on the server hXXp://googletagsmanager[.]co/: worker.

googletagsmanager.co is located
The IP address 45.141.84[.]239 is also linked to the website hXXp://s-panel[.]su/. During its
analysis, the same script on all websites in UltraRank's infrastructure was found again
(Figure 6). In this case, the directory where all the website files were located is called panel.

In addition to the common server, Group-IB's Graph Network Analysis system detected the
SSL certificate 50e15969b10d40388bffbb87f56dd83df14576af. This certificate was on both
the domain googletagsmanager.co and the server with the IP address 45.141.84[.]239, which
is associated with the domain s-panel[.]su (Figure 7).

Throughout further analysis of the website hXXp://s-panel[.]su/, a login form was detected.
Presumably, this website is used by the cybercriminals as a sniffer control panel: all stolen
payment card data is collected in the panel for subsequent exfiltration and resale.

The googletagsmanager[.]info domain was also discovered. In September 2020, this domain
had the same IP address as googletagsmanager[.]co (8.208.96.88). However, at the time of
writing, the website was inactive and no cases of eCommerce infections using it were found.

Recommendations
To date, Group-IB experts have studied 96 different JS sniffer families, whereas only 38
malware families of this type were known when the report "Crime without punishment: indepth analysis of JS sniffers" was published. Attacks on eCommerce stores using malicious
JavaScript are becoming an increasingly popular way to obtain large amounts of user
payment information for subsequent resale. As a result of UltraRank installing malicious code
on the Ticketmaster website by hacking the third-party provider Inbenta, user payment data
was leaked. Ticketmaster was fined £1.25 million for this. In addition, British Airways was
fined £20 million for a data leak caused by malicious code injected in one of the JavaScript
libraries used on their website and mobile app. Therefore, the threat of JS sniffers is relevant
not only for owners of eCommerce stores, but also for all services that use and process bank
card payments online. Group-IB experts have compiled a list of recommendations that will
help various eCommerce participants minimize potential damage, prevent infection, or detect
existing malicious activity.
For issuing banks
● Notify users of possible risks arising in the online payment process when using payment
cards.
● If payment cards related to your bank have been compromised, block these cards and
notify the users that the eCommerce store has been infected with a payment card sniffer.

9/11

For eCommerce websites administrators
● Use complex and unique passwords to access the website's admin panel and any services
used for administration, for example phpMyAdmin, Adminer. If possible, set up two-factor
authentication.
● Install all necessary updates for the software used, including CMS of websites. Do not use
outdated or unsupported versions of the CMS. This will help to reduce the risk of servers
being compromised and make it more difficult for an attacker to download a web shell and
install malicious code.
● Regularly check the store for malware and conduct regular security audits of your website.
For example, for websites based on CMS Magento, you can use Magento Security Scan
Tool.
● Use the appropriate systems to log all changes that occur on the website, as well as to log
access to the website's control panel and database and track file change dates. This will help
you to detect website files infected with malicious code, as well as track unauthorized access
to the website or web server.
For payment systems/payment processing banks
● If you provide payment services for eCommerce websites, regularly inform your customers
about basic security techniques when accepting online payments on the websites, as well as
the threat of JavaScript sniffers;
● Ensure that your services use a correctly-configured Content Security Policy;
