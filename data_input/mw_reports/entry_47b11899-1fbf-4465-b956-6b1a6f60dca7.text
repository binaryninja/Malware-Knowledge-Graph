Sofacy II– Same
Sofacy, Different Day

Tactical Intelligence Bulletin
Background
There has been some recent news regarding further activities of a group variously described as
Sofacy1. We are releasing this flash bulletin containing network indicators to aid security
professionals in detecting this activity.
Please contact us on threatintelligence@uk.pwc.com and we would be happy to send you a TLPGREEN version of this report containing further indicators that you are welcome to distribute
further in line with US-CERT definition for TLP.
Recent Reports
In the past few days Trend Micro and FireEye have both released reports relating to similar activity:




Trend 2 described spear phishes containing links to malicious websites that deploy
malware through apparent browser exploits and phishing for web-mail credentials.
FireEye3 have recently described the use of CVE-2015-3043 and CVE-2015-1701 exploits
in suspected Sofacy attacks.

Interestingly, despite the use of zero-day exploits for delivery, there is some evidence that the
attackers continue to use old variants of their malware4.
PwC Threat Intelligence subscribers can refer to CTO-TIB-20150306B published in March 2015
for further details on some of the novel methods we are seeing Sofacy currently employ and the
wider context to this activity.
Please review our earlier bulletin5 or contact us for further information on analysis, targeting
and recommended actions relating to Sofacy’s credential phishing.
