Recorded Future has identified a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group
that we track as Threat Activity Group 22 (TAG-22) targeting
telecommunications, academia, research and development, and government
organizations in Nepal, the Philippines, Taiwan, and more historically, Hong
Kong. In this most recent activity, the group likely used compromised GlassFish
servers and Cobalt Strike in initial access operations before switching to the
bespoke Winnti, ShadowPad, and Spyder backdoors for long-term access
using dedicated actor-provisioned command and control infrastructure.
Background
In September 2020, Recorded Future clients received a report on activity linked
to a user of the shared custom backdoors Winnti and ShadowPad. This activity
targeted a Hong Kong university and airport. The infrastructure and malware
used in these intrusions directly overlap with previous reporting by ESET and
NTT Group on Winnti Group activity. There are also numerous infrastructure
and malware overlaps with activity recently reported by Avast, which described

an installer backdoored with Cobalt Strike found on the official website of
MonPass, a major certification authority (CA) in Mongolia. Both the
ShadowPad and Winnti backdoors are shared across multiple Chinese activity
groups. Winnti in particular has been historically used by both APT41/Barium
and APT17 and is commonly associated with activity linked to multiple groups
of loosely connected private contractors operating on behalf of China’s Ministry
of State Security (MSS). In this case, Insikt Group tracks the cluster of activity
described in this and our previous report using the temporary name Threat
Activity Group 22 (TAG-22), while we note some historical overlap with activity
clustered as APT41 and Barium by FireEye and Microsoft, respectively.
Victimology and Use of Compromised GlassFish Infrastructure
Insikt Group tracks known infrastructure and domains linked to TAG-22 using a
combination of passive DNS data and adversary C2 detection techniques for
ShadowPad, Winnti, and the Spyder Backdoor. In June 2021, we identified
TAG-22 intrusions targeting the following organizations in Taiwan, Nepal, and
the Philippines using Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) data:
The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan
Nepal Telecom
Department of Information and Communications Technology (The
Philippines)
In particular, the targeting of the ITRI is notable due to its role as a technology
research and development institution that has set up and incubated multiple
Taiwanese technology firms. According to the ITRI’s website, the organization
is particularly focused on research and development projects related to smart
living, quality health, sustainable environment, and technology, many of which
map to development priorities under China’s 14th 5-year plan, previously
highlighted by Insikt Group as likely areas of future Chinese economic
espionage efforts. In recent years, Chinese groups have targeted multiple
organizations across Taiwan’s semiconductor industry to obtain source code,
software development kits, and chip designs.
While we believe these 4 organizations were likely the intended end targets of
TAG-22 intrusion activity, we also identified several suspected compromised
GlassFish Servers communicating with TAG-22 C2 infrastructure. This is in line
with recent NTT reporting, which identified the group exploiting GlassFish
Server software version 3.1.2 and below and using the compromised
infrastructure to conduct onward intrusion activity, specifically scanning using
the Acunetix scanner and deploying the Cobalt Strike offensive security tool
(OST). Per NTT researchers, the group likely used this infrastructure in the

early stages of intrusions before transitioning to dedicated infrastructure for
controlling ShadowPad, Spyder, and Winnti implants. For its dedicated
infrastructure, TAG-22 primarily used domains registered via Namecheap and
Choopa (Vultr) virtual private servers (VPS) for hosting.
Nepal Telecom Tradecraft Case Study
By querying the TAG-22 C2 domain vt.livehost[.]live in the Recorded Future
Threat Intelligence Platform, we identified links to the Shadowpad and Spyder
backdoors that combine Recorded Future C2 detections and passive DNS
data.

Recorded Future)
This allows us to pivot and identify the TAG-22 IP address 139.180.141[.]227,
which we have detected being used by the group for both Shadowpad and
Spyder command and control.

In addition to identifying additional related malicious infrastructure, using
Network Traffic Analysis Exfiltration Events, we were also able to pinpoint
specific victims of TAG-22 activity. The screenshot above shows an exfiltration
event from the Nepal Telecom IP to the Shadowpad and Spyder backdoor C2
139.180.141[.]227, which hosted the domain vt.livehost[.]live at the time of
exfiltration. While the victim IP address is assigned to Nepal Telecom, for
telecommunication companies, this is often insufficient for attributing the true
victim organization because the majority of infrastructure owned by those
entities is leased or provided to its customers. In this case, we can use the
new, proprietary VPN and Geographical Information extension alongside other
enrichments to try to pinpoint the victim of this activity.

By clicking on the Google Maps view within the VPN and Geographical
Information extension for this IP address, we can pinpoint a location and
confirm that Nepal Telecom is likely the victim of this activity — the location
directly points to Nepal Telecom’s head office in Kathmandu.

Malware Analysis
Through analyzing the identified TAG-22 operational infrastructure, we
identified several Cobalt Strike samples likely used by the group to gain an
initial foothold in the target environment. The group also used a custom Cobalt
6/9

Strike loader the malware authors appear to have called Fishmaster based on
a debugging string present within several samples:
(C:\Users\test\Desktop\fishmaster\x64\Release\fishmaster.pdb)
The string “fish_master” was also present across others.
For initial access, the group typically used double extensions for Fishmaster
Portable Executable (PE) files to make them appear like Microsoft Office or
PDF files:

- 履歷-王宣韓.docx.exe
In each case, following execution, the user is shown a decoy document, such
as the resume shown below for a likely Taiwanese national. In other instances,
the group used malicious macros to drop the Fishmaster loader. As both
sample lure documents are written in traditional Chinese characters and the CV
features a Taiwanese university, and because the group has more widely
targeted Taiwan, we believe that Taiwanese organizations were likely the
targets for these particular lures.

Many of the Cobalt Strike beacon payloads used by TAG-22 across this
campaign were configured using the Backoff malleable C2 profile, which
contains the following high level network traffic characteristics:

User Agent: “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/24.0"
HTTP POST URI (multiple choices):
/windebug/updcheck.php
/aircanada/dark.php
/aero2/fly.php
/windowsxp/updcheck.php
/hello/flash.php
HTTP GET URI:
/updates

All of the configurations contain the watermark 305419896, which is associated
with a cracked version of Cobalt Strike.
Outlook
At this time, Insikt Group continues to track TAG-22 activity as an independent
activity cluster that overlaps with the wider group defined as Winnti Group by
ESET. TAG-22 uses shared custom backdoors likely unique to Chinese statesponsored groups, including ShadowPad and Winnti, while also employing
open-source or offensive security tools such as Cobalt Strike and Acunetix.
TAG-22’s continued use of publicly reported infrastructure is indicative of a
group experiencing a high degree of operational success despite a breadth of
public reporting regarding its operations. Insikt Group has primarily identified
TAG-22 operating within Asia. However, apart from this campaign, the group
has a relatively broad targeting scope both geographically and by industry. This
wider targeting scope, coupled with the use of the Winnti backdoor, is typical of
several suspected MSS contractors, including APT17 and APT41.
