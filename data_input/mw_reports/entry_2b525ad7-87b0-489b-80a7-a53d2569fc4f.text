In our newest category #ShortAndMalicious DCSO CyTec aims to briefly highlight new and interesting samples we
come across in our daily hunt for malware.
For the first entry in the series, we take a brief look at an undocumented custom malware we have been analysing
under the moniker “StrelaStealer” (“Стрела” == arrow) which appears to be purpose-built to steal mail login data.
PDB path contained in StrelaStealer samples
DCSO CyTec first discovered StrelaStealer early November 2022 distributed via ISO files with what appears to be
Spanish targets based on used lure documents. It is unclear at this point in time if StrelaStealer is part of a targeted
attack.

Execution via polyglot
StrelaStealer samples are distributed in ISO files with varying content. In one instance, StrelaStealer uses a
renamed msinfo32.exe to sideload StrelaStealer as slc.dll. Another, more interesting variant distributes StrelaStealer
as a DLL/HTML polyglot.
Polyglots files are files that are valid as two or more different file formats. In this case, StrelaStealer uses a file that is
both valid as a DLL as well as an HTML page.
Execution of StrelaStealer via polyglot
The ISO file contains two files, one Factura.lnk and the polyglot x.html file. The LNK file then executes
x.html twice, once as a DLL and a second time as an HTML file.

Inspecting x.html then shows that it simply contains HTML code appended to the DLL file:

Double-clicking it opens the browser and displays the lure document:

Malware analysis
StrelaStealer samples are DLL files, with the main functionality triggered by calling its main export function named
Strela or s . While its code is not obfuscated, strings are encrypted with a cyclic xor with a hardcoded key:
Hardcoded xor key
Once executed, StrelaStealer attempts to locate and steal mail login data from Thunderbird and Outlook.
For Thunderbird, StrelaStealer searches for logins.json and key4.db in the
%APPDATA%\Thunderbird\Profiles\ directory and sends the file contents to its C2.
For Outlook, StrelaStealer enumerates the registry
key HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles\Outlook\9375CFF0413111d3B88A00104B2A6676\
in order to find the values IMAP User , IMAP Server and IMAP Password . StrelaStealer then decrypts the
IMAP Password using CryptUnprotectData before sending the triple to its C2.

Communication
Communication is done using plain HTTP POSTs, with the payload encrypted using the same xor key as for the
strings. C2 server and resource name are hardcoded and so far all samples were configured for the same one:
hxxp://193.106.191[.]166/server.php

The IP address is hosted on known Russian bulletproof hosting “Kanzas LLC” with the /24 likely being hosted in
Moscow.
Stolen files from Thunderbird are sent home in the following format:
[prefix "FF"][DWORD size logins.json][contents of logins.json][contents of key4.db]

Outlook data uses the following format:
[prefix "OL"][Server1,User1,Password1][Server2,User2,Password2]...

When sending home data, StrelaStealer checks for the last two bytes of the response to be KH which appears to
signal a successful transfer and causes StrelaStealer to quit, otherwise it retries to send the data again after a 1
second sleep.

IoCs
As usual, you can find below the IoCs. We share a MISP event on our GitHub.
