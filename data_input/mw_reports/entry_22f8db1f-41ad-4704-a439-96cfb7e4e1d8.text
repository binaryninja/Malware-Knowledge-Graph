Figure 1. Spear phishing email from Pawn Storm – collected in August 2020.
Starting from August 2020, Pawn Storm has sent several spear phishing emails with a malicious RAR attachment. Among the earliest samples
we received were two almost identical RAR files that contained a file called info.exe. Both versions of the info.exe files are self-extracting
archives (SFX) that extract and execute two files: decrypt.exe and gdrive.exe. We have:
c4a61b581890f575ba0586cf6d7d7d3e0c7603ca40915833d6746326685282b7 installing
decrypt.exe – 661d4a0d877bac9b813769a85c01bce274a77b29ccbd4b71e5b92df3c425b93b
gdrive.exe – cbd9cb7b69f864ce8bae983ececb7cf8627f9c17fdaba74bd39baa5cdf605f79

Decoy File

1/6

We noticed that the file decrypt.exe is a decoy file that will run once info.exe is executed. The application will only show a message box
wherein a user can type a password for decryption. Checking the disassembly of this file reveals that it only shows another message box when
a password is entered on the main application.

Figures 2-3. The message box that decrypt.exe displays

After closing this application, the file gdrive.exe will be executed by the SFX archive. The different versions of gdrive.exe are almost identical,
with a minor addition to the file 2060f1e108f5feb5790320c38931e3dc6c7224edf925bf6f1840351578bbf9cc of base64 encoding on the victim’s
id.

Initial Run
The first thing this malware does is it copies itself to the startup directory for persistence. It does this via cmd.exe with the following command:
move /Y "{malware_location}"
"C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\gdrive.exe"
Every time the malware runs a command using cmd.exe, the standard output (STDOUT) of the executed command is piped and written to a
Google Drive account with the following filename format:
{utcnow}_report_{victim’s id}

Figure 6. Code snippet showing the execution of

commands
The client key and token used to read and write the attacker’s Google Drive account is hardcoded on the malware itself.

Figures 7-8.

Sending back the information through Google Drive will allow the attacker to check if the machine that executed the malware was the intended
victim they wanted to target.

Receiving commands and data exfiltration
Every 20 minutes, the bot checks for a file in Google Drive. If a file with a corresponding filename format exist (cmd_{victim’s id}), it downloads
that file and runs the contents as a batch file.

Figure 9. Code snippets showing waiting for commands

Again, the STDOUT of the commands will be written back to Google Drive as a result. This works as a reverse shell back to the attacker with
Google Drive as the Command and Control (C&C) server.
The command file that the bot received from Google Drive will also be deleted once it is downloaded.

Figure 10. Code snippets showing

readFile
Using the “reverse shell” method mentioned above, the attacker can exfiltrate data/documents using the following commands:
powershell -command "[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('{filename}')

Figure 11. Code snippets showing
the exfiltration of data
The secondary payload with the filename Google Drivemonitor.exe
(0b94e123f6586967819fa247cdd58779b1120ef93fa1ea1de70dffc898054a09) is a keylogger. The collected keystrokes are stored in the same
directory from which the malware was executed.

Figure 12.

Code snippets showing keylogs
This secondary payload does not have any function to upload the collected keystrokes back to the attacker. However, since the main malware
acts as a “reverse shell,” the attacker can retrieve the collected keystrokes at a later time.
Eventually, the threat actor added improvements to the malware, like encryption. Later the actor started to use IMAP RATs as well.

keylogger

TrojanSpy.MSIL.KEYLOGGR

A defender who finds a simple remote access trojan (RAT) in the network won’t immediately think it was from an advanced persistent threat
(APT) actor. Likewise, brute force attacks on internet-facing services like email, Microsoft Autodiscover, SMB, LDAP, and SQL are so common
that they may seem like background noise that can be ignored. But in 2020, the notorious APT actor Pawn Storm used exactly these nonsophisticated attack methods to such an extent that their attacks may get lost in the noise.
In 2020 Pawn Storm spread simple Google Drive and IMAP Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to attack their usual targets, such as ministries of
foreign affairs, embassies, the defense industry and the military. The RATs were also sent to a wider net of targets including various industries
around the world. The group also performed widespread brute force attacks to steal credentials such as those of corporate email accounts, as
evidenced by network probes we attribute to Pawn Storm and the loose way the actor abused compromised email accounts in malware and in
sending spear-phishing emails. Pawn Storm even hardcoded compromised military and government-related email addresses in their IMAP
RAT malware to communicate with victims’ computers. Recently, Norwegian authorities announced that Pawn Storm hacked the Norwegian
parliament through brute force attacks.
As shown in incremental improvements, subsequent versions of the malware hint towards a learning curve of the malware author that is more
typical for an inexperienced actor than for an advanced actor. First, the RATs were so simple that they did not even take into account
international keyboards. This means it would be difficult for the attacker to enumerate the victims’ hard drives with files and folders that contain
international characters. This mistake was corrected swiftly, but it shows the relative inexperience of this particular Pawn Storm operator. Later
versions of the RAT malware started to use encryption, which could have been added right from the start. The only secondary payload we
observed was a simple keylogger that stores stolen information locally on the victims’ machines.
Attribution to Pawn Storm of these malware samples would be difficult with only the samples at hand. Typically, a network defender would not
attribute this kind of malware to an APT actor at all. However, we have solid attribution for these samples based on our long-term monitoring of
Pawn Storm’s activities.
Recap of recent Pawn Storm activities
Compromising accounts of users from the Middle East
Trend Micro has been closely and consistently monitoring the activities of Pawn Storm, and in March 2020, we released our latest research on
the group. In the aforementioned research paper, we shared that Pawn Storm heavily abuses compromised accounts — mainly in the Middle
East — to send spear-phishing emails. The abuse of compromised email accounts in the Middle East continued in 2020. For example, in early
December 2020 the group used a VPN service to connect to a compromised cloud server, then used the cloud server to connect to a
commercial business email service provider. The group then logged in to a compromised email account of a chicken farm in Oman, and then
sent out credential phishing spam messages to high-profile targets around the world. This shows that Pawn Storm is careful at obfuscating
their tracks on multiple levels.
The abuse of various compromised email accounts in the Middle East started in May 2019 and continues today. Since August 2020, they didn’t
use these email addresses to only send spear-phishing emails, but also as a way to communicate with compromised systems in IMAP RATs.
Brute force attacks
We think that Pawn Storm compromises lots of email accounts through brute force attacks on internet-facing services like email, LDAP,
Microsoft Autodiscover, SMB, and SQL. For example, in May 2020, Pawn Storm scanned IP addresses worldwide, including IP addresses
from the defense industry in Europe, on TCP port 445 and 1433, likely in an attempt to find vulnerable SMB and SQL servers or brute force
credentials. In August 2020, Pawn Storm also sent UDP probes to LDAP servers around the world from one of their dedicated IP addresses.
In 2020, Pawn Storm often tries to obfuscate these brute force attempts by routing their attack traffic over Tor and VPN servers. Yet this is not
always enough to hide these activities. In a Microsoft article about brute-forcing Office365 credentials over Tor, Microsoft attributed the
activities to Strontium, which is another name for Pawn Storm. We wrote about related attacks in early 2020. These brute force attacks started
in 2019, and then we could firmly attribute them to Pawn Storm because we could cross-relate the extensive probing of Microsoft Autodiscover
servers around the world with high-confidence indicators of the group’s more traditional attack methods (spear phishing and credential
phishing).
To illustrate the simplicity of the malware in Pawn Storm’s recent spear-phishing attacks, we describe one example below:
