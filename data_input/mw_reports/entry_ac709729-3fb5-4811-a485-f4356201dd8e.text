The Most Prolific Ransomware Families: A Defenders
Guide
domaintools.com/resources/blog/the-most-prolific-ransomware-families-a-defenders-guide

Executive Summary
Ransomware dominates the news cycle, but with an ever-growing number of variants and
the botnets behind them it’s easy for defenders to lose track of their relationships. In this
article, DomainTools researchers provide a look at the three most prolific (by victim)
ransomware families and the current loaders they use.

Ransom-every-ware
The current cybersecurity news cycle seems entirely dominated by the ransomware scene
as major pipelines are interrupted, the meat supply chain grinds to a halt, and
manufacturers across the board shutter while getting their networks in order. Ransomware
gangs appear to be multiplying and new groups are claiming their ties to older groups to
gain clout and scaring their victims into payment. Affiliate programs are recruiting on hacker
forums while initial access brokers are selling footholds into corporate networks. There is a
vast underground economy booming around the ransomware scene today.

In all of this, it’s easy to get lost when examining infections as the deluge of incidents
continues. Malware families like TrickBot, Ryuk, Dridex, BazarLoader, and DoppelPaymer
certainly don’t make things any easier for defenders. Ransomware gangs or affiliate groups
being confounded with their tooling names muddle things even further. Couple that with the
fact that most of these hacker tools have precursor tools that lead to infections, a
partnership where a botnet operator, after acquiring what they need from a network, then
sells access or directly works with ransomware groups for a cut of their take. These
partnerships are akin to partnerships in the corporate world: for example, a TrickBot
infection often leads to Conti or Ryuk ransomware or a Qakbot infection leads to a REvil
ransomware. These ties and alliances shift as new botnets and groups bloom and fade.
Through this article, DomainTools research will give a lay of the land, as it stands today, and
which infections lead to what outcomes, properties of those infections, and how to spot
them. We’ll concentrate on the top three most prolific ransomware families by number of
victims Conti, Maze (and in turn Egregor, more on that later), and Sodinokibi (REvil) to
provide you with a better comprehension of what you read in the ever-evolving ransomware
news cycle.

An Important Reminder On Affiliates
DomainTools researchers feel that it is important to remind readers that all of these groups
make alliances, share tools, and sell access to one another. Nothing in this space is static
and even though there is a single piece of software behind a set of intrusions there are
likely several different operators using that same piece of ransomware that will tweak its
operation to their designs.
The playbook of the affiliate programs that many of these ransomware authors run is to
design a piece of ransomware and then sell it off for a percentage of the ransom gained.
Think of it as a cybercrime multi-level marketing scheme. Often there is a builder tool that
allows the affiliate to customize the ransomware to their needs for a specific target which at
the same time tweaks the software slightly so it can evade standard, static detection
mechanisms. This article’s intent is not to dive deep into tracking individual affiliates or into
each of the stages of a piece of packed malware (looking at you, CobaltStrike), but just to
the top level of software used and their relations.
Lastly, we must mention that access for the ransomware is often being provided by an initial
backdoor or botnet, frequently called an initial access broker. These backdoors, sometimes
referred to as remote access trojans (RATs), are first dropped by a downloader, another
piece of simple, obfuscated software that is usually distributed by spam emails with
malicious documents of varying types. Sometimes, the people behind these RATs and
ransomware families will also obtain access by password spraying techniques or exploiting
old vulnerabilities that might be present on aging systems exposed on corporate networks.
We will include those steps in our explanations.
All in all, what this shows is that the problem space to look in for a robust defense
solution isn’t necessarily at the ransomware itself, but the methods of initial access
through spam email campaigns, brute force attacks, and vulnerability management.
Rarely are the affiliates behind the ransomware infection actually the same entity
acquiring initial access.

Conti
First observed in December 2019, Conti is suspected to be operated by the same group
that is behind the Ryuk ransomware, known for its rapid cycles of initial access to
ransomware infection. Like many groups, they operate a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
offering and have a leak site that they leverage against victims for double extortion. While
distributed by the TrickBot botnet in the past, Conti is often seen now being distributed by
Bazar and IcedID (aka BokBot). What’s interesting here is that IcedID was also known to be
distributed by the prolific Emotet botnet which distributed TrickBot and Ryuk in the past as
well. All of these connections lead most to believe that the groups behind all of these pieces
of malicious software are connected and working together.

3/7

Conti is unique in that when encrypting victim data with AES256, the software uses a
multithreaded approach which makes the execution much faster than other malware
families. This can mean that by the time defenders notice the Conti infection on one
machine, it’s far too late to remediate. The ties to older groups such as Ryuk, having
operated since 2018, and the improvement in capabilities and speed indicate that Conti is
the next iteration of software for these gangs and the most deadly of the current malware
families. Additionally, the fact that Conti is one of the few RaaS programs that sometimes
gains initial access on its own shows a higher level of sophistication than some other
affiliate groups.
Lastly, we want to call out Bazar for a piece of uniqueness uncovered by the domain namespecific research that DomainTools conducts. Bazar uses EmerDNS blockchain-based
domains. This is an alternative domain registry which uses EmerCoin as the blockchain,
meaning the domains cannot be taken down or sinkholed to disrupt the botnet’s
communications as this is an entirely separate DNS not under anyone’s control. Use of
these blockchain domains has been slowly on the rise in malicious softwares and produces
a significant problem for defenders.

Maze and Egregor
The Maze ransomware group remains one of the most prolific ransomware affiliate
programs with such a vast number of infections that they still exist in the top ten infections
of all time even though the affiliate program announced their retirement in November 2020
after only forming in 2019. Maze, previously called ChaCha for its use of the ChaCha
encryption algorithm, was also the first RaaS to develop a leaks site and attempt to get
victims to pay using double extortion—something that’s common for all new ransomware
programs today. For that reason we couldn’t leave them off this list even though most of
their affiliates moved on to using the Egregor ransomware, first appearing in September
2020, after Maze’s retirement.
Maze used off-the-shelf exploit kits such as Fallout or Spelevo and spam campaigns that
have downloaders that install Cobalt Strike Beacon. Beacon is a commercial, full-featured
RAT that is found in almost all infection chains these days. Despite claiming to be a tool for
red teams and penetration testers, Cobalt Strike is so full-featured, particularly its modular
command and control in Beacon, that bad actors have taken the tool up without abandon.
Most infection chains have an instance of Beacon in them somewhere, including with Conti
above.
What’s important to note here is that the Egregor ransomware family departs from Maze in
that it follows a similar model to Conti where external exploits against RDP, similar to Conti,
are used as well as spam mail with malicious documents to drop the Qakbot (AKA Qbot)
worm. Qakbot is a commodity malware, available since 2007, that is available on a number
of underground forums and used by several ransomware families. Muddying waters even
further, Qakbot has been seen being dropped by Emotet in some infections and tied to
4/7

several ransomware families in the past outside Egregor, such as ProLock and
LockerGoga. The Egregor attacks using RDP to gain an initial foothold lead some to believe
that some Egregor affiliates are confident in breaching networks directly while others are
relying on initial access brokers who are less skilled leveraging commodity malware.

REvil (Sodinokibi)
The REvil ransomware family first appeared in April 2019 and is thought, due to code
similarities, to be the spiritual successor to GandCrab, an earlier ransomware variant that
targeted consumers. Similar to many other ransomware variants, REvil checks on startup if
the computer’s language region is set to an allowlisted country, typically a nation outside of
the CIS nations such as Kazakhstan and Russia. Much like other families, REvil operates a
leak site where they have for instance offered up stolen Apple blueprints.
REvil also has a number of unique features that make the malware particularly sinister. For
instance, REvil samples will attempt to escalate privileges by constantly spamming the user
with an administrator login prompt or will reboot into Windows Safe Mode to encrypt files, as
antivirus software rarely runs in safe mode. The software also uses a custom packer to
disguise itself which makes analysis difficult for less talented reverse engineers. Separate
from the previous two families discussed, REvil uses the AES or Salsa20 encryption
algorithms on victim files which is a slightly unique signature. These unique features along
with the RaaS’ success has led to some new gangs, such as Prometheus, claiming to be a
part of REvil to encourage victim payment.
As for distribution, REvil affiliates have been seen using a spam campaign to deliver
malicious documents and exploit kits targeting old vulnerabilities on unpatched machines as
well as most recently through Qakbot. This new relationship of being distributed through the
Qakbot worm brings REvil into line with the many other families that have been distributed
by botnets in the past. With the speed at which many of these ransomware groups are now
moving and the money involved, purchasing access from botnet operators into valuable
victim networks is more effective than individual targeting of companies for most affiliates.

Ransomware Map
While the previous three families may be the most prominent in terms of victim market
share, there remains an ever growing number of ransomware gangs and families to keep
track of in the rapid news cycle. These three families also offer a glimpse into what most of
the ransomware market looks like as far as infection vectors and chains are concerned.
With those as a basis, we offer the was a guide below to help with interpreting any articles
encountered on ransomware. As with any ancient map there are portions of unknown
territories (here be dragons) and portions that may rapidly shift from the time when this map
was made. Tactics and techniques change, relationships change, but this is the market
slightly untangled from the DomainTools research perspective at the time of this publishing.
