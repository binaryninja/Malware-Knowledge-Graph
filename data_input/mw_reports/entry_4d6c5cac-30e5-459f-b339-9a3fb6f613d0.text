Over the past two weeks, Morphisec Labs has identified an increase in AVE_MARIA
malware infecting victims through a variety of phishing methods. One of the downloader
components and C2 metadata are similar to those we saw in the Orcus RAT attacks last
month and we believe they are by the same threat actor.
AVE_MARIA is an advanced information stealer malware, described in this Yoroi Lab post
about an earlier attack on an Italian oil and gas company. It is a relatively new malware, with
its first documented appearance towards the end of 2018.
While previous coverage of the malware reported the use of AutoIt as part of the
AVE_MARIA downloader stage, the campaign identified by Morphisec uses additional, more
advanced stealth methods to deliver the same information stealer. More specifically, we have
identified the adoption of Orcus RAT delivery stages and Revenge RAT fileless components
that execute reconnaissance and hollowing attacks on legitimate Windows processes to
avoid being detected.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
Phishing
Following a successful email phishing campaign, a malicious VBScript is executed. This
VBScript contains a PowerShell command that downloads an initial Recon stage component.

->

-> After additional deobfuscation steps, we get to the final PowerShell execution.

First Stage Recon Download
The first stage PowerShell command downloads the RevengeRat component directly into
memory (filename â€“ Nuclear Explosion.exe) from pastee.ee, a popular free available text
storage site. This component is identified by its Mutex and strings metadata (RV_MUTEX).

3/8

The component communicates with its C2, sends all the basic information from the computer
(what are the running processes, installed AVs, Username, Machine, system drives and
more) as part of a reconnaissance stage, then executes the next stage PowerShell
command.

Second Stage Downloader
Both the AVE_MARIA and the downloader are not part of the original second stage
PowerShell command that is executed following the described first stage. This makes it very
unlikely that runtime detection solutions will detect the malware. The same downloader and
the information stealer are stored on paste.ee and therefore also cannot be categorized as
low reputation URL. The first URL represents the Downloader, which executes a known
process hollowing technique on a legitimate Windows process (RegAsm.exe). This is done
to bypass whitelisting. The same module was also used as part of the previously described
Orcus RAT campaign.

4/8

The Downloader is obfuscated by automatic tools and can easily be de-obfuscated by
de4dot. After deobfuscation, we clearly see that the script calls C.M method and invoke R
function. This, in turn, executes process hollowing by the book on a 32 bit process,
CreateProcess in suspend, Unmap and Map and then resume thread on the written data.

5/8

AVE_MARIA
The Information stealer is the same as that described by Yoroi Lab in a previous attack.

As reported, the privilege escalation used by the malware is an old fashion elevated PkgMgr>DISM Dll hijacking vulnerability for UAC bypass. The privilege escalation itself is executed
by an additional executable, which is embedded as resource inside the malware.

6/8

The malware communicates with 194.5.98[.]139, which was previously identified as a C2 for
the Orcus RAT campaign.

Conclusions
There is an obvious adaptation of various memory evasion techniques by the different
hacker groups. The only way to combat this type of evasion is change the game on attackers
and make their target unpredictable.
Morphisec applies Moving Target Defense and deterministically prevents this type of attacks
without prior knowledge.
