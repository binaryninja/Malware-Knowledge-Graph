ESET Research has found LuckyMouse, Tick, Winnti Group, and Calypso, among others, are likely using the recent
Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to compromise email servers all around the world
ESET Research has found LuckyMouse, Tick, Winnti Group, and Calypso, among others, are likely using the recent
Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to compromise email servers all around the world
On 2021-03-02, Microsoft released out-of-band patches for Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, 2016 and 2019. These
security updates fixed a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability chain (CVE-2021-26855, CVE2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065) that allows an attacker to take over any reachable Exchange
server, without even knowing any valid account credentials. We have already detected webshells on more than 5,000
email servers as of the time of writing, and according to public sources, several important organizations, such as the
European Banking Authority, suffered from this attack.
ESET customers are advised to read the following articles for information related to ESET products:
A Microsoft Exchange saga: How is ESET technology protecting business customers post-exploitation? (ESET Corporate
Blog)
Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities discovered and exploited in-the-wild (ESET Customer Advisory)
Does ESET protect me from the Hafnium zero-day exploit in Microsoft Exchange? (ESET Knowledgebase)

1/11

These vulnerabilities were first discovered by Orange Tsai, a well-known vulnerability researcher, who reported them to
Microsoft on 2021-01-05. However, according to a blogpost by Volexity, in-the-wild exploitation had already started on
2021-01-03. Thus, if these dates are correct, the vulnerabilities were either independently discovered by two different
vulnerability research teams or that information about the vulnerabilities was somehow obtained by a malicious entity.
Microsoft also published a blogpost about the early activity of Hafnium.
On 2021-02-28, we noticed that the vulnerabilities were used by other threat actors, starting with Tick and quickly joined
by LuckyMouse, Calypso and the Winnti Group. This suggests that multiple threat actors gained access to the details of
the vulnerabilities before the release of the patch, which means we can discard the possibility that they built an exploit by
reverse engineering Microsoft updates.

Finally, the day after the release of the patch, we started to see many more threat actors (including Tonto Team and
Mikroceen) scanning and compromising Exchange servers en masse. Interestingly, all of them are APT groups interested
in espionage, except for one outlier (DLTMiner), which is linked to a known cryptomining campaign. A summary of the
timeline is shown in Figure 1.

Exploitation statistics
For the past few days, ESET researchers have been monitoring closely the number of webshell detections for these
exploits. At the date of publication, we had observed more than 5,000 unique servers in over 115 countries where
webshells were flagged. These numbers utilize ESET telemetry and are (obviously) not complete. Figure 2 illustrates
these detections before and after the patch from Microsoft.

The heatmap in Figure 3 shows the geographical distribution of the webshell detections, according to ESET telemetry.
Due to mass exploitation, it is likely that it represents the distribution of vulnerable Exchange servers around the world on
which ESET security products are installed.

From RCE to webshells to backdoors
We have identified more than 10 different threat actors that likely leveraged the recent Microsoft Exchange RCE in order
to install implants on victims’ email servers.
Our analysis is based on email servers on which we found webshells in Offline Address Book (OAB) configuration files,
which is a specific technique used in the exploitation of the RCE vulnerability and has already been detailed in a Unit 42
blogpost. Unfortunately, we cannot discount the possibility that some threat actors might have hijacked the webshells
dropped by other groups rather than directly using the exploit.

3/11

Once the vulnerability had been exploited and the webshell was in place, we observed attempts to install additional
malware through it. We also noticed in some cases that several threat actors were targeting the same organization.

Tick
On 2021-02-28, Tick (also known as Bronze Butler) compromised the webserver of a company based in East Asia that
provides IT services. This means that the group likely had access to the exploit prior to the patch’s release – in this case
at least two days before.
The attacker used the following name for the first-stage webshell:
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\aspnet.aspx
We then observed a Delphi backdoor, highly similar to previous Delphi implants used by the group. C&C addresses used
by this backdoor are www.averyspace[.]net and www.komdsecko[.]net.
Tick is an APT group active since as early as 2008 and targeting organizations primarily based in Japan but also in South
Korea, Russia and Singapore amongst others. Its main objective seems to be intellectual property and classified
information theft. It makes use of various proprietary malware such as Daserf, xxmm and Datper as well as open source
RATs such as Lilith. Tick is among the APT groups now having access to the ShadowPad backdoor, which was used
during Operation ENTRADE documented by Trend Micro.

LuckyMouse
On 2021-03-01, LuckyMouse compromised the email server of a governmental entity in the Middle East, which means
this APT group likely had access to the exploit at least one day before the patch release, when it was still a zero day.
LuckyMouse operators started by dropping the Nbtscan tool in C:\programdata\, then installed a variant of the ReGeorg
webshell and issued a GET request to http://34.90.207[.]23/ip using curl. Finally, they attempted to install their SysUpdate
(aka Soldier) modular backdoor that uses the aforementioned IP address as its C&C server.
LuckyMouse, also known as APT27 and Emissary Panda, is a cyberespionage group known to have breached multiple
government networks in Central Asia and the Middle East but also transnational organizations such as International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016. It uses various custom malware families such as HyperBro and SysUpdate.

Calypso
On 2021-03-01, Calypso compromised the email servers of governmental entities in the Middle East and in South
America, which means the group likely had access to the exploit as a zero day, like LuckyMouse and Tick. In the
following days, Calypso operators targeted additional servers of governmental entities and private companies in Africa,
Asia and Europe using the exploit.
The attacker used the following names for the first-stage webshell:
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\client.aspx
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\discover.aspx
As part of these attacks, two different backdoors were observed: a variant of PlugX specific to the group
(Win32/Korplug.ED) and a custom backdoor that we detect as Win32/Agent.UFX (known as Whitebird in a Dr.Web
report). These tools are loaded using DLL search-order hijacking against legitimate executables (also dropped by the
attackers):
netcfg.exe (SHA-1: 1349EF10BDD4FE58D6014C1043CBBC2E3BB19CC5) using a malicious DLL named
netcfg.dll (SHA-1: EB8D39CE08B32A07B7D847F6C29F4471CD8264F2)
CLNTCON.exe (SHA-1: B423BEA76F996BF2F69DCC9E75097635D7B7A7AA) using a malicious DLL named
SRVCON.OCX (SHA-1: 30DD3076EC9ABB13C15053234C436406B88FB2B9)
iPAQDetetion2.exe (SHA-1: C5D8FEC2C34572F5F2BD4F6B04B75E973FDFEA32) using a malicious DLL named
rapi.dll (SHA-1: 4F0EA31A363CFE0D2BBB4A0B4C5D558A87D8683E)

4/11

The backdoors were configured to connect to the same C&C servers: yolkish[.]com and rawfuns[.]com.
Finally, we also observed a variant of a tool known as Mimikat_ssp that is available on GitHub.
Calypso (which is also tied to XPATH) is a cyberespionage group targeting governmental institutions in Central Asia, the
Middle East, South America and Asia. Its main implant is a variant of the PlugX RAT.

Websiic
Starting 2021-03-01, ESET researchers observed a new cluster of activity we have named Websiic, targeting seven
email servers belonging to private companies (in the domains of IT, telecommunications and engineering) in Asia and a
governmental body in Eastern Europe. As observed in the cases above, the operators behind this cluster likely had
access to the exploit before the patch’s release.
This cluster was identified by the presence of a loader as its first stage, generally named google.log or google.aspx, and
an encrypted configuration file, generally named access.log. The loader stops a specific service identified in the config
and creates a new entry under the Windows service registry HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
<servicename>\Parameters (the service’s filename is provided by the config). It sets two keys ServiceDll and
ServiceMain. The first one contains the path to a DLL while the latter contains the export to call (INIT in this case).
Finally, it restarts the service that was stopped at the outset.
While the loader was deployed on all victims from this cluster, the second stage (also a loader) was observed on the
computer of only one of the victims and was located in C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\WMI\iiswmi.dll.
The DLL has an export named INIT that contains the main logic and uses the same XOR encryption loop as well as the
same technique to dynamically resolve the Windows API names as seen in the first stage. It loads the following DLL
%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\System\websvc.dll with an argument extracted from the registry key
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\Interface\{6FD0637B-85C6-D3A9-CCE9-65A3F73ADED9}. Unfortunately, the lack of
indicators matching previously known threat actors prevents us from drawing any conclusions or a reasonable hypothesis
as to the group behind these attacks.
Seven victims were flagged by the presence of the first loader and at one of them, the second loader was identified. We
have not currently tied any known threat actor to Websiic. A recent article from GTSC also briefly describes the same
cluster.

Winnti Group
Starting 2021-03-02, a few hours before Microsoft released the patch, the Winnti Group (also known as BARIUM or
APT41) compromised the email servers of an oil company and a construction equipment company both based in East
Asia. This indicates that this APT group also had access to the exploit prior to the patch release.
The attackers started by dropping webshells at the following locations, depending on the victim:
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\caches.aspx
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\shell.aspx
At one of the compromised victims we observed a PlugX RAT sample (also known as Korplug) with C&C domain
mm.portomnail[.]com and back.rooter.tk. Note that mm.portomnail[.]com was previously used by the Winnti Group with
ShadowPad and the Winnti malware. On the same machine, during the same timeframe, we also observed some
malware, not yet fully analyzed, using 139.162.123[.]108 as its C&C address but at the time of writing we don’t know
whether this is related to the Exchange compromise or not.
At the second victim, we observed a loader that is highly similar to previous Winnti v4 malware loaders such as that
mentioned in our white paper on the arsenal of the Winnti Group. Like that Winnti v4 loader, this loader is used to decrypt
an encrypted payload from disk and execute it using the following command:
srv64.exe <Decryption_Key> <Encrypted_Payload_Filename>
where <Decryption_key> is the decryption key used to decrypt the payload stored in <Encrypted_Payload_Filename>.
Once executed, this loader drops a malicious DLL at the following location:

5/11

C:\Windows\system32\oci.dll
This malicious DLL shares multiple similarities with a previous Winnti implant documented by Trend Micro as well as the
Spyder backdoor recently documented by DrWeb and that we have observed being used by the Winnti Group in the past.
The C&C address used by this implant is 161.129.64[.]124:443.
Additionally, we observed various Mimikatz and password dumping tools.
The Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for high-profile supply-chain attacks against the video game
and software industries, leading to the distribution of trojanized software (such as CCleaner, ASUS LiveUpdate and
multiple video games) that is then used to compromise more victims. It is also known for having compromised various
targets in multiple different verticals such as healthcare and education.

Tonto Team
On 2021-03-03, Tonto Team (also known as CactusPete) compromised the email servers of a procurement company and
of a consulting company specialized in software development and cybersecurity, both based in Eastern Europe.
In that case, the attacker used C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\dukybySSSS.aspx for the first-stage webshell.
The attacker then used PowerShell to download their payloads from 77.83.159[.]15. Those payloads consist of a
legitimate and signed Microsoft executable used as a DLL search-order hijacking host and a malicious DLL loaded by
that executable. The malicious DLL is a ShadowPad loader. The C&C address being used by ShadowPad here is
lab.symantecsafe[.]org and the communication protocol is HTTPS.
In addition to ShadowPad, the attacker also made use of a variant of the Bisonal RAT highly similar to a Bisonal variant
that was previously used during Operation Bitter Biscuit attributed to Tonto Team.
On one of the compromised machines, the attacker used an LSAS dumper that was also previously used by Tonto Team.
Tonto Team is an APT group active since at least 2009 and targeting governments and institutions mostly based in
Russia, Japan and Mongolia. For more than ten years, Tonto Team has been using the Bisonal RAT. Tonto Team is one
of the APT groups that now has access to the ShadowPad backdoor.

Unattributed ShadowPad activity
Starting 2021-03-03, we observed the compromise of email servers at a software development company based in East
Asia and a real estate company based in the Middle East where ShadowPad was dropped by the attacker and that we
were not able to conclusively attribute to any known groups at the time of writing.
The attackers used C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\discover.aspx and C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\RedirSuiteServerProxy.aspx as first-stage webshells and dropped ShadowPad
at the following locations:
C:\Windows\Help\mui\0109\mscoree.dll
C:\mscoree.dll
One of the ShadowPad samples uses soft.mssysinfo[.]xyz as its C&C address using the HTTPS protocol while the
second sample uses ns.rtechs[.]org using the DNS protocol, which is less common.
The ShadowPad backdoor is a modular backdoor that was exclusive to the Winnti Group until the end of 2019. To the
best of our knowledge, ShadowPad is now used by at least five additional groups: Tick, Tonto Team, KeyBoy, IceFog and
TA428.

The “Opera” Cobalt Strike
On 2021-03-03 at 04:23 AM UTC, just a few hours after the patch was released, we noticed that another set of malicious
activities had started. At this point we don’t know if these threat actors had access to the exploit beforehand or reverse
engineered the patch. This corresponds to indicators that were published on Twitter and by FireEye, but we haven’t been
able to link this set to any group we are already tracking.
6/11

From 2021-03-03 to 2021-03-05, ESET telemetry shows this activity targeting around 650 servers, mostly in the US,
Germany, the UK and other European countries. Interestingly, this threat actor was consistent in the naming and location
of their first-stage webshell, always using
<Exchange_install_directory>\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\RedirSuiteServerProxy.aspx.
Then on a few selected machines, they executed a PowerShell script, shown in Figure 4, to download additional
components from 86.105.18[.]116. The final payload is Cobalt Strike, which uses the same IP address for its C&C server.
Cobalt Strike is loaded via DLL search-order hijacking against a legitimate Opera executable named opera_browser.exe
(SHA-1: AB5AAA34200A3DD2276A20102AB9D7596FDB9A83) using a DLL named opera_browser.dll (SHA-1:
02886F9DAA13F7D9855855048C54F1D6B1231B0A) that decrypts and loads a shellcode from opera_browser.png
(SHA-1: 2886F9DAA13F7D9855855048C54F1D6B1231B0A). We noticed that 89.34.111[.]11 was also used to distribute
malicious files.

Figure 4. PowerShell script used to download Cobalt Strike

IIS backdoors
Starting 2021-03-03, we observed that on four email servers located in Asia and South America, webshells were used to
install so-called IIS backdoors.
We identified two different malware families:
A modified version of IIS-Raid. It comes from a PoC released on GitHub and documented last year by MDSec.
A variant of Owlproxy, which was documented last year by Cycraft as part of several incidents against Taiwanese
governmental agencies.

Mikroceen
On 2021-03-04, the Mikroceen APT group compromised the Exchange server of a utility company in Central Asia, which
is the region it mainly targets.
Mikroceen operators started by dropping webshells in C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\aspnet_regiis.aspx,
<Exchange_install_directory>\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\aspnet_error.aspx and
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\log_error_9e23efc3.aspx. Then, they downloaded a payload we could not recover from
http://46.30.188[.]60/webengine4.dll. We were not able to tie those first steps to Mikroceen with high confidence, but
these indicators appeared only on the specific server where we saw the Mikroceen backdoors a few hours after.
A few hours later, a Mikroceen RAT was dropped in C:\Users\Public\Downloads\service.exe. Its C&C server is
172.105.18[.]72. Then, this RAT dropped additional tools such as Mimikatz (in C:\users\public\alg.exe), Mimikat_ssp (in
C:\users\public\Dump.exe) and a custom proxy (in c:\Users\Public\calcx.exe). The latter was executed with the following
command line (exposing another attacker-controlled IP address):
calcx.exe 300 194.68.44[.]19 c:\users\public\1.log <private IP>:3128
The Mikroceen APT group (aka Vicious Panda) is a threat actor operating since at least 2017. It mainly targets
governmental institutions and telcos in Central Asia, Russia and Mongolia. It uses a custom backdoor we’ve named
Mikroceen RAT.

7/11

DLTMiner
Starting 2021-03-05 at 02:53 AM UTC, we detected the deployment of PowerShell downloaders on multiple email
servers that were previously targeted using these Exchange vulnerabilities.
The first PowerShell script downloads the next stage at the following address http://p.estonine[.]com/p?e. Previous
articles from 2019 show similarities between this cluster and a cryptominer campaign. More details about the analysis
can be found in Tencent and Carbon Black blogposts. A more recent Twitter post describes the various compromise
steps.
We were unable to find any correlation in terms of webshells deployed on these servers. It is possible that this group is
hijacking webshells previously installed by other threat groups.

Summary
Our ongoing research shows that not only Hafnium has been using the recent RCE vulnerability in Exchange, but that
multiple APTs have access to the exploit, and some even did so prior to the patch release. It is still unclear how the
distribution of the exploit happened, but it is inevitable that more and more threat actors, including ransomware
operators, will have access to it sooner or later.
It is now clearly beyond prime time to patch all Exchange servers as soon as possible (see Microsoft guidance and apply
special care in following the steps in the “About installation of these updates” section). Even those not directly exposed to
the internet should be patched because an attacker with low, or unprivileged, access to your LAN can trivially exploit
these vulnerabilities to raise their privileges while compromising an internal (and probably more sensitive) Exchange
server, and then move laterally from it.
In case of compromise, one should remove webshells, change credentials and investigate for any additional malicious
activity.
Finally, this is a very good reminder that complex applications such as Microsoft Exchange or SharePoint should not be
open to the internet since, in case of mass exploitation, it is very hard, if not impossible, to patch in time.

Webshells
ESET detects the webshells used in these attacks as JS/Exploit.CVE-2021-26855.Webshell.A and JS/Exploit.CVE-202126855.Webshell.B.
The ASPX webshells are typically placed in these folders, using a large variety of filenames:
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\system_web\
