Executive summary
AT&T Alien Labs recently analyzed the Linux version of the Darkside ransomware, one of the
most active ransomware in the last quarter. Shortly after hitting Colonial Pipeline, Darkside
developers announced they would be closing operations.
Key Points:
Unlike common Linux ransomwares which mostly zip files with a password, Darkside
encrypts files using crypto libraries. This likely makes recovery impossible without the
encryption key, if properly implemented.

Background
Linux and UNIX servers have always been a preferred option for servers and data centers,
likely due to the small attack surface of the servers, tight configurations, and lack of user
interaction. However, they are often set up and then forgotten, left without detection or

1/9

protection mechanisms. This makes them very attractive to attackers. By infecting
unprotected virtualization servers, attackers can perform devastating attacks on companies,
taking down all the services of a company with a single infection.
First discovered in August 2020, Darkside is a group that operates ransomware as a service
(RaaS), and attacks by their network of affiliates have infected many companies worldwide.
The most high profile infection happened when a Darkside affiliate hit the network of one of
the major oil pipeline companies in the US, Colonial Pipeline, causing the company to shut
down operations for days. After this attack — likely due to the fact that it drew unwanted
levels of attention to the group globally — the malware authors announced publicly the
closure of their service. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the group has completed a
Linux version of its malware that is targeting ESXi, servers hosting VMware virtual machines.
To this point, the authors announced the Darkside 2.0 version with Linux capabilities on
March 9, 2021 in the XSS Forum:

Analysis
Unlike the Windows version of the malware that targets any Windows endpoint, Darkside
Linux version is mostly targeting ESXi servers. Its default configuration includes the root path
of ESX server machines. Targeted extensions are 'vmdk', 'log', 'vmem', 'vmsn' that are used
in ESX servers for saving virtual machines information, data, and logs.
The malware is quite informative and prints to the screen most of the actions it performs,
which is an uncommon behavior for malware. This could imply that the malware is being
deployed manually. The malware is written in C++ and it’s also using several open-source
libraries that were imported and compiled with the malware code into one binary. Some of
2/9

these libraries are: crypto++ used for encryption, boost used for logging purposes, and
curl used for HTTP requests. The use of these libraries enables the final binary to be a
2.7MB file size. For example, to communicate with an infected machine with its Command
and Control (C&C), the malware uses libcurl functions that were compiled with the rest of the
code.
In addition, the malware supports command line parameters during execution to replace
almost, if not all, of the default configuration variables.

Figure 2. Parameters supported by the malware.
The malware also supports shutting down virtual machines by executing the esxcli
commands, a special console on ESX servers that allows it to interact with virtual machines
from the command line.

Figure 3. Abusing esxcli command.
When executed, the malware prints its configuration to the terminal. This includes the root
path to encrypt, RSA key information, targeted file extensions to encrypt, C2 addresses, and
more, as seen in figure 4.

Figure 4. Darkside configuration.
The C&C addresses are encrypted using a rotated XOR key, which will be decrypted when
the malware is executed. The decrypted addresses can be found in Appendix A:

Figure 6. Malware XOR key.
The malware will then count the files to be encrypted, and it collects information from the
infected machine, sending it to the C&C server after encryption. The exfiltrated information
includes: user name, OS version, hostname, build, and more:

Figure 8 shows an example of the information collected from an infected machine.

Figure 8. Example of collected system information.
The malware will loop through the files to be encrypted and then encrypt them using
ChaCha20 with the RSA 4096 key taken from the configuration. After encryption, the
malware will add a tail at the end of the encrypted file that includes a constant and the cipher,
as seen in figure 9.

After encryption, the malware creates a ransom note in each folder where files were
encrypted.

Recommended actions

6/9

1. Keep software up to date with security updates.
2. Carefully monitor and manage suspicious emails.
3. Use a backup system to backup server files.
4. Install Antivirus and/or endpoint detection and response (EDR) in all endpoints.
5. Make sure two-factor authentication is enabled in all services.

Conclusion
Ransomwares remains one of the biggest threats to companies globally, especially when it
comes to virtual machine servers that may contain multiple machines that are primary targets
for Darkside malware.
Darkside will search files on the main folder of the infected server and encrypt any file that
matches its configuration limits. It will also collect information from the system and send it to
its C&C.
