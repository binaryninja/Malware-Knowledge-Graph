Q1 2019

Trends and forecasts
Positive Technologies keeps monitoring the most important IT security
threats. Experts all over the world are working to combat cybercriminals,
fueling an arms race in which hackers continue to refine their tools. In early
2019, companies in a wide range of industries suffered from cyberattacks.
Summarizing our findings from the first quarter of 2019, we note the following trends:
 The number of unique cyberincidents continued to grow, exceeding the
equivalent year-ago period (Q1 2018) by 11 percent.
 Malware combining multiple types of Trojans is becoming more and more
widespread. Due to its flexible modular architecture, this malware can perform many different functions. For example, it can display advertising and
steal user data at the same time.
 The share of hidden mining keeps decreasing (7% compared to 9% in Q4
2018). Hackers have started to upgrade miners, turning them into multifunctional Trojans. Once inside a system with low computational power on which
mining is uneconomical, such Trojans start acting as spyware and steal data.
 Infections by cryptolockers increased from 9 percent of total incidents in
Q4 2018 to 24 percent in Q1 2019. This malware is often used in combination with phishing, with hackers constantly inventing new ways of deceiving users and making them pay a ransom.
 Healthcare has proved to be a favorite target of cryptolockers. Medical
institutions are more likely to pay a ransom compared to other businesses,
perhaps because of patients' lives and health being at stake.
 Cyberattacks against government are mainly aimed at data theft, with attackers using custom self-developed spyware, or at hacking government
websites in order to infect users with malware.
 Malware remains a serious threat for large industrial companies. When it
comes to such companies, the objective of most attacks is to obtain business secrets. It is possible that ransomware attacks on industry could be
aimed at covering the traces of previous incidents.
 Leaks of millions of user credentials put online services at risk. Attackers
extensively use publicly available data for credential stuffing attacks.
 Injection attacks with malicious JavaScript code (JS sniffers) steal payment
card information and jeopardize the security of users of online stores and
services that support online payments.
We predict growth in the number of attacks in Q2 2019. Malware and social
engineering will remain the favored tools of attackers.
It is no secret that cryptocurrency is in high demand by criminals. However,
mining is becoming increasingly difficult, which is forcing hackers to search for
alternative ways of obtaining cryptocurrency. As a result, the share of ransomware Trojans will remain high so long as there are people willing to pay a ransom.

Statistics
In the first quarter of 2019, we saw a growing number of attacks aimed at
obtaining data. In fact, more than half of attacks were aimed at theft of information. Attackers chase a wide range of data, including personal correspondence and trade secrets. However, the most in-demand information
remains credentials, personal data, and payment card data.

Figure 2. Types of stolen data

The share of targeted attacks fell from 62 percent in Q4 2018 to 47 percent
in Q1 2019. This is caused by an increasing number of attacks affecting more
than one industry—most often, malware campaigns. The share of incidents
affecting individuals remained almost the same (21% compared to 22% in Q4
2018). As for organizations, attackers most often hit government agencies,
medical institutions, industrial companies, banks, and other financial firms.
Later in this report, we will examine these attacks in detail. In addition, Q1
2019 saw a growing number of attacks against online services. We will also
try to explain why hackers are so interested in this particular target.

Attack methods
We will take a closer look at each attack method and indicate which targets
and industries were most affected.

56%

Malware use
Since the beginning of 2019, we have been observing infections by multifunctional Trojans—modular malware capable of combining different types
of functions. For example, the DanaBot Trojan has remote-control components, may function as a banking Trojan, and can also steal passwords of a
number of applications.

Figure 8. Malware types

Phishing remains an effective way of delivering malware. But email is far
from the only channel of malware distribution. For example, users frequently
download files from torrent trackers, on which the risk of malware infection
grows exponentially. Under the guise of a movie, attackers distributed malware used for spoofing addresses of bitcoin and Ethereum wallets when the
information is copied from the clipboard. Users also often download programs from official app stores. Programs with annoying advertising turn out
to be the most common source of malware infection.1, 2 Unfortunately, more
dangerous malware can also be encountered on these stores, such as the
MobSTSPY and Exodus spyware Trojans, as well as the Anubis and Gustuff
banking Trojans. The last one is sold on the darknet under the malware-­as-aservice model for $800 per month.

Q1 2019

Hidden mining is becoming less popular. In early 2018, the share of mining
attacks reached 23 percent, but declined to 9 percent in Q4. In Q1 2019, cryptojacking accounted for only 7 percent of attacks. As mining becomes less
profitable, cybercriminals are forced to upgrade miners by extending their
capabilities to those of multifunctional Trojans. For example, a new Trojan
dubbed CookieMiner not only installs a hidden miner on a victim's computer,
but also steals credentials and payment card information.

36%

Ransomware Trojans, on the contrary, are picking up steam: their share of infections has risen from 9 percent in Q4 2018 to 24 percent in Q1 2019. However,
attackers are now earning less money from "traditional" ransomware. This is
probably due to the educational efforts of cybersecurity experts urging users
not to pay a ransom for file recovery. Be that as it might, attackers keep inventing new ways to manipulate users. CryptoMix hackers promised to donate
ransom payments to a children's charity. Another malicious attack hit users
who for whatever reason were not able to pay ransom in bitcoins. A new version of ransomware offers PayPal as a payment option. If users choose to pay
using PayPal, they are taken to a fake PayPal page. All credentials and payment information entered on the fake page are then stolen by attackers, who
can withdraw money from victims' accounts or sell this data on the darkweb.

Social engineering

Social engineering remains a common method of malware distribution. In
March, the Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT ESC) detected
a mass email campaign distributing a text document regarding upcoming
presidential elections in Ukraine. The document contained a macro which
decoded a PowerShell Empire script hidden in metadata. The script was
used to download malware to the victim's computer.
Besides political events, industry conferences also serve as a subject of
phishing emails sent by attackers. Our experts discovered an invitation for
a scientific conference that contained an exploit for vulnerability CVE-20180802 and remote control malware.
Another phishing trick is to ask victims to verify their account. Hackers sent
messages to the owners of popular Instagram profiles prompting them to
enter personal data and credentials in fake forms, putting all the submitted
data into the hands of the hackers. In yet another example, clients of TD Bank
received emails with the subject line "Confirm account status" pretending
to come from the bank. The emails contained the TrickBot banking Trojan.
In both cases, the malicious messages were sent from email addresses that
closely resembled genuine addresses of the companies.

Figure 10. SMS message

Savvy Internet users know that one or more scrambled letters in an address
can be a warning sign indicating a phishing attack. But what if the domain
matches the legitimate one? Is it absolutely safe to open attachments from
such messages? As practice shows, this is not the case. In brand impersonation attacks, attackers often use compromised resources or vulnerabilities in
mail services to send malicious emails while posing as genuine companies. In
one case, hackers used an insecure SMTP server configuration to distribute
malware and impersonate DHL in a phishing campaign. Messages were sent
from support@dhl.com, which caused recipients to let their guard down.

In another sophisticated phishing attack, hackers used the SingPost name.
The attackers sent a malicious link to users' phones in messages allegedly
coming from the logistics services provider. Hackers managed to send messages grouped in the same conversation history as SingPost's actual ones,
which made users less vigilant, just like in the case of DHL.

Hacking
Attackers exploit known and zero-day vulnerabilities in software for various
purposes. For example, ready-made exploits are often used to deliver hidden
miners to devices. In Q1 2019, hackers used security flaws in the clusters with
outdated Elasticsearch versions (CVE-2014-3120, CVE-2015-1427) and exploited vulnerabilities CVE-2019-6340 in the Drupal CMS and CVE-2019-5736 in
Docker containers. Attackers also seek escalation of privileges on a system,
since administrator rights give them a free hand to conduct malicious actions.
For example, a zero-day vulnerability in the WordPress Easy WP SMTP plugin
allowed attackers to create administrator accounts, modify SMTP options, and
redirect traffic. The flaw may be used to conduct brand impersonation attacks
against companies whose sites have been compromised. We have already
looked into an example of such an attack in the section on social engineering.
In another privilege escalation attack, hackers exploited two zero-day vulnerabilities at the same time—one in Google Chrome and the other in Windows 7.
Google experts discovered the attacks in late February.

Also in February, cybersecurity experts discovered vulnerabilities in WinRAR
that had existed in the program for around 19 years. Such flaws offer hackers
new opportunities for infecting victims with malware. In the first month since
the vulnerability was disclosed, experts have identified about a hundred exploits for the detected vulnerability. WinRAR is an ubiquitous compression
tool used by millions of people as well as major companies, making the vulnerability immensely attractive for hackers. According to experts, the vulnerability threatens 500 million users worldwide. The developers have already
fixed the bugs and released a new version of the software, but the threat
remains relevant as WinRAR does not have an automatic update mechanism.

Web attacks
The beginning of the year was marked by mass attacks by the MageCart
group famous for so-called web skimmers—scripts used to steal payment
card information from websites. We already discussed these attacks in the
Q4 2018 report. In January 2019, experts noted a new surge of MageCart
attacks. The attackers infected 277 e-commerce websites. They managed to
extend their reach by using supply chain attacks, in which a company is compromised in order to attack another one. MageCart hackers injected skimming code into a JavaScript library used by Adverline, an online advertising
company. As a result, websites of the companies that published advertisements via Adverline were in turn infected. The Media Trust experts registered
a similar but larger attack. They discovered a malicious campaign compromising tens of adtech vendors and threatening 49 high-profile websites.
When compromising websites, attackers are motivated by more than just
data theft. A website attack can be an effective way to draw attention to
a problem. Attackers often hit government websites following significant
events that have caused public outcry. After a terrorist attack in Pulwama on
February 14, hundreds of Pakistani websites were hacked.

Sometimes hackers strive to draw public attention to security problems. The
website of Dublin's tram system operator, Luas, was hacked because the
website owners did not reply to a message sent by an anonymous hacker
pointing out security flaws. Developer neglect of security issues likely contributed to an XSS attack targeting users of VK, the popular Russian social
network, in February 2019.
XSS attacks also threaten users of WordPress websites. A vulnerability in the
Abandoned Cart plugin allows attackers to create a backdoor, specifically, an
account with administrator rights. According to experts, the flaw has already
been exploited by attackers at least 5,000 times. A vulnerability in the Social
Warfare plugin allows redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites. And
our company's research shows that XSS attacks are still among the most
common risks threatening web application users.

Credential compromise
One source of hacker income is selling credentials on the darkweb. The more
usernames and passwords hackers steal, the more money they get, which inspires them to conduct mass bruteforcing attacks. Experts observe a growing number of attacks aimed at bruteforcing credentials for Office 365 and
G Suite. Attackers are taking advantage of vulnerabilities in outdated versions of the IMAP protocol to significantly increase the speed of password
bruteforcing.
Traces of credential compromise were also found in an attack against Citrix
that resulted in theft of trade secrets. Experts believe that attackers could
have used so-called "password spraying" for the attack. This method involves
trying the same password or handful of passwords for a whole list of usernames. Unlike traditional bruteforcing, this technique avoids the automatic
lockouts that would otherwise occur after numerous failed login attempts.

In March 2019, the W3C and FIDO Alliance adopted the WebAuthn passwordless login standard. It is hoped that the new technology will make bruteforcing and password spraying a thing of the past. However, implementation
of the standard will take some time.

Q1 2019

The beginning of the year offered unpleasant surprises for government institutions in many countries. A complex but well-planned cyberespionage
campaign, DNSpionage, started at the end of last year and went on the
march in January and February 2019. Cybercriminals stole credentials for
email accounts and other government resources. This classic supply chain
attack managed to compromise the accounts of two major DNS providers.
However, the attackers' ultimate targets were government institutions in the
Middle East. After gaining access to providers' servers, hackers performed a
DNS hijacking attack, altering DNS records and redirecting all mail and VPN
traffic to an attacker-controlled server. The campaign reached such a scale
that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had to issue an emergency
directive outlining security measures to be taken by all federal agencies.

Figure 14. DNS hijacking attack scheme

Early January was also marked by the resurgence of the DarkHydrus APT
group. The group targets government institutions, mainly in the Middle East,
and distributes an updated version of the RogueRobin Trojan (developed by
the group itself). The updated malware version can communicate with the
C2 server via the Google Drive API.
As before, attackers keep hitting high-traffic government websites and infecting them with malware. In one such case, hackers posted links to malicious Word documents with the Godzilla loader on the website of the
Bangladesh embassy in Cairo.
A Pakistani government site was infected by malware. The website in question allows users to apply for a Pakistani passport and track the status of
their application. The Scanbox JavaScript framework collected all the data
submitted by visitors and sent it to criminals.
Q1 2019 also saw a number of ransomware attacks on government institutions.
In most cases, the encrypted files were recovered from backups. However, officials in Jackson County, Georgia, paid $400,000 to restore IT infrastructure.

Healthcare attacks mostly involved malware infection and theft of employee credentials, which remain the two most common attack methods
against medical institutions. For example, email accounts of Verity Medical
Foundation employees were hacked three times within several months.
Healthcare is a favorite target of ransomware attacks for several reasons.
Medical institutions often do not have an adequate information security
budget. Weak protection makes hospitals easy prey for hackers. Moreover,
healthcare facilities store and process huge amounts of personal data, including patients' diagnoses. Hospitals risk substantial fines for losing these
databases, which forces them to pay ransoms more willingly than other businesses. Columbia Surgical Specialists preferred not to risk patients' data and
paid $15,000 for file recovery.

New LockerGoga ransomware is attacking major engineering and industrial
companies. The virus gained public attention in January in an attack against
Altran Technologies, a French engineering consulting firm. Just a month later,
Norwegian aluminum company Norsk Hydro had to halt operations due to
a similar cyberattack. The ransomware victims also included two American
chemical companies. Security experts are actively studying the infamous
malware and have already uncovered a coding error that could be used to
stop the spread of the virus. However, victory is a long way off: to date, experts have identified 31 samples of this rapidly developing ransomware.

The Cobalt group did not give up ground either. In Q1 2019, hackers used the
same technique they applied in late 2018. Just like before, attacks involved
COM-DLL-Dropper loaded with an obfuscated JavaScript backdoor.
In February, PT ESC detected an attack that involved the use of Metasploit in
conjunction with COM-DLL-Dropper. The Metasploit stager is loaded into the
memory of an infected computer from an attacker-controlled server, providing remote access to the device and downloading the necessary Metasploit

modules. A similar attack was conducted in last October and December by
an unknown group—a fact we already covered in our previous report.
A bank cyberattack may lead to infrastructure downtime costing tens and
sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars. In February, Malta's Bank of
Valletta shut down operations as the result of a cyberattack. Hackers tried
to steal €13 million, but the attack was discovered and stopped just in time.

Active Internet users constantly interact with various online services by communicating on social networks, playing games, watching movies, buying
tickets, and booking hotel rooms. However, these services also attract hacker
attention, as they store huge amounts of data, including of a personal nature,
that can bring large profits if sold.
Today, one of the most popular methods of hacking is credential stuffing,
when hackers try to log in to a service with credentials used for other online
services. In January, Reddit announced hacker attempts to obtain unauthorized access to users' accounts, and had to lock down the affected accounts.
According to the Reddit owners, the attackers could have been trying to
make use of large-scale password leaks. Video sharing platform DailyMotion
also fell victim to a credential stuffing attack. But where do hackers get the
databases of credentials needed to conduct such attacks? The darkweb is
one such place. Data for 620 million accounts stolen from 16 hacked major websites, including popular online services, was put on sale on Dream
Market, a darkweb marketplace.
However, attackers can have other objectives as well. VFEmail, an email provider, was completely destroyed in a cyberattack in February 2019. The attackers formatted all disks on every server, as a result of which even backups
were lost. The attack can be explained by high competition on the market
and the struggle for customers.

What companies can do to stay safe
Use proven security solutions:
 Systems for centralized administration of updates and patches. To prioritize update plans correctly, the most pressing security threats must be
taken into account.
 Antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files and the
ability to detect and block threats such as malicious email attachments
before they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus software should simultaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and have the ability
to detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well as block malicious
activity across diverse data streams: email, web traffic, network traffic, file
storage, and web portals. The solution must not only check files in real time,
but also automatically analyze files that have already been checked; this
will allow detecting new threats when signature databases are updated.
 We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and effective response to information security incidents. This will help identify suspicious activity, prevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers' presence,
and enable prompt measures to neutralize threats.
 Use automated software audit tools to identify vulnerabilities.
 Use web application firewalls as a preventive measure to protect websites.
 Implement systems allowing deep network traffic analysis in order to detect advanced persistent threats in real time and in saved traffic. Previously
unnoticed attacks are detected. Monitoring shows network attacks in real
time, including use of malware and hacking tools, exploitation of software
vulnerabilities, and attacks on the domain controller. Such an approach
quickly identifies attackers' presence in infrastructure, minimizes the risk of
loss of critical data and disruption to business systems, and decreases the
financial damage caused by attackers.
 Use specialized anti-DDoS services.

Protect your data:
 Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information where
it can be publicly accessed.
 Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are isolated from the network segments used for day-to-day operations.
 Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.
 Do not use identical username–password combinations for multiple
systems.
 Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged
accounts.

Do not allow weak passwords:
 Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.
 Require password changes every 90 days.
 Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.

20

Keep clients in mind:
 Improve security awareness among clients.
 Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common
attacks.
 Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not
give out such information by email or over the phone.
 Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.
 Inform of security-related events.

Do not allow weak passwords:
 Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.
 Require password changes every 90 days.
 Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.

Monitor and stay current:
 Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.
 Test and educate employees regarding information security.
 Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perimeter. Regularly take an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check
their security, and remediate any vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea
to monitor the news for any new vulnerabilities: this gives a head start in
identifying affected resources and applying necessary patches.
 Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces accessible to an external attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote
management of servers and network equipment.
 Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking
internal infrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.
 Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code
analysis, to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application systems and clients at risk of attack.
 Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources.
Configure servers and network devices to withstand typical attack scenarios (such as TCP/UDP flooding or high numbers of database requests).

How vendors can secure their products
 All of the measures for companies given above, plus:
 Implement a secure development lifecycle (SSDL).
 Regularly audit the security of software and web applications, including
source-code analysis.
 Keep web servers and database software up to date.
 Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.

How users can avoid falling victim
Invest in security:
 Use only licensed software.
 Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.
 Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.

Protect your data:
 Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a
copy on a USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.
 Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.
 Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.

Do not use weak passwords:
 Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters,
numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to
create and securely store passwords.
 Set a different password for each site, email address, or other account that
you use.
 Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every
two to three months.

Be vigilant:
 Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.
 Be careful when visiting sites with invalid certificates. Remember that information entered on these sites could be intercepted by attackers.
 Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.
 Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warning appears.
 Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or
product being advertised.
 Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.

About the research
In this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the most
important and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from our
own expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data from authoritative sources.
Any particular mass incident, such as a phishing campaign using malware, is
considered in this report as a single unique information security threat. Each
event is characterized by the following parameters:
 Attack target is the target of destructive actions by cybercriminals. For
example, if an attack strikes network equipment, servers, or user workstations, the attack target is "infrastructure."
 Attack motive is the ultimate goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results in
theft of payment card information, the motive is "access to information."
 Attack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. An attacker
can perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable network services available for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and get access to resources or
information. For the purposes of this report, this process is referred to as
"hacking." Credential compromise and web attacks are put in separate categories for greater granularity.
 Victim category is the economic sector in which the attacked companies
operate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate). For example, the
"Hospitality and entertainment" category includes companies providing
paid services, such as consulting agencies, hotels, and restaurants. The
"Online services" category includes platforms where users can fulfill their
needs online, for example ticket and hotel aggregator websites, blogs, social networks, chat platforms and other social media resources, video sharing platforms, and online games. Large-scale cyberattacks affecting more
than one industry (most often, malware outbreaks) have been placed in
the "Multiple industries" category.
We believe that in most cases cyberattacks are not made public because
of reputational risks, which makes it hard even for companies involved in
incident investigation and analysis of hacking groups to calculate the precise number of threats. This research was conducted in order to educate
companies and individuals who care about information security on the most
common motives and methods of cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the
main trends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.
