Meet Babar, a New Malware Almost Certainly Created by
France

The NSA, GCHQ, and their allies in the Five Eyes are not the only government agencies
using malware for surveillance. French intelligence is almost certainly hacking its targets too
—and now security researchers believe they have proof.
On Wednesday, the researchers will reveal new details about a powerful piece of malware
known as "Babar," which is capable of eavesdropping on online conversations held via
Skype, MSN and Yahoo messenger, as well as logging keystrokes and monitoring which
websites an infected user has visited.
Babar is "a fully blown espionage tool, built to excessively spy" on its victims, according to
the research, which Motherboard reviewed in advance. The researchers are publishing two
separate but complementary reports that analyze samples of the malware, and all but
confirm that France's spying agency the General Directorate for External Security (DGSE)
was responsible for its creation.
France's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment by the time of
publication.

"European nations are just as capable as the US and Russia to take their espionage efforts
to cyberspace," Marion Marschalek, an Austrian researcher at Cyphort and author of one of
the reports, told Motherboard. "France is just as active as the other big players."

Marschalek analyzed the malware samples with Paul Rascagneres, a malware analyst at
security firm G DATA, and Joan Calvet, a researcher from anti-virus maker ESET.
Initial hints at Babar's existence were first revealed last March, when a document leaked by
Edward Snowden described a 2009 spying operation dubbed SNOWGLOBE. According to
Canadian intelligence agency Communications Security Establishment (CSE), which
discovered the operation, SNOWGLOBE mainly targeted Iran's nuclear program, but also hit
victims in European countries such as Greece and Spain.
The operation used malware the attackers named "Babar," and CSE concluded with
"moderate certainty" that SNOWGLOBE was a hacking operation carried out by "a French
intelligence agency." (The researchers believe this was a previous version of the Babar
malware they have analyzed. The precise capabilities of that old version are unclear.)
After Le Monde published the CSE document describing SNOWGLOBE and Babar, the
researchers said they obtained a series of malware samples, or binaries, that belonged to
the same attackers, and are from the same "family" as the malware described in the
document. Marschalek said that another researcher who preferred not to be named
suggested that copies of the malware had been uploaded to VirusTotal, an online malware
detection service.
Though their analysis didn't uncover any new evidence implicating France, the two reports
confirm many of the details contained within CSE's document, according to the researchers.
"I'm sure [it was France], but proving this publicly is close to impossible," Marschalek told
Motherboard via instant message. "With binary attribution you generally have the problem,
unlike in real crime scenes, you do not have actual evidence. There are indicators, from
which conclusions can be drawn, but anything that serves as something like a digital
fingerprint can be faked in the end."
The first clue is the malware's name. The CSE document identified the malware's "internal
name" as Babar—which happens to be the name of an elephant from a popular series of
French children's books. The sample analyzed by Marschalek and Rascagneres was named
Babar64. Babar also communicated with the same servers as two other hacking tools,
EvilBunny and TFC—which the researchers believe were also created by the French—and
those servers hosted French language websites.
Yet another clue is a simple typo.

According to the CSE document, the author of the Babar malware misspelled a string in the
code. Instead of writing MSIE, the author wrote MSI. That same mistake is contained in the
code of Babar64 and EvilBunny.

All these breadcrumbs are "unique properties" that show that the malware analyzed by
Marschalek, Rascagneres and Calvet is likely associated with the one described in the CSE
document, according to Morgan Marquis-Boire, a former Google security researcher who's
now director of security for First Look Media.
These reports represent "an important step" in understanding the hacking capabilities of
Western nations that are not members of the Five Eyes. While Babar might not be as
sophisticated as the GCHQ malware campaign REGIN, or the newly-revealed NSA
campaign, it's still "high-quality," Marquis-Boire told Motherboard.
"There's different strata of players in the nation-state cyber espionage arena," said MarquisBoire, who has reviewed the report. "There's a lot of really, really badly written malware. Here
there's the quality you could expect from a nation that has a large military industrial
complex."
According to Marschalek, Babar is not "very sophisticated," but is highly targeted and a "very
good software, above the level of what kind of 'products' a malware analyst gets to see on a
daily basis."
In other words, it seems we have evidence that France is in the hacking business now, too.
