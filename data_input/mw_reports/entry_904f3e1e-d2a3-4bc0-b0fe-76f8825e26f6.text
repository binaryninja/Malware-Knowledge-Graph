Note: The tool attempts to identify the file extension of the encrypted files automatically. In
this example, the encrypted files have the *.e392d905 extension. Please make sure that
you have encrypted files on the system you are running the tool.
Step 4: Select “Scan Entire System” if you prefer the tool to search for all encrypted files.
Alternatively, add the path to the location you previously moved the encrypted files.
We strongly recommend that you also select “Backup files” before starting the decryption
process to avoid potential loss or corruption during decryption. Then press “Start Tool”.

At the end of this step, your files should be decrypted.

If you encounter any issues, please contact us at forensics@bitdefender.com.
If you have checked the backup option, you will see both the encrypted and decrypted files.
You can also find a log of the decryption process in the %temp%\BDRemovalTool folder.
To remove the encrypted files left behind, you should search for files matching the
extension and mass-remove them. We do not encourage you to do this until you made sure
that your files can be opened safely and there is no damage to the decrypted files.
