It is widely known that attackers use Windows commands and tools that are
commonly known and used after intruding their target network. Lazarus attack
group, a.k.a. Hidden Cobra, also uses such tools to collect information and spread
the infection. This blog post describes the tools they use.

Lateral movement
These three tools are used for lateral movement. AdFind collects the information
of clients and users from Active Directory. It has been observed that other attack
groups also used the tool [1]. SMBMap is used to have their malware infect other
hosts. (Also check out our previous blog post on Lazarus.) It has also been
observed that Responder-Windows was used to collect information in the network.

Stealing sensitive data
These three tools are used for information theft. Tools for such a purpose are used
only in certain cases because malware itself usually has similar functions. Tools for
collecting account information from browsers and email clients are particularly
used. Attackers often archives collected files in RAR before exfiltration, and so

does Lazarus attack group using WinRAR. As we mentioned in our previous blog
post, the malware can archive files in zlib and send them. It means that files are
not always sent in RAR.

Other tools
These following tools are used for other purposes. Attackers sometimes create
backdoors in the infected network using RDP, TeamViewer, VNC, and other
applications. It is confirmed that Lazarus has used VNC and a common Microsoft
tool ProcDump before. ProcDump is sometimes used when attackers attempt to
extract user credentials from the LSASS process dump. Windows' counterpart of
common Linux tools such as tcpdump and wget are also used.

In closing
This blog post described tools used by Lazarus group. Although their malware
contains many functions as we already covered in other blog posts, they still
supplement it with tools which are widely available and commonly known. It
should be noted that anti-virus software may not detect such tools.
The hash values of the tools covered in this blog post are listed in Appendix A.
