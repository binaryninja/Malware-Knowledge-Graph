Treasury Escalates Sanctions Against the Russian
Government’s Attempts to Influence U.S. Elections
home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126

WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) took sweeping action against 16 entities and 16 individuals who attempted to
influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election at the direction of the leadership of the Russian
Government.
This announcement follows the Intelligence Community’s (IC) “Assessment of Foreign
Threats to the 2020 U.S. Federal Elections.” The IC assessment addresses the intentions
and efforts of key foreign actors, including Russia, to influence or interfere with the U.S.
elections and undermine public confidence in the election process. Russia employed a
system of government officials, disinformation outlets, and companies to covertly influence
U.S. voters and spread misinformation about U.S. political candidates and U.S. election
processes and institutions.
“Treasury will target Russian leaders, officials, intelligence services, and their proxies that
attempt to interfere in the U.S. electoral process or subvert U.S. democracy,” said Secretary
Janet L. Yellen. “This is the start of a new U.S. campaign against Russian malign behavior.”
Today’s actions highlight how multiple Russian officials, proxies, and intelligence agencies
coordinated to interfere with recent U.S. elections. Private and public sector corruption
facilitated by President Vladimir Putin has enriched his network of confidants, who used their
illicit business connections to advance Russia’s campaign to undermine the 2020 U.S.

presidential election—and to give Russia plausible deniability in its disinformation activities.
Members of this network include First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Administration
of Russia Alexei Gromov (Gromov), previously designated as a government official
pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13661. Gromov leads the Kremlin’s use of its media
apparatus that sought to exacerbate tensions in the United States by discrediting the 2020
U.S. election process. As a result, Treasury is designating Gromov pursuant to E.O. 13848
for having attempted to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

TREASURY TARGETS DISINFORMATION OUTLETS CONTROLLED BY
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
Russian Intelligence Services, namely the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Main
Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), play critical roles
in propagating Russian disinformation online. The FSB, GRU, and SVR operate a network of
websites that obscure their Russian origin to appeal to Western audiences. Outlets operated
by Russian Intelligence Services focus on divisive issues in the United States, denigrate U.S.
political candidates, and disseminate false and misleading information. The GRU and FSB
were first designated in 2016.
The FSB directly operates disinformation outlets. SouthFront is an online disinformation site
registered in Russia that receives taskings from the FSB. It attempts to appeal to military
enthusiasts, veterans, and conspiracy theorists, all while going to great lengths to hide its
connections to Russian intelligence. In the aftermath of the 2020 U.S. presidential election,
SouthFront sought to promote perceptions of voter fraud by publishing content alleging that
such activity took place during the 2020 U.S. presidential election cycle.
NewsFront is a Crimea-based disinformation and propaganda outlet that worked with FSB
officers to coordinate a narrative that undermined the credibility of a news website
advocating for human rights. Part of NewsFront’s plan was to utilize Alexander Malkevich,
who is also being re-designated in today’s action, to further disseminate disinformation.
NewsFront was also used to distribute false information about the COVID-19 vaccine, which
further demonstrates the irresponsible and reckless conduct of Russian disinformation sites.
The Strategic Culture Foundation (SCF) is an online journal registered in Russia that is
directed by the SVR and closely affiliated with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SCF is
controlled by the SVR’s Directorate MS (Active Measures) and created false and
unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials involved in the 2020 U.S. presidential
election. It publishes conspiracy theorists, giving them a broader platform to spread
disinformation, while trying to obscure the Russian origins of the journal so that readers may
be more likely to trust the sourcing.
The GRU operates InfoRos. InfoRos calls itself a news agency but is primarily run by the
GRU’s 72nd Main Intelligence Information Center (GRITs). GRITs is a unit within Russia’s
Information Operations Troops, which is identified as Russia’s military force for conducting
2/7

cyber espionage, influence, and offensive cyber operations. InfoRos operates under two
organizations, “InfoRos, OOO” and “IA InfoRos.” InfoRos used a network of websites,
including nominally independent websites, to spread false conspiracy narratives and
disinformation promoted by GRU officials. Denis Tyurin (Tyurin) held a leadership role in
InfoRos and had previously served in the GRU.

Treasury designated SouthFront and the Strategic Culture Foundation pursuant to E.O.
13848 for having engaged in foreign interference in the U.S. 2020 presidential election.
SouthFront was also designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, and E.O. 13382 for
acting on behalf of the FSB. NewsFront was designated pursuant to the Countering
America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), E.O. 13694, and E.O. 13382 for
acting on behalf of the FSB.
Treasury also designated InfoRos, OOO, IA InfoRos, and Tyurin pursuant to CAATSA, E.O.
13694, and E.O. 13382 for acting on behalf of the GRU.
More guidance specific to disinformation and election interference can be found on the
website of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

TREASURY FURTHER TARGETS YEVGENIY PRIGOZHIN’S NETWORK IN
AFRICA
Yevgeniy Prigozhin (Prigozhin) is the Russian financier of the Internet Research Agency
(IRA), the Russian troll farm that OFAC designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 in 2018 for
interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Prigozhin has been designated pursuant to E.O.s
13848, 13694, and 13661.
3/7

Russian national Alexander Malkevich (Malkevich) and his company, the Foundation for
National Values Protection (FZNC), have facilitated Prigozhin’s global influence operations
since at least 2019. Malkevich, who was previously designated in 2018 pursuant to E.O.
13694 for directing USAReally, another designated Prigozhin-financed influence entity, has
continued to support Prigozhin’s disinformation operations. Malkevich runs the FZNC
website. Malkevich utilized the FZNC website along with other Prigozhin operatives to
spread messages on behalf of Prigozhin. Prigozhin has evolved from simply providing
financial support to his global disinformation network to also writing content to denigrate the
U.S. electoral process. Malkevich and the FZNC were designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848,
13694, and 13661 for supporting Prigozhin’s global influence operations. FZNC was also
designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for being owned or controlled by Malkevich.
The Association For Free Research And International Cooperation (AFRIC),
International Anticrisis Center, and Russian nationals Petr Byschkov (Byschkov), Yulia
Afanasyeva (Afanasyeva), and Taras Pribyshin (Pribyshin) facilitate Prigozhin’s malign
operations in Africa and Europe while primarily operating from Russia. AFRIC has served as
a front company for Prigozhin’s influence operations in Africa, including by sponsoring phony
election monitoring missions in Zimbabwe, Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, South Africa, and Mozambique. Despite posing as an African-led initiative, AFRIC
serves to disseminate Russia’s preferred messaging, often related to disinformation. AFRIC
works in coordination with other elements of the Prigozhin network, including FZNC and the
International Anticrisis Center, a fraudulent think tank controlled by Prigozhin’s operatives.
Byschkov manages Prigozhin’s “Africa Back Office,” a team of political consultants tasked
with devising strategies for manipulating African politics in support of Prigozhin’s interests.
Afanasyeva, an employee of the “Africa Back Office,” ran AFRIC and the International
Anticrisis Center. Pribyshin has conducted influence operations in Africa for the IRA in
support of Prigozhin’s objectives in the region since at least 2019.
AFRIC, International Anticrisis Center, Byschkov, Afanasyeva, and Pribyshin were
designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848, 13694, and 13661 for their roles in Prigozhin’s
operations.

TREASURY FURTHER TARGETS YEVGENIY PRIGOZHIN’S ATTEMPTS TO
EVADE SANCTIONS
In addition, Prigozhin uses a complex network of shell and front companies to evade U.S.
sanctions and to obscure his ownership in property. In 2019, two Russia-based companies,
Trans Logistik, OOO (Trans Logistik) and OOO Yunidzhet (Yunidzhet), acted as covert
procurement agents for Prigozhin to obtain aircraft related parts and maintenance. Trans
Logistik obfuscated the ownership of Prigozhin’s blocked property, including the previously
identified aircraft that is blocked property, M-VITO, while Yunidzhet provided management
services to another previously identified aircraft that is blocked property, M-SAAN. Artem

4/7

Stepanov (Stepanov) is the Deputy General Director of Yunidzhet. Maria Zueva is the
General Director of Yunidzhet. Kirill Shcherbakov is Yunidzhet’s ultimate owner and also
owns OOO Alkon, a company with close ties to Yunidzhet.
Trans Logistik and Yunidzhet were designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848, 13694 and 13661
for supporting Prigozhin. Stepanov, Zueva, and Shcherbakov were also designated pursuant
to E.O.s 13848, 13694, and 13661 for acting on behalf of Yunidzhet. OOO Alkon was
designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848, 13694, and 13661 for being owned by Stepanov.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is offering a reward of up to $250,000 for
information leading to the arrest of Prigozhin.

TREASURY TARGETS IRA ENABLER
Pakistan-based Second Eye Solution (SES), also known as Forwarderz, is an organization
that specializes in creating and selling fraudulent identities and has assisted the IRA in
concealing its identity to evade sanctions. Since at least 2012, SES engaged in a scheme to
provide digital photographs of fake documents including passports, driver’s licenses, bank
statements, utility bills, and national identity documents. SES markets these fake documents
for use to verify online accounts including money service business accounts and social
media website accounts. In 2017, the IRA purchased 15 fraudulent U.S. driver licenses
images from SES. The purchased licenses were used as supporting documents for online
social media accounts opened by the IRA.
5/7

Pakistani Nationals Mohsin Raza, Mujtaba Raza, Syed Hasnain, Muhammad Hayat, Syed
Raza, and Shahzad Ahmed are the owners and employees who were instrumental in
processing payment for fraudulent identities. Fresh Air Farm House, Like Wise, and MK
Softtech are four Pakistani front companies used to launder SES profits.
The fraudulent documents produced by SES are likely used at many online services to
evade sanctions and anti-money laundering (AML) screening protocols beyond what OFAC
has been able to identify. SES advertises that their fraudulent documents may be used on
social media, freelancing job postings, and commerce platforms.
As part of today’s listing of SES on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
Persons List (SDN List), OFAC is also identifying digital currency addresses used by SES to
fulfill customer orders in order to help assist financial institutions, and their third-party identity
verification services, in identifying customers on their platforms who have purchased
fraudulent identity documents. Known SES digital currency addresses have received over
$2.5 million in digital currencies over more than 26,900 transactions from 2013 to March
2021.
SES was designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848 and 13694, for acting on behalf of the IRA.
Mohsin Raza, Mujtaba Raza, Seyed Hasnain, Muhammad Hayat, Syed Raza, and Shahzad
Ahmed were designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848 and 13694, for acting for or on behalf of
SES. Fresh Air Farm House, Like Wise, and MK Softtech were designated pursuant to E.O.s
13848 and 13694, for being owned or controlled by Mohsin Raza and Mujtaba Raza.

TREASURY TARGETS KNOWN RUSSIAN AGENT KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK
Konstantin Kilimnik (Kilimnik) is a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant and known
Russian Intelligence Services agent implementing influence operations on their behalf.
During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, Kilimnik provided the Russian
Intelligence Services with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy.
Additionally, Kilimnik sought to promote the narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered
in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2018, Kilimnik was indicted on charges of
obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice regarding unregistered lobbying
work. Kilimnik has also sought to assist designated former President of Ukraine Viktor
Yanukovych. At Yanukovych’s direction, Kilimnik sought to institute a plan that would return
Yanukovych to power in Ukraine.
Kilimnik was designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for having engaged in foreign interference in
the U.S. 2020 presidential election. Kilimnik was also designated pursuant to E.O. 13660 for
acting for or on behalf of Yanukovych. Yanukovych, who is currently hiding in exile in Russia,
was designated in 2014 pursuant to E.O. 13660 for his role in violating Ukrainian
sovereignty.

6/7

The FBI is offering a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to the arrest of
Kilimnik.
