Untangling KNOTWEED: European private-sector offensive
actor using 0-day exploits
microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/07/27/untangling-knotweed-european-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits/
July 27, 2022

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)
found a private-sector offensive actor (PSOA) using multiple Windows and Adobe 0-day exploits,
including one for the recently patched CVE-2022-22047, in limited and targeted attacks against
European and Central American customers. The PSOA, which MSTIC tracks as KNOTWEED,
developed malware called Subzero which was used in these attacks.
This blog details Microsoft’s analysis of the observed KNOTWEED activity and related malware used in
targeted attacks against our customers. This information is shared with our customers and industry
partners to improve detection of these attacks. Customers are encouraged to expedite deployment of
the July 2022 Microsoft security updates to protect their systems against exploits using CVE-202222047. Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint have also implemented
detections against KNOTWEED’s malware and tools.
PSOAs, which Microsoft also refers to as cyber mercenaries, sell hacking tools or services through a
variety of business models. Two common models for this type of actor are access-as-a-service and
hack-for-hire. In access-as-a-service, the actor sells full end-to-end hacking tools that can be used by
the purchaser in operations, with the PSOA not involved in any targeting or running of the operation. In

hack-for-hire, detailed information is provided by the purchaser to the actor, who then runs the targeted
operations. Based on observed attacks and news reports, MSTIC believes that KNOTWEED may blend
these models: they sell the Subzero malware to third parties but have also been observed using
KNOTWEED-associated infrastructure in some attacks, suggesting more direct involvement.

Who is KNOTWEED?
KNOTWEED is an Austria-based PSOA named DSIRF. The DSIRF website [web archive link] says they
provide services “to multinational corporations in the technology, retail, energy and financial sectors”
and that they have “a set of highly sophisticated techniques in gathering and analyzing information.”
They publicly offer several services including “an enhanced due diligence and risk analysis process
through providing a deep understanding of individuals and entities” and “highly sophisticated Red
Teams to challenge your company’s most critical assets.”
However, multiple news reports have linked DSIRF to the development and attempted sale of a
malware toolset called Subzero. MSTIC found the Subzero malware being deployed through a variety
of methods, including 0-day exploits in Windows and Adobe Reader, in 2021 and 2022. As part of our
investigation into the utility of this malware, Microsoft’s communications with a Subzero victim revealed
that they had not commissioned any red teaming or penetration testing, and confirmed that it was
unauthorized, malicious activity. Observed victims to date include law firms, banks, and strategic
consultancies in countries such as Austria, the United Kingdom, and Panama. It’s important to note that
the identification of targets in a country doesn’t necessarily mean that a DSIRF customer resides in the
same country, as international targeting is common.
MSTIC has found multiple links between DSIRF and the exploits and malware used in these attacks.
These include command-and-control infrastructure used by the malware directly linking to DSIRF, a
DSIRF-associated GitHub account being used in one attack, a code signing certificate issued to DSIRF
being used to sign an exploit, and other open-source news reports attributing Subzero to DSIRF.

Observed actor activity
KNOTWEED initial access
MSTIC found KNOTWEED’s Subzero malware deployed in a variety of ways. In the succeeding
sections, the different stages of Subzero are referred to by their Microsoft Defender detection names:
Jumplump for the persistent loader and Corelump for the main malware.
KNOTWEED exploits in 2022
In May 2022, MSTIC found an Adobe Reader remote code execution (RCE) and a 0-day Windows
privilege escalation exploit chain being used in an attack that led to the deployment of Subzero. The
exploits were packaged into a PDF document that was sent to the victim via email. Microsoft was not
able to acquire the PDF or Adobe Reader RCE portion of the exploit chain, but the victim’s Adobe
Reader version was released in January 2022, meaning that the exploit used was either a 1-day exploit
developed between January and May, or a 0-day exploit. Based on KNOTWEED’s extensive use of
other 0-days, we assess with medium confidence that the Adobe Reader RCE is a 0-day exploit. The
Windows exploit was analyzed by MSRC, found to be a 0-day exploit, and then patched in July 2022 as

2/12

CVE-2022-22047. Interestingly, there were indications in the Windows exploit code that it was also
designed to be used from Chromium-based browsers, although we’ve seen no evidence of browserbased attacks.
The CVE-2022-22047 vulnerability is related to an issue with activation context caching in the Client
Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS) on Windows. At a high level, the vulnerability could enable an
attacker to provide a crafted assembly manifest, which would create a malicious activation context in
the activation context cache, for an arbitrary process. This cached context is used the next time the
process spawned.
CVE-2022-22047 was used in KNOTWEED related attacks for privilege escalation. The vulnerability
also provided the ability to escape sandboxes (with some caveats, as discussed below) and achieve
system-level code execution. The exploit chain starts with writing a malicious DLL to disk from the
sandboxed Adobe Reader renderer process. The CVE-2022-22047 exploit was then used to target a
system process by providing an application manifest with an undocumented attribute that specified the
path of the malicious DLL. Then, when the system process next spawned, the attribute in the malicious
activation context was used, the malicious DLL was loaded from the given path, and system-level code
execution was achieved.
It’s important to note that exploiting CVE-2022-22047 requires attackers to be able to write a DLL to
disk. However, in the threat model of sandboxes, such as that of Adobe Reader and Chromium, the
ability to write out files where the attacker cannot control the path isn’t considered dangerous. Hence,
these sandboxes aren’t a barrier to the exploitation of CVE-2022-22047.
KNOTWEED exploits in 2021
In 2021, MSRC received a report of two Windows privilege escalation exploits (CVE-2021-31199 and
CVE-2021-31201) being used in conjunction with an Adobe Reader exploit (CVE-2021-28550), all of
which were patched in June 2021. MSTIC was able to confirm the use of these in an exploit chain used
to deploy Subzero.
We were later able to link the deployment of Subzero to a fourth exploit, one related to a Windows
privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Update Medic Service (CVE-2021-36948), which
allowed an attacker to force the service to load an arbitrary signed DLL. The malicious DLL used in the
attacks was signed by ‘DSIRF GmbH’.

Malicious Excel documents
In addition to the exploit chains, another method of access that led to the deployment of Subzero was
an Excel file masquerading as a real estate document. The file contained a malicious macro that was
obfuscated with large chunks of benign comments from the Kama Sutra, string obfuscation, and use of
Excel 4.0 macros.

Figure 2: Two examples of KNOTWEED Excel macro obfuscation
After de-obfuscating strings at runtime, the VBA macro uses the ExecuteExcel4Macro function to call
native Win32 functions to load shellcode into memory allocated using VirtualAlloc. Each opcode is
individually copied into a newly allocated buffer using memset before CreateThread is called to execute
the shellcode.

Figure 3: Copying opcodes

Figure 4: Calling CreateThread on shellcode
The following section describes the shellcode executed by the macro.

KNOTWEED malware and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
Corelump downloader and loader shellcode
The downloader shellcode is the initial shellcode executed from either the exploit chains or malicious
Excel documents. The shellcode’s purpose is to retrieve the Corelump second-stage malware from the
actor’s command-and-control (C2) server. The downloader shellcode downloads a JPEG image that
contains extra encrypted data appended to the end of the file (past the 0xFF 0xD9 marker that signifies
the end of a JPEG file). The JPEG is then written to the user’s %TEMP% directory.

4/12

Figure 5: One of the images embedded with the

loader shellcode and Corelump
The downloader shellcode searches for a 16-byte marker immediately following the end of JPEG. After
finding the marker, the downloader shellcode RC4 decrypts the loader shellcode using the next 16
bytes as the RC4 key. Finally, the loader shellcode RC4 decrypts the Corelump malware using a
second RC4 key and manually loads it into memory.
Corelump malware
Corelump is the main payload and resides exclusively in memory to evade detection. It contains a
variety of capabilities including keylogging, capturing screenshots, exfiltrating files, running a remote
shell, and running arbitrary plugins downloaded from KNOTWEED’s C2 server.
As part of installation, Corelump makes copies of legitimate Windows DLLs and overwrites sections of
them with malicious code. As part of this process, Corelump also modifies the fields in the PE header to
accommodate the nefarious changes, such as adding new exported functions, disabling Control Flow
Guard, and modifying the image file checksum with a computed value from CheckSumMappedFile.
These trojanized binaries (Jumplump) are dropped to disk in
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\, and COM registry keys are modified for persistence (see
the Behaviors section for more information on COM hijacking).
Jumplump loader
Jumplump is responsible for loading Corelump into memory from the JPEG file in the %TEMP%
directory. If Corelump is not present, Jumplump attempts to download it again from the C2 server. Both
Jumplump and the downloader shellcode are heavily obfuscated to make analysis difficult, with most
instructions being followed by a jmp to another instruction/jmp combination, giving a convoluted control
flow throughout the program.

Mex and PassLib
KNOTWEED was also observed using the bespoke utility tools Mex and PassLib. These tools are
developed by KNOTWEED and bear capabilities that are derived from publicly available sources. Mex,
for example, is a command-line tool containing several red teaming or security plugins copied from
GitHub (listed below):

SharpExec

PassLib is a custom password stealer tool capable of dumping credentials from a variety of sources
including web browsers, email clients, LSASS, LSA secrets, and the Windows credential manager.
Post-compromise actions
In victims where KNOTWEED malware had been used, a variety of post-compromise actions were
observed:
Setting of UseLogonCredential to “1” to enable plaintext credentials:
reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v
UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
Credential dumping via comsvcs.dll:
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump
Attempt to access emails with dumped credentials from a KNOTWEED IP address
Using Curl to download KNOTWEED tooling from public file shares such as vultrobjects[.]com
Running PowerShell scripts directly from a GitHub gist created by an account associated with
DSIRF

6/12

KNOTWEED infrastructure connections to DSIRF
Pivoting off a known command-and-control domain identified by MSTIC, acrobatrelay[.]com, RiskIQ
expanded the view of KNOTWEED’s attack infrastructure. Leveraging unique patterns in the use of SSL
certificates and other network fingerprints specific to the group and associated with that domain, RiskIQ
identified a host of additional IP addresses under the control of KNOTWEED. This infrastructure,
largely hosted by Digital Ocean and Choopa, has been actively serving malware since at least February
of 2020 and continues through the time of this writing.
RiskIQ next utilized passive DNS data to determine which domains those IPs resolved to at the time
they were malicious. This process yielded several domains with direct links to DSIRF, including
demo3[.]dsirf[.]eu (the company’s own website), and several subdomains that appear to have been
used for malware development, including debugmex[.]dsirflabs[.]eu (likely a server used for debugging
malware with the bespoke utility tool Mex) and szstaging[.]dsirflabs[.]eu (likely a server used to stage
Subzero malware).

Detection and prevention
Microsoft will continue to monitor KNOTWEED activity and implement protections for our customers.
The current detections and IOCs detailed below are in place and protecting Microsoft customers across
our security products. Additional advanced hunting queries are also provided below to help
organizations extend their protections and investigations of these attacks.

Behaviors
Corelump drops the Jumplump loader DLLs to C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\. This is a
common directory used by malware as well as some legitimate programs, so writes of PE files to the
folder should be monitored.
Jumplump uses COM hijacking for persistence, modifying COM registry keys to point to the Jumplump
DLL in C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\. Modifications of default system CLSID values should
be monitored to detect this technique (e.g., HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{GUID}\InProcServer32
Default value). The five CLSIDs used by Jumplump are listed below with their original clean values on
Windows 11:
{ddc05a5a-351a-4e06-8eaf-54ec1bc2dcea} = “%SystemRoot%\System32\ApplicationFrame.dll“
{1f486a52-3cb1-48fd-8f50-b8dc300d9f9d} = “%SystemRoot%\system32\propsys.dll“
{4590f811-1d3a-11d0-891f-00aa004b2e24} = “%SystemRoot%\system32\wbem\wbemprox.dll“
{4de225bf-cf59-4cfc-85f7-68b90f185355} = “%SystemRoot%\system32\wbem\wmiprvsd.dll“
{F56F6FDD-AA9D-4618-A949-C1B91AF43B1A} = “%SystemRoot%\System32\Actioncenter.dll“
Many of the post-compromise actions can be detected based on their command lines. Customers
should monitor for possible malicious activity such as PowerShell executing scripts from internet
locations, modification of commonly abused registry keys such as
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest, and LSASS credential dumping
via minidumps.

Recommended customer actions
7/12

The techniques used by the actor and described in the Observed actor activity section can be mitigated
by adopting the security considerations provided below:
All customers should prioritize patching of CVE-2022-22047.
Confirm that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is updated to security intelligence update 1.371.503.0
or later to detect the related indicators.
Use the included indicators of compromise to investigate whether they exist in your environment
and assess for potential intrusion.
Change Excel macro security settings to control which macros run and under what circumstances
when you open a workbook. Customers can also stop malicious XLM or VBA macros by ensuring
runtime macro scanning by Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is on. This feature—enabled by
default—is on if the Group Policy setting for Macro Run Time Scan Scope is set to “Enable for All
Files” or “Enable for Low Trust Files”.
Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate potentially compromised credentials and
ensure that MFA is enforced for all remote connectivity. Note: Microsoft strongly encourages all
customers download and use password-less solutions like Microsoft Authenticator to secure
accounts.
Review all authentication activity for remote access infrastructure, with a particular focus on
accounts configured with single factor authentication, to confirm authenticity and investigate any
anomalous activity.

Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
The following list provides IOCs observed during our investigation. We encourage our customers to
investigate these indicators in their environments and implement detections and protections to identify
past related activity and prevent future attacks against their systems. All sample hashes are available in
VirusTotal.
