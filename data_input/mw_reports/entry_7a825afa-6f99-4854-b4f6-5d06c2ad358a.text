Today, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia unsealed documents
detailing Microsoft’s work to disrupt cybercriminals that were taking advantage of the COVID19 pandemic in an attempt to defraud customers in 62 countries around the world. Our civil
case has resulted in a court order allowing Microsoft to seize control of key domains in the
criminals’ infrastructure so that it can no longer be used to execute cyberattacks.
Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) first observed these criminals in December 2019, when
they deployed a sophisticated, new phishing scheme designed to compromise Microsoft
customer accounts. The criminals attempted to gain access to customer email, contact lists,
sensitive documents and other valuable information. Based on patterns discovered at that
time, Microsoft utilized technical means to block the criminals’ activity and disable the
malicious application used in the attack. Recently, Microsoft observed renewed attempts by
the same criminals, this time using COVID-19-related lures in the phishing emails to target
victims.

This malicious activity is yet another form of business email compromise (BEC) attack, which
has increased in complexity, sophistication and frequency in recent years. According to the
FBI’s 2019 Internet Crime Report, the most-costly complaints received by their Internet
Crime Complaint Center (IC3) involved BEC crimes, with losses of over $1.7 billion,
representing nearly half of all financial losses due to cybercrime. While most of the public’s
attention in recent years has justifiably focused on the malign acts of nation state actors, the
increasing economic harm caused by cybercriminals must also be considered and
confronted by the public and private sectors. For our part, Microsoft and our Digital Crimes
Unit will continue to investigate and disrupt cybercriminals and will seek to work with law
enforcement agencies around the world, whenever possible, to stop these crimes.
These cybercriminals designed the phishing emails to look like they originated from an
employer or other trusted source and frequently targeted business leaders across a variety
of industries, attempting to compromise accounts, steal information and redirect wire
transfers. When the group first began carrying out this scheme, the phishing emails
contained deceptive messages associated with generic business activities. For example, the
malicious link in the email was titled with business terms such as “Q4 Report – Dec19,” as
seen below.

With these recent efforts, however, the phishing emails instead contained messages
regarding COVID-19 as a means to exploit pandemic-related financial concerns and induce
targeted victims to click on malicious links. For example, using terms such as “COVID-19
Bonus,” as seen here.

Once victims clicked on the deceptive links, they were ultimately prompted to grant access
permissions to a malicious web application (web app). Web apps are familiar-looking as they
are widely used in organizations to drive productivity, create efficiencies and increase
security in a distributed network. Unknown to the victim, these malicious web apps were
controlled by the criminals, who, with fraudulently obtained permission, could access the
victim’s Microsoft Office 365 account. This scheme enabled unauthorized access without
explicitly requiring the victims to directly give up their login credentials at a fake website or
similar interface, as they would in a more traditional phishing campaign.
After clicking through the consent prompt for the malicious web app (pictured below), the
victim unwittingly granted criminals permission to access and control the victims’ Office 365
account contents, including email, contacts, notes and material stored in the victims’
OneDrive for Business cloud storage space and corporate SharePoint document
management and storage system.

Microsoft takes many measures to monitor and block malicious web apps based on
telemetry indicating atypical behavior and has continued to enhance our protections based
on this activity. In cases where criminals suddenly and massively scale their activity and
move quickly to adapt their techniques to evade Microsoft’s built-in defensive mechanisms,
additional measures such as the legal action filed in this case are necessary. This unique
civil case against COVID-19-themed BEC attacks has allowed us to proactively disable key
domains that are part of the criminals’ malicious infrastructure, which is a critical step in
protecting our customers.
As we’ve observed, cybercriminals have been adapting their lures to take advantage of
current events, using COVID-19-related themes to deceive victims. While the lures may have
changed, the underlying threats remain, evolve and grow, and it’s more important than ever
to remain vigilant against cyberattacks.
To further protect yourself against phishing campaigns, including BEC, we recommend, first,
that you enable two-factor authentication on all business and personal email accounts.
Second, learn how to spot phishing schemes and protect yourself from them. Third, use
SmartScreen and consider blocking email auto-forwarding to make it harder for

cybercriminals to steal your information. Businesses can learn how to recognize and
remediate these types of attacks and also take these steps to increase the security of their
organizations.
