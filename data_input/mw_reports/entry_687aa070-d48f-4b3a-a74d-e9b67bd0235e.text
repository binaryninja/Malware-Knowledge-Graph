Spamhaus Botnet
Threat Update
Q1 2023
The number of botnet command and control (C&C) servers
continued to escalate in the first quarter of 2023 by +23%.
Across Europe, activity increased, but as per the norm,
the United States, China, and Russia led the way. In addition
to Cobalt Strike and Qakbot contributing to the increase
in numbers, there was a growing popularity in credential
stealers, none more so than that of RecordBreaker, which
experienced a massive 899% surge. Last but not least,
there’s disappointing news relating to active botnet C&Cs
which remain persistent across various networks.
Welcome to the Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q1 2023.

About this report
Spamhaus tracks both Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses and domain names used by
threat actors for hosting botnet command
& control (C&C) servers. This data enables
us to identify associated elements,
including the geolocation of the botnet
C&Cs, the malware associated with
them, the top-level domains used when
registering a domain for a botnet C&C,
the sponsoring registrars and the network
hosting the botnet C&C infrastructure.

This report provides an overview of the
number of botnet C&Cs associated with
these elements, along with a quarterly
comparison. We discuss the trends we
are observing and highlight service
providers struggling to control the number
of botnet operators abusing their services.

Number of botnet C&Cs observed,
Q1 2023
In Q1 2023, Spamhaus identified 8,358 botnet C&Cs
compared to 6,775 in Q4 2022. This was a +23% increase
quarter on quarter. The monthly average increased from
2,258 in Q4 to 2,786 botnet C&Cs per month in Q1 2023.

What are botnet command
& controllers?
A ‘botnet controller,’ ‘botnet C2’ or
‘botnet command & control’ server
is commonly abbreviated to ‘botnet
C&C.’ Fraudsters use these to both
control malware-infected machines
and extract personal and valuable
data from malware-infected victims.
Botnet C&Cs play a vital role
in operations conducted by
cybercriminals who are using
infected machines to send out
spam or ransomware, launch
DDoS attacks, commit e-banking
fraud or click-fraud, or mine
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
Desktop computers and mobile
devices, like smartphones, aren’t
the only machines that can become
infected. There is an increasing
number of devices connected to the
internet, for example, the Internet of
Things (IoT), devices like webcams,
network attached storage (NAS),
and many more items. These are
also at risk of becoming infected.

2 | Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q1–2023

Geolocation of botnet C&Cs,
Q1 2023
The U.S.A., China, and Russia remain the
botnet superpowers
There was no change this quarter in the top three
countries listed. While the U.S.A and China experienced
minimal percentage changes, +8% and -4%, respectively,
Russia witnessed a sizable 62% increase in botnet C&Cs.
However, the award for the most significant growth in
Q4 goes to Switzerland, with a whopping 169% surge.

Increases across Europe
Another quarter – another set of increases across Europe
relating to botnet C&C activity. This quarter, every new
Top 20 entry is based in Europe: Sweden (#17), Austria
(#19), and Lithuania (#20).
Meanwhile, of the countries listed that suffered an uplift in
botnet C&Cs this quarter, over 50% were based in Europe.

Is Saudi Arabia finally improving?
Since Q4 2021, Saudi Arabia has not only been in the Top
20, but in the Top 10 countries for hosting botnet C&Cs…
until Q1 2023. With a -38% decrease, it has finally dropped
out of the Top 10 to #14. Let’s hope this trend continues,
and it drops off the listings entirely.

Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,
Q1 2023
Cobalt Strike and Qakbot remain prevalent
In Q1, Cobalt Strike remained in the #1 spot for a third
quarter. This malware was associated with 160% more
botnet C&Cs than its closest rival, the backdoor
Initial Access Broker, Qakbot.

A surge in credential stealers
The number of botnet C&Cs associated with credential
stealers amounted to only 5.79% of listings in Q4 2022;
however, this quarter, that percentage rose to 22.47%.
One of the key contributors to this increase was
RecordBreaker. This malware experienced a remarkable
899% rise in listings, jettisoning it from #15 in Q4 2022
to #3 in Q1 2023. Evidently, RecordBreaker is benefiting
from the code boost it received in 2022.

Tofsee spambot – a consistent listing
Over the past few years, it’s a rarity for Tofsee not
to appear in the Top 20. This quarter we saw a slight
reduction (-12%) in its number of listings, taking it from
#12 to #18 this quarter.
To discover how to protect against this malware, read the
blog posts recently published by our malware specialists
focusing on two malware vaccines and a network-based
kill switch:
1. Binary file vaccine
2. InMemoryConfig store vaccine
3. Network-based kill switch

FluBot labeling
FluBot continues to decrease (-13%) its activity in 2023;
however, our researchers are still observing it as the
sixth most popular threat associated with botnet C&Cs.
As we’ve mentioned in previous updates, Flubot is using
a “FastFlux” technique to host its botnet C&Cs. The same
botnet infrastructure also serves as C&Cs for other malware
families, such as TeamBot. To make our internal tracking
of this threat easier, we continue to label the associated
infrastructure as “FluBot.”

5 | Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q1–2023

What is Cobalt Strike?
Cobalt Strike is a legitimate
commercial penetration testing tool
that allows an attacker to deploy
an “agent” on a victim’s machine.
Sadly, it is extensively used by
threat actors with malicious intent,
for example, to deploy ransomware.

Most abused top-level domains,
Q1 2023
Freenom’s troubles equate to a positive change
At the end of last year, we reported that some of the
Freenom TLDs (.ga & .ml) were experiencing significant
reductions in the number of associated botnet C&C
registrations. This quarter all of Freenom’s TLDs
(.cf, .ga, .gq, .ml, .tk) have dropped out of the Top 20.
We’d love to say that’s because they started to take abuse
on their TLDs seriously, but given their history, we know
that’s extremely unlikely. Instead, the truth lies in the legal
actions taken by a social giant…
In March of this year, Freenom was sued by Meta, alleging
cybersquatting violations and trademark infringement,
and for some time, the registry hasn’t been accepting
new domain registrations.
As we have always stated, botnet operators look for the
path of least resistance – where infrastructure is cheap,
or ideally free, and registration processes devoid of
verification. We’re delighted to see these TLDs dropping
off our rankings.
The question is, “Who are those miscreants now turning
to for botnet C&C domain registrations?”

Unbelievable increases
Both .us, the ccTLD run by Registry Services LLC, and .me,
the one-time ccTLD now run as a gTLD by DoMEn d.o.o,
have experienced some of the highest percentage increases
quarter-on-quarter that we’ve witnessed since we began
compiling the Botnet Update. In Q1 2023, .us experienced
a +1,569% increase, and .me a +1,497% increase!!!
Is this just a coincidence that following Freenom’s
“freeze” on new domain registrations, we see other
registries experience unprecedented increases in domains
associated with botnet C&Cs?
We urge both registries to review their registration
processes and that of their affiliated registrars.

8 | Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q1–2023

Top-level domains (TLDs)
a brief overview
There are a couple of different
top-level domains (TLDs) including:
Generic TLDs (gTLDs) - these are
under ICANN jurisdiction. Some
TLDs are open i.e. can be used by
anyone e.g., .com, some have strict
policies regulating who and how
they can be used e.g., .bank, and
some are closed e.g., .honda.
Country code TLDs (ccTLDs) typically these relate to a country
or region. Registries define the
policies relating to these TLDs;
some allow registrations from
anywhere, some require local
presence, and some license their
namespace wholesale to others.

Most abused top-level domains,
Q1 2023 (continued)
Interpreting the data
Registries with a greater number of active domains
have greater exposure to abuse. For example, in Q1
2023, .net had more than 13m domains, of which 0.001%
were associated with botnet C&Cs. Meanwhile, .us had
approximately 220k domains, of which 0.393% were
associated with botnet C&Cs. Both are in the top ten
of our listings. Still, one had a much higher percentage
of domains related to botnet C&Cs than the other.

Working together with the industry for
a safer internet
Naturally, we prefer no TLDs to have botnet C&Cs
linked with them, but we live in the real world and
understand there will always be abuse.
What is crucial is that abuse is dealt with quickly.
Where necessary, if domain names are registered
solely for distributing malware or hosting botnet C&Cs,
we would like registries to suspend these domain names.
We greatly appreciate the efforts of many registries
who work with us to ensure these actions are taken.

Most abused domain registrars,
Q1 2023
NameSilo is back in pole position
After briefly being knocked off its top spot at the end
of last year by Tucows, NameSilo is back to its #1 position
(sadly). In Q1, it saw a 409% growth in the number
of fraudulent domain registrations for botnet C&Cs,
compared to the previous quarter.
We guess that the only good news for NameSilo in
this data is the fact that its percentage increase was
surpassed by three other registrars: West263 (1448%),
Google (723%) and Hostinger (411%).

Nice work Tucows
As touched on above, Tucows had a dreadful time
regarding the number of botnet C&C registrations at the
end of last year, with 597 in Q4 2022. We’re delighted
to report that at the end of Q1 2023, these numbers had
reduced by 75% taking them to 149, dropping them down
the Top 20 from #1 to #11.
Keep on slashing those numbers Tucows.

Networks hosting the most newly
observed botnet C&Cs, Q1 2023
Does this list reflect how quickly networks deal
with abuse?
While this Top 20 listing illustrates that there may be
an issue with customer vetting processes at the named
network, it doesn’t reflect on the speed that abuse desks
deal with reported problems. See the next section in this
report, “Networks hosting the most active botnet C&Cs”,
to view networks where abuse isn’t dealt with promptly.

No sooner do they leave than they return
Unfortunately, having departed from the Top 20 in
Q4 2022, m247.com (alternatively known as m247.ro)
and colocrossing.com have returned to #12 and
#20, respectively.

Networks and botnet
C&C operators
Networks have a reasonable
amount of control over operators
who fraudulently sign-up for
a new service.
A robust customer verification/
vetting process should occur
before commissioning a service.
Where networks have a high
number of listings, it highlights
one of the following issues:
1. Networks are not following
best practices for customer
verification processes.
2. Networks are not ensuring that
ALL their resellers follow sound
customer verification practices.
In some of the worst-case
scenarios, employees or owners
of networks are directly benefiting
from fraudulent sign-ups, i.e.,
knowingly taking money from
miscreants in return for hosting their
botnet C&Cs; however, thankfully,
this doesn’t often happen.

Networks hosting the most active
botnet C&Cs, Q1 2023
Finally, let’s review the networks that hosted the most
significant number of active botnet C&Cs at the end of
Q1 2023. Hosting providers in this ranking either have an
abuse problem, do not take the appropriate action when
receiving abuse reports, or omit to notify us when they
have dealt with an abuse problem.

New entries

Let’s start with the good news

Departures

We want to congratulate all those operators who
have addressed those botnet C&C servers that
have been persistent on their networks; baidu.com,
comcast.net, google.com, huawei.com, ipserver.com,
and skybroadband.com. Excellent work!

baidu.com, comcast.net, google.com,
huawei.com, ispserver.com,
skbroadband.com.

But what is going on elsewhere in the industry?
At the end of last year, we announced how impressed
we were with the majority of network operators who
were cleaning up their operations of active botnet C&Cs.
This was particularly notable given that this period
included Black Friday and the Holiday Season - notorious
times for online abuse.
BUT, in the first quarter of this year - except for
tencent.com, which decreased the number of botnet
C&Cs it hosted by -12% - every previously listed network
has experienced increases. In fact, 7 out of the 13
operators we’re referring to doubled, and one tripled,
the number of active botnet controllers on their networks.

What has happened?
Did your abuse teams not come back from their vacation,
or considering the current economic climate, are cuts
being made to these teams? Alternatively, in the scramble
for a quick buck, are verification methods at the sales end
of the process being relaxed, allowing the dross to swarm
in? Although, if the latter were the case, we would expect
significant increases in newly observed botnet C&Cs.
We’d like to hear from you.
We’d like to understand the challenges of dealing
with this abuse:
