On August 15th 2018 this blog revealed a connection between APT10 and the Tianjin bureau
of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). But the story doesn’t stop with that
revelation; analysts working with this blog have continued to investigate every lead provided
to us. One such lead has helped us to identify another individual in China connected to
APT10. The trail starts with a domain name first published in FireEye’s Poison Ivy Report as
a MenuPass (APT10) affiliated domain.
chromeenter[.]com
The domain chromeenter[.]com appears in the FireEye report as a domain associated with
the MenuPass malware.

and subdomains also appeared in early versions of Annex A (Indicators of Compromise) of
the PwC Operation Cloud Hopper report and it is listed on Alien Vault as a sink-holed
domain.

Technology Co Ltd
Domain registration information for chromeenter[.]com shows that it was registered in April
2010 to Hogate Technology Co Limited. Although much of the registration information
remained the same when the domain was updated in April 2012, the registrant company was
changed to Tianjin Tiaoyiye Technology Co Limited and the registration e-mail address was
updated to gbaike[at]gmail.com. The domain became WHOIS protected in late June 2013
just prior to being repossessed by GoDaddy and named in the FireEye report.
gbaike[at]gmail.com
The registration e-mail address used from 2012 leads to a number of other domains, many of
which are connected to Tianjin, China, the home of APT10. Domains registered by
gbaike[at]gmail.com include:
jiaxiaotuangou[.]com
shgongxingbc[.]com
tjguge[.]com

The domain jiaxiaotuangou[.]com was registered to an individual named An Zhiqiang and
was also associated with the Tianjin Tiaoyiye Technology Development Co Ltd (天津天骄易业
科技发展有限公司) in registration data. Chinese characters for the company were identified
at hhlyny.com and give a slightly different name of Tianjin Tianjiaoyiye Technology
Development Co Ltd.

related to the company including a link to the company website at tjwangdian[.]com.

The Zhaopin entry also provides a summary of the business activities of the company that
translates roughly as:

Chinese characters for An Zhiqiang (安志强).

Armed with a name (安志强), a handle (gbaike), a location (Tianjin) and a company (天津天
骄易业科技发展有限公司) a number of new sources of material on the individual can be
discovered, including Twitter account @gbaike. The account is in the name 安志强, bears the
handle @gbaike and has its location set as Tianjin. The account also refers to marketing in
its profile image – this matches the description of the company from Zhaopin.

The final link to a specific individual in Tianjin
comes from the domain web1680[.]com which
was identified above as registered by
gbaike[at]gmail.com. The website’s contact us
page contains the phone number 15102292183.
This same phone number is listed on a different
website, tjmeta[.]com that lists An Zhiqiang (安
志强) as an instructor in internet marketing with
a specialism in WeChat marketing.
The bullet points on the right hand side of the
screenshot from tjmeta[.]com match those used
in @gbaike’s Twitter cover image above.
The photo appears to be that of a well known web marketing expert from Tianjin, China.
In summary, An Zhiqiang (安志强) and company Tianjin Tianjiaoyiye Technology Co
Ltd (天津天骄易业科技发展有限公司) are both connected to APT10 activity through
domains used for APT10 / MenuPass activity prior to FireEye’s 2013 Poison Ivy report.
