The updated Grandoreiro Malware equipped with latenbot-C2 features in Q2 2020 now
extended to Portuguese banks.
Grandoreiro is a Latin American banking trojan targeting Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Peru, and
has now extended to Portugal.
Cybercriminals attempt to compromise computers to generate revenue by exfiltrating
information from victims‚Äô devices, typically banking-related information. During April and May
2020, a new Grandoreiro variant was identified. This piece of malware includes
improvements in the way it is operating. The threat has been disseminating via malscam
campaigns, as in the past, and the name of the victim is used as a part of the malicious
attachment name, as shown below.

The attached file is an HTML document that downloads the Grandoreiro‚Äôs 1st stage ‚Äì a
VBScript file (VBS). After that, an ISO file is downloaded from the online server, according to
the target country and campaign. During this investigation, several samples were found
1/24

online, specifically grouped by campaigns and countries (see Technical Analysis).
The malware modus operandi is very similar to old samples, however, this new variant brings
some improvements to how it is communicating with the C2 server. After analyzing it,
similarities with latenbot-C2 traffic were identified and described below (another Brazilian
trojan).
Grandoreiro operators probably are including Latenbot botnet modules as a way of improving
communication between C2 and infected hosts ‚Äì creating a kind of Grandoreiro botnet.
The malware is capable of collecting banking details from victims‚Äô devices, get total control of
the OS, reboot, and lockdown, windows overlay, keylogger capabilities, and performing
browser interaction.
For more details about this threat see the Technical Analysis below.

Technical Analysis
The Grandoreiro malware has been distributed via malscan campaigns around the globe
during Q2 2020. As can be observed during this publication, new features have been added
to the new samples, including latenbot-C2 features (another Brazilian trojan ‚Äì see
@hasherezade analysis here), and the scope of malware was now extended to Portuguese
banks.

As observed below, after submitting the sample into VirusTotal it was classified as a
variant of Grandoreiro trojan, as some changes were performed by crooks to improve this
piece of malware.

Figure 2: Grandoreiro variant VT sample submitted on 2020-04-24 during this investigation.
This specific sample was distributed via a VBScript file, one of the different chains of
Grandoreiro as detailed by ESET.

show different paths the chain may take). The final ZIP archive may be encrypted and in
some cases also protected by a password ‚Äì credits ESET.
The malware has been distributed during April and May 2020 and has affected Portuguese
users. One of the last analyzed samples (2020-05-21 ‚Äì
8491a619dc6e182437bd4482d6e97e3a) is scrutinized below.

Grandoreiro VBS file ‚Äì First stage (Portugal May 2020)

SHA1: 46d601a56103bf0a623d1c937eab41d8772de644
At first glance, the VBS file seems obfuscated, nonetheless, some details can be extracted
such as the encoded string with the URL where the next stage is downloaded and the place
where it will be executed on the target machine.

Figure 4: Grandoreiro VBS file (1st stage) obfuscated. Some details can be extracted from
the code how highlighted above.
The following piece of code can be used to decode the strings hardcoded in the VBS file.
The decoded string is a URL pointing to a website where several samples of Grandoreiro are
available. The samples are downloaded depending on the initial stage and the target country.
The following URL was distributed in Portugal during April and May 2020 and described in
this investigation.
Encoded string: cipher="bnnj4))+3,(,-0(+.1(+**4+3/*)Cho`nolcifm(cmi"
-Decoded string: http://192.236.147.]100:1950/Inufturiols.iso

5/24

The Grandoreiro samples available on this server online were often changed by criminals as
a way of bypassing AV‚Äôs detections. Based on metrics from May 20th, 1771 users were
potentially infected or executed the Grandoreiro 1st stage (VBS file).

Figure 5: Metrics collected from the Grandoreiro server on May 20th, 2020. Each sample is
associated with different ongoing campaigns and target countries.
In detail, the sample distributed in Portugal was downloaded 224 times (Inufturiols.iso in
Figure 5). The sample was available for download between 2020-05-18 and 2020-05-22.
An interesting point is that one day after data collection, on 2020/05/21, most of the samples
were removed from the server by the malware operators, but the sample targeting Portugal
was kept available for the next days.

6/24

Figure 6: Metrics collected from the server on May 21st, 2020 with the Portuguese sample
kept by crooks.
The threats available on the server are the same, but different samples were created by
Grandoreiro operators as observed below. The samples were grouped by countries or
campaigns.

Figure 7: Grandoreiro samples (ISO files) available on the server online.
The ISO files have a size range of 4MB to 7MB which is an unusual file size for image files.
Theses files are an archive file that contains all the information that would be written to an
optical disc. The malware is inside them and is dropped when the file is executed. This is not
new, several threats have been distributed via ISO files past months (see more details in a
ThreatPost publication here).

7/24

Digging into the details, when the VBS file (1st stage) is executed on the victim‚Äôs machine,
the ISO file is downloaded from the server online.

Figure 8: ISO file downloaded from the server online and stored on the IE web cache.
Next, the folder ‚Äú \nvreadmm ‚Äù is created on the AppData\Roaming directory, and the zip
file with the malware inside is dropped (the zip filename can be observed in Figure 4 above).

8/24

Figure 9: Zip file with the malware inside is dropped into the
‚ÄúAppData\Roaming\nvreadmm‚Äù folder.
When the download is done, the unzip process starts. The PE file (Grandoreiro trojan
malware) is extracted into the same folder and executed.

Figure 10: Grandoreiro extracting process ~ binary with a size of 331 MB.

Grandoreiro ‚Äì Final Payload (Portugal May 2020)
Filename: Inufturiols.exe
MD5: 1f861de0794cd020072150db618da154
SHA1: c3f70025857ac7eca467412d35f17fc5ec10f659
The final payload is a PE file written in Delphi ‚Äì a Latin American banking trojan. According
to ESET, ‚ÄúGrandoreiro has been active at least since 2017 targeting Brazil and Peru,
expanding to Mexico and Spain in 2019. ‚Äú
The malware scope was extended also to Portugal now, with several Portuguese banks
included in the malware operations as highlighted below.

As already documented by ESET, the malware has a set of capabilities:
manipulating windows
updating itself
capturing keystrokes
simulating mouse and keyboard actions
navigating the victim‚Äôs browser to a chosen URL
logging the victim out or restarting the machine
blocking access to chosen websites
In detail, the malware performs its tasks according to the OS installed on the infected device
( label 1 ‚Äì Figure 12 ). Several Windows OS target versions can be found inside the
malware, namely:
Windows 10 Home
Windows 8
Windows 10
Windows Server

13/24

Figure 12: Grandoreiro blocks of code executed during the infection process. All the
highlighted labels are described below.

14/24

Label 2 shows a call that examines the affected device and creates a folder inside
\AppData\Roaming where new modules can be downloaded into and also some data about
the target bank portal can be temporarily stored.

Figure 13: The malware uses some in-memory paths that will be created when the target
banking portal and victims‚Äô details are collected.
Label 3 in Figure 12 shows when the process of collecting details and browser overlay is
initiated. ‚ÄúDetonarProcesso‚Äù Portuguese word can be translated to: ‚ÄúTrigger process‚Äù, in
English. The malware starts here its process of collecting details about the banking portal
when the victim accesses a target banking website.

15/24

In addition, label 4 and label 5 are the calls responsible for creating the overlay window
that will be presented on the victims‚Äô screen.
Finally, label 6 shows that the overlay windows is presented based on the target banking
organization.
During its execution, Grandoreiro collects some details about the infected device:
computer name and username
operating system; and
list of installed security products.
SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct

Interesting that the malware is not executed when two computer names are found. They
probably are the computer names from Grandoreiro operators/developers. This is can be
seen as a potential kill switch.

Figure 14: Computer names hardcoded inside the malware.

Grandoreiro capabilities and Latenbot-C2 features
16/24

Grandoreiro is a piece of malware that has evolved over time. It has capabilities to interact
with the infected machine, receiving commands from C2, and executes them inside the
machine as a simple botnet.
As described by ESET on older variants; and confirmed during this analysis; the malware is
capable of:
manipulating windows
updating itself
capturing keystrokes
simulating mouse and keyboard actions
navigating the victim‚Äôs browser to a chosen URL
logging the victim out or restarting the machine; and
blocking access to chosen websites

Figure 14: Grandoreiro internal commands (left side) and browser management (right side).
The malware persistence is achieved via a registry key on Windows\CurrentVersion:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Value: C:\Users\root\AppData\Roaming\nvreadmm\Inufturiols.exe

An interesting detail in this variant is the C2 communication. The C2 IP address can be
identified below, where also the name ‚ÄúDANILO‚Äù is visible.

17/24

Figure 15: Grandoreiro C2 IP address.
Inside the malware and based on the web traffic analysis, it‚Äôs possible to see similarities with
latenbot C2-traffic (as presented here).

Figure 16: Latenbot (2017) and Grandoreiro (2020) C2-traffic similarities.
Grandoreiro operators probably are including Latenbot botnet modules as a way of
improving communication between C2 and infected hosts ‚Äì the creation of a kind of
Grandoreiro botnet.

18/24

Figure 17: Grandoreiro C2-traffic.

Grandoreiro PE file padding
As observed in ESET analysis, ‚Äúthe vast majority of Grandoreiro samples utilize a very
interesting application of the binary padding technique. This technique is all about making
the binaries large and we have seen it being used even by more sophisticated malware. We
have also observed some other Latin American banking trojans employing it occasionally,
but only in the simplest form of appending a large amount of junk at the end of the binary.
Grandoreiro chooses a different approach ‚Äì a simple, yet very effective one. The resources
section of the PE file is augmented by (usually 3) grande BMP images, making each binary
at least 300 MB in size.‚Äù
The samples analyzed in May 2020 that target Portuguese users used the technique
previously described.
Figure 18 below shows that the resources directory is big and populates part of the binary
size.

19/24

Figure 18: PortEx padding analysis ‚Äì Grandoreiro May 2020.
Three BMP images were specially created by Grandoreiro operators as a way of enlarging
the size of binary file. Notice that the PE file size is 331 MB and 322 MB are only populated
by three BMP resources (the technique used by malware operators in past samples).

20/24

Figure 19: BMP resources used by Grandoreiro malware to increase file size and to bypass
AV‚Äôs detection.

Spam tool
During May 2020 was observed that many phishing emails targeting Portuguese users were
disseminated via a spam tool called: Leaf PHPMailer 2.8. Crooks compromise several
servers and are using tools like this to sent malicious emails to a large group of users.
Below is presented a screenshot from a compromised server we analyzed during this
investigation.

21/24

Finally, the malware server online with the ISO files, spam tool, and C2 were
decommissioned at the moment of writing this publication.
