Multi-Staged JSOutProx RAT Targets
Indian Co-Operative Banks and Finance Companies

Executive Summary
Since early 2021, Quick Heal Security Labs has been monitoring various attack
campaigns using JSOutProx malware, which is a highly obfuscated & complex
JavaScript JavaScript-based RAT. Most of these attacks are targeted against
different small and medium businesses in the Banking and Financial sectors. Similar
campaigns related to this malware have also been previously reported from other
countries. But, these attacks which are targeting Indian companies are being
operated from separate C2 servers. We have previously published a blog in October
2021 that emphasized malware and its different stages.
In this paper, we will go a little deeper into the different versions of the malware and
how it targets Indian companies.

Initial Access:

(Fig.1 - Phishing Email)
The Initial Infection starts with an email which brings in a malicious compressed
archive containing a JavaScript file. This file is the actual JsOutProx payload.
We have analyzed multiple .eml files from this campaign. Most of them had either:
• Header with a spoofed email of the sender or
JavaScript
• Were compromised to make it look more legitimate and convincing to the
victim.
This is a general tactic used by attackers in spam campaigns.

(Fig 2. ZoomEye record about IMAP Server)

In 2020, an Attacker used IMAP belonging to “192.188.88.116” to send bulk spam
emails to its targets.
JSOutProx is a highly obfuscated, complex JavaScript based RAT. We have been
monitoring this attack campaign since December 2019 and finding its activity even
today.
• This JavaScript code is approximately 1 MB in size.
• Looking into the code, there is a variable with a long array of around 28k values in it.
• This occupies almost a quarter of the file size.
• This array consists of base64 kind of data, but on decryption, we get junk.

JavaScript

(Fig 3.)
The data is de-obfuscated by passing in the form of function (z, w) [e.g.: HJ('0x61fe',
Z8L5') ] where z refers to the index of the value in “H array” and w refers to RC4
decryption key.
The actual decoding function is hidden in variable r. The data is base64 decoded
and RC4 decrypted at the time of execution.

(Fig 4.)

(Fig 5.)
This RAT can be run as a JavaScript file on the command line, or as a .HTA file inside
a window (mshta.exe). If it is running from inside a window, the RAT hides the
window by resizing it to 0*0 pixels (height*width). Apart from that, it also moves it
away from the viewable part of the screen.
JavaScript

(Fig 6.)
Moving forward, there is a HT object being initialized

(Fig 7.)
Setting the breakpoint and adding a watch to HT we can clearly see how it got
de-obfuscated.

(Fig 11.)
Let’s now focus on what is all this. Ht object basically has a configuration for the
malware. A few interesting fields in the configuration include (fig below):
• The "BaseUrl" field points to the C2 domain and port number via the HTTP
protocol. “Hxxp[:]//gensamogh.myq-see.com:9059/” (source)
• While downloading plugins and assemblies from C2, the "Password" field is
used. “"vruxcvdfmopd123"”
"macxr". Initially, it was JSOutprox.
• ”Tag” field contains a campaign ID.
JavaScript
• “Startdate” is about the starting date of infection. “Mon Dec 13 16:22:14
UTC+0530 2021”
• Delimiter is used as a separator by the malware while exfiltrating data. "_|_"
“ViewOnly” allows the attacker to monitor the victim to gather victim info
and not write or execute anything on the machine.
• Fs: Uses Scripting File system Object to gain read/write privileges
• Wsh: Uses Wscript. Shell Object to execute Wscript files
• Sh: It uses Shell.Application object to execute command line applications
• InstallDir : Contains the location for installation of malware
• Sleeptime: Delaying the execution of malware
• IDPrefix: This is used as a prefix when data is sent over C2
• ProxyActions: Indicates if malware is a proxy for any other process

(Fig 12.)
How is the configuration varying in different versions?
The configuration is almost the same in all versions, with few changes.
1. Base URL changes in different versions. Given below are the C2 found among
all the versions.
• marcelbosgath.zapto.org:9790

• dirrcharlirastrup.gotdns.ch:8037

• ruppamoda.zapto.org:9099

Plugins

Plugins:
This malware has various plugins to perform various operations such as
exfiltration of data, performing file system operations etc. Apart from that, it also
has various methods with offensive capabilities that perform various operations.
Methods:
A few interesting methods (can be seen in Fig 10 and Fig 11) are:
1. getUuid : Gets the UUID of the machine
remove Startup: Remove startup entries(persistence mechanism) if any
2. userName :Get the username of the victim's machines
Process(list): To list down all the processes which are running
3. receive: interpret commands received from C2. These commands are written in
the form of a switch case. Given below are a few commands:
• fnm: Sends the scriptfullname to C2.
• dvo: set to View only
• pat: Update the implant

• lgf: disconnect
• ejs: evaluate a javascript code
• evb: evaluate a VBscript code
• uss.s: Set proxy actions and update sleep time • uis: unInstall
• upd: Update and restart the implant
• ins: install
• rst: Restart
• rins: reset the persistence mechanism
• rmz: Set the zoneidentifier
• ruis: remove the persistence
• l32: open launch ScriptFullName
• sins: open addStartup
• l64: open launch scriptFullName
• suis: open removeStartup
• dcn: exit
• int.g: send C2 sleepTime
• rbt: reboot the victim’s machine
• int.s: set sleepTime ,
• shd: shutdown the victim's machine
• sdn: Load a .NET dll(in new versions)

(Fig 13.)
Then there is an if-else loop related to plugins. These plugins are used to maintain
the implant easily:
• fi: FilePlugin
• do: DownloadPlugin
• sp: ScreenPShellPlugin
• cn: ShellPlugin
• in: InvokePlugin

• sh: ShortcutPlugin
• as: AssociationPlugin
• jv: JavaInstallPlugin
• pr: ProcessPlugin.

(Fig 14.)

How does this implant work?
After creating RAT configuration, the first function run by the implant is “init”.

(Fig 15.)
This will create an identification string for the victim machine where it gathers
system information and stores them into the HT[‘ID’] variable. This ID is filled up
with:
• VolumeSerial
• UUID
• Computername
• Username

• OSVersion
• OSCaption
• tag
• ScriptName

And it is separated by Delimiter.
This implant then moves in an endless loop in which it calls the above “receive”
function every 5 seconds. This function basically allows the attacker to
communicate and coordinate with the malware.
The malware connects to the C2 and fetches a string indicating the command to
be executed into the “l[0x0]” variable. This l[0x0] variable can contain either
commands or plugins, which are discussed above.
Let’s now look at plugins of older versions:
1. InfoPlugin: Infoplugin is used along with a function receiver that is used to
interpret commands from C2. Basically this plugin is used to collect and send
victim machine info to C2.

(Fig 16.)

2. File plugin: Perform all file system operations.
• fi.del: Open File removeEx
• fi.cp: Open File copyEx
• fi.mv: Open File moveEx

• fi.nd: Open File createFolderEx
• fi.ren: Open File rename
• fi.e: Execute a file through Wsh etc..

(Fig 17.)
3. ProcessPlugin: This plugin collects processing information. It also creates or
terminates a process by calling the process-related functions.

(Fig 18.)
4. ScreenPShellPlugin: Perform mouse and keyboard operations using
PowerShell scripts.

(Fig 19.)

White Paper

11

5. ShellPlugin: The “ShellExecute” option uses the ShellExecute method present
in the object of Shell Application. ShellExecute should be called if the user has
admin privileges. When the command fails, it attempts to disable AntiSPYware
of Windows Defender from the Registry. If the user is not an Admin,
ShellExecute is attempted with elevated permissions using the 'runas' flag
(source). The “get output” option uses the Run method present in the object of
WScript.Shell. The output is stored in a local file. Furthermore, it collects the
user's keyboard language/code page in order to format the output properly.
Upon execution, the malware communicates with C2, which responds with a
PowerShell script that captures the screenshot and saves it to a temp
directory. There have been previous reports of the same PowerShell script
being used in attacks against banks in the UK. Here is the PowerShell script:

(Fig 20.)
Plugins in new versions:
With additional functionality, these files are around three MB in size. There is an
inclusion of DotUtil functions that enables it to download and execute .NET
assemblies in memory. The method “hasDotnet” discussed earlier also hints
about .NET relation with JS.

(Fig 21.)

Given below are DotUtil functions.

(Fig 22.)
In the above DotUtil functions, given below is the most important one (Create
Instance):

(Fig 23.)
libDotJs.dll is downloaded, which has the actual code related to the DotUtil
Functions.
We have fetched the libDotJS.dll module by intercepting the memory of
wscript.exe using x64.dbg. Looking into CFF Explorer

Using dnspy for a clear picture, we can clearly see that there is a complete
mapping of Dotnet modules of the below dll and the ones declared in DotUtil
component of the malicious JavaScript

(Fig 26.)
Let’s now look into Plugins:
1. Activity Plugin: This plugin enables the RAT to be in Online or Offline state. An
adodb.stream object is created when the state is online to save the download
ed/collected data. This plugin (infact all the plugins) is used along with function
receive that is used to interpret commands from C2. Based on the commands
the states are changed by calling corresponding “Activity” Functions through a
switch-case.

(Fig 27.)

2. CensorMiniPlugin: Enables/disables proxy settings on user machine by
modifying registry key “Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
Settings\ProxyEnable” switch-case.

(Fig 28.)
3. AdminConsolePlugin: This plugin changes the authentication level using
“winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\.\root\cimv2”. It uses
command “select * from win32_logicaldisk” and queries drive size,freespace etc.

(Fig 29.)
4. ClipboardPlugin: : It is used to copy the clipboard data and send it over C2. It
can also modify clipboard data.

(Fig 30.)
5. DnsPlugin: I: It is used to send current DNS info to c2 . It can also be used to set
a DNS path. Add or modify new path in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
(source)

(Fig 31.)

6. Multiviewplugin: Has Quality and scaling info.

(Fig 32.)
7. LibraryPlugin: Sends a list of the Dotnet versions installed on the system to C2.
8. OutlookPlugin: It accesses the Outlook account details, and contacts list and
sends it over C2

(Fig 33.)
9. PriviledgePlugin: In this, the option “UAC” allows to write in registry location
“SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\” (source) by
setting value 0 for keys EnableLUA and ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin. The
option “elevateScript” executes the script using wscript.exe with the batch
mode option. The option “elevateCommand” executes commands using Wsh
with the ‘runas’ flag. It also has options for using UAC bypass techniques like
fodhelper.exe, Slui File Handler Hijacking, CompMgmtLauncher,
EventViewer.exe etc.

10. PromptPlugin: This plugin allows the attacker to show his victim a custom
message prompt sent by C2.

(Fig 35.)
11. ProxyPlugin: Sets DNS path. Add or modify a new path in
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts. (source)
12. ShortcutPlugin: Generate shortcut files for given executables. Run the
shortcut file. You can either get the target of a shortcut file or dump its content.

(Fig 36.)
13. RecoveryPlugin: Used for the recovery of user password configurations
14. TokensPlugin: Steal OTP received from SymantecVIP application.

(Fig 37.)
Apart these there are few interesting methods also:
P object: Used to fetch information related to volume serial, resolution,physical
memory info etc

Environment and HTTP objects:

(Fig 41.)
After dropping old versions, a new version is dropped (updated) in a few cases,
which leads to Netwire RAT. Last year we published our research about
Java-based Adwind RAT
(https://www.seqrite.com/blog/java-rat-campaign-targets-co-operative-banks-in-i
ndia/) in which a jar file was the main component

Furthermore, it targeted co-operative banks in India using Covid-themed
attachment names of a similar double-extension format. JSOutProx and Adwind
RATs have identical commands, configuration fields, and user-agent strings. It is
likely that the JSOutProx RAT is linked to the same threat actor since they appear
to use similar jar files as end payloads instead of initial infection vectors to evade
detection
Network:

(Fig 42.)
We captured some attacker engagement with victims. The command
“MTBffF8tMV98XzUwMA==” decodes to “ 10_|_-1_|_500 “ which was issued to
capture screenshots and send them back to C2.
Notice that crafted HTTP header in the request, which helps payload blend into
packets as Content-Type of images. However, this was an old variant of
JsOutProx.

Conclusion
Apparently, this attack
was carried out by a
Threat Actor with a
financial motive.
They are attacking small banks,
where security practices are less
well-defined than those of larger
institutions, thereby increasing
the chance of a successful
infection and a payout.

While the majority of the
analyzed attacks have targeted
Indian banks, we have found
signs of this attack in other
geographies as well. As we have
only limited data, it is difficult to
determine if the attackers are
targeting any particular country.

Based on our Threat Intelligence:

The attackers are
linked to other
organizations.

mplant JsOutProx have
capabilities similar to
FIN-7 APT's Carbanak.
Carbanak shared the
same goals and was
designed to perform
similar tasks.

Hackers launder
money outside
India.

Our clients are advised to apply updates regularly and ensure that their
employees are aware of such types of attacks.
