Military and Associated Terms

As of January 2019

Intentionally Blank

PREFACE
1. Scope
As directed in Joint Publication (JP) 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United
States, the DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (DOD Dictionary) sets forth
standard US military and associated terminology to encompass the joint activity of the
Armed Forces of the United States. These military and associated terms, together with
their definitions, constitute approved Department of Defense (DOD) terminology for
general use by all DOD components.
2. Purpose
This publication supplements standard English-language dictionaries and standardizes
military and associated terminology to improve communication and mutual understanding
within DOD with other US Government departments and agencies and among the United
States and its allies.
3. Application
This publication applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Services, the
Joint Staff (JS), combatant commands, DOD agencies, and all other DOD components. It
is the primary terminology source when preparing correspondence, to include policy,
strategy, doctrine, and planning documents. Criteria for inclusion of terminology in the
DOD Dictionary is enumerated in Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 5025.12,
Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5705.01, Standardization of Military and Associated
Terminology.
4. Format
The primary parts of the DOD Dictionary are:
a. Explanatory notes.
b. Terms and definitions.
c. Shortened word forms (abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms).
d. Summary of changes.
5. DOD Dictionary Online Availability and Update Schedule
The DOD Dictionary is accessible online as a searchable database and in PDF format
at the following Internet address: http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/DOD-Terminology/ and at
the following Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) address:
https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/. The contents of the DOD Dictionary are updated as necessary,

i

Preface
to include terminology additions, modifications, or deletions made, in accordance with
CJCSI 5705.01.
6. Terminology Repository for DOD (Office of the Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff)
Issuances
This publication is supplemented by the Terminology Repository for DOD (Office of the
Secretary of Defense [OSD]/JS) Issuances (Terminology Repository) (For Official Use Only).
Over the last 65 years, specific and technical DOD terms and definitions established in senior
policy document glossaries reside outside of the DOD Dictionary and not subject to joint
doctrine terminology criteria for general and universal usage listed in CJCSI 5705.01. The
25,000+ policy term Terminology Repository provides awareness on those specific or
descriptive terms in defense documents (policy, strategy, planning, doctrine, etc.) that support
the foundation of the 2,500+ doctrine term DOD Dictionary. Its creation is the primary step in
deconflicting terminology nuances within organizational documents that may impact joint
doctrine.
7. Department of Defense Term and Definition Approach
After consulting DODI 5025.12 and CJCSI 5705.01 for term and definition criteria,
proponents of new or existing terms will first review the DOD Dictionary and then access
the Terminology Repository before defaulting to commonly used, English-language
dictionaries in creating new DOD terms and definitions. The repository is combined access
card-enabled and located at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/DOD-Terminology-Program/.
8. Revision and Distribution
Future editions of the DOD Dictionary will be updated according to policy and posted
online at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/DOD-Terminology-Program/. For distribution, Joint
Staff, J-7, does not print copies of the DOD Dictionary. Electronic versions are available on
JEL+ [Joint Electronic Library Plus] at https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/index.jsp?pindex=4
(NIPRNET) and https://jdeis.js.smil.mil/jdeis/index.jsp (SIPRNET) and on the JEL [Joint
Electronic Library] at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine.aspx (Internet).

EXPLANATORY NOTES
1. Updates and Terminology Actions
a. Per guidance in CJCSI 5705.01, terminology actions for the DOD Dictionary
(additions; modifications; revalidations, to include those parts of a JP or
issuance/directive policy revision process; or deletions) are approved using one of the
following five methods:
(1) DOD terminology proposed from JPs;
(2) DOD terminology directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) via specific memorandum;
(3) DOD terminology proposed from DOD (Office of the Secretary of Defense
[OSD] and CJCS) issuances;
(4) Terminology proposed from Allied Administrative Publication-6, North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Glossary of Terms and Definitions (English and
French); and/or
(5) Approved administrative changes/updates by the DOD Terminologist.
b. Per guidance in CJCSI 5705.01, any DOD Dictionary term and definition, where the
identified proponent is an OSD/JS issuance that remains in the document as part of an
organizational change or other revision process must be revalidated or modified as a part of
the revision process. Proponents of terms and definitions that do not follow this process will
result in automatic removal from the DOD Dictionary and movement to the Terminology
Repository of DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances. Any terms identified for removal from OSD/JS
issuances will subsequently be removed from the DOD Dictionary and automatically placed
in the Terminology Repository of DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances.
2. Terminology Categorization (Policy and Joint Doctrine)
a. Military Terminology. Standardized military and associated terminology forms the
foundation of joint doctrine. It enables the joint force to organize, plan, train, and execute
operations with a common language that is clearly articulated and universally understood.
Since 1948, military terms have been codified in the DOD Dictionary. Although different in
purpose, policy documents also require standardized terminology. While some policy terms
are included in the DOD Dictionary, the bulk are codified in the Terminology Repository of
DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances. Policy terms may form the basis of doctrinal terms, further
describe doctrinal concepts, or temporarily fill gaps in joint doctrine until adopted as extant
practice. If included in the DOD Dictionary, policy terms will conform to the CJCSI 5705.01
and standing operating procedure guidelines.
b. Policy and Joint Doctrine. Policy directs and assigns tasks, prescribes desired
capabilities, and provides guidance for ensuring the Armed Forces of the United States are
prepared to perform their assigned roles. Implicitly, policy can create new roles and
1

Explanatory Notes
requirements for new capabilities. Joint doctrine enhances the operational effectiveness of
the Armed Forces by providing authoritative guidance and standardized terminology on topics
relevant to the employment of military forces. Although joint doctrine is neither policy nor
strategy, it serves to make United States policy and strategy effective in the application of US
military power. Terminology developed within policy and joint doctrine serves different
purposes. The terminology required to support the employment of forces (doctrinal terms)
may not be optimal for policy developers, whose purpose may be to illuminate resource or
requirement documents. Terminology developed for DOD policy is not limited by the
constraints imposed on doctrine terminology. Policy definitions may provide the basis for the
doctrinal terms. Doctrinal terms cannot be in conflict with the law, regulation, or policy.
3. Terminology Definition Development
The DOD Dictionary is designed to supplement common English-language dictionaries
with standard terminology for military and associated use. After reviewing policy for criteria
and the DOD Dictionary for existence, developers must consult the Terminology Repository
before defaulting to commonly used, English-language dictionaries as a starting point in
creating new DOD Dictionary terms and definitions. A definition should address the meaning
of the term only and should not contain doctrinal or procedural information (i.e., it should
focus on describing “what” a term is and not “how” or “why” it is used). If additional text
is desired to elaborate on a definition, that information should be provided in the text of the
publication. Accordingly, the following CJCSI 5705.01 and standing operating procedure
criteria are used to determine the acceptability of terminology for inclusion in the DOD
Dictionary:
a. The term in a standard, commonly accepted dictionary is inadequate for DOD use.
b. The term is not a standard dictionary definition with non-definitional text added.
Example: capability - The ability to complete a task or execute a course of action under
specified conditions and level of performance.
c. The term is not self-defining. Example: bomber aircraft – An aircraft that is capable
of delivery bombs.
d. The term is not a policy term that competes or overrides a doctrinal term in the
DOD Dictionary.
e. The proposed term follows established procedures in this issuance. Verification
must be provided that the DOD Terminologist approved; otherwise, the term will only be
reflected in the Terminology Repository.
f. Reflects extant DOD capabilities and practices.
g. Of general military or associated significance. Technical or highly specialized
terms may be included if they can be defined in easily understood language and if their
inclusion is of general military or associated significance.
h. Terms for weaponry are limited to generic weapon systems.
2

Explanatory Notes
i. Are not to consist of or contain shortened word forms (e.g., abbreviations,
acronyms, or initialisms).
j. Must be UNCLASSIFIED (including shortened word forms) and marked as such if
in controlled (e.g., FOUO) or classified documents.
k. Are not prowords, code words, brevity words, or NATO [North Atlantic Treaty
Organization]-only terms.
l. Are not Service-specific or functionality-specific unless they are commonly
employed in US joint force operations.
m. An approved joint term with similar definition does not exist.
n. Must be consistent with US law, treaties, international agreements, and executive
orders.
o. Noun terms should be in singular form.
p. With few exceptions, should be general terms, not proper names.
q. Cross reference entries (i.e., ‘also called’ terms) will not have a separate entry.
Example: ‘Universal Time’ is also called ‘ZULU time,’ but no separate entry for ‘ZULU
time’.
r. Terms must appear and be used in the body of the document, not just in its glossary.
s. Proposed entries should be written as a definition and not as a description.
See CJCSI 5705.01, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, Enclosure
C, Definition Writing Guide, for specific guidance that should be followed when
developing terms and definitions intended for inclusion in the DOD Dictionary.
4. Shortened Word Forms (Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Initialisms)
The DOD Dictionary includes shortened word forms (abbreviations, acronyms, and
initialisms) for DOD and associated military terms. Shortened word forms in the DOD
Dictionary are solely derived from currently approved JP glossaries and not centrally
managed by the program for the joint force. Although all are shortened versions of a word
or phrase, typically by a series of letters, there is a difference.
a. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase pronounced as a word (e.g.,
SecDef).
b. An acronym is a shortened form of a phrase of words, where the letters of the
acronym stand for the terms of its meaning and is also read as a word (e.g., ASAP [as soon
as possible]).

3

Explanatory Notes
c. An initialism is a shortened form of a word or phrase that is not spoken as a word;
each letter is spoken separately (e.g., DOD).
d. Parenthesis Use After Definitions
(1) The term associated with an abbreviation, acronym, or initialism is referred
to as the definition (e.g., the initialism definition for FOUO is ‘for official use only’). In
some cases, there may be another abbreviation, acronym, or initialism in parenthesis
following the definition. If the term is associated with a specific organization, the
definition will include this tag in parenthesis showing it is an organizational-specific term.
For example: ACE -- aviation combat element (USMC) or AFNORTHWEST -- Allied
Forces North West Europe (NATO).
(2) There should only be a DOD Dictionary-approved abbreviation, acronym, or
initialism in the parenthesis.
e. Other Criteria for Shortened Word Forms
The list below is not an exhaustive list of criteria for shortened word forms but is
provided as general guidance for organizations in their creation and management.
Shortened word forms reflect those used in individual joint doctrine publications.
Additional detail on shortened word form construction and guidance may be found in
organizational standard operating procedures. Avoid overuse of shortened word forms.
(1) Must be unclassified and marked as such if in controlled or classified
documents. This means a glossary has to be marked unclassified to have the terms and
definitions considered for inclusion in the DOD Dictionary or Terminology Repository.
(2) Must be more than one letter.
(3) Should avoid duplicating existing shortened word forms and must only have
one meaning within a single document.
(4) Should generally use capital letters.
(5) Should only be created when needed and commonly used. All terms do not
need a shortened word form.
(6) Establish in a document only when the term is used more than once within
the body.
(7) Should not be used to create other shortened word forms (e.g., “Director,
NRO” does not establish “DNRO,” regardless if “NRO” was established earlier in the text).
(8) Should not be established as part of another shortened word form for use later
in the text (e.g., if “C-2X” is being established using “counterintelligence and human
intelligence staff element,” the definition cannot be written as “counterintelligence [CI]

4

Explanatory Notes
and human intelligence [HUMINT] staff element” to establish CI and HUMINT for later
use).
5. Terminology Repository for Department of Defense (Office of the Secretary of
Defense/Joint Staff) Issuances
The Terminology Repository was established to provide awareness on specific and
technical policy terms and definitions that reside outside the DOD Dictionary (universal and
general terms). The Terminology Repository supports the foundation that the DOD Dictionary
is the primary terminology source. When accessing joint publications or policy, strategy, and
planning documents, users should review both the DOD Dictionary and the Terminology
Repository to develop a full understanding of how a term may be described, defined, or used
to proceed accordingly. It is also recommended that all glossary developers also use the criteria
enumerated in paragraph 2 in maintaining terms and definitions. Like the DOD Dictionary,
the Terminology Repository is unclassified and uncontrolled. Unlike the DOD Dictionary, the
Terminology Repository is not meant to capture or track shortened word forms such as
abbreviations, acronyms, or initialisms. The Terminology Repository can be found on the
Terminology Program webpage at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/DOD-Terminology-Program/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
1. Supersession
a. This document supersedes the DOD Dictionary as of November 2018. The terms
and definitions in the DOD Dictionary will be updated, per approval and according to
policy, by modification, deletion, or addition, or remain per revalidation, in accordance
with DODI 5025.12 and CJCSI 5705.01.
b. Shortened word forms (i.e., abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms) in the DOD
Dictionary are solely derived from currently approved JP glossaries and not centrally
managed by the program for the joint force. As of May 2016, those shortened word forms
not currently found in active JPs were removed.
