Nobelium Returns to the Political World Stage

February 24, 2022

Nobelium, also known as APT29 and Cozy Bear, is a highly sophisticated group of Russiansponsored cybercriminals. Approximately two years ago, countless system administrators
and IT teams were forced to work around the clock to address Nobelium’s attack on
SolarWinds. And last year, they similarly targeted numerous IT supply chains in the hopes of
being able to embed themselves once again deep inside IT networks. But fast forward to
today, and the Nobelium group seems to have shifted their focus. This time, rather than
targeting software solutions, they have begun targeting embassies. While these attacks may
not impact the average Windows computer user, they do have potentially larger political
ramifications.
FortiGuard Labs has uncovered evidence that the Nobelium group is impersonating
someone associated with the Turkish embassy in targeted email-based attacks. We will be
analyzing one such attack that uses Omicron/Covid-19 as a lure. Those working in or around
embassies are urged to be extra diligent when opening emails.

In this blog, we will highlight techniques and code reuse by Nobelium. We will also highlight
the usage of JARM, which is a widely used technology created by Salesforce to fingerprint
and track malicious servers.
Affected Platforms: Windows
Impacted Users: Windows users associated with the targeted embassies
Impact: Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actor
Severity Level: Medium
Figure 1: Embassy email
The source email address seems to be a legitimate, albeit compromised email account of a
government department focused on social affairs. In tracing this, however, this email comes
from a French-speaking country in Africa. It is disguised as coming from a Turkish embassy
and sent to a Portuguese-speaking nation, although it is written in English.
The email itself comes with a .HTML file attachment. This file contains malicious JavaScript
designed to create an .ISO file on the user’s computer. Figure 2 shows some similarities
between a previous Nobelium attack and this current version.
Figure 2: Malicious Javascript
The original HTML Smuggling attack conducted by Nobelium used EnvyScout to convert a
text blob into an .ISO file. EnvyScout is one of the toolsets used as a dropper in
spearphishing attacks by this APT group. As seen in Figure 2, both samples used an
application type of “x-cd-image.” This part of the attack has changed very little. However,
Figure 3 below shows the function used to create the .ISO file has been streamlined from
previous iterations.
Figure 3: ISO creation
Once the .ISO file has been created on the user’s machine, the attack requires a user to
open the file. By default, opening an .ISO file on modern versions of Windows causes it to
mount the file on the next available drive letter. Once mounted, the files can be seen. Figure
4 below shows this part of the attack chain.

One of the previous variants of the Nobelium attack was dated almost exactly one year prior
to the current attack. Both versions contain malicious shortcuts that point to a DLL file. In the
current version, the DLL file inside the bin folder is named
“DeleteDateConnectionPosition.dll.”
In the past, one of the payloads used was a Cobalt Strike beacon, and this is the case in this
current version. Given the current political situation, it is clearly in Russia’s best interest to
know what other governments are thinking, planning, and doing, and successful installation

of a Cobalt Strike beacon provides a foothold into the embassies they are interested in
monitoring. To achieve this objective, the shortcut launches the DLL using an export named
“DeleteDateConnectionPosition.”
Figure 5: DLL Exports
Many of the exports inside the DLL contain junk code. As such, debugging the malware is
faster than statically analyzing it. Once completed we discovered a C2 server, as shown
below.
Figure 6: Debugging the malicious DLL
According to our sources, this server is not a shared server and the IP address only contains
the sinitude[.]com domain.

JARM Fingerprinting
For those unfamiliar with JARM, it is a technology developed by Salesforce to fingerprint
servers for the purposes of clustering. Specifically, JARM revolves around a server’s TLS
implementation. As further explained by Salesforce, it is not a secure crypto function, and as
a result, it may produce false positives. Nevertheless, it has been a fairly accurate way to
group malicious servers into relevant clusters.
The JARM signature for sinitude[.]com has been found on numerous servers. Many of these
servers have also acted as Cobalt Strike beacon C2 servers. During the course of our
investigation, we found that this JARM signature was also found on C2 servers associated
with the malware family BazarLoader. BazarLoader, among other things, contains code and
application guardrails that makes sure it is not running on a Russian computer.
By looking at network traffic since the beginning of this year, we found that several IP
addresses are connected to sinitude[.]com. However, our data indicates that only one IP
address (back in January) actually created a full connection to communicate with the C2.
This IP address is located in Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine. This Kharkiv IP
address itself has communicated with unique malware families and is part of the TOR
network.

Conclusion
In this latest attack, Nobelium has used techniques similar to those they have used in the
past. Malicious emails remain the predominant way to infiltrate organizations, and Nobelium
takes advantage of that attack vector. The biggest difference now is the political landscape.
While previous attacks carried out by Nobelium may have been more technical in nature, this
latest round has far more consequences on the political world stage.
