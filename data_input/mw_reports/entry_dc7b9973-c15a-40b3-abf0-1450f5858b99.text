REPORT SUMMARY

The ever widening use of the Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) protocol to
exchange data between entities in the energy industry, coupled with the confidential, sensitive
nature of much of this data, is giving rise to data security concerns related to ICCP use. This
report examines how the ICCP protocol addresses data security and summarizes data security
threats and recommended preliminary solutions.
Background
EPRI first introduced the ICCP (also known as TASE.2) to help standardize communications
between control centers. ICCP applications now also include communication between control
centers and power plants and substations and between nodes of NERC’s Inter-regional Security
Network (ISN). At last count, over 200 installations of ICCP were completed in the U.S. and in
many other countries at transmission companies, energy companies, and grid operators. The
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Standards Organization
(ISO) have adopted ICCP in the form of three international standards. ICCP uses a well-proven,
robust, existing standard called the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) for the
messaging service. With deregulation – and the resultant increased competition – the security of
operational data exchanged using ICCP between control centers and other locations becomes
increasingly important.
Objective
To provide energy companies, regional transmission organizations (RTOs), and other
stakeholders information on the current state of data security related to ICCP use
Approach
The project team gathered information from existing EPRI reports and other documentation,
conducted interviews with experts in networking and data security, and synthesized information
that was relevant to ICCP data security. They prepared the report for a diverse audience—
technical and non-technical middle-level managers at domestic and international energy
companies, RTOs, equipment and system vendors in the energy industry, and other stakeholders.
Industry experts then reviewed the report for completeness and accuracy.
Results
This report reviews issues associated with secure communications between energy control
centers and specifically addresses the role of ICCP. The report provides an introduction to ICCP
and its applications, identifies data security threats in ICCP, covers the limited data security
features within ICCP, and discusses preliminary data security solutions that experts have
proposed.
v

ICCP provides access control via bilateral tables maintained on an ICCP server. This is the only
data security service provided within ICCP; and, to date, no additional data security services
within ICCP have been proposed. The documents synthesized to prepare this report did not
identify specific additions of data security measures to be implemented within ICCP. The ICCP
protocol designers assumed that additional data security measures would be implemented in
various layers of the open systems interconnection (OSI) 7-layer stack. Hence, this report
discusses data security that ICCP provides via bilateral tables, briefly covers physical security,
and provides an overview of preliminary data security solutions relevant to ICCP that experts
have proposed for implementation in various layers of the OSI 7-layer stack. These preliminary
solutions are organized according to the five types of data security services defined by the OSI
model—authentication, access control, data confidentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudiation.
The report also describes a proposed system, currently in review, that defines a new Application
Service Element (ASE) called Security Transformations Application Service Element for MMS
(STASE-MMS). Residing between MMS and the presentation layer in the OSI protocol stack,
the proposed system supports data security services for MMS protocol data units and MMS
objects. Proposers point out that this system can, in turn, secure data being communicated using
the ICCP protocol.
EPRI Perspective
EPRI has been instrumental in the development and adoption of ICCP worldwide. As use of
ICCP expands to a wider range of applications, EPRI continues to address issues of interest to
ICCP users. As a result of industry restructuring, trends that include increasing demands on the
existing power system, the increasing amount of confidential information exchange, and the
growing number of players exchanging this information are giving rise to concerns over data
security when ICCP is used. This report is the beginning of a process in which EPRI is
examining data security issues relevant to ICCP and recommending security-related
enhancements. To continue this process, EPRI plans to publish a second report with specific data
security recommendations for ICCP in 2002.

ABSTRACT

In the mid 1990s, EPRI’s Grid Operations and Planning Area brought together key members of
the electric industry to design a proposed standard for the interchange of control center data. At
that time the industry had no standards for data exchange and sharing of data was very limited
due to complexity/customization issues between utilities. EPRI first introduced the Inter-Control
Center Communications Protocol (ICCP, also known as the International Standard or TASE.2) to
help standardize communications between control centers. ICCP applications now also include
communication between control centers and power plants and substations and between nodes of
NERC’s Inter-regional Security Network (ISN). Now an accepted international standard, ICCP
uses a well-proven, robust, existing standard called the Manufacturing Message Specification
(MMS) for the messaging service. As a result of industry restructuring, trends that include
increasing demands on the existing power system, the increasing amount of confidential
information exchange, and the ever widening number of players exchanging this information are
giving rise to concerns over data security when ICCP is used. A synthesis of information from a
variety of reports and papers, this report provides an introduction to ICCP and its applications,
identifies data security threats in ICCP, describes the limited data security measures
implemented within ICCP, and discusses potential data security solutions relevant to ICCP that
experts have proposed for implementation in various layers of the OSI 7-layer stack. The report
also describes a proposed system, currently in review, that defines a new Application Service
Element (ASE) called Security Transformations Application Service Element for MMS (STASEMMS). To continue the process of examining data security issues relevant to ICCP and
recommending data-related enhancements, EPRI plans to publish a second report with specific
data security recommendations for ICCP in 2002.

ICCP PRIMER

Introduction
Since its initial use in the mid 1990s, ICCP (TASE.2) has become the international standard form
of communication between energy control centers, and between control centers and power plants
and substations. It is also the primary protocol used on NERC’s Inter-regional security network
(ISN), is used for control center to ISO/RTO communications, and is being considered for even
wider adoption.
ICCP is the most widely adopted communications protocol available to the electric power
industry today, with over 200 completed installations in the United States, and in many other
countries, at transmission companies, energy companies, and grid operators. A wide range of
hardware and software vendors support ICCP, allowing energy companies to implement the
protocol inexpensively.
Since ICCP is instrumental in helping energy control centers maintain a high level of power
system security (i.e., reliability), discussing the data security aspects of ICCP can lead to some
confusion. To avoid any misunderstanding, this report refers to either power system security or
data security.

Evolution of ICCP
The electric power industry uses more operating data than perhaps any other industry. Seamless
communication of this information to appropriate locations smoothes the process of generating,
transmitting, and distributing electricity. To achieve this objective, over the years energy
companies developed their own custom-designed communications protocols to facilitate
exchange of these data from one location to another. Unfortunately, these protocols were often
developed on an as-needed basis, leading to a proliferation of proprietary, incompatible
protocols. Around 1980, most energy companies that possessed inter-control center
communications capabilities used these proprietary, custom-developed protocols for point-topoint transmission.
In the years leading up to 1980 (before the days of independent system operators, ISOs, or
regional transmission organizations, RTOs), North America witnessed an increase in cooperative
enterprises such as power pools and regional centers. Industry participants needed the seamless
exchange of data but found themselves hampered by the technical and economic limitations of
the available protocols.

ICCP Primer

This led two groups of energy companies, first one in the western U.S. and then later one in the
eastern U.S, to begin design of a common protocol they could all use. Their objective was to rid
themselves of the costly difficulties of using proprietary protocols.
In the western U.S, members of the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) initiated
efforts in the early 1980s to develop an inter-energy company data communications standard.
This group succeeded in developing the initial version of what became known as the WSCC
protocol. Later, in the mid 1980s, a group of energy companies in the eastern United States
formed the Inter-Utility Data Exchange Consortium (IDEC) and developed the inter-utility data
exchange protocol. Elcom 83 and Elcom 90 were used in Europe.
IEEE explains that “as the need for a unified standard became clear, the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) solicited member bodies for contributions to be considered
for international standardization. The lack of a consensus standard in the U.S., as well as the
perceived limitations of all of the existing candidate protocols, led to the formation of a
utility/vendor task force sponsored by EPRI, WSCC, IDEC, and a number of utilities. This task
force led development of the Intercontrol Center Communications Protocol (ICCP). The name
was later changed to the Telecontrol Application Service Element 2 (TASE.2) to conform to IEC
Technical Committee 57 Working Group 7 taxonomy.” These efforts culminated in the late
1990s when ICCP received official status as an international standard (see “IEEE 1999” in
bibliography for more information).
While this effort to develop ICCP was proceeding, dramatic changes were taking place in the
U.S. energy industry. The 1996 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) passage of
Orders 888 and 889 mandated “open access” to the U.S. transmission system. This and other
legislative and regulatory changes presented major implications for energy company
communications of data. The amount and types of data exchanged between energy companies,
between energy companies and new entities, and within various parts of each energy company
expanded dramatically. Secure wide area operation of the power system necessitated effective
communication of data between energy control centers. And as ISOs began operation,
communication between energy companies and these new entities became necessary. This need
will only increase, as the FERC continues to move aggressively forward to mandate formation of
a finite number of RTOs in the U.S.
Increasing demands on the power system have also fueled the need to effectively communicate
data. As wholesale transactions of power increase in magnitude and frequency, securely
operating a power system strained by these transactions becomes increasingly challenging. In
light of these developments, efficient communication between involved parties to ensure secure
power system operation becomes a necessity, rather than simply a beneficial capability.
The drive to maintain power system security amidst these changes has resulted in establishment
of new types of systems and networks. For example, the Inter-regional Security Network (ISN)
established by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) provides coordinated
power system security processes both regionally and in individual control areas. But such a
system needed a way for the security coordinators and other participants to communicate needed
data using standard protocols.

ICCP Primer

U.S. energy industry restructuring has also led to the deregulation of the power generation
function in many parts of the country. The consequent buying and selling of generation assets
has led to new entrants in the power business, new business models in the power generation
industry, and other fundamental structural changes. This, in turn, has led to added complexity in
communicating between energy control centers or ISOs/RTOs and these power plants.
But maintaining power system security is not the only motivation for a uniform communications
protocol. In order to succeed in the deregulated power generation market, energy companies look
to curtail operating costs by improving operating efficiency and reducing maintenance
expenditures. Hence, communication of information must be accomplished cost effectively.
ICCP is meeting each of these needs for a standardized communication protocol, as well as other
emerging applications.

ICCP Today
ICCP is a modern comprehensive client/server protocol (see Figure 1-1). Data exchange
information consists of real-time and historical power system monitoring and control data,
including measured values, scheduling data, energy accounting data, and operator messages.
ICCP also defines a mechanism for exchanging time-critical data between locations.
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Standards
Organization (ISO) adopted ICCP in the form of the following international standards:
•

TASE.2 Services and Protocol (IEC 60870-6-503)

•

TASE.2 Object Models (IEC 60870-6-802)

•

TASE.2 Application Profile (IEC 60870-6-702).

ICCP uses a well-proven, robust, existing standard called the Manufacturing Message
Specification (MMS) for the messaging service. MMS (ISO/IEC-9506) was designed to facilitate
the exchange of real-time application data among manufacturing and process control systems and
is broad enough in scope to address the needs of many industry sectors.
MMS is an object-oriented program, allowing organization of a complex system into a collection
of easily understood, discrete objects that incorporate both information and behavior. This means
that MMS is relatively easy to implement and maintain. ICCP uses MMS objects to define
messages and data structures, and all ICCP operations run form these objects. Supported data
types include control messages, status, analogs, quality codes, schedules, text and simple files. In
addition to data exchange, optional functions include remote control, operator station output,
events, and remote program execution. Using MMS as a foundation enables use of widely
available telecommunications technologies, such as frame relays and ISDN lines.

environment to an inter-SCADA environment. Source: ”IEC 1999” in bibliography

ICCP and the Utility Communications Architecture (UCATM)
ICCP is part of the Utility Communications Architecture (UCA). IEEE defines UCA as a
“standards-based approach to utility communications that provides for wide-scale integration at
reduced costs and solves many of the most pressing communication problems for today’s
utilities. The UCA is designed to apply across all of the functional areas within the electric, gas,
and water utilities. These functional areas include customer interface, distribution, transmission,
power plant, and control centers” (see “IEEE 1999” in bibliography for more information).
As IEEE explains, the role that ICCP plays is best understood by examining the two main types
of applications that involve exchange of real-time data acquisition and control information in the
energy industry:
1. Access to real-time databases (e.g., supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA,
systems, and energy management systems, or EMS)
2. Access to real-time devices (e.g., remote terminal units, switchgear, and meters)

1-4

ICCP Primer

UCA supports access to real-time databases through ICCP (see “IEEE 1999” in bibliography for
more information).
The three IEEE standards for TASE.2 (IEC 60870-6-503, IEC 60870-6-802, and IEC 60870-6702) are published independently of the rest of UCA, but are included by reference in UCA
Version 2.0.

Data Exchange Using ICCP
Data types that can be exchanged between two or more ICCP nodes include the following (see
Table 1-1 for a complete list):
•

Real-time process analog and discrete control and data acquisition signals used by the
existing remote terminal units (RTUs) and new substation automation computers

•

Historical data such as average values of accumulations over time

•

Predefined reports

•

Unit forecast schedule data

•

Unit commitment data

•

Simultaneous updating of generation report requirements through utilization of a common
distributed database.

ICCP Applications
ICCP capabilities range from linking wide-area interconnected power systems to facilitating
internal communications. Table 1-2 provides a list of types of ICCP communication applications,
along with other protocols used in each application. The types of data links (e.g., dedicated
point-to-point and frame relay WAN with routers) are discussed in the context of data security in
Chapter 2.
Linking individual control centers with regional coordinators, ICCP enables real-time exchange
of system data, such as MW, MVAR, kV, and breaker status, allowing instant assessment of the
interconnected networks. For example, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) collects data via two
ICCP systems. As transmission security coordinator, SPP collects operational data from 17
control areas via an ICCP-compliant communications system. Data, collected within 30 seconds,
are used to perform state estimation and power flow modeling.
SPP also collects operational data from neighboring control areas with the ICCP-compliant
communications system in place on the NERC ISN. Capabilities include anticipating
contingencies and taking both preventive measures prior to a disturbance and corrective
measures in the event of a disturbance.

The latter example illustrates the pivotal role ICCP plays as the only protocol used to exchange
real-time data between ISN nodes. The ISN is comprised of 18 security coordinator systems
interconnected via ICCP operating over a frame relay network. Each security coordinator is in
turn connected to one or more control areas to obtain the electric system security data needed for
the security coordinators to perform operational power system security assessments and
coordinate reliable operations. This latter connection has no specific protocol requirements
placed on it. Each security coordinator is free to choose the protocols most appropriate for their
control area.

ICCP Primer

Now functional with links to all ten U.S. NERC regions, the ISN is designed to provide
coordinated power system security processes both regionally and within individual control areas.
Central to the success of the ISN is the use of ICCP as the communications highway.

Data exchange can take place between the following entities:
•

Security coordinator to other security coordinators

•

Control area to security coordinator

•

Control area to other control areas via a common security coordinator or over the ISN if
attached to different security coordinators.

The electric system security data to be exchanged over these links is described in Table 1-3. The
data with specific elements identified on the right side of the table is updated and sent every ten
minutes. The remainder of the data is updated whenever it changes and is available.
ISOs/RTOs present another important application of ICCP. In this case, energy companies are
able to directly communicate with the ISO/RTO control center(s) using a standardized protocol.

Sample ICCP Application for Internal Communication
Applications of ICCP for internal communications include communication between control
centers that the same energy company operates. Neighboring control centers can communicate
with each other easily, transmitting the entire range of real-time and historical power system
monitoring and control data.
Other internal communication needs that ICCP facilitates include communication between a
control center and transmission substations for purposes of substation control. For power plant
control from control centers, ICCP enables direct digital communication between power plant
control and central dispatch systems. Load-following commands are transmitted to selected

generators via the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) network. In this
application, ICCP also provides for additional communications comprising outage scheduling,
reporting of availability and real-time status reporting of emissions data, and forecasting.
By deploying ICCP for communication between control centers and power plants, power
producers benefit from improved accuracy, speed, and flexible response for load demands and
transmission grid stability. The enabling technology enables power producers to be more agile
and responsive when business success requires quick and accurate management decisions. A
project at GPU illustrates the value of ICCP in this type of application.

Need at GPU
As documented in “EPRI 1999” in the bibliography, the GPU Demonstration Project deployed
ICCP for connecting power plant control systems to the organization’s energy management
system. The organization lacked a standard communications link between the generating units
DCS, the central dispatching systems energy management control system, the corporate client
server environment, and the legacy corporate mainframe. Each of these systems contained data
generated by one or more of the other systems. Unit control and financial data were transmitted
throughout the organization, often over public data paths. Access to this data by a competitor
would jeopardize the company’s competitive edge, and data security was a critical issue.
The GPU energy management system (EMS) is located in a corporate facility separate from the
electric generating stations. This project linked the EMS to three different plants with the
following DCSs:
•

Conemaugh Station with a Honeywell DCS

•

Portland Station with a Westinghouse DCS

•

Shawville Station with a Bailey DCS

The primary objective of the project was integrating the corporate power plant process data to
the client server environment. A secondary objective was to demonstrate the ability to exchange
data between different DCS systems over the WAN. Because of the geographic differences
between the plan locations, as well as the heterogeneous DCS systems, a detailed risk analysis
was required to validate that the LAN/WAN was secure.
The ICCP Solution at GPU
The system implemented was based on the hierarchical control functions performed in each of
the modules. A spatial model was developed based on the objective tree of the project. The shortterm objective focused on delivering an operational communications systems based on the longterm needs of the organization. This prototype system delivered capability for data exchange
functionality between the various DCS and the EMS. This functional operation was selected to
validate the life-cycle methodology and provide immediate benefit to the organization.
The initial phase of the project established the ICCP digital link between the EMS and DCS. The
project team developed and established all necessary interfaces for exchanging the required data
over the ICCP links, whether analog, discrete, or object format. This was followed by
implementation of the selected applications to demonstrate viability of the enabling technology.

The team anticipated the following results from the study:
• Reduced dependence on verbal communication between the dispatching center and unit
control rooms, resulting in an expected cost-saving of five man-hours per month during peak
system coordination.
• Elimination of RTUs at the stations, reducing the station book value by approximately
$65,000 and associated O&M costs by 40 man-hours per year.
• Reduction in Lost Generation Report Accounting development time by two man-hours per
month.
• Relief of 45 man-hours per month for the Group Shift supervisor due to automation of the

Results of ICCP Project at GPU
Both of the objectives for this project – integrating corporate power plant process data to the
client server environment and exchanging data between two different DCS systems over the
WAN – were met. The project demonstrated through the use of selected applications the ability
to transmit/receive data and objects for information exchange and unit dispatch control between
dissimilar systems. In addition, GPU found that integration through a standard protocol such as
ICCP enabled greater efficiency and improved production while reducing costs.
The project team found the ICCP system easy to install. When configuring an ICCP connection,
precise spelling (including case) is critical. Most of the problems encountered during installation
were due to minor configuration errors. Databases on both the Honeywell PHD and Siemen’s
ICCPNT were easy to configure and maintain. The Honeywell receiver data interfaces (RDIs)
were easily configured into the system and provided a good method of exacting data from the
various DCS. The LAN connection could be either Ethernet or Token Ring. With NT-based PCs,
Honeywell’s PHD and RDIs, and Siemen’s ICCPNT, the team found that they could transmit
data to almost any system with minimal effort.

ICCP is not the only state-of-the-art, standards-based control center tool. While ICCP serves as
the standard for communication of data, two sets of standards-based approaches EPRI also

Information Model (CIM)--provide a standard interface and standard model format for exchange
of data between control centers.

from various sources by specifying the data that applications will share and how they will share
it. The heart of the CCAPI, the CIM defines the essential structure of a power system model in

THREAT/VULNERABILITY IDENTIFICATION IN ICCP

Summary
The major threats to control center data security are bypassing controls, integrity violation,
authorization violation, indiscretion by personnel, illegitimate use, and information leakage.
Motivations for control center attacks include disgruntled current or previous employees (who
initiate 80 percent of all data security attacks), financial rewards, “causes,” and the ability to
demonstrate capability. NERC has identified malicious external hackers, disgruntled employees,
unintentional employee errors, and “trusted” external users as the four general threats to the
Inter-regional Security Network (ISN).

Introduction
Whenever a system is designed to exchange data among various entities, including the use of
ICCP, the focus on data security issues is important. In the case of the GPU example of ICCP
application at the end of chapter 1, project investigators conducted a risk analysis for the project.
This analysis identified threats that relate to ICCP from the following categories:
•

Intentional human intervention – the deliberate disruption of control of the data link. While
the source of this type of intrusion is usually within the organization, knowledgeable outside
hackers also fall into this category.

•

Accidental human intervention – the accidental or procedural failure by which an individual
is able to access the data link.

•

Physical threats – a category that might cause faulty data or physical loss of equipment and
services.

•

Natural threats such as storms and fires.

Of the four threats the team identified, the first two relate to data security, and the third threat
relates to physical security. Although little publicly available information exists on attacks on
energy company communication systems, this does not rule out the possibility that such attacks
are taking place. For example, many energy companies may not be aware that such attacks are
occurring or may opt not to disclose these events—both of which are endemic in other industries.
As more data is transmitted outside the physical control center, the acquisition of such
information by hackers, disgruntled employees, or terrorists increases in possibility. The
likelihood of such threats leading to problems also increases as the financial motivation rises
2-1

Threat/Vulnerability Identification in ICCP

(due to the ability to profit from power market information) and the ease of conducting attacks
rises (due to technological advances and easy access online to hacking tools).
According to a recent EPRI survey (EPRI 2000a) of energy companies and vendors regarding
current communication security practices, the main threats to control center data security are in
the following areas (in order, most likely threats first, with percent of respondents listing the
threat in parentheses):
•

Bypassing controls (42 percent)

•

Integrity violation -- interception and/or alteration (40 percent)

•

Authorization violation (38 percent)

•

Indiscretion by personnel (35 percent)

•

Illegitimate use and information leakage (32 percent)

None of the perceived threats currently cause widespread concern among end-users, although
concern about data security threats increases as the size of the energy company increases
(according to peak load). Table 2-1 compares the percent of all respondents (“aggregate
response”) expressing concern about data security threats with the percent of respondents from
large energy companies expressing this concern (data based on 160 respondents). For
technologies currently in use that are relevant to ICCP, Table 2-1 also illustrates the type of data
security risks that control centers face, according to the survey. As communication outside of the
control center via the Internet and WAN connections increases, so do potential data security
exposures.
The survey also found that hackers and disgruntled employees are the highest perceived intruder
threats to the control center, while competitors and terrorists are of concern among fewer
respondents. After summarizing the motivations for attacks on control centers, this chapter
examines each of the individual data security threats and vulnerabilities that are relevant to
ICCP.

Motivation for Attacks
Motivations for data security attacks on portions of energy companies’ and other players’
infrastructures that are relevant to ICCP range from financial gain to mayhem. The following
motivations are discussed in order of importance.
Financial Rewards
In the deregulated energy industry, advance information on outages or lower than predicted
available power would represent a financial advantage to the traders of wholesale power. Such
advance information could allow traders to reap millions of dollars of revenue per transaction.

However, the financial rewards of eavesdropping are directly related to the timeliness of the
information. “Fresher” information yields higher potential financial rewards. Therefore, the part
of the appropriate data security objective to combat this threat is to protect the information
during the time period over which the information has value. For example, the fact that surplus
generation is available for the next hour should be protected for a relatively short period of time
– about five minutes. Disclosure into the appropriate channels would occur rapidly in order for
the surplus power to be sold, and data security is required only until the information is disclosed
2-3

Threat/Vulnerability Identification in ICCP

properly. This approach is valuable because limited protection of information is much easier to
address than perpetual protection.
As with capital equipment, the value of information typically decreases with time. While an
expired login password has no value, a one-year generation schedule may represent significant
value. Therefore, control centers managers should determine the time period during which each
data type has value.
Disgruntled Employee
Current or previous employees initiate 80 percent of all data security attacks. Abuse by current
employees with appropriate access to information is difficult to prevent. However, effective
corporate security policies include provisions for restricting access by previous employees.
Because assigning a general username/password alone for employee remote login requires that
the username/password be changed whenever an employee departs, administrators are
increasingly assigning specific username/passwords or combining two authentication methods
(e.g., a password and a token).
Cause Motivation
Religion, politics, and other closely held beliefs might motivate attacks on control centers.
Depending upon the level of motivation, the “cause” could manifest itself in disruption,
rendering of certain assets useless, or extensive damage and cost.
Demonstration of Capability
Individuals may cause disruption and damage as a way to demonstrate their capability and
power.

Threat Types
Bypassing Controls
Recent FERC orders and industry restructuring have unwittingly created financial incentives for
accessing operational cost data maintained in control center EMS systems. Hackers, disgruntled
employees (or ex-employees) or competitors may bypass authentication and computer access
control schemes for the purpose of obtaining confidential data for financial gain and/or
modifying data to sabotage power system operations. In the case of ICCP, this involves
bypassing the bilateral table form of access control built into ICCP (see Section 3). Hackers may
also be able to gain access to data that use ICCP by accessing MMS directly.

2-4

Threat/Vulnerability Identification in ICCP

Integrity Violation
An unauthorized user could send false information to the EMS by tapping into an ICCP network
or SCADA network. The false data would appear as valid data sent from an RTU. This could
cause a control center EMS operator to take incorrect actions (e.g., in response to a false out-oflimit measurement reading, or a false trip reading fro a circuit breaker). Unless the operator took
an inappropriate action, no harm would occur to the power system.
Similarly, an unauthorized user could tap into an ICCP or SCADA network and send false
information to a substation or power plant. In the case of a substation, this could cause breakers
or switches to open or close, causing local outages, or even wide area blackouts in critical
transmission substations. In the case of a power plant, consequences could include improperly
changing a set point on a generator.
For an integrity violation to occur, the data would need to be modified at one of the following
locations:
•

The EMS/SCADA database and/or ICCP clients/servers in a control center

•

SCADA master or substation computer in the substation

•

The control system computer in the power plant.

•

The data circuit between the control center and substation, power plant, or other control
center.

Authorization Violation
Unauthorized users could obtain access to data and/or software. This threat could result from a
trusted, external source who has gained certain access rights, but who has violated the access
rights granted. Control centers that rely on physical security and authentication, and ICCP alone,
which relies only on built-in bilateral table access control, are vulnerable.
Indiscretion by Personnel
The following types of inadvertent mistakes by employees can impact system operations and
network reliability:
•

Data entry error

•

Inadvertent disclosure of confidential data (e.g., via improper disposal methods)

•

Incorrect system command entry

•

Changes to software source code

There is a high vulnerability to indiscretion at most control centers. Data entry errors and
inadvertent disclosure by enabling garbage diving represent the most prevalent types of
personnel indiscretion.
2-5

Threat/Vulnerability Identification in ICCP

Illegitimate Use and Information Leakage
Illegitimate use and information leakage, which compromises the confidentiality of sensitive
information, is a key threat for ISOs/RTOs. Cost, scheduling, and outage data transmitted
between control centers are potential targets for illegitimate use.

Example of ICCP Data Security Concers: NERC ISN
The NERC ISN uses ICCP exclusively for real-time data exchange. ICCP is also used (along
with ftp) to transmit configuration data via off-line file transfer.
From a communication security perspective, the following are known security requirements for
the NERC ISN:
•

Integrity and accuracy of operational data

•

Confidentiality of data, especially ensuring that purchasing/selling entities in the wholesale
merchant community are not able to access the operational data.

NERC has identified the following four general threat sources to the ISN:
•

Malicious, external hacker

•

Disgruntled employee

•

Unintentional employee error

•

“Trusted” external user

Potential damage resulting from these threats depends upon the extent of the intrusion or error
and ranges from a brief loss of system functionality to database or software corruption that
results in extended loss of availability and lengthy recovery. Database content alteration could
propagate invalid information to critical decision support systems and potentially disrupt power
grid operations.
Based on these general data security requirements, range of threat sources, and serious potential
consequences of intrusion or error, examining data security provisions in ICCP is warranted to
protect the ISN alone. Consideration of the additional uses of ICCP in a range of energy
company communication applications listed in Table 1-2 reinforces this conclusion.

PRELIMINARY SOLUTIONS

ICCP provides access control via bilateral tables maintained on an ICCP server. This is the only
data security service provided within ICCP. To date, no additional data security services within
ICCP have been proposed. Further, documents synthesized to prepare this report did not identify
specific additions of data security measures to be implemented within ICCP. The ICCP protocol
designers assumed that additional data security measures—such as authentication to ensure users
are who they say they are and encryption to ensure data integrity—would be implemented in
various layers of the OSI 7-layer stack.
Based on information presented in “EPRI 2000a” in the bibliography, this chapter discusses data
security that ICCP provides via bilateral tables, briefly covers physical security, and provides an
overview of preliminary data security solutions that can be implemented in various layers of the
OSI 7-layer stack. These preliminary solutions are organized according to the five types of data
security services defined by the OSI model—authentication, access control, data confidentiality,
data integrity, and nonrepudiation. The solutions covered in this chapter are preliminary; EPRI
plans to publish a second report with specific data security recommendations for ICCP in 2002.

Data Security in ICCP
ICCP specifies access control through the use of bilateral tables defined for each client/server
association. Clearly specified in IEC 60870-6-503 (ICCP Services and Protocol), bilateral tables
provide execute, read/write, read-only, or no access for each item that can be requested by a
client. The server checks each client request to verify that the client has access rights to the data
or capability requested. An ICCP client can view only data pre-approved and listed in these
tables. Either a client or a server can initially establish an association, and an established
association can be used by either a client or server application, independent of how the
association was established. The Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS)
performance specifies how associations are used in ICCP actual configurations.
Implementation, including the management and maintenance of these tables, is a “local
implementation issue.” As a result, each vendor that markets a product based on ICCP can
choose how to implement the bilateral tables, including the type of operator interface provided.
This means that an actual physical table is not required, as long as the functionality is
implemented according to the ICCP specification.
In some cases, ICCP users may decide not to use the data security mechanisms provided through
bilateral tables (e.g., ICCP use between two regional control centers within the same energy
company). One way to handle this is to provide the same access to all control center objects in
3-1

Preliminary Solutions

the Virtual Control Center to any client. However, the protocol operations and actions defined in
the ICCP specifications must be implemented to ensure interoperability.

Physical Security
Physical security is important to control access to devices that can, in turn, enable access to data
being exchanged using ICCP. The majority of the respondents to the EPRI survey on control
center security indicated that their control centers were physically secure. However, recent
invasions and malicious destruction of control center equipment by ex-employees has
demonstrated that procedures used to enforce this security are often missing or ignored.
In addition, a large percentage of the respondents indicated that the garbage of the control center
is not secure and that it is removed by non-bonded services. This allows for the threat of
information leakage through what is commonly called “garbage diving.”
Although measures that block physical access to control centers and control center data are an
important component of a data security program, a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this
report.

Authentication
One of the five types of data security services that the OSI model defines, authentication services
verify the identity of a user or entity and are usually performed when a connection is established.
Access requests to the ICCP server may originate from an individual within the control center or
from an entity at a remote location.
The following services can be used to authenticate individuals seeking to access a network that
uses ICCP:
•

Passwords. Passwords can be required for each host and for individual applications. In a
distributed computing environment, a directory service can provide a single entry point for
all distributed services, avoiding the need for a separate password for each service.

•

Key cards. Key cards are especially useful for challenge-and-response authentication
techniques. Commonly used on EMS operator consoles to gain access, key cards are a more
secure form of individual authentication than usernames/passwords.

•

Biometrics. The next level of individual authentication, biometrics incorporate information
about physical characteristics such as signatures, fingerprints, voiceprints, eye prints.

In some cases, individual authentication procedures involve combinations of these techniques,
incorporating information that you know (e.g., a password) with something you have (e.g., a key
card or physical characteristic).

3-2

Preliminary Solutions

The following services can be used to verify the identity of an entity seeking access to a network
using ICCP:
•

Private key technology or public key technology (i.e., public key infrastructure, PKI).
After ICCP users create a connection and establish an association, these technologies enable
entities to authenticate themselves using a digital certificate issued from a trusted source.

•

UCA 2.0 ACSE. The Utility Communications Architecture (UCA) Version 2.0 profile
document specifies the use of the OSI layer 7 Association Control Service Element (ACSE)
Authentication-value parameter.

Access Control
After authenticating the identity of individuals or entities, the next step in the OSI security model
is access control, which controls what information the users is authorized to access and what
actions the users is permitted to enact (e.g., read, write and/or execute). Alternative mechanisms
to provide access control for individuals include the following:
•

Access control lists. For example, UNIX file systems can restrict access privileges to the
user ID of the owner, a workgroup, or all users, but fall short of the full functionality of
access control lists, which define access privileges for each individual user for each system
resource. Most UNIX vendors offer optional software to provide access control lists.

•

Passwords. Passwords are a form of access control, when used by individual applications
such as EMS consoles.

In addition to access control lists, access control techniques for remote entities include the
following:
•

Bilateral tables. Bilateral tables in ICCP provide limited access control, and must be
coupled with an authentication service when a connection is first established between client
and server.

•

Router. The filtering capability of a router, which can restrict access by address (destination
or source IP address and port for TCP/IP networks), provides another type of access control.
Packet filtering provides a way to build a firewall around a specific network or system. This
technique typically is used internally (e.g., to restrict access to the real-time EMS/SCADA
system from devices not on the real-time EMS LAN). A router can also be used to restrict
external access from the Internet, although a gateway offers better protection.

•

Gateway. Some types of application-level gateways or “proxies” can provide more robust
protection for vital system resources against intentional or inadvertent intrusion. When used
as the link to the Internet, the gateway is configured like a router, except that it appears as an
end system to the Internet. Such a gateway limits the types of TCP connections permitted
from outside the gateway to the control center networks, while permitting more possibilities
for control center personnel to access external systems. A gateway is more secure than a
router, but less convenient for users and has the potential to become a bottleneck due to
lower performance.

3-3

Preliminary Solutions

•

Firewall. Increasingly sophisticated firewalls typically combine most of the data security
features described above and incorporate additional features. A recent EPRI report
recommended the following key capabilities of firewalls in a control center environment:
–

Packet filtering in order to restrict access based on both source and destination IP
addresses

–

Application-layer proxy capability

–

Ability to guard against IP spoofing (i.e., would-be intruder outside the firewall
configures its machine with IP addresses on the internal EMS LAN)

–

Protection against denial-of-service attacks (e.g., by rejecting packets identified as
part of such an attack)

–

Performance of network address translation, enabling the control center to hide IP
addresses used on the internal EMS LAN from external view

–

Comprehensive logging capability to log break-in attempts

–

Notification via pager and/or email when a break-in attempt is detected

–

Remote management

–

Granular management to prevent the attack response from denying communication
services to legitimate users (e.g., both source and destination address-based filtering,
port-based filtering, and protocol-based filtering).

Data Confidentiality
Data confidentiality is concerned with protecting data from unauthorized disclosure. Available
alternatives include the following:
•

Physical protection, such as installing transmission media through conduit or observed areas
to prevent tapping.

•

Security routing, which specifies selected routes for routers to use when routing packets. This
permits the use of only certain links, such as privately owned links, when sending sensitive
data between sites. This feature requires OSI network layer software to accept such routing
information. ICCP uses this feature.

•

Encryption with the DES standard.

Data Integrity
Data integrity services ensure that no modification, insertion, or deletion of data can occur in
either the entire message or in selected fields. Typically this is done at higher layers in the
protocol stack, such as layers 4 or 7. Some protection is provided through standard error
detecting algorithms, such as cyclic redundancy codes (CRC) in layer 2.

SECURING ICCP USING STASE-MMS

Securing MMS
This chapter summarizes a proposed system described in “SISCO 1998” in the bibliography,
currently in review, that defines a new Application Service Element (ASE) called Security
Transformations Application Service Element for MMS (STASE-MMS). Residing between
MMS and the presentation layer in the OSI protocol stack, the proposed system supports data
security services for MMS protocol data units (PDUs, which are packets that contain structured
message content) and MMS objects. The system can, in turn, secure data being communicated
using the ICCP protocol (see Figure 4-1).

Within the application layer, Security Transformations Application Service Element for
MMS (STASE-MMS) resides below MMS, which operates below ICCP (TASE.2).

The proposed system provides an approach for performing security transformations (STs).
Security transformations are used to provide security services such as peer entity authentication,
data origin authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. STs include
encryption, hashing, digital seals, and digital signatures. STASE-MMS makes use of the
Association Control Service Element (ACSE) (layer 7) and adds additional transformation

functions within the Presentation layer (layer 6). Otherwise, no other security enhancements are
required for layers 1 through 5 of the communications stack. STASE-MMS is an implementation
of several options specified by the Generic Upper Layers Security (GULS) standard.
ICCP uses MMS as its messaging service, and STASE-MMS was developed with ICCP in mind.

Supported Security Transformations
STASE-MMS is an application service element that provides the transformations necessary for
secure transfer of MMS PDUs. In addition, STASE-MMS provides a means for exchanging
information regarding the data security being provided. A request from MMS on the transmitting
side invokes STASE-MMS, and STASE-MMS provides an indication to MMS on the receiving
side. Both the request and the indication contain the MMS PDU being protected, as well as
(optionally) information regarding the type of data security being provided.
STASE-MMS protects MMS PDUs by applying selected security transformations to whole
MMS PDUs encoded with the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DERs). STASE-MMS supports
the following STs:
•

Confidential: The DER-encoded MMS PDU is encrypted for privacy protection with a
symmetric key encryption algorithm.

•

Public enciphered: The DER-encoded MMS PDDU is encrypted for privacy protection with
a public key encryption algorithm.

•

Hashed: STASE-MMS computes a hash-based Message Authentication Code (MAC) of the
DER-encoded MMS PDU and a secret password and appends the result to the MMS PDU for
integrity protection.

•

Sealed: STASE-MMS computes the digital seal of the DER-encoded MMS PDU and
appends the result to the MMS PDU for integrity protection.

•

Signed: STASE-MMS computes the digital signature of the DER-encoded MMS PDU and
appends the result to the MMS PDU for non-repudiation protection.

•

Confidential signed: STASE-MMS computes the digital signature of the DER-encoded
MMS PDU and appends the result to the encrypted (see “confidential” above) MMS PDU for
non-repudiation and privacy protection.

•

Confidential hashed: STATE-MMS computes the MAC of the DER-encoded MMS PDU
and appends the result to the encrypted (see “confidential” above) MMS PDU for integrity
and privacy protection.

•

Confidential sealed: STASE-MMS computes the digital seal of the DER-encoded MMS
PDU and appends the result to the encrypted (see “confidential” above) MMS PDU for
integrity and privacy protection.

STASE-MMS can also pass through MMS PDUs in the clear, without encoding or STs.

Default Data Security Algorithms and Mechanisms
Unless otherwise agreed between the communication entities, the following selected default
conventions, data security algorithms, and data security mechanisms are proposed:
•

Default encryption algorithm for symmetric key encryption: the Digital Encryption Standard
(DES) in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.

•

If triple DES is needed: Encryption Decryption Encryption in the CBC outer feedback mode
with three different DES keys.

•

The default public key encryption algorithm: RSA

•

The default hashing algorithm: MD5.

•

The default MAC (for keyed hashing): HMAC.

•

The default seal: the MD5 hash of the DER encoded MMS PDU encrypted with DES.

•

The default digital signature: the MD5 hash of the DER encoded MMS PDU encrypted with
RSA and the user’s private key.

Data Security Information Exchange
The following messages, exchanged between STASE-MMS entities, or between MMS and
STASE-MMS, specify which of the STs listed above is being used to protect the MMS PDU:
•

MMS invokes STASE-MMS on the originating side

•

The originating STASE-MMS sends a STASE-MMS PDU to a peer STASE-MMS entity on
the receiving side

•

STASE-MMS on the receiving side provides an indication to MMS.

Knowledge of which STs are performed is mandatory, but not sufficient for proper
communications. Indeed, both sides need to know which algorithms are being used, as well as
the values of all parameters (e.g., encryption keys, initialization vectors) that are in use. The
proposed STASE-MMS provides several default values and mechanisms that require only the
bare minimum of security-related information exchange. It also provides facilities for negotiating
at association setup time which algorithms will be supported and for changing and specifying
such information dynamically for every MMS PDU.

STASE-MMS Model
In the OSI environment, communication between application processes is represented in terms of
communication between a pair of application entities (AEs) using the presentation service (see
Figure 4-2). Communication between application entities may require secure transfer of
application protocol data units (APDUs).

4-3

Securing ICCP Using STASE-MMS

APDUs sent by one AE (the sender) are received by the other AE (the receiver). Secure transfer
ensures that APDUs transferred by the sender can be correctly verified for integrity, and/or
checked for non-repudiation, and/or understood only by the intended receiver. Secure transfer
involves security transformation (e.g., encryption) of APDUs from the sending application entity
before transferring them and performing the reverse security transformations (e.g., decryption).
STASE-MMS only deals with the secure transfer of the MMS application protocol data units.
Secure transfer is carried out within the context of the application association. An application
association defines the relationship between a pair of AEs, and is formed by the exchange of
application protocol control information through the use of presentation layer services. The AE
that initiates the association is called the association initiating entity, or the association initiator,
while the AE that responds to the initiation of an application association by another AE is called
the application responding AE, or the association responder.
The functionality of an AE is factored into one application process and a set of application
service elements (ASEs). Each ASE may itself be factored into a set of more primitive ASEs.
The interaction between AEs is described in terms of their use of ASEs.
