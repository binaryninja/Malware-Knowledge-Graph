A new malware with strange associations to the Ryuk Ransomware has been discovered to
look for and steal confidential financial, military, and law enforcement files.
While Ryuk Ransomware encrypts a victim's files and then demands a ransom, it is not
known for actually stealing files from an infected computer. A new infection discovered
today by MalwareHunterTeam, does exactly that by searching for sensitive files and
uploading them to a FTP site under the attacker's control.
To make this sample even more interesting, this data exfiltrating malware also contains
some strange references to Ryuk within the code.

Searching for confidential files
In conversations with reverse engineer and security researcher Vitali Kremez, we get an
idea of how the file stealer works. When executed, the stealer will perform a recursive
scan of all the files on a computer and look for Word .docx and Excel .xlsx files to steal.
When looking for files, if it encounters any folders or files that match certain strings, it will
stop checking the file and move to the next one, similar to how ransomware would operate.

A full list of the blacklisted files and folders are at the end of this article, including your
standard ones such as "Windows", "Intel", "Mozilla", "Public", etc.
In addition, it also skips over any files that are associated with Ryuk such as
"RyukReadMe.txt" and files with the ".RYK" extension.

Blacklisted Strings
If the file passes the blacklist, the stealer will then check if it is a .docx or .xlsx file as shown
below.

2/13

Searching for .docx and .xlsx files
When a .docx or .xlsx file is located, the stealer will use libzip and the zip_open and
zip_trace functions to verify if the file is a valid Word or Excel document. It does this by
checking and validating the presence of the word/document.xml (word) or
xl/worksheets/sheet (excel) files in the Office document.

3/13

Verifying Word

Document
If it is a valid file, it will then compare the file's name against a list of 77 strings. All of the
strings are listed at the end of the document and include entries like "marketwired", "10-Q",
"fraud", "hack", "tank", "defence", "military", "checking", "classified", "secret", "clandestine",
undercover", "federal", etc.

Word of

interest
As you can see the actor is looking for confidential military secrets, banking information,
fraud, criminal investigation documents, and other sensitive information.
Strangely, it also looks for files that contain the first names "Emma", "Liam", "Olivia","Noah",
"William", "Isabella", "James", "Sophia", and "Logan". It is suspected that these names
comes from the top baby names of 2018 as listed by the U.S. Social Security department.
Any files that match a string are then uploaded via FTP to the 66.42.76.46/files_server/a85 server as seen in the code below.

5/13

Stealing files by uploading to FTP Server
After scanning the local machine, the malware will then get a list of IP addresses from the
computer's ARP table. It then proceeds to search for files on any available shares.

Getting ARP Table
It is not known how this malware is being installed, but it was theorized by
BleepingComputer, Kremez, and MalwareHunterTeam, that this infection could be run prior
to infecting a machine to harvest interesting files before they are encrypted.

Strange ties to Ryuk Ransomware
6/13

As we already discussed, this stealer purposely skips files associated with the Ryuk
Ransomware such as RyukReadMe.txt, UNIQUE_ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE, and any files
that have the .RYK extension.
In addition, there are code similarities that the stealer and Ryuk Ransomware share in
common. For example, the stealer contains a function that creates a new file and appends
the .RYK extension as if it was encrypting the file. This function is not utilized by the stealer.

Stealer contains Ryuk's create file method
The stealer also checks for the presence of a file named Ahnlab as shown below.

7/13

Stealer searching for Ahnlab
Kremez told BleepingComputer that Ryuk Ransomware also checks for the presence of this
file as shown below.

Ryuk Ransomware searching for Ahnlab
While there are definite ties between this stealer and Ryuk, it is not known if the actually
from the same group or someone gained access to the code and utilized it in their own
program.
8/13

"It might indicate someone with source access to Ryuk ransomware simply copy/pasted and
modified code to make it a stealer or look like it," Kremez told BleepingComputer in a
conversation about this malware.
Furthermore, Ryuk runs without any dependencies when tested by BleepingComputer in
the past, while this stealer appears to be a MingW executable that requires numerous DLLs
to be present in order to properly execute.
This could indicate that the stealer is being installed manually or dropped as a package with
all of the necessary components.
As more samples become available, we will hopefully see its install process in the future.
Update 9/11/19: Added info about the names in the match list.
