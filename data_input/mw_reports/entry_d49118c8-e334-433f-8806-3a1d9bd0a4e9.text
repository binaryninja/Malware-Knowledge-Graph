eSentire Threat Intelligence Malware Analysis: HermeticWiper & PartyTicket
esentire.com/blog/esentire-threat-intelligence-malware-analysis-hermeticwiper-partyticket

Recently, there have been multiple reports of new wiper malware observed targeting Ukrainian organizations as part of cyber warfare
stemming from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. This new wiper malware, also known as HermeticWiper, was first detected in February
2022, and was deployed after a wave of multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched by Russian threat actors against
Ukrainian law enforcement and government agencies.
eSentire’s Threat Intelligence team has performed a technical malware analysis on HermeticWiper and PartyTicket. This technical analysis
provides a detailed breakdown of how HermeticWiper fulfills its objective of accessing the Physical Drives and encrypting the targeted filetypes
in the host device and network.
With the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, it’s probable that threat actors from Russia and Ukraine will leverage new malware in the ongoing
hybrid war and improve their malware development capabilities to evade detections.

Key Takeaways:
HermeticWiper malware is more sophisticated than WhisperGate in terms of implementing third-party drivers to facilitate access to the
Physical Drives as well as modifying its access token to enable interaction with the kernel.
HermeticWiper is abusing legitimate EaseUS partition management drivers to retrieve partition information and destroy data. This shows
development maturity compared to WhisperGate.
The main purpose of the decoy ransomware (PartyTicket, also known as HermeticRansom) is to limit the victim’s interactions with the
infected system.
Due to the poor implementation of the encryption algorithm or the coding error, PartyTicket cannot be considered as a sophisticated
decoy ransomware, but it certainly made more improvements compared to WhisperGate.
The threat actor(s) behind HermeticWiper prevented the possibility of recovery by deleting shadow copies. It’s probable that this was
done to clear logs to avoid detection and attribution.
As a result of this research, we have created an additional 5 detections to reduce the risk of this threat and are performing global threat
hunts for indicators associated with HermeticWiper & Party Ticket malware.

Case Study
The destructive malware dubbed as ‘HermeticWiper’ by SentinelLabs was first detected by researchers at ESET on February 23rd, 2022, at
10am EST. Five hours later, the Cyber Police of Ukraine reported DDoS attacks on several Ukrainian government agencies, including Cabinet
of Ministers of Ukraine, Verkhovna Rada (unicameral parliament of Ukraine), Security Service of Ukraine, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other
Ukrainian government organizations.

1/10

The reports stated that the DDoS attacks had been ongoing since February 15th and linked the attacks, including numerous phishing attempts,
to Russian threat actors. As part of these attacks, HermeticWiper was installed on hundreds of machines in Ukraine, but evidence of
HermeticWiper was also found in Lithuania and Latvia.
On February 27th Ukrainian border control was reported to be infected with HermeticWiper, which prevented refugees from being able to cross
into Romania. Symantec also reported that the ransomware named PartyTicket was dropped on the compromised machines.

Initial Compromise
On February 24-25th researchers at Symantec reported three potential initial vectors of compromise:
1. Ukraine, December 23, 2021 – The abuse of SMB on Microsoft Exchange Servers followed by credential stealing and web shell.
2. Lithuania, November 12, 2021 – Tomcat exploitation followed by the creation of scheduled tasks to gain persistence on the compromised
system.
3. Ukraine, November 11, 2021 – An exploit abusing Microsoft SQL Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2021-1636).

Technical Analysis on HermeticWiper
SHA-256: 0385eeab00e946a302b24a91dea4187c1210597b8e17cd9e2230450f5ece21da
HermeticWiper is a 32-bit executable written in C++ and at 114 KB, it’s over four times bigger than its predecessor, WhisperGate (27 KB).
WhisperGate was also used as a decoy ransomware and destructive malware in January 2022 to target Ukrainian organizations. The compiler
timestamp dates to December 28, 2021. However, it should be noted that the timestamp can be easily modified by the threat actors. The
malware sample was signed by Hermetica Digital Ltd, a Cyprus-based company, and is valid from April 12, 2021 until April 14, 2022 (Exhibit
1). Based on this discovery, eSentire’s Threat Intelligence team has determined it’s probable that the malware was developed in April 2021.

Exhibit 1: HermeticWiper digital signature

The RCDATA resource (the raw data resource of an application) contains 4 drivers: DRV_X64, DRV_X86, DRV_XP_X64, DRV_XP_X86. The
drivers are compressed with SZDD (Haruhiko Okumura's LZSS), a compression algorithm known to be used by Microsoft installation programs
(Exhibit 2).

Exhibit 2: HermeticWiper Resources

The decompressed drivers are signed by Chengdu YIWO Tech Development Co Ltd, the developer of EaseUS (Exhibit 3).

2/10

Exhibit 3: Digital Certificate of the extracted drivers

The implementation of EaseUS partition management driver in the wiper to access the file systems shows an improvement compared to
WhisperGate. The drivers contain the program database (PDB) path, which contains debugging information, to:
d:\epm\_epm_main\mod.windiskaccessdriver\windiskaccessdriver\objfre_wlh_x86\i386\epmntdrv.pdb
This indicates that the attackers abused the legitimate driver epmntdrv.sys developed by EaseUS to facilitate access to the physical drives of
the victim’s machine.
The wiper will choose which driver to plant on the victim’s machine based on the Windows version, which uses major and minor conventions
for its Operating Systems (OS). If the major and minor versions of the OS is greater or equal to 6 and 0 respectively, it will assign the
DRV_X64, DRV_X86 drivers to it. Otherwise, it will assign DRV_XP_X64, DRV_XP_X86 drivers (Exhibit 4).
Please refer to the chart compiled by Microsoft that contains operating system version information for more information.

Exhibit 4: Assigning drivers to the appropriate OS

The wiper then assigns itself the following privileges:
SeLoadDriverPrivilege – enables the user to unload and load device drivers in kernel mode. In our case, this will allow the threat actor
to load the EaseUS drivers used to corrupt and destroy data.
SeBackupPrivilege – provides an attacker with the ability to create system backups and full read permissions without further escalating
the privileges.
A service named after the dropped system driver will be created by the wiper via the CreateServiceW API, which will point to
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\rhdr.sys (Note that the driver’s name will be randomly created with 4 characters). After the service has
successfully started, it will sleep for 1000 milliseconds (about 1 second) and then be marked for deletion, at which point the user cannot
manually delete or stop it.
EPMNTDRV will be pointed to the path of the dropped system driver (Exhibit 5), and will also be used to retrieve the Physical Drive number via
DeviceIoControl API (used to get information about the drive).

Exhibit 5: EPMTDRV pointing to the dropped driver

HermeticWiper initiates a loop that enumerates the Physical Drives to 100, in contrast to WhisperGate’s loop which is repeated up to 199 times
(Exhibit 6). For every enumerated Physical Drive, the wiper will overwrite the first section of the master boot record (MBR) with 512 bytes,
making the machine unbootable upon manual restart.

3/10

Exhibit 6: Drive Enumeration

In addition to the drive enumeration, the wiper also looks for the following folders:
Desktop
My Documents
AppData
C:\Documents and Settings
C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
Windows
Program Files
Program Files(x86)
PerfLogs
Boot
System Volume Information
AppData
Boot and System Volume Information are two important folders that are responsible for Windows operability. Boot folder stores the Boot
Configuration Data (BCD) which contains information about the OS and boot parameters. Without the BCD file, Windows will not be able to
boot. The System Volume Information folder is utilized by the System Restore tool to store the restore points.
The purpose of enumerating the above folders is unclear. It is notable that the threat actors crafted the malware to make sure all the folders
and logs are wiped, and that the victim’s machine remains inoperable if the MBR wiping goes wrong. We believe it’s probable that this was
done to clear logs to avoid detection and attribution.
Next, the crash dump logging is disabled by setting the registry value CrashDumpEnabled to 0 (Exhibit 7).

Exhibit 7: Disabling crash dump by setting the registry key to 0

The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is also disabled via ChangeServiceConfigW API (the API allows to change the service
configurations) through the SERVICE_DISABLED parameter (Exhibit 8).

Exhibit 8: Disabling Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)

The sample also queries for NTFS attribute types and metadata:

4/10

$DATA
$I30
$INDEX_ALLOCATION
$Bitmap (Keeps track of cluster allocation on NTFS volume)
$Logfile (Logs all changes to the file system)
Other attributes such as $REPARSE_POINT and $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM were also found in the .rdata section but were never
referenced by anything. The partition corruption is dependent on whether the system has NTFS or FAT partitions (Exhibit 9).

The ransomware sample is a 64-bit binary written in Golang with a size of 3.14 MB and an empty compilation timestamp. The following
sections in the sample are responsible for determining the filetypes to encrypt, which directories to skip, drive letters to enumerate (Exhibit 10).

Exhibit 10: Sections mentioning “Biden”

As mentioned previously, the function at _C__projects_403forBiden_wHiteHousE_baggageGatherings is enumerating through the drive
letters from A to Z (Exhibit 11).

Exhibit 11: Drive letter enumeration

The function at __C__projects_403forBiden_wHiteHousE_init checks if the OS supports AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions that are
supposed by Windows 7 SP1 and later) and is also responsible for folder and file manipulations as well as getting the time zone data.
The function at _C__projects_403forBiden_wHiteHousE_FileName gets up 55 file extensions and converts them to lower strings (Exhibit
12).

Exhibit 12: Retrieving file extensions

5/10

Approximately 54 file extensions get retrieved from memory for further encryption, not including the encrypted file extension, “.Encryptedjb”
(Exhibit 13).

During the encryption process, the sample writes a ransomware note called “read_me.html” to the victim’s Desktop containing the contact
information (Exhibit 14-15).

Exhibit 14: Creating read_me.html ransomware note

Exhibit 15: Ransomware note (read_me.html)

The ransomware implements AES-GCM encryption for the files (Exhibit 16). An RSA public key is also used to encrypt the AES key, which is
base64-encoded and embedded in the encrypted file. Here is the decoded RSA-OAEP public key with exponent 65537:

6/10

{“N”:25717750538564445875883770450315010157700597087507334907403500443913073702720939931824608270980020206566017538751

Exhibit 16: AES-GCM encryption

The AES key is created with math/rand, which produces a pseudorandom (inevitably, deterministic) sequence of values. That means that the
key can be easily obtained to decrypt the files. During the analysis, we observed the same AES 16-bit key being used to encrypt the file,
“6FBBD7P95OE8UT5QRTTEBIWAR88S74DO”, because the same seed value is being used in the code (Exhibit 17).
All encrypted file names will have the following extension: “.[[email protected]].encryptedJB” and each encrypted file will contain the marker
“ZVL2KH87ORH3OB1J1PO2SBHWJSNFSB4A” at the end.

Exhibit 17: AES key creation using math/rand

During the encryption process, the main executable creates duplicates of itself in the working directory. Each duplicate is named with a GUID
in the format “xxxxxxxx-11ec-xxx-000c29xxxxxx.exe” (Exhibit 18) and will copy itself using the same pattern with a command “cmd /c copy
C:\workdir\xxxxxxxx-xxxx-11ec-xxxx-000c29xxxxxx.exe xxxxxxxx-xxxx-11ec-xxxx-000c29xxxxxx.exe (Exhibit 19).
The duplicated binaries are responsible for encrypting each file on the system, which significantly slows down the infected system. After the
encryption, the binaries are removed from the directory, leaving only 200-300 copies. The encryption process can be easily stopped by
terminating the process tree.

Comparing HermeticWiper, and PartyTicket to WhisperGate
From the technical analysis, we have derived that HermeticWiper is more sophisticated than WhisperGate in terms of implementing third-party
drivers to facilitate access to the Physical Drives and modify its access token to enable interaction with the kernel. Moreover, the threat actor(s)
behind HermeticWiper prevented the possibility of recovery by deleting shadow copies. Although the purpose of enumerating the critical parts
of the OS is still not clear, we believe it’s probable that this was done to clear logs to avoid detection and attribution.
As mentioned previously, PartyTicket has been observed on machines infected with HermeticWiper. The technical analysis of PartyTicket
indicates that the threat actor(s) implemented AES-GCM encryption along with RSA public key for the targeted file extensions, making the
attack look almost like an actual ransomware attempt, whereas WhisperGate decoy ransomware only overwrote the targeted files with 0xCC
bytes and corrupted MBR by overwriting it with a fake ransom note.
PartyTicket, the decoy ransomware, contains political messages based on the strings found mentioning “Biden” and a ransom note saying,
“The only thing that we learned from new elections is we learned nothing from the old!”
HermeticWiper samples have different hashes but the same functionality. WhisperGate has only one known reported hash for the wiper
sample, which likely means that HermeticWiper was able to spread across more machines than WhisperGate.
With the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, it’s probable that threat actors from Russia and Ukraine will leverage new malware and that threat
actors will likely improve their malware development capabilities to evade detection.
