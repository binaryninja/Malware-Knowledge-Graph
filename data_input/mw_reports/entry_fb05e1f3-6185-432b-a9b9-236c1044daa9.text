Necurs Evades Detection via Internet Shortcut File

Necurs, a botnet malware that’s been around since 2012, has been improved with the hopes of
better defeating cybersecurity measures — it was seen to evolve its second layer of infection
using a .URL file (with remote script downloaders detected by Trend Micro as MAL_CERBERJS03D, MAL_NEMUCOD-JS21B, VBS_SCARAB.SMJS02, and MAL_SCARAB-VBS30.
Necurs, a modular malware with variants that are capable of spam distribution, information theft,
and disabling security services and elements, has been around since 2012, propagating in the
wild via the Necurs botnet. In 2017, it pushed Locky — a ransomware family with one variant that
was notable for being distributed via 23 million emails in just 24 hours — via a URL-only spam
email campaign. Last year, we also saw how Necurs pushed double-zipped attachments that
either contained JavaScript, Visual Basic scripts, or macro files with the capability to download its
final payload. In an attempt to evade spam detection through its attachments, Necurs used
archives that included .ZIP files to disguise the script downloader, which was later enclosed in
another .ZIP to hide itself.
The Necurs Transformation: The .URL File Layer
Necurs is indeed constantly evolving to find other effective measures of tricking victims while
defeating countermeasures waged against it. And since it has a highly effective botnet
component that may also be sold as a service, malicious actors will continue to find ways to
circumvent detection and improve how they trick the weakest link in cybersecurity — the user. As

security vendors are wise to Necurs’s traditional infection chain (a script, a macro, or archives
containing certain file formats), the malware has started using an internet shortcut or .URL file to
bypass detection.

Internet shortcuts, or .URLs, take the form of clickable icons and are objects used to access
internet sites or web documents faster. Internet shortcuts have contents that are in the INI file
format, which allows the changing of icons. Necurs malware uses this to its advantage by
changing the folder icon to trick the victim into thinking that it’s a different file type, as it is less
suspicious than clicking on a script. The .URL will then access the remote resource that
downloads another downloader. The second downloader remotely executes the payload.

Notice that aside from the icons disguised as folders, the filenames were also crafted to resemble
typical folder names such as IMG-20180404-9AC4DD, SCN-20180404-268CC1, and PIC20180404-ADEEEE shown in Figure 2, to name a few.

Furthermore, the actual attachment archive does not contain the script downloader Necurs uses
to download its payload. The .URL file accesses the remote server, which then executes through
the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol — a tactic that may be successful in evading certain
spam filters.

The malware doesn’t stop at disguising .URL files. The latest Necurs variant no longer has the
actual script downloader in its attachment. It only contains the internet shortcut to the remote site
that contains the script that is then executed remotely. This means that it does not “download” the
actual script on the victim’s machine. This is the closest it gets to its previous malicious spam
runs: Attaching a URL in the email and tricking a victim into clicking on the link to download a
malicious file.

Interestingly, Necurs does not infect computers using Russian as a language.
Further Evolution: Using QUANTLOADER
Previously, Necurs’s JavaScript downloader downloads the final payload. But in its latest iteration,
the remote script downloads QUANTLOADER (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_QUANT) – a
different downloader – which then downloads the final payload. This is another layer added to
Necurs’s infection chain. The use of QUANTLOADER may be twofold: First, it adds another
download stage before it downloads the final payload, possibly to mix things up and evade
behavioral detections. Secondly, QUANTLOADER is persistent in nature — it drops a copy of
itself and creates an autorun registry so that it executes at startup.
