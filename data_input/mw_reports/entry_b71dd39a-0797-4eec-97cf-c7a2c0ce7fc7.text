On February 24th, the Avast Threat Labs discovered a new ransomware strain
accompanying the data wiper HermeticWiper malware, which our colleagues at ESET
found circulating in the Ukraine. Following this naming convention, we opted to name the
strain we found piggybacking on the wiper, HermeticRansom. According to analysis done
byCrowdstrike’s Intelligence Team, the ransomware contains a weakness in the crypto
schema and can be decrypted for free.

The ransomware is written in GO language. When executed, it searches local drives and
network shares for potentially valuable files, looking for files with one of the extensions
listed below (the order is taken from the sample):
.docx .doc .dot .odt .pdf .xls .xlsx .rtf .ppt .pptx .one.xps .pub .vsd
.txt .jpg .jpeg .bmp .ico .png .gif .sql.xml .pgsql .zip .rar .exe .msi
.vdi .ova .avi .dip .epub.iso .sfx .inc .contact .url .mp3 .wmv .wma .wtv
.avi .acl.cfg .chm .crt .css .dat .dll .cab .htm .html .encryptedjb

In order to keep the victim’s PC operational, the ransomware avoids encrypting files in
Program Files and Windows folders.
For every file designated for encryption, the ransomware creates a 32-byte encryption key.
Files are encrypted by blocks, each block has 1048576 ( 0x100000 ) bytes. A maximum
of nine blocks are encrypted. Any data past 9437184 bytes ( 0x900000 ) is left in plain

text. Each block is encrypted by AES GCM symmetric cipher. After data encryption, the
ransomware appends a file tail, containing the RSA-2048 encrypted file key. The public
key is stored in the binary as a Base64 encoded string:

Encrypted file names are given extra suffix:
.[vote2024forjb@protonmail.com].encryptedJB

When done, a file named “ read_me.html ” is saved to the user’s Desktop folder:

There is an interesting amount of politically oriented strings in the ransomware binary. In
addition to the file extension, referring to the re-election of Joe Biden in 2024, there is also a
reference to him in the project name:

During the execution, the ransomware creates a large amount of child processes, that do
the actual encryption:

1. On the final wizard page, you can opt-in whether you want to backup encrypted files.
These backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process. This
option is turned on by default, which we recommend. After clicking “ Decrypt ”, the
