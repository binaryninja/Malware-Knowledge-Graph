Welcome from the NCCIC and ICS-CERT
The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the Industrial
Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) are pleased to provide our critical infrastructure (CI) partners with the FY 2015 NCCIC/ICS-CERT Industrial Control Systems
Assessment Summary Report.
The NCCIC spearheads the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) efforts to prevent, protect
against, mitigate, and respond to cyber and communications disruptions to CI. The NCCIC serves as a
national hub for cyber and communications information sharing, in near-real-time whenever possible,
and provides assistance to respond to incidents on stakeholder assets. These activities fall under the
“Information Sharing” and “Incident Response” lines of effort outlined in the Office of Cybersecurity
and Communications (CS&C) Implementation Strategy for FY16-18. Within the NCCIC, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) leads DHS efforts to enhance the
cybersecurity and resilience of the industrial control systems (ICSs) upon which much of the Nation’s
CI relies. In partnership with the ICS community, ICS-CERT provides unique analytical, technical,
and information products to help CI owners and operators proactively enhance their control systems
cybersecurity posture and incident response capabilities to limit the severity of incidents.
This report provides a year-end summary of the NCCIC/ICS-CERT security assessment activities.
Security assessments are essential to helping CI owners and operators proactively understand their
vulnerability to cyber threats and measure their ICS security posture against accepted industry standards. This work directly supports the “Leading Practices and Risk Management” line of effort reflected in the CS&C Implementation Strategy for FY16-18 which includes performing risk assessments
with CI organizations to help organizations improve their own security, establish a relationship with
companies, and provide DHS with a better understanding of sector-specific and national risk.
The report provides our partners with common cybersecurity findings and identifies weaknesses
from assessments conducted in FY 2015. In addition, this report outlines risk mitigation actions that
ICS users should consider when addressing control systems cybersecurity in their organizations.
ICS-CERT will continue to share analytical reports to assist CI owners and operators with managing control systems risk. We hope our partners find the information contained in this report useful.
Thank you.

1. INTRODUCTION
The FY 2015 NCCIC/ICS-CERT Industrial Control Systems Assessment Summary Report
identifies common control systems cyber-weaknesses, provides risk mitigation recommendations,
and provides a broader strategic analysis of the evolving ICS cybersecurity landscape. Reporting
periods for assessment data spans the Federal fiscal year (October-September).
As the cyber-threat landscape continues to

processes that support our Nation’s CI. From the
launch of the ICS-CERT assessment program in
FY 2009 through the end of FY 2015, ICS-CERT conducted roughly 535 assessments for government and private sector CI owners and operators. Cybersecurity assessments help CI partners to
understand their ICS security strengths and weaknesses and help guide decisions to enhance their
cybersecurity posture.
In FY 2014, ICS-CERT issued the first ICS Assessment summary report. Many of the critical
weaknesses identified in FY 2014 remained prominent in FY 2015. ICS-CERT draws the vulnerability-specific data contained in the summary report from its Design Architecture Review (DAR) and
Network Architecture Validation and Verification (NAVV) assessments. These are deep dive ICS
assessments conducted in close partnership with CI facility owners and operators. ICS-CERT also
maintains the Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET®), available as both a facilitated assessment and a
downloadable self-assessment product. ICS-CERT does not retain data from CSET assessments.
The discoveries and mitigation recommendations described in the summary report are not all-inclusive or prescriptive. Summary report information should be reviewed and applied to an organization’s overall cybersecurity framework and program as appropriate to that organization. Addressing
the best practices and recommendations in this report can improve a CI asset owner’s overall security
posture and heighten awareness of potential threats or cyber attacks targeting their operations.
2015 Assessment Snapshot
• ICS-CERT conducted 112 assessments in FY 2015, including 38 facilitated CSET®, 46
DAR, and 28 NAVV assessments.
• There were 638 weaknesses identified through DAR and NAVV assessments.
• The top six categories represented 36 percent of all weaknesses.
• Boundary protection was the most commonly identified area of weakness in both FY
2014 and FY 2015.
• Weaknesses related to boundary protection and least functionality represented 21 percent of all discovered weaknesses.
• Key trends included pervasive issues related to virtual machines, remote access, virtual local area network (VLAN) use, bring your own device (BYOD) risks, use of cloud
services, and ICS network monitoring.

2. SUMMARY FINDINGS
2.1 Assessment Activity
As shown in Figure 1, ICS-CERT conducted 112 assessments in FY 2015. Demand for ICSCERT assessment products continues to increase, particularly for in-depth assessment products:
the DAR and NAVV assessments. This increase in demand is in part due to growing awareness of
ICS-CERT’s assessment capabilities and in part due to increased awareness among CI partners of
the importance of understanding and improving their ICS cybersecurity posture.

FY 2015 Top Vulnerabilities

ICS-CERT assessments uncovered 638 weaknesses in FY 2015. The top six areas of weakness accounted for approximately 36 percent of all weaknesses identified in FY 2015 assessments, as shown in Table 2.
Table 2. Top Six Weaknesses Discovered in FY 2015.

Area of Weakness

Consequence/Risk

Boundary Protection

• Cannot detect unauthorized activity in critical systems.
• Increased risk to critical assets with weak boundaries between ICS
and Enterprise networks.

Least Functionality

• Creates vectors for malicious party access to critical systems.
• Rogue internal access could be established.

Authenticator Management

• Unsecured password communications can easily be compromised.
• Password compromise could allow trusted unauthorized access to
systems.

Identification and
Authentication

• Results in lack of accountability and traceability for user actions if
an account is compromised.
• Increases difficulty in securing accounts as personnel leave the organization, especially sensitive for users with administrator access.

Least Privilege

• The more authorized users with elevated privileges, the larger the
attack surface for an intruder to steal account credentials with
elevated access rights to access and compromise critical systems.

Allocation of Resources

• Understaffing impedes organizational cybersecurity monitoring and
response capability to a critical system cyber incident increasing
the potential impact to the company.

The most common ICS cyber weakness in both FY 2014 and FY 2015 was insufficient network boundary protection. Monitoring and control of communications at the ICS network boundaries is a key tenet of the cybersecurity defense-in-depth concept. Boundary protection effectively slows attack processes and facilitates detection, analysis, and notification of unauthorized
activity to support operational and incident response. Absent strong protection, attackers can
more easily penetrate the network boundary around critical assets, access valuable information,
and manipulate systems controlled by ICS. VulBoundary Protection
nerabilities related to least functionality were the
second most commonly identified concern. Spe• In both FY 2014 and FY 2015,

Table 3 compares the top six weaknesses discovered in FY 2014 to those discovered in
FY 2015 (italics indicates that the weakness appeared in the top six for both years). Boundary
protection continued to present the most common weakness discovered across both years, representing roughly 13 percent of all discovered weaknesses in FY 2015 and 11 percent in FY 2014.
Boundary protection was identified as a weakness in 63 percent of the DAR assessments performed in 2015.

3. DETAILED ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In FY 2015, ICS-CERT provided mitigation recommendations for 638 weaknesses identified
through 74 DAR and NAVV assessments. ICS-CERT’s assessment methodology categorizes
weaknesses based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) NIST 800-53
control family subcategories (See Appendix A for Control Family descriptions). The Top 20 categories of weaknesses make up 69.4 percent of the total weaknesses identified. Table 4 shows the
Top 20 weakness categories discovered in 2015. Appendix B provides brief descriptions of each
category.

Top 6
Discoveries

3.1 Top Six Discoveries: Risks and Recommended Mitigation
While ICS-CERT assessments identified weaknesses across all control families, six categories were most prevalent, representing 35.8 percent of the total vulnerabilities discovered across
assessed CI sectors. The top six categories were: Boundary Protection, Least Functionality,
Authenticator Management, Identification and Authentication, Least Privilege, and Allocation of
Resources. Table 5 summarizes the six most common vulnerabilities by security control family,
subcategory, potential risk, and recommended mitigations.

Table 5. Top Six Discoveries: Risks and Recommended Mitigation.

1. System and Communications Protection: Boundary Protection (SC-7)
85 Discoveries
Description
• Controls associated with the monitoring and control of communications at the ICS
external electronic boundaries and key internal boundaries, the implementation of
subnetworks to separate critical systems, and the implementation of managed protective interfaces for external connectivity to critical systems.
Concerns if Not Mitigated
• Without adequate boundary protections for the ICS network, it becomes difficult
to detect unauthorized activity. Weak boundary protection provides various vectors
for unauthorized interfacing with devices and systems, which directly support the
control process.
• The scope of threats and general risk to control systems operations increases significantly without logical separation of the ICS network from enterprise networks
(or from untrusted systems, i.e., the Internet).
Recommended Mitigation
• Separate the enterprise network from the ICS network and establish a demilitarized
zone (DMZ) between the two systems for ICS perimeter protection. Refer to NIST
800-SP 82 Chapter 5 for information on designing perimeter protections for an ICS.
• The DMZ should house a dedicated “jump” server that would permit systems on
the enterprise network (or those accessing via a remote method, e.g., a virtual private network [VPN]) to access data elements derived from the ICS network.
• The jump server should be hardened, running only essential services. Credentials
for this server should not be the same as those that are used for authentication to
systems on the enterprise network.
• Ingress/Egress communication flows to this server should be restricted to the minimal subset of those that are required to support secure methods for accessing ICS
systems (when needed to access from outside the standard ICS network).
• Logging and monitoring of information derived from this system should be incorporated with continued verification.
• Security devices and systems need to be resident in the DMZ to support ICS system
network equipment patching and updates (antivirus update server, Windows Server
Update Services [WSUS] patch update, etc.).

6

2. Configuration Management: Least Functionality (CM-7)
46 Discoveries
Description
• Controls associated with minimizing the computing resources of systems functions,
ports, protocols, and services to only those required to support system essential
operations.
Concerns if Not Mitigated
• Unnecessary services, ports, protocols, applications, and functions create vectors
for malicious parties to gain access to the ICS.
• Unauthorized personnel could plug rogue devices into open ports (or unplug an
authorized device and connect) to gain access to the network.
Recommended Mitigation
• Determine the necessary operational requirements, services, ports, protocols, and
applications to complete the needed function of each system component. Restrict
the component to allow only the use of the necessary requirements.
• Use available hardening guidelines and vendor operational requirements to determine the settings that allow the necessary system functionality and document
exceptions.

3. Identification and Authentication: Authenticator Management (IA-5)
27 Discoveries
Description
• Controls associated with the management of system authenticators. Often ICSs or
operations control centers either don’t support strong password management or
operational implementation of individual passwords is not appropriate to the operating environment.
Concerns if Not Mitigated
• Passwords verify the authenticity of a user. If a password is compromised, the system assumes the user is an authorized party.
• Passwords can be easily compromised using techniques such as brute force (password guessing) or pass the hash techniques.
• If encryption is not enabled on authentication, meaning password data are transferred as clear text, attackers can simply listen to the traffic and pull the user name
and passwords off the wire while in transit. Once compromised, persistent access is
granted for the lifetime of the user accounts and passwords (i.e., account passwords
that never expire or inactive/legacy accounts that are not disabled when not in use).

7

Recommended Mitigation
• Establish and enforce a password policy. Protect those passwords via encryption.
This policy should require the use of strong passwords and the periodic change of
those passwords.
• Implement additional requirements for remote access connections to verify the
authenticity of parties requesting access remotely. Multi-factor authentication is
typically seen as two or more of the following; something known (password),
something possessed (RSA token or public key infrastructure [PKI] certificate), and
something a user is (i.e., biometrics; such as a voice print).

4. Identification and Authentication: Identification and Authentication (IA-2)
25 Discoveries
Description
• Controls implemented for the identification and authentication of authorized organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).
Concerns if Not Mitigated
• Lack of accountability for individual user actions.
• Shared accounts decrease nonrepudiation, which reduces accountability and traceability if an account is compromised.
• This practice also makes it more difficult to secure accounts when someone leaves
the organization, especially if there are no policies and procedures to have accounts
and passwords changed when an administrator leaves the organization.
Recommended Mitigation
• Establish individual user accounts where possible and document the use of shared
accounts.
• All system administrators and users should have their own unique accounts. Where
applicable, system administrator accounts should be integrated with active directory
(AD).
• Where group user accounts are used, such as in an ICS control center environment,
additional methods of accountability should be used, such as access key cards, log
books, etc.

8

5. Access Control: Least Privilege (AC-6)
23 Discoveries
Description
• Controls established to limit access for authorized users and the processes used by
them to only those that are necessary to accomplish their assigned tasks.
Concerns if Not Mitigated
• An attacker or malicious insider can leverage user and computer accounts to potentially gain access to the ICS.
• Assigning elevated or enhanced privileges to personnel above and beyond what
they may require for their job functions introduces risk and provides a means for
either intentional (malicious insider/outsider) or unintentional (accidental) consequences.
• Common vulnerabilities associated with the use of unnecessary privileges include
the unauthorized installation of unapproved or untested software, the execution
of malware or malicious application on a critical asset, or access rights to disable
security features and controls (antivirus, host-based firewall) or modify application
permissions or configuration settings.
Recommended Mitigation
• Enforce the concept of least privilege on all systems. Users that need elevated
privileges should have accounts that allow privileges based on the work they are
performing, using elevated privileges only when required.
• Work with the vendor to investigate methods to run and access supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) applications without the need of utilizing administrative/root level privileges on local systems.

9

6. System and Services Acquisition: Allocation of Resources (SA-2)
23 Discoveries
Description
• Organizational support for the sustainment of security resources, equipment, and
personnel. Often the weakness was identified due to concerns by staff of having the
right skills, training, and number of personnel needed to implement security measures and sustain the operational needs to maintain security operations.
Concerns if Not Mitigated
• Understaffing impedes the ability to respond to cybersecurity issues and events
and impacts efficient maintenance of systems. Understaffed operations efforts are
typically spent addressing day-to-day operational issues, and if time permits, the
regular maintenance operations. Little time is generally available for staff to improve the systems security posture.
Recommended Mitigation
• As your organization establishes its risk appetite, evaluate the cost/benefit of hiring staff to allow for regular maintenance operations, and allow adequate time to
implement proactive security measures (for example, reviewing logs, hardening
networks, and testing upgrades and security patches).

4. OVERARCHING STRATEGIC OBSERVATIONS FROM FY 2015
Meeting with industry and government organizations provides the opportunity to not only
share what ICS-CERT found at specific facilities, but also to see shifts in technology use in
control systems operational and security environments. In FY 2015, ICS-CERT saw significant
changes in the application of various technologies and corresponding challenges in implementing them securely. These include challenges related to use of virtual machines, remote access,
VLANs, BYOD policies, cloud services, and network monitoring.

4.1 Inadequate Access Security Controls for Virtual Machines
Increasingly, CI asset owners are implementing and leveraging virtual machine (VM) technologies as a method of reducing capital equipment, managing device recovery, and running
multiple disparate guest operating systems on a single physical host machine. ICS-CERT continues to see inadequate user access security controls to the hypervisor (VM monitor) host management interface with many of these implementations. This provides a single point of failure and
entry that adversaries could use to control every guest VM on the host computer. These interfaces
should be placed within management networks with strict and logged zone access control. This
ensures that network, host, and VMs are provided with adequate security controls. When CI owners and operators configure the physical host to contain both DMZ and ICS servers, the networks
and network interface controls (NIC) should be hardened, and all others deleted to prevent the
possibility of opening up a bridged scenario. It is also imperative that operational technology
(OT) and information technology (IT) departments coordinate regular patching of the hypervisors
to minimize impact to ICS processors.

4.2 Insecure Implementation of Remote Access
Use of remote access — while not a new concept — raises a number of issues that managers should consider prior to documenting a policy and implementing a process. Whether access
is from the corporate network to the ICS or from the Internet to the ICS, this access provides a
serious risk to the system. Attackers can gain access to user accounts at the users’ home or corporate office and obtain the user credentials and connection to access critical ICS assets or allow
an infected computer an access channel into the networks via a VPN connection. The organization must therefore decide what, if any, access it will require from these remote locations, who
needs that access, and how to harden the access process to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
The use of multi-factor authentication and limiting VPN access to hardened and monitored jump
servers can reduce these risks.

4.3 Improper Use of VLAN
VLAN technology has been around for a long time; in fact, implementing VLANs as security
mechanisms is a standard practice in many configurations. While VLANs can logically segment
networks, if users do not follow best practices of the hardware vendors, network activity can traverse to other VLAN segments. Default and native VLANs that remain unchanged on trunk ports
provide an avenue where jumping from one VLAN to another is possible.

11

4.4 Risk of Bring-Your-Own-Device Policies to ICS
Operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel are increasingly implementing portable
computing devices—such as tablets, smart phones, and laptops—in ICS environments. A number
of organizations are actively promoting their use because of their popularity and convenience
of mobility while maintaining access. However, such devices are not typically managed by the
organization and security policies implemented by the organization are often not also implemented on the portable devices. Use of BYODs to access personal email, web pages, and social media
applications, are inherently high risk to ICS. This risk must be considered by the organization and
appropriate measures, such as mobile device management systems, should be put into place to
mitigate the risk to acceptable levels.

4.5 Cloud Services: Harden External Hosting Security for Critical Functions
ICS-CERT is seeing some organizations utilizing cloud services for data storage and considering methods of utilizing them for additional services to support their ICS architectures.
Organizations must ensure that the parts of any ICS architecture hosted externally have a level
of security consistent with the criticality of the functions of the ICS operation. Organizations
must also consider ICS operational information integrity, security, and confidentiality, as well as
functional and operational details associated with recovery, event/incident management, failover,
forensic support, monitoring, and other operational sequences that require special support by the
cloud-hosting service provider. Legal instruments, such as service level agreements, are important because all operational support should be explicitly identified. This ensures that support by
cloud service providers — and Internet service provider (ISP) availability and bandwidth capacity — are sufficient to manage any operational issues that may surface. Issues that are sometime
overlooked when shifting resources to the cloud include reliance on ISP connections on premise
and the corresponding potential of bandwidth increases. The effects of load balancing and effects
associated with an upsurge in data usage by other ISP customers should also be considered.

4.6 ICS Network Monitoring as a Core Defense-in-Depth Strategy
The concept of Defense-in-Depth (DiD) is premised on early detection and alerts of an intrusion to ensure defensive action can be taken before the breach of critical assets. Network monitoring is an absolute requirement for any critical system. Having an electronic boundary around
the ICS is not sufficient to protect critical assets from unauthorized access. For each protection
in a network environment, attackers can find a method to overcome that protection. Most CI
organizations have some level of monitoring at the corporate level, but this is rarely implemented
within the ICS networks. Network monitoring can be done and collected in many ways, such as
using free centralized syslog servers for Linux and network devices to centrally collect Windows
Events using winrm and wevtutil utilities, but these events (logs) must also be reviewed. Solutions such as security information and event management (SIEM) products exist that can collect,
log, and correlate information from multiple sources and alert on anomalous or specified activity
and provide real-time analysis. Technologies for monitoring include log collection and management to windows hosts with free utilities such as the Microsoft wevtutil utility and local logs on
firewalls. Canaries and honeypots/honeynets are other concepts that flag any unauthorized intrusion to sophisticated SIEM products and services, combining security information management
and security event management.

5. ABOUT ICS-CERT’S ASSESSMENT OFFERINGS
ICS-CERT offers cybersecurity assessments of ICS to government and private sector CI
organizations across all 16 CI sectors. In FY 2015, ICS-CERT conducted assessments (including CSET, DAR, and NAVV assessments) in the Chemical, Defense Industrial Base, Emergency
Services, Energy, Government Facilities, Information Technology, Transportation, and Water
Sectors. Figure 2 provides a percentage breakout of all FY 2015 assessments by CI sector.
Emergency Services (9 percent)
Defense Industrial Base (3 percent)
Chemical (2 percent)

Water (35 percent)
Energy (29 percent)

Transportation (8 percent)
Information Technology (3 percent)
Government Facilities (11 percent)

Figure 2. CI Sectors Assessed in FY 2015 (includes CSET, DAR, and NAVV Assessments).

The types of organizations
for which ICS-CERT conducts
assessments vary greatly, ranging
from small organizations that
have never completed a cybersecurity evaluation of their control
systems to large multinational
corporations. Data collected
during assessments is anonymized and used for trend and
other analyses.

Working with CI Partners
• CI owners and operators request ICS cybersecurity
assessments on a voluntary basis.
• ICS-CERT prioritizes assessments resources based
on factors such as CI sector risk profile, specific
threat information, and the dependence of specific
CI sectors on control systems.
• The number of assessments in any given sector and
geographic region fluctuate from year to year, based
on the current threat landscape and other factors.

13

ICS-CERT provides three primary assessment services:
1. Cybersecurity Evaluation using CSET
2. DAR

3. NAVV.

ICS-CERT uses NIST’s Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
(NIST 800-53) to group and analyze weaknesses discovered during assessments. NIST 800-53
control family mappings provide a consistent and repeatable methodology for collecting and correlating data to analyze and trend key discoveries at a holistic level.
NIST Special Publication 800-82,
“Guide to Industrial Control Systems
(ICS) Security,” implements an ICS
overlay to NIST 800-53, tailoring security guidance to the unique ICS operational
and system characteristics. While NIST
Special Publication 800-82 applies generally to all CI control systems, ICS-CERT
can work with sector stakeholders to
provide additional tailoring to unique aspects of individual sectors, as necessary.
Appendix A shows the top-level NIST
800-53 Security Control Families.a

Requesting An Assessment
• ICS-CERT assessments are available at no
cost to CI asset owners and operators.
• ICS-CERT provides an in-depth post-assessment report to the asset owner, describing
key discoveries and risk mitigation options
for enhancing ICS cybersecurity.
• Information shared with ICS-CERT can
be protected by DHS as Protected Critical
Infrastructure Information (PCII).

5.1 Cyber Security Evaluation Tool Assessments
DHS developed CSET to support a basic evaluation of cybersecurity posture based on standards and practices best suited to their sector. CSET is available as a downloadable software
product to support user self-assessments as well as a facilitated assessment service. Figure 3

To maximize the effectiveness of the CSET evaluation process, the asset owner should include subject matter experts from various disciplines to conduct the guided discovery-oriented
evaluation of the entity’s underlying control processes, procedures, policies, methodologies, and
protective and detective security controls.

5.2 Design Architecture Review
A DAR is an assessment facilitated by ICS-CERT assessment personnel. ICS-CERT works
with the system owners and operators to perform a deep-dive manual assessment and analysis
of the operational process. The assessment focus is of the underlying ICS network architecture,
integration of IT and OT teams, vendor support, monitoring, cybersecurity controls, and a review
of internal and external connections utilized within the control systems environment. The DAR
focuses heavily on ICS network architecture, asset inventory, and protective and detective security controls.
A DAR provides the asset owner
with a thorough evaluation of system
interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and
mitigation options. It examines information related to key ICS external
connections and includes an in-depth
review of control systems design documents, drawings, and architectures.
ICS-CERT provides a detailed final
report to the user that captures the key
discoveries identified by the team and
provides potential impact and recommended mitigations for each.

• ICS-CERT conducts follow-up meetings with
each asset owner to review the impact of the
assessment findings.
• Follow-up meetings identify each site’s plans
and progress in mitigating identified areas of
weakness.
• Asset owners make risk management decisions
based on a variety of factors, including risk appetite, cost of mitigation strategies, feasibility,
and ease of implementation.

5.3 Network Architecture Validation and Verification
The NAVV assessment entails the analysis of network traffic (passively captured) within
the ICS network. ICS-CERT visualizes and performs analysis on the network traffic and device-to-device communications occurring within various ICS network segments to identify potential unauthorized or suspect communications. Threat data analysis of the traffic evaluates for
indicators of known unauthorized attacks in the user’s network. NAVV assessments enable asset
owners to:
• Verify the accuracy of ICS network diagrams.
• Identify potentially rogue/misconfigured devices or malicious data communications.
• Analyze data flows to ensure boundary protection devices work as designed.
• Identify opportunities or areas to improve zoning and perimeter protections.
• Baseline the ICS network (including a protocol hierarchy and organization of network
traffic).
• Gain practical knowledge of how to passively monitor and verify the communications
occurring within their ICS networks.
The NAVV provides organizations with a view of network communication occurring within
the ICS network infrastructure, in addition to those communications sourced from or destined to
ICS network segments. ICS-CERT typically provides NAVV reviews as an extension to DARs,
although this service is also offered independently.

6. CONCLUSION
The protection of the Nation’s CI is essential for ensuring public confidence and safeguarding
the Nation’s safety, prosperity, and well-being. Much of our CI depends on automated control
systems to manage industrial processes efficiently and securely, so it is essential that organizations conduct security assessments, so that they can understand how best to secure this architecture against cyber threats.
ICS-CERT will continue to improve its cybersecurity assessment services to meet the evolving needs of its CI customer base. ICS-CERT’s assessment capabilities are a key part of a holistic
cyber risk management program that helps CI stakeholders to better prepare for, protect against,
mitigate, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents affecting ICS.
Over the coming years ICS-CERT will launch a number of new initiatives to expand access to
assessment products and services, while continuously improving the quality of service offerings
and the utility of mitigation recommendations. Future initiatives include, for example, launching
train-the-trainer programs to enable DHS regional personnel to conduct CSET assessments for
local customers. In addition, ICS-CERT will be instrumental in supporting assessments focused
on federal facility building and access control systems. Understanding cyber risk is the first step
in mitigating it. ICS-CERT remains committed to helping its partners gain a clearer comprehension of the threats and vulnerabilities they face and the actions they can take to secure their ICS.

Appendix A
NIST 800-53 Security Control Family Descriptions
ICS-CERT uses NIST’s “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems”
(NIST 800-53) to categorize the discoveries found during assessments. Using NIST 800-53 provides a consistent and repeatable methodology for collecting and correlating data.
The NIST 800-53 controls are organized into 18 families; each family contains subcategories
related to the general security topic of the family. Subcategories include, for example, policy,
oversight, supervision, manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms implemented by system technologies. Descriptions of the 18 security control families follow:
Access Control (AC). The security controls governing the mechanisms, principles, processes, and other
controls used to facilitate access to the information system.

Awareness and Training (AT). The security controls facilitating general and role-based security
training of users in regard to the information system and the corresponding records of training.
Audit and Accountability (AU). The security controls used to define, record, analyze, and report
on the actions of the information system.
Security Assessment and Authorization (CA). Security controls that define and establish how the
information system will authorize for use, how the information system is checked to ensure that security
controls are in place and deficiencies are tracked and corrected, and how the system is connected to
external systems as well as its internal connections.

Configuration Management (CM). Security controls to manage the installation and configuration of the information system as a whole and per device. These controls establish documentation, planning, configuration, testing, and analysis of the hardware and software changes made to
the information system.
Contingency Planning (CP). Security controls to define and aid in the recovery/restoration processes of an information system.
Identification and Authentication (IA). The controls to verify the identity of a user, process, or
device through the use of specific credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens, biometrics) as a prerequisite for granting access to resources in an IT system.
Incident Response (IR). Security controls pertaining to incident response training, testing, handling, monitoring, reporting, and support services.
Maintenance (MA). Security controls governing the maintenance processes and tools.
Media Protection (MP). Security controls ensuring access to, marking, storage, and sanitization
of media both electronic and physical.
Physical and Environmental Protection (PE). Security controls addressing the physical security
and needs of an information system including environmental controls for conditioning (e.g., temperature,
humidity) and emergency provisions (e.g., shutdown, power, lighting, and fire protection).

18

Planning (PL). Security Controls comprising the security plan, security architecture, rules of
behavior, and operations of the information system.
Personnel Security (PS). Security controls dealing with the security implications of information
system personnel.
Risk Assessment (RA). Security controls to determine the risk of the information system. The
control family includes the assessment of risk and scanning the system for vulnerabilities.
System and Services Acquisition (SA). Security controls that pertain to the establishment and
operations of the information system, including its resources, development, and life cycle.
System and Communications Protection (SC). Security controls to protect the information
system and its data as they are dispersed through the various channels of communication.
System and Information Integrity (SI). Security controls to ensure information system data are
valid and authentic. Control family includes controls to address flaws in the system, malicious
code, and error handling.
Program Management (PM). Provides enterprise-level security controls reaching across an
entire organization.
