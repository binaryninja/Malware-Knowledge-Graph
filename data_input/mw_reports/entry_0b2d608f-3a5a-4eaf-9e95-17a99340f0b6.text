January 5, 2021

In November last year, there was a case that shocked not only the security industry, but also
all of the Korean industries. The system of E-Land Group, the distribution giant, was
infected by the ‘CLOP Ransomware.’ According to the press report that quoted an associate
of the company, over half of the brick-and-mortar stores were affected by the ransomware,
leading to disruption of business. This incident showed that the ransomware attacks can
occur regardless of company size, and Korean industries must now face such threats that
made themselves tangible.
AhnLab, the leader of the Korean security industry, published an in-depth analysis report of
CLOP Ransomware’s distribution path, whether infected PCs can be restored, course of the
attack, and trend of change. This paper will briefly examine the content of the report.

Before discussing the case of attack against E-Land, the CLOP Ransomware must be analyzed as
having knowledge on CLOP Ransomware’s attack process and trend of change can help
understand the case better.
Target of CLOP Ransomware Attack and Process
Attack Target
CLOP Ransomware targeted companies that operate Active Directory (AD). AD is more commonly
used by companies than individual users as it allows companies to manage multiple Windows
systems efficiently via centralized management. The attacker abused this advantage to steal AD
server administrator privilege and attacked various systems within companies.
AhnLab estimates that in 2019, 369 companies and 13,497 systems (PC and server) suffered
damage due to CLOP Ransomware. As only the attacks against companies were taken into
account, there may be many more systems that suffered damage if taking unconfirmed systems
into account.
Various industries were targeted including but not limited to public institutions, education,
broadcasting, finance/security/insurance, manufacturing, IT, distribution, communications, etc.
Based on the first half of 2019 and in terms of percentage, most of the ransomware attacks were
done against the manufacturing industry (53%), followed by finance (15%), information service
(11%), and retails industry (9%).
The attacker utilized meticulously-made spear-phishing attacks to target companies. They
attempted attacks after pinpointing email recipients and meticulously wrote the email content in
languages their targets use. One notable thing is that the attacker targeted non-Russian countries.
The attacker designed the ransomware to first check keyboard layout and character set, and if the
target is Russian or that of CIS nation’s, it does not run.

Ransomware Variants
Next is the change in the number of CLOP Ransomware variants that were found in the first half of
2019. In February 2019, a large number of CLOP Ransomware variants were found. Note that
‘ClopReadMe.txt,’ CLOP Ransomware’s ransom note, was first revealed in Pastebin.com on
February 8, 2019.

Attack Process
The attack is carried out through preparation, domination, and execution phase. Specifically, there
are 10 phases in total. The actual distribution and execution of CLOP Ransomware are the very last
phase. The 3 big phases and the phases divided into 10 specific phases are as follows:
Preparation

Sends malicious document attachment file via email to the first attack target
and install remote control malware

1

User opens malicious document file (Excel, Word) attached to an email

2

Runs remote control malware downloader via macro inserted to a document file

3

If the system is added to AD (Active Directory) and operated in it,downloads
remote control malware file and runs it (targeting AD environment)

4

Remote control malware file installs Cobalt Strike Beacon to the system

Domination

Dominates system within AD using Cobalt Strike

5

Checks AD domain configuration info

6

Escalates run privilege using vulnerability

7

Runs Mimikatz module with escalated privilegeand obtains local administrator
account or credential of AD domain administrator account

8

If AD domain administrator account is successfully obtained,connects to domain
controller server and dominates system connected to domain

3/11

Execution

Attempts CLOP Ransomware infection on system within AD

9

Prepares malware such as CLOP Ransomware in the domain controller’s shared
folder

10

Distributes and runs CLOP Ransomware by using task scheduler or remote
command to the system connected to AD domain

CLOP Ransomware’s Change Trend
Compared to the past, CLOP Ransomware did not change fundamentally in terms of encryption
method and operation as a service. The difference is that it now compares after obtaining CRC
instead of strings in process termination routine and encryption exception path.
Recent Changes in CLOP Ransomware
Additional change was confirmed in CLOP Ransomware collected in the second half of 2020. The
past version worked by adding a symmetric-key that is encrypted with public-key along with
signature to the back of the encrypted file, but the recently-confirmed CLOP Ransomware works by
adding ‘.Cllp’ extension to the same name, saving signature and encrypted key to a newly-created
file.

Moreover, routine that terminates other processes and routine that deletes volume shadow copy got
removed. However, the file with the identical certificate that is in charge of the process termination
routine was discovered along, which can be assumed that the method of CLOP Ransomware
changed. It has changed to make the additional file become capable of such a feature instead of
CLOP Ransomware binary.

Packing method is also one of the changes. CLOP Ransomware has the appearance of a packer
just like other malware such as FlawedAmmyy. This means that it keeps encoded binary to bypass
file detection, and upon execution, runs the original binary decoded in memory.
Change of Ransom Note
In 2019, there were no big changes made to the content of the ransom note file of CLOP
Ransomware. It mostly consists of notice that the files are encrypted, note of caution, and email
address of the attacker. However, CLOP Ransomware discovered since October 2020 not only
includes contact to recover encrypted files, but also a message of threat against the victim that they
will publish sensitive data of the company on a deep-web. Leaked information of the company was
published on a deep website mentioned in the ransom note below.

Analysis of Attack on Distribution Giant E-Land
This paper will now take a brief look on the attack against E-Land based on the analysis of CLOP
Ransomware attack.
Like the previous CLOP Ransomware, a system infected by CLOP Ransomware used in the attack
against company A cannot be restored. This ransomware uses a symmetric key algorithm to
encrypt each file, and an encrypted symmetric key with a public key that exists within the binary.
This means that if a private key corresponding to the public key is unknown, the encrypted files
cannot be restored.
However, the previous CLOP Ransomware and the new CLOP Ransomware have different
methods of saving the encrypted key. As explained in the ‘CLOP Ransomware’s Change Trend’
section, the early version used a method of attaching encrypted keys along with specific signatures
in the back of the encrypted file. However, the recently discovered CLOP Ransomware creates an
additional file with an added ‘.Clip’ extension that has the same filename (normal filename kept) as
the encrypted file, and saves the relevant key to that ‘.Clip’ file. The CLOP Ransomware used for
the attack on E-Land is the latter.

8/11

Files cannot be restored as the attacker’s secret key is unknown, but unlike the previous version,
the ransomware does not have the command to delete volume shadow copy (a basic feature of
Windows which is a saved copy of a file, folder, or a volume of a specific time). Hence, if a recovery
point before ransomware affection exists, it is possible to revert the system to the uninfected state.

Furthermore, CLOP Ransomware file used in attack against E-Land contains info of the following
digital signature certificate.

Figure 7. Certificate used by CLOP Ransomware during attack against E-Land
AhnLab confirmed various files with certificates identical to CLOP Ransomware that was used to
attack E-Land. According to the analysis result, other files with the certificate were distributed since
October, and were created as not only ransomware, but also files to disable Windows Defender

anti-malware products. This means that the same group is developing CLOP Ransomware as well
as another various ransomware using the same certificate.
In conclusion, the attacker utilized meticulous and carefully-planned strategy to attack E-Land. The
attacker utilized and distributed CLOP Ransomware malware to abuse the fact that multiple
systems can be controlled at once through AD. In this process, the attacker installs remote control
malware and obtains system administrator privilege. The target company takes tremendous
damage as their system is infected with CLOP Ransomware, their internal information is leaked,
and administrator accounts are stolen. The attacker blackmails the company by threatening not
only to encrypt the files, but also publish the fact that the company is infected with ransomware and
stolen information to the public if they don’t pay the ransom. The attacker of CLOP Ransomware is
following the recent trend of threatening companies with two hostages: file encryption and internal
information leakage.
CLOP Ransomware attack that occurred since 2019 is still on-going in 2020. The attacker is
evolving by changing the method of malware distribution and attack. There are also reported cases
of the attacker taking control of a company’s AD server and letting it stay dormant, not running the
ransomware immediately. Because of the time disruption factor, it is even harder to reverse track
the attack when the ransomware attack occurs.
Both individuals and companies must work together to defend against CLOP Ransomware attacks.
Above all, it is crucial for individuals to improve their security awareness. Adequate user education
must be provided to prevent falling victim to spear-phishing, and also frequently check whether
software is updated to the latest version and whether they are functioning properly. Additionally, the
users must backup important documents and files in case of accidents. Companies must pay extra
attention to AD security and tightly manage account info. If a security product has been installed,
the system must be monitored periodically so that signs of the system abnormality can be found in
a timely manner.
