Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of
the Department of Defense (DoD). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the N
government. This malware variant has been identified as TAINTEDSCRIBE. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North K
HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers to maintain a presence on vict
further network exploitation. DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean gover
activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use
should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI C
and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This report looks at a full-featured beaconing implant and its command modules. These samples uses FakeTLS for session authentication and for
utilizing a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) algorithm. The main executable disguises itself as Microsoft’s Narrator. It downloads its comman
from a command and control (C2) server and then has the capability to download, upload, delete, and execute files; enable Windows CLI access;
processes; and perform target system enumeration.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10288834-2.v1.stix.

Description

This file is the main implant executable. For persistence, when executed the malware copies itself into the current user’s Startup folder as “Narrato
can have 5 hard-corded callback IP addresses/Ports. However, only 2 IP addresses are set, both to 211.192.239.232:8443. It will randomly pick o
addresses and attempt to connect to it. If it fails, it will wait 60 seconds and then try another IP address.
It performs the connection and authentication, then it attempts to download an additional module (3005f1308e4519477ac25d7bbf054899 or
68fa29a40f64c9594cc3dbe8649f9ebc) from the C2, which it loads and uses for command processing.
The modules export a function, CreateFileProcEx or CreateFileEx. The function is called by this sample with a number of arguments, including a h
connection socket.
The malware utilizes a “FakeTLS” scheme in an attempt to obfuscate its network communications. It picks a random URL from a list (Figure 1) to
certificate. The sample and the C2 externally appear to perform a standard TLS authentication, however, most of the fields used are filled with ran
rand().
Once the FakeTLS handshake is complete, all further packets use a FakeTLS header, followed by LFSR encrypted data.
--Begin packet structure-17 03 01 <2 Byte data length> <LFSR encrypted data>
--End packet structure-After the TLS authentication, the sample performs a handshake with the C2 (outlined in Figure 2). After this exchange, the implant sends the Victi

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
