When the source code for the botnet creation kit known as Carberp (Trojan.Carberp) was
leaked in June 2013, security experts predicted it would only be a matter of time before the
information-stealing malware code would be modified and reused. Those experts were
proven right when Trojan.Carberp.B was uncovered in late 2014. Symantec has now
observed yet another modified version of Carberp (Trojan.Carberp.C) being spread through
a spam campaign mainly targeting Australia.
This latest version of the malware is still focused on stealing information and has the ability
to download additional plugins that add to its functionality.
The Carberp malware likes to travel, it would seem. In its early days, Carberp was
exclusively used to swipe online banking credentials and other valuable information in
Russian-speaking countries but was later modified to allow the malware to target US banks.

Just like any successful business, expansion is the key and now Carberp is exploring yet
another continent.
The fact that the new variant is mainly targeting Australia may also point to a wider trend in
malware authors venturing into the land down under, as recently highlighted by a significant
increase in cryptomalware hitting Australian computers.

Analysis
The spam email used to spread Trojan.Carberp.C claims to be a payment reminder and
includes an attachment that poses as an invoice. The following is an example of the file
name normally used for the attachment:
invoice.[RANDOM NUMBERS]_2014.12.11.doc.zip

2/5

Figure 2. Spam email with malicious attachment
As you've probably already guessed, the attachment isn't an invoice and is actually
malware packed with Visual Basic. Interestingly, after discovering this spam campaign on
December 15, 2014, we noticed during our analysis that the compilation date of the
malware was just one day previous on December 14. The malware authors obviously didn’t
waste much time between coding up and releasing (however, this date can’t always be
trusted).

What's interesting about this Carberp variant is the number of components involved in the
attack, which are used to hide the infection and to silently download additional encrypted
payloads that are then injected stealthily into processes. Additional components are
embedded in the dropper (detected as Trojan.Dropper) and compressed.
The attackers behind this threat know that 64-bit architecture is now becoming the standard
so they embedded components that are able to infect both 32-bit and 64-bit computers, a
tactic that is increasingly common, as seen in other threats such as W64.Xpiro and
Trojan.Poweliks.
In Carberp.C, we identified the following embedded components:
MyFault—A Windows driver developed by Sysinternals that is normally used to trigger
system crashes. This module on its own is not malicious and is used for
troubleshooting. But the malware authors may have implemented it in order to trigger
a blue screen of death (BSoD) in case the malware is being analyzed.
3/5

Downloader—A silent payload downloader (detected as Trojan.Carberp.C)
Carberp Driver—Can be used to kill processes and to inject into memory malicious
payloads with the aim to hide the infection (detected as Trojan.Carberp.C)
A typical attack scenario works in the following way:
1. User receives a spam email and opens the malicious attachment which executes the
Trojan
2. The Trojan injects code into a Windows process and decrypts and decompresses
embedded 32-bit or 64-bit modules (depending on the operating system)
3. The Trojan then contacts the command-and-control (C&C) server with information
about the infection and requests additional 32-bit or 64-bit payloads (depending on the
operating system)
4. The payload is then downloaded, decrypted, and loaded into memory so that it is not
visible
As I’ve already noted, the malicious attachment drops additional components (32-bit or 64bit) depending on the computer architecture. These malicious files will contact the C&C
server and send back details from the compromised computer such as:
File system type
User name of user that executed the malware
Name and path of the executed file
Time and date of the infection
Process ID and parent PID
The malware is also able to download additional plugins that are injected into a newly
created svchost.exe process in order to keep the infection hidden. We were able to identify
plugins for different CPU architecture such as the following:
host.dat
update.dat
[VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER]_32.dat
[VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER]_64.dat
list32.dat
list64.dat
During our analysis, we were able to download list32.dat, which is a plugin used to hook
specific APIs in order to steal confidential information such as user names and passwords
from different internet browsers.

Symantec advises users to be cautious when dealing with suspicious emails and to avoid
clicking on suspicious links or opening attachments in unsolicited email.
