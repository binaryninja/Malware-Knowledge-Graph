Over the past months, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team has been tracking the Iranian
hacker group known as Moses Staff. The group was first spotted in October 2021 and claims
their motivation is to harm Israeli companies by leaking sensitive, stolen data.
Aside from Israel, which appears to be the main target of the group, Moses Staff was
observed targeting organizations in other countries, including Italy, India, Germany, Chile,
Turkey, UAE, and the US. The group targets a variety of industries, among them
Government, Finance, Travel, Energy, Manufacturing, and the Utilities industry.
Following recently published research detailing the group’s TTPs including their main tools
“PyDcrypt” and “DCSrv”, the Cybereason Nocturnus team discovered a previously
unidentified Remote Access Trojan (RAT) in the Moses Staff arsenal dubbed StrifeWater.
The StrifeWater RAT appears to be used in the initial stage of the attack and this stealthy
RAT has the ability to remove itself from the system to cover the Iranian group’s tracks. The
RAT possesses other capabilities, such as command execution and screen capturing, as well
as the ability to download additional extensions.
Normally, once the group infiltrates an organization and steals sensitive data, they deploy
ransomware to encrypt the infected machines. Unlike financially motivated cybercrime
ransomware groups who encrypt the files as leverage for ransom payment, the encryption of
the files in the Moses Staff attacks serves two purposes: inflicting damages by disrupting
critical business operations, and covering the attackers’ tracks.
The end goal for Moses Staff appears to be more politically-motivated rather than financial.
Analysis of the group’s conduct and operations suggests that Moses Staff leverages cyber
espionage and sabotage to advance Iran’s geopolitical goals by inflicting damage and
spreading fear. (Related Iranian APT research: PowerLess Trojan: Iranian APT Phosphorus

Key Findings
Novel Remote Access Trojan: A newly undocumented RAT dubbed StrifeWater
assessed to be part of the arsenal used by Iranian APT Moses Staff. The RAT is
assessed to be specifically used in the initial phase of infection and is later replaced
with other tools
Various Functionality: The StrifeWater RAT has various capabilities, among them:
listing system files, executing system commands, taking screen captures, creating
persistence, and downloading updates and auxiliary modules.
Under the Radar: The StrifeWater RAT appears to be removed from the infected
environment in time for the deployment of the ransomware. This is likely the reason the
RAT was not detected before.

State-Sponsored Ransomware: Moses Staff employs ransomware post-exfiltration
not for financial gain, but to disrupt operations, obfuscate espionage activity, and to
inflict damage to systems to advance Iran’s geopolitical goals.
Victims Across the Globe: The Moses Staff list of victims includes multiple countries
and regions, among them: Israel, Italy, India, Germany, Chile, Turkey, UAE, and the
US.

StrifeWater: A New Iranian RAT
The Cybereason Nocturnus Team has been tracking the activities of the Moses Staff threat
group since their operations first became known in 2021. While monitoring the group’s
activity, Cybereason researchers discovered an undocumented RAT dubbed StrifeWater that
is used by Moses Staff in the initial stage of the attack. It was observed that the StrifeWater
RAT was deployed in infected environments under the name “calc.exe”. One of the key clues
that led to the discovery of the StrifeWater RAT came from an analysis of a new variant of
the PyDCrypt malware used by the Moses Staff group.
Zeroing-in on the Moses Staff PyDCrypt Malware
The Nocturnus Team found a new sample of the PyDCrypt malware, which was described in
Checkpoint’s blog published in November 2021. PyDCrypt is written in python and compiled
using PyInstaller. Its goal is to spread to other computers and to drop the payload “DCSrv”, a
ransomware variant based on the publicly available tool DiskCryptor.
According to previous observations, the Moses Staff group builds a new sample of PyDCrypt
for each targeted organization with hard coded parameters such as an admin username and
password, a machines list, and a local domain. The inclusion of this hard coded information
means PyDCrypt is only deployed in a late stage of the attack after the environment is
already compromised and sufficient reconnaissance efforts to map out the target’s
environment have already taken place.
The newly discovered PyDCrypt variant had one significant change to it: instead of the
ransomware payload, the script contains what appears to be a test executable embedded
which merely prints “Hello” upon execution. This could indicate that this variant is still in the
development and testing phase.
Moses Staff often uses the folder “C:\Users\Public” to store its deployed tools. As part of its
execution, PyDCrypt copies the original Windows calculator binary (calc.exe) from system32
to the folder where the rest of the payloads are saved (C:\Users\Public\calc.exe) and then
deletes it:

3/12

We suspect that PyDCrypt’s removal of “calc.exe” from the infected machine is an attempt to
remove evidence of the StrifeWater RAT, which is also named “calc.exe” by the attackers.
We estimate that the replacement of the StrifeWater RAT with the original Windows
Calculator binary and its immediate deletion, was done in an attempt to cover the attackers’
tracks and thwart forensic analysis efforts.
Due to the fact that PyDCrypt is a late stage attack tool that is deployed after reconnaissance
was undertaken, Moses Staff must have a foothold of the infected environments before its
deployment. Based on our analysis of the StrifeWater RAT, we suspect that it is used by the
attackers to gain a foothold and to conduct initial reconnaissance on the compromised
target.
StrifeWater AnalysisStrifeWater is a previously undocumented RAT that is suspected to be
used in the initial stages of the Moses Staff infection chain in order to achieve persistence
and gain control over the network, appearing as the file “calc.exe”:

StrifeWater execution as seen in the

Cybereason XDR Platform
The main capabilities of StrifeWater include:
Listing system files
Executing shell commands using cmd.exe
Taking screen captures
Creating persistence via a scheduled task
Downloading updates and auxiliary modules
In addition, the RAT can extend its capabilities by downloading several module extensions,
although the functionality of these modules is not known at the time of writing.
The RAT has the following PDB string:
“C:\Users\win8\Desktop\ishdar_win8\1\x64\Release\brokerhost.pdb”
It uses a hard coded IP address and URI to communicate with its command and control (C2)
server (87.120.8[.]210:80/RVP/index8.php):

Although the malware always uses the same IP address and URL, it also contains a domain
and an additional URL that have yet been observed in use:

RVP/index3.php

Hardcoded domain, IP, and URI
At the beginning of execution, the StrifeWater RAT collects profiling data about the infected
machine in order to create a unique token for that device. The data used to create the token
are:

Machine name
User name
OS version
Architecture
Time zone
User privileges

The string displayed in the image above is then XORed with a hard coded key and combined
with an additional hard coded string in order to create the token:

Unique token sent to the C2
The same key (“9c4arSBr32g6IOni”) is used to encrypt all commands that are sent and
received from the C2.
StrifeWater RAT Key Commands
The StrifeWater RAT receives various commands from the C2, including:
Listing system files

Going through Windows folders function
Executing shell commands using cmd.exe

Executing cmd.exe function

Persistence
The RAT will create persistence using a scheduled task named: ”Mozilla\Firefox Default
Browser Agent 409046Z0FF4A39CB”

Creating a scheduled task for persistence
Download an updated version of the RAT
Self deletion
Download files to the infected machine
Updating the sleep time responses of the malware (the default is 20 - 22
seconds)
Auxiliary Modules
The StrifeWater RAT has the capability to download different modules based on the
command received, although the functionality of these other modules are not known at the
time of writing this report. The available extensions are named:
mainfunc

7/12

Ah13
mkb64
strt

Downloading and loading the auxiliary module “mainfunc”
In case the command to download the extension “strt” is received and the extension is
already loaded, the RAT will send to the C2 the contents of a file named:
“C:\users\public\libraries\async.dat”
This file probably contains data that is related to the functionality of the extension “strt”.
C2 Communication Parameters
The StrifeWater RAT appears to distinguish between the type of data that is being sent to the
C2 by the parameter “name” that is being sent in the packet to the C2. The parameter can be
any value between “name0” to “name12”:
C2 communication with parameter “name0”
C2 communication with parameter “name2”
C2 communication with parameter “name3”
Meaning of the different “name parameters”:

Conclusion
In this report, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team analyzed a previously unknown RAT dubbed
StrifeWater that is being used in targeted ransomware attacks, carried out by the Iranian APT
group Moses Staff. The StrifeWater RAT is suspected to be one of the main tools that are
used to create a foothold in victim environments, and appears to only be used in the earlier
stages of the attack.
Our analysis suggests that the Moses Staff operators make conscious efforts to stay under
the radar and avoid detection until the last phase of the attack when they deploy and execute
their ransomware payload. Furthermore, our research shows that the Moses Staff modus
operandi includes attempts to masquerade its arsenal as legitimate Windows software along
with the removal of their initial persistence and reconnaissance tools. This tactic helps to
prevent investigators from discovering the full flow of the attack and thus the StrifeWater RAT
remained undetected.
Moses Staff’s goals seem aligned with Iran’s cyber warfare doctrine, seeking to sabotage
government, military, and civilian organizations related to its geo-political opponents. Unlike
criminal cybercrime groups that use ransomware to coerce their victims to pay a ransom fee,

9/12

it is assessed that the Moses Staff group will leak sensitive information without demanding a
ransom fee, and it was previously assessed that their goals are political in nature.
The emergence of new PyDyrcypt malware samples, further shows that the Iranian APT
group Moses Staff is still active and continues its nefarious activities and development of its
attack arsenal.
The Cybereason XDR Platform detects and blocks the StrifeWater RAT and other advanced
TTPs used in this operation. Cybereason is dedicated to teaming with defenders to end
attacks on the endpoint, across enterprise, to everywhere the battle is taking place.
