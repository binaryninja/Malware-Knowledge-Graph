An international collaborative reporting project has established the frightening extent to which
governments around the world, including India, could be using surveillance tools in ways that
have nothing to do with national security.

New Delhi: A leaked database of thousands of telephone numbers believed to have been
listed by multiple government clients of an Israeli surveillance technology firm includes over
300 verified Indian mobile telephone numbers, including those used by ministers, opposition
leaders, journalists, the legal community, businessmen, government officials, scientists,
rights activists and others, according to an investigation by The Wire and 16 media
partners.
Forensic tests conducted as part of this project on a small cross-section of phones
associated with these numbers revealed clear signs of targeting by Pegasus spyware in 37
phones, of which 10 are Indian. Without subjecting a phone to this technical analysis, it is
not possible to conclusively state whether it witnessed an attack attempt or was
successfully compromised.
NSO Group, the Israeli company which sells Pegasus worldwide, says its clients, are
confined to “vetted governments”, believed to number 36. Though it refuses to identify its
customers, this claim rules out the possibility that any private entity in India or abroad is
responsible for the infections which The Wire and its partners have confirmed.
The leaked database was accessed by Paris-based media nonprofit Forbidden Stories and
Amnesty International and shared with The Wire, Le Monde, The Guardian, Washington
Post Die Zeit, Suddeutsche Zeitung and 10 other Mexican, Arab and European news
organisations as part of a collaborative investigation called the ‘Pegasus Project’.
Forbidden Stories, which
accessed the data, says it
comprises records of phone
numbers selected as
targets by NSO clients, a
claim the company formally
denied while conceding that
its clients might have used
these numbers for “other
purposes”.
A majority of the numbers
identified in the list were
geographically concentrated in 10 country clusters: India, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary,
Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Each of these countries have been identified in the past by experts at Citizen Lab – a digital
surveillance research organisation based out of the University of Toronto that laid the
groundwork for WhatsApp’s 2019 lawsuit against the NSO Group – as having been a region

2/5

of focus for Pegasus operators.
Working together with the technical lab of Amnesty International, a team of over 80
journalists coordinated by Forbidden Stories sought to identify and verify the individuals to
whom these numbers belong and then conduct a forensic examination of the phones in use
by them for the period covered by the data, which, in the Indian case was approximately
mid-2017 to mid-2019.

The Indian Telegraph Act and Information Technology Act prescribe procedures that must
be followed for lawful interception. Different countries have different laws but the use of
hacking to deliver surveillance spyware in India by any individual, private or official, is an
offence under the IT Act.
The Wire will be revealing the names it has been able to verify under different categories, in
a step by step fashion with its partners over the next few days.
The numbers of those in the database include over 40 journalists, three major opposition
figures, one constitutional authority, two serving ministers in the Narendra Modi
government, current and former heads and officials of security organisations and scores of
businesspersons.
The presence of a number in the database indicates its likely selection as a target for
surveillance but whether a phone was actually hacked and infected can only be established
through forensic examination of the device – more easily done if the instrument in question
is an iPhone.
Among the numbers in the Pegasus Project database is one that was registered in the
name of a sitting Supreme Court judge. However, The Wire has not been able to confirm
whether the number, which the judge gave up before it was added to the list, was still being
used by him for WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging apps when the number was
selected. Until such time as we are able to establish the number’s actual user during the
period in question, we are withholding the name of the judge.
The Wire and its partners will also not be revealing the identity of any names that appear to
be the subject of counter-terrorism or state-to-state espionage, with the exception of 13
heads of state or government around the world.
Committed to privacy rights, says Indian government
In a response to detailed questions sent by Pegasus Project partners to the Prime
Ministers’ Office earlier this week, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology
said that “India is a robust democracy that is committed to ensuring the right to privacy to all

3/5

its citizens as a fundamental right” and that the “allegations regarding government
surveillance on specific people has no concrete basis or truth associated with it
whatsoever.”
Without specifically denying that Pegasus is being used by the government, the MEITY
response said, “Each case of interception, monitoring, and decryption is approved by the
competent authority… The procedure therefore ensures that any interception, monitoring or
decryption of any information through any computer resource is done as per due process of
law.”

In fact, the procedure for lawful interception involves not just written, time-bound
authorisation in each instance but the use of the telecom or computer resource intermediary
as well, who is supposed to enable the interception, and does not cover the activities
proscribed by Section 43 of the IT Act under the definition of “hacking”.
Hacking an individual’s smartphone is a necessary step in subjecting an individual to
surveillance by spyware such as Pegasus.
NSO says data ‘may be’ linked to its customers
Though the NSO Group insists the leaked database is “not a list of numbers targeted by
governments using Pegasus”, it told The Wire and Pegasus Project partners in a letter from
its lawyers that it had “good reason to believe” the leaked data “may be part of a larger list
of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”.
Asked what these “other purposes” could be, the company changed tack and claimed that
the leaked records were based on “publicly accessible, overt sources such as the HLR
Lookup service” – and that it had no “bearing on the list of the customer targets of Pegasus
or any other NSO products”.
HLR lookup services are used to test whether a phone number of interest is currently on a
network.

If the leaked numbers represent the output of an HLR Lookup service, as NSO itself
suggests, the fact that the data is from countries known to have been a region of focus for
Pegasus operators in the past raises two questions: were they all generated by the same
service provider? Were they all consolidated and held in one place for some common
purpose?

While HLR lookups have obvious commercial relevance for telemarketers, telecom security
experts say they could well be an integral part of spyware-driven surveillance. “Here’s the
most important reason why you would use an HLR lookup,” Karsten Nohl, chief scientist for
Security Research Labs in Berlin, told the Pegasus Project. “You would know that the phone
is on” – and hence available for hacking.
NSO disputes the suggestion that Pegasus could have been used to target 50,000 persons,
implying that the scale of targeting across all government clients is around 5,000 a year.
The sensitivity of the information involved – governments which select high-profile
individuals for potential hacking and surveillance would hardly like the details or metadata of
their targeting to be known by a foreign government or private entity – further adds to the
questions which the leaked database and NSO’s firm denial that this has any connection to
Pegasus raise.
None of the governments involved have an incentive to shed light on the issue. However, in
countries that are governed by the rule of law, the possibility that a massive and illegal
surveillance programme is being used to target prominent individuals from all walks of life –
including political opponents and journalists – poses a clear threat to democracy and will
raise demands for an independent probe.
The Pegasus Project is a collaborative investigation that involves more than 80 journalists
from 17 news organisations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories with the
technical support of Amnesty International’s Security Lab. Read all our coverage here.
