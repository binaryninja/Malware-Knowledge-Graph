Damballa discovers new toolset linked to Destover

Entertainment in November 2014, and also for its
relationship based on its wiping technique with the
Shamoon malware used in the attack on Saudi Aramco in
2012. The Destover trojan is a wiper that deletes files off of
an infected system, rendering it useless.
Unlike most malware, the goal of Destover and other wiping
malware is to cause damage for ideological and political
reasons not for financial gain. For example, at Sony,
attackers wiped files off of workstations making them
completely inoperative for unclear political goals of the
attackers. The Saudi Aramco attack using Shamoon was so
destructive it temporarily drove up the price of hard drives
because an estimated 50,000 were needed to help Saudi
Aramco recover, also for unclear ideological and political
motives against the Al-Saud royal family.
Much was revealed In the weeks and months following these
breaches, except for how attackers were able to stay
undetected within the network long enough to expand their
presence and exfiltrate Terabytes of sensitive information.
While researching a newer sample of Destover, we came
across two files that were identified by one antivirus product
at the time under a generic signature. After analyzing
further, we found two utilities closely related to Destover.
Both utilities would be used during an attack to evade
detection while moving laterally through a network to
broaden the attack surface. Both utilities had usage
statements and were named as setMFT and afset.

What is setMFT?
setMFT is used to copy the timestamp settings from a source
file on disk to a destination file, also called timestomping.
Timestomping combined with similar file naming enables a
file to blend in with legitimate files in the same directory.
This can conceal a file’s existence from security personnel
looking for malicious files or scans of files created after a
certain date. Timestomping can get past a cursory check for
malicious files. A thorough forensic examination will reveal
that a file has been timestomped based on conflicting record
dates and possibly log files.
The sample discovered by Damballa requires the presence
of the file ‘usbdrv3.sys’ in the same directory. It turns out to
be the renamed Eldos RawDisk driver used by Destover to
gain direct access to disk. Either the driver is meant to be

delivered with setMFT or is dropped along with setMFT from
Destover itself. Destover and setMFT are related via the
lengthy license key used with the Eldos driver:
99E2428CCA4309C68AAF8C616EF3306582A64513E55C786A864BC83DAFE0C78585B692047273
B0E55275102C664C5217E76B8E67F35FCE385E4328EE1AD139EA6AA26345C4F93000DBBC7EF1579D4F
Another feature is that this utility interacts with the attacker
through on the command line rather than being delivered
and executed by a dropper without interaction. setMFT
comes with an English usage statement in case the attacker
forgets the placement of arguments:

What is afset?
afset, like setMFT is also used to timestomp files plus clean
Microsoft Windows logs based on criteria (id, time) from the
user. It also changes the PE build time and checksum. afset
provides more granular functionality to allow the user to set
only certain timestamps on a file (sia, fna or both). To
achieve the timestomping and log cleaning functions, afset
uses the RawDisk driver with the same lengthy license key.
The afset sample we obtained appeared to be incomplete or
a partial development version. The sample attempted to
write a randomly named file with a .sys extension to the
local directory with the contents of the “ICONS” resource
which is supposed to be the encoded RawDisk driver.
However, it failed to decode on execution. If the driver write
had completed it would have registered as a service using
the same random driver name. Plus, it would have been
used to obtain a handle to write the MFT record for the
target file to match either a user supplied file or by default
the file “%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\tapi32.dll”.
According to the handy usage statement, conditional log
cleaning is only available on 32-bit systems. From our
dynamic testing, it appears to clear the event log and then
rewrite it without the offending entries. A full reversing of
the log cleaning feature was not performed and dynamic
analysis failed due to errors in the driver extraction routine
from the resources. Fortunately, the usage statement gives
insight to the full functionality of the tool:

Afset is used interactively on the target system. It allows the
attacker to remain stealthy and erase their tracks as they
move through the network. A full forensic analysis of a
system would reveal the presence of afset and missing log
activity but it’s likely this activity would go undetected
initially creating high-risk infection dwell time.
For enterprise security teams, the utility of setMFT and afset
means that many of the tools and methods they use to
identify the presence of attackers would be thwarted. If the
adversary gains access to corporate servers and can clean
and redirect log files, they can prevent any evidence of their
activity from reaching a SIEM or log analysis solution.
These tools appear to have limited distribution, which
means that newer versions of the tools could go undetected
by standard AV for an extended length of time. Also, as
mentioned, the ability to have the tools blend with legitimate
system files allows the attacker to evade detection during a
cursory glance by personnel. These capabilities, when used
together with tools that enable attackers to obtain network
credentials and disable defenses, allows them to permeate
the network undetected for an extended period of time.

Conclusion
The attackers behind large and long-lasting attacks are very
well organized, patient and determined. Toolsets like
Destover, afset and setMFT are part of an arsenal used
during a cyber attack. These tools are mainly used to help
the attackers remain under the radar for months or longer.
Gaining a foothold inside the victim’s network is a top
priority. History tells us that in most of the high-profile hacks
making news headlines, the attackers were able to spend
months hidden inside the victim’s network exfiltrating
Terabytes of data.
