Stealer malware is becoming the weapon of choice for Threat Actors (TA) to steal credentials from victims’ devices.
This malware family has the capability to steal the cookies, credentials, credit card (CC) information, crypto
wallets, and other sensitive details stored on the victim’s device. To accomplish this task, the malware uses various
techniques to extract information from the victim’s machine.
Cyble Research Labs has harvested the latest variant of Raccoon Stealer to study the stealer malware
family behavior and the techniques that it uses for infection. The TA behind the Raccoon Stealer has posted the
malware’s capabilities on a cybercrime forum, wherein he has mentioned that the malware can run on both 32- and
64-bit systems without .NET dependencies, and the logs are collected in RAM instead of the disk, among others.

Figure 1 TA Post on Cyber Crime Forum
Racoon Stealer has been observed in the wild since April 2019. Until then, the TA behind the Stealer had been
working on enhancing the techniques used by this malware. At the time of writing this analysis, Virus Total has more
than 9K samples of Racoon Stealer with 5+ positive detection.
The figure below shows the high-level execution flow of the Raccoon stealer malware. Initially, it connects to the TA’s
Telegram channel to get the Command and Control (C&C) IP. Further, the malware downloads the configuration data
and other payloads/modules to extract the credentials from the victim’s device and conduct the data exfiltration.

Technical Analysis
Cyble Research Labs analyzed this sample. Upon performing the static analysis, we found that the malware is x86
architecture Portable Executable (PE) binary written in C/C++ and compiled on 2020-06-24 05:58:17.

Figure 3 Static Information of Malware
Upon the initial execution of the malware in our research environment, we noticed that the malware was trying to
communicate to a telegatt[.]top domain and did not show any other behavior, as shown in the below figure.

Figure 4 Traffic Analysis of Malware
Upon further investigation, we determined that the malware was trying to access the “jdiamond13” channel on
Telegram using the services provided by telegatt[.]top, as shown in the figure below.

The figure below depicts the Process tree created by the malware.

After data exfiltration is completed, the Stealer removes its foothold by removing malware binaries and data files. The
following command is executed to perform self-delete.
cmd.exe /C timeout /T 10 /NOBREAK > Nul & Del /f /q
“C:\Users\MalWorkstation\Desktop\e28a6d3bdcfdad9ff4c37e6c22c1a52018e5076ec65b128614bcf0e8eb711171.exe”

Code Analysis and Debugging
Initially, during the code analysis, Cyble Research Labs found that the malware was packed. The malware decrypts
each segment during execution, performs self-injection, and does dynamic import loading. The figure below shows
that the malware has created a new binary in a newly allocated memory, and file execution will be transferred to the
decrypted binary.

Figure 8 Malware unpacking
Further, the malware performs a GET request to telegatt[.]top/jdiamond13 to access the Telegram bot profile page. If
the telegatt service is down, it uses other hardcoded domains to reach the profile, as shown below figure.

The malware copies the value “e7dd0fV46cjQG7jcdYm3TS3xk8CWP0R0zIw==25-v1f” from the Telegram bot
description page shown in Figure 5, and then shifts characters to align in proper
encrypted data. i.e., “fV46cjQG7jcdYm3TS3xk8CWP0R0zIw==”.
Then the malware uses RC4 encryption to decrypt the above string using
the hardcoded key “c5d49434634bb8485382d61999573882“.
A quick RC4 decryption revealed the URL of C&C, which is http[:]//185[.]163[.]45[.]162.

Figure 10 Decryption of encrypted data received from TA’s Telegram channel
Once the malware has the C&C URL, it generates a unique ID for the victim device and encrypts it using
RC4 encryption using the key “iV8+pT5$yP7{“, then it sends the unique ID to the attacker’s C&C.

Figure 11 Victim’s Unique ID sent to C&C
As shown in below figure, Once the C&C receives the above Victim ID as a request, it sends the RC4 encrypted
configuration data to the victim’s machine, which is then decrypted using the same key shown above.

The configuration data contains the below details, which Stealer uses to perform further actions.

Table 1 Configuration data present in the table.
Upon parsing the configuration file, the malware extracts the URL Paths for the first module and sends a request to
download the module.

Figure 13 Additional Payload Download from C&C
Upon receiving the PE file as a response, the malware uses CreateFile/WriteFile Application Programming Interface
(API) to write the binary onto the “AppData\LocalLow” location as “sqlite3.dll”.

Figure 14 Saving the PE file as sqlite3.dll
At this stage, the stealer copies various SQLite DB files from application locations like the browser present in the
victim machine and then uses “sqlite3.dll” to parse and extract the sensitive contents from the DB file, as shown in
the figure below.

Later, the malware sends another request to the C&C URL to download the additional modules. The figure below
shows that the malware downloads the modules compressed as a ZIP file.

Figure 16 Additional payloads downloaded from C&C
The below figure shows the additional modules (2nd Modules) required by the Stealer to extract credentials.

Figure 17 Modules required by malware for extraction of credentials.
Once the credential extraction is done, the Stealer creates a ZIP file and stores the victim’s credentials. Then, it
sends these credentials to the attacker’s C&C, as shown below.

In the below figure, we can see the data uploaded by the malware on our emulated environment.

Finally, the malware calls CreateProcess API to execute the command for self-destruct.

Conclusion
Threat Actors use similar kinds of stealer malware to steal sensitive data from victim devices. Presently, these
Stealers have been misused for malicious purposes across the globe. The malware has explicitly been spread
through pirated software and phishing campaigns.
In the past, we have observed that the TAs behind such stealers have targeted many businesses via their
employees for stealing credentials.
Cyble Research Labs will continuously monitor emerging threats and targeted cyber-attacks.
