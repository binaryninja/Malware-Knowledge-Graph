The Qualys Research Team has observed a new version of Chaos ransomware in
development. This blog reviews the malware’s updated functionality as well as its ongoing
evolution.
A ransomware builder called Chaos is still actively under development. The fourth version
has recently been observed being improved, as identified in underground forums as well as
code leaks in other community sites.
While the builder bills itself as ransomware, its functions are more like wiper malware.
Traditional ransomware is used by attackers to encrypt the victim’s file data and then
demand a ransom in exchange for its recovery. In recent years widespread examples of
ransomware have dominated the threat landscape – and the news headlines – with one
memorable example being DarkSide Ransomware.
Unlike most ransomware, wipers overwrite or remove the data from the victim’s systems. An
example of a well-known wiper is Shamoon/DistTrack, which was observed being used to
target Industrial Control Systems, steal information, and then destroy the victim’s systems.
In our analysis we have seen Chaos encrypting files of less than 2 MB but overwriting larger
files with random bytes. Because of this behavior, we believe it is more accurate to call it a
wiper.

A History of Chaos
A Trend Micro provides a summary analysis of the development of Chaos, which was first
discovered in June 2021. Since its inception four versions have been observed, the latest
iteration in August 2021. Even though it has not yet been used for an actual attack, it could
be highly disastrous if used in the future.
The four versions of Chaos described by TrendMicro are:
Version 1.0; released on 9 June 2021: Replaces file data with random bytes and then
encodes it with Base-64. From the outset, it has worming capability, distributing itself to
all drives.
Version 2.0; released on 17 June 2021: Administrative privileges are added, along with
the ability to delete all of the shadow copies.
Version 3.0; released on 5 July 2021: Includes encryption of files with AES/RSA
algorithms, but only files with a size less than 1MB.
Version 4.0; released on 5 August 2021: This latest version has put a limit of 2MB on
the files that will be encrypted.
Looking at all these versions, we can infer that Chaos remains an in-development
ransomware builder that may soon be offered in an underground market on the Dark Web
like other well-known ransomware. There is little doubt that attackers will continue
developing its capabilities – potentially based on feedback from other forum members where
it is being staged.

Technical Details
In the latest version of Chaos, the new extension given to encrypted/affected files is
CRYPTEDPAY, as the screenshot below reveals:

Fig.1 Encrypted files
Here is a list of extensions targeted by this malware:

Fig.2 Extensions supported
First, it checks for any other instance already in execution. If yes, then the malware will
terminate itself.
If not already running, it drops a copy at the below location and then executes itself.
“C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\svchost.exe”

Next, it terminates the current process.
Then the newly created process (i.e svchost.exe) searches for all the drives present and
starts encrypting them. It performs encryption only if the extension of the file is present in the
list shown above.
As the screen below illustrates, it then checks the file size. Files are encrypted with AES only
if the file size is less than ~2MB. The key used for AES encryption is randomly generated for
each file, and the key is then encrypted with RSA.

Fig.3 Code for file size check and encryption
This RSA-encrypted key is then encoded in Base-64 and kept at the start of the file with the
tags <Encryptedkey>…<Encryptedkey> followed by the encrypted file data.

4/7

If the file size is greater than ~2MB and less than ~200MB, random bytes of the length
(filesize/4) are generated and written in the encrypted file in Base-64 encoded format. If the
file size is greater than ~200MB, random bytes with the length greater than ~200MB and less
than ~300MB are generated and kept in the file in Base-64 format. This makes these files
completely useless.
The attacker then has Chaos drop the ransom note, in each encrypted folder as shown in
this screenshot:

The victim’s wallpaper is also changed to:

To the victim’s dismay, Chaos takes steps to make recovery impossible by deleting shadow
copies, backup catalog, and disabling windows recovery mode by executing the following
commands:
“vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete”
“bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set
{default} recoveryenabled no”
“wbadmin delete catalog -quiet”

Given the rapid and ongoing development of Chaos ransomware’s capabilities, it’s very clear
that if this ransomware ever used in cyber-attack, the victims may not be able to recover their
important data. Security professionals must take the utmost precaution to protect their
organizations from such destructive attackers.

Mitigation or Additional Important Safety Measures:
Network

Keep strong and unique passwords for login accounts.
6/7

Disable RDP if not used. If required change the RDP port to a non-standard port.
Configure firewall in the following way,
Deny access to External IPs trying to connect important ports (in this case RDP
port 3389)
Allow access to only IPs which are under your control.
Use VPN to access the network, instead of exposing RDP to the Internet. Possibility to
implement Two Factor Authentication (2FA).
Set lockout policy which hinders credentials guessing.
Create a separate network folder for each user when managing access to shared
network folders.
Take regular data backup

Protect systems from ransomware by periodically backing up important files regularly
and keep a recent backup copy offline. Encrypt your backup.
If your computer gets infected with ransomware, your files can be restored from the
offline backup once the malware has been removed.
Always use a combination of online and offline backup.
Do not keep offline backups connected to your system as this data could be encrypted
when ransomware strike.
Keep software updated

Always keep your security software (antivirus, firewall, etc.) up to date to protect your
computer from new variants of malware.
Regularly patch and update applications, software, and operating systems to address
any exploitable software vulnerabilities.
Do not download cracked/pirated software as they risk backdoor entry for malware into
your computer.
Avoid downloading software from untrusted P2P or torrent sites. In most cases, they
are malicious software.
Having minimum required privileges

Do not assign Administrator privileges to users. Most importantly, do not stay logged in as an
administrator unless it is strictly necessary. Also, avoid browsing, opening documents, or
other regular work activities while logged in as an administrator.
