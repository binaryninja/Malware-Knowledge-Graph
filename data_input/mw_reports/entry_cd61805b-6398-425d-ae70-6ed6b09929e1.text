Introduction
While investigating the Confucius threat actor, we found a recent spear phishing campaign that utilizes
Pegasus spyware-related lures to entice victims into opening a malicious document downloading a file
stealer. The NSO Group’s spyware spurred a collaborative investigation that found that it was being used to
target high-ranking individuals in 11 different countries.
In this blog entry, we take a look at the lures used by the malicious actor and provide a short analysis of the
file stealer used in the campaign, which was launched in early August.

The contents of the spear phishing email
The campaign involves a two-step attack. During the first phase, an email without a malicious payload
containing content copied from a legitimate Pakistani newspaper’s article is sent to the target. The sender
address, which is spoofed, impersonates the PR wing of the Pakistani Armed Forces (info@ispr.gov.pk).
Two days later, a second email — purportedly a warning from a Pakistani military about the Pegasus
spyware — containing a cutt.ly link to a malicious encrypted Word document and the password for
decryption will be sent to the target. The sender address impersonates a service similar to that on the first
email (alert@ispr.gov.pk).

Figure 1. Spear-phishing email from early August. Notice the insertion of logos from the Pakistani Army, Air Force, Navy,
and PR department.

If the target clicks on either the link or on the “unsubscribe” link, it will download a Word document from
the domain parinari[.]xyz.
The emails are sent either from an ExpressVPN exit node in Pakistan, or from a mail server under the
attacker’s control.

Examining the encrypted document containing macros
After entering the password mentioned in the message, a document containing macros is displayed on
screen.

Figure 2. Malicious document containing macros

If the victim enables macros, the malicious code will be loaded. If the victim enters any phone number and
clicks “SUBMIT,” the text field will be replaced by the message “Phone Number Not Found.”
Behind the scenes, a .NET DLL file named skfk.txt, which is filled with content found inside the
“Comments” property of the document, is created in the temporary directory. The file is then loaded in
memory via PowerShell.
Stage 1 is a simple download & execute program. It downloads an ASCII file from the same domain and
converts it into binary before loading it on to the memory and jump to a dynamic function.
Stage 2 is also .NET DLL file that downloads a third file from parinari[.]xyz, converts it from ASCII to
binary, and then creates a scheduled task to load it.
Stage 3 is similar to stage 1, with the only change being the URL to retrieve the next stage.
Stage 4 is the final payload (analyzed in the next section). it is never written in clear text to the file disk.

Figure 3. File stealer loading scheme

It should be noted that most of the compilation timestamps of these DLL files have been modified by the
attacker to a year in the far future (2060, 2099 …), and the server IP addresses are often hidden behind
CloudFlare.

Analysis of the file stealer
The final payload is a .NET DLL file designed to steal documents and images with the following extensions:

Figure 4. Code showing the main function of the file stealer

When a file matching one of the listed extensions is found, its MD5 hash is calculated and compared to an
exclusion list retrieved from the command-and-control (C&C) server pirnaram[.]xyz.
If the hash is not listed, the file is sent via the C&C to a directory named after the concatenation of the
machine name and the username. The exclusion list is different for every machine name-username string.

Other campaigns
During our monitoring of Confucius, we came across a campaign delivering the same payload, using a
different lure. In this instance, the campaign impersonated the Pakistani Defense Housing Authority.
Again, this threat actor’s interest in military personnel is obvious.

Figure 5. Spear-phishing email from early August

The lures used in an older campaign from April 2021 impersonated the Federal Board of Revenue. There
were minor differences in tools, tactics, and procedures: the malicious document was directly attached to
the spear phishing email — still encrypted — and the decryption password was sent in a different email.
The first stage was also hidden in the “Comments” section. However, the second stage contained the final
payload, which was once again a file stealer with the exact same structure (a .NET DLL). Instead of
exfiltrating the files through PHP scripts, they were done via FTP server.
It should be noted that in some occasions, the threat actor sent spear-phishing emails from the domain
name mailerservice[.]directory which we attributed to the Patchwork threat actor in previous research. We
disclosed multiple links between Patchwork and Confucius threat actors in the past, so this came as no
surprise to us.

Confucius Uses Pegasus Spyware-related Lures to Target Pakistani Military

In our previous research, we already found Confucius, which is known for targeting Pakistan military for
espionage purposes, employing multiple file stealers. While the code quality of its payloads is not of the
highest standard, this threat actor uses innovative techniques when crafting its malicious documents, such
as hiding malicious code in the comments section, or using encrypted documents to prevent automatic
analysis. Therefore, it’s highly likely that Confucius will continue to experiment and try out different kinds
of social engineering lures in future campaigns.
Despite the variety of lures used by the threat actor, best security practices still apply to these attacks.
Users should always be wary and avoid clicking on any link or downloading any file from unsolicited emails
or suspicious sources. Red flags such as unusual sender domains or grammatical and spelling errors are
also a sign that the email is malicious in nature, or at the very least, should be approached with proper
security protocols in mind.
The following security solutions can also protect users from email-based attacks:
Trend Micro™ Cloud App Security– Enhances the security of Microsoft Office 365 and other
cloud services via computer vision and real-time scanning. It also protects organizations from emailbased threats.
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector– Defends users through a combination of
real-time scanning and advanced analysis techniques for known and unknown attacks.
