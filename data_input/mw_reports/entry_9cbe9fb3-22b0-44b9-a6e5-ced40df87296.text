Chinese Government-Mandated Tax Software
Contains Malware, Enabling Backdoor Access
Summary
The FBI seeks to inform US companies in the healthcare, chemical, and
finance sectors of potential targeting activity by the Chinese
government against their business and operational components based
in China. As early as March 2019, at least two Western companies
operating in China detected malware that was delivered through
Chinese vendors that were responsible for releasing tax software
upgrades following changes in 2018 to China’s value-added tax (VAT).
The malware launched a backdoor into victim systems, which the FBI
assesses likely allows cyber actors to preposition to conduct remote
code execution and exfiltration activities on the victim’s network.
Although all companies conducting business in China may be
vulnerable to such activity, the US healthcare and chemical sectors
have been a common target of Chinese cyber operations for many
years. Pharmaceutical companies form a critical interdependency
between the manufacturing components of the chemical sector and
the supply chain of the Healthcare and Public Health Sector.

Compromise of the pharmaceutical supply chain provides malicious actors opportunities for theft of
US intellectual property, while public disclosure can cause cascading effects including loss of public
trust in both chemical and healthcare institutions. As previously highlighted in FBI PIN 20200521-001
released on 21 May 2020 and the US Department of Homeland Security’s joint advisory with
Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre, hackers continue to “actively target organizations that
include healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations,
and local governments.”
Threat
Baiwang and Aisino are the only government-authorized tax software service providers to operate
the Chinese value added tax (VAT) system. The use of either software provider is required by the
China Tax Bureau in order for US companies to operate within China’s market. Both companies
operate the VAT system under the management and oversight of state-owned enterprise the
National Information Security Engineering Center (NISEC). The NISEC has foundational links to the
3PLA.
In July 2018, an employee of a US pharmaceutical company with business interests in China
downloaded the Baiwang Tax Control Invoicing software program from baiwang.com. Since at least
March 2019, Baiwang released software updates which installed a driver automatically along with
the main tax program. In April 2019, employees of the pharmaceutical company discovered that the
software contained malware that created a backdoor on the company’s network.
In June 2020, a private cybersecurity firm reported that Intelligence Tax, a tax software from Aisino
Corporation that is required by a Chinese bank under the same VAT system, likely contained
malware that installed a hidden backdoor to the networks of organizations using the tax software.
The malware, named GoldenSpy, was designed to provide cyber actors with unfettered access to
victim networks and is believed to have been around since 2016. It is unclear how many
organizations may have been compromised.

Recommended Mitigations
 Patch all systems for critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely patching of Internet-connected
servers for known vulnerabilities and software processing Internet data, such as web
browsers, browser plugins, and document readers.
 Actively scan and monitor web applications for unauthorized access, modification, and
anomalous activities.
 Strengthen credential requirements and implement multi-factor authentication to protect
individual accounts, particularly for webmail and VPN access and for accounts that access
critical systems. Change passwords and do not reuse passwords for multiple accounts.
 Recommend developing a network baseline to allow for the identification of anomalous
account activity. Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity.
 Network device management interfaces, such as Telnet, SSH, Winbox, and HTTP, should be
turned off for WAN interfaces and secured with strong passwords and encryption when
enabled.
 Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity.
 When possible, segment critical information on air-gapped systems. Use strict access control
measures for critical data.
 Be mindful of new and existing cyber infrastructure for work and bioscience collaborations.
