Targeted ransomware incidents have brought a threat of disruptive and destructive attacks to
organizations across industries and geographies. FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence has
previously documented this threat in our investigations of trends across ransomware
incidents, FIN6 activity, implications for OT networks, and other aspects of post-compromise
ransomware deployment. Since November 2019, we’ve seen the MAZE ransomware being
used in attacks that combine targeted ransomware use, public exposure of victim data, and
an affiliate model.
Malicious actors have been actively deploying MAZE ransomware since at least May 2019.
The ransomware was initially distributed via spam emails and exploit kits before later shifting
to being deployed post-compromise. Multiple actors are involved in MAZE ransomware
operations, based on our observations of alleged users in underground forums and distinct
tactics, techniques, and procedures across Mandiant incident response engagements.
Actors behind MAZE also maintain a public-facing website where they post data stolen from
victims who refuse to pay an extortion fee.
The combination of these two damaging intrusion outcomes—dumping sensitive data and
disrupting enterprise networks—with a criminal service makes MAZE a notable threat to
many organizations. This blog post is based on information derived from numerous Mandiant
incident response engagements and our own research into the MAZE ecosystem and
operations.
Mandiant Threat Intelligence will be available to answer questions on the MAZE ransomware
threat in a May 21 webinar.
Victimology
We are aware of more than 100 alleged MAZE victims reported by various media outlets and
on the MAZE website since November 2019. These organizations have been primarily based
in North America, although victims spanned nearly every geographical region. Nearly every
industry sector including manufacturing, legal, financial services, construction, healthcare,
technology, retail, and government has been impacted demonstrating that indiscriminate
nature of these operations (Figure 1).

Multiple Actors Involved in MAZE Ransomware Operations Identified
Mandiant identified multiple Russian-speaking actors who claimed to use MAZE ransomware
and were seeking partners to fulfill different functional roles within their teams. Additional
information on these actors is available to Mandiant Intelligence subscribers. A panel used to
manage victims targeted for MAZE ransomware deployment has a section for affiliate
transactions. This activity is consistent with our assessment that MAZE operates under an
affiliate model and is not distributed by a single group. Under this business model,
ransomware developers will partner with other actors (i.e. affiliates) who are responsible for
distributing the malware. In these scenarios, when a victim pays the ransom demand, the
ransomware developers receive a commission. Direct affiliates of MAZE ransomware also
partner with other actors who perform specific tasks for a percentage of the ransom
payment. This includes partners who provide initial access to organizations and pentesters
3/30

who are responsible for reconnaissance, privilege escalation and lateral movement—each of
which who appear to work on a percentage-basis. Notably, in some cases, actors may be
hired on a salary basis (vs commission) to perform specific tasks such as determining the
victim organization and its annual revenues. This allows for specialization within the cyber
criminal ecosystem, ultimately increasing efficiency, while still allowing all parties involved to
profit.

MAZE Initially Distributed via Exploit Kits and Spam Campaigns
MAZE ransomware was initially distributed directly via exploit kits and spam campaigns
through late 2019. For example, in November 2019, Mandiant observed multiple email
campaigns delivering Maze ransomware primarily to individuals at organizations in Germany
and the United States, although a significant number of emails were also delivered to entities
4/30

in Canada, Italy, and South Korea. These emails used tax, invoice, and package delivery
themes with document attachments or inline links to documents which download and
execute Maze ransomware.
On November 6 and 7, a Maze campaign targeting Germany delivered macro-laden
documents using the subject lines “Wichtige informationen uber Steuerruckerstattung” and
“1&1 Internet AG - Ihre Rechnung 19340003422 vom 07.11.19” (Figure 3). Recipients
included individuals at organizations in a wide range of industries, with the Financial
Services, Healthcare, and Manufacturing sectors being targeted most frequently. These
emails were sent using a number of malicious domains created with the registrant address
gladkoff1991@yandex.ru.

On November 8, a campaign delivered Maze primarily to Financial Services and Insurance
organizations located in the United states. These emails originated from a compromised or
spoofed account and contained an inline link to download a Maze executable payload.
On November 18 and 19, a Maze campaign targeted individuals operating in a range of
industries in the United States and Canada with macro documents using phone bill and
package delivery themes (Figure 4 and Figure 5). These emails used the subjects “Missed
package delivery” and "Your AT&T wireless bill is ready to view" and were sent using a
number of malicious domains with the registrant address abusereceive@hitler.rocks.
Notably, this registrant address was also used to create multiple Italian-language domains
towards the end of November 2019.

Shift to Post-Compromise Distribution Maximizes Impact
Actors using MAZE have increasingly shifted to deploying the ransomware post-compromise.
This methodology provides an opportunity to infect more hosts within a victim’s environment
and exfiltrate data, which is leveraged to apply additional pressure on organizations to pay
extortion fees. Notably, in at least some cases, the actors behind these operations charge an
additional fee, in addition to the decryption key, for the non-release of stolen data.
Although the high-level intrusion scenarios preceding the distribution of MAZE ransomware
are broadly similar, there have been notable variations across intrusions that suggest
attribution to distinct teams. Even within these teams, the cyber criminals appear to be taskoriented meaning that one operator is not responsible for the full lifecycle. The following
sections highlight the TTPs seen in a subset of incidents and serve to illustrate the
7/30

divergence that may occur due to the fact that numerous, disparate actors are involved in
different phases of these operations. Notably, the time between initial compromise to
encryption has also been widely varied, from weeks to many months.
Initial Compromise
There are few clear patterns for intrusion vector across analyzed MAZE ransomware
incidents. This is consistent with our observations of multiple actors who use MAZE soliciting
partners with network access. The following are a sample of observations from several
Mandiant incident response engagements:
A user downloaded a malicious resume-themed Microsoft Word document that
contained macros which launched an IcedID payload, which was ultimately used to
execute an instance of BEACON.
An actor logged into an internet-facing system via RDP. The account used to grant
initial access was a generic support account. It is unclear how the actor obtained the
account's password.
An actor exploited a misconfiguration on an Internet-facing system. This access
enabled the actor to deploy tools to pivot into the internal network.
An actor logged into a Citrix web portal account with a weak password. This
authenticated access enabled the actor to launch a Meterpreter payload on an internal
system.
Establish Foothold & Maintain Presence
The use of legitimate credentials and broad distribution of BEACON across victim
environments appear to be consistent approaches used by actors to establish their foothold
in victim networks and to maintain presence as they look to meet their ultimate objective of
deploying MAZE ransomware. Despite these commonplace behaviors, we have observed an
actor create their own domain account to enable latter-stage operations.
Across multiple incidents, threat actors deploying MAZE established a foothold in victim
environments by installing BEACON payloads on many servers and workstations.
Web shells were deployed to an internet-facing system. The system level access
granted by these web shells was used to enable initial privilege escalation and the
execution of a backdoor.
Intrusion operators regularly obtained and maintained access to multiple domain and
local system accounts with varying permissions that were used throughout their
operations.
An actor created a new domain account and added it to the domain administrators
group.
Escalate Privileges

8/30

Although Mandiant has observed multiple cases where MAZE intrusion operators employed
Mimikatz to collect credentials to enable privilege escalation, these efforts have also been
bolstered in multiple cases via use of Bloodhound, and more manual searches for files
containing credentials.
Less than two weeks after initial access, the actor downloaded and interacted with an
archive named mimi.zip, which contained files corresponding to the credential
harvesting tool Mimikatz. In the following days the same mimi.zip archive was identified
on two domain controllers in the impacted environment.
The actor attempted to find files with the word “password” within the environment.
Additionally, several archive files were also created with file names suggestive of
credential harvesting activity.
The actor attempted to identify hosts running the KeePass password safe software.
Across multiple incidents, the Bloodhound utility was used, presumably to assess
possible methods of obtaining credentials with domain administrator privileges.
Actors primarily used Procdump and Mimikatz to collect credentials used to enable
later stages of their intrusion. Notably, both Bloodhound and PingCastle were also
used, presumably to enable attackers' efforts to understand the impacted organization's
Active Directory configuration. In this case the responsible actors also attempted to
exfiltrate collected credentials to multiple different cloud file storage services.
Reconnaissance
Mandiant has observed a broad range of approaches to network, host, data, and Active
Directory reconnaissance across observed MAZE incidents. The varied tools and
approaches across these incidents maybe best highlights the divergent ways in which the
responsible actors interact with victim networks.
In some intrusions, reconnaissance activity occurred within three days of gaining initial
access to the victim network. The responsible actor executed a large number of
reconnaissance scripts via Cobalt Strike to collect network, host, filesystem, and
domain related information.
Multiple built-in Windows commands were used to enable network, account, and host
reconnaissance of the impacted environment, though the actors also supplied and
used Advanced IP Scanner and Adfind to support this stage of their operations.
Preliminary network reconnaissance has been conducted using a batch script named
'2.bat' which contained a series of nslookup commands. The output of this script was
copied into a file named '2.txt'.
The actor exfiltrated reconnaissance command output data and documents related to
the IT environment to an attacker-controlled FTP server via an encoded PowerShell
script.
Over a period of several days, an actor conducted reconnaissance activity using
Bloodhound, PowerSploit/PowerView (Invoke-ShareFinder), and a reconnaissance
script designed to enumerate directories across internal hosts.
9/30

An actor employed the adfind tool and a batch script to collect information about their
network, hosts, domain, and users. The output from this batch script (2adfind.bat) was
saved into an archive named 'ad.7z' using an instance of the 7zip archiving utility
named 7.exe.
An actor used the tool smbtools.exe to assess whether accounts could login to systems
across the environment.
An actor collected directory listings from file servers across an impacted environment.
Evidence of data exfiltration was observed approximately one month later, suggesting
that the creation of these directory listings may have been precursor activity, providing
the actors with data they may have used to identify sensitive data for future exfiltration.
Lateral Movement
Across the majority of MAZE ransomware incidents lateral movement was accomplished via
Cobalt Strike BEACON and using previously harvested credentials. Despite this uniformity,
some alternative tools and approaches were also observed.
Attackers relied heavily on Cobalt Strike BEACON to move laterally across the
impacted environment, though they also tunneled RDP using the ngrok utility, and
employed tscon to hijack legitimate rdp sessions to enable both lateral movement and
privilege escalation.
The actor moved laterally throughout some networks leveraging compromised service
and user accounts obtained from the system on which they gained their initial foothold.
This allowed them to obtain immediate access to additional systems. Stolen credentials
were then used to move laterally across the network via RDP and to install BEACON
payloads providing the actors with access to nearly one hundred hosts.
An actor moved laterally using Metasploit and later deployed a Cobalt Strike payload to
a system using a local administrator account.
At least one actor attempted to perform lateral movement using EternalBlue in early
and late 2019; however, there is no evidence that these attempts were successful.
Complete Mission
There was evidence suggesting data exfiltration across most analyzed MAZE ransomware
incidents. While malicious actors could monetize stolen data in various way (e.g. sale in an
underground forum, fraud), actors employing MAZE are known to threaten the release of
stolen data if victim organizations do not pay an extortion fee.
An actor has been observed exfiltrating data to FTP servers using a base64-encoded
PowerShell script designed to upload any files with .7z file extensions to a predefined
FTP server using a hard-coded username and password. This script appears to be a
slight variant of a script first posted to Microsoft TechNet in 2013.
A different base64-encoded PowerShell command was also used to enable this
functionality in a separate incident.
10/30

Actors deploying MAZE ransomware have also used the utility WinSCP to exfiltrate
data to an attacker-controlled FTP server.
An actor has been observed employing a file replication utility and copying the stolen
data to a cloud file hosting/sharing service.
Prior to deploying MAZE ransomware threat actors employed the 7zip utility to archive
data from across various corporate file shares. These archives were then exfiltrated to
an attacker-controlled server via FTP using the WinSCP utility.
In addition to data theft, actors deploy MAZE ransomware to encrypt files identified on the
victim network. Notably, the aforementioned MAZE panel has an option to specify the date
on which ransom demands will double, likely to create a sense of urgency to their demands.
Five days after data was exfiltrated from a victim environment the actor copied a MAZE
ransomware binary to 15 hosts within the victim environment and successfully
executed it on a portion of these systems.
Attackers employed batch scripts and a series to txt files containing host names to
distribute and execute MAZE ransomware on many servers and workstations across
the victim environment.
An actor deployed MAZE ransomware to tens of hosts, explicitly logging into each
system using a domain administrator account created earlier in the intrusion.
Immediately following the exfiltration of sensitive data, the actors began deployment of
MAZE ransomware to hosts across the network. In some cases, thousands of hosts
were ultimately encrypted. The encryption process proceeded as follows:
A batch script named start.bat was used to execute a series of secondary batch
scripts with names such as xaa3x.bat or xab3x.bat.
Each of these batch scripts contained a series of commands that employed the
copy command, WMIC, and PsExec to copy and execute a kill script
(windows.bat) and an instance of MAZE ransomware (sss.exe) on hosts across
the impacted environment
Notably, forensic analysis of the impacted environment revealed MAZE
deployment scripts targeting ten times as many hosts as were ultimately
encrypted.
Implications
Based on our belief that the MAZE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we
anticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will
continue to vary somewhat, particularly in terms of the initial intrusion vector. For more
comprehensive recommendations for addressing ransomware, please refer to
our Ransomware Protection and Containment Strategies blog post and the linked white
paper.

MITRE ATT&CK Mappings
Mandiant currently tracks three separate clusters of activity involved in the post-compromise
distribution of MAZE ransomware. Future data collection and analysis efforts may reveal
additional groups involved in intrusion activity supporting MAZE operations, or may instead
allow us to collapse some of these groups into larger clusters. It should also be noted that
‘initial access’ phase techniques have been included in these mappings, though in some
cases this access may have been provided by a separate threat actor(s).
