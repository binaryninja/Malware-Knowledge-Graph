June 10, 2021

This month’s patch update covers 50 vulnerabilities, with 6 of them actively exploited – the
highest number we’ve seen so far in 2021. Five of these in-the-wild exploits affect default
Windows components, and one is a zero-day targeting MSHTML. All of them should be
reviewed and prioritized quickly to protect against an attack.
Also of note: Due to the severity of one of the in-the-wild threats, Microsoft pushed out a
cumulative out-of-band update for CVE-2021-33741 on June 4 (right before this month’s
Patch Tuesday release). This vulnerability uses the Internet Explorer HTML engine to
execute commands on affected systems and could occur within any application using
MSHTML to render HTML content. We’ve included this CVE in our vulnerability review this
month under “Other Important Vulnerabilities to Consider,” as this update was released last
week.
With the multiple active exploits for Windows, extra consideration should be given to
expediting patching on these systems.
Let’s get started.

1/7

New Patches for 50 Vulnerabilities
This month’s Patch Tuesday update includes fixes for 50 vulnerabilities. As with last month, it
is unfortunate that Microsoft chose to patch a low quantity of vulnerabilities, considering the
high number of active exploits occurring. And again we see remote code execution and
elevation of privilege as the top two types of vulnerabilities, which we also saw in May. The
charts below show the breakdown of impact types for May and June 2021.

Six Vulnerabilities Exploited in the Wild
Let’s examine in detail the six in-the-wild vulnerabilities being exploited in this Patch Tuesday
update.
CVE-2021-33742
CVE-2021-33742 is a Critical remote code execution vulnerability in the MSHTML engine,
which powers Internet Explorer (IE). Although IE’s retirement has been announced by
Microsoft, browsing activity, while low, is still active — hence we’ll likely still see patches for
MSHTML. This time, we see updates for all Windows versions: 10, 8.1, 7, Server 2019,
2016, 2012 and 2008. CrowdStrike recommends patching this vulnerability first by installing
applicable security updates to your platform.
CVE-2021-33739
CVE-2021-33739 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability for Microsoft DWM Core Library
dwm.exe and dwmcore.dll. It was found and reported by researchers in the wild. There are
indicators of it being a variant of CVE-2021-28310. The community has attributed it to the
Bitter APT group (tracked by CrowdStrike as HAZY TIGER), and a security patch for CVE2021-28310 was released in April Patch Tuesday.
CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956

3/7

Vulnerabilities CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 are possibly chained together to
achieve information leak and privilege escalation in the Windows Kernel context. Although
the CVE-2021-31955 is only applicable to the newer Windows 10 and Server 2019, CVE2021-31956 has patches released for as far back as Windows 7 and Server 2008.
CVE-2021-31199 and CVE-2021-31201
CVE-2021-31199 and CVE-2021-31201 are privilege escalation vulnerabilities that occur in
Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider. These vulnerabilities were caught in the wild
and were likely chained together with Adobe Reader CVE-2021-28550 to escape the
sandbox. (Enhanced Provider is an essential part of all Windows systems that supports more
robust security through longer keys.) Related patches have been rolled out for all Windows
versions – 10, 8.1, 7, Server 2019, 2016, 2012, 2008.
Further inspection shows that the range of attack types for this particular collection of CVEs
includes a remote code execution, four privilege escalations and an information leak.
Fortunately, most attackers wouldn’t be able to gain access to critical systems without an
existing footprint in those systems; however, it remains vitally important to prioritize these
patches to improve your security posture for hosts containing these Windows systems and
applications.

Four More Critical CVEs
In addition to CVE-2021-33742 already discussed, Microsoft has released patches for four
more Critical CVEs.

4/7

Two of these vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-31967 and CVE-2021-31985, will be updated
automatically, without any action required. CVE-2021-31967 is a remote code execution
vulnerability in the VP9 Video Extensions. This component is distributed from the Microsoft
Store and will automatically be updated if enabled. CVE-2021-31985 is a remote code
execution vulnerability in Microsoft Defender. This vulnerability will only be applicable if
Microsoft Defender is enabled on the system. According to Microsoft, this vulnerability will be
patched under automated updates for Defender.
CVE-2021-31963 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint
Server. This is one of six SharePoint vulnerabilities disclosed this month, continuing the
SharePoint activity seen in recent months. The remaining SharePoint vulnerabilities have
CVSS scores ranging from 5.7 to 7.6, with impacts including information disclosure, spoofing
and remote code execution. It’s important to note that Microsoft released a standalone set of
Sharepoint security updates to fix these vulnerabilities. These security updates are not
patched by OS updates. Because of this, organizations should consider accelerating
Sharepoint updates.
CVE-2021-31959 is a memory corruption vulnerability in the Scripting Engine. This
vulnerability also has patches released for all Windows versions: 10, 8.1, 7, Server 2019,
2016, 2012 and 2008.

The Impact and Importance of Patching
With the broad number of active, exploited vulnerabilities, organizations could be exposed
unless they take an active role in patching the hosts containing the above-listed
vulnerabilities. Default configuration systems are impacted and variants of the previously
disclosed CVEs have been uncovered — this should alert IT staff that these vulnerabilities
are not to be taken lightly.
Of course, if immediate patching isn’t possible, take appropriate action to defend your hosts
and servers until you can install the proper security updates.
Finally, if you have hosts still using Internet Explorer, take action to sunset the browser
completely.

About CVSS Scores
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free and open industry standard that
CrowdStrike and many other cybersecurity organizations use to assess and communicate
software vulnerabilities’ severity and characteristics. The CVSS Base Score ranges from 0.0
to 10.0, and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) adds a severity rating for CVSS
scores. Learn more about vulnerability scoring in this article.
