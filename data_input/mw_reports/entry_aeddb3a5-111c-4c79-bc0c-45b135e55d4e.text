Cosmic Lynx
The Rise of Russian BEC

© Copyright 2020 Agari Data, Inc.

Executive Summary
At some point, Russian and Eastern European cybercriminals are going to start
thinking to themselves, ‘Why am I spending all of this time and money setting
up infrastructure and hiring malware developers when I can just send someone
an email, ask them to send me money, and they’ll do it.’
For more than a year, this is a line we have used over and over again, expecting that some
of the world’s most dangerous cybercriminals would move into the world of business email
compromise (BEC) because the return on investment for basic social engineering attacks is
much higher than more sophisticated malware-based attacks. For the first time, this report
shows how these expectations have now become a reality, detailing a Russian criminal
organization we call Cosmic Lynx.

Cosmic Lynx exploits DMARC controls to spoof the email addresses of impersonated CEOs,
making their attacks appear much more authentic. For organizations that have implemented an
established DMARC policy set to reject (p=reject) or quarantine (p=quarantine), Cosmic Lynx
modifies the display name impersonating a CEO to include their email address, which still gives
it the look that the email is coming from the CEO’s account.
Domains registered by Cosmic Lynx are named in a way to mimic secure email and network
infrastructure (e.g., secure-mail-gateway[.]cc, encrypted-smtp-transport[.]cc, mx-secure-net[.]
com). The mailbox referenced in a Cosmic Lynx email address usually references celestial
bodies, like planets and stars--hence the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx-- similar to the naming
convention of some SMTP or DNS name servers.
To make their infrastructure more resilient and mask their identity in Whois records, Cosmic
Lynx has registered a number of their domains with NiceVPS, a bulletproof hosting and
anonymous domain provider. Cosmic Lynx’s infrastructure has also been linked to other types
of malicious activity, including Emotet and Trickbot banking Trojans, Android click fraud
malware, a popular carding marketplace, and Russian fake document websites.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

Cosmic Lynx employs a dual impersonation scheme. The pretext of their attacks is that the
target organization is preparing to close an acquisition with an Asian company as part of a
corporate expansion. First, they impersonate a company’s CEO, asking the target employee to
work with “external legal counsel” to coordinate the payments needed to close the acquisition.
Then, Cosmic Lynx hijacks the identity of a legitimate attorney at a UK-based law firm whose
job it is to facilitate the transaction. Cosmic Lynx prefers to use mule accounts in Hong Kong to
receive stolen funds. The group is actively resistant to using mule accounts in the United States,
but has provided secondary accounts located in Hungary, Portugal, and Romania.

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

We have observed more than 200 BEC campaigns linked to Cosmic Lynx since July
2019, targeting individuals in 46 countries on six continents. Unlike most BEC groups that
are relatively target agnostic, Cosmic Lynx has a clear target profile: large, multinational
organizations. Nearly all of the organizations Cosmic Lynx has targeted have a significant global
presence and many of them are Fortune 500 or Global 2000 companies. The target employees
of Cosmic Lynx are senior-level executives. Like other BEC groups, it seems Cosmic Lynx
identifies employees to target based on their title. Three quarters of employees targeted by
Cosmic Lynx hold the titles of Vice President, General Manager, or Managing Director.

The Missing Lynx
Inside a Cosmic Lynx Attack
Every single day, researchers in the Agari Cyber Intelligence Division (ACID) engage with
dozens of BEC scammers who have tried (and failed) to target Agari customers. In doing so,
we collect rich intelligence that allows us to better understand cybercriminal group operations,
uncover the identities of those involved in the criminal schemes, discover and track the
evolution of their methods over time, and unravel the financial infrastructure they use to launder
stolen proceeds.
Over the last year, ACID has identified more than 200 BEC campaigns targeting businesses
all over the world that are attributed to a sophisticated group of BEC actors we refer to as
“Cosmic Lynx.” This report details the tactics used by the group as well as our assessment
about the attribution of the group’s location.

Example initial email from Cosmic Lynx.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

The pretext used in nearly all Cosmic Lynx BEC attacks is that the company is preparing to
close an acquisition with an Asian company as part of corporate expansion. Impersonating the
company’s CEO, Cosmic Lynx asks the target employee to work with “external legal counsel”
to coordinate the payments necessary to close the acquisition. Of course, due to the sensitive
nature of this acquisition, the target employee is asked to keep the details of this transaction
confidential until it has been finalized.

4

This is where Cosmic Lynx deploys their second round of impersonation. Instead of developing
an independent legal persona, Cosmic Lynx hijacks the identities of real attorneys at highprofile law firms to add another layer of legitimacy to their attack. Nearly all of the attorneys
impersonated by Cosmic Lynx are based in the United Kingdom.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

Once the “CEO” has introduced the request to the target employee, the next step in a Cosmic
Lynx attack is to introduce the “lawyer” that will be assisting with the payments for the fake
acquisition. The “lawyer” generally introduces himself in a separate email and gives the target a
general overview of how the transaction will proceed.

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

One of the first things that stands out in a Cosmic Lynx attack is that they are extremely wellwritten. Unlike most BEC emails that are riddled with misspelled words and grammatical errors,
Cosmic Lynx emails are usually very detailed and written in nearly perfect English. In some
cases, Cosmic Lynx uses words that are likely not in most people’s vocabulary, like “accretive”
and “synergistic,” and uses them in their proper context. It should be noted that although
Cosmic Lynx’s targets are located all over the world, nearly all of the emails sent by the group
are written in English. The only exception to this we have identified were a handful of emails
written in French that were sent to a few targets in France.

5

Second, to mimic the impersonated attorney’s communication patterns as closely as possible,
Cosmic Lynx creates a detailed email signature that contains a picture of the impersonated
lawyer, a link to the legitimate law firm’s website, and a confidentiality disclaimer. An analysis
of the signatures indicates they are likely created using a freely available online signature
generator. The attorney’s photo is copied directly from the law firm’s actual website.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

Cosmic Lynx employs two strategies to make communications from the impersonated lawyer
more convincing. First, the group registers a domain that closely resembles the law firm’s actual
domain and create an email address on this domain to communicate with a target. For example,
if an attorney’s real email address is john.doe@lawfirm.com, Cosmic Lynx would create an
account like john.doe@lawfirmllp.com to communicate with an employee.

To better understand how a BEC threat actor will adapt, we commonly give them reasons why
a payment to their first mule account is not possible. In typical cases, BEC actors who originally
provide an international bank account will follow up with a secondary mule account that is
located in the US or the same country as the target. For Cosmic Lynx, though, they seem to
be consciously resistant to provide mule accounts in certain countries, like the US. Even when
we give them no other options, the group actively refuses to disclose mule accounts in the US.
This could mean that either the group does not have a supply of mules in the US or for other
reasons, they prefer not to use bank accounts in the US to receive illicit funds. Outside Hong
Kong, secondary accounts provided by Cosmic Lynx have been located in Hungary, Portugal,
and Romania.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

Based on our engagements with the group, it is clear their preference is to have a target send
payments to mule accounts located in Hong Kong, which has become a common source of
international mule accounts over the past few years. In every successful engagement we have
initiated with Cosmic Lynx, the initial mule account they have provided to us has been located
in Hong Kong.

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

The final phase of a Cosmic Lynx BEC attack is getting the target employee to send one or
more payments to mule accounts controlled by the group. A characteristic of Cosmic Lynx
attacks that sticks out is the amount of money they request. The average amount requested in
most executive impersonation BEC attacks is $55,000. Cosmic Lynx, on the other hand, asks for
hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars.

A Global Threat
A Look at Cosmic Lynx’s Targets
Typical BEC groups tend to be agnostic when selecting targets for their attacks. They are
more interested in identifying employees who have access to money, regardless if they work
for a small, five-person company or an organization with thousands of employees. In contrast,
Cosmic Lynx has a clear target preference: large, multinational organizations. Nearly all of the
target organizations we have identified have a global presence and many of them are Fortune
500 or Global 2000 companies. These target organizations are headquartered in 20 countries;
however, because most of the organizations are global, employees targeted by Cosmic Lynx
BEC campaigns are located in 46 countries on six continents. Even employees in countries not
typically seen in phishing campaign targeting sets, like Namibia and Mongolia, were targeted by
Cosmic Lynx.

To identify employees to target with BEC attacks, groups generally use legitimate commercial
services that allow them to conduct a finely tuned search for employees based on a number
of variables, such as title, location, and company revenue. Based on a review of employees
targeted by Cosmic Lynx, it is clear that they are using a similar service to identify targets
specifically by their title.
All of the employees targeted in Cosmic Lynx BEC campaigns are senior-level employees at
a company. Three quarters of employees targeted hold the titles of Vice President, General
Manager, or Managing Director at a company. Other positions explicitly targeted by Cosmic
Lynx include CEO (generally, subsidiary or country-level CEOs), CFO, and President. Because
Cosmic Lynx is focused on large, global companies, another interesting aspect of their attacks
is that they rarely target employees multiple times. Instead, they will target employees with the
same title at a company located in different countries.

Hitting D-MARC
How Cosmic Lynx Exploits DMARC Controls
The DMARC standard was created to prevent malicious actors from directly spoofing an
organization’s domain when sending an email. The standard was published in 2012 and
allows organizations to authenticate legitimate email messages and sources for their emailsending domains and publish explicit policies that instruct mailbox providers what to do with
inauthentic messages. The most aggressive DMARC policy is “reject” (p=reject), which means
that email messages that do not pass DMARC authentication will be rejected by a mail server
and not delivered to a user. In essence, with an effective DMARC policy at reject, cybercriminals
are not able to directly spoof an organization’s domain.
While spoofed domains can be used to create very realistic-looking phishing emails, very few
BEC attacks leverage spoofed domains. In our latest quarterly Email Fraud & Identity Deception
Trends report, we found that 96% of all BEC attacks used free webmail accounts or registered
domains to send malicious emails.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

If a company has not implemented a DMARC policy or has a policy set to monitor-only
(p=none), Cosmic Lynx will directly spoof the CEO’s email address and set the Reply-To
email to their operational email account they use to actually correspond with a victim. If an
organization has an established DMARC policy set to reject or quarantine (p=quarantine),
Cosmic Lynx will not spoof the sending email address. Instead, the group changes the display
name impersonating the CEO to include their email address, which still gives the look that the
email is coming directly from the CEO’s account (e.g., “John Smith - jsmith@acme.com”).

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

Cosmic Lynx, though, is part of the 4% of attacks to exploit organizations that do not have an
established DMARC policy. This enhances the authenticity of their emails by directly spoofing
the email addresses of CEOs when possible. Based on our analysis of historical Cosmic Lynx
attacks, it is clear that the group is aware of which target organizations have implemented an
effective DMARC policy and which organizations have not.

Exploiting a Pandemic
How Cosmic Lynx Has Leveraged COVID-19
in Their Attacks
Phishing attacks exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic started to skyrocket in March 2020.
Malware campaigns, credential phishing lures, and BEC attacks all started adopting COVID-19
themes as a way to increase the success rate of their attacks. Cosmic Lynx was no different.
In late-March, the group began inserting language referencing the pandemic into their BEC
campaign emails as a social-engineering icebreaker that preceded their main request. Because
COVID-19 has impacted nearly everyone in the world, it afforded Cosmic Lynx an opportunity
to disarm a target’s suspicions by building rapport with them at the beginning of an initial email
regardless of where the target was located. Some of the pandemic-themed content used by
Cosmic Lynx included the following:

I trust this emails (sic) finds you safe and well. The current situation
with the COVID-19 virus has all of us worried.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

With the unpredictable and fluid situation around COVID-19,
the world is navigating through an uncertain period with few
precedents. We are deeply concerned about the pandemic’s
impact on our business and our employees’ health and have rolled
out several mitigation measures.

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

The COVID-19 pandemic is a truly unprecedented situation which
affects us all but we are doing everything possible to provide
a safe working environment to our people, and to minimize its
negative impact on our business.

13

As the peak of the pandemic passed for most countries by late-May, Cosmic Lynx shifted their
tone and began referencing the reopening of global economies as an introduction to their
emails. Like the earlier references to COVID-19, these introductions are meant to get a target to
put down their defenses before the Cosmic Lynx actor gets to what they really want. Some of
the introductions used by Cosmic Lynx after the COVID-19 peak included the following:

As the world emerges from lockdown restrictions, we are
cautiously optimistic that the worst is finally behind us.

“As countries around the world gradually ease lockdown
restrictions and companies resume business, we must now
look beyond the crisis and position ourselves for the economic
recovery.”

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

Prior to the global rise of COVID-19, Cosmic Lynx’s emails were rather generic, which makes
their pivot to pandemic themes that much more notable. Like many cybercriminals out there,
this indicates they are savvy enough to pay attention to global events and adapt their attacks
to exploit them.

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

“The last many weeks have been very challenging but the worst is
most likely over as normalcy is gradually returning with countries
easing restrictions. We anticipate a robust rebound in the economy
and are seizing the opportunity to further develop our business.”

Putting the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx
A Look at Cosmic Lynx’s Operational Infrastructure
Attacker infrastructure is another one of the key differences between Cosmic Lynx and other
BEC groups. While most BEC actors tend to gravitate to free webmail accounts or remotelyhosted cloud services, Cosmic Lynx consistently chooses to host their own email infrastructure
with a small number of hosting providers. By hosting, managing, controlling, and running
their own email infrastructure, Cosmic Lynx is able to be more resistant to law enforcement
operations which may target their campaigns.

Putting the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx
Email addresses created by Cosmic Lynx to send their campaigns seem to mimic secure email
and network infrastructure. The mailbox referenced in a Cosmic Lynx email address (the part
of an email address before the “@”) usually references celestial bodies, like planets and stars-hence the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx--similar to the naming convention of some SMTP or DNS
name servers. Examples of these mailbox names include “smtp-mars,” “mx-taurus,” “tls-sirius,”
and gateway-mercury.”
Similarly, domains registered by Cosmic Lynx are named in a way to impersonate secure email
infrastructure (e.g., secure-mail-gateway[.]cc, encrypted-smtp-transport[.]cc, mx-secure-net[.]
com). In some cases, Cosmic Lynx has referenced Fortinet, a US-based cybersecurity that
offers endpoint security and secure email gateway products, in their domains (e.g., fortinethost-protection[.]cc, fortinet-server[.]cc, fortinet-gateway[.]cc).

Most BEC actors simply purchase a domain or use a free webmail account, with attackers
frequently cycling through accounts and domains as they’re taken down. Cosmic Lynx
purchases domains too; however, they put much more work and effort into securing the
infrastructure from outsiders investigating the domains.
Cosmic Lynx makes heavy use of DNS MX records for their email accounts to manipulate mail
flow. After Cosmic Lynx registers their domain for a specific campaign, the attackers point the
top-level domain (TLD) at Cloudflare to make the domain appear more legitimate. Next, the
attackers create a subdomain to use as the MX record, or the place where emails will be sent
and delivered. By modifying the IP address that the subdomain is pointing to, Cosmic Lynx is
able to point part of the domain at seemingly legitimate infrastructure, while running scams
under the subdomain.

Manipulating Email Flow, Not Just for Email Engineers

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

16

This is a key differentiator when comparing traditional BEC actors and Cosmic Lynx, as true
understanding of how email flow and editing DNS records is a skill that far exceeds traditional
BEC actors.

DMARC: Not Just for the Good Guys
While Cosmic Lynx is more than happy to spoof email infrastructure to target an organization
with a BEC attempt, the attackers aren’t fans of having someone else spoof their infrastructure.
Cosmic Lynx is able to monitor for any attempts at spoofing their domain by using properlyconfigured DMARC policies on their domain infrastructure. In a vast majority of cases, Cosmic
Lynx DMARC domains are configured to send spoofs to abuse@[domain], with variations
including legal@[domain] and dmarc@[domain]. By using these email accounts, not only
does Cosmic Lynx receive a copy of any person trying to spoof them, but they could fool
unsuspecting users into reporting fraud attacks to them, too.

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

Additionally, if DMARC is not enabled, anyone is able to spoof the origins of the sending
domain. By having this security feature disabled, spam bots and other parties are able to piggyback on the reputation of the sending domain, which would negatively impact the reputation of
the sending domain. In the case of Cosmic Lynx, their entire existence in the BEC space relies
on emails landing in the inboxes of users, and if their delivery domains have poor Senderbase
Reputation Scores (SBRS), most security appliances will refuse or flag these emails as being
suspicious.

17

Fortifying Infrastructure with Bulletproof Hosting
In order to make their infrastructure more resilient and mask their identity in WHOIS records,
Cosmic Lynx has registered a number of their domains with NiceVPS, a bulletproof hosting and
anonymous domain provider. Based on a review of other domains registered with NiceVPS, it is
clear that the service caters to cybercriminals.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

Instead of using basic Whois privacy when registering a domain, NiceVPS registers a domain
on their customers’ behalf with their anonymous domain name service, adding an additional
layer of anonymity between the domain and Cosmic Lynx. Instead of showing masked
registrant details, a domain’s Whois record will just show contact details for NiceVPS, under the
organization name “Nice IT Services Group Inc.” NiceVPS also does not require registrants to
provide any personal information when registering a domain and purchases can be made using
bitcoin, making it even harder to track someone’s identity.

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

To make the infrastructure more friendly for scammers, NiceVPS makes use of a warrant canary,
which will let users know if information has been subpoenaed or requested by law enforcement.
If the warrant canary is not updated after a pre-determined period of time, this will tip the users
of the infrastructure off that law enforcement intervention may be happening, giving attackers
time to react and clean up their tracks.

One of the more notable aspects of Cosmic Lynx’s BEC infrastructure is its links to other types
of malicious activity, particularly malware infrastructure. Because Cosmic Lynx controls their
infrastructure so closely, this may indicate deeper connections to the criminal underground that
have not been observed by previous BEC actors.
Between December 2019 and April 2020, two of Cosmic Lynx’s mail servers, vmc[.]fortinetprotection[.]cc and cx[.]fortinet-gateway[.]cc, were hosted on IP address 46[.]249[.]62[.]202.
This time frame overlaps with two other domains, adsclubpartners[.]ru and 00xff[.]net, hosted
at this IP address that were used to host configuration files for Russian click fraud malware
targeting Android mobile devices.
Between December 2019 and January 2020, one of Cosmix Lynx’s mail servers, vs[.]secure-mxgateway[.]cc, was hosted on IP address 93[.]158[.]208[.]104. In October 2019, two months prior
to Cosmic Lynx infrastructure pointed to the IP address, a sample of Trickbot, one of today’s
most active banking Trojans, was seen making SSL connections to this IP address, indicating
this address may have been used as a command and control (C2) server.

Between January 2020 and February 2020, one of Cosmic Lynx’s mail servers, vs[.]mxgateway-host[.]cc resolved to IP address 46[.]249[.]59[.]67. Around June 2019, this IP address
was hosting Azorult malware, which is capable of stealing chat messages, browser history,
and financial information. Between March 2019 and October 2019, this IP address also hosted
mrgreen[.]ws, a carding marketplace that has been in operation since 2014.
Malware authors and other cybercriminals frequently cycle through infrastructure and in some
cases, infrastructure is used for a single attack or campaign, so we cannot link Cosmic Lynx
actors to these other malicious activities directly. Associations to infrastructure connected
to more sophisticated malicious activity across multiple service providers is notable, though,
because we generally do not see these types of links with other BEC groups.

multiple malicious word documents linked to the Emotet banking Trojan were observed being
downloaded from the IP address.

Who is Cosmic Lynx?
Exposing Cosmic Lynx’s Russian Origin
Historically, a vast majority of BEC attacks have originated from actors in Nigeria. Looking
at Cosmic Lynx’s attacks, though, it is clear they are a different breed than other active
cybercriminal groups conducting BEC operations. Our assessment finds that Cosmic Lynx is
likely composed of Russia-based actors, based on analysis of their attacks and infrastructure.

As we discussed earlier, some of the infrastructure used by Cosmic Lynx to send BEC emails
overlaps with infrastructure used by Trickbot and Emotet malware, which is believed to be tied
to Russian actors. In addition to these potential connections, we have also observed multiple
instances where IP addresses linked to Cosmic Lynx’s BEC domain have overlapped with
infrastructure used to host Russian fake document websites. These sites, which seem to be
catering to individuals in Russia and Ukraine, sell a variety of false Russian-language documents,
such as diplomas, birth certificates, and death certificates.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

Cosmic Lynx email header with Moscow Standard Time UTC offset.

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

The first piece of evidence that ties back to a Russian nexus is the time/date stamp in the
email headers of some of the Cosmic Lynx attacks. Generally, the Date field in an email header
reflects the time and date an email was sent and usually includes a UTC offset. While this UTC
offset can be modified by either the sender or routing infrastructure, in many cases this offset
will reflect the time zone of the sender. For many of the Cosmic Lynx attacks we have analyzed,
the UTC offset in the email headers are set to +0300 (MSK), which corresponds to Moscow
Standard Time. Moscow Standard Time is only observed in the eastern parts of Russia, as well
as Belarus and very small parts of Georgia and Ukraine. Since none of the routing infrastructure
used by Cosmic Lynx or their targets are located in Russia, and it is unlikely an actor would
spoof an MSK offset, we assess that this is the likely time zone of the sender(s) of these
messages.

While none of these pieces of evidence on their own would warrant a solid attribution case, we
believe looking at the totality of evidence together builds a strong circumstantial argument that
some, if not all, Cosmic Lynx actors are based in Russia.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

AGARI | COSMIC LYNX

The final piece of evidence pointing to Russian attribution comes from the metadata of
documents sent by Cosmic Lynx in some of their BEC attacks. During one of our engagements
with Cosmic Lynx, they sent us a document containing wire transfer instructions for a payment,
as well as a fake non-disclosure agreement. A review of the metadata of these documents
shows they were last saved by user “Serge Devant” prior to being sent to us. Serge Devant
is the name of a DJ from Saint Petersburg, Russia. While the name of this user can be easily
changed to reflect any name, using the name of a Russian DJ, regardless of whether it is
legitimate or not, is notable. It should be noted that we have no evidence that the real Serge
Devant is associated with Cosmic Lynx activity.

To protect against threats like these, organizations first need to
understand and accept the state of today’s cyber threat landscape.
Most email-based threats today, like BEC attacks, are very simple
social engineering attacks that are technically unsophisticated. To
effectively protect against these threats, companies need to make
sure they have defenses in place that are equipped to detect identity
deception attacks that traditional inbound filters are not accustomed
to handling. Additionally, organizations should have good internal
processes in place, so payment requests, regardless of source, are
verified before they are processed.

THREAT ACTOR DOSSIER

Business email compromise has become the predominant cyber
threat businesses face today. Since 2016, businesses have lost at least
$26 billion as a result of BEC attacks and, based on the most recent
FBI IC3 report, losses from BEC attacks grew another 37 percent in
2019, accounting for 40 percent of all cybercrime losses over the
course of the year. Evidence that more sophisticated threat groups
are adding BEC to their attack repertoire should concern everyone.
Unlike traditional BEC groups, Cosmic Lynx has demonstrated the
capability to develop much more complex and creative attacks
that sets them apart from other more generic BEC attacks we see
everyday.
