December 2, 2020

Executive Summary
IcedID stealer (Also known as BokBot) was first discovered at the end of 2017, believed to
be a resurgence of the NeverQuest banking Trojan. It is a modular banking trojan that uses
man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks to steal banking credentials, payment card information
and other financial data.
The stealer possesses relatively sophisticated functionality and capabilities such as web
injects, a large remote access trojan (RAT) arsenal and a VNC module for remote control.
Additionally, the use of steganography to hide configuration data along with anti-VM
detection and anti-debugging techniques complicate detection and analysis.
IcedID’s typical range of targets includes the customers of banks and telecommunications
organizations worldwide leading to impacts including brand abuse, funds theft and customer
data breaches.
Cyberint have recently observed an ongoing campaign targeting users in the APAC region
with an apparent focus on the Philippines and Japan.
The IcedID stealer is traditionally delivered by a malspam lure, with Microsoft Word
attachments weaponized with malicious Macros, based on Emotet.
While the majority of recently detected lure documents were written in English and targeted a
wide range of users, localized campaigns have also been reported. One such recent
example targeted users located in Japan with lure documents in Japanese, likely indicating
that the threat actor behind this threat is relatively sophisticated and may focus on specific
geographies as potential targets, adjusting their arsenal accordingly.

Whilst it is not possible to attribute IcedID to a specific group, past indications suggest a
potential link to the following threat actors:
Lunar Spider
TA2101

Delivery
As a generic malspam campaign that utilizes Emotet as the delivery mechanism, the lures
are comprised from a generic subject (quotation/request/Document/report) being sent to the
targeted user.
The email contains an attached ZIP folder protected by a password provided within the email
body. At the next stage, once the user extracts the document file from the ZIP folder, they will
be requested to ‘Enable Content’ (Figure 1) within Microsoft Word, leading to malicious
Macro code being executed whilst decoy content (Figure 2) is displayed.

Threat actor email address, used for the file creation
Once executed, the macro will write a variety of files to the drive, used for the download and
decryption of the latest IcedID trojan, including an up-to-date configuration file containing a
list of target bank and telecommunication organizations. In some cases, this was observed
as a DLL file, where in others it was a steganographically obfuscated PNG file (Figure 3).

Although surfaced in 2017, many iterations of this trojan have been well-investigated by
numerous security researchers globally, but for the past year (circa January 2020), several
new techniques were added in order to detect and evade sandboxes, and to generally hide
the execution process taking place.

It was also noticed that the malware creates a new folder with a random name, where it
saves a downloaded configuration in encrypted form (Figure 4).

Figure 4 – Download directory
Inside the %TEMP% folder, it drops some non-malicious helper elements: sqlite32.dll (that
will be used for reading SQLite browser databases found in web browsers), and a certificate
that will be used for intercepting traffic (Figure 5).

Infection
Once infected, the IcedID trojan, known as a banking Trojan, steals data related to banking
transactions by injecting implants into browsers, API hooks and a ‘Man-in-the-Browser’
(MitB)[1] attack to manipulate visited webpages.
As observed (Figure 6) in the memory of an infected host, the svchost process contains
strings that reveal the configuration of these ‘web-injects’, that being modular HTML and
JavaScript code elements that are injected into the webpage of a targeted brand to steal
data.

The core bot that runs inside the memory of the svchost process observes other processes
running on the system and injects implants into browsers, for example as seen in Mozilla
Firefox (Figure 7).
The IcedID module running inside the browser’s memory is responsible for applying the webinjects and installing malicious JavaScript into targeted webpages causing them to be
executed on the client side (Figure 8).

C2
The hooked scripts, loaded from modified browser DLLs, communicate with the main bot
process residing inside the svchost process. The main bot coordinates the work of all the
injected components and exfiltrates stolen data to the C2 server.
In order to properly hide and encrypt its communication processes, all C2 communications
are made over HTTPS using the trojan’s own certificate (Figure 9).

Recommendations
Notify customer care of the ongoing threat in case of funds loss.
Cyberint recommends that customers educate their end-users and always check for
unusual browser behaviors that may lead to account compromise or funds theft.
Phishing awareness to the end-users is advised.
Usage of a modern, updated AV solution is advised.
MFA should be enabled on all of the end-user accounts.
