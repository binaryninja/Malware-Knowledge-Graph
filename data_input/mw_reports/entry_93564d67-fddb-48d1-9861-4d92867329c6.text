Figure 1. The distribution of the types of apps that Facestealer disguise themselves as
We recently observed a number of apps on Google Play designed to perform malicious activities such as stealing user credentials and other
sensitive user information, including private keys. Because of the number and popularity of these apps — some of them have been installed
over a hundred thousand times — we decided to shed some light on what these apps actually do by focusing on some of the more notable
examples.

Password-stealing Facestealer variants disguised as fitness, photo editing, and other apps
The Facestealer spyware was first documented in July 2021 in a report by Dr. Web detailing how it stole Facebook credentials from users via
fraudulent apps from Google Play. These stolen credentials could then be used to compromise Facebook accounts for malicious purposes
such as phishing scams, fake posts, and ad bots. Similar to Joker, another piece of mobile malware, Facestealer changes its code frequently,
thus spawning many variants. Since its discovery, the spyware has continuously beleaguered Google Play.
During our recent research into malicious mobile apps, we encountered more than 200 additional apps of the Facestealer spyware in the Trend
Micro Mobile App Reputation Service (MARS) database.
One of the apps we found, named Daily Fitness OL, claims to be a fitness app, complete with exercises and video demonstrations. But like the
initial variant, it was designed to steal the Facebook credentials of its users.

When the app is launched, it sends a request to hxxps://sufen168[.]space/config to download its encrypted configuration. At the time of our
analysis, the returned configuration was:
`eXyJkIjowLCJleHQxIjoiNSw1LDAsMiwwIiwiZXh0MiI6IiIsImkiOjAsImlkIjoiMTE1NTYzNDk2MTkxMjE3MiIsImwiOjAsImxvZ2luX3BpY191cmxfc3dpdGNoIjowLCJsciI6Ijcw

After decryption, the real configuration was:
{"d":0,"ext1":"5,5,0,2,0","ext2":"","i":0,"id":"1155634961912172","l":0,"login_pic_url_switch":0,"lr":"70"}

The “l” in the configuration is the flag used to control whether a prompt appears to ask the user to log in to Facebook. Once the user logs in to
Facebook, the app launches a WebView (an embeddable browser) to load a URL, for example, hxxps://touch[.]facebook[.]com/home[.]php?
sk=h_nor, from the downloaded configuration. A piece of JavaScript code is then injected into the loaded webpage to steal the credentials
entered by the user.
After the user successfully logs in to an account, the app collects the cookie. The spyware then encrypts all the personally identifiable
information (PII) and sends it to the remote server. The encryption key and address of the remote server are all taken from the downloaded
configuration.

Another fake app, named Enjoy Photo Editor, shares many similar procedures with the Daily Fitness OL app. The primary methods of stealing
credentials, in particular, are the same: harvesting credentials by injecting JavaScript code and collecting cookies after the victims successfully
log in to their accounts. But this app differs by moving the downloading of the configuration and the uploading of victim credentials to the native
code while also obfuscating the app to make it more difficult to detect by security solutions.
We show screenshots of more Facestealer variants in the following figures. The Facestealer variants we found have already been taken down
by Google from Google Play as of this writing.

Fake cryptocurrency miner apps that collect private keys and mnemonic phrases
We also found more than 40 fake cryptocurrency miner apps that are variants of similar apps that we covered in a previous blog entry. These
apps are designed to deceive users into buying paid services or clicking on ads by luring them in with the prospect of bogus cryptocurrency
earnings.
Initially, after running tests on one of these new variants, named “Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin,” on our test device, we did not detect any
advertisements and requests for sensitive information or payment. However, upon clicking the “Connect Wallet” button in the app, we were
prompted to enter a private key (a digital signature used with an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data), which was enough of a red flag that we
decided to look into the app further.

Our investigation into the app’s manifest file revealed that it was developed using Kodular, a free online suite for mobile app development. In
fact, most of the fake cryptocurrency miner apps we previously analyzed were also developed using the same framework.

manifest file of Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin indicating that the app was developed using Kodular
Upon checking the code, we found that this app only loaded a website. And without any code to simulate mining, there was no way to
determine if the app was actually malicious. However, we decided to dig deeper, starting with the URL of the loaded site.

Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin
To facilitate further analysis, we tried opening this URL on a desktop web browser. At first glance, the loaded website appears to be quite
professionally done. It notifies users that they can participate in cloud-based cryptocurrency mining without any deposits. It also promises 500
gigahashes per second (Gh/s) computing power to users free of charge after they connect an active wallet.

Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin
The wallet connection page of the website assures users that their data will be encrypted with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and their
private keys will not be stored.

We entered a number of arbitrary private key strings for testing in the “Import by Currency” tab, and the results of the packet capture analysis
told us that the stated claims were false: The site not only uploaded an entered private key, but it also did so without any encryption.

server controlled by the malicious actors behind Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin
In addition to private keys, this site also steals mnemonic phrases (series of unrelated words that are generated when a cryptocurrency wallet
is created). These are typically used to recover cryptocurrency in case the user’s wallet is lost or damaged. In the case of fake apps such as
Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin or website such as the one loaded from this app, an entered mnemonic phrase is sent directly to the
malicious actors behind the app or website in question and is uploaded in clear text to their server. This procedure is similar to the fake
cryptocurrency wallet app scheme we discussed in a previous blog entry.

controlled by the malicious actors behind Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin
We located the code in the upload section of the app and confirmed that the site indeed uploads plain-text private keys or mnemonic phrases
to the server controlled by the operators of the app.

app
To lure users into signing up for the service, the site uses an airdrop for 0.1 ether (approximately US$240 at the time of this writing) as a bait.
The claim details of the airdrop cleverly state that a wallet can be claimed only once (so that a user has to bind multiple wallets) and the wallet
must have more than US$100 (so that the malicious actors behind the app have something to steal).

Coin to lure users into signing up for the app’s supposed service
To generate an air of legitimacy, the page is populated with likely fake comments by users mentioning that they successfully claimed their 0.1
ether.

Interestingly, upon checking the code showing the alleged creator of the webpage (seemingly mimicking the cryptocurrency wallet ecosystem
Klever), we found a hyperlink in the code that turned out to be the Twitter account of Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of Tesla, who is a wellknown cryptocurrency investor.

This app has already been taken down by Google as of the time of writing.
Conclusion and recommendations
Facestealer apps are disguised as simple tools — such as virtual private network (VPN), camera, photo editing, and fitness apps — making
them attractive lures to people who use these types of apps. Because of how Facebook runs its cookie management policy, we feel that these
types of apps will continue to plague Google Play.
As for the fake cryptocurrency miner apps, their operators not only try to profit from their victims by duping them into buying fake cloud-based
cryptocurrency-mining services, but they also try to harvest private keys and other sensitive cryptocurrency-related information from users who
are interested in what they offer. Looking into the future, we believe that other methods of stealing private keys and mnemonic phrases are
likely to appear.
Users can avoid such fake apps by checking their reviews, especially the negatives ones, to see if there are any unusual concerns or
experiences from actual users who have downloaded the apps. Users should also apply due diligence to the developers and publishers of
these apps, so that they can better avoid apps with dodgy websites or sketchy publishers, especially given the number of alternatives on the
app store. Finally, users should avoid downloading apps from third-party sources, since these are where many malicious actors host their
fraudulent apps.
Mobile users can help minimize the threats posed by these fraudulent apps through the use of Trend Micro Mobile Security Solutions, which
scan mobile devices in real time and on demand to detect malicious apps or malware to block or delete them. These apps are available on
both Android and iOS.
