(CNN)Several hospitals across the United States have been targeted in ransomware attacks
in what appears to be an escalation and expansion of similar attacks previously launched on
other hospitals and medical facilities.
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a warning advisory
Wednesday night regarding ransomware activity targeting health care facilities. On Twitter,
CISA said "there is an imminent and increased cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and
healthcare providers."
"CISA, FBI, and (the Department of Health and Human Services) have credible information
of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers,"
the advisory stated. "CISA, FBI, and HHS are sharing this information to provide warning to
healthcare providers to ensure that they take timely and reasonable precautions to protect
their networks from these threats."
A Trump administration official told CNN that some hospitals have already been affected.
Ransomware is a type of malware, or malicious software, that encrypts a victim's files. The
attacker then typically demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data upon
payment. Users are often shown instructions for how to pay a fee to get the decryption key.

The costs can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, often payable to
cybercriminals in Bitcoin.

Ransomware and other cyber attacks have seen a sharp rise this year, and hospitals have
been particularly vulnerable since the start of the global pandemic. Since July, hospitals in
states including New York, Nebraska, Ohio, Missouri and Michigan have all been attacked by
some form of ransomware.
A Trump administration official told CNN that several hospitals have been targeted in the
attacks over the past two days, and while it's still early, the official said the incidents may be
connected. The federal government is investigating the attacks, the official said.
So far, St. Lawrence Health Systems in New York and the Sky Lakes Medical Center in
Oregon confirmed to CNN that they were targeted over the past few days. The University of
Vermont Health Network said in a press release Thursday that it is experiencing a
"significant" and "ongoing" system-wide network issue, and is investigating all possible
causes, including "a malicious cyberattack."
Experts with Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm, said they identified at least three attacks on
Tuesday and one on Wednesday, with patients getting diverted to other hospitals as a result.
"We are experiencing the most significant cyber security threat we've ever seen in the United
States," Charles Carmakal, SVP and CTO of Mandiant, said. "An Eastern European
financially motivated threat actor, is deliberately targeting and disrupting U.S. hospitals,
forcing them to divert patients to other healthcare providers. Patients may experience
prolonged wait time to receive critical care."
Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst for the firm Recorded Future, told CNN that his company
knows of at least six attacks in the last 24 hours and "there are probably more."
It is "absolutely the biggest thing we've ever seen. In terms of ransomware it's the biggest
attack we've ever seen," he said, adding that it's "crushing to see so many hospitals hit at the
same time."
Chris Krebs, director of CISA, warned health care and public health individuals to have their
"shields up! Assume Ryuk is inside the house. Executives - be ready to activate business
continuity and disaster recovery plans. IT sec teams - patch, MFA, check logs, make sure
you have a good backup point."
In a statement from the St. Lawrence Health Systems, the virus has been identified as a new
variant of Ryuk ransomware, previously unknown to antivirus software providers and security
agencies.
It is not known who carried out the attacks, but overall, the incidents represent a solid
expansion of hospital targets in a short period of time who have sought to take advantage of
the crush facing hospitals in the wake of the global pandemic.
Ransomware can have devastating effects. Most recently, it crippled the IT network of a
German hospital resulting in the death of a woman seeking emergency treatment.
According to Microsoft Corporate Vice President for Customer Security and Trust Tom Burt,
Ryuk is a sophisticated crypto-ransomware because it identifies and encrypts network files
and disables Windows System Restore to prevent people from being able to recover from

the attack without external backups. Ryuk has been attacking organizations, including
municipal governments, state courts, hospitals, nursing homes, enterprises and large
universities.
According to Burt, Ryuk has been attributed to attacks targeting a contractor for the
Department of Defense, the North Carolina city of Durham, an IT provider for 110 nursing
homes and a number of hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Services, which was not targeted in the most recent attack.
