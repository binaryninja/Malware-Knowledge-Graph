Moroccan authorities arrested a suspect known in underground hacking circles as “Dr HeX”
on accusations of orchestrating a 12-year-old cybercrime spree that included website
defacements, phishing attacks, and malware distribution, Interpol announced today.
The arrest took place in May this year and was announced today as part of
Interpol’s Operation Lyrebird.
In a blog post today, cyber-security firm Group-IB said its analysts were the ones to
track down the hacker’s location.
Group-IB said it managed to link an email address used in one of Dr HeX’s phishing
kits to the suspect’s real-world identity.
Per the company’s researchers, the email address was used to register a public
YouTube channel, and the description of one of the videos hosted on this profile linked
to an Arabic crowd-funding platform.
In total, Group-IB said its investigation unearthed five email addresses and six public
nicknames used by the hacker, including accounts on Skype, Facebook, Instagram,
and YouTube.
These emails and public nicknames helped researchers track the suspect’s activities
back to 2009, when the threat actor began defacing public websites.
Subsequent sleuthing linked Dr HeX to phishing campaigns and intrusions at a French
corporation, from where Group-IB said the suspect tried to steal banking card data.

Other phishing and malware attacks also targeted French telecommunications
companies, major French banks, and several multinational corporations.
We have seen direct links between this actor #DrHeX in numerous credential phishing
kits and also using the ZombiBot SMTP Cracker.
The actor is also seen to be using code from other phishing kits in their own code
which we usually associate with less skilled actors.#Phishing https://t.co/BLjmZPLBPb
