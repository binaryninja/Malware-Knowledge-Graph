VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Welcome
Welcome to “VirusTotal’s 2021 Malware Trends Report” research report.
We hope that by sharing our visibility into the threat landscape that we
can help researchers, security practitioners, and the general public better
understand the evolution of malware attacks in 2021.
When facing online threats as complicated as those we face today,
defenders naturally struggle to see the whole picture. This partial view
makes it difficult to condense and analyze significant and rich data in a
single place and creates blind spots for defenders.
VirusTotal is in a unique position to provide a source of comprehensive
visibility. Over the last 16 years, we have processed more than 2 million
files per day across 232 countries. VirusTotal also harnesses the continuous
contribution of its community of users to provide relevant attack context.
We use this crowdsourced intelligence to analyze relevant data, share an
understanding of how attacks develop, and help inform how they might
evolve in the future.
This report continues in the direction of what we hope will become
an ongoing community effort to discover and share actionable information
on malware trends.
Methodology: VirusTotal relies on crowdsourced contributions,
providing a valuable picture of how different attacks spread and evolve.
All the data in this report is based on a representative subset of submissions
from our users. To be clear, the relevance of the raw number of samples
observed and detected as malicious varies throughout the course of the
year. Small changes in malicious samples driven by variances in contributors,
polymorphism, and external crawlers can result in significantly more
unique detections.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Executive Summary
Attackers’ use of malware with built-in exploits increased by 27% in 2021.
The average time it took for the most popular vulnerabilities to be exploited
dropped from 93 days in 2020 to 0 days in 2021 because many were being
exploited before their public announcement.
There was a more than 37% increase in the number of droppers used
in malware distribution. These increases were accompanied by a 20%
increase in infrastructure hosting malware, often on legitimate domains.
Attackers transitioned from Microsoft Word DOCX files to Microsoft Excel
XLSX files for malware distribution, largely due to increased usage of Excel
malicious spreadsheets with macros.
The overall number of malicious Android samples decreased. However, for
the first time we found a few Android samples among the most submitted
and researched samples of the year. We also observed an 146% increase in
the number of samples targeting Linux systems.

Log4j had a very noticeable impact both on attackers and defenders.
Even though the log4j vulnerability was not publicly revealed until December,
it shot to the top of the list of those vulnerabilities most often abused by
attackers in 2021. Four malware samples related to log4j attacks were found
in the top 10 for most looked up samples during the last quarter of the year.
The number of fresh CobaltStrike samples grew by 155%, mainly during
the first quarter of 2021, to be followed by a wave of VirusTotal users looking
those samples up for the rest of the year.
Families such as Dridex (1,306% increase in number of samples in 2021
compared to 2020) and Gozi (37% increase) bloomed, while others such
as Emotet (66% decrease), Qakbot (76% decrease) and Smokeloader
(73% decrease) greatly reduced the number of fresh samples during 2021.
We detected attackers rotating their RATs (Remote Access Trojans) and
backdoors of choice. Padodor/Berbew (2,111% increase in number of samples
in 2021 compared to 2020) is a clear outlier given its polymorphic nature and
its (suspected) code reuse by other malware families. AsyncRAT (+139%) and
Flyagent (+118%) increased in popularity among attackers. On the other hand,
the presence of Gravity RAT dropped 99% in 2021.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

At a Glance
In general, we didn’t observe any anomaly in the timeline for new samples
received and detected as malicious during 2020 and 2021. If anything, the
timeline is generally constant and reaches a plateau by the end of 2021.

Fig 1.
Malware submission timeline.

The number of potentially malicious samples (detected as such by five or
more different antivirus engines) first seen during the year is almost the
same between 2020 (45.86%) and in 2021 (46.12%). When checking the
percentage of malicious samples generating new malware clusters (by
similarity), which can provide clues to researchers as to how new malware
samples are different, we also find almost the same ratio (0.43% vs 0.44%).
We saw unexpected differences crop up, however, when we
compared samples of malicious files as explained in the section below.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

How malware distribution evolved
in 2021
In 2021 we observed the following distribution changes (compared to 2020)
for file types used by malicious samples:
+209%

+146%
+117%

+97%
+53%

+36%
PE

VBA

ELF

DLL

PDF

XLSX

Powershell

DOCX

Android

-25%

-28%

MACH-O

-5.3%

-97%
Fig 2.
2021 distribution changes for file types used by malicious samples.

Below we provide some ideas to explain these changes.
Windows executable files represent the vast majority of files considered
as malicious in VirusTotal. The percentage decrease of PE files in 2021 is
compensated by the combined increase in other formats. In particular, the
increase of DLL files might be read as a technicality to replace PEs in some
malware families. Interestingly, the percentage of PE samples implementing
any kind of exploit increased by 131%.
We also found a dramatic decrease (97%) in the number of macOSbased MACH-O malicious files. In this case, the explanation can be found in
the peak of ransomware “polymorphic” samples belonging to the EvilQuest
family distributed aggressively for macOS in mid-2020 and described in our
2021 report “Ransomware in a global context”. EvilQuest is no longer active
and there was no similar campaign in 2021, which explains the decrease in
the number of samples, but naturally there were new malware families for
macOS such as Macma, Xloader, and XcodeSpy.

{ 5 }

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Threat actors in 2021 changed from deploying malicious DOCX files
to malicious XLSX files. Both are some of the most common formats
for malware distributed as attachment. Many different campaigns in 2021
such as Emotet, Qakbot, Dridex, Zloader, and Trickbot relied on malicious
XLSX files to infect their victims. However, the number of files implementing
exploits in 2021 for both formats increased only for DOCX,
which seems counterintuitive.
We couldn’t find any technical reason for the transition, although we can
speculate that attackers might have decided to abuse formats victims are
less used to seeing in social engineering attacks. Finally, the increase in VBA
files corresponds to the high use of both formats for malware distribution
embedding malicious macros.

ELF files
implementing
exploits
increased

135%

The big increment in ELF malware seems to be mainly related to Mirai,
Tsunami and different coin miners. Notably, the number of ELF files
implementing exploits increased 135% in 2021, including the exploitation of
the Log4j vulnerability CVE-2021-44228.
The 97% increase of PDF files seems to be mainly related to phishing
attacks, often hosted in URLs in-the-wild. On the other hand, we detected
a decrease of 63% in the number of PDF files implementing exploitation
techniques.
Although there is a decrease in the percentage of Android malicious
samples found in 2021, there are two Android samples in the top 10 most
submitted malware of 2021, as well as an Android sample (in this case, a
banker) in the top 10 most searched malware in VirusTotal during the last
quarter of 2021. We detected a moderate increase (12%) in the percentage
of Android malware implementing some kind of exploit.

282%

increase in
the number of
PowerShell files
implementing
exploits

The use of scripting languages for malware distribution is nothing new,
but it seems to keep gaining traction. Malicious PowerShell files are popular
for this purpose, and in addition to an increase in the adoption by attackers
of this format, we observed a whopping 282% increase in the number of
PowerShell files implementing exploits. This can be circumstantial depending
on the ease to exploit some vulnerabilities with this format. In 2021 alone,
we found PowerShell scripts exploiting at least 9 different CVEs.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Most submitted samples in 2021
The list of most submitted malware for the year consists of, not surprisingly,
widespread samples such as Adware and PUAs with half of them sharing
similarity clusters and infrastructure. An extended list also includes generic
trojans and samples both for Windows and Android.
When checking the most looked up samples in VirusTotal during the last
quarter of 2021, we find all kinds of riskware. When excluding them (as well
as coin miners - also for Linux), we get a much more interesting top 10:

Top looked up samples
Ransomware.Blackmatter
Trojan Danabot
Ransom:MSIL/Khonsari.A
Win64/Exploit.CVE-2021-40449.A
Ransom.Win32.Sabsik
Linux/Mirai
Mirai.Linux
Android.Banker, Bankbot
Danabot, Upatre
Linux/Mirai

Not surprisingly, several of the top positions are filled with ransomware.
The exploit for CVE-2021-40449 (Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability in
win32k) does not appear in our list of top exploits for 2021 in terms of
samples abusing it. However, it seems this particular sample was very
widespread among victims.
Danabot is also present in two positions of the top 10, as well as Mirai in this case, this might be a reflection of the increase on ELF malware we
already discussed. Finally, we see Android makes it to this list with a Banker.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Malware Distribution
While we observed no significant difference in the level of phishing
artifacts detected in VirusTotal between 2020 and 2021, other distribution
mechanisms such as the use of exploits or distribution through URLs greatly
varied. In terms of malware droppers, we observed a 37% increase in the
number of samples.

Usage of Exploits
57 0-day exploits were found being used in the wild in 2021 - that’s a new
all time record, and almost twice as much as the year before. These exploits
covered a wide range of software, starting with usual targets such as
popular browsers but also server-side software such as Microsoft Exchange
and devices such as SonicWall Email Security appliances.
During 2021 we observed a 24% jump in the number of samples exploiting
vulnerabilities as compared to 2020. Adding exploit kits to this set of
samples bumped the increase to 30%.
The following chart shows the distribution of samples implementing any
kind of exploit in 2021.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

There are still a huge number of samples weaponized to abuse
vulnerabilities more than 5 years old, which is a gentle reminder as to why
we should keep systems up-to-date. We decided to focus on how quickly
attackers adopted new vulnerabilities. The following chart shows the
timeline for samples first seen in 2021 that exploit vulnerabilities published
in 2020 or 2021.

Fig 4.
Timeline for malware exploiting 2020 and 2021 vulnerabilities.

There are several interesting points to consider. First, peaks occur
when vulnerabilities gain traction for malware distribution. This often
happens shortly after a write-up or a Proof-of-Concept is uploaded to
a public repository. After the peak, attackers decide whether the exploit
becomes part of their toolset and stays, or if it simply is not useful anymore.
We can also see some overlap between exploits where attackers decide
to use them together, either because they need two vulnerabilities for the
exploitation or simply to make samples more likely to infect the victim.
{ 9 }

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

We found an interesting peak in March where CVE-2021-26855 and
CVE-2021-27065, both targeting Microsoft Exchange Server, were part
of an attack chain and distributed together. There is another smaller peak
for CVE-2021-1732 at the time when the researcher uploaded a PoC to
GitHub. We found a peak in September for CVE-2021-40444 (remote
code execution in MSHTML). The peak in November seems to be related
to CVE-2021-41379 (Windows Installer escalation of privileges) and in
December (surprise) we have Log4j CVE-2021-44228.
How are these vulnerabilities being exploited?
CVE-2021-40444 had 3-4 weeks peak, and was mainly implemented
by malicious documents detected as Donoff/Wacatac/Cryxos. Afterwards,
the number of samples slowly decays.
Log4j’s CVE-2021-44228 was one of the most impactful public
vulnerabilities in 2021. The timeline below shows detections all year along,
but this is because there are plenty of false positives detecting Apache
Log4j source code itself as the exploit.

The peak in week 11 (March 2021) corresponds to Tsunami samples used as
payloads by Mirai in Log4j attacks and wrongly detected as exploiting the
vulnerability. Other than that, Mirai and several coin miners seem to have
been heavy adopters of this exploit.

Days from release until exploitation for most exploited
2020/21 vulnerabilities.

We found multiple instances of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the
wild before details were made public, which we think of as negative days
(as relative to 0-days, when the vulnerability is first revealed to the public.)
When averaged with vulnerabilities which we found were exploited after
a public announcement, or positive days, the number of days since a
vulnerability was published until we found samples exploiting it plummeted
between 2020 and 2021. In 2020, it took an average of 93 days for the most
exploited, published vulnerabilities to be used in a cyberattack. In 2021, it
took an average of 0 days for the most exploited, published vulnerabilities
to be used in a cyberattack, because so many of them were being exploited
before their public announcement.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

The selection of vulnerabilities in the previous chart is based on their
popularity in numbers of samples exploiting them found in VirusTotal.
Publication date for vulnerabilities is provided by CVEdetails,it is possible
that some vulnerabilities get officially published after being discovered
in the wild.

Malware distribution in the wild
Compared to 2020, we observed a very slight increase in the number of
malware samples being distributed in the wild (ITW). However, the number
of URLs where ITW malware was found increased by 20%. This means that
malware samples that were distributed using this method were more widely
spread, and the generation of unique URLs for their distribution became
more common. Factors that contributed to this increase include the usage
of legitimate cloud storage and file-sharing services.
The chart below shows the top ten URLs used for malware distribution
during 2021.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Notably, some of them were consistently distributed during the year
while others go up and down depending on how they are used in different
campaigns. If we isolate domains used for malware distribution, it looks
as follows:

Top 10 domains distributing malware in 2021.

Here, the usage of domains look a bit more distributed in different
campaigns for a certain period of time. The biggest campaigns for the first
half of 2021 correspond to malware (mostly PDFs used in phishing attacks)
distributed through legitimate domains such as Amazonaws. However, in the
second half of the year, distribution through both domains is almost nonexistent. Another top 10 domain used for malware distribution is discordapp,
which seems to have been gaining popularity during the last months.
There are several families that used hundreds of ITW URLs for distribution
during 2021, including Mirai, Azorult, and Glupteba. Phishing attacks also
greatly abused this kind of distribution vector.

Malware Trends
Footholding and Lateral movement
There are a number of artifacts potentially used by attackers for lateral
movement, many of which are not necessarily malicious. It is common to
use the same toolset that pentesters and system administrators do. There
are also several malware families from the following section (RATs) that
implement the capabilities needed in the first stages of an attack. Having
said that, in this section we want to provide insights into how several tools
traditionally used by attackers in the first stages of all kinds of attacks
evolved during the year according to our visibility.

CobaltStrike
This is one of the favorite tools used both by pentesters and attackers.
We observed an increase of 155% of fresh samples seen in 2021 for this
artifact, with submissions peaking during the first quarter of the year.

Despite the new samples being first seen during that first Q, the interest

during the year, reflecting how these freshly created samples were later
reused in different attacks.

and attackers, enabling similar functionalities. During 2021, the number of
first seen samples was 23% lower than in the previous year. However, the
number of submissions is incredibly constant during the last two years. We
can observe a peak in the number of lookups in February-March 2021.

Mimikatz
Although there is a 75.5% decrease in the number of fresh samples seen in
2021, in this case the freshness of the sample is probably not as significant
as it could be for other malware families. Despite that, we observe the
biggest historical peaks of submissions for this artifact between August

In addition we looked at some of the most traditional bots. In reality,
this kind of malware should be considered as multi-purpose as it is still an
excellent option for many attacks that leverage the existing victim base and
the basic capabilities as the first stage for more sophisticated attacks. The
evolution for some of the most well-known bots during 2021 is as follows:

Several public sources discussed Dridex campaigns spreading through
Excel documents during 2021.

Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
and Backdoors
RATs are one of the most used malicious tools by attackers for all kinds of
operations, especially in the first stages of an attack – regardless of the
attack’s sophistication. They are part of every attacker’s toolbox, and for the
last few years attackers have chosen widely available RATs over in-house
development except in very specific cases (mostly by APT actors). RATs
allow attackers to perform reconnaissance, deploy other malicious tools as
needed, and avoid attribution. That’s why it is important to keep an eye on
what RATs and backdoors are the most commonly chosen by attackers for
their operations.
The choice of RATs for attacks changed quite a bit during the year according
to the number of samples found in VirusTotal. Here is the ranking of families
that dramatically increased their presence in 2021:

Families

% increase

PADODOR/BERBEW

+2,111%

ASYNCRAT

+139%

FLYAGENT

+118%

ORCUSRAT

+102%

NOANCOOE

+102%

There is a large number of samples (including polymorphic families)
that trigger Padodor/Berbew detections as they share some execution
characteristics, including the use of the same Mutex. Speculatively, this
could be explained by some code reuse, or maybe these families are
designed to trigger this detection on purpose.
We also observed a growth in Crowdsourced Yara rules detecting AsyncRAT,
which is the second fastest growing family. Flyagent made it to the top three
and is one of the most significant families by total number of samples at the
time of writing this report.

{ 19 }

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

In addition, Yara rules detecting DCRat, SystemBC, and Blackshades RAT
malware were among the ones showing most significant growth in 2021.
On the other hand, the following list shows families whose usage decreased
last year – in some cases having almost no new fresh samples in 2021:

Families

% decrease

​​GRAVITYRAT

-99%

SHIZ

-93%

NETWIREDRC

-82%

REMCOSRAT

-82%

XTREMERAT

Despite having a usage decrease, Bladabindi and Darkcomet still are in the
top five by total number of samples first seen by VirusTotal in 2021. The top
five RAT families in absolute numbers first seen in VirusTotal in the last two
years is as follows:

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Crowdsourced data
In this section, we checked samples belonging to different Crowdsourced
Yara rules and VirusTotal Collections in order to understand which ones had
relevant changes during the year.
In terms of fast-growing Yara rules, other than the ones described in the
previous section (DCRat, AsyncRAT, SystemBC and Blackshades RAT), there
are several generic ones based on detecting invalid certificates or packers.
Additionally, we also found several fast-growing Collections tracking
different RATs, such as SystemBC, Sakula RAT or buteRAT. One of the rules
with a bigger growth during the year detects a tool used for large scale
DDoS attacks.
During the first half of the year we also observed remarkable growth
of rules detecting CobaltStrike and BazarLoader. For the second half, the
fastest growing rules detect Quantum Locker, Ryuk, Moonwind and FatDuke.
We also saw Collections for Moonwind and Ryuk growing at a similar rate
for the same period of time.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Final thoughts
Analyzing two years worth of threat intelligence data can be
overwhelming to digest. Our main goal is to apply VirusTotal’s unique
visibility to share useful data points. Below are the main report
takeaways and what they mean:

Attackers are faster in adopting exploits for new vulnerabilities.
This includes the exploitation of 0-days as well as adoption of
published ones.
There is an increase of malware distribution through droppers as
well as an increase in the infrastructure used for malware hosting,
often using legitimate domains.
The total number of samples for Android decreased but, at the
same time, some specific samples were among the most searched
by VirusTotal users. The number of malicious ELF files increased.

VIRUSTOTAL’S 2021 MALWARE TRENDS REPORT

Based on all the above, here are some considerations for including this
insight in an effective security strategy:
Vulnerability patching is critical. Consider using environments
that provide effective and agile patching strategies.
Monitoring the usage and spreading of malware families is crucial
to prioritize effective defenses.
Transformative security events, such as the Log4j vulnerability
(CVE-2021-44228), quickly change the security ecosystem. Effective
monitoring and remediation is critical.
Do not underestimate the presence of well-known malware
families (such as Dridex) in your systems, as they can be first stagers
for serious attacks.
Educate your staff against phishing and social engineering, no
matter the format of the attachment, the domain hosting the file, or
the channel used for distribution.

We hope this data is a first step to an open, healthy
discussion that can help researchers understand how
to better protect against these threats. We trust the
information shared in this report will prove useful and that it will keep our world a little bit safer.
