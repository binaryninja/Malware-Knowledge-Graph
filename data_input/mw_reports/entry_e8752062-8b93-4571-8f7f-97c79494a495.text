New arrival to the targeted ransomware scene appears to be still in
development.
The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, a part of Broadcom Software, has uncovered what
appears to be a new ransomware threat called Yanluowang that is being used in targeted
attacks.
In a recent attempted ransomware attack against a large organization, Symantec obtained a
number of malicious files that, upon further investigation, revealed the threat to be a new, if
somewhat underdeveloped, ransomware family.
The Threat Hunter Team first spotted suspicious use of AdFind, a legitimate command-line
Active Directory query tool, on the victim organization’s network. This tool is often abused by
ransomware attackers as a reconnaissance tool, as well as to equip the attackers with the

resources that they need for lateral movement via Active Directory. Just days after the
suspicious AdFind activity was observed on the victim organization, the attackers attempted
to deploy the Yanluowang ransomware.
Before the ransomware is deployed on a compromised computer, a precursor tool carries out
the following actions:
Creates a .txt file with the number of remote machines to check in the command line
Uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to get a list of processes running
on the remote machines listed in the .txt file
Logs all the processes and remote machine names to processes.txt

The Yanluowang ransomware is then deployed and carries out the following actions:
Stops all hypervisor virtual machines running on the compromised computer
Ends processes listed in processes.txt, which includes SQL and back-up solution
Veeam
Encrypts files on the compromised computer and appends each file with the
.yanluowang extension

The ransom note dropped by Yanluowang warns victims not to contact law enforcement or
ransomware negotiation firms. If the attackers’ rules are broken the ransomware operators
say they will conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the victim, as well
as make “calls to employees and business partners.” The criminals also threaten to repeat
the attack “in a few weeks” and delete the victim’s data.
