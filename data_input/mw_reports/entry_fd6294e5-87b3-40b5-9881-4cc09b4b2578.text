Executive Summary
BlackCat (aka ALPHV) is a ransomware family that surfaced in mid-November 2021 and
quickly gained notoriety for its sophistication and innovation. Operating a ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS) business model, BlackCat was observed soliciting for affiliates in known
cybercrime forums, offering to allow affiliates to leverage the ransomware and keep 80-90%
of the ransom payment. The remainder would be paid to the BlackCat author.

1/14

BlackCat has taken an aggressive approach to naming and shaming victims, listing more
than a dozen on their leak site in a little over a month. The largest number of the group’s
victims so far are U.S. organizations, but BlackCat and its affiliates have also attacked
organizations in Europe, the Philippines and other locations. Victims include organizations in
the following sectors: construction and engineering, retail, transportation, commercial
services, insurance, machinery, professional services, telecommunication, auto components
and pharmaceuticals.
Use of BlackCat ransomware has grown quickly for a variety of reasons (for comparison,
AvosLocker had only listed a handful of victims publicly within two months of becoming
known). Effective marketing to affiliates is a likely factor – in addition to offering an enticing
share of ransom payments, the group has solicited affiliates by posting ads on forums such
as Ransomware Anonymous Market Place (RAMP).
The malware itself is coded in the Rust programming language. Though this is not the first
piece of malware to use Rust, it is one of the first, if not the first, piece of ransomware to use
it. By leveraging this programming language, the malware authors are able to easily compile
it against various operating system architectures. Given its numerous native options, Rust is
highly customizable, which facilitates the ability to pivot and individualize attacks.
The threat actors leveraging BlackCat, often referred to as the "BlackCat gang,” utilize
numerous tactics that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the ransomware space.
Notably, they use multiple extortion techniques in some cases, including the siphoning of
victim data before ransomware deployment, threats to release data if the ransom is not paid
and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
Palo Alto Networks detects and prevents BlackCat ransomware with the following products
and services: Cortex XDR and Next-Generation Firewalls (including cloud-delivered security
subscriptions such as WildFire).
Due to the surge of this malicious activity, we’ve created this threat assessment for overall
awareness. Full visualization of the techniques observed, relevant courses of action and
IOCs can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM viewer.

BlackCat Ransomware Overview
Soliciting via known cybercrime forums, BlackCat is seeking affiliates to deploy its
ransomware. Affiliates keep an 80-90% share of the ransom payment, with the remainder
going to the BlackCat author. These affiliates are interviewed and vetted before being
accepted into the RaaS group. Once the affiliate is confirmed, they are given unique access
to a Tor-based control panel that hosts the affiliate’s access.
Written in the Russian language, the control panel gives the affiliate updates and
announcements about deploying and operating the ransomware as well as troubleshooting
tips to help the affiliate be more successful in their campaigns. Along with the control panel,
a name and shame blog is also hosted, targeting victims who have either ignored or refused
to pay the ransom. This site has been regularly updated with new victims since the initial
discovery of the group.
As shown in Figure 1 below, many RaaS operators use the double-extortion technique of
exfiltrating data prior to encryption, which provides them greater leverage in negotiating
ransom funds. As of December 2021, BlackCat has the seventh largest number of victims
listed on their leak site among ransomware groups tracked by Unit 42 – impressive
considering that this group has only been publicly known since November 2021. While Conti
(ranked second) has been around in various guises for almost two years, it is surrounded at
the top of the chart by emerging families. LockBit 2.0 and Hive both have at least six months’
head start on BlackCat, but this highlights a worrying trend that newcomers (or reformed
groups) can attack many victims in a short space of time.

Using the leak site information, we can understand the location and types of victims affected
by BlackCat attacks. Victims include organizations in the following sectors: construction and
engineering, retail, transportation, commercial services, insurance, machinery, professional
services, telecommunication, auto components and pharmaceuticals. Figure 2 breaks down
the victims by country. However, the so-far sporadic spread of the attacks may indicate a
somewhat opportunistic approach, as with most contemporary ransomware families.

Technical Details
BlackCat is positioned to pivot to individualized, customized attacks due to the numerous
options available when coding in Rust (Figure 3). Rust programming has gained momentum
due to its fast and high performance, powerful web application development, low overhead
for embedded programming, and memory management resolution. Rust also facilitates the
BlackCat author due to its efficiency regarding algorithms that power the encryption
capability of the ransomware. Because of its efficiency and adaptability, BlackCat has been
seen targeting both Windows and Linux systems.

In an effort to maintain longevity, the use of the --access-token flag is required to execute the
ransomware, which can make it harder to analyze in sandboxed environments.

BlackCat Config
While analyzing the ransomware configurations, we observed numerous evasion tactics
deployed. These evasion techniques are used in an effort to impair or disable system
defenses as well as to stop certain applications that may lock files open on disk, causing
problems when trying to encrypt them. BlackCat attempts to kill several processes and
services to hinder or prevent security solutions and backups. The process list checked is as
follows:
agntsvc, dbeng50, dbsnmp, encsvc, excel, firefox, infopath, isqlplussvc, msaccess, mspub,
mydesktopqos, mydesktopservice, notepad, ocautoupds, ocomm, ocssd, onenote, oracle,
outlook, powerpnt, sqbcoreservice, sql, steam, synctime, tbirdconfig, thebat, thunderbird,

saphostexec, saposcol, sapstartsrv, avagent, avscc, DellSystemDetect, EnterpriseClient,
VeeamNFSSvc, VeeamTransportSvc, VeeamDeploymentSvc
The services running on the compromised system are checked against the following list:
mepocs, memtas, veeam, svc$, backup, sql, vss, msexchange, sql$, mysql, mysql$, sophos,
MSExchange, MSExchange$, WSBExchange, PDVFSService, BackupExecVSSProvider,

In an effort to maintain persistence, the BlackCat ransomware excludes key system and
application folders – as well as key components – from encryption so as not to render the
system and ransomware inoperative. The folders excluded are as follows:
system volume information, intel, $windows.~ws, application data, $recycle.bin, mozilla,
$windows.~bt, public, msocache, windows, default, all users, tor browser, programdata, boot,
config.msi, google, perflogs, appdata, windows.old
Excluded file names are as follows:
desktop.ini, autorun.inf, ntldr, bootsect.bak, thumbs.db, boot.ini, ntuser.dat, iconcache.db,
bootfont.bin, ntuser.ini, ntuser.dat.log
Any file with an extension matching the following list will also be avoided:
themepack, nls, diagpkg, msi, lnk, exe, cab, scr, bat, drv, rtp, msp, prf, msc, ico, key, ocx,
diagcab, diagcfg, pdb, wpx, hlp, icns, rom, dll, msstyles, mod, ps1, ics, hta, bin, cmd, ani,
386, lock, cur, idx, sys, com, deskthemepack, shs, ldf, theme, mpa, nomedia, spl, cpl, adv,
icl, msu
Hardcoded credentials stored within the BlackCat ransomware config lend credence to the
likelihood that specific victims are being targeted. The credentials also allow BlackCat to
move laterally within the victim’s system and/or network, often with administrative privileges.
Credential access permits the ransomware to deploy additional tools that further propagate
the attack. These observations have also been confirmed by Symantec.

Associated Tools
BlackCat has been observed using multiple – often legitimate – tools throughout their
attacks, such as Mimikatz, LaZagne and WebBrowserPassView to recover stored
passwords, as well as GO Simple Tunnel (GOST) and MEGAsync to exfiltrate data.
Additionally, anti-forensics tools like fileshredder, an application to securely delete unwanted
files beyond recovery, have also been leveraged during some BlackCat ransomware attacks
investigated by Unit 42.

Post-compromise Activities

7/14

Once candidate systems have been identified for encryption by the threat actors, the
ransomware deployment occurs and all viable files will be encrypted. This process often
involves renaming files to include another or a different file extension, such as wpzlbji, in the
example shown in Figure 4. As is commonplace with other ransomware strains, BlackCat
ransomware will drop ransom notes on the compromised system(s) to inform the victim of
what has happened and how to go about getting their data restored. Text files with the name
RECOVER-[RANDOM]-FILES.txt (where [RANDOM] refers to the aforementioned file
extension name) will be found on the compromised system containing information and
instructions such as those in the example below:

Figure 4. An example of a BlackCat ransom note dropped on a compromised system.
BlackCat utilizes a unique onion domain with a victim-specific access key for the victim to
use to learn more about the attack, their data, and what the threat actors want the victim to
do next. The following example URL highlights the notation used by BlackCat ransomware:
http://2cuqgeerjdba2rhdiviezodpu3lc4qz2sjf4qin6f7std2evleqlzjid[.]onion/?accesskey=${ACCESS_KEY}","note_short_text":"Important
Once the victim navigates to the onion site provided, they will see something similar to
Figure 5 below. This site reiterates the problem and that the actor's Decrypt App private key
is the only way to get their data back. The portal also provides chat facilities, the ransom
8/14

amounts – which can differ depending on when the payment is sent – how to pay, and a way
to test that the decryption works.

Figure 5. Example onion site information for BlackCat victims.
Unit 42 has observed BlackCat affiliates asking for ransom amounts of up to $14 million,
though they offered to discount this demand to $9 million if paid before the established time.
Interestingly, the ransom demand gives the victim the option to pay not only in Bitcoin (the
most common option) but also in Monero.
In some cases, BlackCat operators use the chat to threaten the victim, claiming they will
perform a DDoS attack on the victims' infrastructure if the ransom is not paid. When it
appears in addition to the use of a leak site, this practice is known as triple extortion, a tactic
that was observed being used by groups like Avaddon and Suncrypt in the past.

9/14

One unique feature of BlackCat ransomware is that negotiation chats can only be accessed
by those holding an access token key or ransom note – the group has made efforts to avoid
third-party snooping.

Conclusion
BlackCat is an innovative and sophisticated ransomware family that is rapidly forming a
reputation for its highly customized and individualized attacks. By leveraging the Rust
programming language, the malware authors are able to easily compile it against various
operating system architectures, which facilitates the group’s ability to pivot from one victim to
the next. As seen with other ransomware families, BlackCat operates with a RaaS model and
utilizes multiple extortion techniques, then publishes a leak site to further pressure victims
into paying the ransom.
Palo Alto Networks detects and prevents BlackCat ransomware in the following ways:
WildFire: All known samples are identified as malware.
Cortex XDR with:
Indicators for BlackCat.
Anti-Ransomware Module to detect BlackCat encryption behaviors on Windows.
