Updated as of September 10, 2018, 6:40 PM PDT to update how PyLocky establishes C&C
connection.
While ransomware has noticeably plateaued in today’s threat landscape, it’s still a
cybercriminal staple. In fact, it saw a slight increase in activity in the first half of 2018,
keeping pace by being fine-tuned to evade security solutions, or in the case of PyLocky
(detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_PYLOCKY.A), imitate established ransomware
families and ride on their notoriety.
In late July and throughout August, we observed waves of spam email delivering the
PyLocky ransomware. Although it tries to pass off as Locky in its ransom note, PyLocky is
unrelated to Locky. PyLocky is written in Python, a popular scripting language; and packaged
with PyInstaller, a tool used to package Python-based programs as standalone executables.
Ransomware written in Python isn’t new — we’ve already seen CryPy (RANSOM_CRYPY.A)
in 2016, and Pyl33t (RANSOM_CRYPPYT.A) in 2017 — but PyLocky features anti-machine
learning capability, which makes it notable. Through the combined use of Inno Setup Installer
(an open-source script-based installer) and PyInstaller, it posed a challenge to static analysis
methods, including machine learning-based solutions — something we have already seen
variants of Cerber do (although Cerber used NullSoft installer).

PyLocky’s distribution also appears to be concentrated; we saw several spam emails
targeting European countries, particularly France. And though the spam run started out
small, its volume and scope eventually increased.

Infection Chain
On August 2, we detected a spam run distributing PyLocky to French businesses, luring
them with socially engineered subject lines such as those related to invoices. The email
entices the user to click a link, which redirects users to a malicious URL containing PyLocky.
Figure 3: Spam email with the subject line, “Nous avons reçu votre paiement," which
means “We have received your payment”.
The malicious URL leads to a ZIP file (Facture_23100.31.07.2018.zip) that contains a signed
executable (Facture_23100.31.07.2018.exe). When successfully run, the
Facture_23100.31.07.2018.exe will drop malware components — several C++ and Python
libraries and the Python 2.7 Core dynamic-link library (DLL) — along with the main
ransomware executable (lockyfud.exe, which was created via PyInstaller ) in C:\Users\
{user}\AppData\Local\Temp\is-{random}.tmp.

PyLocky encypts image, video, document, sound, program, game, database, and archive
files, among others. Here’s a list of file types PyLocky encrypts:
.dat, .keychain, .sdf, .vcf, .jpg, .png, .tiff, .gif, .jpeg, .jif, .jp2, .jpx, .j2k, .j2c, .fpx, .pcd, .bmp,

Encryption routine
PyLocky is configured to encrypt a hardcoded list of file extensions. PyLocky also abuses
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to check the properties of the affected system.
For its anti-sandbox capability, PyLocky will sleep for 999,999 seconds — or just over 11.5
days — if the affected system’s total visible memory size is less than 4GB. The file
encryption routine executes if it is greater than or equal to 4GB.
After encryption, PyLocky will establish communication with its command-and-control (C&C)
server. PyLocky implements its encryption routines using PyCrypto library – using the 3DES
(Triple DES) cipher. PyLocky iterates through each logical drive, first generating a list of files
before calling the ‘efile’ method, which overwrites each file with an encrypted version, then
drops the ransom note.
PyLocky’s ransom notes are in English, French, Korean, and Italian, which may suggest that
it may also target Korean- and Italian-speaking users. It also sends the affected system’s
information to the C&C server via POST.

Mitigation and Trend Micro Solutions
PyLocky’s evasion techniques and abuse of legitimate tools typically reserved to
administrators further exemplify the significance of defense in depth. For instance, machine
learning is a valuable cybersecurity tool in detecting unique malware, but it is not a silver
bullet. With today’s threats, there are different vectors at the attackers’ disposal, which
makes a multi-layered approach to security important. Apply best practices: regularly back
up files, keep the system updated, secure the use of system components, and foster a
culture of cybersecurity awareness.
Trend Micro XGen™ security provides a cross-generational blend of threat defense
techniques against a full range of threats for data centers, cloud environments, networks,
and endpoints. It features high-fidelity machine learning to secure
the gateway and endpoint data and applications, and protects physical, virtual, and cloud
workloads. With capabilities like web/URL filtering, behavioral analysis, and custom
sandboxing, XGen™ protects against today’s purpose-built threats that bypass traditional

3/4

controls, exploit known, unknown, or undisclosed vulnerabilities, and either steal or encrypt
personally-identifiable data. Smart, optimized, and connected, XGen™ powers Trend Micro’s
suite of security solutions: Hybrid Cloud Security, User Protection, and Network Defense.
