Summary:
So I know what your thinking – “where are my EK posts”. Well truth is I’m still looking at EK’s
but a lot of my sources have dried up and I don’t have the tech and tools to be able to search
wide and far for them. I took a break and now I’ve decided to just post things that interest me
and hopefully they will interest you as well. I’m not a reverse engineer so the tech details
here are light.
Now onto the main event. I tweeted about a malware called Snatch Loader: Reloaded mid
November. This is a not a new malware but Arbor Networks recently revealed multiple
changes within it. I actually received a phishing email in my inbox which I deleted as you do
but I kept the URL and decided to Tweet on it after some help from @James_inthe_box.
I’ve been tracking it since and now I’ve decided to quickly blog on it. I found some interesting
files on the C2 domain and saw some notable changes in the processes.
Not from EK and no blog, just something different and playing with #procdot

1/6

Analysis:
Snatch Loader would have arrived via a phishing email. I do not have one to show you at
hand but they all contain (so far) a fake “Trusted sender” message like below. The emails
themselves are rather convincing and contain addresses, etc.

This email would contain a link that downloads a ZIP file that contains an LNK (shortcut) that
actually runs a script in CMD. When ran this leads to a series of events such as in the image
below but bear in mind that is from a sample in early November.

I have found a sample on Virus Total which was last submitted on the 09-Dec-2017. So I ran
it. Below you can see that it differs somewhat to the sample above. I did not have any
iexplore or control.exe running.

I noticed that iexplore.exe was making the C2 calls

The calls were over HTTPS and I do not currently have a setup that can let me debug it to
use HTTP or some way to man in the middle it. You can see the domain though in the DNS
requests.

Now I waited some time but it did not seem to load any other malware at least not to my
knowledge. It has been known to drop Ramnit though and contain a crypto mining (XMR)
module.
Instead I decided to peek around and found some interesting stuff on the C2 domain.
First I found some encrypted data at the C2 which I guessed the rest of the URL based on
past C2’s for Snatch Loader.

3/6

I did not seek to decrypt this but it looks like it has multiple layers to it.
After some digging around I found an “admin” panel.

Finally and most interestingly I found what appears to be data files. Note the date on some of
them.

4/6

Clicking on one shows they can probably be streamed and turned into an executable.

I don’t know what these are but they likely files that can be loaded by Snatch Loader. I’m not
sure what conditions are required for this. Though I presume if connected to the Snatch
Loader botnet, the operators can then manually load files.

5/6

That’s all for now. It’s clear the malware is still being updated and configured. As it is sent via
phishing emails that contain a URL, it is likely to bypass systems that can’t sandbox URL’s.
Watch out for emails that contain a fake “Trusted Sender” message.
