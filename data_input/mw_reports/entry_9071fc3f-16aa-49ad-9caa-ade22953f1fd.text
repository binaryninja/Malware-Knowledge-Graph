One-Click Microsoft Exchange On-Premises Mitigation
Tool â€“ March 2021
msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/15/one-click-microsoft-exchange-on-premises-mitigation-tool-march-2021/

We have been actively working with customers through our customer support teams, thirdparty hosters, and partner network to help them secure their environments and respond to
associated threats from the recent Exchange Server on-premises attacks. Based on these
engagements we realized that there was a need for a simple, easy to use, automated
solution that would meet the needs of customers using both current and out-of-support
versions of on-premises Exchange Server.
Microsoft has released a new, one-click mitigation tool, Microsoft Exchange On-Premises
Mitigation Tool to help customers who do not have dedicated security or IT teams to apply
these security updates. We have tested this tool across Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and
2019 deployments. This new tool is designed as an interim mitigation for customers who are
unfamiliar with the patch/update process or who have not yet applied the on-premises
Exchange security update.
By downloading and running this tool, which includes the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner,
customers will automatically mitigate CVE-2021-26855 on any Exchange server on which it
is deployed. This tool is not a replacement for the Exchange security update but is the fastest
and easiest way to mitigate the highest risks to internet-connected, on-premises Exchange
Servers prior to patching.
We recommend that all customers who have not yet applied the on-premises Exchange
security update:
Download this tool.
Run it on your Exchange servers immediately.
Then, follow the more detailed guidance here to ensure that your on-premises
Exchange is protected.
If you are already using Microsoft Safety Scanner, it is still live and we recommend
keeping this running as it can be used to help with additional mitigations.

Once run, the Run EOMT.ps1 tool will perform three operations:
Mitigate against current known attacks using CVE-2021-26855 using a URL Rewrite
configuration.
Scan the Exchange Server using the Microsoft Safety Scanner.
Attempt to reverse any changes made by identified threats.
Before running the tool, you should understand:
The Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool is effective against the attacks we have
seen so far, but is not guaranteed to mitigate all possible future attack techniques. This
tool should only be used as a temporary mitigation until your Exchange servers
can be fully updated as outlined in our previous guidance.
We recommend this script over the previous ExchangeMitigations.ps1 script as it
tuned based on the latest threat intelligence. If you have already started with the
other script, it is fine to switch to this one.
This is a recommended approach for Exchange deployments with Internet access and
for those who want to attempt automated remediation.
Thus far, we have not observed any impact to Exchange Server functionality when
these mitigation methods are deployed.
For more technical information, examples, and guidance please review the GitHub
documentation.
