Cellular Network Security Complications
As is shown in the SS7 network
analysis performed by Positive
Technologies in 2014*, even hackers
with a minimal knowledge of how
to launch security attacks against a
telecom company can:
­­ Disclose a subscriber location
­­ Wiretap phone calls
­­ Intercept SMS messages and

passwords
­­ Steal money from subscriber

accounts
­­ Affect availability of service

The research also discovered that:
­­ Even the top 10 telecom

operators are vulnerable to these
attacks

Our society is more reliant than ever on telecommunications. There are at least 4bn subscribers worldwide and 70% of firms rely on the SS7 network for Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) solutions for the provision of their own services. Everything from ATMs
to GPS navigation devices already transmits data over cellular networks.
But there is a significant weakness at the heart of this mobile revolution: the widely-used SS7
signaling protocols were developed decades ago with no protection provided or even planned.
Though recently introduced, SIGTRAN specifications for SS7 protocols inherited all the weak
points of SS7.
Mobile communications further evolved to provide mobile carriers and service providers with
wider access to SS7 networks. Overall roaming connectivity adds to the pressure on mobile
carriers to ensure network security and continuity of service. This lack of security enables hackers
to send, intercept, and alter SS7 messages attacking cellular networks and subscribers.
Recently, SS7 security has become very topical:
­­

When Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the CIA, first talked about the total surveillance by the NSA, many infosec experts showed evidence that the main technique the NSA
could have used was exploitation of SS7 vulnerabilities.

­­

There are private companies offering SS7 attack services at reasonable rates, and as more companies enter the market, the rates continue to fall.

­­

Celebrities’ private conversations posted on the Internet by hackers have become more frequent.

­­

Current SS7 filtering systems (firewalls) are weak as they fail to analyze signaling traffic flows in
detail without causing a loss of speed and connectivity.

­­ Hacker location and network

type are of no significance
­­ Hackers only need a Linux-based

PC
­­ Required software is available on

the Internet
­­ Attacks involve valid SS7

messages: rough filtration can
negatively affect your entire
service

PT SS7 Attack Discovery™: Detecting Mobile Attacks
PT SS7 Attack Discovery™ — a new telecom security solution from Positive Technologies — detects
intrusions via an SS7 network online and immediately informs infosec departments for early incident response. The system also performs a retrospective analysis of signaling traffic and assists in
forensics tasks while not interfering with SS7/SIGTRAN interaction. Key features:
­­

­­

Detection of all SS7 attack vectors including: examination of the network and collection
of subscriber data (IMSI, MSC/VLR, HLR), user location tracking, interception of SMS messages,
sending of spoofed SMS and USSD messages, subscriber or cellular segment DoS, billing bypass, alteration of subscriber profiles in VLR and subscriber categories.
Low impact on signaling traffic. The PT SS7 AD™ system is implemented at the border of
the SS7 network avoiding a negative effect on signaling traffic. Only an IP connection is required. There is no need to assign special addresses to SS7 in the form of Signaling Point Codes
(SPC) or Global Titles (GT). Quick attack identification and its thorough analysis enhances protection avoiding impact on the speed of the network and its services.

­­

Message correlation. This is available in systems with load balancing over several Signal
Transfer Points (STPs), ensuring the whole SS7 perimeter is covered and preventing false positives.

­­

Regularly updated knowledge base. PT SS7 AD™ benefits from the expertise of the specialist Positive Technologies Telecoms Research Lab, ensuring it reflects the very latest research
on SS7 security.

­­

Dynamic analysis. This approach rapidly determines which SS7 network activity is irregular
by monitoring traffic changes and comparing its characteristics at different times.

­­

Data visualization. User-friendly dashboards display information about all interactions with
external SS7 networks; attacks and fraud attempts. These dashboards are configurable for ease
of data analysis.

Additional Features
PT SS7 Attack Discovery™ is used to
create a single SS7 stream database
in a carrier’s network. In addition to
detecting attacks, its in-depth analysis of signaling traffic and call flows
enables carriers to:
­­ Investigate fraud
­­ Gather evidence of malicious

activity
­­ Detect equipment errors
­­ Find bottlenecks in the carrier’s

infrastructure

Attack Vectors: How to Detect and Prevent
Example №1: Network investigation and collection of subscriber data (IMSI, MSC/VLR,
HLR). A hacker examines an operator’s network (1), finds core hosts, determines their functional
roles (2, 3), and collects information that the network discloses (4).

Meanwhile, PT SS7 AD™ logs his actions identifying illegal use of such messages as SRI4SM, SRI,
SRI4LCS, SendIMSI, etc. Recognizing attacks while they are being planned helps to prevent their
execution.
Example №2: Disclosure of subscriber location and control over his moves. With necessary data on the network and its subscribers gathered, the hacker directly addresses the main
hosts (1, 2) requesting information about the subscriber via ATI, PSI, and SRI messages (3).

Using signature analysis, PT SS7 Attack Discovery™ singles out illegal messages from the traffic and
registers an attack attempt. Rapid response to the attack can block and prevent the hacker from
monitoring subscriber moves.
Example №3: Interception of SMS messages is one of the most perilous attacks because it
exploits SMS messages that often include sensitive information such as payment confirmation (3D
Secure codes) and recovery data for email, social network, and payment service passwords. The
attacker only needs to register a victim subscriber on a fake MSC/VLR (1, 2). If successful, the hacker
will receive all subscriber’s SMS messages (3–6).

Analyzing subscriber registration outside the home network, PT SS7 AD™ checks its integrity and
detects suspicious and unfinished procedures that prove attack attempts. With this attack detected,
you can be sure there was an attempt to compromise a subscriber and obtain his data. Therefore,
prevention of such attacks and notification of clients of such attempts is a necessity.
Example №4: DoS for MSC. A hacker can directly attack an operator’s network and its services.
The most severe are DoS attacks because they cause network unavailability and many other negative implications. The attack is based on the procedure of assigning a roaming number (MSRN)
when receiving a voice call. If an attacker sends multiple roaming number requests (1), then the
pool of available numbers will soon be exhausted (2). As a result, the switch will not be able to
process terminating calls (3).

Studying valid call flow sequences, PT SS7 AD™ detects attacks at the very beginning, identifies and
helps to block attack sources. Detection of other DoS attacks — exploitation of HLR Reset and SCCP
Management, denial of service via SSN Prohibit and TID Flood — has the same algorithm.
PT SS7 Attack Discovery™ can also discover redirection and wiretapping of voice calls, sending of
fake SMS and USSD messages, subscriber DoS, spoofing of a subscriber’s profile in a VLR, alteration of a subscriber’s category, and many other attacks. For details, see the SIGNALING SYSTEM

PT SS7 Attack Discovery™ in Use
Application

Modularity
PT SS7 Attack Discovery™ includes two types of modules. SS7 Sensor collects raw SS7 traffic from
the STP, singles out useful data, and sends messages to Attack Detector. Attack Detector aggregates processed SS7 traffic from all SS7 Sensors in the network, creates dialogs, discovers intrusions
using its knowledge base, and examines signaling traffic for unusual behavior.

SCCP
MTP

Full view

Sensor

PT SS7 Attack Discovery™ obtains data from all required links, either international or local, and places
it in separate dialogs on Attack Detector to avoid loss of system messages and false positives.
In-depth protocol analysis

SS7 traffic processing

PT SS7 AD™ studies all-layer protocols and checks address information, address and subscriber ID
compliance, and operation codes. Based on the complete view of the signal exchange, the system
comes to a conclusion about the attack and immediately informs the infosec department about it.

Signaling messages

Call flow inspection

Attack Detector

With a vast knowledge of mobile systems, PT SS7 AD™ identifies suspicious messages from external
networks, unusual message sequences, and wrong equipment responses to outside actions. The
system renders all data on anomalies to information security staff for analysis.
Flexible classification of attacks
With a custom event classification system, PT SS7 AD™ signals an attack if a message comes from a
blacklisted address. There is also the option to create white lists — a limited number of addresses
whose actions will be recognized as valid.

Deployment and Operation Modes
