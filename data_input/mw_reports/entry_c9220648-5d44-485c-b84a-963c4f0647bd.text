Attacks against Israeli & Palestinian interests

Executive Summary
This short report details the techniques being used in a series of attacks mostly against Israel­based
organisations. The decoy documents and filenames used in the attacks suggest the intended targets
include organisations with political interests or influence in Israel and Palestine. Although we are unable
to link this campaign to any already documented in open source, it bears similarities to some described
by others previously[1],[2].
The earliest samples in the campaign we have identified date back to the summer of 2014. The number
of samples discovered and relatively small scale of infrastructure suggest the attackers have limited
resources with which to conduct attacks.
Introduction
Our investigation begins by taking a look at the following file:
ecc240f1983007177bc5bbecba50eea27b80fd3d14fd261bef6cda10b8ffe1e9. According to the analysis
published on malwr.com[3], this file was originally named ‘Israel Homeland Defense Directory 2015
_Secured_.exe’ and, once executed, the following decoy document was presented:

The initial file in this case is a self­extracting RAR file that contains three components, including a decoy
document (in this case, the PDF shown above) and the malware.
Further inspection of the malware extracted showed it wasn’t a family our analysts recognised. This,
coupled with the nature of the decoy document used, led us to take a more in depth look at the malware,
and associated infrastructure.
We’d like to give special thanks to Eyal Sela of ClearSky Security for his collaborative efforts in this
research.
Delivery
The most common way this malware packaged is via a self­extracting RAR file; however the attackers
also appear to have used a number of other solutions to drop their malware, including a Visual Basic
based wrapper and an Auto­IT based wrapper.
In terms of how the malware is delivered, it’s most likely that it’s done via spearphishing. For example,
there are also several occasions where the VirusTotal ‘ITW’ tab suggests that the original dropper was
available to download on a 3rd party website. In the case of the sample discussed in the introduction we
can see:

Pomf.se is a relatively low­profile file sharing/hosting website currently based in Sweden. The use of

Pomf.se is a relatively low­profile file sharing/hosting website currently based in Sweden. The use of
low­key file­sharing sites appears to be a feature of the campaign as far as we can tell, with a few other
similar sites being used in the same way.
This, in conjunction with the nature of the related files we have discovered (all of them are directly
executable files) means it is likely that the malware is primarily delivered via spear phishing attempts,
rather than any other method.
DownExecute – Brief Analysis
In this analysis, we’ll go over the file with a SHA256 hash of
ecc240f1983007177bc5bbecba50eea27b80fd3d14fd261bef6cda10b8ffe1e9.
We’ve chosen to refer to the malware as ‘DownExecute’ due to the .pdb string left in the malware
(leaving debug paths in malware seems to be very fashionable at the moment…):

All variants of the DownExecute’ malware we’ve identified come packaged in the following fashion:

From the samples we have analysed so far, the decoy application included is never used by the binary,
and is presumably included so that anyone taking a cursory look at the file will conclude it is in fact the
real deal. Whilst the cURL[4] binary included is used for internet connectivity but it’s currently unclear
why the attackers chose to use this method of adding connectivity to their file.
Some of the binaries are also self­signed:

So what can this malware do? Not all that much – it’s just a downloader.
Before execution, the malware makes a couple of checks to avoid analysis, including checking for the
presence of a debugger using IsDebuggerPresent as well as checking for the presence of VirtualBox by
looking for the device name \\.\VBoxMiniRdrDN:

The malware also checks for the presence of several anti­virus solutions, as well for any processes
including the word ‘security’:

The malware then proceeds to decrypt some basic configuration data, including the command & control
domain, and information about the origin of the infection, tracked via ID:

Meanwhile, the malware begins calling home, whilst also keeping a log of its actions in a plaintext file
that is created in the same folder as where the binary was executed from.

After successful compromise…
It appears as though the clue for the main functionality of this malware is in its name (it downloads, and
then executes) files, as it offers little else for the attacker. The DownExecute malware is used as a way
for the attackers to gain an initial foothold on the victim machine. The basic information reported back by
the malware would also certainly allow the attacker a way to triage infections to ensure they had
reached their intended victim rather than a researcher.
We don’t have great visibility into post­compromise activity at this stage; however there are a number of
other malware samples which communicate with the same infrastructure as the DownExecute samples.
It’s not unreasonable to infer that if these are more fully featured backdoors, that they are likely the 2nd
stage malware families used in conjunction with DownExecute. Specifically, we’ve observed the well­
documented Xtreme RAT and Poison Ivy malware families in use with the same domain names as
DownExecute. The Poison Ivy passwords observed for the group were ‘admin2014’ and ‘admin!@#$%”.
Command & Control Infrastructure

The vast majority of infrastructure in terms of hostnames observed associated with these attacks have
been dynamic DNS domains, primarily associated with no­ip.com. This provider is popular with several
Middle Eastern threat actors tracked by PwC’s intelligence team. In terms of the size of the infrastructure
used in the campaign using the tools described, it’s also fairly small, as shown on our Maltego graph.
The attackers have made an unusual choice with respect to the hosting providers used for the malicious
infrastructure. Most of the domains at the time of writing, and indeed historically, have pointed to IP
address space owned by Host Sailor, geo­located in Belize. Many of the threat actors in the Middle East
that we’re familiar with have extremely volatile IP hosting, owing to the fact that the infrastructure is likely
to be hosted on their own networks. This remote hosting therefore somewhat bucks the trend of some of

to be hosted on their own networks. This remote hosting therefore somewhat bucks the trend of some of
the other actors we see from the region.
Inferred Targeting
As we have mentioned in a number of our other reports[5], attackers often use C&C domains which
contain phrases relevant to their targets so as to make them appear legitimate. With this in mind we
performed some simple analysis on the domain names used in this campaign to identify legitimate
organisations being impersonated. For a full list of C&Cs used, please see Appendix B.

As shown, there appears to be a theme here, with a number of Israeli news organisations being used as
C&C themes and hence probably being targeted. So do we believe this campaign is focused only at
Israeli companies? Perhaps not entirely.
Targeting
Whilst there are a number of documents clearly aimed at Israeli nationals , using political and military
themes, one of the lures[6] included an Arabic language decoy document pictured below:

The document in question discusses an alleged leak of information relating to Abbas, leader of the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Whilst this is a subject which is clearly of key interest to all parties in
the region, the fact the attackers sent an Arabic language version of the story may indicate that the
recipient was expected to be fluent in Arabic, and possibly therefore less likely to be Israeli, but rather

someone from another adjacent region.
Conclusion
Whilst, in this case, we’re unable to attribute this set of activity to a specific group or entity in the Middle
East, it does bear a significant resemblance to many attacks seen from the Middle East that have been
previously documented. Specifically, the following aspects of this campaign remind us of existing write­
ups on Middle Eastern campaigns:
Consistent use of the dynamic DNS provider no­ip.com and associated domains: it’s unclear
why there is a preference for this, however in several ‘how­to’ videos on Arabic language
underground forums the video creators recommend using no­ip.com as opposed to other dynamic
DNS providers;
Use of publically available malware: many groups operating in the Middle East use malware
families (such as Poison Ivy/Xtreme RAT) which are publically available rather than developing their
own binaries;
Variety of targeting: the targeting seems entirely restricted to Middle Eastern issues and, whilst
there appears to be a heavy focus on Israel in the decoy documents we’ve observed, there is the
possibility that Palestinians have been targeted as well. This is consistent with the complex
relationships between the different nations and political groups in the region;
[7]

Password schema: In their August 2013 blog , FireEye noted that a group they refer to as
MoleRats used Poison Ivy and Xtreme RAT, in conjunction with a password of “!@#GooD#@!” The
keyboard walk used for the symbols “!@#” across the top of a keyboard is similar to the password
observed in some of our Poison Ivy samples.
The fact that the attackers chose to develop their own dropper may be indicative that their biggest
problem when conducting network intrusions is getting their foot in the door – particularly as it seems as
though they still prefer the more fully featured Poison Ivy and Xtreme RAT backdoors as 2nd stage
malware families.
When we pivoted and looked for the earliest examples of the DownExecute malware, the first samples
we could find were compiled in June 2014. We have no reason to believe in this case that the threat
actor has tampered with the compile time on any samples, as all other samples discovered were
identified shortly after they were compiled. As such we believe the campaign using this downloader
malware has been on­going for approximately 12 months.
