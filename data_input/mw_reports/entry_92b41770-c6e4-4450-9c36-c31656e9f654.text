Threat Profile: Evil Corp (AKA UNC2165)
Executive Summary

Evil Corp (AKA UNC2165) is a one of the most capable cybercriminal syndicates in the world. They are
based out of Russia and have been operational since 2009. They are responsible for the development and
operations of several of the most powerful malware and ransomware variants, and maintain strong
relationships not just with other powerful cybercriminal gangs, but also the Russian government. The U.S.
federal government has indicted members of their gang and has an active bounty offered for information
on their leadership. Evil Corp has been observed modifying their activities to circumvent U.S. federal
government actions to stop them.

Impact to HPH Sector

Evil Corp should be considered a significant threat to the U.S. health sector based on several factors.
Ransomware is one of their primary modus operandis as they have developed and maintained many
strains. Many ransomware operators have found the health sector to be an enticing target as, due to the
nature of their operations, they are likely to pay some form of ransom to restor operations. Healthcare
organizations are particularly suceptible to data theft as personal health information (PHI) is often sold on
the dark web to those looking to leverage it for fraudulent purposes. Foreign governments often find it to
be more cost effective to steal research and intelliectual property via data exfiltration cyberattacks rather
than invest time and money into conducting research themselves. This includes intellectual property
related to the health sector. It is entirely plausable that Evil Corp could be tasked with acquiring
intellectual property from the U.S. health sector using such means at the behest of the Russian
government.

Overview

Evil Corp is a cybercriminal gang that has been exceptionally aggressive and capable in their more than
decade of global hacking operations. According to the U.S. Treasury Department in 2019, “Evil Corp has
used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and
financial institutions in over 40 countries, causing more than $100 million in theft,” and also has, “caused
millions of dollars of damage to U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers.”
Seventeen members of the group have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department and two key
members are under indictment by the FBI. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refered to Evil Corp
as, “of the world’s most prolific cybercriminal organizations.” Former Assistant Attorney General Brian A.
Benczkowski characterized some of Evil Corp's actions as having, “deployed two of the most damaging
pieces of financial malware ever used and resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses to victims
worldwide" and being, “the perpetrators behind the world’s most egregious cyberattacks,” and having
targeted victims across the globe in, “one of the most widespread malware campaigns we have ever
encountered.” The State Department and FBI have a standing offer of $5 million for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of their leader, Maksim Yakubets, which is the largest reward for a cybercriminal
ever offered.
Evil Corp is known for their development and operation of Dridex (related to Cridex and Bugat), which is a
multifunctional malware variant capable of impacting the confidentiality and availability of protected data
and systems directly related to business operations. This has included banking and healthcare
information. The Department of Homeland Security has called Dridex, “one of the most prevalent financial

Trojans.” They are also known for developing and operating Zeus and several of its major variants, as well
as a number of prevalent ransomware variants such as Doppelpaymer, Hades, Phoenixlocker and
Wastedlocker.

Nomenclature and Associations/Affiliations

Evil Corp is also known as UNC2165, GOLD DRAKE and Indrik Spider. Please note that these associated
threat group labels are presented as coassociated with a high degree of confidence, but are not 100%
absolute as they represent intrusion clusters analyzed by a number of different research teams and
organizations. It is also worth noting that there are open source assessments which associate Evil Corp
with TA-505, however HC3 does not currently support that conclusion.

Leadership and Key Individuals
•

•

•
•
•

•

Maksim Yakubets is Evil Corp’s leader and is responsible for managing and supervising the group’s
operations as well as intefacing with the Russian government. He is known to have worked directly
with Andrey Ghinkul in the operations of their Dridex malware program. Yakubets has also been
responsible for recruiting and managing Evil Corp’s money mules – individuals responsible for
facilitating the movement of money illicitly gained through a series of accounts which make tracing
these transactions a significant challenge to law enforcement. Yakubets was indicted by a federal
grand jury in 2019 and charged with conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud, and bank fraud.
This was related to the distribution of Bugat, a predecessor of Dridex. He was also charged in a
separate criminal complaint that year with conspiracy to participate in racketeering, computer fraud
and theft. Yakubets is also known for his relationship with the Russian government. Yakubets has
also provided direct assistance to one of Russia's leading intelligence organizations, the FSB, who
were sanctioned in December of 2016. Yakubets was known to be in the process of obtaining the
equivalent of a security clearance to formally obtain permission to access classified information in
support of the Russian FSB. Yakubets has been tasked to work on projects for the Russian
government, which included the acquisition of protected data through agressive actions in
cyberspace and conducting cyber operations on its behalf.
Evgeniy Bogachev is a key member of Evil Corp who is currently wanted by the FBI for his
management of several of the prolific Zeus malware variants (including Jabber Zeus and GameOver
Zeus), used to target many sectors including healthcare in order to collect and further exploit
sensitive data. He is the second significant member of Evil Corp to have been indicted in 2019,
along with Yakubets. Bogachev is known to go by the online monikers “lucky12345” and “slavik”.
Similar to yakubets, Bogachev is considered one of the most wanted hackers in the world.
Igor Turashev is another key memebr who is known to have served Evil Corp as an administrator,
has had a role in targeting and has also maintained control over the Dridex malware project.
Denis Gusev is another key member of Evil Corp whose role has included financial facilitator and
logistics coordinator. Gusev operates six businesses based out of Russia including Biznes-Stolitsa,
OOO, Optima, OOO, Treid-Invest, OOO, TSAO, OOO, Vertikal, OOO, and Yunikom, OOO.
Other core members of the group that carry out critical activities include Dmitriy Smirnov, Artem
Yakubets, Ivan Tuchkov, Andrey Plotnitskiy, Dmitriy Slobodskoy, and Kirill Slobodskoy. These
individuals are involved in management of the Dridex malware program, supervising the targeting
process as well as other technical, financial and logistical aspects of the group. These individuals
were also named in the December 2019 indictment.
Evil Corp is known to rely heavily on money mules. Eight Moscow-based individuals who have

served as financial facilitators for Evil Corp include Aleksei Bashlikov, Ruslan Zamulko, David
Guberman, Carlos Alvares, Georgios Manidis, Tatiana Shevchuk, Azamat Safarov, and Gulsara
Burkhonova. These individuals are ensure the illicit movement of stolen money in such a way to
elude tracing by law enforcement. These individuals were also named in the December 2019
indictment.

Motivations

Evil Corp is primarily a cybercriminal group and as such, is financially motivated. This motivation often
manifests itself in the form of digital extortion, such as ransomware attacks, as well as cyberattacks that
facilitate sensitive information theft – financial or otherwise – which can then be sold on the dark web for
a profit. However, where Evil Corp distinguishes themselves from many other threat actors is how they blur
the proverbial lines between cybercriminals and state-sponsored activities. They are known to cooperate
with Russian intelligence agencies, including but not necessarily limited to the FSB. While this doesn’t
make them unique, the extent to which their activities are driven by both personal greed and a state
political agenda gives them one of the widest array of potential motivations of all the major cyber threat
actors in the world. There is speculation that Evil Corp is simply a front organization for Russian
intellgience, but it should be noted that they have stolen large sums of money from their victims over their
history of operations.

Common Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)

Evil Corp have oeprated a number of prominent malware and ransomware variants over their history and
as such, the list of tactics, techniques and protecures (TTPs) they leverage is wide. They have a wide
variety or technical capabilities due to both their in-house capabilities as well as the relationships they
have with other cybercriminal groups. They often leverage the very common tactic of phishing as wll as the
use of legitimate security tools and living-off-the-land techniques. A list of the tactics and techniques used
by Evil Corp mapped against the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be found here. The company Crowdstrike
has described some of their TTPs associated with “big game” targeting and BitPaymer in this report.
Mandiant has also examined some of their TTPs asssociated with Lockbit ransomware.

Tools and Weaponization

Evil Corp has been known to operate and maintain a number of propriatary malware variants over time
which include the following:
•

•

Dridex: Dridex malware initially developed as one of the most powerful financial trojans. It has
evolved into a very powerful, general purpose, information stealer which has dynamic command
and control capabilities, backdoor tactics and other post-exploitation functionality including
dropping additional malware. Dridex was previously known as Bugat.
Zeus: Zeus is one of the oldest banking trojans, known to operate since at least 2007 (some report
as early as 2005). Due to its source code having leaked in 2011, several variants have since been
developed which have seen its sophistication improve. Original versions of Zeus can be prevented
by any number of signature-based detection technologies, however the code continues to be
publicly available and new variants continue to be developed.

GameOver Zeus: Gameover Zeus (or GOZ) is a Zeus variant (see above) that is built specifically to
deliver ransomware as its payload. It is often spread via phishing campaigns.
JabberZeus: Also known as AquaZeus, JabberZeus is a Zeus variant that includes a instant
messenger plugin for the Jabber platform so that attackers can communicate and collaborate
activity during an attack. JabberZeus operates from certain infrastructure, samples of which can be
found here and here.
Bitpaymer: Bitpaymer, also known as Doppelpaymer and FriedEx) is a ransomware that was
developed by EvilCorp and has been known to be often dropped by Dridex and in operations since
2017. It has code similarities with Dridex.
Hades: Hades is a ransomware variant that has been in operations since December 2020. Hades is
believed to be a direct successor to Wastedlocker and is believed to have been deliberately
developed by Evil Corp for the specific purposes of evading sanctions that were announced in
2019. It leverages TTPs that are distinct and despite many ransomware variants operating publicly
and seeking affiliates and initial access brokers to partner with for attacks, Hades is operated
privately.

Report: 202208291500

Phoenixlocker – Also known simply as Phoenix, Phoenixlocker is a ransomware variant developed
by Evil Corp in 2021 and suspected to be part of their effort to evade sanctions issued in 2019. It’s
designed to look like another hacker group – Payloadbin.
SocGholish – Also known as FAKEUPDATES, SocGhoulsih is a framework of social engineering
toolkits used to drop malicious code by phony software updates as well as infected websites. Some
of these phony updates are known to mimic browser, Flash and Microsoft Teams updates.
Wastedlocker – Wastedlocker is a ransomware variant believed to be operational since May of
2020. It’s often used in multi-stage attacks and is associated with ransom demands ranging from
$500,000 to more than $10 million.

As previously mentioned, Evil Corp have a wide set of highly-capable tools at their disposal. These are
developed and maintained in-house, but are often used in conjunction with commodity malware, living-offthe-land techniques and common security tools that were designed for legitimate and lawful security
assessments. Common characteristics exist between Evil Corp’s in-house tools and they are depicted by
the Venn diagram below:

Evil Corp has also been known to use other commodity malware variants as well as publicly-available tools
in their attacks including:
• Cobalt Strike
• Covenant
• Donut
• Koadic
• Mimikatz
• Powershell Empire

Relationships

Evil Corp has strong and enduring relationships with many of the most capable and notorious
cybercriminal gangs around the world. These malware and ransomware operators include Doppel Spider,
Wizard Spider, Mummy Spider – all suspected to have members primarily in Russia but also the
Commonwealth of Independent States. In addition to Evil Corp’s in-house cyber weapon arsenal, they also
by virtue of these relationships have access to prolific malware variants such as Trickbot and Emotet, as
well as major ransomware operations such as Ryuk. These relationships, along with Evil Corp’s in-house
capabilities make them one of the world’s most powerful criminal gangs. Many of these groups and
malware variants have all been known to target the U.S. health sector agressively.

Targeting and Scope of Attacks

Evil Corp does not appear to have any geographic limitations on their targeting. Like many financiallymotivated cybercriminals, they are ostensibly motivated to attack targets of opportunity. They have been
known to engage in big game hunting: targeting larger organizations with deeper pockets. However,
georgaphically, they do have a tendency to attack targets in the United States and Europe. In terms of
sectors, they target finance, government, healthcare, media, transportation, instance, manuafacturing,
non-profits, technology and education. One of their more well-known attacks against the health sector was
the compromise of several Scottish hospitals that are a part of the NHS Lanarkshire board in 2017 with
the use of BitPaymer ransomware. The United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) Metropolitan Police
Service arrested multiple individuals who contributed to the activities of Evil Corp.

Defense and Mitigations

It is not practical to attempt to lay out a comprehensive list of defense and mitigations recommendations
and data for a group such as Evil Corp, which maintains a wide array of custom capabilities that are
continually being developed. Therefore, we will present a sample of mitigations, indicators of compromise,
Yara rules and similar defensive information:
