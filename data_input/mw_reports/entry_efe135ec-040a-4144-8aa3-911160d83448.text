A botnet discovered at the start of the year and named Hide 'N Seek (HNS) has expanded
from infecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices and is now also targeting cross-platform
database solutions as well.
This is an important development in the botnet's evolution, which also passed a significant
milestone in May when it became the first IoT malware that was capable of surviving device
reboots.

HNS now targets more devices
Now, the Netlab research team at Qihoo 360 says that HNS has expanded beyond the
scope of routers and DVRs and is now also targeting database applications running on
server operating systems.
According to Netlab researchers, the botnet is now capable of infecting the following types
of devices, with the following types of exploits:
1. TPLink-Routers RCE
2. Netgear RCE
3. (new) AVTECH RCE
1/3

4. (new) CISCO Linksys Router RCE
5. (new) JAW/1.0 RCE
6. (new) OrientDB RCE
7. (new) CouchDB RCE
As a side-effect for adding more payloads, HNS is also noisier now, as it needs to scan
more ports to find new hosts to infect. Experts say they've seen HNS bots initiating scans
on ports:
23
Telnet
80
HTTP Web Service
2480 OrientDB
5984 CouchDB
8080 HTTP Web Service
... but also random ports
But HNS was easy to spot anyway because it's only the second major IoT botnet besides
Hajime known to use a P2P structure, so security researchers would have an easy time
identifying it regardless.

HNS testing coinminer payload
HNS is not the first botnet to target OrientDB servers, which have become quite the favorite
among various botnets. For example, DDG, a botnet discovered last year, which is still alive
today, has targeted OrientDB servers in the past with cryptocurrency-mining malware.
In fact, it appears that HNS operators might have learned something from the DDG crew
because Netlab says HNS has also started dropping a coinminer payload on some of the
infected systems.
Fortunately, for the time being, it appears that these deployments have all failed, as the
additional coinminer payload failed to start and generate funds for the HNS operators.
But if they manage to get it up and running, they'll be in for some profits, as the DDG gang
collected well over $1 million from their coinmining last year.
The Netlab team has published an in-depth analysis of the changes in HNS compared to its
previous variant spotted back in January.
