Sweden drops Russian hacking investigation due to legal
complications

The Swedish government dropped today its investigation into the 2017 hack of its sports
authority, citing the legal constraints that would have prevented prosecutors from charging
the Russian hackers responsible for the intrusion, which officials claimed were mere pawns
operating on behalf of a “foreign power.”
This marks the first time that such a legal clause is cited by prosecutors investigating cyberespionage hacking groups.

SSC hack part of Russia’s anti-WADA campaign
Today’s statement from the Swedish Prosecution Authority also marks the first time that
Swedish officials formally blamed the Russian government for the 2017 hack of the Swedish
Sports Confederation (SSC).
Citing a recently-concluded investigation from the Swedish Security Service, which also
involved foreign intelligence services, Swedish prosecutors said that one of Russia’s military
hacker groups breached its sports body between December 2017 and May 2018 and stole
medical records for Swedish athletes.

“The investigation shows that the Russian military intelligence, GRU who, via its 85th
Center, also known as unit 26165, has planned and carried out the serious breaches of data
secrecy against the Swedish Sports Confederation,” public prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said
today.
Ljungqvist said the SSC hack was part of a larger Russian hacking campaign that targeted
sports bodies all over the world, including national and international anti-doping
organizations such as WADA, USADA, and FIFA.
Russian military hackers stole athletes’ medical records and then published the information
online.
Posing as a hacktivist group, the Russian hackers claimed they were exposing a secret
conspiracy in sporting federations across the world that allowed certain professional athletes
to take doping substances using medical conditions as an excuse.
“The information has been published openly and, based on these details, Swedish media
have written articles which follow GRU’s narrative of discrediting athletes and sports
organisations in the West,” Ljungqvist said.
But the hacking campaign was later exposed as a Russian influence operation orchestrated
by the Russian government through its GRU service as revenge after Russian athletes had
been banned from the Rio Olympics after a whistleblower exposed a Russian state-backed
doping program in a 2014 ARD documentary.

Sweden says there’s no legal background to prosecute state hackers
The hacks touched many countries around the world, and the US Department of Justice filed
legal charges against seven GRU intelligence service members in October 2018.
But Ljungqvist said today that Swedish authorities wouldn’t be following the US lead’s on this
case, citing that the hackers acted on behalf of “a foreign power.”
As such, Ljungqvist says there is no legal backing to support Swedish authorities in charging
the hackers and requesting their extradition to face charges for their crimes.
This marks the first time that a country claims it can’t file charges against hackers acting on
behalf of a government due to a lack of legal background.
Until now, countries like Germany and the US are the only ones who formally charged
Russian state hackers for intrusions carried out against their networks. Countries like the UK,
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Norway have blamed Russian state hackers for
attacks against their infrastructure but have not yet formally filed charges against specific
individuals.

Smart political maneuver on the part of Swedish officials
In an online conversation today, Stefan Soesanto, Senior Cyber Defence Researcher at the
Center for Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, told
The Record that he agreed with the Swedish government’s decision.
“The way I interpret Ljungqvist announcement is that simply because the GRU (i.e., a foreign
power) conducted the operation, there is (a) a zero chance of success for requesting
extradition of the GRU operators from Moscow so they can be prosecuted on Swedish soil.
And (b) there is literally zero chance that the Russian public prosecutor will open up a case
and charge the GRU operatives if the Swedish Sports Confederation (or the Swedish
government) goes to court in Russia,” Soesanto told us.
In that sense all the legal avenues for successfully prosecuting the GRU operators are
non-existent.

“In my opinion that is a very realistic assessment by Ljungqvist, which also additionally helps
the Swedish government to avoid unnecessary political confrontation with Moscow over an
incident that happened four years ago,” Soesanto added.
“Granted, the Swedes could have gone the US and German route, but then again, those
approaches have not resulted in the successful extradition and prosecution of GRU
operators either.”
