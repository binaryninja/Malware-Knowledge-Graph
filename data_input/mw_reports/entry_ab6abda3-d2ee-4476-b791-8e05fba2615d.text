Summary
Emotet, a Trojan that is primarily spread through spam emails, has been a prevalent issue
since its first appearance in 2014. With a network made up of multiple botnets, denoted as
“epochs” by security research team Cryptolaemus, Emotet has continuously sent out spam
emails in campaigns designed to infect users via phishing attacks. Once it is successfully
running on an endpoint, Emotet drops other malicious programs such as Qakbot, Cobalt
Strike, or in some cases, even the notorious Ryuk ransomware. However, as of July 2022,
the heavily distributed Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) seemingly went dark, and no longer
appeared to be running these spam campaigns.
For the next four months, Emotet remained silent. Then, on November 2, the Cryptolaemus
group found that its botnets, particularly those known as Epoch4 and Epoch5, had begun
sending out spam emails once again. These phishing emails used various methods to lure

1/11

victims into first opening them, and then downloading and executing .xls files, with macros
used to download the Emotet dropper. With as little fanfare as when it went dark, it seems
that Emotet has returned, appearing to be as malicious as ever.

Emotet’s Growing Toolbox of Modules
Since its inception, Emotet has continued to steadily evolve, adding new techniques for
evasion and increasing its likelihood of successful infections. It is also able to host an array
of modules, each used for different aspects of information theft that report back to their
command-and-control (C2) servers. From process monitoring to grabbing Microsoft®
Outlook® email addresses, Emotet has been observed to inject both proprietary modules
and readily available freeware tools, adding and tweaking them over the years with
alarming effectiveness. More recently, Emotet has added a new Server Message Block
(SMB) spreader module, used as an effective method for lateral movement once placed on
a target machine.
The SMB spreader starts this process by gaining the same security privileges as the initial
target account. Once loaded onto a victim’s system, this module begins impersonating that
user by duplicating their account token via the SecurityImpersonation level. This gives a
process the same privileges as the current user on that system. With these duplicated
privileges, the spreader calls a function “ImpersonateLoggedOnUser” to perform actions in
the same security context of the account that is currently logged in. Pseudocode for the use
of this function can be seen in Figure 1.

From here, the module begins enumerating network resources using the WinAPIs
WnetOpenEnumW and WnetEnumResourceW. Of these resources, it saves any potential
remote servers to a list. Then, using two additional hardcoded lists (one of common
usernames, another of common passwords), the spreader will iterate over this list of server
names and begin bruteforcing the IPC$ share with the WinAPI WNetAddConnection2W in
hopes of a successful connection.

If no connection is made with the credentials at hand, the SMB spreader can also attempt to
seek additional usernames from the server being targeted with the NetUserEnum WinAPI.
Any potential new usernames found will also be bruteforced with the hardcoded list of
passwords to login to the IPC$ share.

If a connection succeeds, the spreader finally attempts to connect to either the ADMIN$ and
C$ shares. From there, it finally copies the Emotet loader to said share and launches it as a
service. The service executes with regsvr32.exe, and lateral movement is achieved.
Along with the SMB spreader, another recently added module is used to target a victim’s
Google Chrome™ browser in the hopes of stealing stored credit card information. While
Emotet has used other modules for digging out financial information in the past (such as
NirSoft’s WebBrowser PassView module), Proofpoint found the following decrypted strings
in early June 2022 that appear to be looking at Chrome™ specifically.

A Demon at Heaven’s Gate
To load some of its previously used modules, Emotet has been observed to use an injection
technique known as Heaven’s Gate. Made popular in the mid-2000s, Heaven’s Gate is an
infamous method used by malware to bypass Windows® on Windows64 (WoW64) API
hooks, by taking malicious 32-bit processes to inject into 64-bit processes. This technique
works because while many security products monitor file activity by hooking 32-bit APIs
(CreateFile, WriteFile, OpenFile), when running 64-bit code, an opportunity is presented to
completely bypass many system calls which would render the malicious code segments far
too noisy.
3/11

In the interests of backwards compatibility, WoW64 actually allows 32-bit applications to be
run on 64-bit systems too. When a 32-bit application is run, both the 32-bit and 64-bit
version of ntdll.dll is loaded. While a 32-bit process would normally pass through the 32-bit
API hooks, malicious processes can perform a jump instruction past these hooks in order to
execute 64-bit code. This allows the injection of any malicious code to be run without setting
off immediate alerts via system calls. Windows initially developed this on the assumption
that the 64-bit ntdll.dll could not be accessed by a 32-bit process, but Heaven’s Gate takes
advantage of this by running x64 instructions which will be completely missed by any
application expecting x86 instructions. Heaven’s Gate was therefore an early exploit on 64bit systems that is still used to this day.
Once through Heaven’s Gate, Emotet loaders will use a technique known as process
hollowing to suspend a legitimate process, then remap its image with malicious code. The
malicious code will then be able to run from the now hollowed out process in order to load
modules at will.

New Trap, New Bait
With the newest wave of Emotet spam emails, the attached .xls files have a new method for
tricking users into allowing macros to download the dropper. In addition to this, new Emotet
variants have now moved from 32bit to 64bit, as another method for evading detection. It
seems that Emotet has utilized its time offline to refine/retool itself and come back with
stronger attacks and more intricate methods of spreading than ever before. We’ll go into
more detail on this below.

Technical Analysis

4/11

Studying Emotet’s most recent campaign, it’s clear that a variety of different emails have
been generated to lure victims into downloading the malicious attachment. While this
method of infection is certainly nothing new, there appears to be one clever twist in the
threat actor’s attempts to convince users to compromise their own machines.
When a user downloads an .xls attachment from one of these phishing emails, the infection
vector is entirely dependent on the user enabling macros to download the Emotet dropper.
Now, all files downloaded from the Internet, including email attachments such as Excel®
files, are given a special flag from Microsoft by default. Known as a Mark-of-the-Web
(MOTW) flag, this is a security feature originally introduced by Internet Explorer® to force
saved web pages to run in the same security zone that the page was saved from. What this
does is it basically forces programs to treat certain types of files more cautiously. For
instance, an Excel file bearing a MotW flag will be opened in Protected View, which
automatically disables macros; this is very bad news for Emotet.
In order to bypass this built-in security functionality, Emotet infections rely instead on good
old-fashioned social engineering to manually override these protections. Users are finally
getting more savvy when it comes to identifying suspicious attachments, but this new
variant does something particularly sneaky. In an .xls attachment
(ef2ce641a4e9f270eea626e8e4800b0b97b4a436c40e7af30aeb6f02566b809c) sent in this
new spam campaign conducted by the Epoch4 botnet, users are instructed to move the
newly-downloaded file into Excel’s ‘Templates’ folder, as shown below in Figure 4.
Seeing as this folder is automatically trusted by Microsoft, any file executed from here is
ignored by the Protected View functionality, allowing any macros to run without hinderance.

Once the macros are run, they reach out to the Internet to download and execute the
Emotet malware. Looking at Figures 5 and 6, you can see the macros used by the .xls file,
as well as the malicious URLs used to download Emotet. In Figure 7, you can see the
macros from a different variant of this .xls file
(199a2e0e1bb46a5dd8eb3a58aa55de157f6005c65b70245e71cecec4905cc2c0) reaching
out to alternate web URLS.

Figure 5, 6, and 7 – URLs used by macros to download Emotet droppers
From here, the Emotet dropper is downloaded to a randomly generated folder under
%UserProfile%\AppData\Local as a .dll file. This .dll file is also given a randomly generated
name. Once downloaded, macros use regsvr32.exe to execute Emotet, as shown in Figure
8.

Figure 9 – Registry key created for persistence
At this point, Emotet will run in the background, reaching out to its C2 server in order to
download additional malware. It also achieves persistence on the system by creating the
registry key shown in Figure 9 so that it may stay active on the local machine, awaiting
further instruction.

The Endgame of Emotet
Emotet, as a MaaS, focuses on the spreading of other malware. Considered to be one of
the most widely disseminated malware distributors, its resurgence has been met with great
concern by the industry. With the introduction of more insidious variants designed to bypass
automatic security checkpoints, it now appears that its dropper is being used to download
banking Trojan IcedID. It achieves this by downloading an installer, which then downloads a
separate binary file from the URL hxxps[:]//bayernbadabum[.]com/botpack[.]dat in order to
drop the final payload onto the victim’s machine.

Figure 10 – URL used to download IcedID banking Trojan
As if Emotet’s inbuilt module for stealing credit card information isn’t bad enough, its
secondary payload IcedID is more sinister still. Otherwise known as BokBot, IcedID is a
modular Trojan well-known for stealing financial information. While also establishing
persistence through process hollowing, it in itself is fully capable of dropping additional
malware. IcedID monitors and logs Internet browser activity in order to steal sensitive
information such as login details for online banking sessions. In a recently found sample of
IcedID dropped by new Emotet variants, a legitimate pdb path can even be seen within the
file’s strings. This may speak for how ‘fresh’ this variant is, or possibly even still in active
development.

Bumblebee, a malware loader believed to be distributed by the Conti syndicate, has also
been reported as a payload being dropped by the new Emotet variants. The dropper will
download a PowerShell script that reaches out to a separate URL to download and execute
the Bumblebee DLL using rundll32.exe.

Conclusion
With its steady evolution over the last eight-plus years, Emotet has continued to become
more sophisticated in terms of evasion tactics; has added additional modules in an effort to
further propagate itself, and is now spreading malware via phishing campaigns. While it
may have been dormant for a few months, it has now returned with a vengeance, making it
a threat to be reckoned with for business and individual users alike.

Mitigation Tips
Anyone can be affected by Emotet. Always remain cautious when opening email
attachments, regardless of file type.
Be sure to carefully read all security popups when you’re being asked to manually
enable something on your machine, particularly macros.
Monitor accounts for unusual and unauthorized access that falls outside of the
baseline (MITRE D3FEND™ techniques D3-AZET, D3-LAM).
