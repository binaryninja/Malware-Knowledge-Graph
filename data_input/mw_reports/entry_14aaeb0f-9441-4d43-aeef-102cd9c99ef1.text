Foreword
Sven Sakkov
Director, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence

In mid-January 2014, the Ukrainian Rada passed tough anti-protest regulations that
seemed to be designed to nip the emerging anti-government mood in the bud. Over
the next months, in the harsh Ukrainian winter, opposition protests escalated and
turned bloody. The ensuing turmoil included a runaway President, Russian occupation of Crimea and an armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
The world held its breath and many expected to see a full-fledged ‘cyber war’.
However, although an increase in typical cyber skirmishes was reported throughout
the crisis, prominent cyber operations with destructive effects have not yet occurred.
The possible reasons for this seemingly low-level employment of cyber attacks in
Ukraine characterise the particular role of cyber operations in modern conflicts.
The case of Ukraine proves that the use of cyber operations has to be understood
in the wider strategic context. In Ukraine we saw – in line with national doctrine –
that Russian information warfare both included and relied upon cyber elements.
Reported cyber incidents such as defacements, information leaks or DDoS attacks
against media or governmental organisations were predominantly in support of the
intense Russian information operation against Ukraine and the West.
Furthermore, due to the historical interconnectedness of networks and sophisticated spyware tools applied by APT groups, it is widely presumed that Russia is actively
leveraging the intelligence provided by its effective cyber espionage campaigns for
strategic gain. As cyberspace functions as the main medium for disseminating and
gathering information, destructive cyber operations hindering information flows in
Ukraine would have been unreasonable from the Russian point of view.
Another strategic consideration affecting Russian use of cyber attacks is the relative effectiveness of traditional kinetic operations. If we look at the Russian actions
in Crimea and the Donbass, there was no practical need to engage in destructive
8

offensive cyber operations to achieve the military objectives. For instance, one of the
first targets during the occupation of Crimea was an Internet Exchange Point, which
was taken over by Russian special forces in order to assure information superiority
by disrupting cable connections with the mainland. In short, the case indicates that
kinetic actions might in some circumstances be more effective and less costly than
sophisticated cyber operations. This factor is even more relevant in Ukraine, where
the infrastructure is often outdated and not highly IT-dependent.
Even though highly visible and destructive attacks have not been reported, information-oriented cyber operations in Ukraine have nevertheless functioned as an
essential strategic element of Russian whole spectrum warfare.
In brief, the book reflects several mutually reinforcing reasons why we did not
witness large-scale or massive cyber attacks with destructive effects:
• Espionage and information campaigns conducted through cyberspace
trumped other considerations for the Russian side;
• It is reasonable to achieve results with less resources and effort involved,
i.e. if a cable can be cut physically, there is no need to use sophisticated
cyber attacks;
• Both sides in the conflict have shown a considerable ability to control
the escalation of the conflict. The cyber domain did not witness largescale warfighting, but neither did the domain of air after the tragedy of
MH17;
• Ukraine did not offer very lucrative targets for destructive cyber
attacks.
To put these points into perspective: modern war is a messy affair, not a clean
and glittery Hollywood movie. The emergence of cyber as a separate domain of
warfighting does not necessarily offer magic solutions and miraculous short-cuts to
achieve strategic goals. As of November 2015, the case has shown that destructive
cyber operations are not (yet) a silver bullet in the arsenal of states which still operate below certain thresholds due to legal and political considerations and uncertainties over escalation. Nevertheless, we have to keep in mind that the conflict in
Ukraine is not yet over – the level and nature of cyber attacks can change rapidly, as
the political-military environment in Ukraine remains unstable and unpredictable.
Against the backdrop of the often unclear debate on so-called ‘hybrid warfare’
and its cyber elements, this publication offers a ‘reality check’ for policy-makers,
scholars and the media to understand the ‘haze’ of cyber war. This is done by applying an interdisciplinary approach as our book involves 17 subject-matter experts
analysing the strategic, policy, legal and technical aspects of the case.
The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence would like to thank
all of the book’s authors, and especially the editor, Centre Ambassador Kenneth
Geers, for their contributions to the project.

2013–2014

Geopolitical Events

November 2013 – Ukrainian President Yanukovych’s cabinet rejects the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement, igFebruary 2014
niting anti-government protests in Kyiv. Demonstrations gather pace in January and February
of 2014 and culminate when clashes between protesters and government turn deadly. As a
result, Yanukovich flees to Russia and the Parliament names Turchynov as interim President.
27 February –
16 March

On February 27, pro-Russian gunmen in combat uniforms – dubbed ‘little green men’ – occupy Crimea and seize strategic sites. On March 16, 97% of voters reportedly back Crimea’s
unrecognised referendum to join Russia. The EU and US agree on a first round of sanctions
against Russia; several rounds follow as the crisis progresses.

April – May

Armed conflict begins in eastern Ukraine. The first casualties between pro-Russian separatists
and Ukrainian government forces are reported on April 17. Unrecognised referendums are
held. Separatists declare independence in Donetsk and Luhansk on May 11.

25 May

Petro Poroshenko is elected President of Ukraine.

17 June

Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur is shot down over eastern
Ukraine, leaving nearly 300 dead. Shortly after the crash, the Security Service (SBU) of Ukraine
releases an intercepted phone call purportedly between separatists in eastern Ukraine, discussing the fact that they shot down the plane.

September

The Minsk Protocol is signed by representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the Donetsk People’s Republic, and the Lugansk People’s Republic. A ceasefire agreement fails to stop
fighting in Donbass as fierce fighting for Donetsk’s airport erupts.

26 October

Parliamentary elections are held: Poroshenko’s Bloc wins and pro-western parties dominate the
new political landscape.

2015
January –
February

The Minsk Protocol ceasefire fails as heavy fighting continues. After weeks of fighting, on 22
January, Ukrainian forces withdraw from the main terminal of the strategically important Donetsk airport.
On February 11, new talks start in Minsk to achieve a new peace deal. Parties agree to a pullout of heavy weaponry, but sporadic clashes continue. After heavy fighting in Debaltseve,
Ukrainian forces retreat on 18 February.

March

The UN reports that an estimated 6,000 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine since 2014.

August –
September

The most recent ceasefire, agreed by the contact group in late August, appears to be holding, as
fighting is at its lowest point since the beginning of the conflict.

Prominent Cyber Incidents1
Sporadic cyber skirmishes, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and website defacements, accompany events throughout the crisis. Prominent examples include Russia Today’s (RT) altered
headlines with the word ‘Nazi’ added and DDoS attacks against the NATO and NATO CCD COE websites, which are briefly taken offline during the Euromaidan protests.
Private sector reports announce that advanced persistent threat (APT) cyber espionage tools have
been discovered in Ukraine and in NATO countries. Malware analysis suggests that the campaigns are
based in Russia. New and more menacing forms of malware include Turla/Uroburos/Snake, RedOctober,
MiniDuke, and NetTraveler.
Anonymous users or hacktivist groups such as CyberBerkut continuously leak stolen, sensitive information. For example, on February 4 2014, a phone call between the US Assistant Secretary of State and
the US Ambassador to Ukraine, which includes derisive comments regarding the EU, is uploaded to
YouTube.
At the Euromaidan street demonstrations, there are physical and cyber attacks against opposition servers,
smartphones, websites, and Internet accounts; the most serious incidents coincide with the lethal shooting of protestors.
During the occupation of Crimea, Russian special forces seize an Internet Exchange Point (IXP) and sever Internet cables. According to Ukrainian intelligence, an ‘IP-telephonic’ attack originating from Crimea
targets the mobile devices of Ukrainian parliament members. Hackers also leak stolen data, including a
bugged phone call between the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the EU, which fuels conspiracy
theories and appears to support the Russian narrative regarding sniper shootings at Euromaidan.
Ukrainian officials report a sophisticated cyber attack against the Ukrainian Central Election Commission on May 21-25 2014. DDoS attacks impede information exchange. A computer virus is launched to
undermine the credibility of the elections and presents false election results to the official election website.
Specialists contain the virus, but the Russian TV station Channel One nonetheless airs the fake results.
Media reports describe a ‘troll factory’ in St. Petersburg, Russia, where hundreds of people are allegedly
creating pro-Russian government content for both domestic and international social media. This
analysis highlights the active use of social media as a prominent threat vector for information operations.
A private sector report claims that a Russian cyber espionage campaign has targeted the MH17 investigation being conducted by Dutch, Malaysian, Australian, Belgian, and Ukrainian authorities.
In eastern Ukraine, signals intelligence (SIGINT) operations make use of Internet data (e.g. location
data from mobile phones and Wi-Fi networks) to locate and target Ukrainian military forces. Hacktivists
on both sides continue to leak sensitive or compromising data to support their cause. In one case, hackers
access public CCTV cameras in eastern Ukraine. The region has been isolated from the rest of Ukraine
via Internet censorship and regular forensics checks on citizens’ computers and mobile devices.

Introduction:
Cyber War in Perspective
Kenneth Geers
NATO CCD COE1 / Atlantic Council /
Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv

Cyber war is a hot topic. Armed forces, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies have made computer security – from defence to offence – a top priority for
investment and recruitment. In fact, current efforts to take the higher ground in
cyberspace are so intense that many governments will overreach, with unfortunate
ramifications for democracy and human rights around the world.
The current Russo-Ukrainian conflict appears to have all the necessary ingredients for cyber war. Moscow and Kyiv, and indeed the entire NATO Alliance, are
playing for the highest geopolitical stakes. Russia has already annexed Crimea, and
there is an ongoing military standoff in eastern Ukraine. Both countries possess a
high level of expertise in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM),
which has naturally led to an aptitude for, and experience with, computer hacking.
Despite these factors, there are still

This book serves as a benchmark in the early history of Internet-era warfare. For
world leaders and system administrators alike, the ‘cyber dimension’ of the Ukraine
crisis offers many lessons and sheds light on whether cyber war is still closer to science fiction than reality. The research is divided into five sections: Strategic Framework, Tactical Viewpoints, Information Warfare, Policy and Law, and The Future.
Each chapter has been written by a leading expert in national security, network
security, or both. It has been a pleasure and an honour to work with all of them.
Many thanks to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE) for sponsoring this research.
Cyber War in Perspective: Russian Aggression against Ukraine opens with a chapter by Russia scholar Keir Giles of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in Oxford,
UK. Keir offers deep insight into the background to this crisis, and explains why
it may not be resolved any time soon. Russia and the West are said to have two
distinct views of the world. Moscow is unlikely to tolerate true independence and
sovereignty for its former Soviet satellite states, and remains vehemently opposed
to Western support for them. It has many strategies and tactics – traditional and
cyber – that it can employ against Ukraine and its other neighbours, while the West
is both hesitant and divided.
In Chapter 3, James J. Wirtz, Dean of the Naval Postgraduate School in California, describes the global context surrounding these events. Today, nation-states are
integrating cyber tactics into their political and military strategies. Professor Wirtz
posits that when it comes to the use of cyber, ‘national styles’ might be emerging as
states attempt to use cyber capabilities to achieve strategic objectives. He suggests
that it is wrong to treat cyber attacks as a silver bullet, and that it is better to consider
how a sort of combined arms approach will prevail. On a positive note, the need
for legal and bureaucratic integration of policies and programmes should produce
national idiosyncrasies on the cyber battlefield that can help with the vexing challenge of attribution.
James Andrew Lewis of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS) analyses the geopolitical effects of cyber attacks in Chapter 4. He discusses
two metrics: strategic effects that diminish an opponent’s will or capacity to fight
(e.g. influencing public opinion) and tactical effects that degrade military power
(e.g. confusing troops, or denying service to weapons). Success is premised upon
observable, real-world effects. In Ukraine, Russian cyber operations had no strategic effect and only a limited, short-term political effect.
In Chapter 5, RAND’s Martin Libicki takes one of this book’s strongest stances.
He asks why, despite the existence of a hot military conflict and ample hacker talent, there is no cyber war in Ukraine. There have been hacktivist outbursts, web
defacements, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and cyber espionage,
but everything we have seen so far falls well short of how national security thinkers
– and Hollywood – have portrayed cyber war. Libicki explores several possible reasons. Does Ukraine not possess cyber-enabled critical infrastructures? Are Russia

14

and Ukraine wary of taking (or escalating) their conflict into the cyber domain? Or
are our notions of cyber war simply overrated?
Nikolay Koval, head of Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT-UA) during the revolution, describes in Chapter 6 how cyber attacks rose in
parallel with ongoing political events, in both number and severity. In 2012, hackers
‘defaced’ Ukrainian government websites with politically motivated digital graffiti.
In 2013, network defenders discovered new and more menacing forms of malware,
such as RedOctober, MiniDuke, and NetTraveler. In 2014, hacktivist groups such as
CyberBerkut published stolen Ukrainian Government documents. Koval analyses
in detail the most technically advanced attack investigated by CERT-UA: the May
2014 compromise of Ukraine’s Central Election Commission (CEC). He closes by
appealing to the Ukrainian Government to allocate greater funds to hire and retain
qualified personnel.
In Chapter 7, ISACA Kyiv researcher Glib Pakharenko has written a first-hand
account of cyber attacks during the revolution in Ukraine. At the EuroMaidan street
demonstrations, there were physical and logical attacks against opposition servers,
smartphones, websites, and Internet accounts; the most serious incidents coincided
with the lethal shooting of protestors. In Crimea, attacks ranged from severing network cables to commandeering satellites to wholesale changes in Wikipedia. In eastern Ukraine, cyber espionage such as the use of location data from mobile phones
and Wi-Fi networks has aided in targeting Ukrainian army units; the region has also
been isolated from the rest of Ukraine by Internet censorship and regular forensics
checks on citizens’ computers and mobile devices. Pakharenko ends this chapter by
providing the Ukrainian Government with a significant ‘to do’ list of best practices
in network security.
FireEye’s Jen Weedon, in Chapter 8, discusses Russia’s strategic use of computer
network exploitation (i.e. cyber espionage). Today, via the Internet, intelligence
agencies can gather information on an industrial scale, which can be used for any
purpose, including tactical support to military operations. From a targeting perspective, Weedon discusses strategies for creating a decisive information advantage,
‘prepping’ a battlefield through denial and deception, and how hackers might even
cause real-world physical destruction; and details the technical aspects of suspected
Russian cyber operations, including malware samples, hacker tactics, and compromised infrastructure.
In Chapter 9, Tim Maurer of the New America Foundation explores the role
that non-state, ‘proxy’ cyber actors have played in the Ukraine crisis. In both Russia
and Ukraine, there is ample private sector computer hacking expertise which each
government would theoretically have an incentive to exploit for efficacy and plausible deniability. However, throughout this crisis, there has counterintuitively been
very limited proxy use. There have been a few dubious ‘hacktivist’ attacks, but expert
volunteers and cyber criminals do not appear to have been politicised or mobilised to any significant degree in support of geopolitical cyber campaigns. Criminal

15

behaviour remains largely profit-driven. In particular, the Ukrainian Government
has not shown a capacity to harness volunteer cyber expertise, as Russia is thought
to have done during its previous crises with Estonia and Georgia.
Swedish Defence University researcher Margarita Levin Jaitner highlights current Russian Information Warfare (IW) theMoscow has an inherent ory in Chapter 10. She contends that Moscow
has an inherent belief in the power of inforbelief in the power of

information control.
military goals. In Russian doctrine, cyber
security is subordinate to information security, and cyberspace is only one part of the ‘information space’. National security
planners are concerned with both ‘technical’ and ‘cognitive’ attacks, and recognise
that achieving information superiority involves everything from propaganda to
hacking to kinetic military operations. Margarita Jaitner argues that the annexation
of Crimea was a textbook case in information superiority.
In Chapter 11, Liisa Past, a NATO CCD COE expert on strategic communications, analyses leadership discourse. Liisa Past reveals that Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko have employed similar
rhetorical strategies, including the development of an ‘us vs. them’ dichotomy in
which the in-group is portrayed as constructive and solution-oriented, while the
out-group is illegitimate and dangerous. In their current conflict, neither Russia nor
Ukraine denies that cyberspace is a domain of warfare, but neither has stressed its
importance. Russian political discourse has mostly overlooked cyber issues (which
is in line with Russian military doctrine), while Ukraine has framed them within the
larger concept of ‘hybrid warfare’. The most notable difference in political rhetoric is
Kyiv’s clear orientation to the West and NATO, while Moscow is keenly focused on
Russian national interests.
Elina Lange-Ionatamishvili and Sanda Svetoka of the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence in Latvia, in Chapter 12, discuss the role of social
media in this conflict. In the Internet era, the battle for hearts and minds has never
been more important. Social media is a trust-based network that provides fertile soil
for intelligence collection, propaganda dissemination, and psychological operations
(PSYOPS) to influence public opinion – or to lead adversaries into harm’s way. ‘Soft’
cyber attacks can be as severe as any attack on critical infrastructure. In Ukraine,
they have generated fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the economic, cultural, and
national security of Ukraine, while promoting positive messages about Russia’s role
in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. The authors provide recommendations for defence
against such attacks, including how to identify them, challenge them, and how to
develop a resilient political narrative to withstand false propaganda.
In Chapter 13, University of Michigan doctoral student Nadiya Kostyuk reviews
Ukraine’s cyber security policy – past, present, and future. She analyses numerous
historical factors that make Ukraine a cyber safe haven: a strong science, technol-

16

ogy, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, underwhelming economic
performance since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and social norms which
dictate that stealing from the West is not a bad thing. The icing on the cake is that
there are currently few cyber security regulations in Ukraine. All of these factors
shed light on the vexing challenge of containing cyber crime in the region. Looking toward the future, Nadiya Kostyuk argues that Ukraine’s political, military, and
economic crises will inhibit the stabilisation of Ukrainian cyberspace for some time.
Lt Col Jan Stinissen of the NATO CCD COE, in Chapter 14, offers a legal framework for cyber operations in Ukraine. He explains that international law applies
to cyberspace, and the law of armed conflict applies to all relevant cyber operations. Jan discusses the legal definitions of ‘war’ and ‘cyberwar’, as well as the concepts of ‘armed conflict’, ‘armed attack’, and ‘use of force’. Typically, cyber attacks do
not come in isolation, but rather as one element of a larger military operation; the
wider context will determine the legal framework for its cyber component. There
are many qualifying factors including state vs. non-state actor, and armed conflict
vs. law enforcement. In the Ukraine crisis, operations in Crimea (which has already
been annexed by Russia) may be viewed differently from those in eastern Ukraine.
Stinissen asserts that, globally, most known cyber attacks have simply not been serious enough to be governed by the law of armed conflict, but that this is likely to
change in the future.
In Chapter 15, NATO CCD COE researcher Henry Rõigas discusses the impact
of known cyber attacks in Ukraine on proposed political cyber ‘norms’, the rules of
state behaviour in international relations. On the positive side, the absence of attacks
against critical infrastructure could be a boon to future international security and
stability, especially if it is a result of intentional restraint on the part of Moscow and
Kyiv. This case challenges the prevailing perception that a loose normative framework currently allows states to employ cyber attacks as a tool for coercion. On the
negative side, the examples of computer network operations we have seen appear to
violate the information security norms promoted by Russia and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), as they seem to constitute a war on information itself,
that is a dedicated effort to alter public opinion through deceptive propaganda.
Finnish Professor Jarno Limnéll, in Chapter 16, discusses the ramifications
of the Ukraine war, and its cyber component, for Russia’s neighbours. Moscow’s
aggressive behaviour in Ukraine has forced many countries to re-evaluate their
political and military relationships, especially with NATO. For historical reasons,
Finland and Estonia are well positioned to analyse Russia’s use of hybrid warfare,
including information operations. Today, these countries are actively pursuing ways
to bolster their national defences against Russia’s military strategies and tactics in
Ukraine. The NATO Alliance should take concrete measures to reassure its member
states, such as the creation of a common cyber defence framework.
In Chapter 17, Jason Healey and Michelle Cantos of Columbia University
imagine four potential cyber conflict scenarios in this crisis. First, even if the hot

17

war cools off, Russia can still raise the temperature in cyberspace, and cause serious
network disruptions in Ukraine. Second, Russia could selectively target the West,
adding a new vector to its already increased
volume of threats, military exercises, subHostile nation-state

Internet. And fourth, if the Ukraine conflict
spins out of control, Russia, in desperation, might even have the power to take down
the Internet entirely.
To close our book, in Chapter 18, Brookings Institution Nonresident Senior
Fellow Richard Bejtlich offers essential advice not only for Ukraine, but for any
nation or organisation wishing to improve its cyber security posture. Bejtlich draws
from the deep well of classic military doctrine, arguing that hostile nation-state
cyber operations are not a single event but a long-term, dynamic, multidimensional
threat. The only hope that Ukraine or any other nation has for building an effective defence against professional network attacks is to incorporate strategic thinking
into its defensive architecture, personnel, and operations.

The View from Moscow

The crisis around Ukraine is part of a wider confrontation between Russia and the West,
which has persisted at varying degrees of intensity since the fall of the Soviet Union
despite periods when the West as a whole refused to recognise that any conflict of strategic interest with Russia existed. After a period where this confrontation lay relatively
dormant, the conflict in Ukraine results from the culmination of two important trends
in the Russian view of itself and the world: first, a greater and more urgent perception
of threat, whether real or imagined, to Russia’s own security; and second, a recognition
that Russia itself has regained sufficient strength, military and otherwise, to assert itself.
The notion that Russia is faced with an existential threat – even when that threat
is imperceptible from outside Russia – has multiple and complex origins. Some of
these are permanent and persistent; for example, the idea of vulnerability of Russia’s
borders, which leads to the conviction that in order to protect its borders Russia must
exert control far beyond them. In the last century this was one of the drivers for Soviet
ultimatums to the Baltic states and Finland which eventually led to their invasion in
1939. This continuing perception feeds into the current portrayal by Russia of NATO
enlargement, including to those same Baltic states, as a threat. Regardless of NATO’s
intent, it presents a menace simply by ‘approaching Russia’s borders’.1

Russian Federation’ and its predecessors.

Other, more recent developments have heightened the sense of urgency for
Russian security planners. The fear that the West is considering bringing about
regime change in Russia does not stand up to objective scrutiny, but appears
deep-rooted among a broad sector of the Russian security elite. It

ther unrestrained and irresponsible
interventions by the West with the
intention of regime change, leaving chaos and disorder in their wake. Western
action in Libya and support for anti-government rebels in Syria provide prime
examples.
Thus the prospect of destabilisation closer to home in Ukraine would have
been of even more acute and direct concern in Moscow. Even without the
accompanying disorder, the threat of the ‘loss’ of Ukraine to the West posed
an immediate military problem: it appears to have been considered plausible in
Moscow that this presented an immediate danger of losing the Black Sea Fleet’s
base in Sevastopol, together with the often-overlooked supporting infrastructure scattered across the Crimean peninsula, to NATO. According to Secretary
of the Russian Security Council Nikolay Patrushev, the consequences could be
even more far-reaching: ‘Americans are trying to involve the Russian Federation
in interstate military conflict, to facilitate the change of power by way of using
the events in Ukraine, and ultimately to carve up our country.’2 Whether this
view is sincerely held by the Russian leadership or not, it is the one that is consistently presented to the Russian public, and to its Armed Forces, as explaining
the roots of the current conflict.
The fact that Russia was able to use large numbers of Special Operations Forces
(SOF) swiftly and effectively to seize control of Crimea, and subsequently to wage
an ongoing low-level campaign in eastern Ukraine involving long-term mobilisation of its conventional forces, is a pointer to the other key element of the new Russian approach to confrontation; the recognition that Russia is now in a position to
exercise a much more assertive foreign policy than in the recent past.
One element of this is the unprecedented and expensive overhaul and rearmament of Russia’s Armed Forces which began after the armed conflict with
Georgia in 2008 and continues today. The fact that the Russian troops at work

to act in a coordinated manner.3
The results of this coordination has left the unprepared West scrambling for a
response, and struggling even to define the phenomenon, as witness the tortuous
attempts by NATO and Western governments to decide what precisely constitutes
‘hybrid warfare’. But the notion of hybridity as applied to the current concept
meets little understanding in Moscow. Instead, Russia can be said simply to be
attempting to implement grand strategy in the classical sense. Russia’s attempt
at this whole of government approach to managing conflict is embodied in the
National Defence Control Centre in central Moscow, where a wide range of different government ministries and agencies including those responsible for energy,
the economy, ecology and more are brought together under the leadership of the
General Staff.4
Intensive militarisation, sometimes referred to directly as mobilisation, is also
now pervading Russian society, stoked by unending leadership rhetoric of war, confrontation and threat, and blanket military coverage on TV. According to Estonian
Ambassador to the Russian Federation Jüri Luik, the Russian narrative of war is
‘instrumentalising the population and
putting it on a mental war footing’, not
The notion of hybridity meets

Russian narrative of victimhood over
centuries, but also by engendering ‘a
heroic feeling that now is the time of risk’.5 Furthermore, analysis of Russian security
thinking shows not only this asymmetry of threat perception, but also a complete
divergence with the West in terms of notions of how and when the military should
be used to counter those threats.
As so often, there is no single explanation for a given course of action by Russia,
and direct intervention in Crimea and Ukraine has also been parsed as a response
to the threat posed to Russian business interests by closer integration with the
European Union (EU). The EU model of open markets and rules-based dealings
runs directly counter to the Russian way of doing business in the near abroad,
reinforcing the growing Russian perception of the EU as a problem rather than an
opportunity; but few analysts would have predicted that it would be the prospect
of an EU Association Agreement for Ukraine, rather than any involvement with
NATO, which would eventually lead to military intervention by Russia.
The ambivalent attitude to Ukraine as a sovereign nation with a right to choose
its own foreign policy direction has its roots in an entirely different view of the end

of the Soviet Union. That view holds that the former Soviet republics, including
Ukraine and the Baltic States, in effect belong to Russia. According to President
Putin, in 1991 ‘Russia voluntarily – I emphasise – voluntarily and consciously made
absolutely historic concessions in giving up its own territory’.6 This persistent view
is not limited to President Putin. According to veteran scholar of Russia Paul Goble:
‘The Russian elite is sincerely convinced that the preservation of influence
on the former Soviet republics surrounding it is the status quo and a natural right given by history,’ even though ‘for the entire rest of the world
such an approach is incomprehensible and unnatural’.
What this means is that Moscow acts ‘as if the Soviet Union had not fallen apart,
as if it had only been reformatted, but relations between sovereign and vassal have
remained as before’.7 It is plain that at least in some sectors of society, these aspirations by Russia to regain imperial dominion over its surroundings enjoy broad
support. The now-celebrated Prosecutor General of Crimea, Natalya Poklonskaya,
in an interview at the time of annexation declared her ambition to ‘start again in a
great state, a great power, an empire, like Russia’.8

view:
‘Stalin was no more than reasserting Russian authority over territories which
had long recognised Tsarist rule, and which had been torn away from Russia
at the time of her revolutionary weakness after the First World War’.9
The effect of these long-standing assumptions is a mind-set that leads to casual
references by Russian generals to ‘nashi byvshiye strany’ (‘our former countries’),
statements that even Finland and Poland were ‘parts of Russia’, and that all major
powers have a non-threatening sanitary zone (‘sanitarnaya zona’) around them.10
Russia’s attempts to maintain, or reassert, this buffer zone are a major contributor to
the current stand-off.
Since 1991, Moscow has employed a wide range of coercive tools in attempts –

often unsuccessful – to maintain influence and leverage over its Western neighbours.11 From the mid-2000s, Russia benefited from a sudden influx of revenue
thanks to higher oil prices and began to review its perception of its own strengths
accordingly. From the earliest stages, this was reflected in huge budget increases for
the Armed Forces,12 and an intensified pattern of testing levers of influence against
Western neighbours.13 High-profile incidents during this stage included gas cut-offs
for Ukraine in 2006, the crude cyber offensive against Estonia in May 2007, and
ultimately the use of military force against Georgia in 2008. In each case, the results
validated this approach for Russia: the Georgian conflict in particular demonstrated
the validity of use of armed force as a foreign policy tool bringing swift and effective
results, with only limited and temporary economic and reputational costs to bear.
It was in this context that a range of informed analysis pointed to Ukraine as the next
target for assertive Russian action. A UK parliamentary report in 2009 noted that:
‘Many of our witnesses stressed that Russia poses a military threat to
other former Soviet states, particularly in light of its actions in Georgia...
Some witnesses argued that Russia posed a military threat to Ukraine...
one scenario was that Putin could send in military forces to secure the
Russian military base at Sevastopol’.14

Is This Cyber Warfare?

As noted above, the levers of power which Russia is bringing to bear in Ukraine are
wide-ranging. This study looks in detail at the specific cyber conflict aspect of the
Ukraine crisis, but even this concept is impressively broad thanks to the holistic and
inclusive Russian approach to what constitutes information warfare, of which cyber
is an integral part.
Opinions are divided as to whether what is taking place in and around Ukraine
can or should be called cyber war. As Jan Stinissen argues in Chapter 14, current
cyber operations do not meet a strict legal definition of a state of war. But at the
same time, according to one analysis, operations in Ukraine undoubtedly constitute
cyber warfare. The conflict:
‘meets the generally accepted standard for the following reasons: the
cyber warfare component is overt, meaning the perpetrators make little
effort to hide either their identities or their allegiances. The two countries

are in open, hostile and declared conflict with each other. Both sides have
stated military and political objectives’.15
As if to emphasise the point, intensive cyber attacks reportedly cease during the
occasional observance of ceasefires.16
Other elements of the cyber conflict also confound definition. Operations to
date represent an evolution in Russian tactics compared to previous campaigns.
Both cyber and traditional elements of conflict are present, but they are both less
overt and more difficult to understand and defend against.
In part, this is due to Ukraine’s very different cyber terrain. Comparisons to
Russia’s rudimentary cyber efforts at the time of the Georgian conflict in 2008 are
of limited value. Unlike Georgia, Ukraine’s more interconnected nature makes it
impossible to restrict access to the internet overall, except in the very special case of
the Crimean peninsula. But in addition, there is no reason why Russia should try,
especially given the integrated nature of Ukrainian and Russian information space.
Since Russia already enjoyed domination of Ukrainian cyberspace, including telecommunications companies, infrastructure, and overlapping networks, there was
little incentive to disrupt it. In short, Russia had no need to attack that which it
already owned.17 To give one simplistic but indicative example, little offensive cyber
effort is needed for Russia to access sensitive Ukrainian e-mail traffic when so many
Ukrainians, including government officials, use Russian mail services and therefore
provide automatic access to the Russian security and intelligence services.18
A distinctive aspect of information operations in Ukraine itself, and one with
important implications for how cyber war may be waged in future, is the way Russian activity in the cyber domain facilitates broader information warfare aims. This
manifests itself not only in straightforward spearphishing of Ukrainian officials19
for exploitation, but also in specific uses of malware in the conflict.20 A particular example is the redirection of malware originally intended for cybercrime to
manipulating viewer figures to promote pro-Russian video clips.21 But potentially
even more significant for the nature of future cyber operations is the new interface

second, civilian internet infrastructure needs at least as much defence and protection as other strategic assets.
In any case, the course of the conflict so far has seen no visible full-scale cyber
hostilities of the kind envisaged by theorists, a theme examined in more detail by
Martin Libicki in Chapter 5. The tactics, techniques and procedures which have
been used at various stages of the conflict are the subject of two separate detailed
examinations by Nikolay Koval and Glib Pakharenko in Chapters 6 and 7.

Reactions and Responses

Information campaigning, facilitated by cyber activities, contributed powerfully to
Russia’s ability to prosecute operations against Ukraine in the early stages of the conflict with little coordinated opposition from the West. The fact that for almost a year
the EU was unable to refer publicly to the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine23
denotes a broader inability to challenge the Russian version of events without which
a meaningful response is difficult or impossible. Early media coverage of the conflict made it ‘apparent … that some interlocutors had swallowed whole some of the
cruder falsifications of Russian propaganda’.24
As the realisation of the nature of the Russian information campaign began to
filter through Western media and policy-making circles, this gave way to a dangerous optimism about the effectiveness of Russian measures, and a widespread
assumption that Russian disinformation was failing because of its lack of plausibil22

ity. Supposedly, Russian lies were ineffective because they were so obvious that they
did not confuse senior and intelligent individuals in the West. But this was to underestimate the effects of layered messaging, subtlety screened and concealed by more
obvious fabrications, continued saturation, and in particular the pernicious effect
of the ‘filter bubble’ on online reading habits – the way personalised search results
driven by advertising models can effectively isolate internet users from alternative
information and viewpoints.25
Russian official sources continue to disseminate lies which are easily detected
and discredited in the West, as with the striking example of the ‘discovery’ of supposed US MANPADS in Donetsk in late July 2015.26 But the implausibility is irrelevant for Russian objectives: the story has been planted and will continue to be disseminated via the internet, and will not be

readers that the disinformation is true, Russian success is defined in two other ways:
isolating the domestic audience from non-approved information so that Russian
state actions are permissible; and influencing foreign decision making by supplying polluted information, exploiting the fact that Western elected representatives
receive and are sensitive to the same information flows as their voters. When Russian disinformation delivered in this manner is part of the framework for decisions,
this constitutes success for Moscow, because a key element of the long-standing
Soviet and Russian approach of reflexive control is in place.
Crucially, it must be remembered that Russian disinformation campaigns aimed
at the West are conducted not only in NATO languages, but also in Arabic and
Russian targeting minorities across Europe. This itself has major implications for
managing future confrontations between Russia and other front-line states, which
must involve finding a means to respond to Russian information operations when
the initiative necessarily lies with Russia. As put pithily by journalist and author
Peter Pomerantsev, ‘they will always win the narrative war, because they can make
stuff up’.27
For the time being, much of the Western response appears focused on finding a label for the newly-demonstrated Russian way of warfare. A range of early
contenders, such as ‘non-linear war’, ‘ambiguous war’ and others have largely
been abandoned in favour of ‘hybrid warfare’, a concept originally designed for
describing insurgency rather than warfighting by an aspiring regional power, but
now applied to a totally new situation. Nevertheless many of the components now
being used to define hybridity are nothing new in Russian practice. One argument

holds that a previous round of expansionism by Russia in 1939-40 shared sufficient
characteristics with current operations around Ukraine, including intimidation,
spurious legitimation, and information campaigns backed with the prospect of
full-scale invasion, to also be called hybrid warfare.28 Russia’s clinging to the attitudes and approaches of a former age holds other dangers too: Russian military,
and in particular nuclear, messaging is baffling to its Western audience because
the post-nationalist West has moved on from the Cold War mind-set in which it
is rooted. The result is a dangerous situation where the messages from Russia are
received, but not understood.

Outlook

At the time of writing the situation around Ukraine remains fluid and unpredictable.
While Russia shows no signs of pushing for greater territorial control of Ukraine,
moves toward conciliation by the West give rise to fears of appeasement and the
danger of a repeat of the disastrous resolution to the Georgia conflict seven years
before.29 But one undeniable achievement by Russia is the transformation of the
security environment in Central and Eastern Europe. Faced with a challenge that is
no longer deniable, Europe has overcome its ‘strategic inertia’.30 NATO in particular
has been revitalised: the NATO agenda has shifted radically from contemplation of
a future role after withdrawal from Afghanistan, now that the Alliance has a clear
motivation to return to its core purpose. Poland and the Baltic states, long cast as
irresponsible trouble-makers for warning of the implications of a resurgent Russia,
are now fully vindicated and benefiting from the overall NATO and unilateral US
military response to the crisis. Each is at present supporting these front-line states
with very small increments of conventional military forces, while considering how
to respond to the broader threat of a more assertive Russia.31
The Ukraine conflict has the potential to bring about a transformative effect
specifically within cyber doctrine. Unlike Russia, the siloed Western approach to
cyber has typically focused on technical responses to technical threats, largely disregarding the interface with information warfare in the broad sense. This approach is
entirely apt for persistent or background threats, but probably insufficient for when
a national security crisis emerges, since at that point there will be no such thing as
a ‘pure cyber’ confrontation. In other words, the West may have been well prepared

for cyber war, but events in Ukraine show that it also needs to be prepared for information war when cyber operations are used as a facilitator or attack vector.
More broadly, Russia has clearly demonstrated an improved capability to coordinate its levers of state power in order to achieve strategic objectives in contrast
to the West’s apparent deficit of grand strategy. In his chapter ‘Strategic Defence in
Cyberspace: Beyond Tools and Tactics’, Richard Bejtlich calls for strategic thought
in cyber policy, but this approach needs to be mirrored across all domains in order
to successfully counter the broad-based Russian approach to modern warfare.
The crisis around Ukraine has brought Europe closer to recognition that its values and interests are incompatible with those of Russia, and that if the West wishes
to support Russia’s neighbours in asserting their sovereignty and choosing their own
destiny, confrontation with Russia is the

of relative quiescence that were the
exception to the rule. European nations have now been prompted by events to once
more take an interest in their own defence. But while concentrating on countering
and forestalling Russia’s next unacceptable act of force, they must also be prepared
for a sustained period of difficult and expensive tension.33 In Russia’s neighbourhood, the new normal is a return to old ways.

Cyber War and Strategic
Culture: The Russian
Integration of Cyber Power
into Grand Strategy
James J. Wirtz
Naval Postgraduate School

Discussion of the cyber domain in general, and specific considerations of cyber
attacks, cyber war and cyber power, often seem oddly detached from a broader strategic and geopolitical context.1 Several reasons can be suggested for why the cyber
dimension of conflict seems to be considered in isolation from the physical and
political goals that states and non-state actors attempt to achieve through their activities in the virtual world of cyberspace. Offensive and defensive cyber capabilities
are highly classified by all parties; it is impossible to say with certainty what capabilities are wielded, making it difficult to assess ‘cyber orders of battle’ and ‘cyber
balances of power’. Newspaper reports, anecdotes, and rumours of capabilities offer
clues, but it is difficult to link rumours to grand strategic objectives. Cyber warfare
is an exquisitely technical subject dominated by engineers, mathematicians, and
computer scientists – individuals who can be forgiven for focusing on the latest
patch needed in some software program, and for not thinking about the connection
between technical exploitation and grand political strategy. In a sense, issues related
to cyber warfare are often treated, not just as something technically new on the military landscape, but as something that is unprecedented in military affairs.
If one turns a strategist’s eye toward the cyber domain, key questions immediately emerge. How will states integrate their cyber capabilities into an overall strat1

egy to achieve military and political goals? In other words, no matter how brilliant
the algorithm, no matter how devious the penetration, how can cyber power be
integrated into a ‘combined arms’ or even a ‘whole of government’ approach leading
to battlefield success or to a grand strategy that creates a political fait accomPolitical and strategic culture

the ultimate silver bullet in political
and military conflict, it is unlikely to be
employed independently as a war-winning weapon. Moreover, given the need for
integration, issues of political and strategic culture, to say nothing of bureaucratic
preferences and peacetime legal restraints, can be expected to produce national
styles and preferences when it comes to conflict in cyberspace.2
Although attribution of known cyber attacks remains a hotly contested and
much denied issue (given the very limited evidence available), there is some indication that strategic culture and organisational preferences shape the way the
United States, China and Russia use their cyber power. According to press reports,
the United States was behind the Stuxnet malware attack on centrifuges at Iran’s
Natanz enrichment facility.3 Many analysts suggested at the time that the Stuxnet
attack was noteworthy as the first example of the use of a cyber weapon to cause
physical damage, but it also reflected the long-standing American tradition of
long-range precision bombardment and the preference for targeting key nodes in
an opponent’s infrastructure to produce maximum damage with minimal effort.4
By contrast, the recent Office of Personnel Management hack, which press reporting attributes to the People’s Republic of China, seems to reflect a Chinese preoccupation with guarding its own citizens from nefarious outside influences, while
going to great lengths to gather information that is locked behind others’ defensive barriers.5
Russian cyber activities, especially those associated with the recent conflict
in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, probably offer the best example of the
employment of cyber attacks to shape the overall political course of a dispute.
According to David J. Smith:

Russia holds a broad concept of information warfare, which includes
intelligence, counterintelligence, deceit, disinformation, electronic warfare, debilitation of communications, degradation of navigation support,
psychological pressure, degradation of information systems and propaganda. Computers are among the many tools of Russian information
warfare, which is carried out 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in war
and peace. Seen this way, distributed denial of services attacks (DDoS),
advanced exploitation techniques and Russia Today television are all
related tools of information warfare.6
Russia, more than any other nascent actor on the cyber stage, seems to have
devised a way to integrate cyber warfare into a grand strategy capable of achieving
political objectives.

with a brief discussion of Russian strategic culture, especially how it manifested in past debates the impact of technology on

NATO deterrence strategies, effectively delivering a strategic defeat to the alliance at
the outset of its ‘hybrid’ war against Ukraine. The essay concludes by offering some
observations about the strategic nature of cyber warfare.

Russian Strategic Culture and Technology

Often, states or individuals who initially invent or master some new technology fail
to understand, not only its strategic implications, but also how best to employ it in
a tactical or operational setting. Historically, Russia, including its Soviet manifestation, has not been at the forefront of scientific or technical innovation. As one recent
history explained, Soviet Cold War espionage was largely dedicated to stealing scientific, technical, and military information from the West in a desperate and ultimately failed effort to keep pace with more sophisticated and innovative opponents.7
Nevertheless, while the Russians may lack in technological prowess and innovative
drive, they tend to excel in their ability to foresee the broad impact of technology on
the battlespace. Several sources can be suggested as the basis of this talent. As Robert Bathhurst explained decades ago, the Russians tend to be ‘dreamers’, allowing

their imaginations to run wild and envision the implications of technology.8 In the
1920s, for instance, Soviet writers were thinking about supersonic dogfights on the
fringes of space – something that has not occurred nearly a century later. During the
Cold War, visions of a fully functioning Star Wars missile defence system shook the
Kremlin to its foundations, despite the

other words, while America focuses on
issues of technology and systems integration, Russia tends to leap immediately to considerations of the strategic implications
of emerging weapons systems.
A second influence that shapes Russian views of emerging technology is the fact
that, in their hearts, they are good Clausewitzians. In other words, they understand
the paramount nature of politics in war. War is a political act. Its purpose is to alter
the political judgments of opponents to better suit our own interests. Thus, to have
a strategic effect, cyber power must be used in a way that will shape the political
outcome of war. Russians are thus quick to think through the links between technology, military operations, strategy, and ultimately political outcomes, despite their
lack of technological dexterity. Soviet estimates of the military balance, for example,
reflected a broad assessment of the so-called ‘correlation of forces’, which incorporated political and economic trends, not just force ratios based on ‘bean counts’ of
military units. Soviet alarm over NATO’s 1983 Able Archer exercise, for instance,
was greatly influenced by the political rhetoric emanating from the Reagan White
House, not by some fundamental shift in the military balance in Europe. The Russian officer corps, especially in Soviet days, was also encouraged to think through
the strategic implications of new technologies. Today, the Russian Army provides
senior officers with multiple venues to debate not only doctrine, but theory. By contrast, US officers, who tend to focus on operational matters, generally lack similar
venues to assess the strategic and political implications of new technology.9 In fact,
many analysts point to a 2013 article signed by the Chief of the Russian General
Staff, The Value of Science in Anticipating as laying out the Russian way of cyber
warfare.10
A fine illustration of these phenomena is the emergence of the concept of ‘Military-Technical Revolution,’ more commonly referred to by Western analysts as the

‘Revolution in Military Affairs.’11 By the mid-1970s, NATO defence planners recognised that they confronted a serious challenge along the Central Front. If war broke
out in Europe, NATO would do well against first-echelon Warsaw Pact formations,
but the Alliance could only slowly bring reinforcements across the Atlantic. Soviet
third-echelon forces – units made up mostly of inactive reservists in peacetime –
would probably defeat NATO because they would reach the battle before reinforcements streaming across the Atlantic. The United States and its allies had to prevent the
third-echelon of the Red Army from reaching the Forward Edge of the Battle Area
(FEBA). The solution to the third-echelon threat was found in several new technologies that would allow NATO to conduct precision strikes against Warsaw Pact staging areas, depots, transportation hubs, and armoured formations hundreds of miles
behind the FEBA. By the mid-1980s, US programmes known as Assault Breaker and
Smart Weapons Program, and NATO initiatives called Emerging Technologies and
Follow on Forces Attack, were integrated into a new US Army Air-Land Battle doctrine, creating a nascent reconnaissance-strike complex. US planners adopted a rather
nonstrategic and apolitical view of these new technologies – they simply saw them as
a way to stop Soviet third-echelon forces from reaching the Central Front.
By contrast, the Soviets now anticipated a ‘Military-Technical Revolution’, predicting that the emerging reconnaissance-strike complex would transform conventional combat, producing truly strategic and political effects. Soviet strategists
believed that long-range precision strikes could destroy forces and critical supply,
communication, and command nodes deep within the enemy’s rear, creating conditions for a catastrophic theatre-wide collapse. Put somewhat differently, the system of systems possessed by the Americans and their NATO allies would rob the
Warsaw Pact of its ability to mass and manoeuvre forces, or even to conduct combined arms operations. Soviet officers estimated that the nature of war was about
to change: conventional, not nuclear, munitions might soon become the weapon of
choice against massed armoured and infantry formations. They saw the potential
impact that this emerging system of systems could have on strategy, war, and international politics; there was a real possibility that the Warsaw Pact could be rendered
militarily and politically ineffective by these emerging weapons and ways of war.
Ironically, Soviet predictions of a Military-Technical Revolution set off alarm
bells in the West, as analysts scrambled to detect the new secret Soviet weapon that
would produce these revolutionary developments in war. Americans were slow
to realise that the Soviets were in fact writing about American weapons, and the
nascent precision-strike complex, which was in fact possessed exclusively by the
United States and the NATO alliance. As a result, many of the key concepts related
to the application of information-age technologies in warfare were produced by
Soviets thinking about the weapons systems being deployed by their opponents,
and not by the more technically competent Americans.

Russian Cyber Strategy

Today, how is this Clausewitzian-inspired Russian strategic imagination being
applied to the use of cyber power? The answer can be found by first exploring the
strategic challenge they apparently believe they face: the NATO alliance. NATO is
based on the concept of collective defence that enhances its strategy of deterrence.
Through formal agreements and long-standing and extensive collaboration, NATO
sends a strong signal that member states will stand together in the face of threats
to collectively deter aggression against its members. The objective of this deterrent
policy is to preserve the peace. This is a key observation. The goal of NATO’s deterrent strategy is to reduce or even eliminate the possibility of war by ensuring that
aggressors understand ex ante that an attack against one of its members is an attack
against the entire Alliance. Especially today, NATO primarily exists to prevent war,
not to develop enhanced strategies or capabilities to prosecute war or to wield forces
to achieve ancillary objectives. In a sense, NATO exists to preserve the peace and
to make sure that changes to the status quo in Europe occur through political processes that lead to the spread of democracy, the rule of law, and adherence to international norms. The raison d’être of NATO is to preserve the peace; the purpose
behind its strategy is to deter war.
To achieve its objective – rapid change of the European status quo to better
fit their Russia-centric, not democratically-cantered, interests and preferences –
Russia opted to pick a course of action not to defeat NATO, but to defeat NATO’s
strategy. By presenting the Western alliance with a fait accompli through actions
that produce minimal death and destruction, Russia attempted to shift the onus of
escalation onto NATO, thereby inflicting a strategic defeat on the Alliance

to the status quo. Russia is banking
on the hope that NATO will either be
incapable or unwilling to transform this strategic defeat into active conventional
combat, which would further undermine NATO’s goal of preserving the peace.
In effect, the Russians seem to have realised that by defeating NATO’s strategy at
the outset of a confrontation, they can actually alter political perceptions within
the Alliance in a way that suits their objectives. Put somewhat differently, the
risk of a forceful NATO response to some provocation is minimised by keeping the death and destruction associated with any fait accompli to an absolute
minimum. NATO is especially vulnerable to cyberattacks and information warfare because Russia can undermine NATO’s deterrent strategy without causing
casualties. NATO has the option of reversing the fait accompli, but the required
level of death and destruction simply highlights the failure of its deterrent
strategy.

34

Cyber power, as a key facet of hybrid warfare, is an important enabler in an
attack on NATO’s deterrent strategy.12 Cyber attacks are not specifically targeted
to eliminate key nodes, but to intensify the fog of war by sowing confusion within
command and control networks and
NATO polities. For instance, according

iad cyber attacks, including Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) tactics against
computers in Kyiv, Poland, the European Parliament, and the European Commission.13 If local political and military leaders cannot develop an accurate estimate
of quickly developing events, critical hours or even days can be gained with which
Russia can create facts on the ground that can only be reversed at great effort. A little
bit of ‘sand in the works’, so to speak, is enough to further delay the relatively slowpace of decision-making in the West.14
The annexation of Crimea also began with a series of covert operations that used
a disinformation campaign to create ambiguity and delay Ukraine’s response, effectively extending the element of surprise achieved by the Russian gambit. According
to Michael Kofman and Matthew Rohansky:
‘Russia’s use of broadcast tools for propaganda and psychological operations,
part of a broader information campaign to support the Crimean annexation,
caught both the Ukraine and the West by surprise. Moscow amped up the
alarmist content of its broadcasting . . . stoking fear and confusion in Crimea’.15
Admittedly, the annexation was completed using more traditional operations
involving conventional units, but the cyber-enabled opening moves not only
allowed Russia to test the Western response, but to buy the time needed to create a
fait accompli through conventional means.
Western analysts have noted that even though the Crimea crisis surprised the
West, the Russian effort to integrate television and the internet, especially various

As Michael Kofman and Matthew Rojansky note, ‘hybrid warfare,’ including the Russian variations used against the Ukraine
is not unique. The point here, however, is that Russia is particularly adept as using cyber power in the practice of hybrid warfare; see Kofman and Rojansky, (op cit) p. 2. Other analysts have noted how the Crimea annexation and the additional actions
against Ukraine were dependant on capabilities long under development that were especially crafted not to trigger a NATO
response; Aleksandr Golts and Heidi Reisinger. ‘Russia’s Hybrid Warfare: Waging War below the Radar of Traditional Collective Defence,’ Research Paper No 105 (Research Division – NATO Defence College Rome) November 2014.

The key point is that information denial or dominance does not have to be absolute, it just needs to foster delay and uncertainty in Western political and military decision-making. According to Paul Saunders, ‘Russia’s seizure of Crimea happened
very quickly. U.S. and European decision-making processes just don’t move at that speed, particularly when facing ambiguity.
Once a Crimea-style operation has begun, it will be extremely difficult if not impossible for Western decision-makers to be

types of social media, into its effort to shape opponents’ political perspectives, has
been ongoing for quite some time. In a sense, Russia has worked hard to use the
internet to shape the political environment of conflict: it has (1) developed internally and externally focused media with a significant online presence; (2) used
social media to guarantee that Russian narratives reach the broadest possible audience; and (3) polished their content in terms of language and presentation so that
it rings true in various cultural settings.16 These activities have recently been given
their own moniker – trolling – the practice of creating cyber actors with false identities to communicate tailored messages to an unsuspecting audience.17 According
to Keir Giles:
‘Russian assessments of current events makes it clear that Russia considers itself
to be engaged in full-scale information warfare, involving not only offensive
but defensive operations – whether or not its notional adversaries have actually
noticed this is happening’.18
What most analysts fail to realise, however, is that Moscow has shaped this
cyber-enabled information warfare in a very strategic manner. Cyber power is being
wielded as a strategic weapon to create facts on the ground with the minimal use of
kinetic force.

3

Conclusion

Because of its rather inchoate nature, the cyber domain is a milieu in which various strategic cultures can be manifest. Russian strategic culture focuses on war as a
political activity; for cyber power to have a truly strategic effect, Russia believes that
it must contribute directly to shaping political outcomes by altering the political
perceptions of their opponents to better suit their interests. If one also accepts the
idea that Russians are especially adept at understanding the political and strategic
impact of new technologies, it is possible that they have grasped the real strategic
opportunities created by the information revolution – opportunities that might be
given short shrift by analysts shaped by different strategic cultures.
The true test of strategy, however, is found in a specific geopolitical and military
context. In terms of Crimea and Ukraine, the Russians have developed an exquisite
strategic application of cyber power not to defeat NATO’s military capabilities, but
to defeat NATO’s strategy by creating a fait accompli while sidestepping NATO’s
deterrent. By using cyber power to create ‘facts on the ground’ with minimal casual16

ties, they shifted the onus of escalation onto NATO to reverse the fait accompli. In a
sense, they created a situation in which NATO leaders must choose between suffering a harsh strategic defeat (the eruption of war in Europe) and the accommodation
of the Russian annexation of Crimea and ongoing pressure against Ukraine. Cyber
power, either in the form of direct attacks or a concerted information campaign, was
used to create this dilemma for NATO by delaying a Western response until these
stark choices emerged. The lesson is clear: if one can defeat an opponent’s strategy,
then it is possible to achieve one’s objectives without defeating an opponent’s forces
or triggering execution of a deterrent threat.

to Our Will’: The Role of
Cyber Warfare in Ukraine

Metric for Cyber Attack

The conflict in Ukraine has challenged fundamental elements of Western alliance
strategy. Russian efforts exploit a general reluctance by the West – natural in democracies – to risk war. The West has been unable to deter Russia from its adventure.
Cyber warfare has played only a limited role in this. The concepts of strategic and
military effect provide us with two metrics for assessing the effect of cyber attacks generally, and for Russian cyber activities in Ukraine. Strategic effect would be to diminish the opponent’s will or capacity to resist. This can include politically coercive cyber
actions such as were used against Estonia. Military effect would be degradation in the
performance of commanders, troops, and weapons, demonstrated by U.S. actions in
its Middle Eastern conflicts or as part of the 2007 Israeli airstrike in Syria1.
Cyber attacks that produce strategic or military effect can include the manipulation of software, data, knowledge, and opinion to degrade performance and produce
political or psychological effect. Introducing uncertainty into the minds of opposing
commanders or political leaders is a worthy military objective. Manipulating public
opinion to damage an opponent’s legitimacy and authority in both domestic and
international audiences is also valuable. Some actions may provide only symbolic
effect aimed at a domestic audience, but this too is valuable for a nation in conflict.

39

To assess non-kinetic effect as a contributor for strategic or military advantage, we must look for observable effects in three categories: creating confusion,
shaping opinion, and inflicting damage to data or services. Using these metrics,
we can conclude that Russian cyber efforts in Ukraine produced an early tactical
effect that has since tapered off and, since they are limited to actions that do not
produce physical or disruptive consequences, have largely failed to achieve strategic or military effect.

Strategic and Military Effect

The Ukraine conflict has been described as hybrid warfare; a mixture of unconventional tactics and strategies, irregular forces, covert action, cyber operations, and
political manipulation to achieve strategic goals. In essence, hybrid warfare is a collection of tactics designed to circumvent deterrence and avoid military retaliation
by skirting the threshold of what could be considered state use of armed force. In
this new style of conflict, non-kinetic actions can be as important as kinetic attacks.
Hybrid warfare highlights the central problem for our understanding and management of interstate conflict; conventional warfare is now only part of a larger range of
coercive actions available to nations.
Cyber operations – the ability to remotely manipulate computer networks – have
created a capability that is well suited
to this new political-military environCyber capabilities create an

law which cyber war inhabits, and
where opponents can find it difficult to
respond. Advanced cyber action can create physical effects equivalent to kinetic
attack, but we should not interpret cyber capabilities solely from the perspective of
physical effect.
While cyber attacks can produce effects similar to kinetic weapons, there is an
informational aspect involving the manipulation of opinion and decision-making
that is equally important and much more frequently used. Cyber attack can produce results equivalent to kinetic attack, but this is not its primary effect, which
(at least for now) is to manipulate data, knowledge, and opinion to produce political or psychological effect rather than physical damage. Introducing uncertainty
into the minds of opposing commanders or political leaders is a worthwhile military goal, as it will cause them to make mistakes or to become hesitant, providing
the attacker with dominance of the battle space and the advantage of putting the
defender in a reactive posture. Cyber actions that manipulate public opinion to
40

affect an opponent’s legitimacy and authority are also valuable in conflict among
states.
Cyber attack creates an operational space for coercive action that avoids many
of the political risks of kinetic warfare. Cyber attacks are attractive in that they offer
varying degrees of covertness and their treatment under international law remains
ambiguous in regard to whether they qualify as an ‘armed attack’ that would legitimise retaliation. Although cyber tools and techniques can be used in harmful ways,
they are not weapons per se, which can make it difficult to decide when a cyber
incident can be considered an armed attack or a use of force.
An initial effort to define how a cyber incident could qualify as a use of force
or armed attack would be to consider that an effect of the cyber action was the
equivalent of an attack using conventional weapons producing physical destruction or casualties. A cyber incident that produced injury or death to persons
and the destruction of or damage to property would certainly be considered as
a use of force or armed attack. A cyber attack that produced intangible effects
of such scope, intensity, and duration that they are judged to have consequences
or harmful effects of sufficient scale and gravity could also be considered an
armed attack.
No Russian action in Ukraine rises to this level. Overall, the use of offensive
cyber capabilities for kinetic effect has been minimal, with only a few known incidents. Russia is one of the most skilled among the nations who have developed
cyber capabilities, but we have not seen extensive use of actual attacks against
Ukraine. Neither critical infrastructure nor Ukrainian weapons have been damaged
or disrupted. Russia has used its cyber capabilities primarily for political coercion,
opinion-shaping, and intelligence gathering, and these cyber operations fall below
the threshold set in Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. Operations in Estonia,
Georgia, and now Ukraine suggest that NATO may need to adjust its thinking about
how opponents will use cyber attacks.
Russia has been relatively careful in the overt use of its own forces – especially
compared to its actions against Georgia where the Russian Ministry of Defence confirmed that Russian armoured units were engaged in combat for ‘peace enforcement’. The Russian army occupied Georgian territory and Russian aircraft bombed
targets including the capital.2 Russian actions in Ukraine took a different course.
The current caution may reflect lessons learned in Georgia or a desire to preserve
some degree of deniability, and manoeuvring to avoid an overt violation of international law.
Cyber attack does not require ‘an act of violence to compel our opponent to
fulfil our will’.3 Violence through cyber means is possible, but that is not the only
or even primary use of cyber attack. Its effects are more often intangible and

informational, and are intended to manipulate data, create uncertainty, and shape
opinion. An emphasis on kinetic effect can obscure important operational distinctions in the use of cyber techniques and complicates efforts to develop norms
for cyber conflict.

Norms and the Application of International Law4

Russia’s activities in Ukraine have implications for both cyber warfare and for cyber
norms. Russian actions have carved new contours for conflict that do not map perfectly to existing concepts and rules for warfare and defence. Existing norms and
laws for armed attack were based on the use or threat of use of physical violence and
force. These must be adjusted, if not amended, for cyber conflict.
Efforts to redefine violence and force to include the full range of possible
cyber actions (such as Russian and Chinese efforts in the United Nations (UN)
to define information as a weapon5) have so far introduced more ambiguity
than clarity. Information is clearly not a weapon, but a minimalist definition
that emphasises kinetic effect is also inadequate in capturing the full range of
cyber effects.
As such, the ‘rules’ for cyber conflict

ing to note that with the 2015 Group of
Governmental Experts (GGE), which was
tasked to look at the application of international law to cyber conflict,6 this topic
proved to be the most difficult. Disagreements over the application of international
law between Russia, China and a few others on one hand, and NATO nations on the
other, almost derailed the talks.
The crux of the disagreement was over the application of specific provisions
of the UN Charter, (the general applicability of the Charter had been agreed to
in earlier GGEs), and in particular the applicability of Article 2/4 (renouncing
the use of force) and Article 51 (the inherent right to self-defence). One question for the development of further norms for cyber conflict becomes whether
it is possible to move beyond the norms embedded in the UN Charter and the
international agreements governing the conduct of warfare and armed conflict,
to address this new aspect of warfare and to create norms that govern non-ki4

netic action. One possible avenue for progress would be to expand the Charter
commitment to avoid actions that threaten the territorial integrity or political
independence of a state (found in Articles 2/4 and 51) to explicitly include cyber
actions.
Continued ambiguity over the application of these UN Charter articles serves
the interests of Russia and China by not creating grounds for or legitimising retaliation for cyber actions.7 This includes a general rejection of Western efforts to define
‘use of force’ and ‘armed attack’ using the concepts of equivalence and effect. These
ambiguities, however, are not unique to cyber conflict, date from the signing of the
Charter, and reflect conflicting desires to renounce the use of force while preserving
the right to use force in self-defence. The Russian and Chinese goal, similar to other
actions in arms control negotiations by these countries, is to constrain the U.S. and
its allies.
Intentional ambiguity may define the emerging strategic conflict between Russia
and the West for the foreseeable future. Russian cyber tactics accentuate and expand
ambiguity. The Russian concept of cyber warfare blends elements of what would
be considered information warfare in the West. It is well known that the Russians
prefer to use the phrase ‘information conflict’ to ‘cyber conflict’ on the grounds that
cyber is too narrow and technical. Unsurprisingly, this preference reflects their use
and understanding of cyber techniques.
The norms before the UN General Assembly for approval at its 70th session will
reiterate the rule of international law and the UN Charter, although how these are
to be applied is a matter of intense dispute. They call for states not to attack critical
infrastructure in peacetime, and to take note of the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality, and distinction whey they exercise their inherent rights recognised by the UN Charter, including the right of self-defence. They do not address
the use of cyber tools for political coercion, and it is interesting and indicative to
note that Russia, which has made the most frequent use of cyber coercion, is the
leading proponent for such norms.
State practice suggests that there is an implicit threshold among states to avoid
cyber actions against each other that could be interpreted as the use of force or
an armed attack. This creates implicit norms for state behaviour derived from
international practice that constrain malicious cyber actions, but these implicit
norms are inadequate for this new form of conflict. The kind of cyber conflict
we have seen in Ukraine poses a challenge not only to existing Western strategy
(which is based on international law and UN Charter commitments) but also for
the development of norms. If the trend in warfare is to circumvent direct confrontation between conventional forces (particularly the conventional forces of
the U.S. and its allies), and if cyber conflict will often not involve kinetic effect
or territorial intrusions, existing norms and rules for conflict will have limited
application.
7

According to conversations between the author and GGE representatives from many countries.

43

We can place cyber norms into four categories:
• Those that call for observation of existing international law regarding
state responsibility, especially the laws of armed conflict;
• Those that seek to exempt from cyber attack infrastructures where an
attack could have an indiscriminate effect such as critical infrastructures, including the infrastructure of the global internet;
• Norms on state responsibilities to assist other states that are the victim
of cyber attacks; and
• Norms on the proliferation of cyber technologies that could be used
for malevolent purposes (which is still nascent and suffers from definitional problems).
None of these norms can be easily extended to the new modes of coercion created
by cyber capabilities. The stricture that comes closest is the Article 2/4 commitment
to refrain from the use of force against the political independence of another state, but
cyber actions such as we have seen in Ukraine cannot be considered a use of force.
Cyber actions that do not have physical effect and which are taken outside the context of formal conflict do not fit well with the existing structure of international practice.
Nations appear to observe an implicit threshold for their use of cyber tools and with very
few exceptions, have avoided actions that could be considered under international law
as a use of force or an armed attack. Attempts to expand these implicit understandings

eral countries would happily support a norm
that restricts access to information.
Russia, in particular, is quick to label any criticism of its behaviour as disinformation, information warfare, or propaganda. Russian negotiating behaviour, shaped in
good measure by Soviet precedent, is often defensive, seeking to constrain the U.S.
and its allies in areas where the West has a technological advantage, or to limit the
political risks the internet creates. This defensive orientation creates a negotiating
agenda that conflicts with Western countries when it comes to norms.

Comparing Ukraine to Estonia and Georgia

Contrasting Russian cyber activities in Ukraine with Estonia and Georgia is helpful
in assessing their use and value, as well as in considering what new norms might
look like. The cyber attacks in Estonia8, composed of service disruptions and denial

of service incidents, could best be compared to the online equivalent of a noisy protest in front of government buildings and banks. They had little tangible effect, but
they created uncertainty and fear among Estonian leaders as they were considered a
potential precursor to armed Russian intervention. In Georgia9, cyber attacks were
closely coordinated with Russian military operations.
The effects of the cyber attacks in Estonia and Georgia deserve more careful
study. The attacks did not cripple or bring Estonia to its knees, and NATO’s decision
not to invoke Article V reflects this fact. They were frightening not because of the
cyber effect, but because of Estonian concerns about Russian intentions, NATO’s
reliability, and their internal Russian-speaking minority. Similarly, cyber attacks on
Georgia were largely symbolic. The most visible incident was the defacement of the
Georgian President’s website by Russian hackers, who drew moustaches on his photograph. The most interesting part of the Georgia episode was the close operational
coordination between the hackers and the Russian military. The Russians continue
to experiment with cyber tools to support their political objectives.
If the Russian goal in Ukraine is to shape global public opinion, there were some
early successes in painting the Ukrainians as ‘fascists’ (a favoured communist insult)
guilty of human rights violations. But no one believes that anymore, and the tide
of public opinion has turned heavily against Russia. A recent Pew Research survey
on global opinion captures the change and is
entitled ‘Russia, Putin, Held in Low Esteem

Stuxnet) makes Russian cyber operations annoying, but ultimately inconsequential.
The most successful Russian tactics were creating or supporting pro-Russian
separatist groups in areas with significant Russian-speaking minorities and then
using Russian special and ultimately conventional forces to stiffen and protect these
groups from the Ukrainian response. Cyber attack was largely irrelevant.

Both Western and Russian analysts may have drawn the wrong lessons from
Estonia and Georgia. States (especially states with a fondness for Lenin) will use
cyber attacks for politically coercive purposes and might use them for military
purposes, to disrupt data or services. But the incidents in Ukraine did not disrupt
command and control, deny access to information, or have any noticeable military
effect.
This means that we (and the Russians) may overestimate the coercive effect of
cyber attacks and that their real military value is achieved when there is physical
effect or disruption of data and critical services, something that most denial of service attacks cannot produce. Cyber attacks are a support weapon and will shape
the battlefield, but by themselves they will not produce victory. Cyber attacks support other weapons and operations, as in the 2007 Israeli attack against Syrian air
defence. This is still a subject of intense debate, but experience suggests that it is
easy to exaggerate the effect of cyber attack. A more accurate assessment would rank
cyber activities into three categories: espionage, operational, and political. However,
note that the benefits of the former are clear, while the latter are open to question.
To provide strategic or military effect, cyber actions must produce destructive
effect and be integrated into existing military structures, doctrine, planning, and
operations. Estonia and Georgia can be contrasted with two known attacks that did
have military effect. The Israeli air strike against a Syrian nuclear facility is reported
to have used cyber means to disrupt

was disrupted. With Stuxnet, there was
physical damage, albeit inflicted covertly, that could be duplicated in overt warfare,
noting that a degree of caution is warranted to predict the effect of cyber attacks on
civilian infrastructure.14 We should also note the reported use of cyber techniques
by the U.S. to disrupt or confuse Taliban command and control, often with lethal
results for the insurgents.15 If cyber is the weaponisation of signals intelligence, it
appears that to have actual military effect, there must be physical damage.
This is a consideration of cyber as a tool of military action and does not consider
either traditional methods of electronic warfare, which Russia has used extensively
in Ukraine,16 nor the intelligence value of Russian cyber espionage. We do not know
the role cyber espionage played in these efforts, but if Russian successes against the
United States are any guide, we can assume cyber spying made a positive contribu13

tion. That Russia has completely penetrated Ukrainian communication networks
and has unparalleled access to Ukrainian communications is likely to provide considerable value for Russian tactics and planning, but cyber as a tool of coercion has
proven to be of limited utility.
This is certainly not the cyber war as it is often depicted in public media, but
it does not mean that cyber attack is overrated and militaries can deemphasise it.
That would be a rash conclusion. It means that the Russians, for whatever reason,
chose not to use the most damaging forms of cyber attack against Ukraine, Georgia,
or Estonia. If allegations that Russia were responsible for damaging cyber attacks
on a German steel mill17 and a Turkish pipeline18 are correct, these would demonstrate that Russia has the capability necessary for cyber attacks that would create
physical damage and qualify as a use of force. Russia’s 2008 exploit in penetrating
Central Command’s classified networks19 was an early demonstration of its ability
to implant malware on an opponent’s networks that could erase data and disrupt
command and control, but the Russians chose not to do this.
In Ukraine, Russia has experimented with how best to produce military and
political benefits from cyber operations. Political context and alliance relationships
have a powerful influence in constraining the use of force, including cyber attacks.
Its cyber actions appear to reflect a decision not to engage the full range of Russian
cyber capabilities. Other potential opponents, including NATO, should not assume
that in the event of conflict, the Russians will make the same decision.

Introduction: Isn’t It Time for Cyber War?

For the last twenty years, with the advent of serious thinking about ‘cyber war’, most
analysts – and even the more sceptical thinkers – have been convinced that all future
kinetic wars between modern countries would have a clear cyber component. However, the current Russo-Ukrainian conflict is challenging this widely held notion.
Coinciding with this assumption, however, it must be said that within the past
generation there have been few conflicts in which both sides appeared both capable of and vulnerable to cyber attack. Either one party to the conflict – usually the
United States – held all the cyber cards, or neither did. For cyber war to take place,
at least one side must have enough digitised networked equipment to make

ing digital weapons because the other
side simply lacked appropriate targets.
Many analysts have speculated that the US, and now other highly networked societies, may hesitate to use cyber tactics because of their own inherent vulnerabilities
in this domain.
Apart from Stuxnet, the most frequently cited example of cyber war in action
came during an alleged Israel Air Force strike against Syrian nuclear facilities in
2007. Integrated air-defence systems (IADS) have been considered ripe targets for

49

cyber warfare, but it was understood that there would be a cost-benefit analysis
relative to dispatching them using more familiar tools such as electronic warfare or
missiles. There were rumours, for example, that the US employed cyberwar techniques against Serbian IADS in 1999, but these rumours were never substantiated.
Even the Syrian story may be a fairy tale, as the details are classified and subject to
much speculation. It is possible that the tactics were in fact more conventional, such
as traditional jamming.1

Unique Aspects of the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict

The current Russo-Ukrainian conflict, however, is a different case, and it should
help us to understand if cyber war is, in 2015, more myth or reality. According to
the prevailing assumption, this war should have seen serious and open cyber war
strategies and tactics. Both countries have technologically advanced societies and
weaponry that at least came up to 1990 standards of modernity. Both countries have
a strong information technology (IT) base, and hackers a-plenty, although many
of them are engaged in organised crime rather than working for the state.2 Russia’s
state-sponsored hackers are widely believed to be on par with, or very close to, NSAlevel standards.
The most notable thing about the war in Ukraine, however, is the near-complete absence of any perceptible cyber war. There has been vigorous cyber espionage,3 the targeting of cell phones by Russian electronic warfare, and the use
of old-fashioned bolt-cutters to sever lines of communication in Crimea.4
Patriotic hacktivists on both sides have conducted harassing but small cyber
attacks against each other,5 both sides have conducted Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks (e.g., by Russia against Ukraine’s parliament),6 and

a (fruitless) campaign to corrupt voting processes in Ukraine.7 However, we
have seen nothing comparable to the cyber attacks carried out against Estonia
in 2007 or Georgia in 2008.
On the other hand, the information and propaganda war in the social media
domain (particularly from the Russian side) has been relentless. In this regard, Moscow has a competitive advantage over Kyiv. The two countries share a common language, Russian (the use of the Ukrainian language is growing fast, but that language
is Slavic), and most Russian-language-friendly sites such as VKontakte (the Russian
Facebook) are headquartered in Russia. That said, little if any of the conflict taking
place in social media requires subverting computers through the discovery of vulnerabilities or the engagement of exploits.
In particular, there are two major forms of cyber attack that have not taken place
in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict: attacks on critical infrastructure and attacks on
defence systems. It is possible that, in the
future, we may learn that there have been

centrifuges failing at unexpected rates,

why. Successful cyber attacks could indefinitely be ascribed to incompetent management before a complete picture is understood. And as for military systems, credible stories of their successful attacks may emerge years later, when people are freer
to talk about what happened in the war.
Even with all of that in mind, in the Internet era it has become difficult to keep
secrets for long periods of time, and the growing absence of cyber attack evidence is
turning into the evidence of absence.

Possible Reasons for the Absence of Cyber Conflict

So, based on what we know now, why has this kinetic conflict seen so little cyber
conflict? Here are some possible answers to that question.
Ukraine does not have the requisite hackers. Russian hackers need no introduction. They work for the state, for cyber crime syndicates, and for themselves as patriotic hacktivist defenders of Mother Russia. However, on the Ukrainian side (a much
smaller nation to begin with), it is possible that a large percentage of the hacker
talent is of Russian descent and may have divided loyalties in this conflict. That said,

many small countries have made large contributions in cyberspace, including Estonia, Iceland, Lebanon8 and Israel.
Neither Russia nor Ukraine has valid targets. This gets closer to the truth.
Although the Soviet Union of 1990 had sophisticated weapons, their long suits were
in metallurgy and radio-frequency devices. When the Soviet Union collapsed, it
was significantly behind the West in terms of electronics and software. In the last
five years, there has been a modest recapitalisation in Russia, but close to none in
Ukraine. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has for the most part
maintained its substantial lead over Russia in digitisation and networking. Thus,
US fears about its systems falling prey to hackers are currently not shared by the
majority of nation-states, who feel that they are not particularly vulnerable. However, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle: for example, no one is buying
analogue telecommunications systems anymore, not even in the developing world.
New equipment is digital and networked, not only because it is more powerful, but
because it is cheaper over the long run. Therefore, even in Russia and Ukraine, the
level of digitisation is likely high enough to engender real concerns about their societies’ vulnerability to cyber attack. Their militaries may be antiquated, but due to the
close relationship between the IT of modern civilian and military domains, there is
probably still plenty for hackers to target.
There is no need – The Russians already own Ukraine: Much of Ukraine’s infrastructure – notably the phone system – dates from the Soviet era. It is logical, therefore, that the Russians have already wired the phone system for interception and, it
would hardly be in their interest to take it down.9 This explanation does not explain
anything the Ukrainian side has or has not done, nor does it explain the lack of
attacks on other systems such as power, natural gas distribution or finance. However, it may help to understand a lack of attacks on telecommunications, given that a
cyber attack could disrupt a lucrative cyber espionage operation by alerting defenders that their systems have been penetrated and forcing a system scrub. Such action
may not only knock out existing implants but also make the reinsertion of malware
more difficult. The effects of cyber attack tend to be short term, while stealthy cyber
exploitation can persist for years. Therefore, for strategic purposes, attacks such as
Denial-of-Service (DoS) can be counterproductive. Well-designed technologies like
Skype, however, which have end-to-end encryption, could lessen the value of cyber
espionage over time (but not by much, because encryption does not protect if computers on one or both ends of the conversation are compromised), and increase the
likelihood of denial-of-service attacks.
Neither Russia nor Ukraine wants such an escalation: In theory, the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is not a war between two states, but an insurgency and count8

er-insurgency campaign over territory in eastern Ukraine. According to the Russian
Government, Russian forces are not even in the fight, and thus far, neither country’s
infrastructure (outside the battle zone) has been touched. In this context, if Russia
were to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure or vice versa it would be hard to ascribe the
attack to separatists, who likely would not possess the requisite advanced hacker
skills among their ‘patriotic hacker’ ranks. Organised crime syndicates may have the
technical expertise, but may lack the trust or the intelligence-informed approach
required. Still, given that both of these groups enjoy some state protection in Russia,
such an operation is not out of the question. The more important point here is that
any such escalation could change the narrative of the conflict from an inter-ethnic squabble to an interstate war. An obvious attack by Russia against Ukraine’s
infrastructure may conflict with its current political narrative. A Ukrainian attack
against Russia could be a warning signal to Moscow that it will have to pay a price
for its actions (a sporty move indeed), as well as a sign that it cannot do better in
a conventional fight with the Russian military. A wild card here is that cyber war
techniques in 2015 may be viewed in and of themselves as unduly escalatory, but
this fear likely does not apply to cyber attacks precisely focused on enemy military
targets in theatre where their use ought to seem no more alarming than the use of,
say, electronic warfare. Finally, it is important to remember that two nuclear states
may easily prefer fighting without resorting to nuclear weapons; in cyber warfare,
many analysts have noted that any two sides are likely riddled with exploitable vulnerabilities.10
Cyber war is not a ‘silver bullet’. Proponents of cyber war argue that attacks are
cheap, asymmetric, effective, and risk-free. But what if they are wrong? A truly successful cyber attack – one that does more than simply annoy defenders – is harder
than it looks. Penetrating systems without getting caught requires technical expertise that is in short supply. Preoperational reconnaissance and intelligence

easy access and manipulation. Human-in-the-loop safeguards, for example, may
prevent truly serious damage from occurring except on rare occasions. Both crit10

ical infrastructure and combat systems are designed to operate under a great deal
of stress and unexpected events. Some states may already have calculated that the
effects of cyber war are limited, temporary, and hard to repeat. Attackers also fear
that digital weapons may work only once before defenders can plug the necessary
holes. In this light, is developing a cyber war arsenal really worth it?

Conclusion

In 1972, when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai was asked about the significance of
the French Revolution of 1789, he famously said, ‘It is too soon to say’.11 With
that logic in mind, it must be noted that the Internet is still a baby, and that cyber
attacks are still in a nascent stage. Despite the prevailing 25 May 2015 ceasefire,
the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is not over. Currently, it could be that neither side
wants to escalate this somewhat localised conflict into the realm of interstate war,
and this may inhibit operations otherwise warranted in less opaque circumstances.
Both parties to the conflict are still exploring their best options, and both are surely
upgrading their traditional and digital military arsenals. Finally, it is hard to say
what current cyber operations may come to light in the future. However, in mid2015, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the easy assumption that cyber
attacks would unquestionably be used in modern warfare has come up wanting.

Introduction: Cyber Conflict in Ukraine

During Ukraine’s revolution in 2014, I served our country as the chief of its Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA).1 During my tenure, we responded to
a wide variety of network security incidents. I can say with great confidence that the
number and severity of cyber attacks against Ukraine rose in parallel with ongoing
political events.
Before the revolution, Ukraine

came in retaliation for unpopular government initiatives, such as when the
authorities tried to shut down the file-sharing website www.ex.ua. By the end of
2012, some of the public’s frustration was channelled into politically motivated website ‘defacements’ (i.e. digital graffiti) within the government’s Internet Protocol (IP)
space.
In 2013, we began to discover a much more serious class of malware. Network
vandalism had given way to a surge in cyber espionage, for which commercial cyber
security companies developed a list of colourful names: RedOctober, MiniDuke,
NetTraveler, and many more.

CERT-UA lies within the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine.
In other words, the botnets were large enough that no other amplification was needed.

55

Once the revolution began in February 2014, even ordinary Ukrainians became
familiar with the combination of hacking and political activism, or ‘hacktivism’,
in which the attackers seek to wage psychological war via the internet. Although
many people were exhausted by the momentous political events that had shaken
our country, it was hard to ignore the publication of allegedly leaked Ukrainian
government documents detailing a secret, fascist government agenda. The most
prominent hacktivist group was CyberBerkut,3 and it is their most famous attack
which is detailed below.
In the course of so many incident responses we learned that, with sufficient evidence, it is usually possible to understand the general nature of an attack, including
who the attackers might be and what they were seeking. Timing, context, victim
identity, and malware sophistication are good indicators. Cutting-edge spyware is
likely to be found on the computers of senior government officials or on important
network nodes within national critical infrastructure. For example, in one case, we
wondered why a private sector executive had been hit, and then discovered that he
had previously been a high-ranking government official.
In my opinion, CERT-UA – in collaboration with network security firms such as
Kaspersky Lab, Symantec, ESET, and others – was usually able to detect, isolate, and
eliminate serious threats to network security in Ukraine.
However, in the course of our work, we also discovered another problem that
any enterprise today should seek to address: a fundamental lack of user understanding of cyber security. At every institution, therefore, we tried to carry out a malware
‘literacy campaign’ to teach employees how infections begin and how attackers can
subsequently control their computers to steal documents, all via a tiny, unauthorised program that can be maddeningly difficult to find.

2

Case Study: Hacking a Presidential Election

The most sensational hacktivist attack took place during Ukraine’s presidential elections. On 21 May 2014, CyberBerkut compromised the Central Election Commission (CEC), disabling core CEC network nodes and numerous components of the
election system. For nearly 20 hours, the software, which was designed to display
real-time updates in the vote count, did not work properly. On 25 May – election
day – 12 minutes before the polls closed (19:48 EET), the attackers posted on the
CEC website a picture of Ukrainian Right Sector leader Dmitry Yarosh, incorrectly
claiming that he had won the election. This image was immediately shown on Russian TV channels.
It is important to note here that this attack could in no way have determined the
outcome of the election. In Ukraine, every citizen inks his or her vote on a real paper

ballot, and all votes are manually verified. Each polling station in every corner of the
country physically delivers its ballots to CEC headquarters in Kyiv for aggregation,
reconciliation, and determination of the final tally. CEC’s information technology
(IT) infrastructure is a complex, geographically distributed system designed for
fault tolerance and transparency. Polling stations have an ‘anti-fraud’ design that
allows monitors to detect anomalies such as dramatically swinging vote counts and
report them to the appropriate authorities. Any serious disruption during an election would generate immediate suspicion about its legitimacy, and spark a desire for
a new election.
That said, I believe that we should not underestimate the ability of hackers –
especially those that enjoy state sponsorship – to disrupt the political process of a
nation. If CEC’s network had not been restored by 25 May, the country would simply have been unable to follow the vote count in real-time. However, to what extent
would that have caused citizens to question the integrity of the entire process? It is
hard to know.
CEC was not the only election-related site compromised. There were many others, including some that were only tangentially related to Ukrainian politics when,
for example, the word ‘election’ had unfortunately appeared somewhere on the site.
But even when attacks against low-level sites were unsophisticated, and the sites
basically continued to function, the attackers still got the press attention they sought.

malware on the CEC network (Sofacy/
APT28/Sednit). These two aspects of the
attack – disruption and espionage – may seem contradictory, but in fact they are
quite complementary. Hackers must first conduct in-depth reconnaissance of a target prior to any serious attack.
To bolster its technical credentials as an elite hacker group, CyberBerkut claimed
to have discovered and exploited a ‘zero-day’ vulnerability in CEC’s Cisco ASA software. In my opinion, it is highly unlikely that a non-state hacker group would possess such a high level of technical expertise. If CyberBerkut really did exploit a zeroday, the group is likely supported by a nation-state.
During my tenure as chief of CERT-UA, the CEC compromise was probably the
most technically advanced cyber attack we investigated. It was well planned, highly
targeted, and had some (albeit limited) real-world impact. Preparation for such an
attack does not happen overnight; based on our analysis of Internet Protocol (IP)
activity, the attackers began their reconnaissance in mid-March 2014 – more than
two months prior to the election. Neither does the level of required expertise sug-

gest that this was the work of amateurs; at a minimum, the hackers had gained
administrator-level access to CEC’s network.

Conclusion: What Is to Be Done?

Ukraine today faces cyber security challenges on at least two fronts. First, there are
technical attacks against a wide range of network infrastructure, including individual websites and whole Internet Service Providers (ISPs). These encompass everything from preoperational reconnaissance to social engineering against the target’s
employees. Second, there is an ongoing, content-driven information war within the
online media space designed to influence and deceive the public.
More serious threats lie over the horizon. In recent incident response activities
we have discovered samples of the most advanced forms of malware, including
BlackEnergy2/SandWorm, Potao, Turla/Urobros, and more.
In the face of these threats, Ukraine is currently unprepared. At the strategic
level, our senior officials are preoccupied with more pressing concerns. At the
tactical level, our law enforcement agencies still fail to grasp the basic connection
between email attachments, remote administrative software, and cyber espionage.
Today, there is no unified mechanism to monitor Ukraine’s network space, which
hinders our ability to detect cases of unauthorised access in a timely fashion.

through competitive salaries and more attractive working conditions.

Introduction: Cyber Conflict in Ukraine

I would like to tell the story of what I experienced in Ukraine from the autumn of
2013 until the end of 2014. In this chapter, I will describe the nature and impact of
numerous cyber attacks that took place during our revolution and the subsequent
conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
As background, it is important to understand the strategic value of Ukraine to
Russia. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe, with over 42 million citizens and
27 administrative divisions. In the past, its rich farmland and industrial base have
been coveted by Russia, Turkey, Poland, and even by Nazi Germany. Ukraine has
also made significant contributions in politics; the Ukrainian Cossacks created
the first constitution in contemporary European history. Following the horrors of
World War II, the country continued to suffer under Soviet rule until it regained its
independence in 1991. Despite that, Russia has never really let go of Ukraine.
Ukraine has had internet connectivity since 1990. As everywhere else in the
world, it has also had its share of cyber attacks. The majority of these have come
in the form of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) incidents against politically
or economically targeted websites. During election seasons, for example, hackers
have frequently gone after the websites of political parties. In terms of cyber crime,
Ukraine has long been home to carding, mobile operator fraud, spam factories,
cyberlockers, pirated software, unauthorized bank transfers, and various attacks on
rival businesses.

Responsibility for the enforcement of internet security in Ukraine belongs to the
Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVS) and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).1 Cyber
security regulations are overseen by the State Service of Special Communication and
Information Protection (SSSCIP),2 but the ultimate responsibility for cyber crimes has
never made explicit, and in this regard there has been competition between the MVS
and SBU. Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team was created in 2007.
National cyber security legislation is still in its nascent stages. Many of our current laws date from the Soviet era, and need to be updated for the information age.
The national critical infrastructure domain is still largely unregulated. Definitions
related to ‘cyber security’ and ‘information security’ are unclear, as is the distinction
between them.
Historically, the Ukrainian police have investigated straightforward cases related
to illegal content, online gambling, and pornography. Their number of qualified
personnel trained in cyber security was low, with little competency in computer or
network forensics. Therefore, their most common tactic was simply to confiscate all
IT equipment.
Given these circumstances, Ukraine is currently ill-prepared to combat advanced,
nation-state level cyber attacks. In the future, its specialists would like to see the
arrival of more non-governmental organisation (NGO) support from the European
Union and United States, with a view to implementing modern best practices and
internationally recognised standards.

The Impact of Euromaidan

The ‘Revolution of Dignity’ in Ukraine began in late 2013 when citizens took to the
streets to vent their fury at the decision of then-President Viktor Yanukovych not
to sign an agreement of political association with the European Union (EU). This
political movement became known as ‘Euromaidan’ – the Ukrainian word Maidan
means ‘square’ in English, and refers to the main square in the capital city, Kyiv.
On November 30, mobile phone communications were systematically shut down
through mobile operators, and armed police units physically attacked the protesters.
However, the population was undeterred, and by December 2, more than 500,000
people crowded into Maidan. The sitting government made several more attempts
to clear the city, using gas grenades and plastic bullets, and the author personally
suffered a long-term injury from exposure to tear gas. The crackdown eventually led
to the use of lethal force,3 likely killing well over 100 protestors.4

The SBU is a former constituent part to the Soviet KGB, and is still coming to terms with its legacy ideology and post-Soviet
corruption.
The SSSCIP was a former constituent part of SBU and has since had a conflicting relationship with its former parent over its
role in the information security arena.
The author believes that Russian Security Services took part in these killings.

The cyber attacks began on 2 December 2013 when it was clear that protesters were not going to leave Maidan. Opposition websites were targeted by DDoS
attacks, the majority of which came from commercial botnets employing BlackEnergy and Dirt Jumper malware.

media account, and were later used to
prosecute him. Police seized computers from the opposition party’s premises, and according to one city official, the
lighting in city hall (which had been a base of opposition activity) was switched
off remotely, via the internet.
Opposition activists also conducted cyber attacks against the Ukrainian Government, using tools such as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) to launch DDoS
attacks on the President’s website. When one group of protestors entered the Ministry of Energy, the organisation sounded a ‘red alert’ at Ukrainian nuclear facilities,
due to the fact that the national electricity grid is remotely controlled via the internet from headquarters.
During this period of intense cyber attacks in Ukraine, cyber criminal organisations proactively reduced their use of the Ukrainian Internet Protocol (IP) space,
rerouting their malware communications through Internet Service Providers (ISP)
in Belarus and Cyprus, which meant that, for the first time in years, Ukraine was not
listed among the leading national purveyors of cyber crime.5
The largest and most sophisticated attacks coincided with the lethal shooting of
protestors in Maidan (February 18-20, 2014). The mobile phones of opposition parliament members were flooded with SMS messaging and telephone calls in an effort
to prevent them from communicating and coordinating defences. One precision
attack (which targeted the protesters on only one street in Kyiv) entailed spamming
the IMSI catcher device on mobile phones with fake SMS messages, threatening the
recipient with prosecution for participation in the protest.6
In western Ukraine, the Government turned off the main opposition TV channel, and when protesters decided to enter police departments, those facilities were
disconnected from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and internet.
Despite all of these police actions, the now-radicalised protesters were unbowed,
and continued their revolutionary campaign. Therefore, on February 22, 2014,
Ukrainian President Yanukovich fled to Russia, and a new and reformist government was established in Kyiv.

Crimea and Donbass

By the end of April 2014, the Russian Government had responded to these events
by occupying and annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, as well as military
intervention in eastern Ukraine, where hostilities continue to this day.
From the start of its Crimean operation, the Russian army moved to gain control of the peninsula’s telecommunications infrastructure, severing cables and routing calls through Russian mobile operators. Ukrainian media companies lost their
physical assets in Crimea, and local television programming shifted from Ukrainian
to Russian channels. With physical access to its control infrastructure, Russia also

ately demanded the severing of communications links between Ukraine
and the occupied territory. However, its pro-Russian management refused, and
maintained unrestricted connectivity as long as possible, likely so that Russian security services could retain access to its internal systems, for intelligence gathering and
other information operations.
Ukrainian mobile operators saw an increase in the volume of cyber crime emanating from Crimea, and it is likely that Russian security services acquired intelligence from information collected in this way.
Pro-Russia media, discussion forums, and social network groups were active
in propaganda dissemination. The Crimea campaign was even buttressed by mass
changes in Wikipedia, where Russian propaganda teams altered articles related to
the events taking place there.
Today in Crimea, Russian authorities have implemented content filtering for
internet access, including the censorship of Ukrainian news sites. In November
2014, Russia announced it would create a cyber warfare-specific military unit in
Crimea.
Pro-Ukrainian hackers have attacked Crimean websites during the occupation,
such as that of the Crimean Parliament7 and a site linking to public web cameras.8
They have also released allegedly official Russian documents related to the conflict
which were claimed to be stolen from Russian government servers.9
As the conflict shifted to Donbass, cyberspace played an increasingly important role in military operations. Physical attacks destroyed cabling, broadcast infra7

Cyber Tactics

Cyberspace is a complex domain. In the Ukraine conflict, we have seen many different types of actors, tools, and tactics. Hacktivists have used the Low Orbit Ion
Cannon; criminals have used malware like Blackenergy and DirtJumper. But with
cyber attacks, attribution and motive are not always clear, and the level of deception is high. The pro-Russia hacker groups Cyberberkut and Cyber-riot Novorissia have conducted DDoS attacks and released stolen email and office documents
from Ukrainian officials. Russian media, parliament members, and pro-Russian

Ukrainian politicians often mention these groups by name, but true attribution is
difficult. For example, spam is used to deliver news about their operations.16
For DDoS, various types of network flooding have been used against web and
DNS servers from spoofed source IPs.17 Sometimes, the attacks overwhelmed internet channel bandwidth; at other times, they affected the capability of an internet
router to process packets. The offending
bots were located all over the world, but

of attack simply shifted to Ukrainian bots,
which served to defeat this protection
measure. During the revolution in Ukraine, DDoS attacks lasted up to weeks at a
time, which had never been seen before. Cloud DDoS protection services provided
some relief, but the attackers could usually find some worthwhile computer to shut
down, such as when they blocked updates to an online media portal.
Over time, computer security companies have improved their ability to place
malware into ‘families’ and attacks into ‘campaigns’. To some degree, this helps to
provide attribution, especially when some sophisticated, persistent campaigns can
only be the work of nation-state actors – for reasons of mission focus, cost, and the
overall level of operational effort required.
Researchers believe, for example, that the Ouroboros/Snake malware family,
which avoided detection for 8 years and actively targeted the Ukrainian Government, has Russian origins.18 With enough data, it is possible to see large cyber espionage campaigns that encompass many different types of targets; it is also possible
to see that they generally work within a particular time zone, such as Moscow.19
One possible Russia-based campaign against Ukraine (and other nations), called
Sandworm, exploits advanced ‘zero-day’ vulnerabilities and targets national critical
infrastructure.20 Finally, in ‘Operation Armageddon’, researchers believe that they
tied malware activity to ongoing Russian military operations in Ukraine.21

Even the pro-Russian NGO ‘Mothers of Soldiers,’ which fights the mobilization efforts of the Ukrainian army, uses spam to

The breadth of the attacks included IPv6->IPv4 to bypass DDoS filters, NTP amplification, slow HTTP POST packets against
vulnerable Apache servers, DAVOSET, and SSL renegotiation against misconfigured web servers. The maximum volume I am
aware of was <30 Gbt/s.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Ukraine is vulnerable to Russia, both in traditional geopolitical space and in cyberspace. In 2015, Ukrainians are still dependent on Russian web resources, including
social media (Vkontakte), email (Mail.ru), search engines (Yandex), antivirus software (Kaspersky), and much more. Our IT supply chain acquires hardware that is
either produced in Russia or travels through Russia – this creates vulnerabilities out
of the box, and facilitates future attacks.
Whereas Russia is a world leader in cyber espionage and attack, Ukraine’s security services are new and inexperienced. In the current conflict with Russia, the only
option available to Ukraine is simply a self-inflicted denial-of-service: block access
to pro-Russian sites, remove access to Russian TV channels, limit the use of Russian
hardware and software, ban mobile phone and social network usage for Ukrainian
soldiers, and sever network access with occupied eastern Ukraine.
In the future, Ukraine must modernise its cyber security legislation. One critical
aspect of that process will be transparency: it must publish proposed and new laws
on government websites so that they are easy to read and understand. In the past,
even the few websites available were often knocked offline by hackers.
There have been many lessons learned. Here are some of the author’s personal
recommendations to the Ukrainian Government:
• Clear Ukrainian IP space of botnets and misconfigured servers (NTP,
DNS, etc.) that facilitate cyber attacks;
• Remove illegal and pirated software from critical infrastructure and
public agencies;
• Reduce Ukraine’s IT dependency in the context of crisis scenarios;
• Implement continuity standards for media and telecoms in conflict
zones;
• Create mechanisms to reliably deliver messages from the government
to its citizens in occupied territories;
• Incorporate anti-DDoS solutions into Internet-facing services;
• Ensure multiple, independent routes for internet traffic between
Ukraine and the rest of the world;
• Implement effective filtering mechanisms on national traffic exchange
points;
• Develop a culture of continuous cyber attack monitoring, investigation, information sharing, and research;
• Develop strong cyber security and cryptography capabilities across
Ukraine;
• Implement effective civil society controls over unauthorised interception and collection of data;
• Improve emergency data erasure and disaster recovery capabilities;

65

• Provide resources to military and security services to effectively conduct large-scale cyber operations and computer forensics during their
missions; and
• Ensure supply chain security for IT services coming from Russia.
Finally, the world should not underestimate Russia, which is seeking to re-establish its former empire, to include Ukraine and other parts of the defunct Soviet
Union and Warsaw Pact. In the context of its wide-ranging political and military
campaigns, Russia has developed a cyber attack capability that can target national
critical infrastructures, via the internet, anywhere in the world.

Use of Strategic Cyber
Espionage and Information

Introduction

‘Cyber attacks’ and ‘cyber war’ are all too often characterised as independent phenomena limited to the cyber domain, somehow distinct from the broader dynamics
that define a conflict. An analysis of cyber conflict thus far suggests that such a perceived dichotomy is both inaccurate and unwise. Targeted internet-based assaults
cannot be divorced from their underlying geopolitical contexts, and there is small
likelihood that a ‘cyber war’ will ever take place that is limited only to the cyber
domain. On the contrary, governments have been shown to use cyber tools and
tactics as a broad instrument of statecraft, a tool for coercion, and a complement to
kinetic forces in conflict scenarios.

information operations.
cyber activities have included cyber espionage, ‘prepping the battlefield’, selective telegraphing of capabilities, and some hints
at destructive activity. Together, these operations have no doubt inexorably contributed to Moscow’s advantages over Kyiv, both on the ground and in shaping the con-

67

flict’s narrative in the public arena. This orchestration should come as no surprise
to Russian security analysts, as such an integrated approach is consistent with published Russian military doctrine. Russian strategic thinkers do not consider ‘cyber
war’ (or even the prefix ‘cyber’) as a distinct concept. Rather, computer network
operations are tools to be integrated into broader efforts to maintain political and
military dominance in a given theatre and, more broadly, in the domestic and global
courts of public opinion.
This chapter will ground strategic thinking on cyber conflict against the systematic cyber espionage that we believe Russia is leveraging in its conflict with Ukraine.
Rather than a ‘cyber war’ waged in a distinct networked domain, Russia’s strategy
has been to masterfully exploit the information gleaned from its worldwide computer network exploitation campaigns to inform its conduct, purposely distort public opinion, and maintain its dominant position in Ukraine.
The author will examine three types of interrelated Russian cyber operations
from a technical and targeting perspective:
1. Computer network exploitation (CNE) to gain a decisive information
advantage;
2. ‘Prepping the battlefield’ via denial and deception; and
3. Limited incidents of cyber disruption and destruction.

The Architecture and Artistry of
Russia’s Strategic Information Theft

Since the start of the Ukraine conflict, security companies have been increasingly
tracking, cataloguing, and exposing sustained Russian CNE campaigns. Overall
these Russian cyber threat groups have consistently focused on clandestinely stealing intelligence, most likely to give the Russian Government a strategic advantage.
The targets of these operations have repeatedly included Ukrainian, European, and
U.S. government targets, militaries, international and regional defence and political organisations, think tanks, media outlets, and dissidents. While it is difficult to
assess with certainty whether these cyber threat groups are directly tasked or supported by Moscow, there is a growing body of evidence indicating these cyber actors
are Russia-based, and that their activities highly likely benefit Moscow.
The security community’s ability to detect, track, and ultimately expose Russian
cyber operations seems to have improved since the Ukraine conflict began, even relative to overall trends in the industry on exposing threat activity. While determining
a direct causation between the conflict in Ukraine and a seemingly marked uptick in
observable Russian cyber activity is challenging, the timing is certainly notable. It is
exceedingly unlikely that Russian actors only just started conducting aggressive CNE

68

on a global scale, so why has our ability to track and expose their activity appear to
have improved? One reason may be that Russia’s current national security crisis has
increased its government’s collections requirements to state-supported hackers, which
has in turn accelerated the groups’ operational tempo. As a result, it may be more difficult for these actors to modify their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) on a
timely basis, which often results in them tipping their hand.
To shed light on how this sustained information theft is being carried out, the
following sections discuss some of the cyber tactics and compromised computer
infrastructure that FireEye has associated with two prominent hacker groups that
we believe operate from Russia, as well as a summary list of CNE-related activity
that is likely being used to give Moscow a geopolitical and military advantage.

APT29 (‘Advanced Persistent Threat’1 Group 29)

APT29 is a sophisticated and highly capable

less requires substantial resources to maintain.
APT29’s tools often leverage legitimate web services for malware command and
control mechanisms, which can make them more difficult to detect because they
appear to be benign communications at first glance.
3.1 APT29’s Targets: Consistent with Russian State Interests
APT29 typically targets entities to steal information that is closely linked to Russian geopolitical interests and priorities. The group’s recent operations suggest it
is particularly focused on targets of intelligence value that are related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis and related policy responses. This includes: western governments
(particularly foreign policy and defence-related targets); international security and
legal institutions; think tanks; and educational institutions.
APT29 usually compromises its victims via socially engineered spear phishing
emails– either with malicious email attachments, or through a link to download a
malicious file from a compromised website. The group’s decoy documents (‘lures’)
often topically align with their targets’ interests and work subject matter; this social
engineering technique is common and can be very effective. APT29 has also been
known to re-purpose and weaponise legitimate documents or information stolen
from its previously compromised networks. Example lure topics from legitimate
sources include content related to European Union sanctions on Russia, a voicemail

issues,2 a PDF report on terrorism, and discussions related to Caucasus regional
development and democratisation.3 APT29 has also used less tailored and pop culture-themed approaches, such as a faked e-fax, and videos of ‘Office Monkeys’.45
3.2 APT29’s Tools and Infrastructure: the Work of Professionals
The complex nature of APT29’s malware and infrastructure (requiring significant
financial resources and expertise for upkeep), combined with its operational security practices and target sets strongly suggests some level of Russian state sponsorship. Its typical work hours (as defined by active operations in networks the group
has compromised) fall within the UTC+3 time zone, which aligns to the time zones
of Moscow and St. Petersburg. Furthermore, APT29 has been known to temporarily
halt its operations on Russian holidays.6
APT29 has been highly active throughout 2015, employing new data theft tools
as well as pursuing new targets for stealing information. To maintain operational
security, APT29 often configures its malware to activate only at predetermined
times, and is adept at using misdirection and obfuscation TTPs7 that hinder reverse
engineering and other means of analysis. One complicated APT29 backdoor, HAMMERTOSS, is highly capable of evading detection, particularly by its ability to mimic
the behaviour of legitimate users.8 HAMMERTOSS accomplishes this stealthiness
by leveraging commonly visited websites and web services to relay commands and
steal data from victims. The tool works by:
• Checking in and retrieving commands via legitimate web services,
such as Twitter and GitHub;
• Using compromised web servers for command and control (C2);
• Visiting different Twitter handles daily and automatically;
• Using timed starts, such as communicating only after a specific date or
only during the victim’s workweek;
• Obtaining commands via images containing hidden and encrypted
data (steganography); and
• Extracting information from a compromised network by uploading
files to commonly used cloud storage services.9

APT28 (also known as Tsar Team/Sofacy/Pawn Storm)

APT28 is another Russian cyber espionage group that frequently targets European
security organisations, Eastern European governments and militaries, international
media outlets, think tanks, defence companies, domestic dissident populations, and
entities in the Caucasus. This list is not exhaustive.11 The following table summarises
some of what currently know about APT28.12
Like APT29, APT28 works in a highly professional manner worthy of its
‘advanced persistent threat’ moniker. Security researchers believe its malware is
written in a Russian language development environment, and that it has been systematically updating its tools, some of which are also able to target mobile devices13
since 2007.
One way to appreciate the sophisticated nature of APT28 is through its exploitation of ‘zero-day’ vulnerabilities; that is, previously undiscovered and unpatched
vulnerabilities. For example, in early 2015, APT28 likely exploited two zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows in an attack against a government contractor.14 In a separate incident in July 2015, APT28 rapidly integrated into
its operations multiple zero-day vulnerabilities exposed in the highly public breach
of the Italian exploit dealer Hacking Team.15

A Crowded Playing Field:
Additional Examples of Russian CNE

Numerous cyber security companies have characterised a range of suspected
Russian state-sponsored cyber activity and malware. Overall, there are recurring
themes in their findings, which suggests

espionage campaigns ongoing across the
globe since at least 2007 (and no doubt
much earlier) has probably given these actors a considerable information advantage. A few examples are as follows.
In September 2015, Kaspersky Labs published research exposing multiple Russian APT groups ‘using and abusing’ satellite-based internet links (particularly
IP addresses in Middle Eastern and African countries) to hide their operational
command and control. This infrastructure likely enables a high degree of operational security. One of the groups using this tactic is the same group behind
the Snake/Uroburos/Turla malware, thought to be related to the infamous Agent.

tary entities, universities, research organisations, and pharmaceutical companies
worldwide.16
In August 2015, a group of security researchers described the enterprise-like
effort behind the Gameover ZeuS malware and its prolific and FBI-sought author
Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev (a.k.a. ‘Slavik’). The malware was used to facilitate
both cyber crime and espionage. Further, the researchers discovered commands in
the malware indicating that the actors sought to gather classified information from
victims in Ukraine, Georgia, and Turkey,17 suggesting a link between Russia’s cyber
crime syndicates and government espionage actors.
In late 2014, researchers exposed a long-active Russian group called ‘Sandworm,’
whose victims included NATO, the Ukrainian Government, EU governments,
energy and telecommunications firms, and an American academic organisation.
The group used zero-day exploits and infected victims through a variety of means
including malicious PowerPoint attachments and the BlackEnergy toolkit.18
Between 2013 and 2014, actors using the Snake/Uroburos/Turla malware targeted Ukrainian computer systems in dozens of cyber operations launched by ‘committed and well-funded professionals’.19 This malware is highly complex, reistant to
countermeasures, and thought to have been created in 2005.20
Since 2013, ‘Operation Armageddon’ – a Russian cyber espionage campaign
allegedly targeting Ukrainian government, law enforcement, and military officials
– has likely helped provide a military advantage to Russia vis-à-vis Ukraine from
secrets systematically gathered from cyber espionage. 21
In 2012, suspected Russian actors reportedly used the Wipbot and Snake backdoors
for long-term cyber espionage. The actors leveraged legitimate (but compromised) websites to systematically deliver malware, particularly to victims in Eastern Europe.22

‘mapping’ of an adversary’s cyber infrastructure is in principle the same concept. Computer networks, however, are harder
to map: like living organisms, they constantly evolve. Therefore, today’s map might
not be good tomorrow, which is why Russian malware implants like HAMMERTOSS are designed to sustain clandestine access.
6.1 Preparing for Attack?
Is Russia preparing for future cyber attacks on Western critical infrastructure? This
is difficult to prove, but the Sandworm group has reportedly targeted supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment, which is used in industrial and
critical infrastructure settings, with the BlackEnergy toolkit.26 The victims were production systems, not vendor-owned prototypes or systems that contained financial
information, intellectual property, or political intelligence. Given the targets seemed
to be production systems, there would likely be no benefit from an espionage perspective to infect these systems. Rather, the actors using the malware may have been
looking for weaknesses to exploit in a future disruptive scenario. In addition, the
use of a crimeware toolkit offers a degree of anonymity or plausible deniability for
actors with more destructive purposes.

Deception and Telegraphing Intent:
APT28 and TV5Monde

Russia has a long history of using information operations and deception to create
confusion or sow panic to ultimately create favourable conditions for their activity.27
This tactic has simply evolved for the internet era to include online misinformation campaigns and propaganda, and extensive internet trolling. One of the more
remarkable incidents this year included APT28’s possible use of false flag operation
against a French TV station.
In April 2015, hackers claiming to be the Islamic State-affiliated ‘Cyber Caliphate’ hacked France’s TV5 Monde channel, shutting off transmissions for eighteen
hours, and posting Islamic State propaganda on the TV5 Monde’s Facebook and
Twitter accounts. The attack also apparently resulted in significant damage to the
channel’s broadcasting infrastructure.28
This incident generated enormous publicity and speculation over Cyber Caliphate’s apparently growing capabilities and intent. However, technical analysis of the
attackers’ network infrastructure (such as the IP block hosting the Cyber Caliphate’s
website, its server, and registrar)29 as well as some other sensitive source reporting
related to the malware used suggests that Russia’s APT28 was in fact the more likely
perpetrator of this attack. French Police concurred with this conclusion, stating
‘Russian hackers linked to the Kremlin’ may have been responsible’.30 In a similar
vein, The New York Times reported that a Russian organisation known as the ‘Internet Research Agency’ had conducted systematic online trolling and hoaxes in the
U.S., including a spoofed Islamic State attack against a Louisiana chemical plant on
the anniversary of 9/11.31
If APT28 (or another Russian hacker group) conducted these attacks, what were
their motivations? There are a number of plausible scenarios, including:
• Russian actors may have been displeased at TV5 Monde coverage of
the Ukraine conflict, and this was an act of retribution;
• Russian actors wanted to distract attention from the Kremlin’s actions
in Ukraine by shifting the focus of Western national security planners
to the Islamic State;

‘Cyber War’ in Ukraine – Not Much to See Here

There have been significant cyber espionage operations directed against victims
related to Russia’s strategic interests, particularly in regards to the situation in
Ukraine. However we have not seen high profile, coercive and damaging attacks
similar to those waged on Estonia in 2007 or Georgia in 2008.

undermine Ukraine’s telecommunications
infrastructure. For the attackers, these
were likely a low-risk way to disrupt the flow of information within the Ukrainian
national security space, as well as a way to selectively and temporarily silence specific voices online. Some of the known incidents are listed below:
• November 2013: Russian hackers reportedly defaced and DDoS’ed the
websites of several Ukrainian TV stations, news outlets, and politicians.32
• February 2014: Russian troops allegedly tampered with Ukraine’s fibre
optic cables and raided Ukrtelecom, which stated that it had ‘lost the
technical capacity to provide connection between the peninsula and
the rest of Ukraine and probably across the peninsula, too’.33 In Crimea,
mobile, landline, and internet access were all affected.
• March 2014: As Russian troops entered Crimea, the main Ukrainian
Government website was shut down for nearly 72 hours,34 many other
official government and media websites were targeted in DDoS attacks,35
and the cell phones of many Ukrainian parliamentarians were ‘hacked’.36

• May 2014: the pro-Russian hacktivist group CyberBerkut claimed
responsibility for a breach of the systems of Ukraine’s Central Election Commission with malware that would have deleted the results of
the presidential election. However, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU)
removed the malware and replaced the election software prior to the
vote.37
Outside of these limited publicly reported incidents, it appears that the Kremlin
has either not needed or not chosen to engage in extensive overt CNA during this
conflict. One reason for this could be that Moscow wants to avoid the international
criticism that followed its alleged cyber operations in the 2008 war in Georgia, and
in Estonia in 2007. Instead, Moscow seems to be using more narrowly focused, limited operations in support of strategic state objectives, primarily via sustained cyber
espionage rather than widespread attacks.

Information War, Not Cyber War

In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, computer network operations have not been limited
to trite notions of ‘cyber war.’ Rather, an examination of the sustained tensions suggests that this has been a war waged with and by the strategic theft and manipulation
of information, and not extensive application of destructive cyber attacks. Russia’s
unrelenting cyber espionage campaigns over time, and against so many targets, have
no doubt given it a considerable advantage

information.
While we do not always have definitive
attribution, the malicious cyber tools and
attacker infrastructure used by these suspected Russian government-backed actors
in many ways mimic what we would expect from Russian intelligence operatives,
defined by stealth, artistry in tradecraft, and a high regard for operational security.
Yet, as mirrored in Russia’s real-life politics, some of the actors also appeared flippant and even brazen at times, characteristics that could reflect an absence of fear
of getting caught or any sense of effective deterrence. In this sense, such behaviour
will no doubt continue, and it remains of the utmost important to anticipate and
defend against this activity, both for short-term network security and for long-term
international stability.

Cyber Proxies and
the Crisis in Ukraine
Tim Maurer

Introduction

In July 2015, I travelled to Kyiv to investigate the role of cyber proxy actors as part
of a long-term, global research project on the issue. The Ukrainian crisis seemed
like the perfect case study to explore how states use non-state actors and their capabilities. The findings confirmed some of my assumptions but also revealed some
surprises. This article outlines what I learned during the trip based on interviews
with 11 individuals including current and former government officials, private sector representatives, security researchers, and Eugene Dokukin, the ‘commander’ of
the Ukrainian Cyber Forces, in addition to a review of existing literature.1
To start, the crisis in Ukraine has several ingredients that appear to make the use
of proxies by a state likely, namely (1) an ongoing hot conflict, fuelling (2) incentives
for the state to use proxy capabilities and (3) significant capabilities residing outside
of but available to the state. With regard to the second, this includes the general
political incentive to be able to claim plausible deniability as well as incentives for
the state to augment its own capabilities by adding those provided by non-state
actors.
It is also helpful to distinguish between two dimensions when analysing proxy
actors to ensure greater analytical clarity. First, analysing proxy actors is part of the
broader academic inquiry into the governance of violence best described by the title

of Deborah Avant’s seminal book The Market for Force – The Consequences of Privatizing Security. In that book, Avant investigates the market for force and the role of
public and private actors including proxies.2 The second, narrower dimension focuses
on proxy actors used ‘to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.3 This is
the language used in the most recent report of the Group of Governmental Experts
(GGE) that is leading the international community’s global cybersecurity norms effort
under the auspices of the United Nations. Unlike the first dimension which examines
proxy actors more broadly including those that are used by states for defensive purposes, this second lens is about proxy actors used to cause harm to another party.
This short chapter will look at both private actors involved in the general provision of security for the benefit of the state, and private actors using force against
a third party to the benefit of the state, but will focus on the latter. The first section
outlines in greater detail the conditions present in the region assumed to contribute
to the existence of proxy actors. The second part describes the proxy actors that are
publicly known to have been active during the crisis.

The Making of a Hot Conflict

The hot conflict between Ukraine and Russia was the result of simmering political tension that escalated in November 2013, when former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych abandoned plans to sign a trade agreement with the EU. Yanukovych’s decision incited mass protests that were met
with a violent government crackdown. In

Ukrtelecom, which stated afterward that it had ‘lost the technical capacity to provide
connection between the peninsula and the rest of Ukraine and probably across the
peninsula, too’.5 In addition, cell phones of Ukrainian parliamentarians were hacked
and the main Ukrainian government website was shut down for 72 hours after Russian troops entered Crimea on March 2. Patriotic Ukrainian hacker groups such as
‘Cyber Hundred’ and ‘Null Sector’ retaliated with DDoS attacks of their own against
websites of the Kremlin and the Central Bank of Russia.6 The day before the presidential election, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) discovered malware in the systems
of the Central Election Commission designed to compromise data collected on the
results of the election, revealing how close Russian hackers had come to sabotaging
the results.7 The hacker group ‘Cyber Berkut’ claimed responsibility.8

context of maritime privateering, it was:
‘invented [by state rulers] at the turn of the seventeenth century. If a ‘private’
undertaking that a ruler authorised met with success, s/he could claim a share
in the profits. If the enterprise caused conflict with another state, the ruler could
claim it was a private operation for which s/he could not be held responsible’.9
While some of the specific elements of maritime privateering are no longer relevant today, the general concept and logic for this type of behaviour still apply and
exist today. For example, the Russian Government denied any involvement in the
Ukrainian crisis for many months, in spite of eyewitness accounts and news reports
plainly stating otherwise. One particularly horrible example of plausible deniability
was the mass murder of the passengers on Malaysia Airlines flight 17.
The benefits of plausible deniability also apply to the Ukrainian Government.

occasionally publishes data from the Russian Ministry of the Interior, and at one
point threatened to shut down the internet in the Crimea and other cities in eastern
Ukraine.10 There is no evidence suggesting that the Ukrainian Government coordinates or directly supports any of the Ukrainian Cyber Forces’ activities, and my
own research supports this conclusion. At the same time, the Government benefits
from its activities with or without its involvement. For the Ukrainian Government,
another set of incentives is arguably more important than the political ones: its own
limited capabilities, and the possibility to rely on proxy actors to augment these
capabilities in the face of a much more powerful opponent.
The Russian Government is considered to be among the most sophisticated
actors with significant in-house cyber capabilities,11 and the government in Ukraine
faced a dire situation at the beginning of the conflict. Its military had essentially
been falling apart since the end of the Soviet Union and Kyiv was ill-prepared for a
conflict with Russia. As Dmitry Gorenburg points out:
‘At the time of its creation, the Ukrainian military was considered the fourth
most powerful conventional military force in the world, behind only the United
States, Russia, and China. However, these forces were allowed to atrophy
throughout the post-Soviet period, with virtually no funding provided for the
maintenance of equipment or troop training. Reforms were not carried out and
there were no attempts at rearmament to replace aging Soviet equipment’.12
The responses from several interviewees confirmed this assessment.

Capabilities Outside the State

In order for a state to be able to pursue the incentives of using proxy actors, private
actor capabilities must exist in the first place. With regard to cyberspace, such capabilities include those present within a state’s territory and beyond. Regarding the
former, significant capabilities have been present in Ukraine and Eastern Europe
since the 1980s. Misha Glenny, the award-winning journalist, recounts in his 2011
book Dark Market – How Hackers Became the New Mafia that:
‘The hackers of Eastern Europe played a particularly important role in cracking security devices played on software…Bulgaria, Ukraine and Russia set the
pace, with the Romanians not far behind.’13

Ukraine was the cradle of CarderPlanet, which was ‘changing the nature of cybercrime around the world’.14 One explanation why technically skilled people in the region
decided to pursue cybercrime to make a living was the lack of other opportunities. For
example, a job in the Ukrainian Government for somebody in his 20s pays roughly
$3,000 – a year, not a month. And while Samsung has one of its largest R&D centres in
Kyiv, the private IT industry is neither large nor attractive enough to absorb all of the
skilled labour, unlike in Israel, for example.15 Interestingly, ‘CarderPlanet was penetrated
and compromised by the Russian Secret Police almost as soon as it was set up’ but:
‘why would the KGB waste resources on investigating networks that are ripping
off American and European credit cards? A complete waste of time. So for the
moment, Moscow was content to observe and store information. They knew
exactly who was who in the Odessa carding community’.16
Yet, it was not only the FSB that knew what was happening in Eastern European
countries. In 2009, Brian Krebs, an expert on cybercrime in the region and widely
read not only by law enforcement officials in the U.S. but also Ukraine, wondered:
‘whether authorities in those countries would be any more willing to pursue
cyber crooks in their own countries if they were forced to confront just how
deeply those groups have penetrated key government and private computer
networks in those regions?’
An example is Dmitry Ivanovich Golubov, once considered a top cybercrime
boss by U.S. law enforcement, but now a leader of the Ukrainian Internet Party
participating in parliamentary elections. Russian agencies reportedly provide little
assistance with shutting down networks such as the Russian Business Network. Last
but not least, cyber criminals also do their best to avoid attracting local law enforcement attention. As Krebs notes:
‘Some of the most prolific and recognizable malware disbursed by Russian and
East European cyber crime groups purposefully avoids infecting computers if
the program detects the potential victim is a native resident.’17
In sum, there is no shortage in the region of labour skilled in information technology and hacking, while a mature industry is missing, and government salaries of
a few thousand dollars a year pale in comparison to reports of thousands or millions
of dollars made in the latest cyber heist.

Mapping and Analysis of Proxy Actors

There are several important findings regarding proxies and the conflict in Ukraine.
The first is that proxy actors are active as part of the conflict in Ukraine. The
second is that the amount of cyber proxy activity has remained relatively low.
There are two likely explanations for this: there has been a relatively low number
of significant cyber incidents associated with the conflict other than during its
initial phase as described above; and while there was clearly a significant wave
of patriotism and willingness by Ukrainian citizens to volunteer and support the
government, several interviewees suggested that the government in Kyiv did not
have the ability to absorb and coordinate these extra capacities. In other words, to
draw from the political science literature on power, while significant cyber power
resources in the hands of private actors existed, the Ukrainian Government was
not able to effectively mobilise these resources to actually project power. Kyiv’s
cyber power was inhibited by a lack of what Alexander Klimburg calls ‘integrated
national capability’.18
Thirdly, the conflict does not appear to have mobilised the most sophisticated non-state actors with cyber capabilities in the region – the cybercriminals
– to change their profit-driven behaviour
to more politically-driven action. While the

realised that their spat started to affect their

cybersecurity company Berezha Security.19
A closer look reveals a range of proxy actors has been active. In the context of
a broader analysis of the market for force, it is notable that the crisis in Ukraine
demonstrated that cybersecurity is a domain where private actors possess significant capabilities and are used by states for both defensive and offensive purposes.
For example, the limited capabilities of the Ukrainian Government have been augmented through NATO assistance, namely its Cyber Defence Trust Fund, to train
and improve Ukraine’s cyber defences. Interestingly, the lead NATO member providing that assistance, Romania, has itself not been providing this assistance directly
through its government, but is relying on a proxy actor, a state-owned company
called Rasirom, to provide the service.20

While criminal groups have not been active players in the Ukraine conflict, the
most prominent proxy actors have been hacktivist groups. These groups include proKyiv OpRussia, Russian CyberCommand (which considers itself to be part of Anonymous),21 Cyber Ukrainian Army, Cyber Hundred, Null Sector,22 and the pro-Moscow CyberBerkut and Anonymous Ukraine.23 Their activities have been limited to
DDoS attacks, web defacements, and the occasional leaking of government files.
The most serious incident involved the aforementioned targeting of the Ukrainian
voting system during the Ukrainian Presidential election. While Ukrainian government officials and many news reports blame the Russian Government for indirectly
orchestrating these operations, as well as for the crude ‘hack attacks’ on Ukrainian
state websites, the Russian Government has vehemently denied accusations that it
has any influence over these groups. Evidence for a relationship between pro-Russian separatists or hacker groups such as Cyber Berkut and the Russian Government
remains lacking.
The Ukrainian Cyber Force has been among the most prominent Ukrainian
hacktivist groups. It is led by Eugene Dokukin and a group of volunteers he recruited
through social media, whose number has fluctuated from several dozens to a few
hundred, and primarily includes ordinary citizens without a technical background.24
The Ukrainian Cyber Force combines a series of different activities, ranging from
the unauthorised monitoring of CCTV cameras in eastern Ukraine and Russia, to
reporting troop and separatist activities to web companies in an effort to shut down
their accounts, launching DDoS attacks against websites, and leaking sensitive documents from the Russian Government. While Dokukin has given a series of interviews and shares information about his actions with the media and the government,
there is no evidence that the government coordinates or supports him financially or
otherwise. Instead, the government has been turning a blind eye.
Related to the conflict in Ukraine are the findings of several industry reports.
The U.S.-based security company FireEye published a report titled ‘APT28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?’, detailing the activities of a group
conducting political espionage against East European countries and security organisations. FireEye:
‘conclude[s] that we are tracking a focused, long-standing espionage effort.
Given the available data, we assess that APT28’s work is sponsored by the Russian Government’.25

Perhaps the most interesting report is the one published by the Finnish firm
F-Secure titled ‘BlackEnergy & Quedagh – The convergence of crimeware and APT

developed and used for criminal profit-driven purposes, was deployed against government organisations in Ukraine by a group the report calls ‘Quedagh’. The report
concludes by stating that:
‘the use of BlackEnergy for a politically-oriented attack is an intriguing convergence of criminal activity and espionage. As the kit is being used by multiple
groups, it provides a greater measure of plausible deniability than is afforded by
a custom-made piece of code.’ 26

Conclusion

The conflict in Ukraine includes a range of proxy actors and proxy activity. This should
be expected given the existence of a hot conflict, the presence of significant cyber capabilities in private hands, and incentives for the nations involved to use these private
capabilities. However, the amount of cyber proxy activity has remained relatively low,
much like the overall level of computer network operations compared to what some
experts predicted. It is notable that the conflict does not appear to have politicised and
mobilised the most sophisticated non-state actors with cyber capabilities – the cybercriminals – to change their profit-driven behaviour to more politically-driven action.
Moreover, the Ukrainian Government has not had the capacity and strategy in place to
be able to absorb the additional capabilities provided by volunteers. Kyiv has therefore
not been able to mobilise and project the full potential of Ukraine’s power due to the
limited use of its true power resources. While the Ukrainian Government regularly
accuses the Russian Government of using proxies, there seems to be less vehemence
from the Russian side criticising, for example, the activities of the Ukrainian Cyber
Forces. According to one interviewee, one explanation is that the Russian Government has more to gain from being able to point to the existence of Ukrainian proxies
in order to thereby indirectly legitimise the existence of Russian proxies.
While this chapter hopefully shed some light on the role of proxy actors in the
Ukraine conflict, it is necessary to point to some important limitations and issues
that were beyond the scope of this short piece. First, the term ‘proxies’ lacks a clear
definition. While it is used in the GGE report, it is not defined, even though the
report distinguishes ‘proxies’ as a separate type of actor from state and non-state
actors. Developing a more systematic and nuanced analytical framework for proxies
is therefore the focus of my current research. This will hopefully be useful for future
empirical research on proxy actors around the world, as well as for ongoing policy
discussions through the GGE and elsewhere.

Introduction

‘Information is now a species of weapon’,1 write Russians Maj. Gen. (R) Ivan Vorobyev and Col. (R) Valery Kiselyov. Closer to the truth is that Russia has a long history
of using information as a weapon – both in the context of mobilising its own population2 and in demonising foreign powers.3
Therefore, it is only natural that Russia has employed Information Warfare (IW)
in Ukraine: from the onset of the ‘Euromaidan’ demonstrations, to the annexation
of Crimea, and as a dimension of ongoing military operations in eastern Ukraine.
And it is equally unsurprising that, in the internet era, Moscow has developed effective tactics for waging IW in cyberspace.
This chapter discusses contemporary Russian IW theory and analyses Russian
IW activities on the ground in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine. While the dynamic
and diffuse nature of IW makes it difficult to gauge its precise impact, this chapter argues that Russian IW in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine has been highly
successful, and that the West is currently playing catch up vis-à-vis Russia in this
arena.

Information Security and Cyber Security
in Russian Military Theory

In Russian government and academic circles, information is understood to be a
form and source of great power. This was true well before the advent of the internet
and cyberspace – which have not changed Russian IW strategy, but only its tactics.
In the West, cyber security and information security are considered to be two
different things. In Russia, however, cyber is subordinate to information security,
which allows national security planners to oversee both technical data (e.g. the
integrity of password files) and cognitive data (e.g. political information on websites). Thus, any information found on the World Wide Web could be a ‘missile’
fired at Russia that is more dangerous than a typical cyber attack as currently understood in the West.
The logical consequence of this Russian perspective is to define and to protect
the borders of the Russia’s ‘information space’ (информационное пространство),
and this philosophy is to be found easily in Russian doctrines, strategies, and activities both at home and abroad – including in Ukraine.
For example, Russia’s National Security Strategy 2020 states that ‘nationalist, separatist, radical religion’ is a danger to nation-states, and that a ‘global information
struggle’ is now intensifying. The document proposes to counter this threat by disseminating ‘truthful’ information to Russian citizens, including via the promotion
of native internet platforms encompassing social media.4
As for the importance of cyberspace, numerous official documents describe
computer network operations as an integral part of Russian information security,
including: Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation,5 ConInformation superiority in

Academic discourse within the Russian military is similar. From a historical perspective, progress in computer science has wrought a new generation of warfare in
which the achievement of information superiority in cyberspace is an essential goal.
Within any desired zone of influence, this includes attacks against and defence of

will to resist.
Sergei Chekinov and Lt. Gen. (R) Sergei
Bogdanov go even further: ‘Today the means of information influence reached such
perfection that they can tackle strategic tasks’.9
Checkinov and Bogdanov point out – in the aftermath of the annexation of
Crimea and the current destabilisation of Ukraine – that information can be used
to disorganise governance, organise anti-government protests, delude adversaries,
influence public opinion, and reduce an opponent’s will to resist. Furthermore, it
is critical that such activities begin prior to the onset of traditional military operations.10
At least since Soviet times, Russia considers itself to be a victim of IW, engaged in
a battle between the ‘historical Russian world’ (of which Ukraine is a part) and the
West where the US is its principal antagonist.11 Professor Igor Panarin has described
a ‘first information war’ during the Cold War that resulted in the demise of the Soviet
Union. Today, he sees an ‘Operation ANTI-PUTIN’ modelled on an earlier ‘Operation ANTI-STALIN’. He contends that Western IW was behind both the Arab Spring12
and Euromaidan, and that WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange is an agent of the British MI6.13
Panarin believes there is a ‘second information war’ taking place against countries
such as Russia and Syria which began at least by the time of the Russo-Georgian war
in 2008.14 Russian President Vladimir Putin has characterised the rift between Russia
and the West as an incompatibility of values («духовные ценности»).15
Panarin is far from being the only contemporary Russian military thinker arguing this line. A group of five authors recently wrote in Russia’s Military Thought that
‘The NATO countries led by the US … have set up a powerful information operations (IO) system and are going on expanding and improving it’.16

Even Russia, however, is not a monolith.17 Some military scholars have criticised
the prevailing view and have suggested that a distinction should be drawn between
attacks on technical and cognitive data, detailing a ‘technospheric war’ largely corresponding to the Western perception of ‘cyber war’.18 Similarly, a publicly available
draft of the next Cyber Security Strategy of the Russian Federation problematises the
difference between the Russian and the Western views on the matter, suggesting that
cyber security and information security be treated as distinct challenges. However,
to date these remain unimplemented proposals.

Russian IW in Crimea and Novorossiya19

Russian IW in Ukraine began well before the current conflict. The Security Services
of Ukraine (SBU) warned that its government officials had been targeted by Russian
espionage malware (variously called ‘Snake’, ‘Uroboros’ or ‘Turla’) since 2010.20,21,22
Successful cyber espionage can have a strategic impact. In a military context, it can
be directly linked to a desire to gain information superiority on the battlefield,23 and
can sometimes be easy to associate with ongoing military operations.24
In Crimea, just as soon as insignia-less armed fighters appeared on the scene

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu27 denied the participation of Russian troops
in the Crimea takeover – even though Ukrainian troops on the peninsula were
forced into a quick, large-scale surrender.2829
In warfare, there has always been a tight relationship between IW and traditional
military operations. In Crimea, the entire course of events – from the takeover of
the Simferopol parliament to the disputed referendum and the Russian annexation
of Crimea – was enveloped in a sophisticated effort to control the flow of information. Russian IW extended across the entire spectrum of communication in both
the cyber and non-cyber domains, targeting its physical, logical, and social layers.
In early March, Ukrtelecom reported kinetically damaged fiber-optic trunk cables,
as well as the temporary seizure of its company’s offices. Further disclosures detailed
the jamming of Ukrainian naval communications.30 SBU Chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko declared that Ukrainian government officials’ mobile communications were
subjected to an ‘IP-telephonic attack’.31 And on the World Wide Web, government sites
and news portals suffered Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and defacements – all of which contributed to a significant information blackout.32,33
The ‘hacktivist’ group Cyberberkut34 has repeatedly claimed to have gained access
to telephone recordings and e-mail correspondence between Ukrainian, European
Union (EU) and US officials – and released some content to prove it. Cyberberkut
also allegedly attacked the Ukrainian electronic voting system and defaced several
NATO websites.35
The importance of gaining information superiority in warfare can be seen in
how much time and resources have been spent in creating official, semi-official,
and unofficial sources of war-related information, including dedicated channels on
YouTube.36
The success of IW is hard to gauge, but these attacks likely made it more difficult
for Kyiv to gain a clear picture of what was happening in Crimea – which in turn
presumably hampered its decision-making process. Even unsophisticated cyber
attacks tend to generate significant media attention, and as a bonus can sow general
distrust in systems and their security architecture.37

Ukrainian military commentator Dmitry Tymchuk, speaking on behalf of the
‘Information Resistance’ group,38 accused the interim government in Kyiv of lacking
clarity and moving too slowly,39 and Ukrainian parliament (Verhovna Rada) member Gennady Moskal complained that Ukrainian troops had not received permission to use their weapons in time.40
Today, the war in eastern Ukraine can also be described as a hall of IW smoke
and mirrors. On 17 April, 2014, Vladimir Putin referred to the south-eastern part
of Ukraine as Novorossiya, and a similarly named ‘confederation’ was formally
created on May 24, 2014.41 However, an analysis of web data shows that cyber
preparations were made prior to this announcement: Novorossiya websites such
as novorus.info and novorossia.su were registered with who.is in March 2014,
and the official websites of the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk were
registered before the entities came into being.42 Finally, Moscow has consistently
denied that its military personnel are engaged in Ukraine, but web-based studies
have found evidence of their deployments to Ukraine43 as well as their involvement in the crash of the Malaysian Airlines flight 17,44 via social media and imagery analysis.45

The Unique Characteristics of Russian IW

The Russian political narrative – aimed at both domestic and foreign audiences –
describes a ‘Russian World’ (Русский Мир), ‘Russian values’, and even a ‘Russian
soul’. The narrative’s articulation begins at the very top, in the person of Vladimir
Putin, and flows downward in a pyramidal fashion through traditional media and
cyberspace all the down to the grassroots level. It targets not just Russian citizens but
the entire Russian-speaking population of planet Earth. Beyond that, it is expected
that the narrative’s influence will organically spread outside the diaspora.
The basic storyline is easy to comprehend and to convey, and is intended to be
become a foundation for the interpretation of current and future world events. In
this narrative, Russia is a misunderstood and misjudged superpower, and a necessary counterweight to Western liberal values. By contrast, the West has experienced

‘Information Resistance’ is, according to its own description on http://sprotyv.info/en/about-us, a non-governmental project
that aims to counteract external threats to the informational space of Ukraine’. The group provides operational data and analytics. As one of the project’s front figures, Dmitry Tymchuk has provided analysis to, amongst others, Kyiv Post and Huffington

a decay of ‘traditional values’ and acts hypocritically in the international arena. As a
result, the West’s philosophy, systems, and actions should not be trusted.
At the bottom of the pyramid, the Russian political narrative is absorbed into
individual group ideologies in different ways. For example, nationalists focus on
Russia’s historic power, while communist groups decry capitalism. Each group
self-selects and customises the narrative in unique ways that correspond to their
own natural biases. And this stovepiping dynamic also tends to bypass critical peer
review from the wider public.
This group dynamic capitalises on the pre-established interpersonal trust characteristic of online social media – a by-product of information overload in the internet
era. There are many groups which are naturally sceptical of mainstream information
channels, such as the population of the Former Soviet Union, where citizens have
long had little trust in official media. In Moscow, the word of friends and colleagues
is immeasurably more important than that of mass media.46
One of the latest developments in this arena has been the rise of professional
‘trolls’ and other (sometimes anonymous) ‘opinion agents’. Such operations (in Russian military terminology ‘maskirovka’ (маскировка), or denial and deception) can
be countered through the effective analysis of open source information, but usually not in a timely manner. Therefore, analysts and scholars must exercise caution,
because online persona, images, messages, and campaigns can be wholly fabricated.

Conclusion

The global internet offers military and intelligence agencies the opportunity to
expand and enhance IW, and it simultaneously presents their targets and victims
with novel challenges. Russian IW – both in traditional media and in cyberspace
– tangibly contributed to the successful annexation of Crimea, and is playing an
important role in the ongoing crisis in eastern Ukraine. On balance, this author
believes that Russia, and not the West, currently has the lead in contemporary IW.
Unlike propaganda in Soviet times, which was largely a unidirectional, top-down
phenomenon, today’s IW encompasses a worldwide audience that is both narrative-bearing and narrative-developing. Domestic, diaspora, and foreign audiences
interact with current events in real time as they travel through online platforms
such as social media. This dynamic makes it more challenging for propagandists to
predict how and where the narrative will evolve, but to some degree it is possible to
presume how certain political groups will interpret the narrative and how they will
describe it to their followers.
In sum, the traditional ‘fog of war’ has changed in the internet era. The ubiquity and anonymity of internet communications offer all nations including Russia

to counter adversary operations with accurate open source analysis (for journalists,48
scholars, and activists49), this is unfortunately difficult to do in a timely manner.

However, even unsophisticated cyber attacks such as DDoS and website defacements tend to garner widespread media exposure, and can sow distrust in the security of systems. This occurred during the invasion of Crimea, when Russia sought to
capitalise on events that unfolded far too quickly for methodical information analysis to take place.

Chapter 11

Missing in Action:
Rhetoric on Cyber Warfare
Liisa Past
NATO CCD COE

Introduction

In the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, there has been much talk of ‘hybrid warfare’,
encompassing every aspect of war including cyber operations. Much of cyber
operations is classified and hidden from public view, but there are numerous ways
in which information becomes known, including via intelligence leaks and open
source analysis. This chapter focuses on leadership communications and what they
can tell us about conflict in cyberspace.
In geopolitics, heads of state are the ultimate decision-makers, especially during
a national security crisis. Leaders are expected to show rhetorical as well as executive leadership. The media takes it from there, but the public still struggles to find
a consistent evaluation, primarily relying on experts and opinion leaders.1 As the
head of state seeks his or her ‘rally around the president’ moment,2 domestic and
international observers analyse their explanations and emotions – as well as their
proffered initiatives and guidance.3 From a national podium, heads of state have an
inherent advantage, as their arguments are ‘more likely to resonate with the public
than the opinions of leaders voicing a more local outlook’.4
Communication and discourse analysis in international affairs rests on the idea
that language cannot be taken at face value. Words carry definitional meaning, but dif1

ferent audiences will perceive them differently. Critical analysis can yield insight into
the true beliefs and motivations of any speaker, including policy-makers. Meaning is
‘mediated through language’5 and all words have ‘social values’6 that vary with context.
This chapter analyses Russian and Ukrainian leadership statements, speeches,
press releases and other rhetoric from 2014 and 2015, especially the English-language elements, written for a global audience and printed in international media.
The author also searched major international news outlets for the keywords
‘Ukraine’, ‘Russia’, ‘cyber’, and ‘information warfare’. In all cases, focus remained on
the rhetoric attributable to a head of state or other high-level political player,7 with
an eye toward uncovering their underlying motivations, beliefs, and ideologies.

Analytical Focus

This analysis is designed to yield insight into numerous areas of international concern. Above all, the world would like to understand more about the emerging threat
of cyber warfare. New developments in research and technology, as well as in the
means and methods of war, are usually far ahead of their codification in doctrine.
Computer network operations fit nicely within the concept of hybrid warfare that
has been so characteristic of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. Cyber attacks are similar to
covert operations, information operations, denial and deception, false flag and no-flag
attacks: they give national command and conAn analysis of political

ing challenges of cyber attacks: attribution.
Political leaders must appeal to the hearts and minds of their domestic and
international audiences, with the help of emotional and sometimes long-winded
speeches. National security establishments must provide legal support for their
actions through the release of press statements and promulgation of doctrine. With
these in hand, analysts may be able to understand much more about the otherwise covert nature of cyber attacks. In 2015, Russia has a fairly well-developed military doctrine on cyber and information warfare, while that of Ukraine is still in its
infancy. This analysis offers a deeper understanding of each nation’s non-explicit
political objectives related to cyber warfare.

Russia

Since the turn of the century, Russia has been publicly admiring European values
while simultaneously emphasising sovereignty and a strong national defence.8 Moscow insists that ‘each nation in the region should be given a right to experiment with
its own democratic model that fits its national and international conditions’.9 This
tension may only grow stronger with time, and we may see further Russian moves
away from shared values in the future as Moscow confronts not only Ukraine but
also the West more generally, including in Syria.
Regarding Ukraine, Russia insists it is a bystander and even a victim. Putin said,
‘There are still many threats and challenges in the world today. As you may know,
in Europe, militant nationalism is raising its head here and there – the one that once
led to the appearance of the Nazi ideology. I will not dwell on each of the hotspots
separately – we all know where the danger is. Incidentally, the situation in our
neighbouring brotherly Ukraine is an example of the disaster and loss such an irresponsible policy can bring about.’10 In explaining Gazprom’s tough stance vis-à-vis
Ukraine, for example, Putin has argued that there was no other choice but to take
a hard line against Kyiv,11 again placing Russia as a bystander, not an active party.
Putin has consistently delegitimised Poroshenko’s government:
‘There can only be one assessment: this was an anti-constitutional takeover,
an armed seizure of power [that] significantly destabilised the east and southeast of Ukraine […] we see the rampage of reactionary forces, nationalist
and anti-Semitic forces going on in certain parts of Ukraine, including Kyiv
[…] Are the current authorities legitimate? The Parliament is partially, but all
the others are not. The current Acting President is definitely not legitimate […]
one set of thieves [is] being replaced by another. […] We will not fight with
the Ukrainian people [but] I do not have a partner at the top level there’.12

Russia’s perspective, has not played a major role in the Ukraine conflict. There have
been some commercial reports alleging specific Russian cyber attacks, such as that
by the security firm FireEye,13 but these are typically dismissed as Western propaganda. According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, ‘We know that blaming
Russia for everything has turned into a sport’.14
Putin did refer to the stories about phone hacking and surveillance of top politicians, which were prominent in the news in 2014:
‘As for the facts of cyber espionage that you mentioned, it not only amounts to
overt hypocrisy in relationships between allies and partners, but also a direct
violation of the state’s sovereignty, an infringement on human rights and an
invasion of privacy. We are looking forward to jointly developing an international information security system’.15
This quote may indicate an underlying assumption of Russian doctrine: today,
everyone is spying on everyone, there are currently no acceptable international laws
to govern such activities in cyberspace, and Russia must be a part of any credible
effort to develop such norms.
Although Russia claims not to be directly involved in the Ukraine conflict, Moscow still wants to direct its peace-making efforts. Putin has championed a consideration of Ukraine’s eastern regions16 has produced a diplomatic solution called the
Putin Plan17 and ‘gave the instruction to hold consultations with foreign partners,
including the IMF and the G8 countries, on organising financial assistance for
Ukraine’.18

of Ukraine’, and ‘cyber and information security’.21 These terms may refer to
slightly different things at different times, but in general, there was more cyber warfare-related content to analyse.
From the beginning of the conflict, Ukraine has suffered a variety of network
attacks. In February 2014, the Ukrainian telecommunications firm Ukrtelecom
reported that ‘unknown people’22 had damaged a fibre backbone cable that resulted
in the loss of communication between Crimea and the rest of Ukraine. Not long
after, Ukrainian security chief Valentyn Nalivaichenko announced, ‘I confirm that
an ... attack is under way on mobile phones of members of the Ukrainian parliament for the second day in a row’.23 The most sophisticated attack came against the
Ukrainian Central Election Commission (CEC) during Ukraine’s Presidential elections.24 However, there was no official attribution for any of these attacks provided
by the government in Kyiv.
There were at least two cases of cyber attack attribution, both to Russia. The
Security Service of Ukraine linked the disruption of mobile communications and
the defacement of websites to pro-Russian hackers and to pro-Russian forces in
Crimea. There was no direct link made to Moscow, perhaps in part because the
‘IP-telephonic’ attack was aimed at top Ukrainian politicians irrespective of their
political allegiance.25 On another occasion, when the hacktivist group CyberBerkut
claimed responsibility for an attack on German government websites, Ukrainian
Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk placed the blame on Russian intelligence: ‘I
strongly recommend that the Russian secret services stop spending taxpayer money
for cyberattacks against the Bundestag and Chancellor Merkel’s office’.26

cepted a conversation in which one of the leaders of the mercenaries boasted about
bringing down the plane in his reporting to his Russian supervisor, a colonel of the
General Intelligence Unit of Russia’s Armed Forces’28 and ‘terrorists have already
declared their desire to hide the evidence and transport the aircraft’s black boxes to
Moscow’.29
In eastern Ukraine, Poroshenko contends that the separatist movement is ‘fully
controlled’ by Russian leadership30 and even in government-controlled territory, he
announced that ‘[t]he Security Service of Ukraine unmasked and neutralised the
terrorist group coordinated by special forces of the Russian Federation’.31
To international audiences, Poroshenko has focused primarily on the broader
topic of hybrid warfare, taking care to fit within the narratives and terminology
of the West. At the 2015 Munich Security
Conference, he said that ‘[f]or over a year

threats. […] Today, a former strategic
partner is waging a hybrid war against a sovereign state, a co-founder of the United
Nations. Mounds of lies and propaganda have been heaped into a wall of hatred,
erected between two once friendly nations’.32 While analysts have yet to agree on a
common definition of hybrid warfare, it certainly encompasses Internet-based propaganda, information operations, and computer hacking.
Looking toward the future, Poroshenko has positioned himself as a ‘President of
Peace’33 ‘on the forefront of the global fight for democracy’.34 Russia is the clear antagonist: ‘all military threats and challenges are related to Russia,’35 and Moscow’s war
‘has brought Ukraine to the brink of its survival’.36 Poroshenko argues that not just
Ukraine, but the whole world needs a resolution to this conflict,37 and that ‘democracies must support each other’.38 Ultimately, Ukraine’s national security goal is ‘full

NATO membership’.39 The President asserted that ‘Ukraine is not a NATO member
now. Unfortunately, we are not allies de jure. Yet, de facto we are more than just
partners … Ukraine is the eastern outpost of Euro-Atlantic civilisation, which is
now defending not only sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of our
country.’40

The Role of Non-state Actors

In the cyber domain, non-state, sometimes anonymous actors can play a significant
role in any conflict. During the Ukraine crisis, numerous groups such as CyberBerkut have positioned themselves as independent, Internet-based guerrillas, and
to some degree they have influenced the course of events. In general, there is too
little public information available for analysts to determine if any of these non-state
actors has a direct or indirect government connection.
In Ukraine, one of the most prominent non-state cyber leaders is Eugene
Dokunin, who describes himself as a ‘lone wolf waging a furious battle against the
thousands of paid hackers and trolls in Russia’.41 Whereas governments may not
boast about their achievements, rogue actors do. Dokunin’s group claims to have
blocked more than 170 PayPal and other online accounts belonging to separatists,
and frozen almost $3 million of their cash. In one attack, they compromised networked printers in separatist regions, forcing them to spew out documents glorifying Ukraine, as well as the popular chant ‘Putin is a dick’, which is sung in football
stadiums across Ukraine’.42 Dokunin reserves some of his ire for the sitting government in Kyiv: ‘The Ukrainian Government hasn’t invested a cent in cyber warfare,
even though this is also an information war’.

Conclusion

Communication analysis reveals that both Putin and Poroshenko have adopted
similar rhetorical strategies – ‘good vs. evil’ and ‘us vs. them’ – in an effort to rally
citizens around the flag. They emphasise the righteous nature of their cause, their
leadership in working toward a solution, and other countries’ approval of their
political stances. This is an exercise in national identity building, while portraying
the adversary as illegitimate, dangerous, and even terrorist in nature. To resolve the

strategy to the West and to NATO. Russia
has focussed on national interests, while
Ukraine has appealed to the international
community for understanding and support.
Even while Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a modern, ‘hot’ military
conflict, its leaders have shed very little light on cyber warfare. Russia has referred to
it only in high-level, diplomatic terms. Ukraine, despite the fact that it has suffered
numerous cyber attacks, primarily frames the issue within the larger concept of
hybrid warfare. Neither country denies that cyberspace is now a theatre of warfare,
or that it is part of the Ukrainian conflict, but neither has argued that cyberspace is
an integral aspect of it. And for the most part, this echoes the sentiments of other
authors and chapters in this volume.

Introduction

The new information environment has changed the nature of warfare. The events
in south-east Ukraine have demonstrated that a conflict can be won without firing
a single shot and some of the key battles can take place in the cyber and communications domains rather than on the land,
air and sea. As Thomas Elkjer Nissen said
Key battles can take place in

ple and organisations. Such tactics may be
employed in isolation, but they are much
more likely to be an integral part of a larger strategy.1
The operation for the take-over of Crimea was a particularly bold example of
an influence operation where the traditional role of conventional forces was mini1

mised. As the conflict continues to develop in the east of Ukraine, Russia continues
to exploit the opportunities offered by new technologies and the new information
environment. It does so with the purpose of influencing the hearts and minds of its
audiences: if Russia succeeds in mobilising its supporters, demonising its enemy,
demoralising its enemy’s government and armed forces, and legitimising its own
actions, then really there is no need for conventional fighting in order to subdue
Ukraine.
In the modern-day operations cyberspace plays an increasingly important role.
A targeted attack by an adversary in the cyber environment is often understood as
an attack on the computerised systems which help us run our daily lives and businesses, sustain critical infrastructure and conduct financial transactions amongst
other things. As the former White House advisor Richard Clarke writes, a cyber-attack can mean that these vital systems go down and we see exploding oil refineries,
derailing trains, runaway satellites, food shortages, and much more.2 But what we
do not often realise is that we can be attacked in the cyber environment by an adversary presenting manipulative information to us with the intent to affect our perception of the situation and our decision-making, and provoke some resulting action.
The real-life consequences of this ‘soft’ cyber-attack can be as severe as an attack on
a critical infrastructure.

2

Strategic Communications and Cyberspace

Strategic Communications (StratCom) is a mind-set which implies placing communications at the heart of a strategy. It means that our activity is narrative-driven and
we communicate it to different audiences through coordinated words, images and
deeds. Cyberspace plays an increasingly important role in StratCom as our dependency on modern technologies, computer networks and the internet grows day by
day. We use it for receiving and conveying information, for coordinating our actions
and also for analysing the environment around us in order to detect and evaluate
potential threats.
Cyberspace is often used in a conflict in order to take out the communications
systems of an adversary. However, the conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated that
cyberspace can also play a role in conducting a narrative-driven operation where
the main targets are not the machines or networks but the minds of the people.
The internet and social media, due to their ability to multiply information at
high speed and at little cost, are increasingly used for propaganda, information warfare, and influence operations, all of which can tangibly change both the perception
and behaviour of the target audience. It is a highly dynamic, user-driven, constantly
changing environment where it is easy to get a message to ‘go viral’, and also difficult

to track the initial source of information, verify its authenticity, and separate fact
from fiction.
With the increasing popularity of social media platforms, the concept of social
cyber attack is gaining traction.3 It allows for a low-cost, speedy way of manipulating society’s perceptions in order to cause disruptive behaviour in real life. The
social cyber attacks observed during the crisis in Ukraine led to an assumption that
at least part of them were implemented in an organised way, as part of a larger influence strategy.

3

Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) and Social Media

Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) is a military activity which is aimed at influencing the perceptions, attitudes and behaviours of target populations. The perception
is usually affected by either emotional appeals or rational arguments, corresponding
to the master narrative, and in social media, where one has to compete with a flood
of information and large amounts of information noise, elements like surprise, cognitive dissonance, easily recognisable symbols or some eye-catching techniques are
used in order to draw the audience into the PSYOPS product.
In PSYOPS the influence over a target group is often achieved by spreading
rumours. Those can be:
• Hate rumours: exploit ingrained dislikes and prejudices
of a target population.
• Fear rumours: exploit a human tendency to believe the worst.
• Hope rumours: exploit wishes for a favourable turn of events.
Modern technology allows particularly easy exploitation of digital material in
order to produce falsified or ambiguous content which can be used for deception
and manipulation. Textual messages (posts, status updates, comments) can also be
crafted according to the same principles.
Social media provides fruitful soil for PSYOPS as it is largely a trust-based network since it is formed on a networks of friends or like-minded group members.
Hence the information coming from an individual or group can be more trusted
than that coming from an official mass-media outlet or government communicators. This trust can be manipulated to achieve particular effects. It allows targeting
of groups of people connected by certain social ties which increases the chance of
the desired effect on perception and behaviour.
It is also very easy to hide the real identity or original source of information on
social media as well as manipulate digital data such as imagery. Hence the concept
3

Research, 2013.

of social cyber attack becomes increasingly important as it is based on manipulated
information being spread under false identities to networks of users.

4

Understanding Social Cyber Attacks

A social cyber attack, as defined by Dr Rebecca Goolsby, involves acting under false
pretences or anonymously, by either releasing a manipulated signal into the social
media or by manipulating an existing signal in order to achieve the desired effects:
chaos, panic, mass disorders. This type of cyber attack offers a different view to the
traditional views on attacks in the cyber environment, as the effects of these attacks
are purely psychological.
Spreading rumours is one of the most effective tactics of the social cyber attack,
as those can create fear, hate or unfounded hope in the target audience which
will most likely result in real-life action:
for example, mass protests, withdrawing

has been portrayed as the enemy.4
Social cyber attack can also involve
traditional hacking if the information to be manipulated and released needs to be
obtained or published this way. Since the concept of the social cyber attack is very
new, it is often difficult to determine what activity should be classified as one. One
might argue that the key component to social cyber attack is the narrative which
drives it. The actions by the pro-Russian ‘Cyber Berkut’ (КиберБеркут) and its
nemesis, the pro-Ukrainian ‘Cyber Hundred’ (Киберсотня) can serve as examples.
Cyber Berkut is frequently in the news, propagating the Russian political narrative as well as hacking both the Ukrainian Government and other countries. The
group successfully attacked and defaced the websites of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE), claiming that its activities were in retaliation for NATO
support for Ukraine.5 However, the key to Cyber Berkut’s activities is the narrative
which it uses to justify and promote its activities. Cyber Berkut claimed credit on its
social networking site VKontakte page for hacking electronic advertising billboards
in the centre of Kyiv prior to a Ukrainian parliamentary election on 24 October
2014, displaying videos of numerous prominent Ukrainian politicians and labelling
them war criminals:2
[English translation] ‘We Cyber Berkut intend to use every opportunity to
defend the interests of Ukrainian citizens from the arbitrariness of nationalist

fringe and the oligarchic elite …Today, we have used a few dozen billboards
in Kyiv, Ukraine to remind people about the futility of farcical elections …We
reiterate once again that no one will change our lives for us. If the people will
continue to hope that the authorities in the offices there are people concerned
about the problems of ordinary citizens, Ukraine will be more immersed in
the chaos of civil war. The United States and the West first brought into the
government people who are ready to sell our country to please their owners,
and now want to put the same traitors in Parliament. Today, everyone has to
realise that his decision depends the future of our country, and the sooner we
crack down on neo-Nazi government and deputies, who are just cashing in
on this war, the sooner the country’s peace and order.’
This narrative was also spread on social media networks. Analysing this statement, one can identify clear attempts to construe enemy images of the Ukrainian
Government and induce fear in the population by calling it neo-Nazi and threatening chaos and civil war. The hacking of the billboards had no other meaning than to
conduct a social cyber attack by propagating this narrative and spreading rumours
through manipulated information.

Social Media in the Russian-Ukrainian Conflict

During the war in Ukraine, social media has become home to intense conflict-related information updates, impassioned arguments, and debate.6 The social media
space has been abused, and pro-Russian forces have given the world a masterclass.
At the beginning of the conflict, we saw strategic communications in action.
Over Twitter and YouTube, unknown attackers released an intercepted phone conversation between the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.7 In one stroke, the perpetrators sought
to discredit Western policy and to announce their access to Western lines of government communication. Thus we saw both a technical exploit on an information
system and a psychological attack on the West via social media.
During the course of the conflict, Russia’s narrative has been tightly scripted and
disseminated, both on traditional media (in ‘breaking’ and ‘eyewitness’ accounts on
television) and in cyberspace via social media. These venues are mutually reinforcing,
encompassing older and younger readers with varying degrees of access to technology. For example, one can no longer watch Ukrainian television in eastern Ukraine;
similarly, Russian television channels are no longer available in western Ukraine.

On social media, pro-Russian voices have systemically cultivated fear, anxiety,
and hate among the ethnically Russian (and other non-Ukrainian populations) of
Ukraine. They have manipulated and distributed images of purported atrocities by
the Ukrainian army, including: mass graves of tortured people, civilians used for
organ trafficking, burning crops to create a famine, recruiting child soldiers, the use
of heavy weapons against civilians, and acts of cannibalism.8
Via social media, such information – whether offered with some evidence or
merely in the form of rumours – often criss-crosses the globe in minutes, and a
well-organised social media campaign can easily influence a target population’s perceptions and behaviours.
The Latvian media company LETA conducted an analysis of Twitter posts during
the first six months of 2014, and identified an increasing polarisation between
pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian social media users as the conflict escalated, especially following the violence in Odessa.9 The researchers wrote that 12.2% of all
tweets related to the conflict in eastern Ukraine were ‘aggressive’, dominated by
pro-Russian stances, most intense relative to human casualties, and included epithets such as ‘fascist’ and ‘ruscist’.10

The Russian-language social networking website Vkontakte saw more than 5,000
shares of this post within 24 hours, and it was quickly translated into English, German, and Bulgarian. However, analysts subsequently discovered that Dr. Rozovskiy’s profile picture was actually that of a dentist from the North Caucasus, and now
believe this social media post to be a hoax.11
On 4 June 2014, Pavel Astakhov, the Children’s Ombudsman under the President
of the Russian Federation, announced on his Instagram account that ‘more than 7,000’
Ukrainian refugees had fled Ukraine and arrived in the Rostov Oblast in the previous
24 hours. The next day, that number had risen to 8,386. Russian mass media reported
these numbers, but Rostov authorities apparently contradicted them, where the Governor’s office reported that the number of refugees did not exceed 712.12
In July 2014, 3-year-old boy was allegedly tortured and crucified by the Ukrainian
military in a public square in Slovyansk, Ukraine. The Russian state-run TV Channel
One broadcast the ‘eyewitness’ testimony of Galina Pyshnyak, who stated that she and
others were forcibly brought to the central square to witness the public execution. The
interview took place at a refugee camp in Russia’s Rostov region and was widely disseminated on social media.13 However, Russian journalist Yevgeny Feldman of Novaya
Gazeta, as well as journalists from Russia’s independent channel Dozhd, challenged
the report with contradictory testimonies from multiple interviews in Slovyank, in
which numerous residents denied any knowledge of the incident.14
Throughout 2014, the list of rumours from eastern Ukraine grew to be quite
long: the Kyiv government and European Union were building concentration
camps; the forest was full of right-wing killers; the May 9 Victory Day holiday had
been cancelled;15 property would be confiscated; and use of the Russian language
was prohibited. On one occasion, terrified locals called the Donbas Water Company
after social media informed them that the region’s water supply had been poisoned.16
These stories can be contrasted with the ‘Polite People’ campaign on Vkontakte,
which supported the Russian invasion of Crimea with pictures of Russian troops
posing alongside girls, mothers with children, the elderly, and pets.17

Troll Farming

Who tweets in support of politics? Who posts Facebook updates in support of
military operations? Of course, there are millions of true believers in the world,
adherents to every cause under the sun. However, it is also possible to fabricate
support for anything, especially in cyberspace. The social media offers great
opportunities for state and non-state actors to use fake identities or automatically generated accounts to disseminate their narrative to audiences as widely
as possible.
On 24 May 2014, hacked and leaked email correspondence (revealed on b0ltai.
org) allegedly from a company called the ‘Internet Research Agency’ in St. Petersburg, Russia, offered evidence of the existence of a professional ‘troll farm’, including
the firm’s relationship to the Russian Government. Media reports suggested that
recruitment of employees had occurred prior to the onset of military operations,
and that workers were tasked with writing 100 internet posts per day.18
For strategic communications, these developments are critical to understanding modern information operations including disinformation and PSYOPS, as a
well-orchestrated social media campaign could significantly affect the prevailing
political narrative.
It is possible to analyse the social media domain in an effort to separate fact
from fiction, to investigate when accounts were created, whether they have credible
content or a real networks of real friends, but to do this accurately and in a timely
manner is an extraordinary challenge for anyone, including law enforcement and
counterintelligence organisations.19

some examples of social media commentary from Crimea: that its incorporation
into Russia has led to safety and stability on the Crimean peninsula.
The use of cyberspace both to attack the infrastructure and to influence ‘people’s hearts and minds’ is a new phenomenon that has been increasingly used in
recent conflicts to support military operations on the ground. This kind of warfare
will not disappear; on the contrary the combination of actions which are targeted
at infrastructure and human psychology will be used in more sophisticated and
unpredictable ways in the future. A three step approach could be recommended for
security experts and national decision makers to prepare better to meet these kind
of challenges:
Identify. Governments and defence organisations should enhance
their capabilities to identify the detrimental use of social media. Information campaigns which entail propaganda and automated or fake
accounts to rapidly disseminate information should be closely monitored and analysed. This also includes additional efforts in order to
understand how these campaigns are organised and what effects they
can have on public perception.
Challenge. Examples by citizen journalists have shown that revealing
false facts to the public is an effective approach in mitigating the effects
of disinformation. At the same time it is important not to engage in
counter-propaganda as this fuels the information war and creates
public distrust rather than diminishing the power of misinformation.
Humour perhaps could be more helpful in countering aggressive propaganda as it hampers the ability to achieve its aim – subduing the
society of the target country. The initiatives in Twitter like @DarthPutinKGB or @Sputnik_Intl are good examples of how to challenge
Russia’s disinformation campaign with irony and jokes.
Learn and prepare. The development of the unifying strategic narrative – the story which entails the set of the values and beliefs of
your country or organisation – is the best defence against propaganda
which questions them. A long-term educational effort to enhance critical thinking and media (including social media) literacy would also
contribute greatly to society’s self-defence against manipulation.

Ukraine: A Cyber Safe Haven?

Introduction

Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a proliferation in online criminal
activity in Eastern Europe, and Ukraine is no exception. Famous for its hacker community, Ukraine ranks among the Top 10 countries in the world in cyber crime1 and
number 15 as a source of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.2 In 2012,
five Ukrainian nationals stole more than $72 million from U.S. bank accounts;3 in
2013, Ukrainian hackers stole 40 million sets of debit and credit card details from
the US retail chain Target;4 in 2014, the RAND Corporation wrote that Russian
and Ukrainian (the primary language of Ukraine) were the lingua franca of online
hacker forums.5 In this light, it is natural to wonder if Ukraine is today a safe haven
for cyber criminals.
To be sure, there have been some law enforcement successes, such as when
numerous European countries and Europol (with the aid of the Ukrainian government) arrested five hackers who stole at least €2 million from banks all around the
world.6 However, there are major countervailing factors at play in Ukraine, which
include ongoing political, military, and economic crises and the absence of zhyvoii

Ukraine as a Cyber Safe Haven

Once the internet conquered post-Soviet daily life, many talented computer programmers who had already dabbled in illegal activities such as stealing music and
movies realised that they could make a living as professional hackers. There were
few cyber security regulations in Ukraine and so, as in so many other countries,
cyber crime quickly evolved from a mischievous hobby to a lucrative occupation.8
Several factors contributed to making Ukraine a cyber safe haven. First, its
Soviet school STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education
is among the best in the world. Second, its underwhelming economic performance
since independence in 1991 has led these STEM specialists to explore alternative
career paths, often online. Third, Ukraine’s social and cultural norms dictate that
stealing from the West is not always a bad thing. This factor is compounded by the
relatively impersonal nature of cyberspace.9
At the policy level, ‘cyber crimes’ such as stealing intellectual property and
copyright infringement were not even considered illegal in Ukraine until recently.
For instance, the popular Russian social media website vkontakte.ru used to be
a source of large-scale music and movie piracy.10 Ukraine recently has begun to
develop a common lexicon on cyber security (a pre-requisite for progress in this

new domain),11 but the multiple cyber units within the Ukrainian government12 still
tend to operate independently, and rarely collaborate.13 Moreover, as in other Eastern European countries, government employees are poorly paid and lack resources,
which in turn motivates skilled specialists to leave for the private sector. Finally, due
to the high level of corruption in Ukraine, even when a cyber criminal is caught, he
or she can usually bribe an official to have the charges reduced or dropped.14

Ukraine as a Cyber Target

Even though Ukraine is not a rich country and is relatively new to online banking,
its enterprises nonetheless lost ₴65 million15 to cybercrime in 2014.16 The origin of
these attacks is unclear, but numerous interviewees agreed that the cyber criminals
were not physically located in Ukraine. Most likely, they would follow the hacker’s first ‘zapovid’’ (‘commandment’), the so-called ‘gypsy’ rule: ‘tam de zhyvesh,
tam ne kradesh’ (‘you do not steal in the place where you live’).17 When asked
whether Russia could be a source of such attacks, Vlad Styran, an information
security consultant at Berezha Security, answered affirmatively, but explained that
some groups originally operating from Russia have moved to Ukraine, mostly to
the self-proclaimed Donetsk National Republic (DNR) and the Luhansk National
Republic (LNR).18 However, these groups may not be attacking Ukraine directly,
but Western countries farther afield, similar to online criminals in Romania, Turkey, and Belarus.19 In Ukraine, the domestic climate, technical capabilities, and
resources are better suited to criminals who engage in credit card fraud,20 and
as long as they steal money in small amounts, no one will touch them.21 Cyber
criminals physically based in Ukraine have also begun to look for more comfortable conditions in which to operate, as Ukrainian law enforcement agencies have
begun to collaborate with Western agencies.22 Thus the number of cyber criminals
in Ukraine may finally be declining.23
The conflict in eastern Ukraine has given rise to numerous high-level cyber
attacks. As part of its military operations, Russia has used cyber warfare tactics against
Ukrainian websites, some of which are physically hosted in Ukraine, while some are

that Russia conducted cyber operations to support its Crimea conquest.25 Independent researchers also discovered a cyber espionage operation called Armageddon
that was designed to provide a ‘military advantage to Russian leadership by targeting
Ukrainian government and law enforcement agencies’,26 and included DDoS attacks
against Ukrainian and NATO media outlets, and targeted attacks against Ukrainian
election commission websites.27 In all, hackers hit Ukrainian government, business,
online media, and e-commerce sites.28 Finally, it should be noted in this context that
Ukraine’s information and telecommunication networks generally use Russian hardware and software, a situation that would significantly help Russia to spy on its southern neighbour.29

Ukraine’s Cyber Security Agenda

While cyber crime has flourished in Ukraine, the same cannot be said for the development of Kyiv’s cyber security policy, which is simply not currently a high priority.
In Ukraine, only 41.8% of the population is now online, compared to 84.2% in the
United States and 61.4% in Russia.30 Furthermore, the majority of Ukrainian internet

‘On Data Protection in Information and Telecommunication Systems,’ ‘On the National

Protection of Ukraine.’ In 2012, Parliament began to propose amendments to these laws.
Today, there is an increasing focus on cyber crime awareness, and the government is in
the process of creating a new ministry devoted to information technology (IT).

Victor Zhora, CEO and Co-Founder at Infosafe IT LLC, contends that a major
problem with existing Ukrainian legislation is the lack of a clear definition for cyber
crime. The only operational definition is in Article 361 of the Criminal Codex of
Ukraine: ‘Illegal interference with the operation of computers (PCs), automated
systems, computer networks or telecommunications networks’.31 However, it is not
clear what ‘illegal interference’ actually means.
Recently, lawmakers have considered new legislation – the ‘Cybersecurity Law of
Ukraine’ – which seeks to: update existing laws; create conditions for cooperation between
the private and publics sectors; protect critical information infrastructure; develop a comprehensive legal framework; build a secure national security network; educate future
specialists; fight cyber crime and cyber terrorism; strengthen the state’s defence in cyberspace; prevent other states from interfering in Ukraine’s internal affairs; neutralise attacks
on Ukraine’s information resources; and ensure Ukraine’s full participation in European
and regional cybersecurity organisations. 32 However, such a comprehensive agenda faces
numerous acute challenges before it can be properly implemented.33
For example, ‘the strategy of creating a secure national segment of cyberspace’ lacks a
working definition of critical national infrastructure (CNI), as well as a valid list of CNI.
At this stage in Ukraine’s economic development, there is little CNI with internet-based
management, but that number is beginning to rise.34 Another example is ‘ensuring full
participation of Ukraine in European and regional systems’. Although Ukrainian cyber
security experts already share information and intelligence with Western colleagues, this
collaboration is not nearly as effective as it could
For the foreseeable future,

It is debatable, given the ongoing war in

especially given that all countries are currently struggling to protect CNI. Even if adopted, the draft Cybersecurity Law of
Ukraine will take years to fully implement.36 Therefore, for the foreseeable future,
Ukrainian CNI such as telecoms,37 banks,38 and insurance companies39 will rely on
reasonably sound private sector approaches to their cyber security challenges.40

Its implementation has three stages: 1) 2014-2016; 2) 2016-2017; and 3) 2017 – the following years.
Telecom operators are mostly protected as a huge portion of the population uses these services. They do no necessarily suffer
from cyber attacks but they suffer from their clients’ abuse of the system. From supra, note 7.
Banks are in second place in terms of protection and in first place in terms of damage.. It is quite a new trend in Ukraine as banks
mostly operate using their clients’ money. Last year, we witnessed the first cyber attacks on Ukrainian banks. From supra, note 7.
Insurance companies take the third place on the level of protection. They are active in protecting their companies from cyber
attacks not because they are subjects to those attacks, but mostly because they are part of some international group, which
requires them to follow the EU or U.S. requirements or because they need to create their image. Supra, note 7.

with the SBU, which does not focus on external affairs, a crucial element in locating international hackers.43 Glib Pakharenko, the ISACA Kyiv Chapter membership
director, said: ‘When NATO meets with various cyber forces in Ukraine, they only
observe how these forces fight with each other and blame each other for failures’.44
SSSCIP is the only organisation that works exclusively on cyber security issues.
Its main activities include: ‘interaction with the administration domain UA.; protection of state information resources; interaction with state authorities; international
cooperation in the protection of information resources; unified antivirus protection
system; and determining the level of protection of information and telecommunication authorities’ systems.’45 SSSCIP has numerous internal offices, including the
Centre for Antivirus Information Protection (CAIP),46 the Assessment of Protection
of State Information Resources, the Cybernetic Protection System, and the Registry

of Information and Telecommunication Authorities’ Systems. Its Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) handles international cooperation.
Each agency faces its own unique challenges and suffers from its own, unique
criticism. For example, one interviewee said of CERT-UA: ‘[its specialists] just visit
Europe and tell [the Europeans] how amazing they are. They [only] do PR and make
contacts in Ukraine and abroad.’47 Others, however, disagreed, arguing that in 2013
CERT-UA processed 232 incident reports
from foreign CERTs48 and was ‘quite effective’

added that CERT-UA’s bigger problem is the
country’s almost exclusive current focus on fighting Russian aggression in eastern
Ukraine.50
At the MVD, Vasyl Guzii, a specialist in kartkove shakhraistvo (credit card fraud
operations), asserted that no ‘sdelka iz pravosudiiem’ (‘deal with law enforcement agencies’ in Russian) exists in Ukraine.51 However, Styran was not so sure, suggesting that
‘verbyvannia’ (‘recruitment’) was common.52 In effect, this means that instead of arresting hackers, law enforcement agencies simply offer krysha (protection)53 in exchange
for future favours.54 The overall level of corruption in Ukraine is high, even at the SBU.55
Despite everything, there is progress to report. Beyond the new draft law on
cyber security and the proposed new IT ministry56 Ukraine is setting up an Interagency Board57 to counter strategic cyber threats (see Figure 1‑2). This initiative will
of course take time to blossom, and there are already doubts about technical talent,
bureaucratic implementation, and overall SBU power in this new initiative.58 So, for
the time being, it is likely that the Ukrainian government will continue to rely on
an approach favoured in the United Kingdom: pereklastu or delegating many cyber
crime-related tasks, including client protection, to the private sector.59

Recommendations

The following ‘best practices’ could significantly strengthen Ukraine’s cyber security
posture for the future.
6.1 National
• Metrics. Analysts believe that cyber crime is rife in Ukraine, but there
are no accurate measurements or reliable studies that have documented this problem. Some Western60 and Ukrainian companies61 are
now addressing this issue, but without better data and analysis, it is
hard to separate fact from fiction.
• Prevention. Until Ukraine invests more in proactive cyber defence,
it will remain in a reactive mode vis-à-vis cyber criminals, a serious
problem in the age of light-speed communications.

• Corruption. Ukraine must address bribes, protection,62 and the unethical recruitment of hackers. In one infamous case, a fraudulent cyber
crime ‘call centre’, which in fact was used to steal credit card information, actually operated from a Ukrainian prison.63
• Culture. Ukraine must promote cyber crime awareness and enforce
existing law. Ukrainian citizens must recognise that stealing money
from the West is against the law, and they must be willing to report
such crimes to law enforcement.64
• Education. Kyiv must invest in the academic side of cyber security, to
include software engineering, critical infrastructure protection, and
more.65 Some steps have already been taken, including the creation
of kiberpolitseiski (cyber police) departments at the Kyiv and Kharkiv
MVD Institutes;66 further, the MVD has collaborated with various
departments of the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI). The Science Park
of the KPI promotes science-intensive products on domestic and foreign markets that provide better cybersecurity solutions. 67,68
• Civil Society. The Ukrainian Government requires pressure from below
to assist in the implementation of so many needed changes. Even from
abroad, the Ukrainian diaspora can help.
• Oversight. Ukrainian lawmakers often receive foreign assistance to
help the country adopt and implement reform, but currently there is
no effective oversight body helping to manage this process.69
• Public sector labour force. The Ukrainian government must find a
way to hire qualified cyber security professionals and retain them with
quality training and attractive salaries. It must be said that this challenge is not unique to Ukraine.70
6.2 Regional and International
• Collaboration. Ukrainian cyber security institutions must develop a
higher level of trust with their international counterparts, especially in
the West. This begins with practical cooperation on current high-interest criminal cases, to include resource and information sharing. In the
past, such collaboration has not always been effective, and sometimes
never occurred at all.71 Points of departure include Mutual Legal Assis62

tance Treaties (MLAT) and the European Convention on Cybercrime
which Ukraine ratified in 2005.
• Western Assistance. Most of the digital equipment in Ukraine was
manufactured in Russia, so there is an urgent need for EU and NATO
nations to assist Ukraine in replacing it. Some concrete steps have
already been taken: NATO has allocated funds for Ukraine’s ‘cyber
defences, command and control structures, and logistics capabilities’;72
Microsoft announced a partnership with the Ukrainian Government on cyber security;73 U.S. Senators Mark Kirk and Mark Warner
announced a ‘bipartisan amendment creating a law enforcement partnership between the United States and Ukraine to combat cybercrime
and improve cybersecurity’;74 and Romania launched an initiative to
support the Ukraine Cyber Defence Trust Fund.75
• Cyber security strategy. Ukraine must harmonise its cyber security policies and legislation with those of the most technologically advanced
members of the international community. The European Network and
Information Security Agency (ENISA) has a strong record of providing guidance in cyber security policy development and best practices;
Ukraine should take full advantage of this resource.

Conclusion

Ukraine, with its talented hackers and minimal cyber security regulations, is a perfect case study to examine the many challenges that Eastern European countries
face as they seek to improve their cyber security posture. Ukraine has more than enough

A Legal Framework
for Cyber Operations
in Ukraine

Introduction

Do the cyber attacks that we have seen during the Ukraine conflict constitute cyberwar? This chapter considers this question from a legal perspective. The term ‘cyberwar’ has no precise legal meaning. Even the term ‘war’ is less important than it used
to be. Contemporary international law distinguishes ‘armed conflict’, ‘armed attack’,
and ‘use of force’, but the question is how to place cyber conflict into that framework. In Ukraine, are we seeing ‘cyber armed conflict’ or merely cyber crime?
Cyber operations have to be considered within the context of the whole conflict.
Although cyber can be used as stand-alone operation, the more likely case – and
this holds true in Ukraine – is that cyber is used as a facilitator for other, more
traditional types of warfare. The law applicable to the conflict as a whole should
be applied to the cyber activities that are part of it. In other words, the wider context determines the legal framework for cyber operations. Particularly relevant is
whether the conflict in Ukraine is an ‘armed conflict’ that leads to the application of
the Law of Armed Conflict (or international humanitarian law).
This chapter will first briefly outline the applicability of international law to
cyberspace. Then it will describe the legal framework of the conflict, related to the
subsequent phases of the conflict, from the protests at Maidan Square in November
2013 to the present day. After that, the associated cyber activities will be placed in
this legal context.

International Law and Cyber Operations

The applicability of international law to cyberspace has long been debated. Most
Western countries posit that existing international law applies. Some countries,
such as China and Russia, have proposed a unique and separate set of norms.1
Today, it is generally recognised that international law applies, which is illustrated
by the 2013 report of the Governmental Group of Experts, established by the United
Nations (UN) General Assembly. It states that ‘International law, and in particular
the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace
and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.’2 However, the better question now concerns exactly how to apply international law in the cyber domain, and this is not a debate that will be resolved in
the near future.3 NATO ‘recognises that international law, including international
humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace’.4 It also considers
cyber defence to be an intrinsic part of its collective defence task, and has declared
that a cyber attack could have the impact as harmful as a conventional armed attack,
which could lead to the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.5
In this chapter, the author takes as a premise that existing international law
applies to cyberspace.

3.1 Euromaidan (November 2013 – February 2014)
A few weeks before the European Union (EU) Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, on 27-28 November 2013, during which the Ukraine – EU Association Agreement was to be signed, tensions in Ukraine were rising between those in
favour and those opposed to closer relations with the EU. On 21 November, President Viktor Yanukovych decided to abandon the Association Agreement. This was
followed by massive pro-EU demonstrations in Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kyiv. The clashes with the authorities grew violent. By mid-February, the events had escalated significantly, and had taken over 100 lives.
Before the Euromaidan protests began, tensions in Ukraine had already triggered hostile activity in cyberspace. Politically motivated hacker groups launched
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and other cyber attacks against a wide range
of targets. On 28 October, the hacker group ‘Anonymous Ukraine’ started ‘Operation Independence’ (#OpIndependence), favouring Ukraine’s independence from
any external influence, including the EU, NATO, and Russia.6 Operation Independence included DDoS attacks and website defacements against both Western and
Russian sites. During Euromaidan DDoS attacks and defacements against both
sides continued. Information leaks were used for propaganda purposes. Operation
Independence leaked emails from opposition leader Vitali Klitchko and his political
party, the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms. Unknown hackers leaked
the U.S. officials’ phone call which included the infamous statement, ‘f*ck the EU.’7
3.1.1 Legal Analysis
The Euromaidan protests were the violent culmination of a conflict between government authorities and pro-Western, civilian groups. Although the controversy
was about Ukraine’s external relations, it was primarily an internal matter between
a state and an opposition within that state. And while the conflict engendered considerable violence – one only has to look at the number of casualties – at that stage,
it could not be seen as an ‘armed conflict’. It was not a conflict with ‘armed forces on
either side engaged in hostilities [...] similar to an international war’.8 The incidents
had the character of internal disturbances, civilian uprising, and violent clashes
between protesters and police.
3.2 Forming Interim Government and Annexation of Crimea (February – March 2014)
On 21 February, President Yanukovych fled to Russia, and an Interim Government
was formed, uniting the opposition. Events unfolded rapidly in Crimea. Pro-Russian gunmen seized key government buildings. On 1 March, the upper house of the
Russian Parliament approved the deployment of troops in Ukraine to protect the

Russian speaking minority. Russian military forces (coined ‘little green men’) were
reportedly present in Crimea and blocked the positions of Ukrainian troops.9 A
referendum, initiated by the Crimean Parliament, was held in Crimea on 16 March,
which declared that 97% of voters supported joining Russia. Two days later, President Vladimir Putin signed a bill declaring Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation.10 These events were crucial in setting the stage for the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and led to a dramatic change in relations between Russia and the West.
In cyberspace, there was a simultaneous rise in malicious activity during the military operations in Crimea. Operations were conducted against Ukraine’s mobile
infrastructure, the mobile phones of members of the Ukrainian Parliament, and security communications. Some traditional methods were used, including the seizure of
Ukrtelecom offices and the physical cutting of telephone and internet cables.11 Digital
attacks included DDoS targeting Ukrainian, Crimean, NATO, and Russian websites.
The pro-Russian hacker group CyberBerkut was particularly active against NATO,12
while groups like OpRussia and Russian CyberCommand directed their actions against
Russian websites.13 Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian websites were also defaced, including the site of Russia Today, sometimes with historical references to World War II.14
Information leaks continued. A sensitive conversation between the Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Paet and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs
and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was made public, revealing their discussion
of information suggesting that both sides, the opposition and the government, were
responsible for sniper killings during the Maidan protests.15 Anti-Russian motivated
information leaks included the disclosure of the names of members of Berkut, the
anti-riot police,16 as well as documents belonging to a Russian defence contractor.17
During this time, it also became clear that the spyware Snake (also known as
Ouruborus or Turla) was used against several targets in Ukraine, including the government. Snake is sophisticated malware, known to be in use for at least eight years,
whose origin is uncertain, but believed to be developed in Russia.18

3.2.1 Legal Analysis
Although the UN and EU expressed their grave concerns about Russia’s annexation
of Crimea, and NATO called it a violation of international law,19 Russia defended its
actions as the lawful protection of the Russian speaking minority in Crimea. States
have the right to act when necessary to rescue their nationals abroad. However, in
this case, there were no indications that native Russians were in danger. Even if that
were the case, it could only have justified their evacuation, not the occupation of the
entire peninsula.20 A second possible justification for Russian intervention was an
invitation by the Ukrainian authorities, i.e. President Yanukovych. But, after Yanukovych was replaced by the Interim Government, his actions could not be attributed
to Ukraine anymore.21 A third possible justification is the right to self-determination for the people of Crimea. However, while this right exists for ‘peoples’ within
the existing borders of a state, it does not allow for a complete political separation.22
Russia’s annexation of Crimea was a breach of international law by violating
the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Russia also
breached the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and
Russia’s annexation of
the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation,
Crimea was a breach of
and Partnership.23 The Black Sea Fleet Status of
international law.
Forces Agreement allowed for a Russian military presence in Crimea, but not at the scale as
was the case in March 2014. But was this armed intervention also a use of force, a
violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter?24 Moving armed forces to the territory of
another state, without the consent of that state, should definitely be considered a use
of force.25 That is exactly what happened: troops belonging to the Russian Black Sea
Fleet in Crimea left their bases, and there were clear indications that other Russian

ʻ[A] spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon delivered a statement saying that he was ‘gravely concerned about
the deterioration of the situation’ in Ukraine and planned to speak shortly with Putin. It also called for ‘full respect for and
preservation of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine’ and demanded ‘immediate restoration of
calm and direct dialogue between all concerned’. Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton stated that the EU “deplores” what it called Russia’s decision to use military action in Ukraine, describing it as an
“unwarranted escalation of tensions”. She called on “all sides to decrease the tensions immediately through dialogue, in full
respect of Ukrainian and international law”. She added that: ‘The unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must
be respected at all times and by all sides. Any violation of these principles is unacceptable’. North Atlantic Council condemned
what it called Russia’s military escalation in Crimea and called it a breach of international law’. International reactions to the

troops were sent to Crimea to secure strategic sites, block Ukrainian troops, and
essentially force them to leave the peninsula.
States can take measures in response to violations of international law. In this
case the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia.
Could Russia’s actions be seen as an armed attack, in which case Ukraine would
have had the right to use force in self-defence?26 Like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’
is not defined in the UN Charter; in essence, a state determines on a case-by-case
basis whether it considers an attack against it as an ‘armed attack’. A violent attack
with military forces resulting in damage and casualties would certainly be seen as an
armed attack. In the case of Crimea, however, hardly a shot was fired. On the other
hand, it is difficult to argue that Ukraine would not have the right to use force to
drive Russian troops out of Crimea.27
Irrespective this analysis of the legal basis of the intervention in Crimea, what
would be the legal regime for the operations conducted by the parties to the conflict, including the cyber operations? Did the situation qualify as an ‘international
armed conflict’ where the Law of Armed Conflict applies? The criterion here is that
it relates to hostilities between nation-states. In Crimea, however, the situation was
unclear. Firstly, there was no fighting, although the threshold for ‘armed’ is low.28
Secondly, Russia denied the troops present were theirs and referred to them as
‘local self-defence groups’. However, reports indicated the active involvement of
Russian troops29 and, eventually, Putin admitted that Russian troops were present.30
Even in the event that only local forces were active, a situation of international
armed conflict could still prevail if they were acting under Russia’s control.

in Crimea, where Russia exercises territorial control without the consent of the

3.3 Hostilities in Eastern Ukraine (April 2014 – Present)
Following the annexation of Crimea, the world’s attention was quickly drawn to the
onset of hostilities in eastern Ukraine. Protesters from the Russian speaking minority in
the cities of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv occupied government buildings and called
for independence.33 Pro-Russian ‘separatist groups’ emerged. The Ukrainian authorities
responded by starting an ‘anti-terrorist operation’. On 17 April, the first violent deaths
occurred in eastern Ukraine; in the Black Sea city of Odessa, 42 people died in clashes.
On 11 May, Donetsk and Luhansk declared themselves to be independent republics.
Petro Poroshenko was elected President of Ukraine on 25 May, but this poll
could not be held in large parts of the conflict-ridden east. A cease-fire agreement,34
signed in Minsk on 5 September 2014, collapsed when fighting started again in
January 2015. A second agreement signed in the capital of Belarus on 11 February,
Minsk II, provided for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front
line, a release of prisoners of war, and constitutional reform in Ukraine.35 This second agreement has also been violated, although currently, in September 2015, the
situation seems to have calmed down. NATO reported the active involvement of
Russian troops in eastern Ukraine,36 but Russia has consistently denied involvement.
Cyber operations have continued throughout the conflict. In May 2014, cyber
means were used in an attempt to disrupt the presidential elections, including an
effort to falsify the outcome. CyberBerkut may have taken part and some analysts
believe that Russia was behind it.37 In August 2014, hackers conducted a DDoS attack
against Ukraine’s election commission website, just prior to the parliamentary polls.38
There are numerous publicly-known examples of intelligence gathering through
cyber means, all of which reportedly have a Russian connection. In the Summer
of 2014, the Blackenergy spyware was used against Ukrainian government institutions.39 In August, the Snake malware was employed against the Ukrainian Prime
Minister’s Office, as well as a number of foreign embassies.40 In April 2015, Lookinglass reported on a Russian campaign to extract classified documents from Ukrainian
military and law enforcement agencies in an effort to support pro-Russian military

operations in Ukraine.41 ISight Partners reported that Russian Sandworm hackers
used a ‘zero-day’ vulnerability to hack NATO and Ukraine in a cyber espionage
campaign.42 The list of targets was not confined to Ukrainian sites. In January 2015,
CyberBerkut claimed responsibility for a cyber attack on German Government sites,
demanding that Germany end its support to the Ukrainian government.43
On the pro-Ukraine side, the Ukrainian Cyber Troops reportedly claimed to have
hacked into Russian interior ministry servers and CCTV cameras in separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine.44
3.3.1 Legal Analysis
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has characterised the situation in eastern Ukraine as a ‘non-international armed conflict’,45 a situation in which
hostilities occur between governmental armed forces and non-governmental organised armed groups, or between such organised armed groups. The two requirements
are a certain degree of organisation of the non-governmental groups and the existence of ‘protracted armed violence’.46 The conflict in Eastern Ukraine does in fact
reach a high level of violence over a longer period of time, and the separatists do in
fact have a high degree of organisation.
Although Russia has consistently denied involvement, there continues to be
widespread belief to the contrary, suggesting that Moscow actively supports the
Donetsk and Luhansk separatists, including by sending Russian military forces as
‘volunteers’ to the area. If Russia actively participates or exercises ‘overall control’
over the separatists, the conflict could be considered an international armed conflict. To meet the criterion of ‘overall control’, a state must not only finance, train,
equip, or provide operational support to local forces, but also have a role in organising, coordinating, and planning their operations.47
However, for the purpose of this chapter, the conflict in eastern Ukraine is considered to be a non-international armed conflict.
This analysis results in a situation where different legal regimes apply simultane41

ously. The Law of Armed Conflict pursuant to international armed conflicts applies
to the occupation of Crimea. Eastern Ukraine is a national issue in which the law
pursuant to non-international armed conflicts applies. There is a crucial difference.
During an international armed conflict, the Law of Armed Conflict applies to the
full extent; during a non-international armed conflict, minimum rules apply.48 An
example is that in an international armed conflict, combatants captured by the
enemy are entitled to Prisoner of War (PoW) status. In a non-international armed
conflict, the combatant’s status is unknown; belligerents have to be treated well, but
the extensive rules that protect PoWs do not apply. However, many rules of international armed conflict are customary law and apply also in a non-international
armed conflict, as we will see with respect to cyber operations.

Legal Implications for Cyber Operations in Ukraine

The conflict started as an internal matter, the protests at Maidan Square, to an
unlawful intervention and occupation of Crimea, culminating in the non-international armed conflict in eastern Ukraine.
During the first phase, the Euromaidan protests, the cyber incidents were a law
enforcement issue. For example, the defacement of websites and DDoS attacks
restricting the use of internet services violated Ukrainian criminal law and could
have been prosecuted in Ukrainian courts.49 Malicious cross-border cyber activities, involving both Ukraine and other countries, would fall under the criminal
jurisdiction of Ukraine and the affected countries.
During the occupation of Crimea and the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, the
Law of Armed Conflict applies. It regulates the conduct of all actors in the conDuring the Euromaidan

will be discussed; after that the cyber
operations we have seen in the Ukraine
conflict will be evaluated from the perspective of the Law of Armed Conflict.
4.1 Actors in Cyberspace
In an international armed conflict, belligerents that qualify as ‘combatants’ enjoy combatant immunity, meaning they cannot be prosecuted for taking part in hostilities (except
48

49

These ‘minimum rules’ are formulated in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, and in Additional Protocol II to the
Geneva Conventions. The rules laid down in that protocol apply to a conflict within a state that is party to the Protocol between
the armed forces of that state and dissident armed forces or organised armed groups that control sufficient territory so ‘as to
enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations’, Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12
August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977, Article
1(1). Ukraine is party to Additional Protocol II, and the separatists do control significant territory.
Ukraine is Party to the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 2001). The Convention aims to harmonise cybercrime legislation and facilitate information exchange and international cooperation in the area of prosecution of cybercrimes. States that
are party to the convention are obliged to incorporate certain violations in their national laws: ‘illegal access’, ‘illegal interception’, ‘data interference’, ‘system interference’, and ‘misuse of devices’.

for war crimes) and, on capture, have PoW status. These rules also apply during occupation, as in Crimea. Most cyber actors in Crimea were nominally non-state actors, for
example the pro-Russian hacker group CyberBerkut. If such a group were an integrated
part of Russia’s military forces, they would be combatants. If not, they could nevertheless
be considered combatants if they were part of an organised armed group, belonging to a
party to the conflict, when they fulfil the following conditions: (a) being commanded by
a person responsible for his subordinates; (b) having a fixed distinctive sign recognisable
at a distance; (c) carrying arms openly; and (d) conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.50 These criteria are important to distinguish
combatants from civilians. It is unlikely that non-state hacker groups, also those active
in the Ukraine crisis, meet all these criteria, especially when they are only ‘virtually’
organised, only in contact through the internet.
Hackers or hacker groups who are non-combatants are to be regarded civilians.
However, if they are ‘directly participating in hostilities’, they lose their protection as
civilians and can be targeted by the opposing party. Three criteria have to be met to be
regarded ‘civilians directly participating in hostilities.’ 51 First, there has to be a certain
amount of ‘harm’; the ‘act must be likely to adversely affect the military operations or
military capacity of [the adversary] or […] to inflict death, injury or destruction on
persons or objects protected against direct attack’.52 Second, there has to be a ‘causal
connexion’ between the acts and the harm inflicted. Third, there has to be a ‘belligerent nexus’, meaning that the operations must be intended to affect the adversary’s
military operations. Harm can also be inflicted by cyber operations, and does not necessarily have to include physical damage. In the case of CyberBerkut and other active
hacker groups the effects probably did not reach the threshold of ‘harm’.
In non-international armed conflicts, like in eastern Ukraine, ‘combatant immunity’
does not exist. Whether or not belligerents – especially non-state armed groups – have
immunity, will be determined based on domestic law. Certain cyber operations will be
illegal based on domestic law. Civilians have protected status, but as in international armed
conflicts, when they are ‘directly participating in hostilities’ they lose that protected status.
4.2 Information Operations
During the conflict in Ukraine, cyber was mainly used for information warfare and
intelligence gathering – not to damage cyber or critical infrastructure. Irrespective
their effects, cyber operations are very often called ‘cyber attack.’ It is important to note
that, in the context of international and non-international armed conflicts, ‘attack’ has
a very specific meaning. ‘Attacks means acts of violence against the adversary, whether
in offence or in defence.’53 Whether or not an operation qualifies as attack is crucial

because the law imposes prohibitions and restrictions with respect to attacks, for
example the prohibition to attack civilians, civilian objects, and medical installations,
and the requirement to take precautions before conducting an attack. Not every cyber
operation that affects the adversary is an attack. A cyber operation that constitutes an
act of violence however, is an attack. The Tallinn Manual defines a ‘cyber attack’ as ‘a
cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause
injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.’54 This interpretation of
the current law restricts ‘cyber attacks’ to acts that have physical consequences.
If the parties to the conflict in Ukraine would have used cyber to inflict physical
damage, injuries, or death, or to support kinetic operations, those cyber operations
would be ‘(cyber) attacks’ and subject to the relevant prohibitions and restrictions.
Most of the cyber activities in Ukraine however are information operations and do
not meet the ‘attack’ threshold. Information operations, as such, are not directly
addressed in the Law of Armed Conflict.

among the civilian population.55 The disruption
of elections, that took place in Ukraine, definitely violated domestic law, and when
conducted or supported by another state, could also have been a breach of international law, but was not a violation of the Law of Armed Conflict.
4.3 Cyber Espionage
During the conflict in Ukraine, cyber means have been used to gather intelligence
including Snake, Blackenergy, and Sandworm. Intelligence gathering and espionage
are not forbidden by international law. Espionage, in the context of the Law of Armed
Conflict, has a narrow scope: it refers to operations that are conducted clandestinely
or under false pretences, taking place on territory controlled by the adversary; ‘behind
enemy lines’.56 For instance, a close access cyber operation where an agent is gaining
access to servers being used by the adversary by feigning a false identity and extracting
information by using a thumb drive, could be espionage. An agent captured before
reaching his own troops has no PoW status and can be tried as a spy. Gathering intelligence from a distance is not espionage in the meaning of the Law of Armed Conflict.
Snake, Blackenergy, and Sandworm reportedly have a Russian connection. If
Russia – or another state – would be actively supporting the separatists in eastern
Ukraine by providing intelligence, that would not necessarily ‘internationalise’ the
conflict. Mere operational support does not meet the ‘overall control’ threshold.57

Conclusions

International law applies to cyberspace. During armed conflict, the Law of Armed
Conflict applies to any cyber operation conducted in association with the hostilities.
Until now, we have not seen a case where cyber hostilities between parties by themselves constituted an armed conflict. Rather, they have remained as one part of a larger,
traditional conflict. This dynamic has not changed during the conflict in Ukraine.
This chapter describes the international legal framework for the conflict in
Ukraine and the cyber operations that have been conducted in association with that
conflict. The ‘legal situation’ is somewhat unclear due to diverging views on various
aspects of the crisis, such as the annexation of Crimea and the alleged involvement
of Russian military forces in eastern Ukraine. Another aspect that complicates a
legal evaluation is that cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors,
whose status and affiliation are not always clear.
The protests at Maidan Square turned violent, but they were not an ‘armed conflict’; they were an internal law enforcement matter. The annexation of Crimea led
to the peninsula’s occupation by Russia, but Russia disputes that interpretation.
During an occupation, the Law of Armed Conflict applies. Eastern Ukraine can
today be considered a non-international armed conflict, where cyber operations
must be conducted in accordance with the minimum safeguards the Law of Armed
Conflict provides for such situations.
In the Ukraine conflict, the publicly

Ukraine. The prevailing assumption is
that, with the exception of some advanced
cyber espionage malware such as Snake, the known cyber attacks could have been conducted by non-state actors. These hackers or hacker groups, trying to affect the adversary’s military activities, are participating in hostilities and have to conduct their operations in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict.
At the end of the day, cyber operations in the Ukraine conflict have been used
either to gather intelligence or as part of an ongoing ‘information war’ between the
parties. They were not launched to inflict damage to infrastructure and other military
capabilities. As a result, most of these cyber operations have not yet risen to the level
of activities proscribed or even governed by the Law of Armed Conflict. That would
be different when cyber would be more integrated in kinetic warfare operations.

as a Test for Proposed
Cyber Norms

Introduction

In international forums, governments, academia, and the private sector have strenuously argued that states must agree on existing or develop a set of international
norms for conflict in cyberspace. Our current environment is characterised by a
steep rise in the development of offensive cyber tools and tactics – as well as a general disagreement on when and where it is appropriate to use them. The overall
result is a popular perception of a weakened international security environment that
threatens to devolve into an anarchic Hobbesian world of ‘all against all’. Against this
backdrop, there have been urgent calls for greater investment in cyber diplomacy.1
The term ‘norm’ has become someThe term ‘norm’ has become

to certain rules of behaviour with regard
to conducting cyber operations. This chapter will thus first describe the nature of
‘cyber norms’ and then discuss the primary developments in the global arena. The
author’s focus will be on the proposed cyber norms of behaviour that would have
a politically binding character, and will avoid discussing existing international law

(legal norms)2 as well as the challenges of practical implementation of the these
norms.
Finally, this chapter will analyse the Ukraine crisis in light of these proposals, and attempt to assess their rationality and applicability. The Russo-Ukrainian
conflict, in theory, offers a suitable case study in that there has been ample room
for malicious state-sponsored cyber activities: first, nation-states perceived as
having considerable cyber capabilities – not only Russia and Ukraine, but also
surrounding nations and the member states of NATO – are involved, at least indirectly; and second, the crisis has both endured and evolved from the Euromaidan
street protests to the Russian annexation of Crimea to open, armed conflict in
eastern Ukraine.

Proposed ‘Political’ Cyber Norms

In international relations, norms are often defined as ‘collective expectations of
proper behaviour for an actor with a given identity’,3 which is broad enough that
states (and other stakeholders) use the term to put forward a wide range of proposals in diplomatic forums. This chapter takes a simplified approach, limiting its scope
to (1) legal and (2) political norms: the
‘proper behaviour’ of states is comprehenNorms reflect the internasively regulated by international law (i.e.
tional community’s expeclegal norms such as treaties, international
tations, set standards for
customs, and general principles of interresponsible State behaviour. national law)4 and through cyber diplomacy in the form of political or non-legally
binding agreements. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN
GGE) has explained the nature of these politically binding instruments by stating
that ‘norms reflect the international community’s expectations, set standards for
responsible State behaviour and allow the international community to assess the
activities and intentions of States’. The problem, of course, is that breaches of such
political norms only give rise to political, non-legal consequences.5
There has been some agreement between nation states on setting international
‘cyber norms’. In 2013, the UN published an accord, written by a GGE including
representatives from the US, UK, China, and Russia, expressing consensus on the

basic notion that existing international law applies to cyberspace. 6 In 2015, the same
forum published another report7 which delved into greater detail, but the GGE has
previously not elaborated on precisely how to apply existing laws (legal norms) to
the nuanced field of cyber security. The reports did state, however, that the unique
attributes of information and communications technology (ICTs) could demand
the creation of altogether new norms.
The fairly general agreement expressed in the reports can be viewed both as
the lowest common denominator between the world’s key cyber powers and as a
manifestation of a general lack of clarity in this new geopolitical arena. Meanwhile
academia has to some degree filled the void, actively addressing the applicability of existing international law,8 although work in the area of state practice and
interpretation has been relatively limited. In the context of norms restraining state
behaviour, existing international law such as the prohibition on the use of force and
the law of armed conflict (LOAC) are highly relevant and indispensable, but it is
likely that additional norms – political rather than legal – will be developed by the
international community over time. Two somewhat opposing approaches to these
new political norms will be addressed below.
One group of nations acting as ‘norm entrepreneurs’9 seems to aim for a treaty-level agreement to govern state activities in cyberspace. Member nations of the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)10 have proposed a Code of Conduct for
International Information Security11 to the UN. In parallel, Russia has developed (in
2011) a separate concept for a Convention on International Information Security12
which covers, to a large extent, the same territory.
These proposed instruments do not apply the prefix ‘cyber’ when addressing
ICT-related issues; instead, the focus is on preserving ‘information security’ which
represents a broad conceptualisation of the threat environment and the scope of
limited state activities.13 According to SCO’s own agreement on information security (the Yekaterinburg Agreement of 2009)14 and the aforementioned Convention
proposal by Russia (2011), ‘information war’ entails, in addition to damaging information systems and critical infrastructures (which is often the ‘Western’ scope of

actions when the term ‘cyber security’ is used), also ‘psychologic brainwashing to
destabilise society and state’, signalling that for them the threat also stems from content and information itself.15
The Code of Conduct puts a strong emphasis on the principle of information
sovereignty,16 arguing that states should not use ‘ICTs and information and communication networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other states or with the
aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability’. It asks states
to refrain from ‘activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security’ and highlights a state’s responsibility to protect ‘information space and critical information infrastructure against damage resulting

voluntary norms of behaviour that pertain during peacetime.18 According to this

lowing four norms of which the first three were included in the recent UN GGE
report:20
(1) states should not conduct or knowingly support online activity that
damages or impairs critical infrastructure (norm 1);
(2) states should not conduct or knowingly support activity intended to
prevent the national Computer Security Incidents Response Teams
(CSIRTs or CERTs) from responding to cyber incidents, nor use
CSIRTs to do harm (norm 2);
(3) states should cooperate with other states in investigating cybercrime
by collecting electronic evidence and mitigating cyber activity emanating from its territory (norm 3); and
(4) states should not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of
commercially valuable intellectual property (norm 4).
Before we move on, it is important to note that these and other cyber norms
have been analysed in academic circles21 as well as in the private sector. For example,
Microsoft has recommended six cybersecurity norms designed to limit the proliferation of cyber weapons and offensive operations in cyberspace.22

Observations from Ukraine:
Hints of State-sponsored Operations

The attribution of cyber attacks is notoriously difficult. In order to discover
state-sponsored operations, one can only speculate based upon inconclusive indicators such as target, malware, motive, and complexity.
In Ukraine, some advanced cyber espionage tools such as Turla/Snake/Ourobours and Sandworm have not only been linked to the conflict, but also associated
with an ‘Advanced Persistent Threat’ (APT) actor (i.e. nation-state), likely Russia.23
At the same time, analysts have argued that most of the cyber attack methods in
Ukraine such as DDoS attacks and defacements have been technically unsophisticated. Thus, on balance, the ‘complexity criterion’ appears unmet.

Actions attributed to hacktivist groups raise questions
regarding possible coordination with state entities.

Actions attributed to hacktivist
groups also raise questions regarding
possible coordination with state entities. For example, Ukrainian officials
reported that, even when the hacktivist
group CyberBerkut failed to compromise Ukraine’s online election system and only managed to present fake election
results on the election’s website for a very brief period, a Russian state-owned TV
channel still displayed these results immediately.24 In another incident, CyberBerkut
allegedly leaked the recording of a phone call between Estonian Minster of Foreign Affairs Urmas Paet and European Union (EU) High Representative for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton, suggesting that Cyber Berkut either
possesses sophisticated cyber capabilities or has links to Russian intelligence services.25
Here, we must remember SCO’s focus on ‘information security’, as opposed to
‘cyber security’, and in fact many analysts believe that both Russia26 and Ukraine27
are conducting information operations within the context of the ongoing conflict in
eastern Ukraine. The internet is a natural terrain for these operations;28 the reported
‘troll factories’ in St. Petersburg creating pro-Russian comments for online new
media serve as prominent examples.29

Which Norms of Behaviour Were Followed?

Thus, there are two dominant ongoing conversations relative to the creation of
political cyber norms: (1) the information security norms proposed by the SCO,
and (2) the voluntary norms of behaviour in peacetime (initially promoted by the
US). This section will analyse the known cyber incidents in Ukraine in the context
of these two normative frameworks.

4.1 The Information Security Norms Proposed by the SCO
In general, the state-sponsored conventional military operations in Ukraine are not
in accordance with international norms;30 therefore, it should come as no surprise
that the reported cyber incidents also appear unorthodox. However, one important
question, given that Russia is directly involved in the Ukraine conflict, is how these
cyber incidents fit into the Code of Conduct
framework whose primary focus is informaAlleged Russian cyber
tion sovereignty. In that regard, alleged Rusoperations appear inconsian cyber operations would appear inconsissistent with the norms it
tent with the norms it has hitherto proposed
or supported. In fact, most of the cyber incihas hitherto proposed.
dents reported by both sides in the conflict
seem to fall into the category of information operations, which could be interpreted
as violating another state’s information sovereignty. In the words of the Code of
Conduct, ICTs were likely used in an effort to interfere ‘in the internal affairs of
other States […] with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social
stability’.
Since the norms supported by SCO and Russia focus on ‘information’ rather
than strictly ‘cyber’ security, one can see that the non-cyber information operations via other media such as TV are also inconsistent with the stated principle of
information sovereignty. The Code of Conduct also prohibits the abuse of a ‘dominant position’ in cyberspace; in this regard too, Russia may have violated its own
principles by abusing its control over Russian-owned social media networks such
as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki which are also popular among Ukrainian users.31
Analysing the application of the SCO-proposed information security norms
reveals an inherent weakness: quantifying the influence of highly subjective information content or identifying a breach of ‘information sovereignty’ is problematic,
if not impossible.
4.2 The Voluntary Norms of Behaviour in Peacetime
The voluntary, politically binding norms advocated by the US (and partly recommended by the UN GGE) are intended to apply in peacetime. Nonetheless – and
however one classifies the Ukraine conflict from a legal perspective32 – we can still
speculate relative to their application during a time of conflict.
In Ukraine, the most important observation so far is that no destructive cyber
attacks on critical infrastructure (CI) have been reported by either side. To some
degree, this offers hope that the norm of limiting cyber attacks against CI could

evolve into a standard of behaviour.33 A
possible exception is the alleged sabotage of the Ukrainian election system,
but even here, one might disagree over
whether this was a simple information
operation or a serious attack against
CI.34 The pertinent question here may relate to the proper definition of CI.
Historically, there have been some significant network intrusions,35 but relatively
few examples of effective cyber attacks against CI.36 The few cases that are presented as destructive state-sponsored attacks – Stuxnet being the best-documented
example37 – can still be seen as outliers. With that in mind, even well-established
norms are mere ‘collective expectations of proper behaviour’38, and it is unrealistic
to assume that every actor (especially a nation at war) would always abide by them.
Assuming there have been no attacks against CI in Ukraine, can we say that this
is another example of cyber powers restraining themselves?39 First, this restraint
may be strongly influenced by case-specific
factors, as explained by Martin Libicki in

(or otherwise harm the citizens of an adversary state) for strategic gain?40 Or does
the case of Ukraine show that cyber operations are now universally employed, but
less effective than feared?41 In other words, the tactical opportunities that cyber is
often seen as providing – the infinite reach, low cost of entry, and plausible deniability – may not easily translate to the strategic level.42 This is also apparent as there

is still no shortage of ‘cyber sceptics’,43 even if the vexing attribution problem were
hypothetically to go away.44
The Ukraine case study, at least, suggests that cyber has not yet ‘changed the game’
in terms of state vs. state cyber attacks that destroy physical infrastructure. More likely,
it can be understood as one additional weapon in a state’s arsenal, and that existing
norms – both legal and political – governing traditional state-to-state actions are still
followed as if they were applying to other, more conventional attack methods.
As of October 2015, the examples of cyber incidents in the Ukraine crisis allow
us to make tentative observations about the other proposed norms of behaviours
(2, 3, and 4). In respect of norm number 2, there have been no reported allegations
of interference with the work of the national CERTs. However, although some personal communications may have continued, there have been few official CERT to
CERT discussions since the conflict began.45 Against number 3, there have been no
published reports of recent Russo-Ukrainian cybercrime investigations,46 but that
may be too much to hope for given that the two countries are currently in open
conflict. However, the fact that Russia is unwilling to accede to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime does not stand in its favour.
The final norm, number 4, which asks states not to steal intellectual property
via cyber means, is also likely not followed, given the two countries’ current state of
hostilities and numerous reports of ongoing cyber espionage. Adopting the norm
concerning cyber espionage is in any case fraught with challenges, as its primary
norm entrepreneur, the US, has been heavily criticised by both allies and adversaries in the wake of the Snowden revelations. Further, it can be difficult – if not highly
subjective – to determine whether any given attack was intended for political or
economic gain. On a global level, cyber espionage appears to be a silently accepted
norm. The latest UN GGE (2015), for example, did not mention it in its latest publication, signalling that the international community is currently not motivated to
address the topic, and its global curtailment, at least in the short term, is unlikely.

Conclusion

The Ukraine case study suggests that, during this conflict, nation-states have not
adhered to many of the proposed ‘political’ cyber norms covered in this chapter.
Hence, it is doubtful that these rules will be globally accepted in the near future.

143

First, the known cyber operations appear contrary to the letter and spirit of the
Code of Conduct as most of the incidents can be seen as part of the larger information war. Second, most of the norms advocated by the US were also breached as
cyber espionage was widely reported, and international cooperation between the
two nation’s CERTs and law enforcement agencies has been absent.
As a positive sign for international security, there have been no reports of destructive cyber attacks against CI in Ukraine. This appears to go against what one could
expect to see in a modern military conflict. Is this a sign that the norm of not using
cyber to harm CI – as also recently advocated by the UN GGE – is likely to be globally accepted and followed in the future? Hopefully, as this potential norm is perhaps
the most important in terms of strengthening international cyber security and stability. As of October 2015, the Ukraine conflict appears to indicate that cyber operations have not yet (contrary

Introduction

The Ukraine war is a game changer in the international security environment, and its
ramifications in Northern Europe are profound. Numerous countries in the region
feel that their national security is directly threatened, especially those bordering Russia. New NATO members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland are seeking concrete
forms of reassurance from Washington and Brussels, while non-members like Sweden and Finland have reinforced their ties with the NATO Alliance. The Nordic and
Baltic countries have sought a closer partnership during the Ukraine war, and this has
created an opportunity to advance their regional cyber security dialogue.
Received wisdom states that small countries, especially those located next to a
big country, are most at risk when international security breaks down, and that big
states do what they want while small states do what they must. During the war in
Ukraine, northern European countries have been forced to re-evaluate their relationship with NATO as well as their preparedness against Russia’s ‘hybrid warfare’
which blends conventional and unconventional operations, regular and irregular
tactics, information warfare, and cyber warfare. Cyber threats in particular have
been an integral part of these ongoing discussions, as northern European countries
have been subjected to various forms of cyber attack during the Ukraine war.
This chapter concentrates on two of Russia’s neighbours that have always been
in the ‘realist’ camp in term of their national security policy: Finland and Esto-

145

nia. The response of each nation to the Ukraine crisis has been different, reflecting
their traditional approaches to foreign and security policy as well as their existing
ties to NATO. Yet these two nations have much in common: a fundamental interest in regional stability, Western unity, a norms-based view of international order,
interdependence, and an essential need for cooperation in the field of foreign and
security policy. These same principles drive both nations’ prevailing views on both
information security and cyber security – two issues which are sometimes distinct,
and sometimes closely related.

Finland: Coming to Terms with Hybrid Warfare

‘Is Finland really getting ready for war with Russia?’ An American news channel
posed this question in May 2015, when nearly a million Finnish military reservists
received letters detailing their assigned duties in a crisis situation.1 In fact, the correspondence was unrelated to Russia’s annexation of Crimea or its ongoing war in
Ukraine, but the media attention that this event generated speaks volumes about the
age-old nature of the Russo-Finnish relationship.
Historically, Finland´s national security strategy has almost exclusively been
focused on Russia, and Finns have been following the war in Ukraine extremely
closely. From the beginning, Finland has condemned Russia´s activities in its largest
European neighbour. Finnish President Sauli Niinistö summarised the current situation well: ‘We have a long history with Russia — not that peaceful all the time. So
everything the Russians are doing, surely the Finns notice and think very carefully
about what that might mean’.2 Defence Minister Carl Haglund was more direct in
his choice of words: ‘Russia says one thing but does another. I do not trust Russia
at all’.3
The concept of ‘cyber’ is rather new in the Finnish language.4 It was institutionalised in 2013, when Finland published its National Cyber Security Strategy, which
described cyber security as ‘the desired end state in which the cyber domain is reliable and in which its functioning is ensured’.5 Public discussion of the importance
of cyber security is a natural outgrowth of Finland being one of the most advanced
information societies in the world, a country that relies heavily on the proper functioning of myriad electronic networks and services. For years, there has been an
active societal debate in Finland on topics such as public-private partnerships in
cyberspace, the need for better legislation, the development of cyber defence capabilities within the Finnish Defence Forces, and much more.

In Finland, there has been intense analytical focus on Russia´s traditional
warfare capabilities (including in Ukraine), but there has been limited discussion
regarding Russia’s cyber activities. Finnish analysts have noticed Russian cyber espionage in Ukraine, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against Ukraine,

cyber attacks have not played a greater role
in the conflict, and frankly, we expected to see more. According to our analysis, the
primary reason for this is likely that Ukraine is simply not a very cyber-dependent
country; therefore, Russia could better fulfil its national security agenda by other
means, as cyber attacks may not have the desired effect. As a consequence, it has not
been necessary for Russia to use its more strategic cyber capabilities.
In Finland, one change has been a deeper appreciation of the seriousness of
cyber espionage, and this is partly due to Russia´s cyber activity in Ukraine. For the
first time, Finland has accused Russia of carrying out intelligence activities – both
physical and cyber – within its territory. In the past, Finnish Security Police reports
had only vaguely mentioned that some ‘foreign countries’ had engaged in espionage
against Finland.
Cyber threats from Russia have been viewed in Finland primarily in the context of ‘hybrid’ warfare, which is understood in Finland to be a more intelligent
or efficient way to wage war because it seeks to achieve political goals without the
extensive use of traditional violence. Using a range of tools such as cyber attacks,
economic pressure, information operations, and limited physical attacks to generate uncertainty in the mind of the general population, an aggressor may be able to
achieve its desired political goals.
In Finland, it is understood that modern Russian warfare puts great emphasis
on cyber and electronic warfare. In particular, Russian activities in Ukraine have
spurred Finland to strengthen its military and societal defences. The new Finnish Government programme puts it this way: ‘The Government will strengthen
the comprehensive concept of security nationally, in the EU and in international
cooperation. This applies, in particular, to new and large-scale threats, such as the
defence against hybrid attacks, cyber attacks and terrorism’.7
From a Nordic perspective, one of the most alarming aspects of the Ukraine
crisis has been Russian attempts to wage information warfare to influence public
opinion. Finnish media – and even ordinary Finns – have discussed this dynamic in
detail. Even the Finnish Prime Minister has openly stated that there is an ongoing

tified – or simply denied. The Russian
Embassy in Helsinki has active Facebook and Twitter accounts; on Twitter, @russianembfinla has retweeted pro-Russia trolls and the (often anonymous) tweets of
anti-Western voices, blocked Finnish journalists critical of Russia, distributed photos of Ukrainian civilian casualties, and altered the messages of Finnish tweeters.
There are numerous vexing challenges. For example, it is difficult to prepare
countermeasures for an attack that is outsourced to hacker groups that lie outside
normal state structures. In Ukraine, these are theoretically separatist groups in
Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Cyberspace is the ideal place to wage anonymous – or
at least plausibly deniable – operations.
For Finnish defence planning, the increased use of hybrid warfare does not mean
forgetting more traditional military threats to our nation, but it does complicate
matters – especially societal preparedness. Cyber attacks are now an integral part
of all conflicts and wars, and they are blurring the line between peace and war. As
Finland´s President Niinistö stated:
‘With hybrid warfare, we are facing a substantial change in military
operations. The boundary between actual war and other exercise of
power is becoming blurred. Means of cyber war and information war are
becoming increasingly important. It is now possible to fight a war without actually being at war. At the same time, conflict escalation is setting
new speed records, as we saw for instance in the Crimea.’ 9

capable of cyber-attacks are increasing’.11
Estonia has been subjected to pressure from Moscow for years, but Russian
cyber espionage in Estonia’s government and commercial affairs is also getting
worse. Therefore, when tensions began to rise in Ukraine, Estonia was one of the
first nations to sound the alarm. In late 2014, Estonia´s Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas declared that ‘[w]e, in Estonia, fully understand that challenges may arise from
other directions, including in the cyber domain’.12
Russian´s annexation of Crimea has raised fears in the Baltic states that they
could be the next victims of Russian aggression. In all three countries, there are
many people alive today who personally witnessed Russian tactics similar to those
now on display in Ukraine. Both Latvia and Estonia have large Russian-speaking
minorities living within their borders.
Estonia is different from Finland in one key regard – its NATO membership.
Estonia´s President Toomas Hendrik Ilves is an active figure in NATO security
and policy circles, particularly those that relate to cyber: ‘Shutting down a country
with a cyberattack would be very difficult but not impossible. If you did that, why
wouldn’t that be a case for Article 5 action?’ Article 5 of the NATO Charter states
that any attack on one member of the Alliance can be viewed as an attack on all. At
the NATO Wales Summit in 2014, in part due to Ilves´s tireless work, NATO ministers ratified a policy stating that not only conventional and nuclear attacks, but also
cyber attacks, may lead to an invocation of Article 5.13,14
In the past, a NATO ally under cyber attack could convene a group to consult on
the attack, but not call on allies to respond in any way. With cyber attacks now falling
under Article 5, NATO members now have the option of doing so. This is a major
shift in policy, given that cyber warfare is still largely shrouded in mystery and secrecy.
National cyber capabilities tend to be highly classified. Therefore, despite differing
capabilities, viewpoints, and thresholds (after all, what Estonia might consider to be
an intolerable assault on its sovereignty might not be seen the same way in Brussels or
Washington) this was a significant event in that a public announcement that NATO
might respond to a cyber attack as it would to a kinetic or traditional attack has tangible value in the realm of international military deterrence.
During the conflict in Ukraine, DDoS attacks against Estonia have been surprisingly few. In fact, despite expectations, the past year has been unusually calm

According to the global cyber security index of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Estonia is ranked fifth in
the world in the field, and according to the recently published Business Software Alliance (BSA) report, Estonia, Austria and
Netherlands are the most cyber-secure countries in Europe.

compared to the previous year.15 In 2013, the level was much higher: for example,
the websites of the Ministry of Defence and the Estonian Defence Forces were both
hit by DDoS, for which responsibility was claimed by ‘Anonymous Ukraine’.16 Also
in 2013, the website of Estonian railway company Elron (which happens to be the
most popular Google search term in Estonia) was defaced with messages claiming
that passenger train traffic had been halted as a result of a NATO military exercise.17
Earlier the same day, the website of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre
of Excellence (NATO CCD COE) came under DDoS attack (Anonymous Ukraine
again claimed responsibility). At NATO Headquarters in Belgium, several websites
have been targeted during the Ukraine war, as well as NATO’s unclassified e-mail
system. NATO officials have described these attacks as serious assaults, but also said
that they did not pose any risk to NATO´s classified networks.18
The hacker group ‘Cyber Berkut’ said the attacks were carried out by patriotic
Ukrainians angry over NATO interference in their country, and also stated that
NATO CCD COE experts had been in Ukraine training ‘cyber terrorists’. Although
attribution of cyber attacks to specific actors and nations is difficult, technical analysis of the Cyber Berkut’s domains as well as the nature of its propaganda strongly
suggest ties to Russia.19
Since the beginning of 2014, however, Estonian cyberspace has been unusually
calm. Like Finland, Estonia has seen espionage, pro-Russia trolling on Estonian
web forums, and propaganda, but little in the way of malware or computer exploits.
Estonians feel that the ‘hostile information flow’ from Russia is aimed at creating
and widening rifts between native Estonians and ethnic Russians (Moscow does
not see normal relations as beneficial to its current foreign policy). For example,
on 4 March 2015, the television channel Rossiya-1 (a key source of information for
many ethnic Russians in the Baltic region) aired a satirical anti-Nazi video that was
said to be ‘proof ’ of Estonia’s support for Nazism.20 In response, Estonia will create its own Russian-language TV channel, to be launched in September 2015 by a
state-financed public broadcaster, that will seek to empower the local ethnic Russian
identity.21
A NATO member only since 2004, Estonia today occupies a highly visible
position within the Alliance. Thus, the hybrid military campaign that Russia has
launched in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine almost forces NATO to take proactive
steps to guard against the use of such tactics in the Baltic states, if not to rethink
some of its defence strategies altogether. As Estonia´s Defence Minister Sven Mikser stated, ‘We have reason to believe that Russia views the Baltic region as one

of NATO’s most vulnerable areas, a place where NATO’s resolve and commitment
could be tested’.22
Today, cyber security is increasingly seen as playing a vital role in national security affairs, both in and out of NATO. For its part, Estonia is already sharing its cyber
security experience and expertise with Ukraine, including the organisation of large
cyber security drills. And finally, Estonia has one major advantage on its side: it is
home to the NATO CCD COE, whose symbolic importance to Estonia has grown
rapidly.

Conclusion: David vs. Goliath in Cyberspace

Finland and Estonia both rank among the world’s most connected and cyber security-savvy countries.23 In both nations, there is a high degree of dependence on the
internet, as well as a deep appreciation for the strategic nature of modern networks
and the need to secure them. Therefore, both Finland and Estonia are at the forefront of the nations creating cyber norms in the world.24
The need to prepare defences against modern hybrid warfare forces governments, including those of Finland and Estonia, to take steps sooner rather than
later. There will be conflicts in which the regular armed forces of a foreign state are
not the most active participants. Some of the attacks may occur entirely in cyberspace, and the attackers might even remain anonymous. In the internet era, a wide
range of national laws must be re-examined and contingencies rehearsed, so that
decision-makers have the best possible tools to respond to the challenges of hybrid
warfare in the future.
Russia is far larger and more populous than both Finland and Estonia, but traditional notions of size – especially in the globalised internet era – is not the only
determining factor on the cyber battlefield. Smaller countries such as Finland and
Estonia, with a strong heritage of technical capability and experience, may possess
some advantages that not even great powers could dream of. In the near term, Finland will continue to strengthen its

Introduction

We may be facing the internet’s most dangerous moment.
From the earliest days of cyber intelligence, a rule of thumb was that ‘those with
the capability to cause significant cyber disruption lack the intent; those with the
intent lack the capability’.1 Some
governments, including the United

had the capability, but have lacked the
motivation to bring down the internet. However, times change, and Vladimir Putin,
now facing strong sanctions and a weak rouble, could choose to retaliate against the
West in the form of ‘little green bytes’. US and European economies may, in fact, be
natural targets, carrying the implicit message: if you seriously affect Russia’s financial health, you too will feel the pain.

Conflict in cyberspace offers adversaries many possibilities and Putin has
numerous options. In the near term, there are four obvious scenarios: local instability, intimidation, frozen cyber conflict, and coercion.
The first option, local instability, would exclusively target Ukraine, causing cyber
disruption in the hope of keeping the country prostrate while trying to avoid escalation with the West and a tightening of sanctions. In the second option, intimidation,
Putin would use cyber capabilities against the West to mirror his existing recipe
of strategic threats, military exercises, submarine deployments, nuclear threats and
nuclear-capable bomber flights. A further escalation here could be a third option
– a frozen cyber conflict, where techniques of hybrid warfare are used to try for
medium-term disruption to the internet itself. The fourth option, coercion, would
go beyond local disruption and provocations and would attempt to use cyber force
to disrupt Western economic and military targets. This last scenario is the most
dangerous of all, potentially signifying a calculation by Putin that Russia has little
remaining stake in the global economic game. In that case, why not upend the table
and ruin the party for everyone?

2

Local Instability: Frozen Conflict with a Topping of Cyber

In the least aggressive scenario, Putin would escalate only within Ukraine in an
attempt to further destabilise and delegitimise the existing government. The ‘little
green bytes’ might deny service to Ukrainian government and media sites, or even
target critical infrastructure. As in other post-Soviet frozen conflicts, the goal is not
necessarily to prevail, but rather to keep Ukraine destabilised for years and unable
to pose any challenge.
As noted elsewhere in this book, the Russians, due to their legacy from the Moscow-dominated Soviet Union, have an extensive knowledge of Ukrainian systems.
Most of Ukraine’s infrastructure is well understood – if not designed by – Russian
enterprises, so exploiting them for cyber attack would be far easier than for a typical
cyber campaign elsewhere. There may also be a sufficient number of insiders who
are friendly to Russia, and who could either be bribed or blackmailed into leaking sensitive government materials, disseminating propaganda, installing malicious
software, or even physically destroying key systems.
Russia has shown some of its digital arsenal. Cyber espionage campaigns such
as ‘Sandworm’ have played a role in intelligence collection operations against the
Ukrainian government and some NATO nations, even taking advantage of multiple
zero-day exploits.2
The local instability cyber option could allow Putin to maintain pressure on
Ukraine while avoiding an increase in tensions with the West. He might even be

154

able to accomplish this while claiming to be de-escalating the conflict. Russia, in this
scenario, would only launch disruptive cyber attacks within Ukraine, not against
other targets in the West, and attempting to limit the upper bound of escalation. The
international community might be happy, however, to countenance a ‘cyber war’
in Ukraine if it caused little tangible damage to other countries, limited the body
count, and generated fewer disturbing media images.

3

Intimidation: Cyber Provocations and Escalation

A second option for Putin is to send a digital warning shot across the West’s cyber bow,
in effect saying that Russia has additional cards up its sleeve and may play them if necessary. Russia is already escalating all sorts of military operations against the West, from
massive exercises and military flights to nuclear threats. ‘Little green bytes’ could therefore be just one additional form of provocation to add instability on the world stage.
Such attacks would be just-deniable-enough and might target defence and military systems and networks. Russia could target allies with weaker defences, or governments which Putin might calculate as being easier political prey, and more susceptible to Russian coercion.
This cyber escalation would simply be a natural extension of Putin’s provocative behaviour in other military forces. In the last fifteen months, Russia has apparently sneaked submarines into Swedish and Finnish territorial waters, stating that
Finland’s growing ties with NATO were a ‘special concern’;3 flown jet fighters and
nuclear-capable bombers along the periphery of Europe; and buzzed NATO ships
including the US guided-missile destroyer USS Ross as it sailed in international
waters off the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula.4
Apart from drilling his conventional forces, Putin in the spring of 2014 organised large-scale exercises designed to assess the preparedness level of his nuclear
forces.5 In the context of Russia’s nuclear threats against Denmark, these appear
to be calculated (if clumsy) efforts to
intimidate the West.6

the Estonian government decided to move a Soviet war memorial from the centre of
its capital Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of town, Russia responded
by encouraging ‘patriotic hackers’ to engage in a three week long Distributed Denial-Of-Service (DDoS) attack against numerous sectors of the Estonian economy
including the government, media, and financial institutions.7 This template relies
on a combination of threats, cyber capabilities, the use of proxies, and plausible
deniability.
Russia might alternately hold off on such disruptive attacks in favour of increasingly aggressive espionage. In fact, it seems an escalation in such intrusions is
already underway.
Russian state-sponsored hackers are believed to have recently compromised the
US Department of State, then used that access to penetrate the unclassified network
of the Executive Office of the President.8,9 Unlike during previous intrusions linked
to Russia, on this occasion the digital spies did not back out of the system once they
were discovered, but fought back in order to maintain their foothold in the network.10 Investigators also believe that Russian spies were behind the recent intrusion
into the unclassified email of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, an intrusion which forced the
Pentagon to take the system down for several days.11

Freezing the Conflict in Cyberspace

Rather than, or in addition to, using cyber to help destabilise the Ukraine, Putin
might try to make the internet itself a new zone of frozen conflict. This option is
perhaps not as likely as the others, but might offer Putin an intriguing possibility:
inflict on the internet, which delivers ‘harmful’ content in the form of unwanted
truths to Russian citizens, just enough long-term disruption so that it is less useful,
less trusted, and less an enabler to Western economies and societies.
In this option, Putin’s forces would use cyber capabilities to periodically disrupt
core internet infrastructure such as the domain name system, or frequently take
down Western information providers. Each new week could see a large-scale denial-of-service attack.
This option differs from the previous ‘intimidation’ option in two ways. First,
the attacks would be far more disruptive than mere shows of force. Compared to

the intimidation option where Russia threatens force to avoid a conflict, in this frozen-conflict option, Putin already accepts Western nations as adversaries. The goal
is therefore not to get them to back down, but hopefully to destabilise the internet
just enough to deny cyber benefits to his perceived enemies.

Coercion: Escalate to De-escalate

The most aggressive option for Putin
What if, Sony-style, one bank a

tive and embarrassing attack?
a massive, long-term and continuing
attack against the West’s financial system or power grids. What if, Sony-style, one bank a week were to be targeted for a
disruptive and embarrassing attack?
Russia in the past had, along with at least the United States and China, the capability to conduct such attacks, but lacked the intent. Russia had disagreements with
the West but was not engaged in any real conflict. Further, to some extent, Russia
needed healthy Western economies to itself thrive.
That situation has changed. Today, Putin may well see himself in a conflict with
the West, perhaps even a shooting war, and feel the very survival of his regime
could be at stake. In 2013, sanctions including asset freezes and export prohibitions pushed Russia to the brink of a recession, and the economy grew by only
1.3%.12 By the end of 2015, the World Bank predicts that ongoing sanctions coupled with the decrease in oil prices will shrink the Russian economy by 3.8%.13
Putin could calculate that Russia has few remaining stakes in the global economy
and financial system.
Without international economic entanglement, it is far easier for Putin to use
Russia’s impressive cyber capabilities to try to directly coerce (rather than threaten)
the West. By inflicting economic turmoil, he could turn Russia’s lack of a stake in the
global financial system from a liability into an asset. With nothing to lose and everything to gain, Putin might calculate that unleashing his just-deniable-enough ‘little
green bytes’ against Western economies could be a win-win situation for Russia.
Russia is already pushing the idea that they may need to ‘escalate to de-escalate’
a brewing conflict with the West. In an extensive article in Vox, Max Fisher lays out
the evidence that the world is ever closer to conflict, even a world war, and especially
that Putin ‘has enshrined, in Russia’s official nuclear doctrine, a dangerous idea no
Soviet leader ever adopted: that a nuclear war could be winnable’.14

157

In that light, cyber weapons may offer an even more attractive opportunity given
that cyber effects can be temporary and reversible. Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Dmitry Rogozin has already declared that Russian tanks ‘don’t need visas’ to cross
international borders.15 If Russia is willing to make nuclear threats and roll T-72s across
borders, then how much more likely are attacks using faster, more deniable, electrons?
One obvious target would be Western financial firms that currently enforce the
sanctions against Russia. Many analysts believe that Iran chose precisely this form
of retaliation in 2012, in response to Stuxnet.16 Other obvious targets could be the
oil, gas, or electricity sectors, in order to raise the price of oil.
During our research for this chapter, several security analysts stated that Russia
may be preparing for this contingency with its Havex and BlackEnergy cyber campaigns.17 In both cases, Russian government hackers apparently targeted Western
energy companies, not for espionage, but in order to prepare for a potential follow-on disruptive attack. It appears Russia has proved that it has the required capabilities already in place to disrupt Western energy systems, now it is just a matter of
having the intent.
Or Putin could focus his cyber attack not against sectors, but against specific
Western allies; those he felt would be most likely to submit to coercive pressure. His
whispered promise might be something along the lines of ‘Drop your support for
sanctions and all these cyber failures you’re experiencing can just go away.’ Countries which might not have been fully committed to the sanctions in the first place
might not need much convincing.

6

Conclusion

Cyberspace – and cyber attacks – offer many ways, especially for a capable nationstate, to target an adversary. In the current conflict, the most likely near-term options
for Russia are perhaps local instability, intimidation and coercion. Of course, the
scenarios discussed in this chapter are not mutually exclusive; Putin could jump
between them or even employ them all simultaneously.
Fortunately to help analyse Russia’s cyber current actions, it may be enough to
analyse his actions in the physical world: Russian hostility in Europe is likely to be
matched with Russian hostility online. If this process starts to get out of control,
then Western leaders have to be at their highest level of concern.
If Putin believes he is approaching a use-it-or-lose-it situation for his autocratic
regime and its stolen billions, he may just decide to take the internet down with him.

Strategic Defence
in Cyberspace:
Beyond Tools and Tactics

Introduction

The digitisation of information, which began during the Second World War, has
significantly deepened the relationship between human beings (from the individual to the nation-state) and unstructured data, structured information (such as a
databases), and intelligence (information of political or military value). Every part
of society has benefited from information technology; however, as we have increasingly become data-reliant, our adversaries have sought to leverage information
against us. Attackers and defenders now battle for access to, and control of, information in the political, economic, military, and social spheres. In military parlance,
data has become a virtual ‘high ground’ from which the better-informed can influence an adversary.
The Ukrainian Government currently finds itself at a tactical disadvantage vis-à-vis
Russia, both on the traditional field of battle as well as in cyberspace. However, cyber
security, especially at the national level, is a strategic game, and Kyiv can make smart
investments that will pay off over the long run. In Ukraine, as in every other nationstate, practitioners, academics, policy-makers, and the public are individually and collectively vexed by the question of how to defend data, information, and intelligence.
Part of the problem is that adversaries do not have one or even several attack strategies
at their disposal: they can steal, destroy, deny access to, or even alter information – as
well as the systems that store, process, and display it to its ostensible owners.

159

Digitised information is a human product which resides in mechanical devices
built by engineers and programmers, and so decision-makers naturally turn to the
technical community for answers to these challenges. Technical proposals take
many forms. Several frequently appear in policy-making circles: we could scrap the
internet entirely and replace it with a ‘more secure’ alternative;1 we might build
software that is ‘not hackable,’ possibly through ‘leap ahead’ technologies that make
defence easier than offense (which is today manifestly not the case);2 or we can outsource our security to third-party vendors.3 These are all technical ideas, but they
are generally not feasible for a variety of reasons. More fundamentally, it is dangerous to rely solely on technology to mitigate core security problems.

2

The Limitations of Technology-driven Approaches

Technology plays an important role in defending data. Thoughtfully designed
networks, higher quality software, and agile start-ups can frustrate opportunistic
intruders seeking easy prey. Unfortunately, well-resourced, professional attackers
sometimes have long-standing missions to compromise specific high-value targets,
whether for information theft or data manipulation. They will not give up until their
mission requirements change or until they succeed in their assignment.
Digital defenders may only get a glimpse of the intruder, and often this comes
far too late in the game. Whereas the victim’s perspective is usually narrow and
incomplete, professional attackers are persistent and know exactly what they are
targeting. According to the Mandiant 2015 M-Trends report, the median number of
days in 2014 that a successful threat group was present on a victim’s network before
detection, was 205. In one case, an adversary had maintained unauthorised access
for over 8 years.4 Even after discovery, organisations can spend months trying to
remove the intruder. In February 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US

between attackers and defenders, but in general the security community does not
sufficiently understand or appreciate the nature and consequences of this relationship. A technology-centric worldview obsesses about a static, one-time exchange
between attacker and defender. This is not an accurate description of the real world,
which is populated, not with mindless code, but with rational and irrational human
beings who are both intelligent and adaptive adversaries and who observe their targets, allocate resources, and make dynamic decisions in order to accomplish their
goals.6
Digital defenders ignore these facts at their peril. The interactive and time-dependent nature of network attack and defence leads to the promotion of suboptimal
approaches to security. The emphasis on ‘cyber hygiene’ is illustrative.7 To defeat
intruders, this method promotes knowing one’s network, removing unauthorised
systems, patching vulnerabilities, and improving configurations. All of these are
certainly both requisite and commendable defensive steps. However, they are insufficient when confronting an attacker who has the time and resources to adapt to and
overcome the target’s defences. ‘Washing cyber hands’ is helpful when minimising
the spread of mindless germs, but it is less effective when those germs are as smart
as, or better-resourced and motivated than, the hand-washer.

Strategic Thought in Cyber Defence

To better address the dynamic challenge of continuous interaction between adaptive, intelligent adversaries, this chapter advocates the application of strategic military concepts to conflict in cyberspace. Armed conflict has long been characterised
as a struggle between persistent adversaries over time. However, the advent of mass
armies, modern weapons, and nation-state warfare in the late 18th and early 19th
centuries took this concept to a higher level. During the 20th century, military strategists therefore had to think beyond the traditional dichotomy of strategy versus
tactics. Over time, they codified multiple ‘levels of warfare’.
Beginning in the 1980s, U.S. Army doctrine described three levels of war: strategic, operational, and tactical.8 These built on previous writings and lessons learned,
from Napoleonic battles to Soviet military planning. National goals and policy – sitting above the strategic level of war – were incorporated into doctrine, although this
can be confusing given that the word ‘strategic’ often appeared in both the model’s
name and one of its primary elements.

Figure 1-1 – Strategic Thought, Adapted for Digital Conflict
In this chapter, the author argues that decision-makers need to better understand
the role of technology in strategic thought, and so it adds a new level below the tactical layer: ‘tools’. Certainly in physical warfare one uses ‘tools’ to inflict kinetic damage. In the digital world, the model explicitly

tools at the bottom of the model, they appear,
in the author’s opinion, in their proper place.
Furthermore, in this model, the term ‘campaign’ is included at the operational level.
‘Campaigns’ and ‘operations’ are sometimes interchanged, so both appear to reduce
confusion.
These five levels are depicted in Figure 1‑1. Policies and goals are broad statements by organisational leadership that describe the desired purpose of the strategic programme. Strategies are concepts for employing organisational resources
to accomplish the stated policies and goals. Operations (which in this schema are
organised into campaigns) are sets of activities designed to implement strategies
that are pursued over days, weeks, months, or even years. Tactics are actions taken
within individual encounters with an adversary, and serve as the atomic elements
of a campaign. Tools are the digital equipment with which an actor implements
tactics.

162

All of these elements must be connected in order to achieve successful outcomes.
Before explaining how these five levels can improve digital defence, it is important
to recognise that I am not advocating the ‘militarisation’ of cyberspace – which is a
valid concern of many analysts. For example, in 2013, Jason Healey wrote in Foreign
Affairs that the military had ‘prioritised one national security goal – more spying
and attack capabilities – above all others’.9 A Forbes journalist defined the problem as ‘giv[ing] a military character to’ it, ‘equip[ping] [it] with military forces and
defences’ or ‘adapt[ing] [it] for military use’,10 This author, while generally disagreeing with these premises, does not equate strategic thought with militarisation. The
purpose of this chapter on strategic thought is to familiarise defenders with another
strategy to protect information, one suited to the timescales and interactive nature
of modern computer intrusions.

Traditional Security within the Strategic Model

Squaring traditional security concepts with the strategic model contributes to a rich
discussion of digital defence. Typically, network defenders concentrate on tools and
tactics, which are in turn dominated by the notions of security software, software
security, and securing software. Security software consists of programs written by
vendors, open source developers, and individual security teams that are designed
to detect, frustrate, and remove adversaries. Software security refers to the process
of writing computer programs that are free from coding, process, and logic flaws,
optimally using a process such as the Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM).11 Securing software is a process to enable the ‘cyber hygiene’ model, whereby
defenders take various tactical steps to reduce the likelihood of compromise.
Beyond the security team, one finds multiple layers of management, including
a chief security or information security officer (CSO or CISO), one or more chief
technology or information officers (CTO or CIO), other members of the so-called
‘C-suite’ including the chief financial or operating officers (CFO, COO), and ultimately the chief executive officer (CEO) and board of directors. At the nation-state
level, some governments have appointed cyber security coordinators reporting to
the head of government. Recent examples include the United States, the United
Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Japan, and France.12 In China, President Xi Jinping
personally leads the country’s top information security group.13 One would think

that, with so much focus on cyber and information security at the upper levels of
management, defence strategies would be clear. However, despite numerous recent
high-profile breaches, security leaders continue to fret that their ‘organisation’s business leadership didn’t provide them the support and space they need to secure their
organisations properly’.14
Improving the dynamics of strategic thought according to the proven military
model can help organisations and nation states move beyond a ‘tools and tactics’
focused approach. The latter is by far the prevailing paradigm. For example, one
2014 RSA Conference presentation encouraged attendees to ‘exploit pet projects’
and ‘capitalise on timely events’ by using the ‘near-death experiences of others to
justify security spend’.15 One 2015 article written for security managers stressed
the need for more capable software, stating that ‘a CISO must successfully address
many challenging elements when procuring a new security technology solution’.16
In 2014, Symantec’s Senior Vice President for Information Security said that only
45% of cyber attacks are prevented by anti-virus software, calling it a ‘dead’ technology.17 Writing secure software, while a laudable goal, continues to be difficult,
even for leading companies like Microsoft. Bill Gates accelerated the programme
to find a secure development lifecycle in 2002, but the vendor continues to release
patches for ‘remote code execution’ vulnerabilities in core Microsoft platforms on
a monthly basis. In brief, we need more than tools and tactics to counter digital
adversaries.
When trying to learn how to communicate with higher level managers and
CISOs, agency leads, and policy-makers are bombarded with advice like the following:
‘One of the most strategic skills a security chief can bring is the proficiency in translating security speak into the language of business risks
and financial ROI [return on investment] terms... At the board level, the
ability to show dollar return on security initiatives is critical to ensure
continued executive support on security investments’.18
The problem with the focus on tools and tactics, and related topics of risk and
ROI is that higher-level management and boards do not feel connected to the true
defensive posture of their organisation. Because leaders have not been valued parts
of the security program development process, they think security is mainly an issue
to be solved by technical professionals. Their experience with the IT and security

worlds has led them to approach security as an issue of approving budgets to purchase ever-more-costly security software. The Christian Science Monitor reported
the following in February 2015:
‘In a survey commissioned by defence contractor Raytheon of 1,006
chief information officers, chief information security officers, and other
technology executives, 78 percent said their boards had not been briefed
even once on their organisation’s cybersecurity strategy over the past 12
months ... The findings are similar to those reported by PricewaterhouseCoopers in its Global State of Information Security Survey last year in
which fewer that 42 percent of respondents said their board actively participates in overall security strategy’.19
In light of these challenges, this chapter
advocates making boards and higher-level
managers integral aspects of the security
process, by way of strategic thought.

Cyber Security without Strategy

The following scenario will help the reader understand how the application of strategic cyber security principles can better protect digital assets. A private organisation suffers targeted attacks by both criminal and nation-state threat groups, which
not only compromise the organisation but also steal intellectual property including
trade secrets, sensitive commercial data, and other digital resources.
The traditional ‘tools-and-tactics’ security model is characterised by suboptimal
communication and poor alignment between the management, board, and security
team. The latter, led by the CISO, is determined to counter the adversary. Their first
instinct will be to take some concrete action: to hire new personnel, to develop a
new capability, to adopt a new tactic, or to purchase a new software tool. Next, they
will attempt to translate their plan into ‘business speak’, and the CISO will develop
an argument based on an ROI estimate that includes the cost of the initiative, the
amount of money it should save (if all goes well), and a mathematical calculation of
the overall risk to the enterprise.
If asked by the CEO or board to explain his or her rationale, the CISO will reply
that a tools-and-tactics approach will save the enterprise money and reduce its level
of risk. Finally, the management will give the proposal a green light, or send the
CISO back to the drawing board.

165

This budget request cycle is repeated ad nauseam, until management gets wise to
the fact that network security ROI seems to have an Alice-in-Wonderland quality
about it: the more money they spend, the more money they are supposed to save.
Eventually, management realises that security is a lot more about loss prevention
than revenue generation, and they begin to feel disconnected (and disaffected) from
the defence of their digital resources. Further, they recognise that their organisation
is one of many whose boards are not briefed on real strategy, and who have in fact
never participated in serious strategy formulation.

Strategic Cyber Security

A strategic cyber security programme, by contrast, does not begin with tools and
tactics, but with an articulation of one or more programme goals. First, the strategy-minded CISO gets executive buy-in to those goals. To that end, the CISO must
incorporate all levels of strategic thought, starting with the board and CEO – everyone must feel ownership and participation. The smart CISO recognises that security
is a journey, not a destination, and that relationship building requires an ability to
translate between technical and non-technical vocabularies.
The CISO ensures that the programme goals accurately govern the objectives of
the enterprise’s digital security programme. In our scenario, the CISO, board, and
CEO all agree that, with respect to intellectual property, trade secrets, and sensitive
data, the new policy goal is to minimise loss due to intrusion. This statement implies
that everyone understands that stopping all adversaries and all attacks is simply
not possible, especially when dealing with nation-state actors and some advanced
criminal groups.
The primary objective of this exercise is to achieve consensus on a simply stated,
non-technical programme goal. No in-depth technical discussion is needed to
achieve consensus, although the CISO
must ensure that all goals, policies, and

paigns and, if necessary, acquire new tools
and tactics to facilitate them. Together, they decide to implement a network security
monitoring (NSM) operation, defined as the collection and escalation of indications
and warnings to detect and respond to intruders.20 The security team begins the
long-term, strategic process of hunting for hostile cyber attack campaigns, encompassing both known and unknown intrusion patterns.
20

166

The CISO, board, and CEO all agree that a second programme goal is the rapid
detection, response, and containment of cyber threats. This goal helps to ensure that
when intruders breach the perimeter defences, the game is far from over. Defenders
can still win, so long as they contain the threat before the attacker can accomplish his
or her ultimate mission. Therefore, the security team will develop strategies to identify
compromises quickly, determine their nature, give them some level of attribution, and
above all develop a plan to stop the attacker from accomplishing his or her mission.
At the tactical level of individual engagements with the adversary – the equivalent of battles in war – the security team will have myriad decisions to make, including whether to dislodge the intruder immediately or whether to watch the intruder
for a time in order to collect valuable intelligence. Some tactics govern how specific
tools or techniques can be used, such as when Star Trek personnel switch their hand
phasers between ‘stun’ and ‘kill’. As always, the adversary gets a say in what happens,
but from the enterprise’s point of view, programme goals, policies, and guidelines
should be written to govern this entire process.

The Relevance of Campaigns

Central to the concept, and success, of a strategic security program is the campaign,
which functions at the operational level. In some sense, the maturity of a security
programme can be derived from the attention shown by the CISO and his or her
security team to campaign development, and the understanding of campaign progress and analysis by top management. Consider the following quote from a February 2015 Reuters report on defence contractor Lockheed Martin:
‘[Chief Executive Officer Marillyn] Hewson told the company’s annual
media day that Lockheed had faced 50 ‘coordinated, sophisticated campaign’ attacks by hackers in 2014 alone, and she expected those threats to
continue growing’.21
When Ms. Hewson spoke in terms of campaigns, she showed that her security team
thinks and works at an advanced level. It is likely that Lockheed also aligns campaigns
with specific threat actors and motives. Speaking about specific campaigns and ranking
them in terms of sophistication and impact permits a vastly more meaningful discussion with other executives, the board, and other stakeholders. The CEO should be able
to speak in detail about the threat actors behind the campaigns, including their means
and motives, as well as illustrative examples of each campaign and how the security team
detected and responded to them. The term ‘campaign’ also matches well with non-technology business operations such as marketing campaigns and sales campaigns.

167

Contrast this approach with a recent briefing by Japan’s National Institute of
Information and Communications Technology, which appeared in the Japan Times:
‘The number of computer attacks on government and other organisations
detected in Japan doubled in 2014 from the previous year to a record 25.66
billion, a government agency said Tuesday’.22
Discussing individual attacks has limited value, as discrete incidents include
everything from a suspicious TCP packet, to an odd computer port, dubious SQL
query, or ‘phishy’ email. On the other hand, how can anyone devise a credible programme goal to counter over 25 billion attacks? The sweet spot lies in the middle, in
grouping the primary threats and threat actors into coherent and logical campaigns.
This is the best way for the enterprise – or a nation state – to counter an interactive
and adaptive adversary.

The government of Ukraine, which has tense relations with Russia and is embroiled
in an ongoing war, is likely the target for many ongoing cyber attack campaigns.

cyber espionage campaign (active since
2013) designed to provide a ‘military advantage’ to Russia by targeting Ukrainian
government, law enforcement, and military officials for information of intelligence value. The researchers found a ‘direct correlation’ between digital attacks
and the ongoing war, including an ‘alarming’ blend of cyber espionage, physical warfare, and geopolitics.23 Recent reports by security companies Trend Micro
and FireEye describe other Russian campaigns, assigned the monikers ‘Operation
Pawn Storm’ and ‘APT28’, respectively.24 According to FireEye, APT28 appeared
to target individuals affiliated with European security organisations, including

rity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which the Russian Government has long
cited as existential threats.25
Similarly, Russian non-government groups such as CyberBerkut have been active
against NATO and Ukrainian targets.26 In March 2014, the group directed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against NATO’s main website, the CCD COE
website, and NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly website.27 In October 2014, on the
eve of parliamentary elections in Ukraine, the website of the country’s Central Election Commission suffered DDoS attacks.28 The group has apparently also targeted
US military contractors working in Ukraine, stealing and publishing documents
about the movement of Western military equipment to Ukraine.29
Nation state security requirements are strategic in nature, and they do not frequently change. For what is seen to be a valid national security concern, states will
devote enormous human and technological resources to achieve their objectives,
and use a variety of methods and attack vectors. Neither does a state give up after
one or even a hundred unsuccessful tactical engagements. Rather, it will adapt, and
usually overcome defences eventually. The key factor that sets nation states apart
from individuals and even hacker groups like Anonymous is persistence, and the
ability to maintain persistence indefinitely.
Actors such as Russia also qualify as highly ‘advanced’. Here is the author’s working definition, published in 2009:
‘Advanced means the adversary can operate in the full spectrum of computer
intrusion. They can use the most pedestrian publicly available exploit against
a well-known vulnerability, or they can elevate their game to research new vulnerabilities and develop custom exploits, depending on the target’s posture’.30
Recognising that any nation-state – in this case Russia – has the capability to
adapt and overcome is one reason why threat attribution is so important, at all levels
of strategic thought.31 This means that any time the security team recognises a failed
intrusion attempt as coming from an advanced persistent threat actor, they can be
sure the foe will return with a new technique and perhaps even a new campaign.

Conclusion

The Ukrainian Government currently finds itself at a tactical disadvantage vis-à-vis
Russia, both on the traditional field of battle and in cyberspace. However, cyber
security, especially at the national level, is a strategic game, and Kyiv can make smart
investments that will pay off over the long run.

tary model in cyberspace, albeit without any
desire for the militarisation of cyberspace.
The author explained how the military mind set, based on conflict with dynamic,
adaptive adversaries, is a more reliable strategy than the popular ‘cyber hygiene’
model. It then described the five levels of strategic thought, which link goals with
policy, strategy, campaigns and operations, tactics, and tools. The author applied
each level of strategic thought to a hypothetical network defence scenario. By integrating strategic thought into digital defence, this chapter demonstrated an alternative to technology-centric approaches that are not sufficient to defeat the adversary.
In a time of war, Ukraine is a natural target for many cyber threat actors and
campaigns. The only way to counter them is to develop an equally determined
defensive posture in cyber space.
