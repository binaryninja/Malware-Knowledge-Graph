China-Based APT Mustang Panda Targets Minority Groups,
Public and Private Sector Organizations
anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-

Overview
The Anomali Threat Research Team has identiﬁed an ongoing campaign which it believes is
being conducted by the China-based threat group, Mustang Panda. The team ﬁrst revealed these
ﬁndings on Wednesday, October 2, during Anomali Detect 19, the company’s annual user
conference, in a session titled: “Mustang Panda Riding Across Country Lines.”
CrowdStrike researchers ﬁrst published information on Mustang Panda in June 2018, after
approximately one year of observing malicious activities that shared unique Tactics, Techniques,
and Procedures (TTPs).[1] This campaign dates back to at least November 2018. The research
does not indicate with absolute certainty which entities are being targeted or the impact the
campaign has had. Based on the lure documents observed by Anomali, we believe that the
following may be targeted:
Individuals interested in the United Nations’ Security Council Committee resolutions
regarding the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL / Da’esh)
Mongolian-based MIAT Airlines
Non-proﬁt China Center (China-Zentrum e.V.); according to its website, this ofﬁcially
recognized nonproﬁt organization’s aim is to foster encounters and exchange between
cultures and religions in the West and in China
Targeted countries including but not limited to Germany, Mongolia, Myanmar (Burma),
Pakistan, Vietnam
The Communist Party of Vietnam (CVP)

China-Based APT Mustang Panda Targets Minority Groups, Public and Private Sector Organizations | Anomali

The Shan Tai; a group of people living in Southeast Asia, which Minority Rights Group
International describes as a “minority” in the region, with members who are primarily
Theravada Buddhists
The malicious activity found by Anomali aligns with TTPs, speciﬁcally two through six, ﬁrst
identiﬁed by CrowdStrike. The observed TTPs consist of the following:
1. Use of zip ﬁle that contains a “.lnk” (Windows Shortcut) ﬁle.
2. Utilization of double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to convince users to open the ﬁle.
3. HTA (HTML Application) with VBScript embedded in the “.lnk” ﬁle
4. VBScript drops payloads and opens a decoy document or PDF to the user.
5. Usage of PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads.[2]
The infection chain observed by Anomali researchers in this campaign is shown below in Figure
1.

Figure 1 – Infection vector
We also found similarities in targeting in Mongolia and an NGO. The use of United Nations’
documents regarding activities in the Middle East may also be indicative of think-tank targeting.
Furthermore, the use of PlugX malware also aligns with CrowdStrike’s previous ﬁndings of activity
attributed to Mustang Panda.[3]
Analysts’ note: The language capabilities to read some of the lure documents is not available
within Anomali at this time. We would encourage those with the language skills necessary to
analyze the documents further.

Targeting
In mid-August 2019, the Anomali Threat Research Team discovered suspicious “.lnk” ﬁles during
routine intelligence collection. While the distribution method of these documents cannot be
conﬁrmed at this time, it is likely that spearphishing is being utilized because it aligns with
Mustang Panda’s TTPs, and it is a common tactic used amongst APT actors. The lure documents
are also too speciﬁc in their targeting, and the targeted entities and individuals would be of
interest to a China-sponsored threat group.

Further analysis of the ﬁles led to the identiﬁcation of other “.lnk” ﬁles that were attempting to
infect individuals with a Cobalt Strike Beacon (penetration-testing tool) or PlugX (Remote Access
Tool (RAT); other payloads were unable to be identiﬁed as of this writing. Anomali researchers
identiﬁed 15 malicious documents that we believe were utilized by Mustang Panda in an ongoing
campaign. The documents reveal malicious activity dating from at least November 2018 up to
August 29, 2019. The date of this activity is conﬁrmed by the VirusTotal (VT) submission dates,
which will be analyzed further in the following sections. In addition, the dates within the
documents go back as far as October 8, 2017, therefore, it is possible this activity goes back to
2017 if the group was using current content in their lures. The primary target of this campaign
were found to be the ruling political party of Vietnam, The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV);
other targets observed in the malicious documents include the following:
CPV of Lang Son province, Vietnam
CPV of Lao Cai province, Vietnam
Embassy of Vietnam, China
Henan Provincial Party Committee, Vietnam
Individuals who would ﬁnd United Nations’ documents of interest, potentially think tanks
MIAT Airlines, Mongolian airline
Police of Sindh Province, Pakistan
Restoration Council of Shan State / Shan State Army, Loi Tai Leng, Southern Shan State,
Myanmar (Burma)
The China Center (China Zentrum e.V), Germany
The lure documents are themed to be relevant to their targets, and in some cases are copies of
legitimate documents that are publicly available. The “.lnk” ﬁles being utilized by Mustang Panda
typically contain an embedded HTA script that, once executed, will drop and open the decoy
document while the malicious activity of the payload runs in the background. Other lure
documents are themed to be relevant to their targets, and in some cases are legitimate
documents that are publicly available. The ﬁnal type of malicious document we observed were
empty, and only contain an image, such as requesting for macros to be enabled, used to distract
someone while malicious activity takes place in the background.

Figure 2 – TCO BT574.doc
As seen above, this document is addressed to the Embassy of Vietnam in China. The document
appears to discuss a warning issued to the Vietnam government related to a military exercise on
a set of coordinates. Speciﬁcally, the document informs that no civilian ships are allowed on said
coordinates. The document continues and mentions a new ice-breaking ship called “Snow
Dragon 2” and mentions August 15, 2019, as the beginning of a 35-day trial run. This document
indicates a regional interest with speciﬁcity.

Mustang Panda is using this decoy document, dated August 15, 2019, to target the People’s
Committee Lang Son Province. The Peoples’ Committee is the executive branch of a Vietnamese
province.[4] The Lang Son province shares a border with China’s Guangxi Province. The area has
historically served as an important location for trade, and therefore control over the location has

Figure 4 – Daily News (19-8-2019)
This document appears to be targeting the Shan Tai people by using a document referencing the
Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS). The Shan Tai people make up the largest minority
group in Myanmar (Burma) and are located in Northwestern and Eastern Myanmar (Burma) and
the Yunnan province in China.[7] The RCSS, also referred to as Shan State Army (SSA), is a
government/political organization that is headquartered in Loi Tai Leng, Southern Shan state, in
present-day Myanmar (Burma), bordering Thailand.[8] The targeting of minority groups is a known
tactic used by the government of the People’s Republic of China.

Mustang Panda retrieved this document from the United Nations Digital Library that is titled
“Letter dated 15 January 2019 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established
pursuant to Resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) concerning Islamic State in
Iraq and the Levant (Da'esh), Al-Qaida and Associated Individuals, Groups, Undertakings and
Entities addressed to the President of the Security Council.”[9]
At the time of this writing, it is unknown who, or what this document may be targeting. However,
think-tank organizations may be interested in such a document, and said organizations were
found to be targets of Mustang Panda by CrowdStrike.[10]

“European.doc” is targeting The China Center (China Zentrum e.V) is, according to its website, a
non-proﬁt organization that “encourages encounters and exchange between cultures and
religions in the West and in China. The members of the China-Zentrum are Catholic aid
organizations, religious orders and dioceses in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy.”[11]
Targeting of NGOs was ﬁrst documented by CrowdStrike and we believe we have observed
Mustang Panda attempting to attack a similar type of target.[12] In addition, an institution focused
on exchanging cultural knowledge aligns with China’s strategic interests.

Targeting Pakistan
Upon pivoting from the C2 domain apple-net[.]com, observed in the other samples that are part of
the campaign, Anomali found a malicious sample that targets the Police of the Sindh Province in
Pakistan. The PlugX malware has been observed as the payload that is targeting the Sindh
Province police.

Technical Analysis
The “.lnk” ﬁles being utilized by MustangPanda typically contain an embedded HTA ﬁle with
VBscript or PowerShell script that, once executed, will drop and open the decoy document while
malicious activity of the payload runs in the background. Throughout the campaign we observed
PlugX and Cobalt Strike being delivered as the primary payloads.

“.lnk” File Analysis
In Windows “.lnk” is the ﬁle extension for shortcut ﬁles which points to an executable ﬁle. “.lnk”
ﬁles usually holds plenty of forensic artifacts and they can reveal valuable information about the
threat actor’s environment. The metadata from the “.lnk” ﬁles led us to pivot to more samples from
the same campaign.

Once the user opens the “.lnk” ﬁle, the embedded HTA ﬁle will be executed via “mshta.exe”, it
then writes a PowerShell script name “3.ps1” in the “%TEMP%” directory. The PowerShell script
is then executed using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in a hidden window via WMI
Tasks.[13]

The dropped ﬁle “3.ps1” is a base64 encoded PowerShell script. Upon execution it performs the
below operations on the target host:
1. Checks if the user has Administrator privilege
2. Drops the Cobalt Strike Stager in debug or “%TEMP%” directory as “tmp_FlVnNI.dat”
depending on the user privilege
3. Opens the decoy Word document
4. Locates the InstallUtil.exe and its installed version
5. Copies “schtasks.exe” to “%TEMP%” directory and renames it to “wtask.exe”
6. Creates Scheduled tasks with the name “Security Script kb00855787”

During our analysis, we could not acquire the second stage payload as the C2 servers were not
functioning or had been taken down by the threat actors.

PlugX Payload Analysis
“.lnk” ﬁles that used PlugX as the payload were abnormally big in size. In general, the “.lnk” ﬁles
are less than 10Kb, but the malicious samples in the campaign were more than 700Kb. Upon
taking a closer look we found that the “.lnk” ﬁles were embedded with 3 base64 encoded
executables.
Upon opening the LNK ﬁle, it will then proceed to execute the below command via cmd.exe.
command: /c for %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do for /f "delims==" %i in ('dir "%x\tieu luan ve quyen

The command executes the HTA ﬁle embedded inside the shortcut and it decodes and drops 3
executables in the “%TEMP%” directory and opens a decoy word document to the user.

Conclusion
The malicious operations conducted by Mustang Panda in this campaign appear to be ongoing.
The targets, indicated by speciﬁc lure documents, are government or align strategically with a
China-sponsored APT group. China is currently in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) that focus
on the following themes: innovation, coordinated development, green growth, openness, and
inclusive growth, respectively.[14] The objective of increasing exports and speciﬁc imports, which
falls under openness, would align with the targeting of the Lang Son province and its history of
trade. Utilizing lures themed around political parties, the Sindh police, and UN documents would
align with innovation, which is described “as the cornerstone of China’s development strategy”
and attempts of “enhancing its future global competitiveness and technological edge.”[15]

Targeting entities, or related entities, of said lures indicates a potential regional interest in
strategic information that may be of signiﬁcance to a government. In addition, the TTPs observed
by CrowdStrike are identical to the ones observed by Anomali.
This activity has been ongoing since at least November 2018, and possibly as far back to at least
October 2017 if the lure documents were distributed around the times mentioned in them. This
kind of malicious activity sponsored by China will likely continue as the country expands its efforts
for the ongoing Belt and Road Initiative that seeks to invest in infrastructure in over 100 countries.
Such economic and investment-led initiatives will cause China to be more interested in the
regions its investing in, therefore it is likely that APT-related activity will follow.
