April 29, 2022

In the world of cybersecurity and threat intelligence, understanding what threats you might
face next is critical to effectively securing your network. The Common Vulnerability Scoring
System (CVSS) has been a valuable tool in this fight because it highlights how exploitable
different vulnerabilities are. And now, EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) can
supplement CVSS by providing dynamic insight into the likelihood that a vulnerability will be
exploited. It produces a probability score of a rational number between 0.0 and 1.0, and the
higher the score, the greater the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited.
In this blog, I will review the CVSS scoring system used worldwide to prioritize software
vulnerabilities. I will also highlight best practices for using CVSS at its full potential, which,
unfortunately, few companies leverage.

I will then introduce EPSS, a new score that can predict the likelihood of exploitation of
software vulnerabilities, and describe how it should be used in conjunction with CVSS to
prioritize vulnerability patching. I will also illustrate why EPSS is more dynamic than CVSS
using a popular vulnerability published last year that affected the library Log4j.
Finally, I will describe how Fortinet supports the calculation of EPSS scores by providing the
daily telemetry data needed to establish the “Ground Truth” for the probabilistic training of the
model.

Intro to CVSS
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework for communicating
the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS is owned and managed by
FIRST.Org, Inc. (FIRST), a US-based non-profit organization. Its mission is to assist
computer security incident response teams worldwide. The official CVSS documentation can
be found at https://www.first.org/cvss/.
Two common uses of CVSS are calculating a CVSS rating, or score, that attempts to provide
a standardized measurement of the severity of vulnerabilities discovered on one's systems
and as a factor in the prioritization of vulnerability remediation activities. While this is an
invaluable tool for threat assessment, the only public entity that produces consistent and
reliable CVSS scores is the NVD Database, which is widely adopted as a reference source
for many private and public companies worldwide.
Let's take a deeper look at how the CVSS operates and how those scores are computed.
Most security practitioners forget that CVSS consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal,
and Environmental. By examining these different metrics, you will better understand how
CVSS works and its value to researchers and developers.
Figure 1: CVSS Metric Groups
The Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability that are constant over time
and across user environments. These are broken down into two main groups: Exploitability
metrics, such as how complex an attack must be to exploit a vulnerability and whether the
user has to participate in the attack, and Impact metrics that address issues like
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The Temporal group reflects the characteristics of a
vulnerability that change over time, such as the maturity of available exploitation code and
the effort required for remediation. And the Environmental group looks at the characteristics
of a vulnerability that are unique to a user's environment.
The Base metrics produce a severity score ranging from 0 to 10, 10 being the most severe.
This score can then be modified by combining the Temporal and Environmental metrics. For
example, a vulnerability that might have a severe impact on a device may be downgraded

because the exploit required to take advantage of this vulnerability is just too complex to be
widely distributed. However, while this method was the authors' original intent for the CVSS
scores, most companies only use the Base Score.
Figure 2: CVSS Metrics and Equations
Generally, the Base (always available from NVD) and Temporal metrics are specified by
vulnerability bulletin analysts, security product vendors, or application vendors because they
typically possess the most accurate information about the characteristics of a vulnerability.
End-user organizations specify environmental metrics because they can best assess the
potential impact of a vulnerability within their own computing environment.
The scores are computed in sequence. The Base Score is used to calculate the Temporal
Score, and the Temporal Score is used to calculate the Environmental Score (see Figure 2
and the calculator here: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator).
Temporal metrics are very hard to track because it is a manual-intensive process and
requires analysts to be constantly aware of exploit availability and maturity, remediations
available, and the reliability of available information.
Scoring CVSS metrics also produces a vector string, a textual representation of the metric
values used to score the vulnerability. This vector string is a specifically formatted text string
that contains each value assigned to each metric and should always be displayed with the
vulnerability score.
Because of its complexity, especially the need for analysts to be constantly aware of a wide
variety of threat data, CVSS cannot be used at its full capacity by the majority of the
community. Instead, it needs to be combined with data-driven threat information, like EPSS,
to better prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts.

Introduction to EPSS
The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS https://www.first.org/epss) is an open, datadriven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be
exploited in the wild. Its goal is to assist network defenders in better prioritizing vulnerability
remediation efforts in conjunction with an existing CVSS score.
As explained above, while other industry standards such as CVSS have been helpful in
capturing the innate characteristics of a vulnerability and providing measures of severity, they
are often limited in their ability to predict the likelihood of a threat occurring. EPSS fills that
gap because it uses current threat information from the CVE database
(https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs ) combined with real-world exploit data for its
predictions. EPSS then produces a probability score of between 0 and 1 (0 and 100%). The
higher the score, the greater the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited in the next 30
days.

EPSS currently collects information from multiple data sources, usually daily, to score
threats. These sources include, but are not limited to, the following:
MITRE’s CVE List - Only CVEs in the “published” state are scored
Text-based “Tags” derived from the CVE description and other sources talking about
the vulnerability
Count of how many days a CVE has been published
Count of how many references are listed in the CVE
Published Exploit code in any of: Metasploit, ExploitDB, and/or Github
Security Scanners: Jaeles, Intrigue, Nuclei, sn1per
CVSS v3 vectors in the base score (not the score or any subscores), as published in
the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
CPE (vendor) information, as published in NVD
Ground Truth: Daily observations of exploitation-in-the-wild activity from AlienVault and
Fortinet.
The process that generates this score is based on machine learning. A simplified
representation is found in the image below:
Figure 3: Representation of score generation through machine learning
As can be seen, any EPSS deployment must first go through a training phase, where it is
given historical vulnerability data and daily exploitation activity to develop and refine its
predictive model. Once established, the predictive model can then be used in combination
with vulnerability metadata on a daily basis to predict future exploitation activity.
The resulting EPSS score can be used for such things as prioritizing which software to patch
based on a threshold, with the advantage of requiring organizations to patch fewer
vulnerabilities compared to using a patching strategy based solely on a CVSS ranking. There
is too much math involved to describe the process here, but you can go to this site to learn
more (https://www.first.org/epss/model). But the takeaway is that organizations that properly
deploy and train EPSS will need to patch fewer vulnerabilities than they would have using
the classic CVSS strategy while maintaining the same level of protection.
You are warned, though. EPSS should never be treated as a risk score. Other factors, such
as how accessible vulnerable assets are to attackers, the type of weakness a vulnerability
presents, the asset's purpose and value, etc., are all factors to consider when prioritizing
which vulnerabilities should be addressed. Fortunately, those factors are typically contained
in the string vector of the CVSS score.

Practical Example: Log4j

4/9

I will now demonstrate how EPSS tracked the probability of exploitation for the infamous
Log4j vulnerability that took the Internet by surprise this last December. The following
annotated chart shows how the EPSS score evolved over time based on specific events that
affected the dependent variables of the model.
Figure 4: Log4Shell through the eyes of EPSS
The official CVE, CVE-2021-44228 was published on December 10th, 2021. The NVD entry
is available here (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228).
Figure 5: NVD Analysis
Security analysts provided the initial CVSS scores for v2 and v3 on the 13th of December,
with a Base score of 10.0 (critical). That has not changed as of the writing of this blog.
Figure 6: NVD Analysis
EPSS published its daily scores on the morning of December 11th. Even before the CVSS
score was assigned on the 13th, it predicted the likelihood of exploitation at 0.355. In terms of
all other vulnerabilities scored on that day, Log4j scored higher than 96.8% of all CVEs.
You can see how the EPSS score changed over time based on variations of the 1,164
variables of the model. The last change was when Metasploit added the module
“exploit/multi/http/log4shell_header_injection”. That pushed its score to 0.944, the highest it
received.
Once again, it is important to note that the CVSS base score has not changed, so
organizations that relied solely on that score would not have detected this spike in risk. And
while, technically, the temporal CVSS score should have changed to reflect this difference,
there are no public tracking services for the temporal component.
The chart below shows our Fortinet telemetry following the release of the CVE-2021-44228
on 9 December 2021. We began receiving telemetry on 10 December 2021 when our IPS
engines were set to passively monitor the CVE.
The spike in detecting this signature on 13 December caused our IPS engine to be upgraded
to blocking action, ensuring that our customers were automatically protected. You can see
the very fast growth spike, reaching a peak of 31 million events on 15 December 2021,
followed by a second wave and a sudden decrease from 29 December 2021.
Figure 7: Log4j events
You can also observe that the vulnerability spread fast across the globe, reaching a peak of
207 of the 248 countries listed in our database (this list contains official countries and small
independent areas, etc., as well).

There are a few important observations about this chart: The first is that it represents a
volumetric count of all the FortiGate firewalls in our network reporting this threat telemetry.
And second, we can’t confirm whether these FortiGates were fronting an actual application
powered by Log4j. This means that we can’t be sure that of those counts, how many could
have been successful attempts of exploitation. However, we can clearly see the massive
jump on 14 December, followed by a small trail of activity.
We can compare the EPSS scores and the volume of detections together by normalizing the
magnitude, showing that the EPSS score started at 0.355 on 10 December, indicating that
there was a 35% chance in the next 30 days of exploitation of the vulnerability, and looking at
that time frame we can see that the subsequent activity ranged from 40,000 events to 31
million events.
Figure 8: EPSS scores and detection volume
Less intuitive is that when EPSS finally reached its maximum score of 94%, the exploitation
volume had already subsided. However, this is perfectly fine because the EPSS score does
not attempt to predict the volume of events but rather the binary decision of whether or not it
will be exploited.
The reader may also notice the sudden drop in volume on the last day of December. This is
quite common. We often see this when attackers see diminishing returns on a campaign and
switch to exploit other vulnerabilities. In fact, we can see this using another comparative plot,
shown below. As the orange RCE (remote code execution) was decreasing in popularity,
another one in green—which was a DOS vulnerability (denial of service)—initiated
considerable activity, which then faded out around the 6th of January 2022.
Figure 9: All Log4j Vulnerabilties
In conclusion, organizations should consider EPSS as "pre-threat intel." Of course, if they
have intel that something is being exploited (via their own telemetry sensors or OSINT), then
they should use that as an indication of activity in the wild. But for those without any
evidence of exploitation or that lack threat intel, then EPSS is a great fit.

How to use both CVSS and EPSS for prioritization?
Any given company should have a database of vulnerabilities reported daily by their security
vendors. For each vulnerability discovered, they can extract the CVE score (the base score,
as mentioned before, is available for free from NVD, and paid vendors provide the
temporal/environmental scores) and the EPSS score (via a simple API). They can then be
plotted with a scatter plot layout, as shown below.
Figure 10: EPSS score compared to CVSS Base Score (NVD)

6/9

The X-axis represents the CVSS version 3.1 score (1 to 10), and the Y-axis represents the
EPSS score (0 to 1.0). The color of the dots indicates how many vulnerabilities are
concentrated in the same spot, so darker colors indicate more, and lighter colors indicate
less.
Vulnerabilities in the bottom left represent those that have both a lower probability of being
exploited and would incur a lower severity impact to the information system. They can
therefore be deprioritized.
Vulnerabilities in the upper right quadrant, on the other hand, are the most critical kinds of
vulnerabilities as they are both more likely to be exploited and could fully compromise the
information system. They should therefore be patched first.
The best strategy to remediate those vulnerabilities is to rank them from the top right to the
bottom left, following the blue line. The defender can now spend fewer resources while
patching more vulnerabilities that are much more likely to be exploited.

How does Fortinet contribute to EPSS?
The ground truth of EPSS is derived from daily observations of exploitation-in-the-wild
activity provided by AlienVault and Fortinet.
For each vulnerability, FortiGuard Labs provides the daily count of detections (anonymized)
from our network of FortiGates distributed around the world. This is critical information for
building an accurate machine learning predictor for the exploitability score.
FortiGuard Labs also contributes to the codebase of the EPSS API in the official FIRST
repository.
FortiGuard Labs is Driving the Future of CybersecurityFortiGuard Labs has been active in
the threat intelligence industry since its founding. We contributed to developing the
STIX/TAXII protocols with MITRE and OASIS, starting back in 2012. In 2014, we co-founded
the Cyber Threat Alliance, which focuses on threat intelligence and information sharing. In
2018, we began to work with the World Economic Forum’s Centre for Cybersecurity on a
series of threat intelligence projects, including the Cybercrime ATLAS. And for the last couple
of years, FortiGuard Labs has been working with MITRE on a variety of projects to increase
the awareness and capabilities of defenders, particularly as a leading contributor to MITRE
Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense.
FortiGuard Labs has also been working with the Center for Threat-Informed Defense and its
members on a project called ATT&CK Sightings Ecosystem, which includes the “2021
ATT&CK Sightings Report.” As quoted in the report, this effort “created a picture of common
adversary behavior, including which techniques adversaries use, how their use changes over
time, and how adversaries sequence techniques. Defenders can use this information to
create a threat-informed defense against what they are most likely to see, not just the latest
cyber threat headlines.”
Fortinet also provided data sets to help train the model for the Exploit Prediction Scoring
System (EPSS) project and FortiGuard Labs has been an active participant. EPSS is an
open model for predicting the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild.
Coupled with the TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures) data we are providing through
the Threat intelligence Insider, we’re building the future of cybersecurity protections and
decision making.
