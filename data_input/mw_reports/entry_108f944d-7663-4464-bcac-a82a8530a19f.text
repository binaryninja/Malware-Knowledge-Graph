September 14, 2021

Cyble Research Labs came across a blog post on the darkweb regarding an Android Banking Trojan
named S.O.V.A during our routine threat hunting exercise. The post was made by an unknown Threat Actor
(TA) as an advertisement on the XSS.is forum. The TA also mentions that the trojan is under
development. Figure 1 shows the post by Threat Actor (TA) on the XSS.is forum.

Figure 1: Screenshot from S.O.V.A. blog in XSS.is forum
According to the post, S.O.V.A. (“owl” in Russian) is a new Android banking trojan under active
development. The TA has also mentioned that the trojan currently works on Android version 7 – 11. The
TA plans to upgrade the bot to work on Android 12 as well.
The TA is planning incorporate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man in the Middle (MiTM) and

Figure 2: APK Metadata Information
The malware sample is disguising itself as Adobe Flash player as shown in the above figure,

Manifest File Description
The fake Flash Player app requests 21 different permissions, of which the T.A. can abuse 12. The
dangerous permissions requested by the malware are listed below.
Permission Name

Table 1: APK Permission List
Upon inspecting the Android components declared in the manifest, we identified the activity class that
is initiated on starting the app from the icon. The declaration of the activity is shown in Figure 3.

3/16

Figure 3: Launcher activity declared in Manifest file
We also observed that the permissions, activity classes, and services declared in the manifest file allows
the malware to replace the Messages app on the device. Upon receiving permission to act as the
default messaging app, the S.O.V.A. trojan will be able to handle, send and receive SMS and
M.M.S. messages from the infected device. Refer to Figure 4.

Figure 4: Declaration of the permission, service, receiver for receiving SMSs and MMSs
The S.O.V.A. malware has also declared permissions to handle device notifications in the Android manifest
file. It abuses this capability to read and modify notifications received on the device. Upon enabling this,
the banking trojan will be able to intercept all notifications such as OTPs, personal messages, etc.
The permission declaration is shown in the figure below.

Figure 5: Manifest declaration for Notification listener
The figure below shows that the malware requests
the user for the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_PERMISSION. This permission allows apps to access a powerful
service running on the Android device called Accessibility Service.
4/16

Figure 6: Manifest declaration for BindAccessibility service
Accessibility Service is a background service running in the device which is used to aid users with
disabilities. Malware such as Banking trojans, Remote Access Trojans (R.A.T.s) and Spyware abuse this
service to intercept and monitor all activities happening on the device screen. Examples of this are the
ability to intercept the credentials being entered on another app.

Initial Stage Behavior
The figure below shows the various activities performed by S.O.V.A. malware.

Figure 7: Flow diagram of S.O.V.A. malware’s Initial Stage behavior
The three stages shown in Figure 7 are:
1. Prior to launch, the malware does not have any permission : No Notification listener permission and
no other dangerous permissions
1. Once the victim starts the app, the malware requests the user to enable Accessibility permission:
Upon enabling the Accessibility permission, the malware enables all the requested permissions,
hides the icon from user’s home screen, requests the victim to make the fake Flash player as the
default messaging app, and blocks the victim from accessing the malicious app’s Settings page. This
is done to restrict the user from modifying the malware’s capabilities such as permissions.

Source Code Analysis

5/16

The S.O.V.A. malware has created a background service called, RequestService, which communicates
with the Command and Control (C&C) server and performs malicious activities based on the commands
received from the server as shown below.

where C&C commands are verified
The commands from the C&C server are:

Table 2: S.O.V.A. Malware Commands List
The S.O.V.A. malware creates listeners for events on the device, such as boot complete, SMS received,
etc. The malware communicates with the C&C server whenever these listeners are triggered. The malware
also sends the details of the event along with the data as shown in code in Figure 9.

Figure 9: Code to Upload data based on Events
S.O.V.A. malware constantly monitors the device screen for targeted applications. The targeted
applications are stored in the packageList.txt file in the assets folder. The below figure shows the file with
the list of targeted apps.

7/16

Figure 10: Subset of Targeted App list in

packageList.txt
Whenever the user opens a target application, the malware creates an overlay using the WebView with the
link provided by C&C server.
The targeted apps include banking apps, cryptocurrency apps etc. The TA can also add new apps to
target based on their requirements.
The malware uses Accessibility to monitor the victim’s device screen. The code used by the malware to
monitor the screen for targeted apps is shown in the figure below.

8/16

Figure 11: Code to monitor device screen and start the overlay
The below figure shows the code create overlay screen over the targeted application.

Figure 12: Code to create overlay using WebVIew and to steal the cookie

9/16

In the overlay screen, the victim will be displayed a fake login page of the targeted application. Upon login,
the malware steals the cookies using the CookieManager and CookieSyncManager features, the code
for which is shown in Figure 12. The trojan also has the capability to send SMS messages to the number
provided by the C&C server. The code to send SMSs is shown in the below figure.

Figure 13: Code to send

SMS messages based on C&C command
The trojan registers a service for monitoring the clipboard changes. The code used by the malware for
clipboard monitoring is shown in figure 14.

Figure 14: Code to Capture Clipboard Contents
The S.O.V.A. malware also has the capability to perform DDoS attacks on a specific public
server which is provided as a command from C&C server. The target of the DDoS attacks is shared by the
TA.
The malware hides the C&C server URL using Base64 encoding as shown in the below figure.
Figure 15: C&C URL encoded using
Base64
C&C Server URL: hxxp://a0545193.xsph[.]ru
10/16

The C&C endpoint methods used by the S.O.V.A. malware:
/api – Main API endpoint method
/keylog.php – Keylog stealing method
/testpost.php – send stolen cookies
/logpost.php – send logs
The below code shows the C&C endpoint methods used by the malware

Figure 16: Code with C&C Endpoint methods
We also observed that the malware author is planning include Telegram
as C&C. This behavior is similar to the recent Banking Trojan called Aberebot. The code below
shows the Telegram API URL included in the malware.

Conclusion
According to our research, there is a substantial increase in the amount of Android Banking
Trojans emerging of late. We have also observed that the malware authors are incorporating
new technology to steal information and money from victims. S.O.V.A. is the latest example of this shift in
trends.
S.O.V.A. malware uses the same techniques used by other Android Banking Trojans such as Aberebot,
Cerberus etc. Alongside being a Banking Trojan, the new trojan offers the capability to
perform DDoS attacks, cookie stealing, hiding notifications etc,. The author has mentioned that they plan
to incorporate other dangerous features such as ransomware.
These trojans can be avoided by following some basic cyber hygiene practices on mobile devices.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some of the essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
