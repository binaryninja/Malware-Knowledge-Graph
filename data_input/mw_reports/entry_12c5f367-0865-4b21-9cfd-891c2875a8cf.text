A few years ago, the cryptocurrency world shook under an onslaught of scammers who
wanted to cash in on the outage of the popular messenger Telegram. Within a few hours, 5
crypto wallets advertised through a fake Twitter account supposedly belonging to Pavel

2/11

Durov received 148.364636 ETH, which is equivalent to about $60,000 at the exchange rate
on the reporting date.
Everything happened very fast. Just hours after Telegram first started experiencing technical
issues on March 29, 2018, two identical tweets posted by the scammers posing as the
founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, appeared on a discussion thread in his official Twitter
account. The tweets referred to a special promotion as part of an "apology campaign" to
compensate users for the messenger's outage, thereby luring many of Durov's subscribers to
a fake account.
In a shockingly similar case, last March, a man in Britain lost half a million dollars. This time
scammers impersonated Elon Musk posting in a thread in his official Twitter account.
These all are typical example of a scam called a Fake Crypto Giveaway. This is how it
usually plays out: fake Twitter accounts supposedly belonging to celebrities (crypto
enthusiasts in most cases) promise users to double their cryptocurrency payments sent to
the wallets, in reality controlled by the scammers. However, the platform keeps improving its
mechanisms to better detect and block rogue schemes. It forces scammers to look for
alternative ways to monetize their fraudulent operations.
As such, the scammers started using fake crypto-celebrity streams on YouTube. Similarly to
the examples featuring fake Pavel Durov and Elon Musk accounts, YouTube stream viewers
are encouraged to transfer cryptocurrency to scammers' wallets, with a promise of receiving
double the amount in return. All the streams promote a link to a fake website designed to
show visitors the mechanism behind a fake giveaway.
The scheme described in this research allowed crypto scammers to attract 165,000 viewers
to their fake YouTube streams. The analysis of crypto wallets, controlled by the scammers,
showed that they walked away with more than $1,680,000, receiving 281 transactions within
three days of monitoring. Below we describe how it all happened…

The wrong Vitalik
Between February 16 and 18, 2022, Group-IB Digital Risk Protection (DRP) experts
detected 36 fraudulent YouTube streams promising profitable cryptocurrency investments.
Those were the videos of famous crypto enthusiasts cut from legitimate streams and edited
to create the fake ones. In one case, in order to attract viewers to a fake giveaway and make
them believe that the stream was legitimate, fraudsters used a very well-known name in the
crypto world: Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.

The tactic is not new, but apparently is still having a moment. Other famous names, that the
scammers exploited as part of the latest wave, were Elon Musk, Brad Garlinghouse,
Michael J. Saylor, Changpeng Zhao, and Cathie Wood.
During fake YouTube streams, crypto celebrities discuss current cryptocurrency trading
volumes, show graphs indicating the growth of various metrics, and repeatedly refer to
enormous profits. On average, such fake streams attracted between 3,000 and 18,000
viewers. The victims are encouraged to visit a website that contains all the information
required to make a transaction and that explains why a transfer should be made immediately.
A stream featuring a fake footage of Vitalik Buterin attracted more than 165,000 viewers who
were promised that their crypto savings would be doubled in real time if they transferred
tokens to a crypto wallet, which in reality was controlled by the fraudsters. Some of them
could be bots to make people believe that the stream was legitimate. But it is still quite a big
number.

YouTube channels that run thematic streams usually have names associated with the key
speaker of a specific stream. For example, if a stream features Vitalik Buterin, most likely the
channel name would include Ethereum. In order to attract traffic, fraudsters use popular tags
and keywords related to crypto enthusiasts and cryptocurrencies.
All these channels have supposedly been either hacked or purchased on the underground
market. It is more than likely that they once belonged to individuals who used them on a
regular basis. This can be derived from the date that the channel was registered, from the
videos and playlists published on the channel that do not match the topic of the fraudulent
stream, and from the large number of views. Some channels contain nothing but the
fraudulent stream, however.
Most streams lasted more than three hours, but some were cut off abruptly. Sometimes the
channel owner shut them down, while in other cases the channels were closed down for
violating terms and conditions of use. Once a stream goes down, it usually becomes
inaccessible.

Hot and empty
In most cases, streams mainly discussed cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
Ripple, while Cardano, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu trailed behind with fewer mentions. QR
codes with links to crypto wallets were sometimes displayed over the stream.
Research into the fraudulent scheme revealed that addresses of crypto wallets mentioned on
fake websites were sometimes changed or updated. Several domain names often displayed
5/11

one and the same crypto wallet address. In total, Group-IB experts detected more than 30
crypto wallets used for the scheme, with a total remaining balance of $933,963. The most
popular cryptocurrency used by fraudsters as part of the scheme is Ethereum.
Within three days of monitoring, (from February 16 to 18, 2022) all detected crypto wallets,
controlled by the scammers, received 281 transactions in total, amounting to more than
$1,680,000.
When analyzing fraudulent websites promoted during the fake streams, Group-IB's
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB) detected an unusual technique.
Depending on the cryptocurrency and type of crypto wallets, scammers asked visitors to their
fake giveaway website to enter seed phrases to connect their wallets.

Scammers explained the request by a made-up promotion where participants who connected
their wallets would receive an additional bonus and increased payout.

Once a victim shares their seed phrase, fraudsters gain control over their wallet and
withdraw all funds from it. The exact number of victims and total amount of stolen funds
remains unknown, but clearly some victims could not resist taking the bait.

Scammers' infrastructure
While analyzing the streams that promoted the latest wave of fake giveaways promoted,
CERT-GIB experts initially retrieved the links to 29 websites with guidelines on how to double
the investments. As a rule, 3 to 4 streams run simultaneously, and they all lead viewers to
the same domain. The domain names contain keywords from streams and names of crypto
projects.
Regardless of the cryptocurrency used, all such websites were designed based on the same
pattern: scammer impersonate a well-known crypto enthusiast, project, or the entire crypto
industry, announce the giveaway conditions, and publish the following: short FAQs, the
address of a crypto wallet where participants are supposed to transfer their coins, and a
section with fake examples of successful giveaway transactions. Their goal is to make
visitors believe they can get rich.

Most of the time, fraudsters use one-page template-based websites with an eye-catching
design and high-quality crypto-themed images. The website design is the main factor that
helps fraudsters deceive visitors and make them transfer cryptocurrency to the designated
wallets.
A deeper analysis of the scammer's domain infrastructure revealed that those 29 websites
were part of a massive network of 583 interconnected resources all set up in the first quarter
of 2022. Notably, there were three times as many domains registered for this scheme in less
than three months of 2022 compared to the whole of last year.

Below is a snapshot of interconnected network nodes used as part of a single cryptocurrency
scam campaign. It shows that separate web resources are connected based on various
network indicators.
Despite that giveaway schemes have existed for a long time and are based on
straightforward deception techniques, they remain effective. The fact that they work could be
rooted in an influx of inexperienced cryptocurrency users who have not encountered this kind
of fraud yet, which are the kind of potential victims that fraudsters target the most.

And you can also buy NFTs…
Research into a fraud scheme involving cryptocurrency streams revealed another YouTuberelated scheme targeting NFT (Non-Fungible Token) investors.

9/11

The NFT scheme is based on the same pattern. Scammers use original footage with crypto
gurus, such as Gary Vaynerchuk aka Gary V, who discuss purchasing NTF images whose
price could increase 10-fold over time. The stream description contains a link to a scam
website where visitors are promised one NFT in exchange for sharing the data of their crypto
wallet (password and key, required to restore access to the account).

Recommendations
How to protect your cryptocurrency assets and not fall victim to crypto scammers.
Verify all information using official sources only
For example, go to the crypto project's official website. If you cannot find any information
about the promotion taking place, you are likely being deceived regardless of the actions that
you are being asked to take.
Do not share your seed phrase with third parties

10/11

Seed phrases must be kept secret and stored securely. To do so, use password
management tools. To minimize the risk of leakage, prioritize desktop solutions over cloudbased ones. Remember: the person who owns the seed phrase owns the wallet.
Keep up with the latest news on relevant topics
Learn from other people's experiences. Often, someone else will have already encountered a
similar situation. Be especially vigilant about free giveaways. Do not share confidential data
on rogue websites. Become familiar with information security recommendations and follow
them.
