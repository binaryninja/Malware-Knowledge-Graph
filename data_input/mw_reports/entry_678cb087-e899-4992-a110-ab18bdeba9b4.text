Leaked Ammyy Admin Source Code Turned into Malware

2/11

March 07, 2018 Proofpoint Staff
Overview
Proofpoint researchers have discovered a previously undocumented remote access Trojan (RAT) called
FlawedAmmyy that has been used since the beginning of 2016 in both highly targeted email attacks as well as
massive, multi-million message campaigns. Narrow attacks targeted the Automotive industry among others,
while the large malicious spam campaigns appear to be associated with threat actor TA505, an actor
responsible for many large-scale attacks since at least 2014.
Delivery Analysis
March 5, 2018
FlawedAmmyy Admin appeared most recently as the payload in massive email campaigns on March 5 and 6,
2018. The messages in these campaigns contained zipped .url attachments and both the messages and the
delivery suggest they were sent by threat actor TA505, known for sending large-scale Dridex, Locky, and
GlobeImposter campaigns, among others, over the last four years.
For example, on March 5, the messages were sent from addresses spoofing the recipient’s own domain with
subjects such as “Receipt No 1234567” (random digits, and first word could also be “Bill” or “Invoice”) and
matching attachments "Receipt 1234567.zip". The attachments were ZIP archives containing ".url" files with
names such as "B123456789012.url". Again, these were apparently random digits (Figure 1).

Figure 2: Contents of the .url file
The .url files are interpreted by Microsoft Windows as “Internet Shortcut” files [1], examples of which can be
found in the “Favorites” folder on Windows operating systems. This type of file can be created manually [2];
they are intended to serve as links to internet sites, launching the default browser automatically. However, in
this case the attacker specified the URL to be a “file://” network share instead of the typical http:// link. As a
result, the system downloads and executes a JavaScript file over the SMB protocol rather than launching a
web browser if the user clicks “Open” on the warning dialog shown in Figure 3.

This JavaScript in turn downloads Quant Loader, which, in this case, fetched the FlawedAmmyy RAT as the
final payload. The use of “.url” files and SMB protocol downloads is unusual, and this is the first time we have
seen these methods combined.
March 1, 2018
The FlawedAmmyy RAT previously appeared on March 1 in a narrowly targeted attack. Emails contained an
attachment 0103_022.doc (Figure 4), which used macros to download the FlawedAmmyy malware directly.
This sample used the same command and control (C&C) address as the sample from the massive campaign
on March 5.

We also observed this RAT in a narrowly targeted attack that included the automotive industry. Emails
contained the attachment 16.01.2018.doc which used macros to download the FlawedAmmyy RAT directly.
Malware Analysis
FlawedAmmyy is based on leaked source code for Version 3 of the Ammyy Admin remote desktop software.
As such FlawedAmmyy contains the functionality of the leaked version, including:
Remote Desktop control
File system manager
Proxy support
Audio Chat

Figure 6: Snippet of Ammyy Admin Version 3 source code, file TrMain.cpp
The FlawedAmmyy C&C protocol occurs over port 443 with HTTP. In the initial handshake, sent by the client to
the server, the first byte is always “=”, followed by 35 obfuscated and SEAL-encrypted bytes. After a server
response (0x2d00), the infected client sends the second packet. This packet has a 5-byte header that includes
the length of the rest of the packet (0x78). The body of this packet contains cleartext key-value pairs:

Conclusion
Ammyy Admin is a popular remote access tool used by businesses and consumers to handle remote control
and diagnostics on Microsoft Windows machines. However, leaked source code for Version 3 of Ammyy Admin
has emerged as a Remote Access Trojan called FlawedAmmyy appearing in a variety of malicious campaigns.
For infected individuals, this means that attackers potentially have complete access to their PCs, giving threat
actors the ability to access a variety of services, steal files and credentials, and much more. We have seen
FlawedAmmyy in both massive campaigns, potentially creating a large base of compromised computers, as
well as targeted campaigns that create opportunities for actors to steal customer data, proprietary information,
and more.
