Overview
Moobot is a Mirai based botnet. We first discovered its activity in July 2019. Here is our log
about it[0]. And ever since then, its sample updates, DDoS attacks and other activities have
never stopped.Recently we saw it participated in some very high profile DDoS attacks, we
got asked quite a few times in the security community regarding to what botnet is behind the
attacks, so here is some more details.

Sample dissemination
Moobot samples are mainly spread through weak telnet passwords and some nday and 0day
[1][2]vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities we observed using Moobot are as follows:

Sample analysis
In the previous article, we introduced many variants of Moobot. We believe that its author is
more inclined to develop and use new methods than to simply change C2. The authors of
Moobot had made many attempts at the sample binary level & network traffic level.
Generally, samples used multiple combinations of the following methods to make job difficult
for security researchers.
Use DNS TXT to carry C2/ manually construct DNS TXT request
Packing with the new UPX magic number
Hidden sensitive resources using encryption method of code table replacement
Use SOCKS PROXY, TOR PROXY
Since Jan 2020, another variant we called Moobot_xor became active. Moobot_xor doesn't
adopt mothods metioned above,but just only modified the register message?). Maybe the
author of Moobot has found that only one such simple modification and the constant
replacement of C2 is needed to achieve very good benefits during the operation for up to 1
year, there is no need to invest in new technology research.

Sample information
MD5:98c8326b28163fdaeeb0b056f940ed72
ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
Packer:None
Lib:uclibc
Verdict: Moobot_xor

Moobot_xor is very close to Mirai, so we are not going to cover things folks already knew. We
will only introduce Moobot_xor’s encryption method and the communication protocol,
understanding the encryption method will help extract the bot's configuration information,
knowing the communication protocol should facility tracking C2 to obtain the attack
instructions, we hope that these contents can help the community to better fight the Moobot
family.

Encryption method

2/8

Moobot_xor uses Mirai's classic Xor encryption and decryption method, the key is
0DEADBEEFh ,

Communication protocol
Moobot_xor has made some minor modifications on the basis of the Mirai communication
protocol. Let’s look at a few of them here.

Moobot DDoS activity
Since we started tracking Moobot, its attack activity has never stopped. There are only a
handful of C2s, but attack targets are all over the world, with about 100 targets per day.

Moobot's target

The trend of Moobot's daily attack targets is shown in the figure below:：

It can be seen from the above figure that Moobot's DDoS attack activity has obvious
anomalies from the end of March 2020 to the beginning of May 2020, and the daily attack
target of Moobot has increased from a few hundred to nearly 20,000. When we took a close
look, we found that Moobot's attack target surged because Moobot attacked about 48k of
Brazilian IP during this period. We don’t know what was reason behind that. After taking

Brazil our from the attack targets. Moobot's daily live attack targets are as follows, about 100
attack targets per day:

Moobot attacks the affected domain name
We were able to confirm that Moobot has been behind some very high profile DDos
attacks.We cannot disclose more detail here, but we had a tag cloud in our prior blog here[3].
