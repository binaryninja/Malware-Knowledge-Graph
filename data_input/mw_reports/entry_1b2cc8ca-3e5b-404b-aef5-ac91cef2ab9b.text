AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea’s Cryptocurrency
Malware
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a

Summary
This Advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
(ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics
and techniques.
This joint advisory is the result of analytic efforts among the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of
Treasury (Treasury) to highlight the cyber threat to cryptocurrency posed by North Korea,
formally known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and provide
mitigation recommendations. Working with U.S. government partners, FBI, CISA, and
Treasury assess that Lazarus Group—which these agencies attribute to North Korean statesponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors—is targeting individuals and companies,
including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial service companies, through the
dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that have been modified to include
malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency.
These cyber actors have targeted organizations for cryptocurrency theft in over 30 countries
during the past year alone. It is likely that these actors view modified cryptocurrency trading
applications as a means to circumvent international sanctions on North Korea—the
applications enable them to gain entry into companies that conduct cryptocurrency
transactions and steal cryptocurrency from victim accounts. As highlighted in FASTCash 2.0:
North Korea's BeagleBoyz Robbing Banks and Guidance on the North Korean Cyber Threat,
North Korea’s state-sponsored cyber actors are targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and
accounts to steal and launder hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency.[1][2][3] The
U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as
HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.uscert.cisa.gov/northkorea.
The U.S. Government has identified malware and indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by
the North Korean government to facilitate cryptocurrency thefts; the cybersecurity community
refers to this activity as “AppleJeus.” This report catalogues AppleJeus malware in detail.
North Korea has used AppleJeus malware posing as cryptocurrency trading platforms since
at least 2018. In most instances, the malicious application—seen on both Windows and Mac
operating systems—appears to be from a legitimate cryptocurrency trading company, thus
fooling individuals into downloading it as a third-party application from a website that seems

1/27

legitimate. In addition to infecting victims through legitimate-looking websites, HIDDEN
COBRA actors also use phishing, social networking, and social engineering techniques to
lure users into downloading the malware.
Refer to the following Malware Analysis Reports (MARs) for full technical details of
AppleJeus malware and associated IOCs.
Click here for a PDF version of this report.

Technical Details
The North Korean government has used multiple versions of AppleJeus since the malware
was initially discovered in 2018. This section outlines seven of the versions below. The
MARs listed above provide further technical details of these versions. Initially, HIDDEN
COBRA actors used websites that appeared to host legitimate cryptocurrency trading
platforms to infect victims with AppleJeus; however, these actors are now also using other
initial infection vectors, such as phishing, social networking, and social engineering
techniques, to get users to download the malware.

Targeted Nations
HIDDEN COBRA actors have targeted institutions with AppleJeus malware in several
sectors, including energy, finance, government, industry, technology, and
telecommunications. Since January 2020, the threat actors have targeted these sectors in
the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark,
Estonia, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg,
Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia,
South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and the United States
(figure 1).

AppleJeus Versions Note
The version numbers used for headings in this document correspond to the order the
AppleJeus campaigns were identified in open source or through other investigative means.
These versions may or may not be in the correct order to develop or deploy the AppleJeus
campaigns.

AppleJeus Version 1: Celas Trade Pro
Introduction and Infrastructure
In August 2018, open-source reporting disclosed information about a trojanized version of a
legitimate cryptocurrency trading application on an undisclosed victim’s computer. The
malicious program, known as Celas Trade Pro, was a modified version of the benign Q.T.
Bitcoin Trader application. This incident led to the victim company being infected with a
Remote Administration Tool (RAT) known as FALLCHILL, which was attributed to North
Korea (HIDDEN COBRA) by the U.S. Government. FALLCHILL is a fully functional RAT with
multiple commands that the adversary can issue from a command and control (C2) server to
infected systems via various proxies. FALLCHILL typically infects a system as a file dropped
by other HIDDEN COBRA malware (Develop Capabilities: Malware [T1587.001]). Because
of this, additional HIDDEN COBRA malware may be present on systems compromised with
FALLCHILL.[4]

3/27

Further research revealed that a phishing email from a Celas LLC company (Phishing:
Spearphishing Link [T1566.002]) recommended the trojanized cryptocurrency trading
application to victims. The email provided a link to the Celas’ website, celasllc[.]com
(Acquire Infrastructure: Domain [T1583.001]), where the victim could download a Windows
or macOS version of the trojanized application.
The celasllc[.]com domain resolved to the following Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
from May 29, 2018, to January 23, 2021.
45.199.63[.]220
107.187.66[.]103
145.249.106[.]19
175.29.32[.]160
185.142.236[.]213
185.181.104[.]82
198.251.83[.]27
208.91.197[.]46
209.99.64[.]18

The celasllc[.]com domain had a valid Sectigo (previously known as Comodo) Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate (Obtain Capabilities: Digital Certificates [T1588.004]). The
SSL certificate was “Domain Control Validated,” a weak security verification level that does
not require validation of the owner’s identity or the actual business’s existence.
Celas Trade Pro Application Analysis
Windows Program
The Windows version of the malicious Celas Trade Pro application is an MSI Installer
( .msi ). The MSI Installer installation package comprises a software component and an
application programming interface (API) that Microsoft uses for the installation, maintenance,
and removal of software. The installer looks legitimate and is signed by a valid Sectigo
certificate that was purchased by the same user as the SSL certificate for celasllc[.]com
(Obtain Capabilities: Code Signing Certificates [T1588.003]). The MSI Installer asks the
victim for administrative privileges to run (User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002]).
Once permission is granted, the threat actor is able to run the program with elevated
privileges (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism [T1548]) and MSI executes the following
actions.
Installs CelasTradePro.exe in folder C:\Program Files (x86)\CelasTradePro
Installs Updater.exe in folder C:\Program Files (x86)\CelasTradePro
Runs Updater.exe with the CheckUpdate parameters

4/27

The CelasTradePro.exe program asks for the user’s exchange and loads a legitimatelooking cryptocurrency trading platform—very similar to the benign Q.T. Bitcoin Trader—that
exhibits no signs of malicious activity.
The Updater.exe program has the same program icon as CelasTradePro.exe . When
run, it checks for the CheckUpdate parameter, collects the victim’s host information
(System Owner/User Discovery [T1033]), encrypts the collected information with a
hardcoded XOR encryption, and sends information to a C2 website (Exfiltration Over C2
Channel [T1041]).
macOS X Program
The macOS version of the malicious application is a DMG Installer that has a disk image
format that Apple commonly uses to distribute software over the internet. The installer looks
legitimate and has a valid digital signature from Sectigo (Obtain Capabilities: Digital
Certificates [T1588.004]). It has very similar functionality to the Windows version. The
installer executes the following actions.
Installs CelasTradePro in folder
/Applications/CelasTradePro.app/Contents/MacOS/

Installs Updater in folder /Applications/CelasTradePro.app/Contents/MacOS
Executes a postinstall script
Moves .com.celastradepro.plist to folder LaunchDaemons
Runs Updater with the CheckUpdate parameter
CelasTradePro asks for the user’s exchange and loads a legitimate-looking

cryptocurrency trading platform—very similar to the benign Q.T. Bitcoin Trader—that exhibits
no signs of malicious activity.
Updater checks for the CheckUpdate parameter and, when found, it collects the victim’s

host information (System Owner/User Discovery [T1033]), encrypts the collected information
with a hardcoded XOR key before exfiltration, and sends the encrypted information to a C2
website (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel [T1041]). This process helps the adversary obtain
persistence on a victim’s network.
The postinstall script is a sequence of instructions that runs after successfully installing
an application (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell [T1059.004]). This script
moves property list ( plist ) file .com.celastradepro.plist from the installer package
to the LaunchDaemons folder (Scheduled Task/Job: Launchd [T1053.004]). The leading “.”
makes it unlisted in the Finder app or default Terminal directory listing (Hide Artifacts: Hidden
Files and Directories [T1564.001]). Once in the folder, this property list ( plist ) file will
launch the Updater program with the CheckUpdate parameter on system load as Root
for every user. Because the LaunchDaemon will not run automatically after the plist file

5/27

is moved, the postinstall script launches the Updater program with the
CheckUpdate parameter and runs it in the background (Create or Modify System Process:
Launch Daemon [T1543.004]).
Payload
After a cybersecurity company published a report detailing the above programs and their
malicious extras, the website was no longer accessible. Since this site was the C2 server,
the payload cannot be confirmed. The cybersecurity company that published the report
states the payload was an encrypted and obfuscated binary (Obfuscated Files or Information
[T1027]), which eventually drops FALLCHILL onto the machine and installs it as a service
(Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service [T1543.003]). FALLCHILL malware
uses an RC4 encryption algorithm with a 16-byte key to protect its communications
(Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography [T1573.001]). The key employed in these
versions has also been used in a previous version of FALLCHILL.[5][6]
For more details on AppleJeus Version 1: Celas Trade Pro, see MAR-10322463-1.v1.

AppleJeus Version 2: JMT Trading
Introduction and Infrastructure
In October 2019, a cybersecurity company identified a new version of the AppleJeus
malware—JMT Trading—thanks to its many similarities to the original AppleJeus malware.
Again, the malware was in the form of a cryptocurrency trading application, which a
legitimate-looking company, called JMT Trading, marketed and distributed on their website,
jmttrading[.]org (Acquire Infrastructure: Domain [T1583.001]). This website contained a
“Download from GitHub” button, which linked to JMT Trading’s GitHub page (Acquire
Infrastructure: Web Services [T1583.006]), where Windows and macOS X versions of the
JMT Trader application were available for download (Develop Capabilities: Malware
[T1587.001]). The GitHub page also included .zip and tar.gz files containing the source code.
The jmttrading[.]org domain resolved to the following IP addresses from October 15,
2016, to January 22, 2021.
45.33.2[.]79
45.33.23[.]183
45.56.79[.]23
45.79.19[.]196
96.126.123[.]244
146.112.61[.]107
184.168.221[.]40
184.168.221[.]57
198.187.29[.]20

6/27

198.54.117[.]197
198.54.117[.]198
198.54.117[.]199
198.54.117[.]200
198.58.118[.]167

The jmttrading[.]org domain had a valid Sectigo SSL certificate (Obtain Capabilities:
Digital Certificates [T1588.004]). The SSL certificate was “Domain Control Validated,” a weak
security verification level that does not require validation of the owner’s identity or the actual
business’s existence. The current SSL certificate was issued by Let’s Encrypt.
JMT Trading Application Analysis
Windows Program
The Windows version of the malicious cryptocurrency application is an MSI Installer. The
installer looks legitimate and has a valid digital signature from Sectigo (Obtain Capabilities:
Digital Certificates [T1588.004]). The signature was signed with a code signing certificate
purchased by the same user as the SSL certificate for jmttrading[.]org (Obtain
Capabilities: Code Signing Certificates [T1588.003]). The MSI Installer asks the victim for
administrative privileges to run (User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002]).
Once permission is granted, the MSI executes the following actions.
Installs JMTTrader.exe in folder C:\Program Files (x86)\JMTTrader
Installs CrashReporter.exe in folder C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\JMTTrader

Runs CrashReporter.exe with the Maintain parameter
The JMTTrader.exe program asks for the user’s exchange and loads a legitimate-looking
cryptocurrency trading platform—very similar to CelasTradePro.exe and the benign Q.T.
Bitcoin Trader—that exhibits no signs of malicious activity.
The program CrashReporter.exe is heavily obfuscated with the ADVObfuscation library,
renamed “snowman” (Obfuscated Files or Information [T1027]). When run, it checks for the
Maintain parameter and collects the victim’s host information (System Owner/User
Discovery [T1033]), encrypts the collected information with a hardcoded XOR key before
exfiltration, and sends the encrypted information to a C2 website (Exfiltration Over C2
Channel [T1041]). The program also creates a scheduled SYSTEM task, named
JMTCrashReporter , which runs CrashReporter.exe with the Maintain parameter at
any user’s login (Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task [T1053.005]).
macOS X Program

7/27

The macOS version of the malicious application is a DMG Installer. The installer looks
legitimate and has very similar functionality to the Windows version, but it does not have a
digital certificate and will warn the user of that before installation. The installer executes the
following actions.
Installs JMTTrader in folder /Applications/JMTTrader.app/Contents/MacOS/
Installs .CrashReporter in folder
/Applications/JMTTrader.app/Contents/Resources/

Note: the leading “.” makes it unlisted in the Finder app or default Terminal
directory listing.
Executes a postinstall script
Moves .com.jmttrading.plist to folder LaunchDaemons
Changes the file permissions on the plist
Runs CrashReporter with the Maintain parameter
Moves .CrashReporter to folder /Library/JMTTrader/CrashReporter
Makes .CrashReporter executable
The JMTTrader program asks for the user’s exchange and loads a legitimate-looking
cryptocurrency trading platform—very similar to CelasTradePro and the benign Q.T.
Bitcoin Trader—that exhibits no signs of malicious activity.
The CrashReporter program checks for the Maintain parameter and is not obfuscated.
This lack of obfuscation makes it easier to determine the program’s functionality in detail.
When it finds the Maintain parameter, it collects the victim’s host information (System
Owner/User Discovery [T1033]), encrypts the collected information with a hardcoded XOR
key before exfiltration, and sends the encrypted information to a C2 website (Exfiltration Over
C2 Channel [T1041]).
The postinstall script has similar functionality to the one used by CelasTradePro , but
it has a few additional features (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell [T1059.004]).
It moves the property list ( plist ) file .com.jmttrading.plis t from the Installer package
to the LaunchDaemons folder (Scheduled Task/Job: Launchd [T1053.004]), but also
changes the file permissions on the plist file. Once in the folder, this property list
( plist ) file will launch the CrashReporter program with the Maintain parameter on
system load as Root for every user. Also, the postinstall script moves the
.CrashReporter program to a new location /Library/JMTTrader/CrashReporter and
makes it executable. Because the LaunchDaemon will not run automatically after the
plist file is moved, the postinstall script launches CrashReporter with the
Maintain parameter and runs it in the background (Create or Modify System Process:
Launch Daemon [T1543.004]).
Payload

8/27

Soon after the cybersecurity company tweeted about JMT Trader on October 11, 2019, the
files on GitHub were updated to clean, non-malicious installers. Then on October 13, 2019, a
different cybersecurity company published an article detailing the macOS X JMT Trader, and
soon after, the C2 beastgoc[.]com website went offline. There is not a confirmed sample
of the payload to analyze at this point.
For more details on AppleJeus Version 2: JMT Trading, see MAR-10322463-2.v1.

AppleJeus Version 3: Union Crypto
Introduction and Infrastructure
In December 2019, another version of the AppleJeus malware was identified on Twitter by a
cybersecurity company based on many similarities to the original AppleJeus malware. Again,
the malware was in the form of a cryptocurrency trading application, which was marketed
and distributed by a legitimate-looking company, called Union Crypto, on their website,
unioncrypto[.]vip (Acquire Infrastructure: Domain [T1583.001]). Although this website is
no longer available, a cybersecurity researcher discovered a download link,
https://www.unioncrypto[.]vip/download/W6c2dq8By7luMhCmya2v97YeN , recorded
on VirusTotal for the macOS X version of UnionCryptoTrader . In contrast, open-source
reporting stated that the Windows version might have been downloaded via instant
messaging service Telegram, as it was found in a “Telegram Downloads” folder on an
unnamed victim.[7]
The unioncrypto[.]vip domain resolved to the following IP addresses from June 5,
2019, to July 15, 2020.
104.168.167[.]16
198.54.117[.]197
198.54.117[.]198
198.54.117[.]199
198.54.117[.]200

The domain unioncrypto[.]vip had a valid Sectigo SSL certificate (Obtain Capabilities:
Digital Certificates [T1588.004]). The SSL certificate was “Domain Control Validated,” a weak
security verification level that does not require validation of the owner’s identity or the actual
business’s existence.
Union Crypto Trader Application Analysis
Windows Program
The Windows version of the malicious cryptocurrency application is a Windows executable
( .exe ) (User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002]), which acts as an installer that extracts
a temporary MSI Installer.
9/27

The Windows program executes the following actions.
Extracts UnionCryptoTrader.msi to folder C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\{82E4B719-90F74BD1-9CF1-56CD777E0C42}

Runs UnionCryptoUpdater.msi
Installs UnionCryptoTrader.exe in folder C:\Program
Files\UnionCryptoTrader

Installs UnionCryptoUpdater.exe in folder C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Local\UnionCryptoTrader

Deletes UnionCryptoUpdater.msi
Runs UnionCryptoUpdater.exe
The program UnionCryptoTrader.exe loads a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency arbitrage
application—defined as “the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or
commodities in different markets or in derivative forms to take advantage of differing prices
for the same asset”—which exhibits no signs of malicious activity. This application is very
similar to another cryptocurrency arbitrage application known as Blackbird Bitcoin Arbitrage.
[8]
The program UnionCryptoUpdater.exe first installs itself as a service (Create or Modify
System Process: Windows Service [T1543.003]), which will automatically start when any
user logs on (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution [T1547]). The service is installed with a
description stating it “Automatically installs updates for Union Crypto Trader.” When
launched, it collects the victim’s host information (System Owner/User Discovery [T1033]),
combines the information in a string that is MD5 hashed and stored in the auth_signature
variable before exfiltration, and sends it to a C2 website (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
[T1041]).
macOS X Program
The macOS version of the malicious application is a DMG Installer. The installer looks
legitimate and has very similar functionality to the Windows version, but it does not have a
digital certificate and will warn the user of that before installation. The installer executes the
following actions.
Installs UnionCryptoTrader in folder
/Applications/UnionCryptoTrader.app/Contents/MacOS/

Installs .unioncryptoupdater in folder
/Applications/UnionCryptoTrader.app/Contents/Resources/

Note: the leading “.” makes it unlisted in the Finder app or default Terminal
directory listing

10/27

Executes a postinstall script
Moves .vip.unioncrypto.plist to folder LaunchDaemons
Changes the file permissions on the plist to Root
Runs unioncryptoupdater
Moves .unioncryptoupdater to folder
/Library/UnionCrypto/unioncryptoupdater

Makes .unioncryptoupdater executable
The UnionCryptoTrader program loads a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency arbitrage
application, which exhibits no signs of malicious activity. The application is very similar to
another cryptocurrency arbitrage application known as Blackbird Bitcoin Arbitrage.
The .unioncryptoupdater program is signed ad-hoc, meaning it is not signed with a valid
code-signing identity. When launched, it collects the victim’s host information (System
Owner/User Discovery [T1033]), combines the information in a string that is MD5 hashed
and stored in the auth_signature variable before exfiltration, and sends it to a C2 website
(Exfiltration Over C2 Channel [T1041]).
The postinstall script has similar functionality to the one used by JMT Trading
(Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell [T1059.004]). It moves the property list
( plist ) file .vip.unioncrypto.plist from the Installer package to the
LaunchDaemons folder (Scheduled Task/Job: Launchd [T1053.004]), but also changes the
file permissions on the plist file to Root. Once in the folder, this property list ( plist ) file
will launch the .unioncryptoupdater on system load as Root for every user. The
postinstall script moves the .unioncryptoupdater program to a new location
/Library/UnionCrypto/unioncryptoupdater and makes it executable. Because the
LaunchDaemon will not run automatically after the plist file is moved, the postinstall
script launches .unioncryptoupdater and runs it in the background (Create or Modify
System Process: Launch Daemon [T1543.004]).
Payload
The payload for the Windows malware is a Windows Dynamic-LinkLibrary. UnionCryptoUpdater.exe does not immediately download the stage 2 malware
but instead downloads it after a time specified by the C2 server. This delay could be
implemented to prevent researchers from directly obtaining the stage 2 malware.
The macOS X malware’s payload could not be downloaded, as the C2 server is no longer
accessible. Additionally, none of the open-source reporting for this sample contained copies
of the macOS X payload. The macOS X payload is likely similar in functionality to the
Windows stage 2 detailed above.
For more details on AppleJeus Version 3: Union Crypto, see MAR-10322463-3.v1.

Commonalities between Celas Trade Pro, JMT Trading, and Union Crypto
11/27

Hardcoded Values
In each AppleJeus version, there are hardcoded values used for encryption or to create a
signature when combined with the time (table 1).
Table 1: AppleJeus hardcoded values and uses

Combined with time for signature

The Union Crypto Trader and Celas LLC (XOR) values are 16 bytes in length. For JMT
Trader, the first 16 bytes of the Windows and macOS X values are identical, and the
additional bytes are in a time format for the Windows sample. The structure of a 16-byte
value combined with the time is also used in Union Crypto Trader to create the
auth_signature .
As mentioned, FALLCHILL was reported as the final payload for Celas Trade Pro. All
FALLCHILL samples use 16-byte hardcoded RC4 keys for sending data, similar to the 16byte keys in the AppleJeus samples.
Open-Source Cryptocurrency Applications
All three AppleJeus samples are bundled with modified copies of legitimate cryptocurrency
applications and can be used as originally designed to trade cryptocurrency. Both Celas LLC
and JMT Trader modified the same cryptocurrency application, Q.T. Bitcoin Trader; Union
Crypto Trader modified the Blackbird Bitcoin Arbitrage application.
Postinstall Scripts, Property List Files, and LaunchDaemons
The macOS X samples of all three AppleJeus versions contain postinstall scripts with
similar logic. The Celas LLC postinstall script only moves the plist file to a new
location and launches Updater with the CheckUpdate parameter in the background. The
JMT Trader and Union Crypto Trader also perform these actions and have identical
functionality. The additional actions performed by both postinstall scripts are to change
the file permissions on the plist , make a new directory in the /Library folder, move
CrashReporter or UnionCryptoUpdater to the newly created folder, and make them
executable.
12/27

The plist files for all three AppleJeus files have identical functionality. They only differ in
the files’ names and one default comment that was not removed from the Celas LLC
plist . As the logic and functionality of the postinstall scripts and plist files are almost
identical, the LaunchDaemons created also function the same.
They will all launch the secondary executable as Root on system load for every user.

AppleJeus Version 4: Kupay Wallet
Introduction and Infrastructure
On March 13, 2020, a new version of the AppleJeus malware was identified. The malware
was marketed and distributed by a legitimate-looking company, called Kupay Wallet, on their
website kupaywallet[.]com (Acquire Infrastructure: Domain [T1583.001]).
The domain www.kupaywallet[.]com resolved to IP address 104.200.67[.]96 from
March 20, 2020, to January 16, 2021. CrownCloud US, LLC controlled the IP address
(autonomous system number [ASN] 8100), and is located in New York, NY.
The domain www.kupaywallet[.]com had a valid Sectigo SSL certificate (Obtain
Capabilities: Digital Certificates [T1588.004]). The SSL certificate was “Domain Control
Validated,” a weak security verification level that does not require validation of the owner’s
identity or the actual business’s existence.
Kupay Wallet Application Analysis
Windows Program
The Windows version of the malicious cryptocurrency application is an MSI Installer. The
MSI executes the following actions.
Installs Kupay.exe in folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Kupay
Installs KupayUpgrade.exe in folder C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\KupaySupport

Runs KupayUpgrade.exe
The program Kupay.exe loads a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency wallet platform, which
exhibits no signs of malicious activity and is very similar to an open-source platform known
as Copay, distributed by Atlanta-based company BitPay.
The program KupayUpgrade.exe first installs itself as a service (Create or Modify System
Process: Windows Service [T1543.003]), which will automatically start when any user logs
on (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution [T1547]). The service is installed with a description

13/27

stating it is an “Automatic Kupay Upgrade.” When launched, it collects the victim’s host
information (System Owner/User Discovery [T1033]), combines the information in strings
before exfiltration, and sends it to a C2 website (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel [T1041]).
macOS X Program
The macOS version of the malicious application is a DMG Installer. The installer looks
legitimate and has very similar functionality to the Windows version, but it does not have a
digital certificate and will warn the user of that before installation. The installer executes the
following actions.
Installs Kupay in folder /Applications/Kupay.app/Contents/MacOS/
Installs kupay_upgrade in folder /Applications/Kupay.app/Contents/MacOS/
Executes a postinstall script
Creates KupayDaemon folder in /Library/Application Support folder
Moves kupay_upgrade to the new folder
Moves com.kupay.pkg.wallet.plist to folder /Library/LaunchDaemons/
Runs the command launchctl load to load the plist without a restart
Runs kupay_upgrade in the background
Kupay is likely a copy of an open-source cryptocurrency wallet application, loads a

legitimate-looking wallet program (fully functional), and its functionality is identical to the
Windows Kupay.exe program.
The kupay_upgrade program calls its function CheckUpdate (which contains most of the
logic functionality of the malware) and sends a POST to the C2 server with a connection
named “Kupay Wallet 9.0.1 (Check Update Osx)” (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols
[T1071.001]). If the C2 server returns a file, it is decoded and written to the victim’s folder
/private/tmp/kupay_update with permissions set by the command chmod 700 (only
the user can read, write, and execute) (Command and Scripting Interpreter [T1059]). Stage 2
is then launched, and the malware, kupay_upgrade , returns to sleeping and checking in
with the C2 server at predetermined intervals (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols
[T1071.001]).
The postinstall script has similar functionality to other AppleJeus scripts (Command and
Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell [T1059.004]). It creates the KupayDaemon folder in
/Library/Application Support folder and then moves kupay_upgrade to the new
folder. It moves the property list ( plist ) file com.kupay.pkg.wallet.plist from the
Installer package to the /Library/LaunchDaemons/ folder (Scheduled Task/Job: Launchd
[T1053.004]). The script runs the command launchctl load to load the plist without a
restart (Command and Scripting Interpreter [T1059]). But, since the LaunchDaemon will not
run automatically after the plist file is moved, the postinstall script launches
kupay_upgrade and runs it in the background (Create or Modify System Process: Launch
Daemon [T1543.004]).
14/27

Payload
The Windows malware’s payload could not be downloaded since the C2 server is no longer
accessible. Additionally, none of the open-source reporting for this sample contained copies
of the payload. The Windows payload is likely similar in functionality to the macOS X stage 2
detailed below.
The stage 2 payload for the macOS X malware was decoded and analyzed. The stage 2
malware has a variety of functionalities. Most importantly, it checks in with a C2 and, after
connecting to the C2, can send or receive a payload, read and write files, execute
commands via the terminal, etc.

AppleJeus Version 5: CoinGoTrade
Introduction and Infrastructure
In early 2020, another version of the AppleJeus malware was identified. This time the
malware was marketed and distributed by a legitimate-looking company called CoinGoTrade
on their website coingotrade[.]com (Acquire Infrastructure: Domain [T1583.001]).
The domain CoinGoTrade[.]com resolved to IP address 198.54.114[.]175 from
February 28, 2020, to January 23, 2021. The IP address is controlled by NameCheap Inc.
(ASN 22612) and is located in Atlanta, GA. This IP address is in the same ASN for
Dorusio[.]com and Ants2Whale[.]com .
The domain CoinGoTrade[.]com had a valid Sectigo SSL certificate (Obtain Capabilities:
Digital Certificates [T1588.004]). The SSL certificate was “Domain Control Validated,” a weak
security verification level that does not require validation of the owner’s identity or the actual
business’s existence.
CoinGoTrade Application Analysis
Windows Program
The Windows version of the malicious application is an MSI Installer. The installer appears to
be legitimate and will execute the following actions.
Installs CoinGoTrade.exe in folder C:\Program Files (x86)\CoinGoTrade
Installs CoinGoTradeUpdate.exe in folder C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\CoinGoTradeSupport

Runs CoinGoTradeUpdate.exe
CoinGoTrade.exe loads a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency wallet platform with no signs

of malicious activity and is a copy of an open-source cryptocurrency application.
15/27

CoinGoTradeUpdate.exe first installs itself as a service (Create or Modify System Process:

Windows Service [T1543.003]), which will automatically start when any user logs on (Boot or
Logon Autostart Execution [T1547]). The service is installed with a description stating it is an
“Automatic CoinGoTrade Upgrade.” When launched, it collects the victim’s host information
(System Owner/User Discovery [T1033]), combines the information in strings before
exfiltration, and sends it to a C2 website (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel [T1041]).
macOS X Program
The macOS version of the malicious application is a DMG Installer. The installer looks
legitimate and has very similar functionality to the Windows version, but it does not have a
digital certificate and will warn the user of that before installation. The installer executes the
following actions.
Installs CoinGoTrade in folder
/Applications/CoinGoTrade.app/Contents/MacOS/

Installs CoinGoTradeUpgradeDaemon in folder
/Applications/CoinGoTrade.app/Contents/MacOS/

Executes a postinstall script
Creates CoinGoTradeService folder in /Library/Application Support
folder
Moves CoinGoTradeUpgradeDaemon to the new folder
Moves com.coingotrade.pkg.product.plist to folder
/Library/LaunchDaemons/

Runs CoinGoTradeUpgradeDaemon in the background
The CoinGoTrade program is likely a copy of an open-source cryptocurrency wallet
application and loads a legitimate-looking, fully functional wallet program).
The CoinGoTradeUpgradeDaemon program calls its function CheckUpdate (which
contains most of the logic functionality of the malware) and sends a POST to the C2 server
with a connection named “CoinGoTrade 1.0 (Check Update Osx)” (Application Layer
Protocol: Web Protocols [T1071.001]). If the C2 server returns a file, it is decoded and written
to the victim’s folder /private/tmp/updatecoingotrade with permissions set by the
command chmod 700 (only the user can read, write, and execute) (Command and
Scripting Interpreter [T1059]). Stage 2 is then launched, and the malware,
CoinGoTradeUpgradeDaemon , returns to sleeping and checking in with the C2 server at
predetermined intervals (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols [T1071.001]).
The postinstall script has similar functionality to the other scripts (Command and
Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell [T1059.004]) and installs CoinGoTrade and
CoinGoTradeUpgradeDaemon in folder
/Applications/CoinGoTrade.app/Contents/MacOS/ . It moves the property list (plist) file
com.coingotrade.pkg.product.plist to the /Library/LaunchDaemons/ folder
16/27

(Scheduled Task/Job: Launchd [T1053.004]). Because the LaunchDaemon will not run
automatically after the plist file is moved, the postinstall script launches
CoinGoTradeUpgradeDaemon and runs it in the background (Create or Modify System
Process: Launch Daemon [T1543.004]).
Payload
The Windows malware’s payload could not be downloaded because the C2 server is no
longer accessible. Additionally, none of the open-source reporting for this sample contained
copies of the payload. The Windows payload is likely similar in functionality to the macOS X
stage 2 detailed below.
The stage 2 payload for the macOS X malware was no longer available from the specified
download URL. Still, a file was submitted to VirusTotal by the same user on the same date as
the macOS X CoinGoTradeUpgradeDaemon . These clues suggest that the submitted file
may be related to the macOS X version of the malware and the downloaded payload.
The file prtspool is a 64-bit Mach-O executable with a large variety of features that have
all been confirmed as functionality. The file has three C2 URLs hardcoded into the file and
communicates to these with HTTP POST multipart-form data boundary string. Like other
HIDDEN COBRA malware, prtspool uses format strings to store data collected about the
system and sends it to the C2s.
For more details on AppleJeus Version 5: CoinGoTrade, see MAR-10322463-5.v1.

AppleJeus Version 6: Dorusio
Introduction and Infrastructure
In March 2020, an additional version of the AppleJeus malware was identified. This time the
malware was marketed and distributed by a legitimate-looking company called Dorusio on
their website, dorusio[.]com (Acquire Infrastructure: Domain [T1583.001]). Researchers
collected samples for Windows and macOS X versions of the Dorusio Wallet (Develop
Capabilities: Malware [T1587.001]). As of at least early 2020, the actual download links
result in 404 errors. The download page has release notes with version revisions claiming
to start with version 1.0.0, released on April 15, 2019.
The domain dorusio[.]com resolved to IP address 198.54.115[.]51 from March 30,
2020 to January 23, 2021. The IP address is controlled by NameCheap Inc. (ASN 22612)
and is located in Atlanta, GA. This IP address is in the same ASN for CoinGoTrade[.]com
and Ants2Whale[.]com.
The domain dorusio[.]com had a valid Sectigo SSL certificate (Obtain Capabilities: Digital
Certificates [T1588.004]). The SSL certificate was “Domain Control Validated,” a weak
security verification level that does not require validation of the owner’s identity or the actual
17/27

business’s existence.
Dorusio Application Analysis
Windows Program
The Windows version of the malicious application is an MSI Installer. The installer appears to
be legitimate and will install the following two programs.
Installs Dorusio.exe in folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Dorusio
Installs DorusioUpgrade.exe in folder C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\DorusioSupport

Runs DorusioUpgrade.exe
The program, Dorusio.exe , loads a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency wallet platform with
no signs of malicious activity and is a copy of an open-source cryptocurrency application.
The program DorusioUpgrade.exe first installs itself as a service (Create or Modify
System Process: Windows Service [T1543.003]), which will automatically start when any
user logs on (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution [T1547]). The service is installed with a
description stating it “Automatic Dorusio Upgrade.” When launched, it collects the victim’s
host information (System Owner/User Discovery [T1033]), combines the information in
strings before exfiltration, and sends it to a C2 website (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
[T1041]).
macOS X Program
The macOS version of the malicious application is a DMG Installer. The installer looks
legitimate and has very similar functionality to the Windows version, but it does not have a
digital certificate and will warn the user of that before installation. The installer executes the
following actions.
Installs Dorusio in folder /Applications/Dorusio.app/Contents/MacOS/
Installs Dorusio_upgrade in folder
/Applications/Dorusio.app/Contents/MacOS/

Executes a postinstall script
Creates DorusioDaemon folder in /Library/Application Support folder
Moves Dorusio_upgrade to the new folder
Moves com.dorusio.pkg.wallet.plist to folder
/Library/LaunchDaemons/

Runs Dorusio_upgrade in the background
The Dorusio program is likely a copy of an open-source cryptocurrency wallet application
and loads a legitimate-looking wallet program (fully functional). Aside from the Dorusio logo
and two new services, the wallet appears to be the same as the Kupay Wallet. This

18/27

application seems to be a modification of the open-source cryptocurrency wallet Copay
distributed by Atlanta-based company BitPay.
The Dorusio_upgrade program calls its function CheckUpdate (which contains most of
the logic functionality of the malware) and sends a POST to the C2 server with a connection
named “Dorusio Wallet 2.1.0 (Check Update Osx)” (Application Layer Protocol: Web
Protocols [T1071.001]). If the C2 server returns a file, it is decoded and written to the victim’s
folder /private/tmp/Dorusio_update with permissions set by the command chmod 700
(only the user can read, write, and execute) (Command and Scripting Interpreter [T1059]).
Stage 2 is then launched, and the malware, Dorusio_upgrade , returns to sleeping and
checking in with the C2 server at predetermined intervals (Application Layer Protocol: Web
Protocols [T1071.001]).
The postinstall script has similar functionality to other AppleJeus scripts (Command and
Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell [T1059.004]). It creates the DorusioDaemon folder in
/Library/Application Support folder and then moves Dorusio_upgrade to the new
folder. It moves the property list ( plist ) file com.dorusio.pkg.wallet.plist from the
Installer package to the /Library/LaunchDaemons/ folder (Scheduled Task/Job: Launchd
[T1053.004]). Because the LaunchDaemon will not run automatically after the plist file is
moved, the postinstall script launches Dorusio_upgrade and runs it in the
background (Create or Modify System Process: Launch Daemon [T1543.004]).
Payload
Neither the payload for the Windows nor macOS X malware could be downloaded; the C2
server is no longer accessible. The payloads are likely similar in functionality to the macOS X
stage 2 from CoinGoTrade and Kupay Wallet, or the Windows stage 2 from Union Crypto.
For more details on AppleJeus Version 6: Dorusio, see MAR-10322463-6.v1.

AppleJeus 4, 5, and 6 Installation Conflictions
If a user attempts to install the Kupay Wallet, CoinGoTrade, and Dorusio applications on the
same system, they will encounter installation conflicts.
If Kupay Wallet is already installed on a system and the user tries to install CoinGoTrade or
Dorusio:
Pop-up windows appear, stating a more recent version of the program is already
installed.
If CoinGoTrade is already installed on a system and the user attempts to install Kupay
Wallet:

19/27

Kupay.exe will be installed in the C:\Program Files (x86)\CoinGoTrade\
folder .

All CoinGoTrade files will be deleted.
The folders and files contained in the C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\CoinGoTradeSupport will remain installed.
KupayUpgrade.exe is installed in the new folder C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\KupaySupport .

If Dorusio is already installed on a system and the user attempts to install Kupay Wallet:
Kupay.exe will be installed in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Dorusio\ folder .

All Dorusio.exe files will be deleted.
The folders and files contained in C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\DorusioSupport will remain installed.
KupayUpgrade.exe is installed in the new folder C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\KupaySupport .

AppleJeus Version 7: Ants2Whale
Introduction and Infrastructure
In late 2020, a new version of AppleJeus was identified called “Ants2Whale.” The site for this
version of AppleJeus is ants2whale[.]com (Acquire Infrastructure: Domain [T1583.001]).
The website shows a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency company and application. The
website contains multiple spelling and grammar mistakes indicating the creator may not have
English as a first language. The website states that to download Ants2Whale, a user must
contact the administrator, as their product is a “premium package” (Develop Capabilities:
Malware [T1587.001]).
The domain ants2whale[.]com resolved to IP address 198.54.114[.]237 from
September 23, 2020, to January 22, 2021. The IP address is controlled by NameCheap, Inc.
(ASN 22612) and is located in Atlanta, GA. This IP address is in the same ASN for
CoinGoTrade[.]com and Dorusio[.]com .
The domain ants2whale[.]com had a valid Sectigo SSL certificate (Obtain Capabilities:
Digital Certificates [T1588.004]). The SSL certificate was “Domain Control Validated,” a weak
security verification level that does not require validation of the owner’s identity or the actual
business’s existence.
Ants2Whale Application Analysis
Windows Program
As of late 2020, the Windows program was not available on VirusTotal. It is likely very similar
to the macOS X version detailed below.
20/27

macOS X Program
The macOS version of the malicious application is a DMG Installer. The installer looks
legitimate and has very similar functionality to the Windows version, but it does not have a
digital certificate and will warn the user of that before installation. The installer executes the
following actions.
Installs Ants2Whale in folder
/Applications/Ants2whale.app/Contents/MacOS/Ants2whale

Installs Ants2WhaleHelper in folder /Library/Application
Support/Ants2WhaleSupport/

Executes a postinstall script
Moves com.Ants2whale.pkg.wallet.plist to folder
/Library/LaunchDaemons/

Runs Ants2WhaleHelper in the background
The Ants2Whale and Ants2WhaleHelper programs and the postinstall script
function almost identically to previous versions of AppleJeus and will not be discussed in
depth in this advisory.
For more details on AppleJeus Version 7: Ants2Whale, see MAR-10322463-7.v1.

Mitigations
Compromise Mitigations
Organizations that identify AppleJeus malware within their networks should take immediate
action. Initial actions should include the following steps.
Contact the FBI, CISA, or Treasury immediately regarding any identified activity related
to AppleJeus. (Refer to the Contact Information section below.)
Initiate your organization’s incident response plan.
Generate new keys for wallets, and/or move to new wallets.
Introduce a two-factor authentication solution as an extra layer of verification.
Use hardware wallets, which keep the private keys in a separate, secured storage
area.
To move funds out off a compromised wallet:
Do not use the malware listed in this advisory to transfer funds, and
Form all transactions offline and then broadcast them to the network all at once in
a short online session, ideally prior to the attacker accessing them.
Remove impacted hosts from network.
Assume the threat actors have moved laterally within the network and downloaded
additional malware.
Change all passwords to any accounts associated with impacted hosts.
Reimage impacted host(s).
Install anti-virus software to run daily deep scans of the host.
Ensure your anti-virus software is setup to download the latest signatures daily.
Install a Host Based Intrusion Detection (HIDS)-based software and keep it up to date.
Ensure all software and hardware is up to date, and all patches have been installed.
Ensure network-based firewall is installed and/or up to date.
Ensure the firewall’s firmware is up to date.
