[https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/state-board-election-rabbithole/] ".

On August 15, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) alerted
stakeholders [https://m.paralympic.org/news/wada-warns-stakeholdersphishing-scams] to phishing emails that used domains spoo ng the
WADA’s legitimate domain, wada-ama.org. WADA con rmed
[https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-08/wada-con rmsillegal-activity-on-yuliya-stepanovas-adams-account] that some users
had received illegitimate credential harvesting e-mails that look as
though they came from the WADA. The domains in the alert included:
wada-awa[.]org
wada-arna[.]org
ThreatConnect’s Research team reviewed these domains and found that
the sites were recently registered and their registration and hosting
information are consistent with Russian FANCY BEAR tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs), as shown in the diamond model below. Further,
we also identi ed another domain registered by the same individuals -tas-cass[.]org -- that spoofs the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s (CAS)
legitimate tas-cas.org domain.

WADA’s alert follows news from mid-August that WADA accounts and
servers had been compromised. On August 11, a group identifying
themselves as Anonymous Poland (@anpoland) defaced the CAS
website [http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/world-anti-doping-agencyhackers/] and leaked data stolen from WADA and CAS servers
[https://www.hackread.com/world-anti-doping-agency-site-hacked/] .
On August 13, the WADA [https://www.wadaama.org/en/media/news/2016-08/wada-con rms-illegal-activity-onyuliya-stepanovas-adams-account] and email
[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/russianwhistleblower-yuliya-stepanova-hacked-wada] accounts belonging to
Yuliya Stepanova, the Russian athlete who was called “Judas
[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/sports/olympics/yuliyastepanova-rio-olympics.html] ” by Vladimir Putin for helping to blow the
whistle on the state sponsored doping scandal, were hacked.
We assess that the phishing and Stepanova’s compromise most likely
are part of targeted activity by Russian actors in response to the

whistleblower and the WADA’s recommendation to ban all Russian
athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic games in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. Successful operations against these individuals and organizations
could facilitate Russian e orts to privately or publically intimidate them
or other potential whistleblowers. At this time, we are skeptical of
@anpoland’s origins but cannot determine the extent to which, if any,
they are a Russian platform similar to Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks.

ThreatConnect made a concerted e ort to alert WADA and CAS to these
ndings and have shared indicators from this activity in ThreatConnect’s
Incident 20160818A: Activity Targeting the WADA and CAS
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?
incident=1412887] .

WADA and CAS Background
An international independent agency, the WADA [https://www.wadaama.org/en] is not only composed of, but funded by governments and
the sport movement worldwide. One of the organization’s primary
responsibilities is to monitor the World Anti-Doping Code
[https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/the-code] .
The CAS [http://www.tas-cas.org/en/index.html] is a the highest
international tribunal that was established to settle disputes related to
sport through arbitration. Starting in 2016, an anti-doping division of
CAS began judging doping cases at the Olympic Games, replacing the
IOC disciplinary commission.

McLaren Report and Russian Athletes
Banned
In 2014, Stepanova, a Russian track athlete, and her husband, a former
employee of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, appeared in a
documentary
[https://presse.wdr.de/plounge/tv/das_erste/2014/12/_pdf/EnglishSkript.pdf] accusing the Russian sports system of large-scale doping
fraud. They indicated that Russian athletics o cials supplied banned
substances in exchange for 5% of an athlete's earnings and falsi ed
tests together with doping control o cers.
In May 2016, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov [http://www.bbc.com/news/worldeurope-36833962] , the former Director of Moscow and Sochi doping
control laboratories, further alleged and detailed
[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/russia-doping-sochiolympics-2014.html?_r=2] widespread e orts facilitated by Russian
intelligence services to circumvent positive testing results for Russian
athletes. The WADA then engaged Professor Richard McLaren
[http://globalnews.ca/news/2831251/russian-doping-report-who-isrichard-mclaren/] to investigate allegations of Russian state
manipulation of the doping control process for Russian athletes. On July
18, the results of McLaren’s investigation were released in a report
[https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/doping-controlprocess/mclaren-independent-investigations-report-into-sochiallegations] that included ndings on Moscow’s involvement in
circumventing the testing process, including:

The State had the ability to transform a positive analytical result into
a negative one by ordering that the analytical process of the Moscow
Laboratory be altered. The Ministry of Sport (“MofS”), Russian AntiDoping Agency (RUSADA) and the Russian Federal Security Service
(the “FSB”) were all involved in this operation.

The MofS directed, controlled and oversaw the manipulation of
athletes’ analytical results and sample swapping, with the active
participation and assistance of the FSB; the Center of Sports
Preparation of National Teams of Russia (CSP); and, both Moscow
and Sochi laboratories.
Following the report, the WADA recommended [https://www.wadaama.org/en/media/news/2016-07/wada-statement-independentinvestigation-con rms-russian-state-manipulation-of] that all Russian
Olympic and Paralympic athletes be banned from the Rio games. The
IOC ultimately cleared 271 of the 389 Olympic athletes for competition
and the CAS upheld the ban [http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sportolympics-doping-idUSKCN101108] while the International Paralympic
Committee (IPC) banned the entire Russian Paralympic team from
participation.

FANCY BEAR Consistencies
Investigating the two domains provided in the WADA alert
[https://m.paralympic.org/news/wada-warns-stakeholders-phishingscams] -- wada-awa[.]org and wada-arna[.]org -- using SOA and WHOIS
records we were able to identify that they were registered by
rob_parks@mail[.]com and macie.dietrich50@mail[.]com respectively.
Leveraging capabilities from our partners at DomainTools
[http://www.domaintools.com/] , we were able to identify that
macie.dietrich50@mail[.]com had also registered one other domain -tas-cass[.]org -- approximately three hours before registering wadaarna[.]org on August 8th. We found no other domains registered by
rob_parks@mail[.]com.

The wada-awa[.]org and tas-cass[.]org domains are currently hosted at
the same 81.95.5[.]166 (Germany) IP address with no other domains.
While these domains were registered using di erent email addresses,
their hosting at the same IP with no other domains suggests they were
registered by the same individual or group. The wada-arna[.]org domain
is currently hosted on a dedicated server at 149.154.157[.]171 (Italy).
Based on passive DNS resolutions identi ed through PassiveTotal
[https://www.passivetotal.org/] and our integration with Farsight,
[https://www.farsightsecurity.com/] we were able to identify that several
subdomains for these domains are currently hosted on these IP

addresses. These subdomains most likely have been used in operations
against the WADA and/or CAS:
mail.wada-awa[.]org
inside.wada-arna[.]org
adfs.wada-awa[.]org

After taking a look at the name server information for the domains, we
identi ed that wada-awa[.]org was registered and uses a name server
from ITitch[.]com, a domain registrar that FANCY BEAR actors recently
used to register a domain for operations against the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee
[https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cant-scratch/] .
Wada-arna[.]org and tas-cass[.]org were registered through and use
name servers from Domains4bitcoins[.]com, a registrar that has also
been associated [https://threatconnect.com/blog/whats-in-a-nameserver/] with FANCY BEAR activity. Concentrations of FANCY BEAR
domains have been found on the name servers for both of these
registrars, and the registrars’ acceptance of anonymous Bitcoin
payment is desirable for actors seeking to avoid attribution. The
diamond model
[https://www.threatconnect.com/platform/methodology/] below shows

the relationship between the identi ed domains, their registration and
hosting information, known FANCY BEAR TTPs, and intended targets.

The WADA and CAS-spoo ng domains and activity most likely are
intended to support Russian government intelligence collection and/or
in uence operations related to the WADA and CAS. Our assessment is
based on the following ndings:

1. The registration of these domains on August 3rd and 8th, 2016 are
consistent with the timeline in which the WADA recommended
banning all Russian athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic
games.
2. The use of 1&1 mail.com webmail addresses to register domains
matches a TTP we previously identi ed
[https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cantscratch/] for FANCY BEAR actors.
3. These domains were registered through ititch[.]com and
domains4bitcoins[.]com, two registrars that accept Bitcoins for
payments. The use of such registrars also matches an identi ed
[https://threatconnect.com/blog/whats-in-a-name-server/] TTP for
FANCY BEAR actors. Two of our previous blog posts also highlighted
domains at the ITitch [https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-ititch-they-cant-scratch/] and Domains4bitcoins
[https://threatconnect.com/blog/whats-in-a-name-server/] name
servers and their associations to FANCY BEAR activity.
A review of recently registered domains using the same name servers
identi ed two other domains related to sports and athletics -- espncom[.]co and espn-live[.]co. Espn-live.co was registered through ITitch
on August 17. Espn-com[.]co was registered through ITitch on August 2,
a day before wada-awa[.]org was registered through the same service.
These domains no longer use ITitch name servers as both most likely
were taken over by MarkMonitor on ESPN’s behalf shortly after they
were registered. No information on the original registrants could be
identi ed and we do not have any indication that these domains were
used maliciously; however, based on the timing, subject matter, and
registrar used, this may represent an additional avenue through which
the actors intended to pursue WADA and CAS-related targets.

Anonymous Poland - What’s Their Role?

On August 12, 2016 hackread.com [https://www.hackread.com/worldanti-doping-agency-site-hacked/] broke the story that the WADA and
CAS had been hacked and thousands of accounts had been leaked. The
subtitle for the story read: Anonymous Poland Hacked World Anti-

doping Agency and Court of Arbitration for sport’s server’ server and
leaked personal details for God knows what reason!
We asked ourselves that very question - what beef does Anonymous
Poland (@anpoland [https://twitter.com/anpoland] ) have with WADA
and CAS? While it is plausible that the attacks were in response to the
Tomasz Zielinski being sent home [http://www.reuters.com/article/usolympics-rio-weightlifting-pole-idUSKCN10K1Y2] for testing positive for a
banned steroid nandrolone on August 9, such retaliation e orts are
atypical for Anonymous Poland, which has previously focused
[https://www.facebook.com/AnonPLorg/] on Polish politics and
perceived issues with the nancial, political, and media industries. To
that end, is it possible that @anpoland is another platform that Russians
are using to hide their hand in activity against the WADA and CAS?
WHITE PAPER: MATURING A THREAT INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM
[HTTP://HUBS.LY/H03SNJH0]

Of course, activity against WADA and CAS from hacktivists and Russian
state sponsored actors are not mutually exclusive, so it is entirely
possible that two groups could have targeted and/or compromised
these organizations at the same time. However, the timing associated
with the Russian phishing activity and Anonymous Poland’s claims are
very coincidental and suggest that the two may be involved. To that end,
we reviewed Anonymous Poland’s activities to determine whether they
are whom they claim to be. Our ndings include the following:
1. @anpoland posted a video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=day5Aq0bHsA] to Youtube that demonstrates how they
purportedly used Acunetix to scan the CAS website and SQLMap

[http://sqlmap.org/] to exploit CAS databases. The screen capture
video shows the individual using a local admin account with Polish
language settings. However, when the individual uses Firefox, we
see in their browser history that they have previously issued Google
searches from Google.ru (Russia) and Google.com (US) multiple
times while Google.pl (Poland) is absent.
Google.ru within the browser history might indicate that the user that
created the Youtube video is originating, or has previously originated,
from a Russian IP address. Although the user has Tor browser on their
desktop it appears as if they failed to execute it, as it does not appear as
an executing process during the hack demo.
WADA Browser History [https://youtu.be/day5Aq0bHsA?t=282]

TAS Browser History [https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=day5Aq0bHsA&feature=youtu.be&t=296]

1. The @anpoland Twitter account being cited by various news outlets
as a source for this story, appears to have been inactive until the
end of July 2016.
1. The @anpoland account was established in April 2010, the
same timeframe as when Polish Air Force Flight 101
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu154_crash] crashed several hundred meters short of the
Smolensk airport runway in dense fog, killing everyone on
board, including Polish President Kaczyński. Russia’s nal
report on the incident blamed the late president and his
“inebriated” air force commander-in-chief for the accident.
2. Beginning on August 1, the @anpoland account essentially
resurfaced with claims that it had hacked the Ukrainian
Ministry of Internal A airs and released hacked documents
pertaining at gmarine.com[.]ua - a Ukrainian website hosted
on a Russian IP.
3. It’s important to note that while the @anpoland account has a
gap in posts from 2010 to 2016, it is possible the individual(s)
running the account deleted older posts.

2. Other social media accounts claiming a liation with Anonymous
Poland, such as @anonpoland [https://twitter.com/anonpoland] ,
and Anonymous’ main twitter account
[https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/] are not publicizing the WADA
compromise. The inability to con rm the @anpoland and HackRead
story with several additional Anonymous Poland-related sources is
suspect.
1. Anonymous Poland Facebook
[https://www.facebook.com/AnonPLorg/] accounts identi ed
to date are focused on internal Polish politics and current
events, apart from some posts referencing ISIS, most of the
communications released call for action (mostly peaceful
physical protests) in response to perceived issues with the
nancial, political, and media industries in the country.
At this time, based on a lack of sources, we cannot conclude that
@anpoland is another platform that Russian actors are using for
in uence operations. However, mounting circumstantial evidence that
negate @anpoland’s claimed origins makes us skeptical that they are in
fact a legitimate Anonymous hacktivist group.

Fancy Bear’s Roid Rage
Ultimately, successful operations against WADA and CAS stakeholders
could yield Russia with intelligence that could facilitate the following:
1. Follow-on operations seeking to in uence or coerce individuals in
key decision-making positions within those organizations. Such
in uence might ultimately result in decisions from those
organizations that bene t Russian athletes.
2. Document or data collection that can be used in in uence
operations or propaganda derisive to the WADA, CAS, or their

stakeholders.
3. Follow-on operations targeting speci c individuals to gain additional
collection.
4. Intelligence collection that informs Russian e orts to circumvent
doping and testing procedures, like those described in the McLaren
Report.
5. Publicly intimidate other potential whistleblowers and deter them
from coming forward.
As evidenced in the Stepanova compromise [https://www.wadaama.org/en/media/news/2016-08/wada-con rms-illegal-activity-onyuliya-stepanovas-adams-account] , we would also expect to see
additional Russian cyber operations targeting Professor McLaren and
the main source of the investigation, Dr. Rodchenkov. Collection against
these individuals could also facilitate Russian e orts like those
previously listed, or e ort to conduct in uence operations that privately
intimidate or publicly cast those individuals in a negative light.
Russian activity targeting these organizations is an important example
of how Russia responds to wide-reaching current events that have
negative implications for Moscow. Organizations involved in such events
can reasonably expect to experience targeted Russian cyber operations
that ultimately facilitate retaliatory in uence or propaganda e orts
against them. Knowledge of this TTP, and others associated with
Russian APT activity, can help those organizations augment their
security posture and defend against such retaliation.
ThreatConnect would very much like to work with WADA and Yuliya
Stepanova if either would be open to sharing any details to help us
better understand the details surrounding this event feel free to contact
us.
