If malware outbreak was state sponsored it could count as violation of sovereignty and open
possibility of countermeasures, says Tomáš Minárik

The NotPetya malware that wiped computers at organisations including Maersk, Merck and
the Ukrainian government in June “could count as a violation of sovereignty”, according to a
legal researcher at a Nato-affiliated cybersecurity organisation.
If the malware outbreak was state-sponsored, the researcher says, it could open the
possiblity of “countermeasures”. Those could come through retaliatory cyber--attacks, or
more conventional means such as sanctions, but they must fall short of a military use of
force.
Tomáš Minárik, a researcher at the Nato Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in
Tallinn, Estonia, made the comments after the Centre concluded that the malware outbreak,
which overwhelmingly hit Ukraine but also affected more than 60 other countries, can most
likely be attributed to a state actor.
While a cyber-attack can trigger an armed response from Nato, Minárik cautioned that the
damage caused by NotPetya was not sufficient for such an escalation. The law of armed
conflict applies only if a cyber-attack causes damage “with consequences comparable to an
armed attack”, during an ongoing international armed conflict, “but so far there are reports of
neither,” he said.

However, Minárik, added, “as important government systems have been targeted, then in
case the operation is attributed to a state this could count as a violation of sovereignty.
Consequently, this could be an internationally wrongful act, which might give the targeted
states several options to respond with countermeasures.”
A countermeasure is any state response which would be illegal in typical circumstances, but
can be authorised as a reaction to an internationally wrongful act by another state. A “hack
back” response, for instance, could be a countermeasure, but Nato CCDCOE says that such
responses “do not necessarily have to be conducted by cyber means”; they cannot, however,
affect third countries, nor can they amount to a use of force.
The suspicion that NotPetya – so called because the malware is superficially similar to an
earlier ransomware variant called Petya – may be the work of a state sponsored actor arose
shortly after the outbreak began in late June.
While the malware appears to be ransomware (a type of program which holds critical files
hostage in exchange for payment), it contained several flaws that prevented it from ever
being an effective moneymaker for its creators. Among other things, the payment
infrastructure was tied to one email address outside their control, which was promptly
blocked by the webmail provider, preventing victims form ever receiving their decryption key
and unlocking their files.
But the malware, which was overwhelmingly seeded to victims through a compromised
Ukrainian accounting program, did function well as a “wiper”, designed simply to render
systems unusable and cause economic damage. It spread rapidly inside business networks,
using a combination of exploits stolen from the NSA and more common weaknesses in older
versions of Windows, ensuring that whole organisations found themselves unable to operate
for days on end.
Unlike WannaCry, an earlier piece of ransomware also suspected of being the work of statesponsored attackers (in that case, explicitly linked to North Korea by intelligence agencies
including the NSA and GCHQ), NotPetya did not contain any functionality enabling it to
spread unconstrained across the internet, limiting the vast majority of its damage to those
organisations directly infected by the compromised accounting software.
