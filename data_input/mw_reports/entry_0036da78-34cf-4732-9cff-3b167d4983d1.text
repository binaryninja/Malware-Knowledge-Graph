Ghostwriter in the Shell:

Expanding on Mandiant’s Attribution
of UNC1151 to Belarus

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Key Judgments

This research expands on Mandiant’s public attribution of UNC1151
and Ghostwriter activity to entities in Belarus and describes Russian
military organizational influence in Minsk, substantiating a likely nexus
to Russian interests. The time frame for our research spans between
March 2017 through the present and employs data from the Recorded
Future Platform with open source enrichment. It is intended to provide a
foundation for understanding the relationship between the threat actor(s)
and the broader influences and drivers for activity, as well as augment
existing cybersecurity industry reporting and address established
knowledge gaps in the understanding of UNC1151 and Ghostwriter
activity. This report will be of interest to cybersecurity professionals who
track advanced persistent threat actors as well as those seeking greater
information on UNC1151 and Ghostwriter.

Executive Summary
On November 16, 2021, Mandiant analysts presented
their recent research findings on activity conducted by
the cyber threat actor they have designated as UNC1151
and provided insights into the joint cyber and information
operations-enabled campaign designated Ghostwriter.
The Mandiant team assessed with high confidence
that the Belarusian government was responsible for
UNC1151 activity that primarily targets European entities
and assessed with moderate confidence that the same
entity or entities were largely behind the Ghostwriter
information operations activity. Nevertheless, Mandiant
research did not rule out the possibility of potential
Russian government, or other international, involvement
in the campaign.
Thus far, there has been a lack of technical evidence
indicating Russian involvement, but this is very likely
an intended component of the threat activity. We
have found many overlaps in tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) used by UNC1151 and Ghostwriter
activity and Russian threat activity groups. Additionally,
we note that false flags are prevalent among Russian
military advanced persistent threat groups, almost
certainly due to their training in the Russian military
discipline of maskirovka, or deception. Such activity
enables Russian military aligned advanced persistent
threat (APT) groups to plan and conduct activity in a way
that enables plausible deniability. We also emphasize
the widespread presence of the Russian military in
Belarus, as well as evidence of other Russian high-level
influence and training, which all suggest likely Russian
involvement and influence in Belarus.

• Recorded Future does not dispute findings presented
by Mandiant in November 2021, which suggest technical
links between UNC1151 and Ghostwriter operations and
the Belarusian government, likely affiliated with the
Belarusian military.
• There is ample evidence to suggest that Russian
government entities, specifically entities within the
Russian military and academic sector, are likely
interacting with the Belarusian government on matters of
cybersecurity and information confrontation.
• We have identified reports of high-level meetings
between Russian and Belarusian Security Services
officials, which indicates that cooperation between the 2
is likely.
• It is likely that Russian military entities, potentially
including individuals affiliated with Russian Main
Intelligence Directorate (GRU/GU)-related APT groups,
operated from, supported, or trained individuals and
organizations in Belarus; this assessment is based on
long-term Russian Ministry of Defense operations in
Belarus.
• The interactions between these entities provide the
foundation necessary for Russian state-affiliated military
intelligence units to use Belarus as a base of operations
or train Belarusian personnel in the disciplines of
information warfare and cyber operations.
• The Ghostwriter campaign, along with the UNC1151
activity, was composed of concurrent cyber activity
and information operations; GRU/GU APT groups have
consistently engaged in operations that leverage multiple
aspects of the information domain. These groups highly
likely have the capability and intent to conduct aspects
of the Ghostwriter campaign and UNC1151 activity.
• Russian GRU/GU APT groups have consistently employed
proxies in past operations or engaged in false flag
operations to mask their involvement in cyber intrusions;
conducting Ghostwriter/UNC1151 activity from Belarusian
territory, or involving Belarusian forces in the effort,
would likely offer a similar approach to masking Russian
involvement.
• The relevance of this research, and the importance
of describing the Russian government involvement in
Belarusian Ghostwriter and UNC1151 threat activity, is
that it reveals how the Russian military can operate from
foreign territory or leverage proxies to create challenges
to attribution. The synthesis of technical and contextual
data, enabled by the Recorded Future platform, can
alleviate challenges to attribution.

Background
Ghostwriter is the designator for an information operations and
credential harvesting campaign that has occurred concurrently
with likely cyber espionage activity conducted, at least in part,
by a threat activity group that FireEye designates UNC1151.
According to FireEye, UNC1151 has engaged in infrastructure
development, credential harvesting, spearphishing, and targeted
intrusions, and Ghostwriter activity largely consisted of social
media and website compromise, as well as the development
and dissemination of false narratives or forged materials and
correspondence to promote divisive narratives. The primary
targets for this activity have been NATO-related entities,
German politicians, interests in the Baltic region (primarily Latvia
and Lithuania), Ukrainian entities, Polish interests, as well as
other targets in Colombia, Kuwait, and Ireland. Some of the
areas subject to the intrusion and influence activity were also
subjected to prior efforts conducted by Russian Main Intelligence
Directorate (GRU/GU) groups, as shown in Figure 1.

statements by the President of the German Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Thomas Haldenwang, who

Russian GRU military intelligence units to be responsible for the
activity.

On November 16, 2021, Mandiant researchers released
a report and concurrent presentation at CYBERWARCON that
assessed “with high confidence that UNC1151 is linked to the
Belarusian government” and proposed “with moderate confidence
that Belarus is also likely at least partially responsible for the
Ghostwriter campaign”. According to their research, “Sensitively
sourced technical evidence indicates that the operators behind
UNC1151 are likely located in Minsk, Belarus … In addition,
separate technical evidence supports a link between the
operators behind UNC1151 and the Belarusian military”. Mandiant
researchers maintain that this evidence was either validated by
multiple sources or directly observed by their team. Furthermore,

This operation has historically targeted democratic governments and institutions
abroad with stories intended to generate rage, confusion, and doubt among
domestic audiences in the targeted regions.

A November 17, 2021 article by investigative journalist group
Bellingcat on the topic of Russian private military company (PMC)
Wagner activity in Belarus confirmed that the Tu-214VPU RA64523 traveled from Moscow to Minsk. Additionally, Bellingcat
indicated that “at least 3 Russian military and/or FSB planes made
previously unannounced trips to Minsk in the week following the
elections, including 2 flights on 12 August”.

Research reveals that during the period in which the Russian
government applied pressure to Belarus to further integrate their
economic, political, and military structures, specifically between
2017 and 2019, “The number of online resources which regularly
publish items related to Belarus and contain disinformation,
propaganda narratives and hate speech [had] increased”.
Additionally, “A fully-fledged coordinated network of regional
online portals with regular publications containing hate speech
against various social, political, religious, and professional
groups of the Belarusian population began its activity in 2018”.
Organizers of the sites promoting such speech frequently
promoted the development of a Union State, and some had
indirect links to the Russian Embassy in Belarus. A separate
research study indicated that around this same period “60%
of programming broadcast by TV channels available in Belarus
consists of content produced in Russia”. The research went on
to note that the Belarusian government seldom pushed back
against efforts by these outlets to promote false claims, stating
that the only instances in which the Belarusian government
became involved with fighting false claims were those involving
material critical of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

This is not the only visit by high-level Russian government
officials, as open source reporting indicates that on October
22, 2020, director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service
(SVR) Sergei Naryshkin traveled to Minsk. According to the
report, encrypted chats on Telegram speculated that the
purpose of the visit was a meeting between Naryshkin and
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. A separate media
report indicated that Naryshkin and Lukashenko discussed joint
operations, notably how the Russian special services could
support Belarus, specifically in matters of common interest. A
subsequent meeting between Naryshkin and the Chairman of the
State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (KGB), Ivan
Tertel, was held on June 3, 2021, where the prospect for joint

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

On February 26, 2021, Belarus’s state-owned news agency
Belta cited Alexey Avdonin, a Belarusian analyst with the
Belarusian Institute of Strategic Research (BISR), as advocating
for Belarus and Russia to engage in a “joint information
confrontation” with their opponents. Information confrontation
is a Russian military term that describes how to engage in
conflict across several domains within the information space
that governs, at a minimum, strategic approaches to information
operations (IO), cyber activity, psychological operations, and
electronic warfare (EW). Such efforts by the Russian military and
intelligence/security apparatus are not only conducted in times
of open conflict between states, but also occur persistently,
targeting both military and non-military targets in an attempt to
aid Russian forces in maintaining a favorable position in relation
to other nations.

Based on the experience of the collapse of
the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia, and on the
examples of the colour revolutions in Georgia,
Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, and elsewhere, one can
clearly see that major threats do objectively
exist and are implemented not only by military
means, but primarily by covert and overt
methods of political and diplomatic, economic,
and information influence, various subversive
actions and interference in the internal affairs
of other countries. In this regard, Russian
security interests require not only to assess
these threats but also to determine appropriate
measures to respond to them.

In addition to these statements, Recorded Future identified

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

In another technique overlap, and also in the indictment,
the Department of Justice describes how later in October 2016,
Sandworm targeted Ukraine’s State Treasury Service with
malware enabled via macros (MITRE ATT&CK Subtechnique
T1137.001), a technique also noted in UNC1151’s February 2020
likely targeting of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, according to
Mandiant’s reporting from April 2021. This technique is employed
by a number of groups and not specific to Sandworm. However,
it is notable that there are several areas in which we see these
overlaps with GRU-related groups like Sandworm and APT28
arise.
In an April 28, 2021 report, FireEye indicated that the
following MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) were affiliated with UNC1151. We have identified several,
broad overlaps in these TTPs between and other known GRU
related threat activity groups.
• T1547.001: Achieving persistence by adding a program to
a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key.
This is a common tactic as threat activity groups across
the spectrum employ this approach for persistence,
including APT28, as reported in this December 2020
Trend Micro report.
• T1218.005: Mshta, a utility that executes Microsoft HTML
Applications (HTA) files. APT28 employed mshta in the
Windows post-exploitation framework and penetration
testing tool Koadic in 2018, as indicated in this Palo Alto
report.
• T1059.005: Employing Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) for
execution. While this technique, like the use of Registry
Run Keys, is very common, it is another area in which
overlap occurs with several Russian advanced persistent
threat groups, including those affiliated with the GRU like
Sandworm. Both Dragos and ESET (1, 2, 3) have detailed
Sandrworm’s use of VBS scripts since at least 2015.
• T1071: Application Layer Protocol. No overlaps have
been found with GRU-related threat actors; however, it
is notable that Russian APT Dragonfly has employed this
technique when targeting the energy and other critical
infrastructure sectors, as indicated in this Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) alert.

• T1105: The transfer of tools from an actor-controlled
system to a compromised host, or “Ingress Tool Transfer”,
is a technique common to many threat activity groups.
Notably, however, APT28 has also employed this in their
operations, as noted by a July 2021 joint Cyber Security
Advisory by the National Security Agency (NSA), CISA,
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National
Cyber Security Center (NCSC). Additionally, according
to an October 2020 Department of Justice (DoJ)
Indictment Sandworm also remotely installed additional
tools on compromised hosts in 2017 when targeting an
information technology company.
• T1140: The use of obfuscation and deobfuscation or
decoding encrypted files or information in intrusion
activity is another technique highly common to many APT
groups. We note that, according to a June 2018 Palo Alto

• T1056: Input Capture. Both APT28 and Sandworm employ
the keylogging sub-technique T1056.001 of input capture
in their operations. A July 2018 indictment and Trend

an ESET report describes Sandworm’s use of key logging.
• T1059.001: Command and Scripting Interpreter:
PowerShell. This tactic is also widely used by many
threat activity groups. Inclusive of the GRU affiliated
groups using PowerShell commands and scripts for
execution are both APT28 and Sandworm. APT28’s use of
Powershell scripting is called out in the aforementioned
December 2020 Trend Micro report as well as the July
2021 joint Cyber Security Advisory. Sandworm’s use
of Powershell scripting was noted in an October 2018
Dragos’ report as well as the previously referenced
October 2020 DoJ Indictment against operators from this
threat group.

JavaScript. No overlaps found with GRU related threat
actors however it is notable that Russian APT Turla
has employed JavaScript backdoors, as described by a
January 2018 report.
• T1559.002: The use of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to
execute arbitrary commands has been used by APT28
according to a McAfee November 2017 report as well as
the previously discussed June 2018 Palo Alto report.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Finally, Sandworm attempted engage in a false-flag operation
during the February 2018 Olympic Destroyer attacks targeting
the PyeongChang Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony; at that
time, Sandworm attempted to “mimic the malware of other
hacking groups-including the Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored
hacking team in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” to
divert attention from Russian attribution. Given that this group
has employed high-level techniques and tactics such as these,
which broadly overlap with UNC1151/Ghostwriter activity, and
taking into account that Sandworm is known for conducting false
flag operations, it is well within the realm of possibility that the
efforts attributed to Belarus may have a nexus to this, or other,
Russian APT groups.
Overlaps With Historical APT28 TTPs

We believe that Ghostwriter is a closely related, near-parallel
information operation to Secondary Infektion, but continue to
assess that Secondary Infektion is a broadly defined family of
Active Measures campaigns, which include conventional forgeries
planted in low-tier sources and forgeries planted through novel
intrusion means (such as Ghostwriter). Both what has been
observed as Secondary Infektion (non-cyber threat activity, with
the exception of the 2019 NHS leaks), and Ghostwriter, each
share common themes and content dissemination, most notably
in historical campaigns targeting NATO and sensitively sourced
intelligence more recently indicating active Secondary Infektion
operations against the Belarus/Lithuania migrant crisis. With the
exception of intrusion activity, we have observed overlaps in the
information operations TTPs of both activity sets in a few cases,
namely the use of multiple-use, established personas in a few
select examples, as well as passive emulation of real individuals.

In addition to the described high-level overlaps between

Recorded Future believes that Secondary Infektion, as
well as the Ghostwriter campaign, are 2 aspects of information
operations consistent with Russian “active measures” 6, an
approach to psychological and narrative warfare developed
during the Soviet era that is almost certainly still practiced
today by Russian government security service operatives as
well as Russian private sector contractors, such as the Internet
Research Agency (IRA, or Lakhta Internet Research, LIR).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Outlook
In this research, we have laid out extensive indicators of
likely Russian and Belarusian cooperation, including high-level
meetings, cyberwarfare training, and public statements. Although
we may not have direct visibility into the inner workings of the
military intelligence cooperation between the two countries, we
have explained the mechanisms that laid the foundation for it as
well as the avenues by which it is likely occurring. Additionally,
we have detailed the manner in which such cooperation is
mutually beneficial, as the activity allows Belarus to improve its
technological capabilities in the information warfare space while
allowing Russia the ability to escape culpability for its actions.
Therefore, it is likely that if attribution of UNC1151 and
Ghostwriter is limited to Belarus, it likely benefits Russian statesponsored threat activity groups, given that it provides plausible
deniability for their operations. Furthermore, such attribution
likely emboldens Russian state-sponsored threat activity groups
to seek out other similarly hospitable locations to base their
operations to provide further challenges to attribution. There
have already been indications of Russian information operations
moving abroad. A shift in cyber operations to friendly or allied
nations could further grant threat actors plausible deniability.
Also, a shift of Russian operational activity to Belarus and the
attribution of UNC1151 and Ghostwriter campaign activity solely
to Belarus likely risks further alienating Belarus from European
allies and threatens any long-term viability of engagement with
NATO through the PfP program. Although this may not be the
original goal in moving the activity to this location, it appears
to be an added benefit for Russian threat actors seeking to
drive a wedge between the nations within the Russian sphere of
influence and NATO and its allies.
