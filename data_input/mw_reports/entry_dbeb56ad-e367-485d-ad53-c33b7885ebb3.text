ESET researchers have discovered new versions of the DanaBot Trojan, updated with a more
complicated protocol for C&C communication and slight modifications to architecture and campaign IDs
The fast-evolving, modular Trojan DanaBot has undergone further changes, with the latest version
featuring an entirely new communication protocol. The protocol, introduced to DanaBot at the end of
January 2019, adds several layers of encryption to DanaBot’s C&C communication.
Besides the changes in communication, DanaBot’s architecture and campaign IDs have also been
modified.

The evolution of DanaBot
After being discovered in May 2018 as part of Australia-targeted spam campaigns, DanaBot has had an
eventful time since, appearing in malspam campaigns in Poland, Italy, Germany, Austria and Ukraine, as
well as in the United States. The European campaigns have seen the Trojan expanding its capabilities
with new plugins and spam-sending features.
In ESET telemetry on January 25, 2019, we noticed unusual DanaBot-related executables. Upon further
inspection, these binaries were, indeed, revealed to be DanaBot variants, but using a different
communication protocol to communicate with the C&C server. Starting January 26, 2019, DanaBot
operators stopped building binaries with the old protocol.
At the time of writing, the new version is being distributed under two scenarios:
As “updates” delivered to existing DanaBot victims
Via malspam in Poland

The new communication protocol
In the communication protocol used before January 25, packets were not encrypted in any way, as seen
in Figure 1.

Following the latest changes, DanaBot uses the AES and RSA encryption algorithms in its C&C
communication. The new communication protocol is complicated, with several encryption layers being
used, as seen in Figure 2.

These changes break existing network-based signatures and make it more difficult to write new rules for
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems. Also, without access to the corresponding RSA keys, it is
impossible to decode sent or received packets; thus PCAP files from cloud-based analysis systems
(such as ANY.RUN) become unusable for researchers.

Each packet sent by the client has a 24 (0x18)-byte header:

Sum of first two fields

For each packet, the header is followed by AES-encrypted packet data, then a 4-byte value indicating
AES padding size, and finally the RSA-encrypted AES key. Each packet is encrypted with a different
AES key.
Server responses use the same format. Unlike in previous versions, packet data in server responses
does not follow any specific layout (with some exceptions).

Packet data layout
Former packet data layout was detailed by Proofpoint in October 2018. In the latest version of DanaBot,
the layout is slightly modified, as seen in Figure 4.

Changes in DanaBot architecture
Besides the changed communication protocol, DanaBot has also undergone some changes in
architecture. The previous versions of DanaBot included a component that downloaded and executed
the main module. The main module then downloaded and executed plugins and configurations.
The latest version shifts both these responsibilities to a new loader component, which is used to
download all plugins along with the main module. Persistence is achieved by registering the loader
component as a service.

Commands
According to our analysis, the loader component uses the following commands:
0x12C – Hello. First command sent by client to server
0x12D – Download 32/64-bit launcher component
0x12E – Request list of plugins and configuration files
0x12F – Download plugin/configuration files
Downloaded plugins and configuration files are encrypted using an AES key derived from the Client ID.
In addition to that, plugins are compressed in ZIP format using LZMA compression, whereas
configuration files are compressed using zlib.
Commands with ID numbers 0x130 – 0x134 are sent by the main module:
0x130 – Upload collected information to C&C server (e.g., screenshot of a victim’s computer;
system information)
0x131 – Upload collected information to C&C server (e.g., list of files on the victim’s hard disk)
0x132 – Ask C&C server for further commands; there are around 30 available commands typical
of backdoors, including launching plugins, gathering detailed system information and modifying
files on client system
0x133 – Update C&C server list via Tor proxy
0x134 – Exact purpose unknown; most likely used for communication between plugins and C&C

Changes in campaign IDs
Previous research has suggested that DanaBot is distributed under various “affiliate” or “campaign” IDs.
In the previous version of DanaBot, almost 20 different campaign IDs were used. In the latest version,
campaign IDs have changed slightly. As of February 5, 2019, we are seeing the following IDs in the wild:
ID=2 appears to be a test version, serving a limited number of configuration files and no
webinjects
ID=3 is being actively spread, targeting users in both Poland and Italy, serving all configuration
files and webinjects for both Polish and Italian targets
ID=5 serves configuration files for Australian targets
ID=7 is being spread only in Poland, serving webinjects for Polish targets
ID=9 appears to be another test version, with limited spread and no specific targeting, serving a
limited number of configuration files and no webinjects

Conclusion
In 2018, we observed DanaBot expanding in both distribution and functionality. The beginning of 2019
has seen the Trojan undergo “internal” changes, indicating active development by its authors. The latest
updates suggest the authors are making an effort to evade detection at the network level, and possibly
paying attention to published research and making changes to stay ahead of defenders.
ESET systems detect and block all DanaBot components and plugins under detection names listed in
the IoCs section.
This research was carried out by Kaspars Osis, Tomáš Procházka and Michal Kolář.
