Dragos first disclosed four new threat activity groups targeting ICS/OT in the ICS
Cybersecurity 2020 Year in Review report. In this blog post, we will provide more
information on one of the new groups: TALONITE. The fundamental assessment of threats
tracked by Dragos is that they are explicitly attempting to gain access to ICS networks and
operations or are successful in achieving access, not simply trying to gain access to an
industrial organization. To learn more about ICS threat activity groups and how they’re
created, we invite you to read our blog post “Uncovering ICS Threat Activity Groups.”
Activity Group: a set of intrusion events related with varying degrees of confidence
by similarities in their features or processes used to answer analytic questions and
develop broad mitigation strategies that achieve effects beyond the immediate threat.

Dragos ICS Cybersecurity 2020 Year In Review

TALONITE Activity Group Overview
Dragos began tracking the TALONITE activity group in July 2019 with operations focusing
on initial access compromises in the United States (U.S.) electric sector. The group uses
phishing techniques with either malicious documents or executables. TALONITE uses two
custom malware families that both feature multiple components known as LookBack and
FlowCloud.
TALONITE focuses on subverting and taking advantage of trust with phishing lures focusing
on engineering-specific themes and concepts, malware that abuses otherwise legitimate
binaries or modifies such binaries to include additional functionality , and a combination of
owned and compromised network infrastructure. This activity is difficult to track and contain
given the group’s propensity to blend techniques and tactics in order to ensure a successful
intrusion. There is behavioral and tooling overlap between TALONITE and activity known by
some as APT10. Alleged members of APT10 were indicted in 2018.

Detecting and Mitigating TALONITE Activity
TALONITE gains initial enterprise network access via spearphishing activity that leverages
malicious documents and executables. The lures (Figure 2) focus on engineering-specific
themes and concepts, and distributed malware known as FlowCloud and LookBack.

The malware incorporates multiple components including legitimate items such as
certutil.exe from Microsoft that the malware abuses, or malware components items
masquerading as legitimate utilities such as the malicious proxy tool GUP.exe , named after
a legitimate Notepad++ executable.
The infrastructure appears to be shared or reused through the overlapping LookBack and
FlowCloud campaigns. Dragos previously identified infrastructure associated with LookBack
and concurrently used in FlowCloud activity. Most items indicate an adversary registering,
hosting, and maintaining infrastructure on controlled servers. TALONITE registers domains
masquerading as legitimate engineering or regulatory bodies and uses mostly adversaryowned and -controlled domains and servers, occasionally using legitimate but compromised
infrastructure.
Dragos did not observe any lateral movement for TALONITE. Based on the capabilities of
LookBack and FlowCloud, both of which facilitate various means of credential capture,
Dragos assesses with high confidence that TALONITE lateral movement incorporates
credential reuse. Both malware types are Remote Access Trojans (RAT) that contain
capabilities to establish persistence within the environment. LookBack malware contains
persistence mechanisms that add two Windows registry keys to execute legitimate but
maliciously modified files when the infected user next logs in.
To obtain persistence, FlowCloud performs minor operations on the system then launches a
renamed copy of the legitimate HTML Help Workshop (hhw.exe) utility from Microsoft.
Extensive database and related processes are used to capture host data that is stored in
those database files in a subdirectory of the legitimate but renamed utility.
The Dragos Platform incorporates multiple detections and analytics designed specifically to
detect credential reuse and malicious logon activity. Such tactics are deployed by multiple
activity groups tracked by Dragos, making coverage of such abuse vital for ICS network
protection. In the ICS Cybersecurity 2020 Year in Review, Dragos found that 90 percent of
its services customers lacked fundamental visibility into ICS environments. This means
most ICS asset owners and operators will be blind to threats and lack critical cybersecurity
data. Learn more about the value of asset visibility in building a comprehensive OT
cybersecurity program by downloading our OT asset visibility white paper.
Detections for all TALONITE behaviors are available in the Dragos Platform.

ICS Considerations for the Future
There is no evidence indicating TALONITE has executed a disruptive ICS attack or
penetrated control system networks in a victim environment. Targeting behavior from July
2019 through the present strongly indicates that TALONITE is exclusively focused on the
electric sector, especially within the United States. TALONITE at minimum represents an
initial access and information gathering capability leveraged against multiple entities within
5/6

the U.S. electric sector over an extended period of time. TALONITE focuses on U.S. electric
utilities, with some evidence of capabilities targeting unknown entities in Japan and Taiwan
prior to 2019.
Dragos cannot definitively link TALONITE to any known intrusion set or state interest,
despite behaviors and tooling that suggest an overlap with APT10 (also referred to as
menuPass and STONE PANDA). TALONITE’s targeting focus on critical engineering, and
power generation and distribution know-how within electric utilities is consistent with a wellresourced adversary with strong long-term interests in industrial control and grid operations.
TALONITE targets U.S. electric utilities for initial access and information gathering. Although
TALONITE is not associated with any known and deliberate ICS disruptive event,
TALONITE’s identified behaviors and capabilities do not rule out future ICS-targeting
operations. While TALONITE’s relationship to People’s Republic of China (PRC) strategic
interests is unknown, sufficient information identifies this group as an emerging and serious
threat to security in the electric sector.
