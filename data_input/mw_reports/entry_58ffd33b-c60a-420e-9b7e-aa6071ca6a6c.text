GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Executive Summary
This document provides guidance for establishing secure industrial control systems (ICS). These ICS,
which include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems
(DCS), and other control system configurations such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are often
found in the industrial control sectors. ICS are typically used in industries such as electric, water and
wastewater, oil and natural gas, transportation, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, food and
beverage, and discrete manufacturing (e.g., automotive, aerospace, and durable goods.) SCADA systems
are generally used to control dispersed assets using centralized data acquisition and supervisory control.
DCS are generally used to control production systems within a local area such as a factory using
supervisory and regulatory control. PLCs are generally used for discrete control for specific applications
and generally provide regulatory control. These control systems are vital to the operation of the U.S.
critical infrastructures that are often highly interconnected and mutually dependent systems. It is
important to note that approximately 90 percent of the nation's critical infrastructures are privately owned
and operated. Federal agencies also operate many of the ICS mentioned above; other examples include air
traffic control and materials handling (e.g., Postal Service mail handling.) This document provides an
overview of these ICS and typical system topologies, identifies typical threats and vulnerabilities to these
systems, and provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks.
Initially, ICS had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems in that ICS were
isolated systems running proprietary control protocols using specialized hardware and software. Many
ICS components were in physically secured areas and the components were not connected to IT networks
or systems. Widely available, low-cost Internet Protocol (IP) devices are now replacing proprietary
solutions, which increases the possibility of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents. As ICS are
adopting IT solutions to promote corporate business systems connectivity and remote access capabilities,
and are being designed and implemented using industry standard computers, operating systems (OS) and
network protocols, they are starting to resemble IT systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities,
but it provides significantly less isolation for ICS from the outside world than predecessor systems,
creating a greater need to secure these systems. The increasing use of wireless networking places ICS
implementations at greater risk from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not
have direct physical access to the equipment. While security solutions have been designed to deal with
these security issues in typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same
solutions to ICS environments. In some cases, new security solutions are needed that are tailored to the
ICS environment.
Although some characteristics are similar, ICS also have characteristics that differ from traditional
information processing systems. Many of these differences stem from the fact that logic executing in ICS
has a direct effect on the physical world. Some of these characteristics include significant risk to the
health and safety of human lives and serious damage to the environment, as well as serious financial
issues such as production losses, negative impact to a nation’s economy, and compromise of proprietary
information. ICS have unique performance and reliability requirements and often use operating systems
and applications that may be considered unconventional to typical IT personnel. Furthermore, the goals of
safety and efficiency sometimes conflict with security in the design and operation of control systems.
ICS cybersecurity programs should always be part of broader ICS safety and reliability programs at both
industrial sites and enterprise cybersecurity programs, because cybersecurity is essential to the safe and
reliable operation of modern industrial processes. Threats to control systems can come from numerous
sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled employees, malicious intruders,
complexities, accidents, and natural disasters as well as malicious or accidental actions by insiders. ICS
security objectives typically follow the priority of availability and integrity, followed by confidentiality.

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Possible incidents an ICS may face include the following:
 Blocked or delayed flow of information through ICS networks, which could disrupt ICS operation.
 Unauthorized changes to instructions, commands, or alarm thresholds, which could damage, disable,
or shut down equipment, create environmental impacts, and/or endanger human life.
 Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disguise unauthorized changes, or to cause
the operators to initiate inappropriate actions, which could have various negative effects.
 ICS software or configuration settings modified, or ICS software infected with malware, which could
have various negative effects.
 Interference with the operation of equipment protection systems, which could endanger costly and
difficult-to-replace equipment.
 Interference with the operation of safety systems, which could endanger human life.
Major security objectives for an ICS implementation should include the following:
 Restricting logical access to the ICS network and network activity. This may include using
unidirectional gateways, a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network architecture with firewalls to prevent
network traffic from passing directly between the corporate and ICS networks, and having separate
authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the corporate and ICS networks. The ICS
should also use a network topology that has multiple layers, with the most critical communications
occurring in the most secure and reliable layer.
 Restricting physical access to the ICS network and devices. Unauthorized physical access to
components could cause serious disruption of the ICS’s functionality. A combination of physical
access controls should be used, such as locks, card readers, and/or guards.
 Protecting individual ICS components from exploitation. This includes deploying security patches
in as expeditious a manner as possible, after testing them under field conditions; disabling all unused
ports and services and assuring that they remain disabled; restricting ICS user privileges to only those
that are required for each person’s role; tracking and monitoring audit trails; and using security
controls such as antivirus software and file integrity checking software where technically feasible to
prevent, deter, detect, and mitigate malware.
 Restricting unauthorized modification of data. This includes data that is in transit (at least across
the network boundaries) and at rest.
 Detecting security events and incidents. Detecting security events, which have not yet escalated
into incidents, can help defenders break the attack chain before attackers attain their objectives. This
includes the capability to detect failed ICS components, unavailable services, and exhausted resources
that are important to provide proper and safe functioning of the ICS.
 Maintaining functionality during adverse conditions. This involves designing the ICS so that each
critical component has a redundant counterpart. Additionally, if a component fails, it should fail in a
manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the ICS or other networks, or does not cause
another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event. The ICS should also allow for graceful
degradation such as moving from "normal operation" with full automation to "emergency operation"
with operators more involved and less automation to "manual operation" with no automation.

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Restoring the system after an incident. Incidents are inevitable and an incident response plan is
essential. A major characteristic of a good security program is how quickly the system can be
recovered after an incident has occurred.
To properly address security in an ICS, it is essential for a cross-functional cybersecurity team to share
their varied domain knowledge and experience to evaluate and mitigate risk to the ICS. The cybersecurity
team should consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, control engineer, control system operator,
network and system security expert, a member of the management staff, and a member of the physical
security department at a minimum. For continuity and completeness, the cybersecurity team should
consult with the control system vendor and/or system integrator as well. The cybersecurity team should
coordinate closely with site management (e.g., facility superintendent) and the company’s Chief
Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO), who in turn, accepts complete responsibility
and accountability for the cybersecurity of the ICS, and for any safety incidents, reliability incidents, or
equipment damage caused directly or indirectly by cyber incidents. An effective cybersecurity program
for an ICS should apply a strategy known as “defense-in-depth,” layering security mechanisms such that
the impact of a failure in any one mechanism is minimized. Organizations should not rely on “security by
obscurity.”
In a typical ICS this means a defense-in-depth strategy that includes:
 Developing security policies, procedures, training and educational material that applies specifically
to the ICS.
 Considering ICS security policies and procedures based on the Homeland Security Advisory System
Threat Level, deploying increasingly heightened security postures as the Threat Level increases.
 Addressing security throughout the lifecycle of the ICS from architecture design to procurement to
installation to maintenance to decommissioning.
 Implementing a network topology for the ICS that has multiple layers, with the most critical
communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer.
 Providing logical separation between the corporate and ICS networks (e.g., stateful inspection
firewall(s) between the networks, unidirectional gateways).
 Employing a DMZ network architecture (i.e., prevent direct traffic between the corporate and ICS
networks).
 Ensuring that critical components are redundant and are on redundant networks.
 Designing critical systems for graceful degradation (fault tolerant) to prevent catastrophic cascading
events.
 Disabling unused ports and services on ICS devices after testing to assure this will not impact ICS
operation.
 Restricting physical access to the ICS network and devices.
 Restricting ICS user privileges to only those that are required to perform each person’s job (i.e.,
establishing role-based access control and configuring each role based on the principle of least
privilege).
 Using separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the ICS network and the
corporate network (i.e., ICS network accounts do not use corporate network user accounts).

 Using modern technology, such as smart cards for Personal Identity Verification (PIV).
 Implementing security controls such as intrusion detection software, antivirus software and file
integrity checking software, where technically feasible, to prevent, deter, detect, and mitigate the
introduction, exposure, and propagation of malicious software to, within, and from the ICS.
 Applying security techniques such as encryption and/or cryptographic hashes to ICS data storage and
communications where determined appropriate.
 Expeditiously deploying security patches after testing all patches under field conditions on a test
system if possible, before installation on the ICS.
 Tracking and monitoring audit trails on critical areas of the ICS.
 Employing reliable and secure network protocols and services where feasible.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in cooperation with the public and private
sector ICS community, has developed specific guidance on the application of the security controls in
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations [22], to ICS.
While many controls in Appendix F of NIST SP 800-53 are applicable to ICS as written, many controls
require ICS-specific interpretation and/or augmentation by adding one or more of the following to the
control:





ICS Supplemental Guidance provides organizations with additional information on the
application of the security controls and control enhancements in Appendix F of NIST SP 80053 to ICS and the environments in which these specialized systems operate. The Supplemental
Guidance also provides information as to why a particular security control or control
enhancement may not be applicable in some ICS environments and may be a candidate for
tailoring (i.e., the application of scoping guidance and/or compensating controls). ICS
Supplemental Guidance does not replace the original Supplemental Guidance in Appendix F of
NIST SP 800-53.
ICS Enhancements (one or more) that provide enhancement augmentations to the original
control that may be required for some ICS.
ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance that provides guidance on how the control
enhancement applies, or does not apply, in ICS environments.

The most successful method for securing an ICS is to gather industry recommended practices and
engage in a proactive, collaborative effort between management, the controls engineer and operator, the
IT organization, and a trusted automation advisor. This team should draw upon the wealth of
information available from ongoing federal government, industry groups, vendor and standards
organizational activities listed in Appendix D—.

Purpose and Scope

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for
securing industrial control systems (ICS), including
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other
systems performing control functions. The document
provides a notional overview of ICS, reviews typical
system topologies and architectures, identifies known
threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and provides
recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the
associated risks. Additionally, it presents an ICS-tailored
security control overlay, based on NIST SP 800-53 Rev.
4 [22], to provide a customization of controls as they
apply to the unique characteristics of the ICS domain.
The body of the document provides context for the
overlay, but the overlay is intended to stand alone.
ICS are found in many industries such as electric, water
and wastewater, oil and natural gas, chemical,
pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and
discrete manufacturing (e.g., automotive, aerospace, and
durable goods). Because there are many different types of
ICS with varying levels of potential risk and impact, the
document provides a list of many different methods and
techniques for securing ICS. The document should not be
used purely as a checklist to secure a specific system.
Readers are encouraged to perform a risk-based
assessment on their systems and to tailor the
recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their
specific security, business and operational requirements.
The range of applicability of the basic concepts for
securing control systems presented in this document
continues to expand.
1.2

Audience

This document covers details specific to ICS. Readers of
this document should be acquainted with general
computer security concepts, and communication
protocols such as those used in networking. The
document is technical in nature; however, it provides the
necessary background to understand the topics that are
discussed.

Relationship to Executive
Order 13636 “Improving
Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity”
Recognizing that the national and
economic security of the United
States depends on the reliable
functionality of critical
infrastructure, the President under
the Executive Order “Improving
Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity” [82] directed NIST to
work with stakeholders to develop a
voluntary framework for reducing
cyber risks to critical infrastructure.
The Cybersecurity Framework
(CSF) [83] consists of standards,
guidelines, and best practices to
promote the protection of critical
infrastructure. The prioritized,
flexible, repeatable, performancebased, and cost-effective approach of
the Framework will help owners and
operators of critical infrastructure to
manage cybersecurity-related risk
while protecting business
confidentiality, individual privacy
and civil liberties. The initial CSF,
published in February 2014, resulted
in a national-level framework that is
flexible enough to apply across
multiple sectors and for different
operational environments. The CSF
was developed based on stakeholder
input to help ensure that existing
work within the various sectors can
be utilized within the Framework.
Industrial control system
cybersecurity standards, guidelines,
and practices can be leveraged to
address the CSF functions in the
context of an organization’s risk
management program.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Overview of Industrial Control Systems

Industrial control system (ICS) is a general term that encompasses several types of control systems,
including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS),
and other control system configurations such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) often found in
the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures. An ICS consists of combinations of control components
(e.g., electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to achieve an industrial objective
(e.g., manufacturing, transportation of matter or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with
producing the output is referred to as the process. The control part of the system includes the specification
of the desired output or performance. Control can be fully automated or may include a human in the loop.
Systems can be configured to operate open-loop, closed-loop, and manual mode. In open-loop control
systems the output is controlled by established settings. In closed-loop control systems, the output has an
effect on the input in such a way as to maintain the desired objective. In manual mode the system is
controlled completely by humans. The part of the system primarily concerned with maintaining
conformance with specifications is referred to as the controller (or control). A typical ICS may contain
numerous control loops, Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), and remote diagnostics and maintenance
tools built using an array of network protocols. ICS control industrial processes are typically used in
electrical, water and wastewater, oil and natural gas, chemical, transportation, pharmaceutical, pulp and
paper, food and beverage, and discrete manufacturing (e.g., automotive, aerospace, and durable goods)
industries.
ICS are critical to the operation of the U.S. critical infrastructures that are often highly interconnected and
mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that approximately 85 percent of the nation's critical
infrastructures are privately owned and operated1. Federal agencies also operate many of the industrial
processes mentioned above as well as air traffic control. This section provides an overview of SCADA,
DCS, and PLC systems, including typical topologies and components. Several diagrams are presented to
depict the network topology, connections, components, and protocols typically found on each system to
facilitate the understanding of these systems. These examples only attempt to identify notional topology
concepts. Actual implementations of ICS may be hybrids that blur the line between DCS and SCADA
systems. Note that the diagrams in this section do not focus on securing ICS. Security architecture and
security controls are discussed in Section 5 and Section 6 of this document respectively.
2.1

Evolution of Industrial Control Systems

Many of today’s ICS evolved from the insertion of IT capabilities into existing physical systems, often
replacing or supplementing physical control mechanisms. For example, embedded digital controls
replaced analog mechanical controls in rotating machines and engines. Improvements in cost-and
performance have encouraged this evolution, resulting in many of today’s “smart” technologies such as
the smart electric grid, smart transportation, smart buildings, and smart manufacturing. While this
increases the connectivity and criticality of these systems, it also creates a greater need for their
adaptability, resilience, safety, and security.
Engineering of ICS continues to evolve to provide new capabilities while maintaining the typical long
lifecycles of these systems. The introduction of IT capabilities into physical systems presents emergent
behavior that has security implications. Engineering models and analysis are evolving to address these
emergent properties including safety, security, privacy, and environmental impact interdependencies.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

ICS Industrial Sectors and Their Interdependencies

Control systems are used in many different industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, including
manufacturing, distribution, and transportation.
2.2.1

Manufacturing Industries

Manufacturing presents a large and diverse industrial sector with many different processes, which can be
categorized into process-based and discrete-based manufacturing.
The process-based manufacturing industries typically utilize two main processes [1]:
 Continuous Manufacturing Processes. These processes run continuously, often with transitions to
make different grades of a product. Typical continuous manufacturing processes include fuel or steam
flow in a power plant, petroleum in a refinery, and distillation in a chemical plant.
 Batch Manufacturing Processes. These processes have distinct processing steps, conducted on a
quantity of material. There is a distinct start and end step to a batch process with the possibility of
brief steady state operations during intermediate steps. Typical batch manufacturing processes include
food manufacturing.
The discrete-based manufacturing industries typically conduct a series of steps on a single device to
create the end product. Electronic and mechanical parts assembly and parts machining are typical
examples of this type of industry.
Both process-based and discrete-based industries utilize the same types of control systems, sensors, and
networks. Some facilities are a hybrid of discrete and process-based manufacturing.
2.2.2

Distribution Industries

ICS are used to control geographically dispersed assets, often scattered over thousands of square
kilometers, including distribution systems such as water distribution and wastewater collection systems,
agricultural irrigation systems, oil and natural gas pipelines, electrical power grids, and railway
transportation systems.
2.2.3

Differences between Manufacturing and Distribution ICS

While control systems used in manufacturing and distribution industries are very similar in operation,
they are different in some aspects. Manufacturing industries are usually located within a confined factory
or plant-centric area, when compared to geographically dispersed distribution industries. Communications
in manufacturing industries are usually performed using local area network (LAN) technologies that are
typically more reliable and high speed as compared to the long-distance communication wide-area
networks (WAN) and wireless/RF (radio frequency) technologies used by distribution industries. The ICS
used in distribution industries are designed to handle long-distance communication challenges such as
delays and data loss posed by the various communication media used. The security controls may differ
among network types.
2.2.4

ICS and Critical Infrastructure Interdependencies

The U.S. critical infrastructure is often referred to as a “system of systems” because of the
interdependencies that exist between its various industrial sectors as well as interconnections between
business partners [8] [9]. Critical infrastructures are highly interconnected and mutually dependent in

2-2

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

complex ways, both physically and through a host of information and communications technologies. An
incident in one infrastructure can directly and indirectly affect other infrastructures through cascading and
escalating failures.
Both the electrical power transmission and distribution grid industries use geographically distributed
SCADA control technology to operate highly interconnected and dynamic systems consisting of
thousands of public and private utilities and rural cooperatives for supplying electricity to end users.
Some SCADA systems monitor and control electricity distribution by collecting data from and issuing
commands to geographically remote field control stations from a centralized location. SCADA systems
are also used to monitor and control water, oil and natural gas distribution, including pipelines, ships,
trucks, and rail systems, as well as wastewater collection systems.
SCADA systems and DCS are often networked together. This is the case for electric power control
centers and electric power generation facilities. Although the electric power generation facility operation
is controlled by a DCS, the DCS must communicate with the SCADA system to coordinate production
output with transmission and distribution demands.
Electric power is often thought to be one of the most prevalent sources of disruptions of interdependent
critical infrastructures. As an example, a cascading failure can be initiated by a disruption of the
microwave communications network used for an electric power transmission SCADA system. The lack of
monitoring and control capabilities could cause a large generating unit to be taken offline, an event that
would lead to loss of power at a transmission substation. This loss could cause a major imbalance,
triggering a cascading failure across the power grid. This could result in large area blackouts that could
potentially affect oil and natural gas production, refinery operations, water treatment systems, wastewater
collection systems, and pipeline transport systems that rely on the grid for electric power.
2.3

ICS Operation and Components

The basic operation of an ICS is shown in Figure 2-1 [2]. Some critical processes may also include safety
systems. Key components include the following:
A typical ICS contains numerous control loops, human interfaces, and remote diagnostics and
maintenance tools built using an array of network protocols on layered network architectures. A control
loop utilizes sensors, actuators, and controllers (e.g., PLCs) to manipulate some controlled process. A
sensor is a device that produces a measurement of some physical property and then sends this information
as controlled variables to the controller. The controller interprets the signals and generates corresponding
manipulated variables, based on a control algorithm and target set points, which it transmits to the
actuators. Actuators such as control valves, breakers, switches, and motors are used to directly manipulate
the controlled process based on commands from the controller.
Operators and engineers use human interfaces to monitor and configure set points, control algorithms, and
to adjust and establish parameters in the controller. The human interface also displays process status
information and historical information. Diagnostics and maintenance utilities are used to prevent, identify,
and recover from abnormal operation or failures.
Sometimes these control loops are nested and/or cascading –whereby the set point for one loop is based
on the process variable determined by another loop. Supervisory-level loops and lower-level loops
operate continuously over the duration of a process with cycle times ranging on the order of milliseconds
to minutes.

To support subsequent discussions, this section defines key ICS components that are used in control and
networking. Some of these components can be described generically for use in SCADA systems, DCS
and PLCs, while others are unique to one. The Glossary of Terms in Appendix B— contains a more
detailed listing of control and networking components. Additionally, Figure 2-5 and Figure 2-6 show
SCADA implementation examples; Figure 2-7 shows a DCS implementation example and Figure 2-8
shows a PLC implementation example that incorporates these components.
2.3.1

ICS System Design Considerations

While Section 2.3 introduced the basic components of an ICS, the design of an ICS, including whether a
SCADA, DCS, or PLC-based topologies are used depends on many factors. This section identifies key
factors that drive design decisions regarding the control, communication, reliability, and redundancy
properties of the ICS. Because these factors heavily influence the design of the ICS, they will also help
determine the security needs of the system.
 Control Timing Requirements. ICS processes have a wide range of time-related requirements,
including very high speed, consistency, regularity, and synchronization. Humans may not be able to
reliably and consistently meet these requirements; automated controllers may be necessary. Some
systems may require the computation to be performed as close to the sensor and actuators as possible
to reduce communication latency and perform necessary control actions on time.

2-4

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Geographic Distribution. Systems have varying degrees of distribution, ranging from a small system
(e.g., local PLC-controlled process) to large, distributed systems (e.g., oil pipelines, electric power
grid). Greater distribution typically implies a need for wide area (e.g., leased lines, circuit switching,
and packet switching) and mobile communication.
 Hierarchy. Supervisory control is used to provide a central location that can aggregate data from
multiple locations to support control decisions based on the current state of the system. Often a
hierarchical/centralized control is used to provide human operators with a comprehensive view of the
entire system.
 Control Complexity. Often control functions can be performed by simple controllers and preset
algorithms. However, more complex systems (e.g., air traffic control) require human operators to
ensure that all control actions are appropriate to meet the larger objectives of the system.
 Availability. The system’s availability (i.e., reliability) requirements are also an important factor in
design. Systems with strong availability/up-time requirements may require more redundancy or
alternate implementations across all communication and control.
 Impact of Failures. The failure of a control function could incur substantially different impacts
across domains. Systems with greater impacts often require the ability to continue operations through
redundant controls, or the ability to operate in a degraded state. The design needs to address these
requirements.
 Safety. The system’s safety requirements area also an important factor in design. Systems must be
able to detect unsafe conditions and trigger actions to reduce unsafe conditions to safe ones. In most
safety-critical operations, human oversight and control of a potentially dangerous process is an
essential part of the safety system.
2.3.2

SCADA Systems

SCADA systems are used to control dispersed assets where centralized data acquisition is as important as
control [3] [4]. These systems are used in distribution systems such as water distribution and wastewater
collection systems, oil and natural gas pipelines, electrical utility transmission and distribution systems,
and rail and other public transportation systems. SCADA systems integrate data acquisition systems with
data transmission systems and HMI software to provide a centralized monitoring and control system for
numerous process inputs and outputs. SCADA systems are designed to collect field information, transfer
it to a central computer facility, and display the information to the operator graphically or textually,
thereby allowing the operator to monitor or control an entire system from a central location in near real
time. Based on the sophistication and setup of the individual system, control of any individual system,
operation, or task can be automatic, or it can be performed by operator commands.
Typical hardware includes a control server placed at a control center, communications equipment (e.g.,
radio, telephone line, cable, or satellite), and one or more geographically distributed field sites consisting
of Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and/or PLCs, which controls actuators and/or monitors sensors. The
control server stores and processes the information from RTU inputs and outputs, while the RTU or PLC
controls the local process. The communications hardware allows the transfer of information and data back
and forth between the control server and the RTUs or PLCs. The software is programmed to tell the
system what and when to monitor, what parameter ranges are acceptable, and what response to initiate
when parameters change outside acceptable values. An Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), such as a
protective relay, may communicate directly to the control server, or a local RTU may poll the IEDs to
collect the data and pass it to the control server. IEDs provide a direct interface to control and monitor
equipment and sensors. IEDs may be directly polled and controlled by the control server and in most
2-5

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

cases have local programming that allows for the IED to act without direct instructions from the control
center. SCADA systems are usually designed to be fault-tolerant systems with significant redundancy
built into the system. Redundancy may not be a sufficient countermeasure in the face of malicious attack.
Figure 2-2 shows the components and general configuration of a SCADA system. The control center
houses a control server and the communications routers. Other control center components include the
HMI, engineering workstations, and the data historian, which are all connected by a LAN. The control
center collects and logs information gathered by the field sites, displays information to the HMI, and may
generate actions based upon detected events. The control center is also responsible for centralized
alarming, trend analyses, and reporting. The field site performs local control of actuators and monitors
sensors (Note that sensors and actuators are only shown in Figure 2-5). Field sites are often equipped with
a remote access capability to allow operators to perform remote diagnostics and repairs usually over a
separate dial up modem or WAN connection. Standard and proprietary communication protocols running
over serial and network communications are used to transport information between the control center and
field sites using telemetry techniques such as telephone line, cable, fiber, and radio frequency such as
broadcast, microwave and satellite.
SCADA communication topologies vary among implementations. The various topologies used, including
point-to-point, series, series-star, and multi-drop [5], are shown in Figure 2-3.
Point-to-point is functionally the simplest type; however, it is expensive because of the individual
channels needed for each connection. In a series configuration, the number of channels used is reduced;
however, channel sharing has an impact on the efficiency and complexity of SCADA operations.
Similarly, the series-star and multi-drop configurations’ use of one channel per device results in decreased
efficiency and increased system complexity.

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

The four basic topologies Figure 2-3 can be further augmented using dedicated devices to manage
communication exchanges as well as message switching and buffering. Large SCADA systems
containing hundreds of RTUs often employee a sub-control server to alleviate the burden on the primary
server. This type of topology is shown in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-5 shows an example of a SCADA system implementation. This particular SCADA system
consists of a primary control center and three field sites. A second backup control center provides
redundancy in the event of a primary control center malfunction. Point-to-point connections are used for
all control center to field site communications, with two connections using radio telemetry. The third field
site is local to the control center and uses the WAN for communications. A regional control center resides
above the primary control center for a higher level of supervisory control. The corporate network has
access to all control centers through the WAN, and field sites can be accessed remotely for
troubleshooting and maintenance operations. The primary control center polls field devices for data at
defined intervals (e.g., 5 seconds, 60 seconds) and can send new set points to a field device as required. In
addition to polling and issuing high-level commands, the control server also watches for priority
interrupts coming from field site alarm systems.

Figure 2-6 shows an example implementation for rail monitoring and control. This example includes a rail
control center that houses the SCADA system and three sections of a rail system. The SCADA system
polls the rail sections for information such as the status of the trains, signal systems, traction
electrification systems, and ticket vending machines. This information is also fed to operator consoles at
the HMI station within the rail control center. The SCADA system also monitors operator inputs at the
rail control center and disperses high-level operator commands to the rail section components. In addition,
the SCADA system monitors conditions at the individual rail sections and issues commands based on
these conditions (e.g., stopping a train to prevent it from entering an area that has been determined to be
flooded or occupied by another train based on condition monitoring).

Distributed Control Systems

DCS are used to control production systems within the same geographic location for industries such as oil
refineries, water and wastewater treatment, electric power generation plants, chemical manufacturing
plants, automotive production, and pharmaceutical processing facilities. These systems are usually
process control or discrete part control systems.
DCS are integrated as a control architecture containing a supervisory level of control overseeing multiple,
integrated sub-systems that are responsible for controlling the details of a localized process. A DCS uses a
centralized supervisory control loop to mediate a group of localized controllers that share the overall tasks
of carrying out an entire production process [6]. Product and process control are usually achieved by
deploying feedback or feedforward control loops whereby key product and/or process conditions are
automatically maintained around a desired set point. To accomplish the desired product and/or process
tolerance around a specified set point, specific process controllers, or more capable PLCs, are employed
in the field and are tuned to provide the desired tolerance as well as the rate of self-correction during
process upsets. By modularizing the production system, a DCS reduces the impact of a single fault on the

2-10

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

overall system. In many modern systems, the DCS is interfaced with the corporate network to give
business operations a view of production.
An example implementation showing the components and general configuration of a DCS is depicted in
Figure 2-7. This DCS encompasses an entire facility from the bottom-level production processes up to the
corporate or enterprise layer. In this example, a supervisory controller (control server) communicates to
its subordinates via a control network. The supervisor sends set points to and requests data from the
distributed field controllers. The distributed controllers control their process actuators based on control
server commands and sensor feedback from process sensors.
Figure 2-7 gives examples of low-level controllers found on a DCS system. The field control devices
shown include a PLC, a process controller, a single loop controller, and a machine controller. The single
loop controller interfaces sensors and actuators using point-to-point wiring, while the other three field
devices incorporate fieldbus networks to interface with process sensors and actuators. Fieldbus networks
eliminate the need for point-to-point wiring between a controller and individual field sensors and
actuators. Additionally, a fieldbus allows greater functionality beyond control, including field device
diagnostics, and can accomplish control algorithms within the fieldbus, thereby avoiding signal routing
back to the PLC for every control operation. Standard industrial communication protocols designed by
industry groups such as Modbus and Fieldbus [7] are often used on control networks and fieldbus
networks.
In addition to the supervisory-level and field-level control loops, intermediate levels of control may also
exist. For example, in the case of a DCS controlling a discrete part manufacturing facility, there could be
an intermediate level supervisor for each cell within the plant. This supervisor would encompass a
manufacturing cell containing a machine controller that processes a part and a robot controller that
handles raw stock and final products. There could be several of these cells that manage field-level
controllers under the main DCS supervisory control loop.

Programmable Logic Controller Based Topologies

PLCs are used in both SCADA and DCS systems as the control components of an overall hierarchical
system to provide local management of processes through feedback control as described in the sections
above. In the case of SCADA systems, they may provide the same functionality of RTUs. When used in
DCS, PLCs are implemented as local controllers within a supervisory control scheme.
In addition to PLC usage in SCADA and DCS, PLCs are also implemented as the primary controller in
smaller control system configurations to provide operational control of discrete processes such as
automobile assembly lines and power plant soot blower controls These topologies differ from SCADA
and DCS in that they generally lack a central control server and HMI and, therefore, primarily provide
closed-loop control without direct human involvement. PLCs have a user-programmable memory for
storing instructions for the purpose of implementing specific functions such as I/O control, logic, timing,
counting, three mode proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, communication, arithmetic, and data
and file processing.

Comparing ICS and IT Systems Security

ICS control the physical world and IT systems manage data. ICS have many characteristics that differ
from traditional IT systems, including different risks and priorities. Some of these include significant risk
to the health and safety of human lives, serious damage to the environment, and financial issues such as
production losses, and negative impact to a nation’s economy. ICS have different performance and
reliability requirements, and also use operating systems and applications that may be considered
unconventional in a typical IT network environment. Security protections must be implemented in a way
that maintains system integrity during normal operations as well as during times of cyber attack [17].
Initially, ICS had little resemblance to IT systems in that ICS were isolated systems running proprietary
control protocols using specialized hardware and software. Widely available, low-cost Ethernet and
Internet Protocol (IP) devices are now replacing the older proprietary technologies, which increases the
possibility of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents. As ICS are adopting IT solutions to promote
corporate connectivity and remote access capabilities, and are being designed and implemented using
industry standard computers, operating systems (OS) and network protocols, they are starting to resemble
IT systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation for
ICS from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure these systems.
While security solutions have been designed to deal with these security issues in typical IT systems,
special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to ICS environments. In some
cases, new security solutions are needed that are tailored to the ICS environment.
The environments in which ICS and IT systems operate are constantly changing. The environments of
operation include, but are not limited to: the threat space; vulnerabilities; missions/business functions;
mission/business processes; enterprise and information security architectures; information technologies;
personnel; facilities; supply chain relationships; organizational governance/culture;
procurement/acquisition processes; organizational policies/procedures; organizational assumptions,
constraints, risk tolerance, and priorities/trade-offs).
The following lists some special considerations when considering security for ICS:
 Timeliness and Performance Requirements. ICS are generally time-critical, with the criterion for
acceptable levels of delay and jitter dictated by the individual installation. Some systems require
reliable, deterministic responses. High throughput is typically not essential to ICS. In contrast, IT
systems typically require high throughput, and they can typically withstand some level of delay and
jitter. For some ICS, automated response time or system response to human interaction is very
critical. Some ICS are built on real-time operating systems (RTOS), where real-time refers to
timeliness requirements. The units of real-time are very application dependent and must be explicitly
stated.
 Availability Requirements. Many ICS processes are continuous in nature. Unexpected outages of
systems that control industrial processes are not acceptable. Outages often must be planned and
scheduled days or weeks in advance. Exhaustive pre-deployment testing is essential to ensure high
availability (i.e., reliability) for the ICS. Control systems often cannot be easily stopped and started
without affecting production. In some cases, the products being produced or equipment being used is
more important than the information being relayed. Therefore, the use of typical IT strategies such as
rebooting a component, are usually not acceptable solutions due to the adverse impact on the
requirements for high availability, reliability and maintainability of the ICS. Some ICS employ
redundant components, often running in parallel, to provide continuity when primary components are
unavailable.

2-14

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Risk Management Requirements. In a typical IT system, data confidentiality and integrity are
typically the primary concerns. For an ICS, human safety and fault tolerance to prevent loss of life or
endangerment of public health or confidence, regulatory compliance, loss of equipment, loss of
intellectual property, or lost or damaged products are the primary concerns. The personnel responsible
for operating, securing, and maintaining ICS must understand the important link between safety and
security. Any security measure that impairs safety is unacceptable.
 Physical Effects. ICS field devices (e.g., PLC, operator station, DCS controller) are directly
responsible for controlling physical processes. ICS can have very complex interactions with physical
processes and consequences in the ICS domain that can manifest in physical events. Understanding
these potential physical effects often requires communication between experts in control systems and
in the particular physical domain.
 System Operation. ICS operating systems (OS) and control networks are often quite different from
IT counterparts, requiring different skill sets, experience, and levels of expertise. Control networks
are typically managed by control engineers, not IT personnel. Assumptions that differences are not
significant can have disastrous consequences on system operations.
 Resource Constraints. ICS and their real time OSs are often resource-constrained systems that do
not include typical contemporary IT security capabilities. Legacy systems are often lacking resources
common on modern IT systems. Many systems may not have desired features including encryption
capabilities, error logging, and password protection. Indiscriminate use of IT security practices in ICS
may cause availability and timing disruptions. There may not be computing resources available on
ICS components to retrofit these systems with current security capabilities. Adding resources or
features may not be possible.
 Communications. Communication protocols and media used by ICS environments for field device
control and intra-processor communication are typically different from most IT environments, and
may be proprietary.
 Change Management. Change management is paramount to maintaining the integrity of both IT and
control systems. Unpatched software represents one of the greatest vulnerabilities to a system.
Software updates on IT systems, including security patches, are typically applied in a timely fashion
based on appropriate security policy and procedures. In addition, these procedures are often
automated using server-based tools. Software updates on ICS cannot always be implemented on a
timely basis. These updates need to be thoroughly tested by both the vendor of the industrial control
application and the end user of the application before being implemented. Additionally, the ICS
owner must plan and schedule ICS outages days/weeks in advance. The ICS may also require
revalidation as part of the update process. Another issue is that many ICS utilize older versions of
operating systems that are no longer supported by the vendor. Consequently, available patches may
not be applicable. Change management is also applicable to hardware and firmware. The change
management process, when applied to ICS, requires careful assessment by ICS experts (e.g., control
engineers) working in conjunction with security and IT personnel.
 Managed Support. Typical IT systems allow for diversified support styles, perhaps supporting
disparate but interconnected technology architectures. For ICS, service support is sometimes via a
single vendor, which may not have a diversified and interoperable support solution from another
vendor. In some instances, third-party security solutions are not allowed due to ICS vendor license
and service agreements, and loss of service support can occur if third party applications are installed
without vendor acknowledgement or approval.

 Component Lifetime. Typical IT components have a lifetime on the order of 3 to 5 years, with
brevity due to the quick evolution of technology. For ICS where technology has been developed in
many cases for very specific use and implementation, the lifetime of the deployed technology is often
in the order of 10 to 15 years and sometimes longer.
 Component Location. Most IT components and some ICS are located in business and commercial
facilities physically accessible by local transportation. Remote locations may be utilized for backup
facilities. Distributed ICS components may be isolated, remote, and require extensive transportation
effort to reach. Component location also needs to consider necessary physical and environmental
security measures.

In summary, the operational and risk differences between ICS and IT systems create the need for
increased sophistication in applying cybersecurity and operational strategies. A cross-functional team of
control engineers, control system operators and IT security professionals needs to work closely to
understand the possible implications of the installation, operation, and maintenance of security solutions
in conjunction with control system operation. IT professionals working with ICS need to understand the
reliability impacts of information security technologies before deployment. Some of the OSs and
applications running on ICS may not operate correctly with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IT
cybersecurity solutions because of specialized ICS environment architectures.
2.5

Other Types of Control Systems

Although this guide provides guidance for securing ICS, other types of control systems share similar
characteristics and many of the recommendations from this guide are applicable and could be used as a
reference to protect such systems against cybersecurity threats. For example, although many building,
transportation, medical, security and logistics systems use different protocols, ports and services, and are
configured and operate in different modes than ICS, they share similar characteristics to traditional ICS
[18]. Examples of some of these systems and protocols include:

The security controls provided in Appendix G— of this guide are general and flexible enough be used to
evaluate other types of control systems, but subject matter experts should review the controls and tailor
them as appropriate to address the uniqueness of other types of control systems. There is no “one size fits
all,” and the risks may not be the same, even within a particular group. For example, a building has many
different sub-systems such as building automation, fire alarm, physical access control, digital signage,
CCTV, etc. Critical life safety systems such as the fire alarm and physical access control systems may
drive the impact level to be a “High,” while the other systems will usually be “Low.” An organization
might decide to evaluate each sub-system individually, or decide to use an aggregated approach. The
control systems evaluation should be coupled to the Business Impact, Contingency Plan, and Incident
Response Plan to ensure organizational critical functions and operations can be recovered and restored as
defined by the organizations Recovery Time Objectives.

ICS Risk Management and Assessment

3.1

Risk Management

Organizations manage risk every day in meeting their business objectives. These risks may include
financial risk, risk of equipment failure, and personnel safety risk, to name just a few. Organizations must
develop processes to evaluate the risks associated with their business and to decide how to deal with those
risks based on organizational priorities and both internal and external constraints. This management of
risk is conducted as an interactive, ongoing process as part of normal operations. Organizations that use
ICS have historically managed risk through good practices in safety and engineering. Safety assessments
are well established in most sectors and are often incorporated into regulatory requirements. Information
security risk management is an added dimension that can be complementary. The risk management
process and framework outlined in this section can be applied to any risk assessment including both safety
and information security.
A risk management process should be employed throughout an organization, using a three-tiered
approach to address risk at the (i) organization level; (ii) mission/business process level; and (iii)
information system level (IT and ICS). The risk management process is carried out seamlessly across the
three tiers with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the organization’s risk-related
activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier communication among all stakeholders having a shared
interest in the mission/business success of the organization.
This section focuses primarily on ICS considerations at the information system level, however, it is
important to note that the risk management activities, information, and artifacts at each tier impact and
inform the other tiers. Section 6 extends the concepts presented here to the control family level and
provides ICS-specific recommendations to augment security control families. Throughout the following
discussion of risk management, ICS considerations will be highlighted and the impact that these
considerations have on the risk management process will be discussed.
For more information on multi-tiered risk management and the risk management process, refer to NIST
Special Publication 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission and Information
System View [20]. NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management
Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach [21], provides guidelines for
applying the Risk Management Framework to federal information systems to include conducting the
activities of security categorization,4 security control selection and implementation, security control
assessment, information system authorization,5 and security control monitoring. NIST Special Publication
800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, provides a step-by-step process for organizations on: (i)
how to prepare for risk assessments; (ii) how to conduct risk assessments; (iii) how to communicate risk
assessment results to key organizational personnel; and (iv) how to maintain the risk assessments over
time [79].

4

FIPS 199 provides security categorization guidance for non-national security systems [15]. CNSS Instruction 1253 provides
similar guidance for national security systems.
5
Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official to authorize operation of an
information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.

Introduction to the Risk Management Process

As shown in Figure 3-1, the risk management process has four components: framing, assessing,
responding and monitoring. These activities are interdependent and often occur simultaneously within an
organization. For example, the results of the monitoring component will feed into the framing component.
As the environment in which organizations operate is always changing, risk management must be a
continuous process where all components have on-going activities. It is important to remember that these
components apply to the management of any risk whether information security, physical security, safety
or financial.

Figure 3-1. Risk Management Process Applied Across the Tiers

The framing component in the risk management process consists of developing a framework for the risk
management decisions to be made. The level of risk that an organization is willing to accept is its risk
tolerance [21, p.6].
The framing component should include review of existing documentation, such as prior risk assessments.
There may be related activities; such as community wide disaster management planning that also should
be considered since they impact the requirements that a risk assessment must consider.

3-2

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
For operators of ICS, safety is the major consideration that directly affects decisions on how systems
are engineered and operated. Safety can be defined as “freedom from conditions that can cause death,
injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the
environment.”6 Part of the framing component for an ICS organization is determining how these
requirements interact with information security. For example, if safety requirements conflict with good
security practice, how will the organization decide between the two priorities? Most ICS operators
would answer that safety is the main consideration – the framing component makes such assumptions
explicit so that there is agreement throughout the process and the organization.
Another major concern for ICS operators is the availability of services provided by the ICS. The ICS
may be part of critical infrastructure (for example, water or power systems), where there is a significant
need for continuous and reliable operations. As a result, ICS may have strict requirements for
availability or for recovery. Such assumptions should be developed and stated in the framing
component. Otherwise, the organization may make risk decisions that result in unintended
consequences on those who depend on the services provided.
The physical operating environment is another aspect of risk framing that organizations should
consider when working with ICS. ICS often have specific environmental requirements (e.g., a
manufacturing process may require precise temperature), or they may be tied to their physical
environment for operations. Such requirements and constraints should be explicitly stated in the
framing component so that the risks arising from these constraints can be identified and considered.

Assessing risk requires that organizations identify their threats and vulnerabilities, the harm that such
threats and vulnerabilities may cause the organization and the likelihood that adverse events arising from
those threats and vulnerabilities may actually occur.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
The DHS National Cybersecurity & Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)7 serves as a
centralized location where operational elements involved in cybersecurity and communications reliance
are coordinated and integrated. The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team
(ICS-CERT)8 collaborates with international and private sector Computer Emergency Response Teams
(CERTs) to share control systems-related security incidents and mitigation measures. ICS-CERT works
to reduce risks within and across all critical infrastructure sectors by partnering with law enforcement
agencies and the intelligence community and coordinating efforts among Federal, state, local, and tribal
governments and control systems owners, operators, and vendors.
When assessing the potential impact to an organization’s mission from a potential ICS incident, it is
important to incorporate the effect on the physical process/system, impact on dependent
systems/processes, and impact on the physical environment among other possibilities. In addition, the
potential impact on safety should always be considered.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

The responding component is based on the concept of a consistent organization-wide response to the
identification of risk. Response to identification of risk (as opposed to the response to an incident)
requires that organizations first identify possible courses of actions to address risk, evaluate those
possibilities in light of the organization’s risk tolerance and other considerations determined during the
framing step, and choose the best alternative for the organization. The response component includes the
implementation of the chosen course of action to address the identified risk: acceptance, avoidance,
mitigation, sharing, transfer, or any combination of those options9.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
For ICS, available risk responses may be constrained by system requirements, potential adverse impact
on operations, or even regulatory compliance regimes. An example of risk sharing is when utilities
enter into agreements to “loan” line workers in an emergency, which reduces the duration of the effect
of an incident to acceptable levels.

Monitoring is the fourth component of the risk management activities. Organizations must monitor risk
on an on-going basis including: the implementation of chosen risk management strategies; the changes in
the environment that may affect the risk calculation; and, the effectiveness and efficiency of risk
reduction activities. The activities in the monitoring component impact all the other components.
3.3

Special Considerations for Doing an ICS Risk Assessment

The nature of ICS means that when an organization does a risk assessment, there may be additional
considerations that do not exist when doing a risk assessment of a traditional IT system. Because the
impact of a cyber incident in an ICS may include both physical and digital effects, risk assessments need
to incorporate those potential effects. This section will provide a more in-depth examination of the
following:
 Impacts on safety and use of safety assessments.
 Physical impact of a cyber incident on an ICS, including the larger physical environment; effect on
the process controlled, and the physical effect on the ICS itself.
 The consequences for risk assessments of non-digital control components within an ICS.
3.3.1

Safety within an ICS Information Security Risk Assessment

The culture of safety and safety assessments is well established within the majority of the ICS user
community. Information security risk assessments should be seen as complementary to such assessments
though the assessments may use different approaches and cover different areas. Safety assessments are
concerned primarily with the physical world. Information security risk assessments primarily look at the
digital world. However, in an ICS environment, the physical and the digital are intertwined and
significant overlap may occur.
It is important that organizations consider all aspects of risk management for safety (e.g., risk framing,
risk tolerances), as well as the safety assessment results, when carrying out risk assessments for
information security. The personnel responsible for the information security risk assessment must be able
9

For additional information on accepting, avoiding, mitigating, sharing, or transferring risk, refer to NIST Special Publication
800-39 [20].

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

to identify and communicate identified risks that could have safety implications. Conversely, the
personnel charged with safety assessments must be familiar with the potential physical impacts and their
likelihood developed by the information security risk assessment process.
3.3.2

Potential Physical Impacts of an ICS Incident

Evaluating the potential physical damage from a cyber incident should incorporate: i) how an incident
could manipulate the operation of sensors and actuators to impact the physical environment; ii) what
redundant controls exist in the ICS to prevent an impact; and iii) how a physical incident could emerge
based on these conditions. A physical impact could negatively impact the surrounding world through
multiple means, including the release of hazardous materials (e.g., pollution, crude oil), damaging kinetic
forces (e.g., explosions), and exposure to energy sources (e.g., electricity, steam). The physical incident
could negatively impact the ICS and supporting infrastructure, the various processes performed by the
ICS, or the larger physical environment. An evaluation of the potential physical impacts should include
all parts of an ICS, beginning with evaluating the potential impacts on the set of sensor and actuators.
Each of these domains will be further explored below.
Evaluating the impact of a cyber incident on the physical environment should focus on potential damage
to human safety, the natural environment, and other critical infrastructures. Human safety impacts should
be evaluated based on whether injury, disease, or death is possible from a malfunction of the ICS. This
should incorporate any previously performed safety impact assessments performed by the organization
regarding both employees and the general public. Environmental impacts also may need to be addressed.
This analysis should incorporate any available environmental impact assessments performed by the
organization to determine how an incident could impact natural resources and wildlife over the short or
long term. In addition, it should be noted that ICS may not be located within a single, controlled location
and can be distributed over a wide physical area and exposed to uncontrolled environments. Finally, the
impact on the physical environment should explore the extent to which an incident could damage
infrastructures external to the ICS (e.g., electric generation/delivery, transportation infrastructures, and
water services).
3.3.3

Impact of Physical Disruption of an ICS Process

In addition to the impact on the physical environment, the risk assessment should also evaluate potential
effects to the physical process performed by the ICS under consideration, as well as other systems. An
incident that impacts the ICS and disrupts the dependent process may cause cascading impacts into other
related ICS processes and the general public’s dependence on the resulting products and services. Impact
to related ICS processes could include both systems and processes within the organization (e.g., a
manufacturing process that depends on the process controlled by the system under consideration) or
systems and processes external to the organization (e.g., a utility selling generated energy to a nearby
plant).
A cyber incident can also negatively impact the physical ICS under consideration. This type of impact
primarily includes the physical infrastructure of the plant (e.g., tanks, valves, motors), along with both the
digital and non-digital control mechanisms (e.g., cables, PLCs, pressure gauge). Damage to the ICS or
physical plant may cause either short or long term outages depending on the degree of the incident. An
example of a cyber incident impacting the ICS is the Stuxnet malware, which caused physical damage to
the centrifuges as well as disrupting dependent processes.

3.3.4

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Incorporating Non-digital Aspects of ICS into Impact Evaluations

The impacts on the ICS cannot be adequately determined by focusing only on the digital aspects of the
system, as there are often non-digital mechanisms available that provide fault tolerance and prevent the
ICS from acting outside of acceptable parameters. Therefore, these mechanisms may help reduce any
negative impact that a digital incident on the ICS might have and must be incorporated into the risk
assessment process. For example, ICS often have non-digital control mechanisms that can prevent the ICS
from operating outside of a safe boundary, and thereby limit the impact of an attack (e.g., a mechanical
relief pressure valve). In addition, analog mechanisms (e.g., meters, alarms) can be used to observe the
physical system state to provide operators with reliable data if digital readings are unavailable or
corrupted. Table 3-1 provides a categorization of non-digital control mechanisms that could be available
to reduce the impact of an ICS incident.
Table 3-1. Categories of Non-Digital ICS Control Components
System Type
Analog Displays or Alarms

Manual Control
Mechanisms

Analog Control Systems

Description
Non-digital mechanisms that measure and display the state of the physical
system (e.g., temperature, pressure, voltage, current) and can provide the
operator with accurate information in situations when digital displays are
unavailable or corrupted. The information may be provided to the operator on
some non-digital display (e.g., thermometers, pressure gauges) and through
audible alarms.
Manual control mechanisms (e.g., manual valve controls, physical breaker
switches) provide operators with the ability to manually control an actuator without
relying on the digital control system. This ensures that an actuator can be
controlled even if the control system is unavailable or compromised.
Analog control systems use non-digital sensors and actuators to monitor and
control a physical process. These may be able to prevent the physical process
from entering an undesired state in situations when the digital control system is
unavailable or corrupted. Analog controls include devices such as regulators,
governors, and electromechanical relays.

Determination of the potential impact that a cyber incident may have on the ICS should incorporate
analysis of all non-digital control mechanisms and the extent to which they can mitigate potential
negative impacts to the ICS. There are multiple considerations when considering the possible mitigation
effects of non-digital control mechanisms, such as:
 Non-digital control mechanisms may require additional time and human involvement to perform
necessary monitoring or control functions and these efforts may be substantial. For example, such
mechanisms may require operators to travel to a remote site to perform certain control functions.
Such mechanisms may also depend on human response times, which may be slower than automated
controls.
 Manual and analog systems may not provide monitoring or control capabilities with the same degree
of accuracy and reliability as the digital control system. This may present risk if the primary control
system is unavailable or corrupted due to reduced quality, safety, or efficiency of the system. For
example, a digital/numeric protection relay provides more accuracy and reliable detection of faults
than analog/static relays, therefore, the system maybe more likely to exhibit a spurious relay tripping
if the digital relays are not available.

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

3.3.5

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Incorporating the Impact of Safety Systems

Safety systems may also reduce the impact of a cyber incident to the ICS. Safety systems are often
deployed to perform specific monitoring and control functions to ensure the safety of people, the
environment, process, and ICS. While these systems are traditionally implemented to be fully redundant
with respect to the primary ICS, they may not provide complete redundancy from cyber incidents,
specifically from a sophisticated attacker. The impact of the implemented security controls on the safety
system should be evaluated to determine that they do not negatively impact the system.
3.3.6

Considering the Propagation of Impact to Connected Systems

Evaluating the impact of an incident must also incorporate how the impact from the ICS could propagate
to a connected ICS or physical system. An ICS may be interconnected with other systems, such that
failures in one system or process can easily cascade to other systems either within or external to the
organization. Impact propagation could occur due to both physical and logical dependencies. Proper
communication of the results of risk assessments to the operators of connected or interdependent systems
and processes is one way to mitigate such impacts.
Logical damage to an interconnected ICS could occur if the cyber incident propagated to the connected
control systems. An example could be if a virus or worm propagated to a connected ICS and then
impacted that system. Physical damage could also propagate to other interconnected ICS. If an incident
impacts the physical environment of an ICS, it may also impact other related physical domains. For
example, the impact could result in a physical hazard which degrades nearby physical environments.
Additionally, the impact could also degrade the common shared dependencies (e.g., power supply), or
result in a shortage of material needed for a later stage in an industrial process.

ICS Security Program Development and Deployment

Section 2 addresses critical operational differences between ICS and IT systems, and Section 3 addresses
risk management. This section combines these two concerns by addressing how organizations should
develop and deploy an ICS security program. ICS security plans and programs should be consistent and
integrated with existing IT security experience, programs, and practices, but must account for the specific
requirements and characteristics of ICS technologies and environments. Organizations should review and
update their ICS security plans and programs regularly to reflect changes in technologies, operations,
standards, and regulations, as well as the security needs of specific facilities.
This section provides an overview of the development and deployment of an ICS security program.
Section 4.1 describes how to establish a business case for an ICS security program, including suggested
content for the business case. Sections 4.2 through 4.5 discuss the development of a comprehensive ICS
security program and provide information on several major steps in deploying the program. Information
on specific security controls that might be implemented as part of the security program is provided in
Section 6.
Effectively integrating security into an ICS requires defining and executing a comprehensive program that
addresses all aspects of security, ranging from identifying objectives to day-to-day operation and ongoing
auditing for compliance and improvement. An ICS information security manager with appropriate scope,
responsibility, and authority must be identified. This section describes the basic process for developing a
security program, including the following:
 Develop a business case for security.
 Build and train a cross-functional team.
 Define charter and scope.
 Define specific ICS policies and procedures.
 Implement an ICS Security Risk Management Framework.
o

Define and inventory ICS assets.

o

Develop security plan for ICS Systems.

o

Perform a risk assessment.

o

Define the mitigation controls.

 Provide training and raise security awareness for ICS staff.
More detailed information on the various steps is provided in ISA-62443-2-1 Security for Industrial
Automation and Control Systems: Establishing an Industrial Automation and Control Systems Security
Program [34].
The commitment to a security program begins at the top. Senior management must demonstrate a clear
commitment to information security. Information security is a business responsibility shared by all
members of the enterprise and especially by leading members of the business, process, and management
teams. Information security programs with adequate funding and visible, top-level support from
organization leaders are more likely to achieve compliance, function more smoothly, and have greater
success than programs that lack that support.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Whenever a new system is being designed and installed, it is imperative to take the time to address
security throughout the lifecycle, from architecture to procurement to installation to maintenance to
decommissioning. There are serious risks in deploying systems to production based on the assumption
that they will be secured later. If there is insufficient time and resources to secure the system properly
before deployment, it is unlikely that there will be sufficient time and resources later to address security.
Designing and implementing a new system is quite rare. It is much more common to improve, expand, or
update an existing system. Everything in this section, indeed in this document, applies to managing the
risk of existing ICS. Building an ICS Security Program and applying it to existing systems is much more
complex and challenging.
4.1

Business Case for Security

The first step in implementing an information security program for ICS is to develop a compelling
business case for the unique needs of the organization. The business case should capture the business
concerns of senior management while being founded in the experience of those who are already dealing
with many of the same risks. The business case provides the business impact and financial justification
for creating an integrated information security program. It should include detailed information about the
following:
 Benefits, including improved control system reliability and availability, of creating an integrated
security program.
 Prioritized potential costs and damage scenarios if an information security program for the ICS is not
implemented.
 High-level overview of the process required to implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain, and
improve the information security program.
 Costs and resources required to develop, implement and maintain the security program.
Before presenting the business case to management, there should be a well-thought-out and developed
security implementation and cost plan. For example, simply requesting a firewall is insufficient.

Responsible risk management policy mandates that the threat to the ICS should be measured and
monitored to protect the interests of employees, the public, shareholders, customers, vendors, society, and
the nation. Risk analysis enables costs and benefits to be weighed so that informed decisions can be made
on protective actions. In addition to reducing risks, exercising due-diligence and displaying responsibility
also helps organizations by:
 Improving control system safety, reliability and availability.
 Improving employee morale, loyalty, and retention.
 Reducing community concerns.
 Increasing investor confidence.
 Reducing legal liabilities.
 Meeting regulatory requirements.
 Enhancing the corporate image and reputation.
 Helping with insurance coverage and cost.
 Improving investor and banking relations.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

A strong safety and information security management program is fundamental to a sustainable business
model.
Improved control systems security and control system specific security policies can potentially enhance
control system reliability and availability. This also includes minimizing unintentional control system
information security impacts from inappropriate testing, policies, and misconfigured systems.
4.1.2

Potential Consequences

The importance of secure systems should be further emphasized as business reliance on interconnectivity
increases. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and malware (e.g., worms, viruses) have become all too
common and have already impacted ICS. Cyber attacks can have significant physical and consequential
impacts. Risk management is addressed in Section 3. The major categories of impacts are as follows:
 Physical Impacts. Physical impacts encompass the set of direct consequences of ICS failure. The
potential effects of paramount importance include personal injury and loss of life. Other effects
include the loss of property (including data) and potential damage to the environment.
 Economic Impacts. Economic impacts are a second-order effect from physical impacts ensuing from
an ICS incident. Physical impacts could result in repercussions to system operations, which in turn
inflict a greater economic loss on the facility, organization, or others dependent on the ICS.
Unavailability of critical infrastructure (e.g., electrical power, transportation) can have economic
impact far beyond the systems sustaining direct and physical damage These effects could negatively
impact the local, regional, national, or possibly global economy.
 Social Impacts. Another second-order effect, the consequence from the loss of national or public
confidence in an organization, is many times overlooked. It is, however, a very real consequence that
could result from an ICS incident.
The program to control such risks is addressed in Section 3. Note that items in this list are not
independent. In fact, one can lead to another. For example, release of hazardous material can lead to
injury or death. Examples of potential consequences of an ICS incident are listed below:
 Impact on national security—facilitate an act of terrorism.
 Reduction or loss of production at one site or multiple sites simultaneously.
 Injury or death of employees.
 Injury or death of persons in the community.
 Damage to equipment.
 Release, diversion, or theft of hazardous materials.
 Environmental damage.
 Violation of regulatory requirements.
 Product contamination.
 Criminal or civil legal liabilities.
 Loss of proprietary or confidential information.
 Loss of brand image or customer confidence.
Undesirable incidents of any sort detract from the value of an organization, but safety and security
incidents can have longer-term negative impacts than other types of incidents on all stakeholders—
employees, shareholders, customers, and the communities in which an organization operates.
The list of potential business consequences needs to be prioritized to focus on the particular business
consequences that senior management will find the most compelling. The highest priority items shown in

4-3

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

the list of prioritized business consequences should be evaluated to obtain an estimate of the annual
business impact, preferably but not necessarily in financial terms.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires corporate leaders to sign off on compliance with information accuracy
and protection of corporate information.10 Also, the demonstration of due diligence is required by most
internal and external audit firms to satisfy shareholders and other organization stakeholders. By
implementing a comprehensive information security program, management is exercising due diligence.
4.1.3

Resources for Building Business Case

Significant resources for information to help form a business case can be found in external resources in
other organizations in similar lines of business–either individually or in information sharing exchanges,
trade and standards organizations, consulting firms–and internal resources in related risk management
programs or engineering and operations. External organizations can often provide useful tips as to what
factors most strongly influenced management to support their efforts and what resources within their
organizations proved most helpful. For different industries, these factors may be different, but there may
be similarities in the roles that other risk management specialists can play. Appendix D— provides a list
and short description of some of the current activities in ICS security.
Internal resources in related risk management efforts (e.g., information security, health, safety and
environmental risk, physical security, business continuity) can provide tremendous assistance based on
their experience with related incidents in the organization. This information is helpful from the standpoint
of prioritizing threats and estimating business impact. These resources can also provide insight into which
managers are focused on dealing with which risks and, thus, which managers might be the most
appropriate or receptive to serving as a champion. Internal resources in control systems engineering and
operations can provide insight into the details of how control systems are deployed within the
organization, such as the following:
 How networks are typically partitioned and segregated.
 What remote access connections are generally employed.
 How high-risk control systems or safety instrumented systems are typically designed.
 What security countermeasures are commonly used.
4.1.4

Presenting the Business Case to Leadership

Section 3 describes a three-tiered approach that addresses risk at the: (i) organization level; (ii)
mission/business process level; and (iii) information system level. The risk management process is carried
out seamlessly across the three tiers with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the
organization’s risk-related activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier communication among all
stakeholders having a shared interest in the mission/business success of the organization.
It is critical for the success of the ICS security program that organization level management buy into and
participate in the ICS security program. Tier 1 organization level management that encompasses both IT
and ICS operations has the perspective and authority to understand and take responsibility for the risks.
The Tier 1 business leadership will be responsible for approving and driving information security
policies, assigning security roles and responsibilities, and implementing the information security program
across the organization. Funding for the entire program can usually be done in phases. While some

4-4

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

funding may be required to start the information security activity, additional funding can be obtained later
as the security vulnerabilities and needs of the program are better understood and additional strategies are
developed. Additionally, the costs (both direct and indirect) should be considered for retrofitting the ICS
for security vs. addressing security to begin with.
Often, a good approach to obtain management buy-in to address the problem is to ground the business
case in a successful actual third-party example. The business case should present to management that the
other organization had the same problem and then present that they found a solution and how they solved
it. This will often prompt management to ask what the solution is and how it might be applicable to their
organization.
4.2

Build and Train a Cross-Functional Team

It is essential for a cross-functional information security team to share their varied domain knowledge and
experience to evaluate and mitigate risk in the ICS. At a minimum, the information security team should
consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, a control engineer, a control system operator, security
subject matter experts, and a member of the enterprise risk management staff. Security knowledge and
skills should include network architecture and design, security processes and practices, and secure
infrastructure design and operation. Contemporary thinking that both safety and security are emergent
properties of connected systems with digital control suggests including a safety expert. For continuity and
completeness, the information security team should also include the control system vendor and/or system
integrator.
The information security team should report directly to the information security manager at the
mission/business process or organization tier, who in turn reports to the mission/business process
manager (e.g., facility superintendent) or enterprise information security manager (e.g., the company’s
CIO/CSO), respectively. Ultimate authority and responsibility rests in the Tier 1 risk executive function
that provides a comprehensive, organization-wide approach to risk management. The risk executive
function works with the top management to accept a level of residual risk and accountability for the
information security of the ICS. Management level accountability will help ensure an ongoing
commitment to information security efforts.
While the control engineers will play a large role in securing the ICS, they will not be able to do so
without collaboration and support from both the IT department and management. IT often has years of
security experience, much of which is applicable to ICS. As the cultures of control engineering and IT are
often significantly different, their integration will be essential for the development of a collaborative
security design and operation.
4.3

Define Charter and Scope

The information security manager should establish policy that defines the guiding charter of the
information security organization and the roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of system owners,
mission/business process managers, and users. The information security manager should decide upon and
document the objective of the security program, the business organizations affected, all the computer
systems and networks involved, the budget and resources required, and the division of responsibilities.
The scope can also address business, training, audit, legal, and regulatory requirements, as well as
timetables and responsibilities. The guiding charter of the information security organization is a
constituent of the information security architecture which is part of the enterprise architecture, as
discussed in Section 3.

4-5

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

There may already be an information security program in place or being developed for the organization’s
IT business systems. The ICS information security manager should identify which existing practices to
leverage and which practices are specific to the control system. In the long run, it will be easier to get
positive results if the team can share resources with others in the organization that have similar objectives.
4.4

Define ICS-specific Security Policies and Procedures

Policies and procedures are at the root of every successful security program. Wherever possible, ICSspecific security policies and procedures should be integrated with existing operational/management
policies and procedures. Policies and procedures help to ensure that security protection is both consistent
and current to protect against evolving threats. Appendix C cites a lack of security policy as an important
vulnerability. Appendix G—, the ICS overlay, contains many ICS information security policy
recommendations. After an information security risk analysis has been performed, the information
security manager should examine existing security policies to see if they adequately address the risks to
the ICS. If needed, existing policies should be revised or new policies created.
As discussed in Section 3, Tier 1 management is responsible for developing and communicating the risk
tolerance of the organization–the level of risk the organization is willing to accept–which allows the
information security manager to determine the level of risk mitigation that should be taken to reduce
residual risk to acceptable levels. The development of the security policies should be based on a risk
assessment that will set the security priorities and goals for the organization so that the risks posed by the
threats are mitigated sufficiently. Procedures that support the policies need to be developed so that the
policies are implemented fully and properly for the ICS. Security procedures should be documented,
tested, and updated periodically in response to policy, technology, and threat changes.
4.5

Implement an ICS Security Risk Management Framework

From an abstract viewpoint, the management of ICS risks is another risk added to the list of risks
confronting an organization (e.g., financial, safety, IT, environmental). In each case, managers with
responsibility for the mission or business process establish and conduct a risk management program in
coordination with top management’s risk executive function. NIST Special Publication 800-39, Managing
Information Security Risk–Organization, Mission, and Information System View [20], is the foundation of
such a risk management program. Just like the other mission/business process areas, the personnel
concerned with ICS apply their specialized subject matter knowledge to establishing and conducting ICS
security risk management and to communicating with enterprise management to support effective risk
management across all the enterprise. NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk
Management Framework to Federal Information Systems [21], introduces the risk management
framework which addresses the process of implementing the framework. The following sections
summarize this process and apply the RMF to an ICS environment.
The RMF process includes a set of well-defined risk-related tasks that are to be carried out by selected
individuals or groups within well-defined organizational roles (e.g., risk executive [function], authorizing
official, authorizing official designated representative, chief information officer, senior information
security officer, enterprise architect, information security architect, information owner/steward,
information system owner, common control provider, information system security officer, and security
control assessor). Many risk management roles have counterpart roles defined in the routine system
development life cycle processes. RMF tasks are executed concurrently with or as part of system
development life cycle processes, taking into account appropriate dependencies.

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Organizations may also wish to consult ISA-62443-2-1, Security for Industrial Automation and Control
Systems: Establishing an Industrial Automation and Control Systems Security Program, which describes
another view of the elements contained in a cybersecurity management system for use in the industrial
automation and control systems environment [34]. It provides guidance on how to meet the requirements
described for each element. Sections 4 through 6 correspond most closely to NIST SP 800-39; other
sections correspond to other NIST Special Publications and to the ICS overlay in Appendix G— of this
document. All of these guidance documents recognize that one size does not fit all; rather, domain
knowledge should be applied in tailoring or adapting the guidance to the specific organization.
4.5.1

Categorize ICS Systems and Networks Assets

The information security team should define, inventory, and categorize the applications and computer
systems within the ICS, as well as the networks within and interfacing to the ICS. The focus should be on
systems rather than just devices, and should include PLCs, DCS, SCADA, and instrument-based systems
that use a monitoring device such as an HMI. Assets that use a routable protocol or are dial-up accessible
should be documented. The team should review and update the ICS asset list annually and after each asset
addition or removal.
There are several commercial enterprise IT inventory tools that can identify and document all hardware
and software resident on a network. Care must be taken before using these tools to identify ICS assets;
teams should first conduct an assessment of how these tools work and what impact they might have on
the connected control equipment. Tool evaluation may include testing in similar, non-production control
system environments to ensure that the tools do not adversely impact the production systems. Impact
could be due to the nature of the information or the volume of network traffic. While this impact may be
acceptable in IT systems, it may not be acceptable in an ICS.
An automated management system for inventory (e.g., Computerized Maintenance Management System
(CMMS), Computer Aided Facility Management System (CAFM), Building Information Model (BIM),
Geospatial Information System (GIS), Construction-Operations Building information exchange data
(COBie, Building Automation Management information exchange (BAMie), Sustainment Management
Systems (SMS) Builder) allows an organization to keep an accurate account of what is on the system for
security reasons and budgetary reasons as well.
4.5.2

Select ICS Security Controls

The security controls selected based on the security categorization of the ICS are documented in the
security plan to provide an overview of the security requirements for the ICS information security
program and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The
development of security plans is addressed in NIST Special Publication 800-18 Revision 1, Guide for
Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems [19]. The security plan can be one document,
or it can be the set of all documents addressing the security concerns for a system and the plans for
countering these concerns. In addition to security controls, NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4,
Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations [20], provides a set of
information security program management (PM) controls that are typically implemented at the
organization level and not directed at individual organizational information systems. This section
addresses how an organization establishes and carries out these program management controls.
The successful implementation of security controls for organizational information systems depends on the
successful implementation of organization-wide program management controls. The manner in which
organizations implement the program management controls depends on specific organizational
characteristics including, for example, the size, complexity, and mission/business requirements of the

4-7

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

respective organizations. The program management controls complement the security controls and focus
on the programmatic, organization-wide information security requirements that are independent of any
particular information system and are essential for managing information security programs.
Organizations document program management controls in the information security program plan. The
organization-wide information security program plan supplements the individual security plans developed
for each organizational information system. Together, the security plans for the individual information
systems and the information security program cover the totality of security controls employed by the
organization.
4.5.3

Perform Risk Assessment

Because every organization has a limited set of resources, organizations should assess the impacts to
organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation (e.g., using FIPS 199 [15] or a more granular approach).
As discussed in Section 3, organizations can experience the consequences/impact of adverse events at the
individual ICS system level (e.g., failing to perform as required), at the mission/business process level
(e.g., failing to fully meet mission/business objectives), and at the organizational level (e.g., failing to
comply with legal or regulatory requirements, damaging reputation or relationships, or undermining longterm viability). An adverse event can have multiple consequences and different types of impact, at
different levels, and in different time frames. NIST SP 800-53 [22] and the ICS overlay in Appendix G—
incorporate baseline security controls that derive from this determination of impact.
The organization may perform a detailed risk assessment for the highest impact systems and assessments
for lower impact systems as deemed prudent and as resources allow. The risk assessment will help
identify any weaknesses that contribute to information security risks and mitigation approaches to reduce
the risks. Risk assessments are conducted multiple times during a system’s life cycle. The focus and level
of detail varies according to the system’s maturity.
4.5.4

Implement the Security Controls

Organizations should analyze the detailed risk assessment and the impacts to organizational operations
(i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation, and prioritize selection of mitigation controls. Organizations should focus on mitigating
risk with the greatest potential impact. Security control implementation is consistent with the
organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.
The controls to mitigate a specific risk may vary among types of systems. For example, user
authentication controls might be different for ICS than for corporate payroll systems and e-commerce
systems. The ICS information security manager should document and communicate the selected controls,
along with the procedures for using the controls. Some risks may be identified that can be mitigated by
“quick fix” solutions—low-cost, high-value practices that can significantly reduce risk. Examples of these
solutions are restricting Internet access and eliminating email access on operator control stations or
consoles. Organizations should identify, evaluate, and implement suitable quick fix solutions as soon as
possible to reduce security risks and achieve rapid benefits. The Department of Energy (DOE) has a “21
Steps to Improve Cyber Security of SCADA Networks” [33] document that could be used as a starting
point to outline specific actions to increase the security of SCADA systems and other ICS.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

ICS Security Architecture

When designing a network architecture for an ICS deployment, it is usually recommended to separate the
ICS network from the corporate network. The nature of network traffic on these two networks is different:
Internet access, FTP, email, and remote access will typically be permitted on the corporate network but
should not be allowed on the ICS network. Rigorous change control procedures for network equipment,
configuration, and software changes may not be in place on the corporate network. If ICS network traffic
is carried on the corporate network, it could be intercepted or be subjected to DoS or Man-in-the-Middle
attacks [5.14]. By having separate networks, security and performance problems on the corporate network
should not be able to affect the ICS network.
Practical considerations, such as cost of ICS installation or maintaining a homogenous network
infrastructure, often mean that a connection is required between the ICS and corporate networks. This
connection is a significant security risk and should be protected by boundary protection devices. If the
networks must be connected, it is strongly recommended that only minimal (single if possible)
connections be allowed and that the connection is through a firewall and a DMZ. A DMZ is a separate
network segment that connects directly to the firewall. Servers containing the data from the ICS that
needs to be accessed from the corporate network are put on this network segment. Only these systems
should be accessible from the corporate network. With any external connections, the minimum access
should be permitted through the firewall, including opening only the ports required for specific
communication. The following sections elaborate on these architectural considerations. The ICS-CERT
recommended practices working group provides additional guidance as recommended practices11.
5.1

Network Segmentation and Segregation

This section addresses partitioning the ICS into security domains and separating the ICS from other
networks, such as the corporate network, and presents illustrative security architecture. Operational risk
analysis should be performed to determine critical parts of each ICS network and operation and help
define what parts of the ICS need to be segmented. Network segmentation involves partitioning the
network into smaller networks. For example, one large ICS network is partitioned into multiple ICS
networks, where the partitioning is based on factors such as management authority, uniform policy and
level of trust, functional criticality, and amount of communications traffic that crosses the domain
boundary. Network segmentation and segregation is one of the most effective architectural concepts
that an organization can implement to protect its ICS. Segmentation establishes security domains, or
enclaves, that are typically defined as being managed by the same authority, enforcing the same policy,
and having a uniform level of trust. Segmentation can minimize the method and level of access to
sensitive information, ICS communication and equipment configuration, and can make it significantly
more difficult for a malicious cyber adversary and can contain the effects of non-malicious errors and
accidents. A practical consideration in defining a security domain is the amount of communications
traffic that crosses the domain boundary, because domain protection typically involves examining
boundary traffic and determining whether it is permitted.
The aim of network segmentation and segregation is to minimize access to sensitive information for
those systems and people who don’t need it, while ensuring that the organization can continue to
operate effectively. This can be achieved using a number of techniques and technologies depending
on the network’s architecture and configuration.

11

ICS-CERT recommended practices may be found at http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Recommended-Practices.

5-1

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Traditionally, network segmentation and segregation is implemented at the gateway between domains.
ICS environments often have multiple well-defined domains, such as operational LANs, control LANs,
and operational DMZs, as well as gateways to non-ICS and less trustworthy domains such as the Internet
and the corporate LANs. When insider attacks, social engineering, mobile devices, and other
vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions discussed in Appendix C— are considered, protecting domain
gateways is prudent and worth considering.
Network segregation involves developing and enforcing a ruleset controlling which communications are
permitted through the boundary. Rules typically are based on source and destination identity and the type
or content of the data being transferred.
When implementing network segmentation and segregation correctly you are minimizing the method
and level of access to sensitive information. This can be achieved using a variety of technologies and
methods. Depending on the architecture and configuration of your network, some of the common
technologies and methods used include:
 Logical network separation enforced by encryption or network device-enforced partitioning.
o Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANS).
o Encrypted Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) use cryptographic mechanisms to separate
traffic combined on one network.
o Unidirectional gateways restrict communications between connections to a single direction,
therefore, segmenting the network.
 Physical network separation to completely prevent any interconnectivity of traffic between domains.
 Network traffic filtering which can utilize a variety of technologies at various network layers to
enforce security requirements and domains.
o Network layer filtering that restricts which systems are able to communicate with others on
the network based on IP and route information.
o State‐based filtering that restricts which systems are able to communicate with others on the
network based on their intended function or current state of operation.
o Port and/or protocol level filtering that restricts the number and type of services that each
system can use to communicate with others on the network.
o Application filtering that commonly filters the content of communications between systems
at the application layer. This includes application-level firewalls, proxies, and content-based
filter.
Some vendors are making products to filter ICS protocols at the application level which they market as
ICS firewalls.
Regardless of the technology chosen to implement network segmentation and segregation, there are four
common themes that implement the concept of defense-in-depth by providing for good network
segmentation and segregation:
 Apply technologies at more than just the network layer. Each system and network should be
segmented and segregated, where possible, from the data link layer up to and including the
application layer.
 Use the principles of least privilege and need‐to‐know. If a system doesn’t need to communicate
with another system, it should not be allowed to. If a system needs to talk only to another system on
a specific port or protocol and nothing else–or it needs to transfer a limited set of labeled or fixedformat data, it should be restricted as such.

5-2

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Separate information and infrastructure based on security requirements. This may include using
different hardware or platforms based on different threat and risk environments in which each
system or network segment operates. The most critical components require more strict isolation from
other components. In addition to network separation, the use of virtualization could be employed to
accomplish the required isolation.
 Implement whitelisting12 instead of blacklisting; that is, grant access to the known good, rather
than denying access to the known bad. The set of applications that run in ICS is essentially static,
making whitelisting more practical. This will also improve an organization’s capacity to analyze log
files.
5.2

Boundary Protection

Boundary protection devices control the flow of information between interconnected security domains to
protect the ICS against malicious cyber adversaries and non-malicious errors and accidents. Transferring
information between systems representing different security domains with different security policies
introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. Boundary protection
devices are key components of specific architectural solutions that enforce specific security policies.
Organizations can isolate ICS and business system components performing different missions and/or
business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among system components and
also provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected components. Separating
system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection
of individual components and more effective control of information flows between those components.
Boundary protection controls include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code
analysis and virtualization systems, intrusion detection systems (networked and host-based), encrypted
tunnels, managed interfaces, mail gateways, and unidirectional gateways (e.g., data diodes). Boundary
protection devices determine whether data transfer is permitted, often by examining the data or associated
metadata.
Network and ICS security architects must decide which domains are to be permitted direct
communication, the policies governing permitted communication, the devices to be used to enforce the
policy, and the topology for provisioning and implementing these decisions, which are typically based on
the trust relationship between domains. Trust involves the degree of control that the organization has over
the external domain (e.g., another domain in the same organization, a contracted service provider, the
Internet).
Boundary protection devices are arranged in accordance with organizational security architecture. A
common architectural construct is the demilitarized zones (DMZ), a host or network segment inserted as a
“neutral zone” between security domains. Its purpose is to enforce the ICS domain’s information security
policy for external information exchange and to provide external domains with restricted access while
shielding the ICS domain from outside threats.
Additional architectural considerations and functions that can be performed by boundary protection
devices for inter-domain communications include:

12

A whitelist is a list or register of those that are being provided a particular privilege, service, mobility, access or recognition.
Only those on the list will be accepted, approved or recognized (i.e., permitted). Whitelisting is the reverse of blacklisting,
the practice of identifying those that are denied, unrecognized, or ostracized (i.e., prohibited).

5-3

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Denying communications traffic by default and allowing communications traffic by exception (i.e.,
deny all, permit by exception). A deny-all, permit-by-exception communications traffic policy
ensures that only those connections which are approved are allowed. This is known as a white-listing
policy.
 Implementing proxy servers that act as an intermediary for external domains’ requesting information
system resources (e.g., files, connections, or services) from the ICS domain. External requests
established through an initial connection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and
to provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity.
 Preventing the unauthorized exfiltration of information. Techniques include, for example, deep packet
inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These devices verify adherence to protocol formats and
specification at the application layer and serve to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by
devices operating at the network or transport layers. The limited number of formats, especially the
prohibition of free form text in email, eases the use of such techniques at ICS boundaries.
 Only allowing communication between authorized and authenticated source and destinations address
pairs by one or more of the organization, system, application, and individual.
 Extending the DMZ concept to other separate subnetworks is useful, for example, in isolating ICS to
prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of organizations.
 Enforcing physical access control to limit authorized access to ICS components.
 Concealing network addresses of ICS components from discovery (e.g., network address not
published or entered in domain name systems), requiring prior knowledge for access.
 Disabling control and troubleshooting services and protocols, especially those employing broadcast
messaging, which can facilitate network exploration.
 Configuring boundary protection devices to fail in a predetermined state. Preferred failure states for
ICS involve balancing multiple factors including safety and security.
 Configuring security domains with separate network addresses (i.e., as disjoint subnets).
 Disabling feedback (e.g., non-verbose mode) to senders when there is a failure in protocol validation
format to prevent adversaries from obtaining information.
 Implementing one-way data flow, especially between different security domains.
 Establishing passive monitoring of ICS networks to actively detect anomalous communications and
provide alerts.
5.3

Firewalls

Network firewalls are devices or systems that control the flow of network traffic between networks
employing differing security postures. In most modern applications, firewalls and firewall environments
are discussed in the context of Internet connectivity and the UDP/IP protocol suite. However, firewalls
have applicability in network environments that do not include or require Internet connectivity. For
example, many corporate networks employ firewalls to restrict connectivity to and from internal networks
servicing more sensitive functions, such as the accounting or human resource departments. Firewalls can
5-4

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

further restrict ICS inter-subnetwork communications between functional security subnets and devices.
By employing firewalls to control connectivity to these areas, an organization can prevent unauthorized
access to the respective systems and resources within the more sensitive areas. There are three general
classes of firewalls:
 Packet Filtering Firewalls. The most basic type of firewall is called a packet filter. Packet filter
firewalls are essentially routing devices that include access control functionality for system addresses
and communication sessions. The access control is governed by a set of directives collectively
referred to as a rule set. In their most basic form, packet filters operate at layer 3 (network) of the
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), ISO/IEC 7498 model. This type of firewall checks basic
information in each packet, such as IP addresses, against a set of criteria before forwarding the
packet. Depending on the packet and the criteria, the firewall can drop the packet, forward it, or send
a message to the originator. This type of firewall can offer a high level of security, but could result in
overhead and delay impacts on network performance.
 Stateful Inspection Firewalls. Stateful inspection firewalls are packet filters that incorporate added
awareness of the OSI model data at layer 4 (transport). Stateful inspection firewalls filter packets at
the network layer, determine whether session packets are legitimate, and evaluate the contents of
packets at the transport layer (e.g., TCP, UDP) as well. Stateful inspection keeps track of active
sessions and uses that information to determine if packets should be forwarded or blocked. It offers a
high level of security and good performance, but it may be more expensive and complex to
administer. Additional rule sets for ICS applications may be required.
 Application-Proxy Gateway Firewalls. This class of firewalls examines packets at the application
layer and filters traffic based on specific application rules, such as specified applications (e.g.,
browsers) or protocols (e.g., FTP). Firewalls of this type can be very effective in preventing attacks
on the remote access and configuration services provided by ICS components. They offer a high level
of security, but could have overhead and delay impacts on network performance, which can be
unacceptable in an ICS environment. NIST SP 800-41 Revision 1, Guidelines on Firewalls and
Firewall Policy [85], provides general guidance for the selection of firewalls and the firewall policies.
In an ICS environment, firewalls are most often deployed between the ICS network and the corporate
network [34]. Properly configured, they can greatly restrict undesired access to and from control system
host computers and controllers, thereby improving security. They can also potentially improve a control
network’s responsiveness by removing non-essential traffic from the network. When properly designed,
configured, and maintained, dedicated hardware firewalls can contribute significantly to increasing the
security of today’s ICS environments.
Firewalls provide several tools to enforce a security policy that cannot be accomplished locally on the
current set of process control devices available in the market, including the ability to:
 Block all communications with the exception of specifically enabled communications between
devices on the unprotected LAN and protected ICS networks. Blocking can be based on, for example,
source and destination IP address pairs, services, ports, state of the connection, and specified
applications or protocols supported by the firewall. Blocking can occur on both inbound and
outbound packets, which is helpful in limiting high-risk communications such as email.
 Enforce secure authentication of all users seeking to gain access to the ICS network. There is
flexibility to employ varying protection levels of authentication methods including simple passwords,
complex passwords, multi-factor authentication technologies, tokens, biometrics and smart cards.
Select the particular method based upon the vulnerability of the ICS network to be protected, rather
than using the method that is available at the device level.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Enforce destination authorization. Users can be restricted and allowed to reach only the nodes on the
control network necessary for their job function. This reduces the potential of users intentionally or
accidentally gaining access to and control of devices for which they are not authorized, but adds to
the complexity for on-the-job-training or cross-training employees.
 Record information flow for traffic monitoring, analysis, and intrusion detection.
 Permit the ICS to implement operational policies appropriate to the ICS but that might not be
appropriate in an IT network, such as prohibition of less secure communications like email, and
permitted use of easy-to-remember usernames and group passwords.
 Be designed with documented and minimal (single if possible) connections that permit the ICS
network to be severed from the corporate network, should that decision be made, in times of serious
cyber incidents.
Other possible deployments include using either host-based firewalls or small standalone hardware
firewalls in front of, or running on, individual control devices. Using firewalls on an individual device
basis can create significant management overhead, especially in change management of firewall
configurations, however this practice will also simplify individual configuration rulesets.
There are several issues that must be addressed when deploying firewalls in ICS environments,
particularly the following:
 The possible addition of delay to control system communications.
 The lack of experience in the design of rule sets suitable for industrial applications. Firewalls used to
protect control systems should be configured so they do not permit either incoming or outgoing traffic
by default. The default configuration should be modified only when it is necessary to permit
connections to or from trusted systems to perform authorized ICS functions.
Firewalls require ongoing support, maintenance, and backup. Rule sets need to be reviewed to make sure
that they are providing adequate protection in light of ever-changing security threats. System capabilities
(e.g., storage space for firewall logs) should be monitored to make sure that the firewall is performing its
data collection tasks and can be depended upon in the event of a security violation. Real-time monitoring
of firewalls and other security sensors is required to rapidly detect and initiate response to cyber incidents.
5.4

Logically Separated Control Network

The ICS network should, at a minimum, be logically separated from the corporate network on physically
separate network devices. Based on the ICS network configuration, additional separation needs to be
considered for Safety Instrumented Systems and Security Systems (e.g., physical monitoring and access
controls, doors, gates, cameras, VoIP, access card readers) that are often either part of the ICS network or
utilize the same communications infrastructure for remote sites. When enterprise connectivity is required:
 There should be documented and minimal (single if possible) access points between the ICS network
and the corporate network. Redundant (i.e., backup) access points, if present, must be documented.
 A stateful firewall between the ICS network and corporate network should be configured to deny all
traffic except that which is explicitly authorized.
 The firewall rules should at a minimum provide source and destination filtering (i.e., filter on media
access control [MAC] address), in addition to TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port filtering
and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) type and code filtering.

5-6

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

An acceptable approach to enabling communication between an ICS network and a corporate network is
to implement an intermediate DMZ network. The DMZ should be connected to the firewall such that
specific (restricted) communication may occur between only the corporate network and the DMZ, and the
ICS network and the DMZ. The corporate network and the ICS network should not communicate directly
with each other. This approach is described in Sections 5.5.4 and 5.5.5. Additional security may be
obtained by implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between the ICS and external networks.
5.5

Network Segregation

ICS networks and corporate networks can be segregated to enhance cybersecurity using different
architectures. This section describes several possible architectures and explains the advantages and
disadvantages of each. Please note that the intent of the diagrams in Section 5.5 is to show the placement
of firewalls to segregate the network. Not all devices that would be typically found on the control network
or corporate network are shown. Section 5.6 provides guidance on a recommended defense-in-depth
architecture.
5.5.1

Dual-Homed Computer/Dual Network Interface Cards (NIC)

Dual-homed computers can pass network traffic from one network to another. A computer without proper
security controls could pose additional threats. To prevent this, no systems other than firewalls should be
configured as dual-homed to span both the control and corporate networks. All connections between the
control network and the corporate network should be through a firewall. This configuration provides no
security improvement and should not be used to bridge networks (e.g., ICS and corporate networks).
5.5.2

Firewall between Corporate Network and Control Network

By introducing a simple two-port firewall between the corporate and control networks, as shown in Figure
5-1, a significant security improvement can be achieved. Properly configured, a firewall significantly
reduces the chance of a successful external attack on the control network.
Unfortunately, two issues still remain with this design. First, if the data historian resides on the corporate
network, the firewall must allow the data historian to communicate with the control devices on the control
network. A packet originating from a malicious or incorrectly configured host on the corporate network
(appearing to be the data historian) would be forwarded to individual PLCs/DCS.

5-7

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Figure 5-1. Firewall between Corporate Network and Control Network

If the data historian resides on the control network, a firewall rule must exist that allows all hosts from the
enterprise to communicate with the historian. Typically, this communication occurs at the application
layer as Structured Query Language (SQL) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests. Flaws in the
historian’s application layer code could result in a compromised historian. Once the historian is
compromised, the remaining nodes on the control network are vulnerable to a worm propagating or an
interactive attack.
Another issue with having a simple firewall between the networks is that spoofed packets can be
constructed that can affect the control network, potentially permitting covert data to be tunneled in
allowed protocols. For example, if HTTP packets are allowed through the firewall, then Trojan horse
software accidentally introduced on an HMI or control network laptop could be controlled by a remote
entity and send data (such as captured passwords) to that entity, disguised as legitimate traffic.
In summary, while this architecture is a significant improvement over a non-segregated network, it
requires the use of firewall rules that allow direct communications between the corporate network and
control network devices. This can result in possible security breaches if not very carefully designed and
monitored [35].

Firewall and Router between Corporate Network and Control Network

A slightly more sophisticated design, shown in Figure 5-2, is the use of a router/firewall combination. The
router sits in front of the firewall and offers basic packet filtering services, while the firewall handles the
more complex issues using either stateful inspection or proxy techniques. This type of design is very
popular in Internet-facing firewalls because it allows the faster router to handle the bulk of the incoming
packets, especially in the case of DoS attacks, and reduces the load on the firewall. It also offers improved
defense-in-depth because there are two different devices an adversary must bypass [35].

5.5.4

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Firewall with DMZ between Corporate Network and Control Network

A significant improvement is the use of firewalls with the ability to establish a DMZ between the
corporate and control networks. Each DMZ holds one or more critical components, such as the data
historian, the wireless access point, or remote and third party access systems. In effect, the use of a DMZcapable firewall allows the creation of an intermediate network.
Creating a DMZ requires that the firewall offer three or more interfaces, rather than the typical public and
private interfaces. One of the interfaces is connected to the corporate network, the second to the control
network, and the remaining interfaces to the shared or insecure devices such as the data historian server or
wireless access points on the DMZ network. Implementing continuous ingress and egress traffic
monitoring on the DMZ is recommended. Additionally, firewall rulesets that only permit connections
between the control network and DMZ that are initiated by control network devices are recommended.
Figure 5-3 provides an example of this architecture.

Figure 5-3. Firewall with DMZ between Corporate Network and Control Network

5-10

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

By placing corporate-accessible components in the DMZ, no direct communication paths are required
from the corporate network to the control network; each path effectively ends in the DMZ. Most firewalls
can allow for multiple DMZs, and can specify what type of traffic may be forwarded between zones. As
Figure 5-3 shows, the firewall can block arbitrary packets from the corporate network from entering the
control network, and can also regulate traffic from the other network zones including the control network.
With well-planned rule sets, a clear separation can be maintained between the control network and other
networks, with little or no traffic passing directly between the corporate and control networks.
If a patch management server, an antivirus server, or other security server is to be used for the control
network, it should be located directly on the DMZ. Both functions could reside on a single server. Having
patch management and antivirus management dedicated to the control network allows for controlled and
secure updates that can be tailored for the unique needs of the ICS environment. It may also be helpful if
the antivirus product chosen for ICS protection is not the same as the antivirus product used for the
corporate network. For example, if a malware incident occurs and one antivirus product cannot detect or
stop the malware, it is somewhat likely that another product may have that capability.
The primary security risk in this type of architecture is that if a computer in the DMZ is compromised,
then it can be used to launch an attack against the control network via application traffic permitted from
the DMZ to the control network. This risk can be greatly reduced if a concerted effort is made to harden
and actively patch the servers in the DMZ and if the firewall ruleset permits only connections between the
control network and DMZ that are initiated by control network devices. Other concerns with this
architecture are the added complexity and the potential increased cost of firewalls with several ports. For
more critical systems, however, the improved security should more than offset these disadvantages [35].

Paired Firewalls between Corporate Network and Control Network

A variation on the firewall with a DMZ solution is to use a pair of firewalls positioned between the
corporate and ICS networks, as shown in Figure 5-4. Common servers such as the data historian are
situated between the firewalls in a DMZ-like network zone sometimes referred to as a Manufacturing
Execution System (MES) layer. As in the architectures described previously, the first firewall blocks
arbitrary packets from proceeding to the control network or the shared historians. The second firewall can
prevent unwanted traffic from a compromised server from entering the control network, and prevent
control network traffic from impacting the shared servers.

Figure 5-4. Paired Firewalls between Corporate Network and Control Network

5-12

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

If firewalls from two different manufacturers are used, then this solution may offer an advantage. It also
allows the control group and the IT group to have clearly separated device responsibility because each can
manage a firewall on its own, if the decision is made within the organization to do so. The primary
disadvantage with two-firewall architectures is the increased cost and management complexity. For
environments with stringent security requirements or the need for clear management separation, this
architecture has some strong advantages.
5.5.6

Network Segregation Summary

In summary, dual-homed computers generally not provide suitable isolation between control networks
and corporate networks. The two-zone solutions (no DMZ) are not recommended because they provide
only weak protection. If used, they should only be deployed with extreme care. The most secure,
manageable, and scalable control network and corporate network segregation architectures are typically
based on a system with at least three zones, incorporating one or more DMZs.
5.6

Recommended Defense-in-Depth Architecture

A single security product, technology or solution cannot adequately protect an ICS by itself. A multiple
layer strategy involving two (or more) different overlapping security mechanisms, a technique also known
as defense-in-depth, is desired so that the impact of a failure in any one mechanism is minimized. A
defense-in-depth architecture strategy includes the use of firewalls, the creation of demilitarized zones,
intrusion detection capabilities along with effective security policies, training programs, incident response
mechanisms and physical security. In addition, an effective defense-in-depth strategy requires a thorough
understanding of possible attack vectors on an ICS. These include:
 Backdoors and holes in network perimeter.
 Vulnerabilities in common protocols.
 Attacks on field devices.
 Database attacks.
 Communications hijacking and ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacks.
 Spoofing attacks.
 Attacks on privileged and/or shared accounts.
Figure 5-5 shows an ICS defense-in-depth architecture strategy that has been developed by the DHS
Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) NCCIC/ICS-CERT Recommended Practices committee13 as
described in the Control Systems Cyber Security: Defense in Depth Strategies [36] document. Additional
supporting documents that cover specific issues and associated mitigations are also included on the site.
The Control Systems Cyber Security: Defense in Depth Strategies document provides guidance and
direction for developing defense-in-depth architecture strategies for organizations that use control system
networks while maintaining a multi-tiered information architecture that requires:
 Maintenance of various field devices, telemetry collection, and/or industrial-level process systems.
 Access to facilities via remote data link or modem.
 Public facing services for customer or corporate operations.

This strategy includes firewalls, the use of demilitarized zones and intrusion detection capabilities
throughout the ICS architecture. The use of several demilitarized zones in Figure 5-5 provides the added
capability to separate functionalities and access privileges and has proved to be very effective in
protecting large architectures comprised of networks with different operational mandates. Intrusion
detection deployments apply different rule-sets and signatures unique to each domain being monitored.

5.7

General Firewall Policies for ICS

Once the defense-in-depth architecture is in place, the work of determining exactly what traffic should be
allowed through the firewalls begins. Configuring the firewalls to deny all except for the traffic absolutely
required for business needs is every organization’s basic premise, but the reality is much more difficult.
Exactly what does “absolutely required for business” mean and what are the security impacts of allowing
that traffic through? For example, many organizations considered allowing SQL traffic through the
firewall as required for business for many data historian servers. Unfortunately, the SQL vulnerability
was also the target for the Slammer worm [Table C-8. Example Adversarial Incidents]. Many important
protocols used in the industrial world, such as HTTP, FTP, OPC/DCOM, EtherNet/IP, and Modbus/TCP,
have significant security vulnerabilities.
The remaining material in this section summarizes some of the key points from the Centre for the
Protection of National Infrastructure’s (CPNI) Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control
Networks: Good Practice Guide [35].
When installing a single two-port firewall without a DMZ for shared servers (i.e., the architecture
described in Section 5.5.2), particular care needs to be taken with the rule design. At a minimum, all rules

5-14

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

should be stateful rules that are both IP address and port (application) specific. The address portion of the
rules should restrict incoming traffic to a very small set of shared devices (e.g., the data historian) on the
control network from a controlled set of addresses on the corporate network. Allowing any IP addresses
on the corporate network to access servers inside the control network is not recommended. In addition,
the allowed ports should be carefully restricted to relatively secure protocols such as Hypertext Transfer
Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Allowing HTTP, FTP, or other unsecured protocols to cross the firewall is a
security risk due to the potential for traffic sniffing and modification. Rules should be added to deny hosts
outside the control network from initiating connections with hosts on the control network. Rules should
only allow devices internal to the control network the ability to establish connections outside the control
network.
On the other hand, if the DMZ architecture is being used, then it is possible to configure the system so
that no traffic will go directly between the corporate network and the control network. With a few special
exceptions (noted below), all traffic from either side can terminate at the servers in the DMZ. This allows
more flexibility in the protocols allowed through the firewall. For example, Modbus/TCP might be used
to communicate from the PLCs to the data historian, while HTTP might be used for communication
between the historian and enterprise clients. Both protocols are inherently insecure, yet in this case they
can be used safely because neither actually crosses between the two networks. An extension to this
concept is the idea of using “disjoint” protocols in all control network to corporate network
communications. That is, if a protocol is allowed between the control network and DMZ, then it is
explicitly not allowed between the DMZ and corporate network. This design greatly reduces the chance
of a worm such as Slammer actually making its way into the control network, because the worm would
have to use two different exploits over two different protocols.
One area of considerable variation in practice is the control of outbound traffic from the control network,
which could represent a significant risk if unmanaged. One example is Trojan horse software that uses
HTTP tunneling to exploit poorly defined outbound rules. Thus, it is important that outbound rules be as
stringent as inbound rules.
Example outbound rules include:
 Outbound traffic through the control network firewall should be limited to essential communications
only and should be limited to authorized traffic originating from DMZ servers.
 All outbound traffic from the control network to the corporate network should be source and
destination-restricted by service and port.
In addition to these rules, the firewall should be configured with outbound filtering to stop forged IP
packets from leaving the control network or the DMZ. In practice this is achieved by checking the source
IP addresses of outgoing packets against the firewall’s respective network interface address. The intent is
to prevent the control network from being the source of spoofed (i.e., forged) communications, which are
often used in DoS attacks. Thus, the firewalls should be configured to forward IP packets only if those
packets have a correct source IP address for the control network or DMZ networks. Finally, Internet
access by devices on the control network should be strongly discouraged.

5-15

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

In summary, the following should be considered as recommended practice for general firewall rule sets:
 The base rule set should be deny all, permit none.
 Ports and services between the control network environment and the corporate network should be
enabled and permissions granted on a specific case-by-case basis. There should be a documented
business justification with risk analysis and a responsible person for each permitted incoming or
outgoing data flow.
 All “permit” rules should be both IP address and TCP/UDP port specific, and stateful if appropriate.
 All rules should restrict traffic to a specific IP address or range of addresses.
 Traffic should be prevented from transiting directly from the control network to the corporate
network. All traffic should terminate in the DMZ.
 Any protocol allowed between the control network and DMZ should explicitly NOT be allowed
between the DMZ and corporate networks (and vice-versa).
 All outbound traffic from the control network to the corporate network should be source and
destination-restricted by service and port.
 Outbound packets from the control network or DMZ should be allowed only if those packets have a
correct source IP address that is assigned to the control network or DMZ devices.
 Control network devices should not be allowed to access the Internet.
 Control networks should not be directly connected to the Internet, even if protected via a firewall.
 All firewall management traffic should be carried on either a separate, secured management network
(e.g., out of band) or over an encrypted network with multi-factor authentication. Traffic should also
be restricted by IP address to specific management stations.
 All firewall policies should be tested periodically.
 All firewalls should be backed up immediately prior to commissioning.
These should be considered only as guidelines. A careful assessment of each control environment is
required before implementing any firewall rule sets.
5.8

Recommended Firewall Rules for Specific Services

Beside the general rules described above, it is difficult to outline all-purpose rules for specific protocols.
The needs and recommended practices vary significantly between industries for any given protocol and
should be analyzed on an organization-by-organization basis. The Industrial Automation Open
Networking Association (IAONA) offers a template for conducting such an analysis [37], assessing each
of the protocols commonly found in industrial environments in terms of function, security risk, worst case
impact, and suggested measures. Some of the key points from the IAONA document are summarized in
this section. The reader is advised to consult this document directly when developing rule sets.

5-16

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

5.8.1

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Domain Name System (DNS)

Domain Name System (DNS) is primarily used to translate between domain names and IP addresses. For
example, a DNS could map a domain name such as control.com to an IP address such as 192.168.1.1.
Most Internet services rely heavily on DNS, but its use on the control network is relatively rare at this
time. In most cases there is little reason to allow DNS requests out of the control network to the corporate
network and no reason to allow DNS requests into the control network. DNS requests from the control
network to DMZ should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Local DNS or the use of host files is
recommended.
5.8.2

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

HTTP is the protocol underlying Web browsing services on the Internet. Like DNS, it is critical to most
Internet services. It is seeing increasing use on the plant floor as well as an all-purpose query tool.
Unfortunately, it has little inherent security, and many HTTP applications have vulnerabilities that can be
exploited. HTTP can be a transport mechanism for many manually performed attacks and automated
worms.
In general, HTTP should not be allowed to cross from the public/corporate to the control network.
If web-based technologies are absolutely required, the following best practices should be applied:
 Control access to web-based services on the physical or network layer using white-listing;
 Apply access control to both source and destination;
 Implement authorization to access the service on the application layer (instead of physical or
network-layer checks);
 Implement service using only the necessary technologies (e.g., scripts are used only if they are
required);
 Check service according to known application security practices;
 Log all attempts of service usage ; and
 Use HTTPS rather than HTTP, and only for specific authorized devices.
5.8.3

FTP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)

FTP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) are used for transferring files between devices. They are
implemented on almost every platform including many SCADA systems, DCS, PLCs, and RTUs, because
they are very well known and use minimum processing power. Unfortunately, neither protocol was
created with security in mind; for FTP, the login password is not encrypted, and for TFTP, no login is
required at all. Furthermore, some FTP implementations have a history of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
As a result, all TFTP communications should be blocked, while FTP communications should be allowed
for outbound sessions only or if secured with additional token-based multi-factor authentication and an
encrypted tunnel. More secure protocols, such as Secure FTP (SFTP) or Secure Copy (SCP), should be
employed whenever possible.
5.8.4

Telnet

The telnet protocol defines an interactive, text-based communications session between a client and a host.
It is used mainly for remote login and simple control services to systems with limited resources or to
systems with limited needs for security. It is a severe security risk because all telnet traffic, including
passwords, is unencrypted, and it can allow a remote individual considerable control over a device. It is
recommended to use the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol [5.8.6] for remote administration. Inbound telnet

5-17

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

sessions from the corporate to the control network should be prohibited unless secured with token-based
multi-factor authentication and an encrypted tunnel. Outbound telnet sessions should be allowed only
over encrypted tunnels (e.g., VPN) to specific authorized devices.
5.8.5

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

DHCP is used on IP networks for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP
addresses for interfaces and services. The base DHCP includes no mechanism for authenticating servers
and clients. Rogue DHCP servers can provide incorrect information to clients. Unauthorized clients can
gain access to server and cause exhaustion of available resources (e.g., IP addresses). To prevent this, it is
recommended to use static configuration instead of dynamic address allocation, which should be the
typical configuration for ICS devices. If dynamic allocation is necessary, it is recommended to enable
DHCP snooping to defend against rogue DHCP servers, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and IP
spoofing. The DHCP servers should be placed in the same network segment as configured equipment
(e.g., on the router). DHCP relaying is not recommended.
5.8.6

Secure Shell (SSH)

SSH allows remote access to a device. It provides secure authentication and authorization based on
cryptography. If remote access is required to the control network, SSH is recommended as the alternative
to telnet, rlogin, rsh, rcp and other insecure remote access tools.
5.8.7

Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)

SOAP is an XML-based format syntax to exchange messages. Traffic flows related to SOAP-based
services should be controlled at the firewall between corporate and ICS network segments. If these
services are necessary, deep-packet inspection and/or application layer firewalls should be used to restrict
the contents of messages.
5.8.8

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

SMTP is the primary email transfer protocol on the Internet. Email messages often contain malware, so
inbound email should not be allowed to any control network device. Outbound SMTP mail messages
from the control network to the corporate network are acceptable to send alert messages.
5.8.9

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

SNMP is used to provide network management services between a central management console and
network devices such as routers, printers, and PLCs. Although SNMP is an extremely useful service for
maintaining a network, it is very weak in security. Versions 1 and 2 of SNMP use unencrypted passwords
to both read and configure devices (including devices such as PLCs), and in many cases the passwords are
well known and cannot be changed. Version 3 is considerably more secure but is still limited in use.
SNMP V1 & V2 commands both to and from the control network should be prohibited unless they are
over a separate, secured management network, whereas SNMP V3 commands may be able to be sent to
the ICS using the security features inherent to V3.

5-18

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

5.8.10 Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
DCOM is the underlying protocol for OLE for Process Control (OPC). It utilizes Microsoft’s Remote
Procedure Call (RPC) service which, when not patched, has many vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities
were the basis for the Blaster worm14 exploits. In addition, OPC, which utilizes DCOM, dynamically
opens a wide range of ports (1024 to 65535) that can be extremely difficult to filter at the firewall. This
protocol should only be allowed between control network and DMZ networks and explicitly blocked
between the DMZ and corporate network. Also, users are advised to restrict the port ranges used by
making registry modifications on devices using DCOM.
5.8.11 SCADA and Industrial Protocols
15

SCADA and industrial protocols, such as Modbus/TCP, EtherNet/IP, IEC 61850, ICCP and DNP3 , are
critical for communications to most control devices. Unfortunately, many of these protocols were
designed without security built in and do not typically require any authentication to remotely execute
commands on a control device. These protocols should only be allowed within the control network and
not allowed to cross into the corporate network.
5.9

Network Address Translation (NAT)

Network address translation (NAT) is a service where IP addresses used on one side of a network device
can be mapped to a different set on the other side on an as-needed basis. It was originally designed for IP
address reduction purposes so that an organization with a large number of devices that occasionally
needed Internet access could get by with a smaller set of assigned Internet addresses.
To do this, most NAT implementations rely on the premise that not every internal device is actively
communicating with external hosts at a given moment. The firewall is configured to have a limited
number of outwardly visible IP addresses. When an internal host seeks to communicate with an external
host, the firewall remaps the internal IP address and port to one of the currently unused, more limited,
public IP addresses, effectively concentrating outgoing traffic into fewer IP addresses. The firewall must
track the state of each connection and how each private internal IP address and source port was remapped
onto an outwardly visible IP address/port pair. When returning traffic reaches the firewall, the mapping is
reversed and the packets forwarded to the proper internal host.
For example, a control network device may need to establish a connection with an external, non-control
network host (for instance, to send a critical alert email). NAT allows the internal IP address of the
initiating control network host to be replaced by the firewall; subsequent return traffic packets are
remapped back to the internal IP address and sent to the appropriate control network device. More
specifically, if the control network is assigned the private subnet 192.168.1.xxx and the Internet network
expects the device to use the corporate assigned addresses in the range 192.6.yyy.zzz, then a NAT
firewall will substitute (and track) a 192.6.yyy.zzz source address into every outbound IP packet
generated by a control network device.
Producer-consumer protocols, such as EtherNet/IP and Foundation Fieldbus, are particularly troublesome
because NAT does not support the multicast-based traffic that these protocols need to offer their full
services.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

In general, while NAT offers some distinct advantages, its impact on the actual industrial protocols and
configuration should be assessed carefully before it is deployed. Furthermore, certain protocols are
specifically broken by NAT because of the lack of direct addressing. For example, OPC requires special
third-party tunneling software to work with NAT.
5.10 Specific ICS Firewall Issues
In addition to the issues with firewalls and ICS already discussed, there are some additional problems that
need to be examined in more detail. The rest of this section discusses three specific areas of concern: the
placement of data historians, remote access for ICS support, and multicast traffic.
5.10.1 Data Historians
The existence of shared control network/corporate network servers such as data historians and asset
management servers can have a significant impact on firewall design and configuration. In three-zone
systems the placement of these servers in a DMZ is relatively straightforward, but in two-zone designs the
issues become complex. Placing the historian on the corporate side of the firewall means that a number of
insecure protocols, such as Modbus/TCP or DCOM, must be allowed through the firewall and that every
control device reporting to the historian is exposed to the corporate side of the network. On the other
hand, putting the historian on the control network side means other equally questionable protocols, such
as HTTP or SQL, must be allowed through the firewall, and there is now a server accessible to nearly
everyone in the organization sitting on the control network.
In general, the best solution is to avoid two-zone systems (no DMZ) and use a three-zone design, placing
the data collector in the control network and the historian component in the DMZ.
5.10.2 Remote Support Access
Another issue for ICS firewall design is user and/or vendor remote access into the control network. Any
users accessing the control network from remote networks should be required to authenticate using an
appropriately strong mechanism such as token-based authentication. While it is possible for the controls
group to set up their own remote access system with multi-factor authentication on the DMZ, in most
organizations it is typically more efficient to use existing systems set up by the IT department. In this case
a connection through the firewall from the IT remote access server is needed.
Remote support personnel connecting over the Internet or via dialup modems should use an encrypted
protocol, such as running a corporate VPN connection client, application server, or secure HTTP access,
and authenticate using a strong mechanism, such as a token based multi-factor authentication scheme, in
order to connect to the general corporate network. Once connected, they should be required to
authenticate a second time at the control network firewall using a strong mechanism, such as a token
based multi-factor authentication scheme, to gain access to the control network. Proxy servers can also
provide additional capabilities for securing remote support access.
5.10.3 Multicast Traffic
Most industrial producer-consumer (or publisher-subscriber) protocols operating over Ethernet, such as
EtherNet/IP and Foundation Fieldbus HSE, are IP multicast-based. The first advantage of IP multicasting
is network efficiency; by not repeating the data transmission to the multiple destinations, a significant
reduction in network load can occur. The second advantage is that the sending host need not be concerned
with knowing every IP address of every destination host listening for the broadcast information. The
third, and perhaps most important for industrial control purposes, is that a single multicast message offers

5-20

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

far better capabilities for time synchronization between multiple control devices than multiple unicast
messages.
If the source and destinations of a multicast packet are connected with no intervening routers or firewalls
between them, the multicast transmission is relatively seamless. However, if the source and destinations
are not on the same LAN, forwarding the multicast messages to a destination becomes more complicated.
To solve the problem of multicast message routing, hosts need to join (or leave) a group by informing the
multicast router on their network of the relevant group ID through the use of the Internet Group
Management Protocol (IGMP). Multicast routers subsequently know of the members of multicast groups
on their network and can decide whether or not to forward a received multicast message onto their
network. A multicast routing protocol is also required. From a firewall administration perspective,
monitoring and filtering IGMP traffic becomes another series of rule sets to manage, adding to the
complexity of the firewall.
Another firewall issue related to multicasting is the use of NAT. A firewall performing NAT that receives
a multicast packet from an external host has no reverse mapping for which internal group ID should
receive the data. If IGMP-aware, it could broadcast it to every group ID it knows about, because one of
them will be correct, but this could cause serious issues if an unintended control packet were broadcast to
a critical node. The safest action for the firewall to take is to drop the packet. Thus, multicasting is
generally considered NAT-unfriendly.
5.11 Unidirectional Gateways
Hardware-enforced unidirectional gateways (e.g., data diodes) are increasingly deployed at the boundary
between ICS and IT networks, as well as between Safety Instrumented System networks and control
networks. Unidirectional gateways are a combination of hardware and software. The hardware permits
data to flow from one network to another, but is physically unable to send any information at all back into
the source network. The software replicates databases and emulates protocol servers and devices.
5.12 Single Points of Failure
Single points of failure can exist at any level of the ANSI/ISO stack. An example is PLC control of safety
interlocks. Because security is usually being added to the ICS environment, an evaluation should be done
to identify potential failure points and a risk assessment done to evaluate each point’s exposure.
Remediation methods can then be postulated and evaluated and a “risk versus reward” determination
made and design and implementation done.
5.13 Redundancy and Fault Tolerance
ICS components or networks that are classified as critical to the organization have high availability
requirements. One method of achieving high availability is through the use of redundancy. Additionally,
if a component fails, it should fail in a manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the ICS, or
does not cause another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event.
The control system should have the ability to execute an appropriate fail-safe process upon the loss of
communications with the ICS or the loss of the ICS itself. The organization should define what "loss of
communications" means (e.g., 500 milliseconds, 5 seconds, 5 minutes, etc. without communications). The
organization should then, based on potential consequences, define the appropriate fail-safe process for
their industry.

5-21

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Backups should be performed using the “backup-in-depth” approach, with layers of backups (e.g., local,
facility, disaster) that are time-sequenced such that rapid recent local backups are available for immediate
use and secure backups are available to recover from a massive security incident. A mixture of
backup/restore approaches and storage methods should be used to ensure that backups are rigorously
produced, securely stored, and appropriately accessible for restoration.
5.14 Preventing Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
A man-in-the-middle attack requires knowledge of the protocol being manipulated. The Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) man-in-the-middle attack is a popular method for an adversary to gain access
to the network flow of information on a target system. This is performed by attacking the network ARP
cache tables of the controller and the workstation machines. Using the compromised computer on the
control network, the adversary poisons the ARP tables on each host and informs them that they must
route all their traffic through a specific IP and hardware address (i.e., the adversary’s machine). By
manipulating the ARP tables, the adversary can insert their machine between the two target machines
and/or devices.
The ARP man-in-the-middle attack works by initiating gratuitous ARP commands to confuse each host
(i.e., ARP poisoning). These ARP commands cause each of the two target hosts to use the MAC address
of the adversary as the address for the other target host. When a successful man-in-the-middle attack is
performed, the hosts on each side of the attack are unaware that their network data is taking a different
route through the adversary’s computer.
Once an adversary has successfully inserted their machine into the information stream, they now have full
control over the data communications and could carry out several types of attacks. One possible attack
method is the replay attack. In its simplest form, captured data from the control/HMI is modified to
instantiate activity when received by the device controller. Captured data reflecting normal operations in
the ICS could be played back to the operator as required. This would cause the operator’s HMI to appear
to be normal and the attack will go unobserved. During this replay attack the adversary could continue to
send commands to the controller and/or field devices to cause an undesirable event while the operator is
unaware of the true state of the system.
Another attack that could be carried out with the man-in-the-middle attack is sending false messages to
the operator, and could take the form of a false negative or a false positive. This may cause the operator to
take an action, such as flipping a breaker, when it is not required, or it may cause the operator to think
everything is fine and not take an action when an action is required. The adversary could send commands
to the operator’s console indicating a system change, and when the operator follows normal procedures
and attempts to correct the problem, the operator’s action could cause an undesirable event. There are
variations of the modification and replay of control data which could impact the operations of the system.
Protocol manipulation and the man-in-the-middle attack are among the most popular ways to manipulate
insecure protocols, such as those found in control systems. However, there are mitigation techniques [38]
that can be applied to secure the systems through MAC address locking, static tables, encryption,
authentication, and monitoring.
 MAC Address Locking - The ARP man-in-the-middle attack requires the adversary to be connected
to the local network or have control of a local computer on the network. Port security, also called
MAC address locking, is one method to secure the physical connection at the end of each port on a
network switch. High-end corporate class network switches usually have some kind of option for
MAC address locking. MAC address locking is very effective against a rogue individual looking to
physically plug into the internal network. Without port security, any open network jack on the wall

5-22

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

could be used as an avenue onto the corporate network. Port security locks a specific MAC address to
a specific port on a managed switch. If the MAC address does not match, the communication link is
disabled and the intruder will not be able to achieve their goal. Some of the more advanced switches
have an auto resetting option, which will reset the security measure if the original MAC is returned to
the port.
Although port security is not attacker proof, it does add a layer of added security to the physical
network. It also protects the local network from employees plugging un-patched and out-of-date
systems onto the protected network. This reduces the number of target computers a remote adversary
can access. These security measures not only protect against attacks from external networks but
provide added physical protection as well.
 Static Tables – An ICS network that stays relatively static could attempt to implement statically
coded ARP tables. Most operating systems have the capability to statically code all of the MAC
addresses into the ARP table on each computer. Statically coding the ARP tables on each computer
prevents the adversary from changing them by sending ARP reply packets to the victim computer.
While this technique is not feasible on a large and/or dynamic corporate network, the limited number
of hosts on an ICS network could be effectively protected this way.
 Encryption - As a longer-term solution, systems should be designed to include encryption between
devices in order to make it very difficult to reverse engineer protocols and forge packets on control
system networks. Encrypting the communications between devices would make it nearly impossible
to perform this attack. Protocols that provide strong authentication also provide resilience to man-inthe-middle attacks. The impact of encryption on network and operational performance needs to be
considered.
 Authentication - Protocols with strong authentication provide resilience to man-in-the-middle
attacks.
 Monitoring - Monitoring for ARP poisoning provides an added layer of defense. There are several
programs available (e.g., ARPwatch) that can monitor for changing MAC addresses through the ARP
packets.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

5.15 Authentication and Authorization
An ICS may contain a large number of systems, each of which must be accessed by a variety of users.
Performing the authentication and authorization of these users presents a challenge to the ICS. Managing
these user’s accounts can be problematic as employees are added, removed, and as their roles change. As
the number of systems and users grow, the process of managing these accounts becomes more
complicated.
The authentication of a user or system is the process of verifying the claimed identity. Authorization, the
process of granting the user access privileges, is determined by applying policy rules to the authenticated
identity and other relevant information16. Authorization is enforced by some access control mechanism.
The authentication process can be used to control access to both systems (e.g. HMIs, field devices,
SCADA servers) and networks (e.g., remote substations LANs).
Authentication and authorization can be performed either in a distributed or centralized approach. With
distributed authentication and authorization, every system performs these steps on their own. Each system
is responsible for storing its own set of user accounts, credentials, and roles and performing the
identification and authentication of the user. This approach typically does not require any additional
infrastructure. However, this approach is problematic in that it does not scale well as the size of the
system increases. For example, if a user leaves the organization, the corresponding user account must be
removed from each system individually.
In contrast to the distributed approach, centralized authentication and authorization systems are
commonly used to manage larger number of users and accounts. A centralized approach utilizes some
central authentication system (e.g., Microsoft Active Directory, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) to store all accounts and manage the authentication and authorization of all individuals and
systems. An authentication protocol (e.g., Kerberos, RADIUS, TACACS+) is then used to communicate
data between the authentication server and the system performing authentication.
While a centralized approach provides substantially improved scalability, it also presents numerous
additional concerns that may impact its use in ICS environments. The following considerations apply:
 Authentication servers create a single system that is responsible for managing all system accounts and
must be highly secured.
 The authentications server system requires high availability because its failure may prevent users
from authenticating to a system during an emergency. Redundancy may be required.
 Some clients may cache user credentials locally to ensure that users can still be authenticated in the
absence of the server. Caching may only be available for users that have recently authenticated.
Caching also introduces complications for revocation.
 Networks used to support the authentication protocol must be reliable and secure to ensure
authentication attempts are not hindered.

16

In general, authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated with the subject,
object, requested operations, and, in some cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or relationships that describe
the allowable operations for a given set of attributes. For further information see NIST SP 800-162, Guide to Attribute
Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations, at
http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/NIST.SP.800162.pdf.http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/NIST.sp.800-162.pdf

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

5.15.1 ICS Implementation Considerations
While centralized authentication and authorization servers are commonly used in an IT environment,
there are many challenges to integrating them into ICS. While authentication servers and protocols
integrate with many commodity IT products (e.g., Microsoft Windows, Linux, Oracle), often ICS may
utilize their own application-specific accounts and authentication mechanisms that were not designed to
interface with third party servers and protocols. This limits the adoption of such mechanism in an ICS
environment. Older network devices and most field devices do not support any mechanisms to integrated
with a centralized authentication system.
5.16 Monitoring, Logging, and Auditing
The security architecture of an ICS must also incorporate mechanisms to monitor, log, and audit activities
occurring on various systems and networks. Monitoring, logging, and auditing activities are imperative to
understanding the current state of the ICS, validating that the system is operating as intended, and that no
policy violations or cyber incidents have hindered the operation of the system. Network security
monitoring is valuable to characterize the normal state of the ICS, and can provide indications of
compromised systems when signature-based technologies fail. Additionally, strong system monitoring,
logging, and auditing is necessary to troubleshoot and perform any necessary forensic analysis of the
system17.
5.17 Incident Detection, Response, and System Recovery
Incidents are inevitable and incident detection, response, and system recovery plans are essential. Major
characteristics of a good security program are how soon after an incident has occurred that the incident
can be detected and how quickly a system can be recovered after an incident has been detected. Incident
response in ICS is closely aligned to disaster recovery, specifically to address the stringent uptime
requirements of ICS. Incident Responders must be trained for ICS-specific scenarios, as normal methods
of recovering IT systems may not apply to ICS.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Applying Security Controls to ICS

A single security product or technology cannot adequately protect an ICS. Securing an ICS is based on a
combination of effective security policies and a properly configured set of security controls. The selection
and implementation of security controls to apply to an ICS can have major implications on the operations,
so it is critical to consider:
 Which security controls are needed to adequately mitigate risk to an acceptable level that supports the
organizational missions and business functions?
 Have the selected security controls been implemented or is there a realistic implementation plan in
place?
 What is the required level of assurance that the selected security controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing a desired outcome?
As identified in Section 3, the questions should be answered in the context of an effective, organizationwide risk management process and cybersecurity strategy that identifies, mitigates (as necessary), and
continuously monitors risks to its ICS. An effective cybersecurity strategy for an ICS should apply
defense-in-depth, a technique of layering security mechanisms so that the impact of a failure in any one
mechanism is minimized. Use of such a strategy is explored within the security control discussions and
their applications to ICS that follow.
6.1 Executing the Risk Management Framework Tasks for Industrial Control Systems
The following describes the process of applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to ICS. The
process includes a brief description of each activity and identifies supporting NIST documents. The
following steps, while shown sequentially, can be implemented in a different order to be consistent with
established management and system development life cycle processes [21].

Step 1: Categorize Information System

The first activity in the RMF is to categorize the information and information system according to
potential impact of loss. For each information type and information system under consideration, the three
FISMA-defined security objectives—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—are associated with one
of three levels of potential impact should there be a breach of security. It is important to remember that
for an ICS, availability is generally the greatest concern.
The standards and guidance for this categorization process can be found in FIPS 199 [15] and NIST SP
800-60 [25], respectively. NIST is in the process of updating NIST SP 800-60 to provide additional
guidance on the categorization of ICS.

6-2

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

The following ICS example is taken from FIPS 199 [15]:
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
A power plant contains a SCADA system controlling the distribution of electric power for a large
military installation. The SCADA system contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative
information. The management at the power plant determines that: (i) for the sensor data being acquired
by the SCADA system, there is no potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a high potential
impact from a loss of integrity, and a high potential impact from a loss of availability; and (ii) for the
administrative information being processed by the system, there is a low potential impact from a loss of
confidentiality, a low potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a low potential impact from a loss of
availability. The resulting security categories, SC, of these information types are expressed as:
SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)},
and
SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}.
The resulting security category of the information system is initially expressed as:
SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)},
representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective from
the information types resident on the SCADA system. The management at the power plant chooses to
increase the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality from low to moderate, reflecting a more
realistic view of the potential impact on the information system should there be a security breach due to
the unauthorized disclosure of system-level information or processing functions. The final security
category of the information system is expressed as:
SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}.

FIPS 199 specifies that information systems be categorized as low-impact, moderate-impact, or highimpact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Possible definitions for
low, moderate, and high levels of security based on impact for ICS based on ISA99 are provided in Table
6-1. Possible definitions for ICS impact levels based on product produced, industry and security concerns

Step 2: Select Security Controls

This framework activity includes the initial selection of minimum security controls planned or in place to
protect the information system based on a set of requirements. FIPS 200 documents a set of minimumsecurity requirements covering 18 security-related areas with regard to protecting the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of federal information systems and the information processed, stored, and
transmitted by those systems [16]. Additional information on each of the 18 security control families is in
Section 6.2.
The baseline controls are the starting point for the security control selection process and chosen based on
the security category and associate impact level of information systems determined in Step 1.
To address the need for developing community-wide and specialized sets of security controls for
information systems and organizations, the concept of overlays is introduced. An overlay is a fully
specified set of security controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from the
application of tailoring guidance to security control baselines described in NIST SP 800-53.
In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring of baselines by organizations
through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements that more closely correspond to
common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. However, the use of overlays does not in any way
preclude organizations from performing further tailoring (i.e., overlays can also be subject to tailoring) to
reflect organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. For further information on creating
overlays, refer to SP 800-53, Section 3.3 and Appendix I.
Appendix G— includes an ICS-specific overlay of applicable NIST SP 800-53 controls that provide
tailored baselines for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact ICS. These tailored baselines can be
utilized as starting specifications and recommendations that can be applied to specific ICS by responsible
personnel. As discussed in earlier sections, the use of an overlay does not in any way preclude
organizations from performing further tailoring to add or remove controls and control enhancements (i.e.,
overlays can also be subject to tailoring) to reflect organization-specific needs, assumptions, or
constraints.

6-4

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Additionally, ICS owners can take advantage of the ability to tailor the initial baselines presented in the
Appendix G— Overlay when it is not possible or feasible to implement specific security controls
contained in the baselines. However, all tailoring activity should, as its primary goal, focus on meeting the
intent of the original security controls whenever possible or feasible. For example, in situations where the
ICS cannot support, or the organization determines it is not advisable to implement particular security
controls or control enhancements in an ICS (e.g., performance, safety, or reliability are adversely
impacted), the organization provides a complete and convincing rationale for how the selected
compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or level of protection for the ICS and
why the related baseline security controls could not be employed. If the ICS cannot support the use of
automated mechanisms, the organization employs non-automated mechanisms or procedures as
compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance in Section 3.3 of NIST SP 80053. Compensating controls are not exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls; rather, they are
alternative safeguards and countermeasures employed within the ICS that accomplish the intent of the
original security controls that could not be effectively employed. Organizational decisions on the use of
compensating controls are documented in the security plan for the ICS.
6.1.3

Step 3: Implement Security Controls

This activity involves the implementation of security controls in new or legacy information systems. The
security control selection process described in this section can be applied to ICS from two different
perspectives: (i) new development; and (ii) legacy.
For new development systems, the security control selection process is applied from a requirements
definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial security
categorizations. The security controls included in the security plans for the information systems serve as a
security specification and are expected to be incorporated into the systems during the development and
implementation phases of the system development life cycle.
In contrast, for legacy information systems, the security control selection process is applied from a gap
analysis perspective when organizations are anticipating significant changes to the systems (e.g., during
major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the information systems already exist,
organizations in all likelihood have completed the security categorization and security control selection
processes resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon security controls in the respective
security plans and the implementation of those controls within the information systems.
6.1.4

Step 4: Assess Security Controls

This activity determines the extent to which the security controls in the information system are effective
in their application. NIST SP 800-53A provides guidance for assessing security controls initially selected
from NIST SP 800-53 to ensure that they are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements of the system. To accomplish this,
NIST SP 800-53A provides expectations based on assurance requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 for
characterizing the expectations of security assessments by FIPS 199 impact level.
6.1.5

Step 5: Authorize Information System

This activity results in a management decision to authorize the operation of an information system and to
explicitly accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation
of an agreed-upon set of security controls.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Step 6: Monitor Security Controls

This activity continuously tracks changes to the information system that may affect security controls and
assesses control effectiveness. NIST SP 800-137 provides guidance on information security continuous
monitoring [21].
6.2 Guidance on the Application of Security Controls to ICS
Because today’s ICS are often a combination of legacy systems, often with a planned life span of twenty
to thirty years, or a hybrid of legacy systems augmented with newer hardware and software that are
interconnected to other systems, it is often difficult or infeasible to apply some of the security controls
contained in NIST SP 800-53. While many controls in Appendix F of NIST SP 800-53 are applicable to
ICS as written, several controls did require ICS-specific interpretation and/or augmentation. Appendix I
of NIST SP 800-53 provides an example overlay template and additional information on each section of
the overlay.
The NIST SP 800-53 controls are organized into 18 families; each family contains security controls
related to the general security topic of the family. Security controls may involve aspects of policy,
oversight, supervision, manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms implemented
by information systems/devices. The 18 security-related areas discussed in the following sections are:
 Access Control (AC): the process of granting or denying specific requests for obtaining and using
information and related information processing services for physical access to areas within the
information system environment.
 Awareness and Training (AT): policies and procedures to ensure that all information system users
are given appropriate security training relative to their usage of the system and that accurate training
records are maintained.
 Audit and Accountability (AU): independent review and examination of records and activities to
assess the adequacy of system controls, to ensure compliance with established policies and
operational procedures, and to recommend necessary changes in controls, policies, or procedures.
 Security Assessment and Authorization (CA): assurance that the specified controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome.
 Contingency Planning (CP): policies and procedures designed to maintain or restore business
operations, including computer operations, possibly at an alternate location, in the event of
emergencies, system failures, or disaster.
 Configuration Management (CM): policies and procedures for controlling modifications to
hardware, firmware, software, and documentation to ensure the information system is protected
against improper modifications prior to, during, and after system implementation.
 Identification and Authentication (IA): the process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or
device, through the use of specific credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens, biometrics), as a prerequisite
for granting access to resources in an IT system.
 Incident Response (IR): policies and procedures pertaining to incident response training, testing,
handling, monitoring, reporting, and support services.
 Maintenance (MA): policies and procedures to manage all maintenance aspects of an information
system.

 Media Protection (MP): policies and procedures to ensure secure handling of media. Controls cover
access, labeling, storage, transport, sanitization, destruction, and disposal.
 Physical and Environmental Protection (PE): policies and procedures addressing physical,
transmission, and display access control as well as environmental controls for conditioning (e.g.,
temperature, humidity) and emergency provisions (e.g., shutdown, power, lighting, fire protection).
 Planning (PL): development and maintenance of a plan to address information system security by
performing assessments, specifying and implementing security controls, assigning security levels, and
responding to incidents.
 Personnel Security (PS): policies and procedures for personnel position categorization, screening,
transfer, penalty, and termination; also addresses third-party personnel security.
 Risk Assessment (RA): the process of identifying risks to operations, assets, or individuals by
determining the probability of occurrence, the resulting impact, and additional security controls that
would mitigate this impact.
 System and Services Acquisition (SA): allocation of resources for information system security to be
maintained throughout the systems life cycle and the development of acquisition policies based on
risk assessment results including requirements, design criteria, test procedures, and associated
documentation.
 System and Communications Protection (SC): mechanisms for protecting both system and data
transmission components.
 System and Information Integrity (SI): policies and procedures to protect information systems and
their data from design flaws and data modification using functionality verification, data integrity
checking, intrusion detection, malicious code detection, and security alert and advisory controls.
 Program Management (PM): provides security controls at the organizational rather than the
information-system level.
Additionally, Appendix J of NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 includes a catalog of Privacy Controls. Privacy
controls are the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within organizations to
protect and ensure the proper handling of personally identifiable information (PII).18 The 8 privacy
control families are each aligned with the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPS),19 which are
designed to build public trust in an organization’s privacy practices and to help organizations avoid
tangible costs and intangible damages stemming from privacy incidents.

18

OMB Memorandum 07-16 defines PII as “information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity such
as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc., alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying
information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.”
[86]. OMB Memorandum 10-22 reaffirmed this definition [87]. NIST Special Publication 800-122 defines PII as “any
information about an individual [that is] maintained by an agency, including: (i) any information that can be used to
distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden
name, or biometric records; and (ii) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical,
educational, financial, and employment information” [88].
19
The FIPPs are widely accepted in the United States and internationally as a general framework for privacy and are reflected in
other federal and international laws and policies. In a number of organizations, FIPPs serve as the basis for analyzing privacy
risks and determining appropriate mitigation strategies. The Federal Enterprise Architecture Security and Privacy Profile
(FEA-SPP) also provided information and materials in development of the privacy controls [89].

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.19 introduce each of the SP 800-53 control families and privacy controls,
provide background information on the control family, as well as any ICS guidance and implementation
considerations for ICS owners. ICS-specific recommendations and guidance, if available, is provided in
an outlined box for each section. Much of the ICS-specific guidance was derived from ISA-62443 [34]
and the EPRI report: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems Security Guide [62].
6.2.1

Access Control

The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Access Control (AC) family provide policies
and procedures for specifying the use of system resources by only authorized users, programs, processes,
or other systems. This family specifies controls for managing information system accounts, including
establishing, activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts. Controls cover access
and flow enforcement issues such as separation of duties, least privilege, unsuccessful login attempts,
system use notification, previous logon notification, concurrent session control, session lock, and session
termination. There are also controls to address the use of portable and remote devices and personally
owned information systems to access the information system as well as the use of remote access
capabilities and the implementation of wireless technologies. Access can take several forms, including
viewing, using, and altering specific data or device functions.
Supplemental guidance for the AC controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication [53].
 NIST SP 800-48 provides guidance on wireless network security with particular emphasis on the
IEEE 802.11b and Bluetooth standards 0.
 NIST SP 800-97 provides guidance on IEEE 802.11i wireless network security [64].
 FIPS 201 provides requirements for the personal identity verification of federal employees and
contractors [65].
 NIST SP 800-96 provides guidance on PIV card to reader interoperability [66].
 NIST SP 800-73 provides guidance on interfaces for personal identity verification [49].
 NIST SP 800-76 provides guidance on biometrics for personal identity verification [50].
 NIST SP 800-78 provides guidance on cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for personal identity
verification [67].
If the new federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) is used as an identification token, the access
control system should conform to the requirements of FIPS 201 and NIST SP 800-73 and employ either
cryptographic verification or biometric verification. When token-based access control employs
cryptographic verification, the access control system should conform to the requirements of NIST SP
800-78. When token-based access control employs biometric verification, the access control system
should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-76.
Access control technologies are filter and blocking technologies designed to direct and regulate the flow
of information between devices or systems once authorization has been determined. The following
sections present several access control technologies and their use with ICS.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

6.2.1.1 Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC is a technology that has the potential to reduce the complexity and cost of security administration
in networks with large numbers of intelligent devices. Under RBAC, security administration is simplified
through the use of roles, hierarchies, and constraints to organize user access levels. RBAC reduces costs
within an organization because it accepts that employees change roles and responsibilities more
frequently than the duties within roles and responsibilities.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
RBAC can be used to provide a uniform means to manage access to ICS devices while reducing the
cost of maintaining individual device access levels and minimizing errors. RBAC should be used to
restrict ICS user privileges to only those that are required to perform each person’s job (i.e.,
configuring each role based on the principle of least privilege). The level of access can take several
forms, including viewing, using, and altering specific ICS data or device functions.
RBAC tools can set, modify, or remove authorizations in applications, but they do not replace the
authorization mechanism; they do not check and authenticate users every time a user wants to access an
application. RBAC tools offer interfaces to authorization mechanisms for most current platforms in the
IT arena. However, legacy ICS systems or specialized ICS equipment may require development of
specialized interface software. This issue is a large problem for ICS that use a number of proprietary
operating systems or customized operating system implementations and interfaces.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

6.2.1.2 Web Servers
Web and Internet technologies are being added to a wide variety of ICS products because they make
information more accessible and products more user-friendly and easier to configure remotely. However,
they may also add cyber risks and create new security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
SCADA and historian software vendors typically provide Web servers as a product option so that users
outside the control room can access ICS information. In many cases, software components such as
ActiveX controls or Java applets must be installed or downloaded onto each client machine accessing
the Web server. Some products, such as PLCs and other control devices, are available with embedded
Web, FTP, and email servers to make them easier to configure remotely and allow them to generate
email notifications and reports when certain conditions occur. When feasible, use HTTPS rather than
HTTP, use SFTP or SCP rather than FTP, block inbound FTP and email traffic, etc. Security appliances
(or gateways) are beginning to appear with application proxies able to examine Web, FTP, and email
traffic to block attacks and prevent downloading of ActiveX® controls or Java® applets.
Unless there is substantial benefit to connecting ICSs to the Internet, the systems are best left not
connected.

6.2.1.3 Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
VLANs divide physical networks into smaller logical networks to increase performance, improve
manageability, and simplify network design. VLANs are achieved through configuration of Ethernet
switches. Each VLAN consists of a single broadcast domain that isolates traffic from other VLANs. Just
as replacing hubs with switches reduces collisions, using VLANs limits the broadcast traffic, as well as
allowing logical subnets to span multiple physical locations. There are two categories of VLANs:
 Static, often referred to as port-based, where switch ports are assigned to a VLAN so that it is
transparent to the end user.
 Dynamic, where an end device negotiates VLAN characteristics with the switch or determines the
VLAN based on the IP or hardware addresses.
Although more than one IP subnet may coexist on the same VLAN, the general recommendation is to use
a one-to-one relationship between subnets and VLANs. This practice requires the use of a router or multilayer switch to join multiple VLANs. Many routers and firewalls support tagged frames so that a single
physical interface can be used to route between multiple logical networks.
VLANs are not typically deployed to address host or network vulnerabilities in the way that firewalls or
IDS are deployed. However, when properly configured, VLANs do allow switches to enforce security
policies and segregate traffic at the Ethernet layer. Properly segmented networks can also mitigate the
risks of broadcast storms that may result from port scanning or worm activity.
Switches have been susceptible to attacks such as MAC spoofing, table overflows, and attacks against the
spanning tree protocols, depending on the device and its configuration. VLAN hopping, the ability for an
attack to inject frames to unauthorized ports, has been demonstrated using switch spoofing or doubleencapsulated frames. These attacks cannot be conducted remotely and require local physical access to the
switch. A variety of features such as MAC address filtering, port-based authentication using IEEE 802.1x,

6-10

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

and specific vendor recommended practices can be used to mitigate these attacks, depending on the
device and implementation.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
VLANs have been effectively deployed in ICS networks, with each automation cell assigned to a single
VLAN to limit unnecessary traffic flooding and allow network devices on the same VLAN to span
multiple switches [34].

6.2.1.4 Dial-up Modems
ICS systems have stringent reliability and availability requirements. When there is a need to troubleshoot
and repair, the technical resources may not be physically located at the control room or facility.
Therefore, ICS often use modems to enable vendors, system integrators, or control engineers maintaining
the system to dial in and diagnose, repair, configure, and perform maintenance on the network or
component. While this allows easy access for authorized personnel, if the dial-up modems are not
properly secured, they can also provide backdoor entries for unauthorized use.
Dial-up often uses remote control software that gives the remote user powerful (administrative or root)
access to the target system. Such software usually has security options that should be carefully reviewed
and configured.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
 Consider using callback systems when dial-up modems are installed in an ICS. This ensures that a
dialer is an authorized user by having the modem establish the working connection based on the
dialer’s information and a callback number stored in the ICS approved authorized user list.
 Ensure that default passwords have been changed and strong passwords are in place for each
modem.
 Physically identify modems in use to the control room operators.
 Configure remote control software to use unique user names and passwords, strong authentication,
encryption if determined appropriate, and audit logs. Use of this software by remote users should
be monitored on an almost real-time frequency.
 If feasible, disconnect modems when not in use or consider automating this disconnection process
by having modems disconnect after being on for a given amount of time. It should be noted that
sometimes modem connections are part of the legal support service agreement with the vendor
(e.g., 24x7 support with 15 minute response time). Personnel should be aware that
disconnecting/removing the modems may require that contracts be renegotiated.

6.2.1.5 Wireless
The use of wireless within an ICS is a risk-based decision that has to be determined by the organization.
Generally, wireless LANs should only be deployed where health, safety, environmental, and financial
implications are low. NIST SP 800-48 and SP 800-97 provide guidance on wireless network security.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Wireless LANs
 Prior to installation, a wireless survey should be performed to determine antenna location and
strength to minimize exposure of the wireless network. The survey should take into account the
fact that attackers can use powerful directional antennas, which extend the effective range of a
wireless LAN beyond the expected standard range. Faraday cages and other methods are also
available to minimize exposure of the wireless network outside of the designated areas.
 Wireless users’ access should utilize IEEE 802.1x authentication using a secure authentication
protocol (e.g., Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP] with TLS [EAP-TLS]) that authenticates
users via a user certificates or a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server.
 The wireless access points and data servers for wireless worker devices should be located on an
isolated network with documented and minimal (single if possible) connections to the ICS network.
 Wireless access points should be configured to have a unique service set identifier (SSID), disable
SSID broadcast, and enable MAC filtering at a minimum.
 Wireless devices, if being utilized in a Microsoft Windows ICS network, should be configured into
a separate organizational unit of the Windows domain.
 Wireless device communications should be encrypted and integrity-protected. The encryption must
not degrade the operational performance of the end device. Encryption at OSI Layer 2 should be
considered, rather than at Layer 3 to reduce encryption latency. The use of hardware accelerators to
perform cryptographic functions should also be considered.
For mesh networks, consider the use of broadcast key versus public key management implemented at
OSI Layer 2 to maximize performance. Asymmetric cryptography should be used to perform
administrative functions, and symmetric encryption should be used to secure each data stream as well
as network control traffic. An adaptive routing protocol should be considered if the devices are to be
used for wireless mobility. The convergence time of the network should be as fast as possible
supporting rapid network recovery in the event of a failure or power loss. The use of a mesh network
may provide fault tolerance thru alternate route selection and pre-emptive fail-over of the network.
Wireless field networks
The ISA10020 Committee is working to establish standards, recommended practices, technical reports,
and related information that will define procedures for implementing wireless systems in the
automation and control environment with a focus on the field level (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4). Guidance is
directed towards those responsible for the complete life cycle including the designing, implementing,
on-going maintenance, scalability or managing industrial automation and control systems, and applies
to users, system integrators, practitioners, and control systems manufacturers and vendors.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Awareness and Training

The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Awareness and Training (AT) family provide
policy and procedures for ensuring that all users of an information system are provided basic information
system security awareness and training materials before authorization to access the system is granted.
Personnel training must be monitored and documented.
Supplemental guidance for the AT controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-50 provides guidance on security awareness training [61].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].

ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
For the ICS environment, this must include control system-specific information security awareness and
training for specific ICS applications. In addition, an organization must identify, document, and train
all personnel having significant ICS roles and responsibilities. Awareness and training must cover the
physical process being controlled as well as the ICS.
Security awareness is a critical part of ICS incident prevention, particularly when it comes to social
engineering threats. Social engineering is a technique used to manipulate individuals into giving away
private information, such as passwords. This information can then be used to compromise otherwise
secure systems.
Implementing an ICS security program may bring changes to the way in which personnel access
computer programs, applications, and the computer desktop itself. Organizations should design
effective training programs and communication vehicles to help employees understand why new access
and control methods are required, ideas they can use to reduce risks, and the impact on the organization
if control methods are not incorporated. Training programs also demonstrate management’s
commitment to, and the value of, a cybersecurity program. Feedback from staff exposed to this type of
training can be a valuable source of input for refining the charter and scope of the security program.

6.2.3

Audit and Accountability

An audit is an independent review and examination of records and activities to assess the adequacy of
system controls, to ensure compliance with established policies and operational procedures, and to
recommend necessary changes in controls, policies, or procedures. The security controls that fall within
the NIST SP 800-53 Audit and Accountability (AU) family provide policies and procedures for
generating audit records, their content, capacity, and retention requirements. The controls also provide
safeguards to react to problems such as an audit failure or audit log capacity being reached. Audit data
should be protected from modification and be designed with non-repudiation capability.
Supplemental guidance for the AU controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-61 provides guidance on computer security incident handling and audit log retention
[59].

6-13

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 NIST SP 800-92 provides guidance on log management (including audit logs) [68].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
It is necessary to determine that the system is performing as intended. Periodic audits of the ICS should
be performed to validate the following items:
 The security controls present during system validation testing (e.g., factory acceptance testing and
site acceptance testing) are still installed and operating correctly in the production system.
 The production system is free from security compromises and provides information on the nature
and extent of compromises as feasible, should they occur.
 The management of change program is being rigorously followed with an audit trail of reviews and
approvals for all changes.
The results from each periodic audit should be expressed in the form of performance against a set of
predefined and appropriate metrics to display security performance and security trends. Security
performance metrics should be sent to the appropriate stakeholders, along with a view of security
performance trends.
Traditionally, the primary basis for audit in IT systems has been recordkeeping. Using appropriate tools
within an ICS environment requires extensive knowledge from an IT professional familiar with the
ICS, critical production and safety implications for the facility. Many of the process control devices
that are integrated into the ICS have been installed for many years and do not have the capability to
provide the audit records described in this section. Therefore, the applicability of these more modern
tools for auditing system and network activity is dependent upon the capabilities of the components in
the ICS.
The critical tasks in managing a network in an ICS environment are ensuring reliability and availability
to support safe and efficient operation. In regulated industries, regulatory compliance can add
complexity to security and authentication management, registry and installation integrity management,
and all functions that can augment an installation and operational qualification exercise. Diligent use of
auditing and log management tools can provide valuable assistance in maintaining and proving the
integrity of the ICS from installation through the system life cycle. The value of these tools in this
environment can be calculated by the effort required to re-qualify or otherwise retest the ICS where the
integrity due to attack, accident, or error is in question. The system should provide reliable,
synchronized time stamps in support of the audit tools.
Monitoring of sensors, logs, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), antivirus, patch management, policy
management software, and other security mechanisms should be done on a real-time basis where
feasible. A first-line monitoring service would receive alarms, do rapid initial problem determination
and take action to alert appropriate facility personnel to intervene.
System auditing utilities should be incorporated into new and existing ICS projects. These auditing
utilities should be tested (e.g., off-line on a comparable ICS) before being deployed on an operational
ICS. These tools can provide tangible records of evidence and system integrity. Additionally, active log
management utilities may actually flag an attack or event in progress and provide location and tracing
information to help respond to the incident [34].

6-14

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

There should be a method for tracing all console activities to a user, either manually (e.g., control room
sign in) or automatic (e.g., login at the application and/or OS layer). Policies and procedures for what is
logged, how the logs are stored (or printed), how they are protected, who has access to the logs and
how/when are they reviewed should be developed. These policies and procedures will vary with the
ICS application and platform. Legacy systems typically employ printer loggers, which are reviewed by
administrative, operational, and security staff. Logs maintained by the ICS application may be stored at
various locations and may or may not be encrypted.

6.2.4

Security Assessment and Authorization

The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Assessment and Authorization (CA) family
provide the basis for performing periodic assessments and providing certification of the security controls
implemented in the information system to determine if the controls are implemented correctly, operating
as intended, and producing the desired outcome to meet the system security requirements. A senior
organizational official is responsible for accepting residual risk and authorizing system operation. These
steps constitute accreditation. In addition, all security controls should be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Monitoring activities include configuration management and control of information system components,
security impact analysis of changes to the system, ongoing assessment of security controls, and status
reporting.
Supplemental guidance for the CA controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-53A provides guidance on security control assessments [23].
 NIST SP 800-37 provides guidance defining the information system boundary and security
certification and accreditation of the information system [21].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
6.2.5

Configuration Management

Configuration management policy and procedures are used to control modifications to hardware,
firmware, software, and documentation to ensure that the information system is protected against
improper modifications prior to, during, and after system implementation. The security controls that fall
within the NIST SP 800-53 Configuration Management (CM) family provide policy and procedures for
establishing baseline controls for information systems. Controls are also specified for maintaining,
monitoring, and documenting configuration control changes. There should be restricted access to
configuration settings, and security settings of IT products should be set to the most restrictive mode
consistent with ICS operational requirements.
Supplemental guidance for the CM controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-70 provides guidance on configuration settings for IT products [26].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
 NIST SP 800-128 provides guidance on implementation of a security-focused configuration
management program [80].

6-15

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
A formal change management program should be established and procedures used to insure that all
modifications to an ICS network meet the same security requirements as the original components
identified in the asset evaluation and the associated risk assessment and mitigation plans. Risk
assessment should be performed on all changes to the ICS network that could affect security, including
configuration changes, the addition of network components, and installation of software. Changes to
policies and procedures may also be required. The current ICS network configuration and device
configurations must always be known and documented.

6.2.6

Contingency Planning

Contingency plans are designed to maintain or restore business operations, including computer
operations, possibly at an alternate location, in the event of emergencies, system failures, or disaster. The
security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Contingency Planning (CP) family provide policies
and procedures to implement a contingency plan by specifying roles and responsibilities, and assigning
personnel and activities associated with restoring the information system after a disruption or failure.
Along with planning, controls also exist for contingency training, testing, and plan update, and for backup
information processing and storage sites.
Supplemental guidance for the CP controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-34 provides guidance on contingency planning [52].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Contingency plans should cover the full range of failures or problems that could be caused by cyber
incidents. Contingency plans should include procedures for restoring systems from known valid
backups, separating systems from all non-essential interferences and connections that could permit
cybersecurity intrusions, and alternatives to achieve necessary interfaces and coordination. Employees
should be trained and familiar with the contents of the contingency plans. Contingency plans should be
periodically reviewed with employees responsible for restoration of the ICS, and tested to ensure that
they continue to meet their objectives. Organizations also have business continuity plans and disaster
recovery plans that are closely related to contingency plans. Because business continuity and disaster
recovery plans are particularly important for ICS, they are described in more detail in the sections to
follow.
6.2.6.1 Business Continuity Planning
Business continuity planning addresses the overall issue of maintaining or reestablishing production in the
case of an interruption. These interruptions may take the form of a natural disaster (e.g., hurricane,
tornado, earthquake, flood), an unintentional man-made event (e.g., accidental equipment damage, fire or
explosion, operator error), an intentional man-made event (e.g., attack by bomb, firearm or vandalism,
attacker or virus), or an equipment failure. From a potential outage perspective, this may involve typical
time spans of days, weeks, or months to recover from a natural disaster, or minutes or hours to recover
from a malware infection or a mechanical/electrical failure. Because there is often a separate discipline

6-16

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

that deals with reliability and electrical/mechanical maintenance, some organizations choose to define
business continuity in a way that excludes these sources of failure. Because business continuity also deals
primarily with the long-term implications of production outages, some organizations also choose to place
a minimum interruption limit on the risks to be considered. For the purposes of ICS cybersecurity, it is
recommended that neither of these constraints be made. Long-term outages (disaster recovery) and shortterm outages (operational recovery) should both be considered. Because some of these potential
interruptions involve man-made events, it is also important to work collaboratively with the physical
security organization to understand the relative risks of these events and the physical security
countermeasures that are in place to prevent them. It is also important for the physical security
organization to understand which areas of a production site house data acquisition and control systems
that might have higher-level risks.
Before creating a business continuity plan (BCP) to deal with potential outages, it is important to specify
the recovery objectives for the various systems and subsystems involved based on typical business needs.
There are two distinct types of objectives: system recovery and data recovery. System recovery involves
the recovery of communication links and processing capabilities, and it is usually specified in terms of a
Recovery Time Objective (RTO). This is defined as the time required to recover the required
communication links and processing capabilities. Data recovery involves the recovery of data describing
production or product conditions in the past and is usually specified in terms of a Recovery Point
Objective (RPO). This is defined as the longest period of time for which an absence of data can be
tolerated.
Once the recovery objectives are defined, a list of potential interruptions should be created and the
recovery procedure developed and described. For most of the smaller scale interruptions, repair and
replace activities based on a critical spares inventory will prove adequate to meet the recovery objectives.
When this is not true, contingency plans need to be developed. Due to the potential cost and importance
of these contingency plans, they should be reviewed with the managers responsible for business
continuity planning to verify that they are justified. Once the recovery procedures are documented, a
schedule should be developed to test part or all of the recovery procedures. Particular attention must be
paid to the verification of backups of system configuration data and product or production data. Examples
of system configuration data include computer configuration backups, application configuration backups,
operational control limits, control bands and setpoints for pre-incident operation for all ICS
programmable equipment. Not only should these be tested when they are produced, but the procedures
followed for their storage should also be reviewed periodically to verify that the backups are kept in
environmental conditions that will not render them unusable and that they are kept in a secure location, so
they can be quickly obtained by authorized individuals when needed.

6-17

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

6.2.6.2 Disaster Recovery Planning
A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a documented process or set of procedures to recover and protect an IT
infrastructure in the event of a disaster. The DRP, ordinarily documented in written form, specifies
procedures an organization is to follow in the event of a disaster. It is a comprehensive statement of
consistent actions to be taken before, during and after a disaster. The disaster could be natural,
environmental or man-made. Man-made disasters could be intentional or unintentional.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
A DRP is essential to continued availability of the ICS. The DRP should include the following items:
 Required response to events or conditions of varying duration and severity that would activate the
recovery plan.
 Procedures for operating the ICS in manual mode with all external electronic connections severed
until secure conditions can be restored.
 Roles and responsibilities of responders.
 Processes and procedures for the backup and secure storage of information.
 Complete and up-to-date logical network diagram.
 Personnel list for authorized physical and cyber access to the ICS.
 Communication procedure and list of personnel to contact in the case of an emergency including
ICS vendors, network administrators, ICS support personnel, etc.
 Current configuration information for all components.
 Schedule for exercising the DRP.
The plan should also indicate requirements for the timely replacement of components in the case of an
emergency. If possible, replacements for hard-to-obtain critical components should be kept in
inventory.
The security plan should define a comprehensive backup and restore policy. In formulating this policy,
the following should be considered:
 The speed at which data or the system must be restored. This requirement may justify the need for
a redundant system, spare offline computer, or valid file system backups.
 The frequency at which critical data and configurations are changing. This will dictate the
frequency and completeness of backups.
 The safe onsite and offsite storage of full and incremental backups.
 The safe storage of installation media, license keys, and configuration information.
 Identification of individuals responsible for performing, testing, storing, and restoring backups.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Identification and Authentication

Authentication describes the process of positively identifying potential network users, hosts, applications,
services, and resources using a combination of identification factors or credentials. The result of this
authentication process then becomes the basis for permitting or denying further actions (e.g., when an
automatic teller machine asks for a PIN). Based on the authentication determination, the system may or
may not allow the potential user access to its resources. Authorization is the process of determining who
and what should be allowed to have access to a particular resource; access control is the mechanism for
enforcing authorization. Access control is described in Section 6.2.1.
There are several possible factors for determining the authenticity of a person, device, or system,
including something you know, something you have or something you are. For example, authentication
could be based on something known (e.g., PIN number or password), something possessed (e.g., key,
dongle, smart card), something you are such as a biological characteristic (e.g., fingerprint, retinal
signature), a location (e.g., Global Positioning System [GPS] location access), the time a request is made,
or a combination of these attributes. In general, the more factors that are used in the authentication
process, the more robust the process will be. When two or more factors are used, the process is known
generically as multi-factor authentication.
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Identification and Authentication (IA) family
provide policy and guidance for the identification and authentication of users of and devices within the
information system. These include controls to manage identifiers and authenticators within each
technology used (e.g., tokens, certificates, biometrics, passwords, key cards).
Supplemental guidance for the IA controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication [53].
 NIST SP 800-73 provides guidance on interfaces for personal identity verification [49].
 NIST SP 800-76 provides guidance on biometrics for personal identity verification [50].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Computer systems in ICS environments typically rely on traditional passwords for authentication.
Control system suppliers often supply systems with default passwords. These passwords are factory set
and are often easy to guess or are changed infrequently, which creates additional security risks. Also,
protocols currently used in ICS environments generally have inadequate or no network service
authentication. There are now several forms of authentication available in addition to traditional
password techniques being used with ICS. Some of these, including password authentication, are
presented in the following sections with discussions regarding their use with ICS.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

6.2.7.1 Password Authentication
Password authentication technologies determine authenticity based on testing for something the device or
human requesting access should know, such as a PIN number or password. Password authentication
schemes are thought of as the simplest and most common forms of authentication.
Password vulnerabilities can be reduced by using an active password checker that prohibits weak,
recently used, or commonly used passwords. Another weakness is the ease of third-party eavesdropping.
Passwords typed at a keyboard are easily observed or recorded, especially in areas where adversaries
could plant tiny wireless cameras or keystroke loggers. Network service authentication often transmits
passwords as plaintext (unencrypted), allowing any network capture tool to expose the passwords.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
One problem with passwords unique to the ICS environment is that a user’s ability to recall and enter a
password may be impacted by the stress of the moment. During a major crisis when human
intervention is critically required to control the process, an operator may panic and have difficulty
remembering or entering the password and either be locked out completely or be delayed in responding
to the event. If the password has been entered wrong and the system has a limit on allowed wrong
password entries, the operator may be locked out permanently until an authorized employee can reset
the account. Biometric identifiers may have similar drawbacks. Organizations should carefully consider
the security needs and the potential ramifications of the use of authentication mechanisms on these
critical systems.
In situations where the ICS cannot support, or the organization determines it is not advisable (e.g.,
performance, safety, or reliability are adversely impacted), to implement authentication mechanisms in
an ICS, the organization uses compensating controls, such as rigorous physical security controls (e.g.,
control center keycard access for authorized users) to provide an equivalent security capability or level
of protection for the ICS. This guidance also applies to the use of session lock and session termination
in an ICS.
Special consideration must be made when pushing down policies based on login password
authentication within the ICS environment. Without an exclusion list based on machine identification
(ID), non-operator logon can result in policies being pushed down such as auto- logoff timeout and
administrator password replacement that can be detrimental to the operation of the system.
Some ICS operating systems make setting secure passwords difficult, as the password size is very small
and the system allows only group passwords at each level of access, not individual passwords. Some
industrial (and Internet) protocols transmit passwords in plaintext, making them susceptible to
interception. In cases where this practice cannot be avoided, it is important that users have different
(and unrelated) passwords for use with encrypted and non-encrypted protocols.
The following are general recommendations and considerations with regards to the use of passwords.
 The length, strength, and complexity of passwords should balance security and operational ease of
access within the capabilities of the software and underlying OS.
 Passwords should have appropriate length and complexity for the required security. In particular,
they should not be able to be found in a dictionary or contain predictable sequences of numbers or
letters.

6-20

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Passwords should be used with care on operator interface devices such as control consoles on
critical processes. Using passwords on these consoles could introduce potential safety issues if
operators are locked out or delayed access during critical events. Physical security should
supplement operator control consoles when password protection is not feasible.
 The keeper of master passwords should be a trusted employee, available during emergencies. Any
copies of the master passwords must be stored in a very secure location with limited access.
 The passwords of privileged users (such as network technicians, electrical or electronics
technicians and management, and network designers/operators) should be most secure and be
changed frequently. Authority to change master passwords should be limited to trusted employees.
A password audit record, especially for master passwords, should be maintained separately from
the control system.
 In environments with a high risk of interception or intrusion (such as remote operator interfaces in
a facility that lacks local physical security access controls), organizations should consider
supplementing password authentication with other forms of authentication such as multi-factor
authentication using biometric or physical tokens.
 For user authentication purposes, password use is common and generally acceptable for users
logging directly into a local device or computer. Passwords should not be sent across any network
unless protected by some form of FIPS-approved encryption or salted cryptographic hash
specifically designed to prevent replay attacks. It is assumed that the device used to enter a
password is connected to the network in a secure manner.
 For network service authentication purposes, passwords should not be passed as plain text. There
are more secure alternatives available, such as challenge/response or public key authentication.

6.2.7.2 Challenge/response Authentication
Challenge/response authentication requires that both the service requester and service provider know a
“secret” code in advance. When service is requested, the service provider sends a random number or
string as a challenge to the service requester. The service requester uses the secret code to generate a
unique response for the service provider. If the response is as expected, it proves that the service requester
has access to the “secret” without ever exposing the secret on the network.
Challenge/response authentication addresses the security vulnerabilities of traditional password
authentication. When passwords (hashed or plain) are sent across a network, a portion of the actual
“secret” itself is being sent, giving the secret to the remote device performs authentication. Therefore,
traditional password exchange always suffers the risk of discovery or replay. Because the secret is known
in advance and never sent in challenge/response systems, the risk of discovery is eliminated. If the service
provider can never send the same challenge twice, and the receiver can detect all duplications, the risks of
network capture and replay attacks are eliminated.

6-21

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
For User Authentication, the direct use of challenge/response authentication may not be feasible for
control system due to the possible latency that may be introduced in the necessary fast dynamics
required for access to a control system or industrial network. For Network Service Authentication, the
use of challenge/response authentication is preferable to more traditional password or source identity
authentication schemes.
Challenge/response authentication provides more security than encrypted passwords for user
authentication across a network. Managing master encryption algorithms and master passwords
becomes increasing more complex as more parties are involved in the security processes and is an
important consideration in the robustness of the security scheme.

6.2.7.3 Physical Token Authentication
Physical or token authentication is similar to password authentication, except that these technologies
determine authenticity by testing for secret code or key produced by a device or token the person
requesting access has in their possession, such as security tokens or smart cards. Increasingly, private
keys are being embedded in physical devices such as USB dongles. Some tokens support single-factor
authentication only, so that simply having possession of the token is sufficient to be authenticated. Others
support multi-factor authentication that requires knowledge of a PIN or password in addition to
possessing the token.
The primary vulnerability that token authentication addresses is easily duplicating a secret code or sharing
it with others. It eliminates the all-too-common scenario of a password to a “secure” system being left on
the wall next to a PC or operator station. The security token cannot be duplicated without special access
to equipment and supplies.
A second benefit is that the secret within a physical token can be very large, physically secure, and
randomly generated. Because it is embedded in metal or silicon, it does not have the same risks that
manually entered passwords do. If a security token is lost or stolen, the authorized user loses access,
unlike traditional passwords that can be lost or stolen without notice.
Common forms of physical/token authentication include:
 Traditional physical lock and keys.
 Security cards (e.g., magnetic, smart chip, optical coding).
 Radio frequency devices in the form of cards, key fobs, or mounted tags.
 Dongles with secure encryption keys that attach to the USB, serial, or parallel ports of computers.
 One-time authentication code generators (e.g., key fobs).
For single-factor authentication, the largest weakness is that physically holding the token means access is
granted (e.g., anyone finding a set of lost keys now has access to whatever they open). Physical/token
authentication is more secure when combined with a second form of authentication, such as a memorized
PIN used along with the token.

6-22

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Multi-factor authentication is an accepted good practice for access to ICS applications from outside the
ICS firewall.
Physical/token authentication has the potential for a strong role in ICS environments. An access card or
other token can be an effective form of authentication for computer access, as long as the computer is
in a secure area (e.g., once the operator has gained access to the room with appropriate secondary
authentication, the card alone can be used to enable control actions).

6.2.7.4 Smart Card Authentication
Smart cards are similar to token authentication, but can provide additional functionality. Smart cards can
be configured to run multiple on-board applications to support building access, computer dual-factor or
triple-factor authentication and cashless vending on a single card, while also acting as the company photo
ID for the individual.
Typically, smart cards come in a credit card size form-factor that can be printed, embossed, and
individually personalized. Smart cards can be customized, individualized, and issued in-house or
outsourced to service providers who typically issue hundreds of thousands of cards per day.
Smart cards enhance software-only solutions, such as password authentication, by offering an additional
authentication factor and removing the human element in memorizing complex secrets. They also:
 Isolate security-critical computations, involving authentication, digital signatures, and key exchange
from other parts of the system that do not have a need to know.
 Enable portability of credentials and other private information between multiple computer systems.
 Provide tamper-resistant storage for protecting private keys and other forms of personal information.
The majority of issues are logistical around issuing the cards, particularly to replace lost or stolen cards.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Although smart cards are relatively inexpensive and offer useful functionality in an industrial control
system context, their implementation must be done within the overall security context of the plant. The
necessary identification of individuals, issuance of cards, revocation should compromise be suspected,
and the assignment of authorizations to authenticated identities, represents a significant initial and ongoing challenge. In some cases corporate IT or other resources may be available to assist in the
deployment of smart card and public key based infrastructures.
If smart cards are implemented in an industrial control setting, provisions for management of lost or
damaged cards should be considered, as well as the costs to incorporate a respective access control
system and provide a management process for card distribution and retrieval.

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

6.2.7.5 Biometric Authentication
Biometric authentication technologies determine authenticity by determining presumably unique
biological characteristics of the human requesting access. Usable biometric features include finger
minutiae, facial geometry, retinal and iris signatures, voice patterns, typing patterns, and hand geometry.
Like physical tokens and smart cards, biometric authentication enhances software-only solutions, such as
password authentication, by offering an additional authentication factor and removing the human element
in memorizing complex secrets. In addition, because biometric characteristics are unique to a given
individual, biometric authentication addresses the issues of lost or stolen physical tokens and smart cards.
Noted issues with biometric authentication include:
 Distinguishing a real object from a fake (e.g., how to distinguish a real human finger from a siliconrubber cast of one or a real human voice from a recorded one).
 Generating type-I and type-II errors (the probability of rejecting a valid biometric image, and the
probability of accepting an invalid biometric image, respectively). Biometric authentication devices
should be configured to the lowest crossover between these two probabilities, also known as the
crossover error rate.
 Handling environmental factors such as temperature and humidity to which some biometric devices
are sensitive.
 Addressing industrial applications where employees may have on safety glasses and/or gloves and
industrial chemicals may impact biometric scanners.
 Retraining biometric scanners that occasionally “drift” over time. Human biometric traits may also
shift over time, necessitating periodic scanner retraining.
 Requiring face-to-face technical support and verification for device training, unlike a password that
can be given over a phone or an access card that can be handed out by a receptionist.
 Denying needed access to the control system because of a temporary inability of the sensing device to
acknowledge a legitimate user.
 Being socially acceptable. Users consider some biometric authentication devices more acceptable
than others. For example, retinal scans may be considered very low on the scale of acceptability,
while thumb print scanners may be considered high on the scale of acceptability. Users of biometric
authentication devices will need to take social acceptability for their target group into consideration
when selecting among various biometric authentication technologies.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Biometric devices make a useful secondary check versus other forms of authentication that can become
lost or borrowed. Using biometric authentication in combination with token-based access control or
badge-operated employee time clocks increases the security level. A possible application is in a control
room that is environmentally controlled and physically secured [34].
Biometrics can provide a valuable authentication mechanism, but need to be carefully assessed for
industrial applications because physical and environmental issues within the installation environment
may need to be restructured for reliable authorized authentication. The exact physical and environmental
properties of an installation should be coordinated with a system vendor or manufacturer.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Incident Response

An incident response plan is documentation of a predetermined set of instructions or procedures to detect,
respond to, and limit consequences of incidents against an organization’s information systems. Response
should be measured first and foremost against the “service being provided,” not just the system that was
compromised. If an incident is discovered, there should be a quick risk assessment performed to evaluate
the effect of both the attack and the options to respond. For example, one possible response option is to
physically isolate the system under attack. However, this may have such a dire impact on the service that
it is dismissed as not viable.
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Incident Response (IR) family provide policies
and procedures for incident response monitoring, handling, and reporting. The handling of a security
incident includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. Controls
also cover incident response training for personnel and testing the incident response capability for an
information system.
Supplemental guidance for the IR controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-61 provides guidance on incident handling and reporting [59].
 NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on malware incident prevention and handling [60].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27] .

ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Regardless of the steps taken to protect an ICS, it is always possible that it may be compromised by an
intentional or unintentional incident. The following symptoms can arise from normal network
problems, but when several symptoms start to appear, a pattern may indicate the ICS is under attack
and may be worth investigating further. If the adversary is skilled, it may not be very obvious that an
attack is underway.
The symptoms of an incident could include any of the following:
 Unusually heavy network traffic.
 Out of disk space or significantly reduced free disk space.
 Unusually high CPU usage.
 Creation of new user accounts.
 Attempted or actual use of administrator-level accounts.
 Locked-out accounts.
 Account in-use when the user is not at work.
 Cleared log files.
 Full log files with unusually large number of events.

6-25

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Antivirus or IDS alerts.
 Disabled antivirus software and other security controls.
 Unexpected patch changes.
 Machines connecting to outside IP addresses.
 Requests for information about the system (social engineering attempts).
 Unexpected changes in configuration settings.
 Unexpected system shutdown.
To minimize the effects of these intrusions, it is necessary to plan a response. Incident response
planning defines procedures to be followed when an intrusion occurs. NIST SP 800-61 Revision 2,
Computer Security Incident Handling Guide [59], provides guidance on incident response planning,
which might include the following items:
 Classification of Incidents. The various types of ICS incidents should be identified and classified
as to potential impact so that a proper response can be formulated for each potential incident.
 Response Actions. There are several responses that can be taken in the event of an incident. These
range from doing nothing to full system shutdown (although full shutdown of an ICS is a highly
unlikely response). The response taken will depend on the type of incident and its effect on the ICS
system and the physical process being controlled. A written plan documenting the types of
incidents and the response to each type should be prepared. This will provide guidance during
times when there might be confusion or stress due to the incident. This plan should include step-bystep actions to be taken by the various organizations. If there are reporting requirements, these
should be noted as well as where the report should be made and phone numbers to reduce reporting
confusion.
 Recovery Actions. The results of the intrusion could be minor, or the intrusion could cause many
problems in the ICS. Risk analysis should be conducted to determine the sensitivity of the physical
system being controlled to failure modes in the ICS. In each case, step-by-step recovery actions
should be documented so that the system can be returned to normal operations as quickly and
safely as possible. Recovery actions for an intrusion that affects operation of the ICS will closely
align with the system's Disaster Recovery Plan, and should take into account the planning and
coordination already established.
During the preparation of the incident response plan, input should be obtained from the various
stakeholders including operations, engineering, IT, system support vendors, management, organized
labor, legal, and safety. These stakeholders should also review and approve the plan.

Maintenance

The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Maintenance (MA) family provide policy and
procedure for performing routine and preventative maintenance on the components of an information
system. This includes the usage of maintenance tools (both local and remote) and management of
maintenance personnel.
Supplemental guidance for the MA controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-63 provides guidance on electronic authentication for remote maintenance [53].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
6.2.10 Media Protection
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Media Protection (MP) family provide policies
and procedures for limiting the access to media to authorized users. Controls also exist for labeling media
for distribution and handling requirements, as well as storage, transport, sanitization (removal of
information from digital media), destruction, and disposal of the media.
Supplemental guidance for the MP controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-88 provides guidance on appropriate sanitization equipment, techniques, and
procedures [78].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Media assets include removable media and devices such as floppy disks, CDs, DVDs and USB
memory sticks, as well as printed reports and documents. Physical security controls should address
specific requirements for the safe and secure maintenance of these assets and provide specific guidance
for transporting, handling, and erasing or destroying these assets. Security requirements could include
safe storage from loss, fire, theft, unintentional distribution, or environmental damage.
If an adversary gains access to backup media associated with an ICS, it could provide valuable data for
launching an attack. Recovering an authentication file from the backups might allow an adversary to
run password cracking tools and extract usable passwords. In addition, the backups typically contain
machine names, IP addresses, software version numbers, usernames, and other data useful in planning
an attack.
The use of any unauthorized CDs, DVDs, floppy disks, USB memory sticks, or similar removable
media on any node that is part of or connected to the ICS should not be permitted in order to prevent
the introduction of malware or the inadvertent loss or theft of data. Where the system components use
unmodified industry standard protocols, mechanized policy management software can be used to
enforce media protection policy.

6.2.11 Physical and Environmental Protection
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
family provide policy and procedures for all physical access to an information system including
designated entry/exit points, transmission media, and display media. These include controls for
monitoring physical access, maintaining logs, and handling visitors. This family also includes controls for
the deployment and management of emergency protection controls such as emergency shutdown of the IT
system, backup for power and lighting, controls for temperature and humidity, and protection against fire
and water damage.
Supplemental guidance for the PE controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-46 provides guidance on telecommuting and broadband communication security [51].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
Physical security measures are designed to reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate loss or damage to
plant assets and the surrounding environment. The assets being safeguarded may be physical assets such
as tools and plant equipment, the environment, the surrounding community, and intellectual property,
including proprietary data such as process settings and customer information. The deployment of physical
security controls is often subject to environmental, safety, regulatory, legal, and other requirements that
must be identified and addressed specific to a given environment. The subject of deploying physical
security controls is vast and needs to be specific to the type of protection needed.

ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
The physical protection of the cyber components and data associated with the ICS must be addressed as
part of the overall security of a plant. Security at many ICS facilities is closely tied to plant safety. A
primary goal is to keep people out of hazardous situations without preventing them from doing their job
or carrying out emergency procedures. Physical security controls are any physical measures, either
active or passive, that limit physical access to any information assets in the ICS environment. These
measures are employed to prevent many types of undesirable effects, including:
 Unauthorized physical access to sensitive locations.
 Physical modification, manipulation, theft or other removal, or destruction of existing systems,
infrastructure, communications interfaces, personnel, or physical locations.
 Unauthorized observation of sensitive informational assets through visual observation, note taking,
photographs, or other means.
 Prevention of unauthorized introduction of new systems, infrastructure, communications interfaces,
or other hardware.
 Prevention of unauthorized introduction of devices intentionally designed to cause hardware
manipulation, communications eavesdropping, or other harmful impact.
Gaining physical access to a control room or control system components often implies gaining logical
access to the process control system as well. Likewise, having logical access to systems such as main
servers and control room computers allows an adversary to exercise control over the physical process.

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

If computers are readily accessible, and they have removable media drives (e.g., floppy disks, compact
discs, external hard drives) or USB ports, the drives can be fitted with locks or removed from the
computers and USB ports disabled. Depending on security needs and risks, it might also be prudent to
disable or physically protect power buttons to prevent unauthorized use. For maximum security, servers
should be placed in locked areas and authentication mechanisms (such as keys) protected. Also, the
network devices on the ICS network, including switches, routers, network jacks, servers, workstations,
and controllers, should be located in a secured area that can only be accessed by authorized personnel.
The secured area should also be compatible with the environmental requirements of the devices.
A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should include the following attributes:
 Protection of Physical Locations. Classic physical security considerations typically refer to a
ringed architecture of layered security measures. Creating several physical barriers, both active and
passive, around buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, or other informational assets, establishes
these physical security perimeters. Physical security controls meant to protect physical locations
include fences, anti-vehicle ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, or other
measures. Most organizations include this layered model by preventing access to the plant first by
the use of fences, guard shacks, gates, and locked doors.
 Access Control. Access control systems should ensure that only authorized people have access to
controlled spaces. An access control system should be flexible. The need for access may be based
on time (day vs. night shift), level of training, employment status, work assignment, plant status,
and a myriad of other factors. A system must be able to verify that persons being granted access are
who they say they are (usually using something the person has, such as an access card or key;
something they know, such as a personal identification number (PIN); or something they are, using
a biometric device). Access control should be highly reliable, yet not interfere with the routine or
emergency duties of plant personnel. Integration of access control into the process system allows a
view into not only security access, but also physical and personnel asset tracking, dramatically
accelerating response time in emergencies, helping to direct individuals to safe locations, and
improving overall productivity. Within an area, access to network and computer cabinets should be
limited to only those who have a need, such as network technicians and engineers, or computer
maintenance staff. Equipment cabinets should be locked and wiring should be neat and within
cabinets. Consider keeping all computers in secure racks and using peripheral extender technology
to connect human-machine interfaces to the racked computers.
Access Monitoring Systems. Access monitoring systems include still and video cameras, sensors,
and various types of identification systems. Examples of these systems include cameras that
monitor parking lots, convenience stores, or airline security. These devices do not specifically
prevent access to a particular location; rather, they store and record either the physical presence or
the lack of physical presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other physical entities. Adequate
lighting should be provided based on the type of access monitoring device deployed.
Access Limiting Systems. Access limiting systems may employ a combination of devices to
physically control or prevent access to protected resources. Access limiting systems include both
active and passive security devices such as fences, doors, safes, gates, and guards. They are often
coupled with identification and monitoring systems to provide role-based access for specific
individuals or groups of individuals.
 People and Asset Tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a large installation is important for
safety reasons, and it is increasingly important for security reasons as well. Asset location
technologies can be used to track the movements of people and vehicles within the plant, to ensure
that they stay in authorized areas, to identify personnel needing assistance, and to support
emergency response.

6-29

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Environmental Factors. In addressing the security needs of the system and data, it is important to
consider environmental factors. For example, if a site is dusty, systems should be placed in a
filtered environment. This is particularly important if the dust is likely to be conductive or
magnetic, as in the case of sites that process coal or iron. If vibration is likely to be a problem,
systems should be mounted on rubber bushings to prevent disk crashes and wiring connection
problems. In addition, the environments containing systems and media (e.g., backup tapes, floppy
disks) should have stable temperature and humidity. An alarm to the process control system should
be generated when environmental specifications such as temperature and humidity are exceeded.
 Environmental Control Systems. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for
control rooms must support plant personnel during normal operation and emergency situations,
which could include the release of toxic substances. Fire systems must be carefully designed to
avoid causing more harm than good (e.g., to avoid mixing water with incompatible products).
HVAC and fire systems have significantly increased roles in security that arise from the
interdependence of process control and security. For example, fire prevention and HVAC systems
that support industrial control computers need to be protected against cyber incidents.
 Power. Reliable power for the ICS is essential, so an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) should be
provided. If the site has an emergency generator, the UPS battery life may only need to be a few
seconds; however, if the site relies on external power, the UPS battery life may need to be hours. It
should be sized, at a minimum, so that the system can be shutdown safely.

6.2.11.1 Control Center/Control Room
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Providing physical security for the control center/control room is essential to reduce the potential of
many threats. Control centers/control rooms frequently have consoles continuously logged onto the
primary control server, where speed of response and continual view of the plant is of utmost
importance. These areas will often contain the servers themselves, other critical computer nodes, and
sometimes plant controllers. It is essential that access to these areas be limited to authorized users only,
using authentication methods such as smart or magnetic identity cards or biometric devices. In extreme
cases, it may be considered necessary to make the control center/control room blast-proof, or to provide
an offsite emergency control center/control room so that control can be maintained if the primary
control center/control room becomes uninhabitable.

6.2.11.2 Portable Devices
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Computers and computerized devices used for ICS functions (such as PLC programming) should never
be allowed to leave the ICS area. Laptops, portable engineering workstations and handhelds (e.g., 375
HART communicator) should be tightly secured and should never be allowed to be used outside the
ICS network. Antivirus and patch management should be kept current.

6.2.11.3 Cabling
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Cabling design and implementation for the control network should be addressed in the cybersecurity
plan. Unshielded twisted pair communications cable, while acceptable for the office environment, is
generally not suitable for the plant environment due to its susceptibility to interference from magnetic
fields, radio waves, temperature extremes, moisture, dust, and vibration. Industrial RJ-45 connectors
should be used in place of other types of twisted pair connectors to provide protection against moisture,
dust and vibration. Fiber-optic cable and coaxial cable are often better network cabling choices for the
control network because they are immune to many of the typical environmental conditions including
electrical and radio frequency interference found in an industrial control environment. Cable and
connectors should be color-coded and labeled so that the ICS and IT networks are clearly delineated
and the potential for an inadvertent cross-connect is reduced. Cable runs should be installed so that
access is minimized (i.e., limited to authorized personnel only) and equipment should be installed in
locked cabinets with adequate ventilation and air filtration.

6.2.12 Planning
A security plan is a formal document that provides an overview of the security requirements for an
information system and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those
requirements. The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Planning (PL) family provide the
basis for developing a security plan. These controls also address maintenance issues for periodically
updating a security plan. A set of rules describes user responsibilities and expected behavior regarding
information system usage with provision for signed acknowledgement from users indicating that they
have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior before authorizing access to the
information system.
Supplemental guidance for the PL controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-18 provides guidance on preparing rules of behavior [19].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
A security plan for an ICS should build on appropriate existing IT security experience, programs, and
practices. However, the critical differences between IT and ICS addressed in Section 2.4 will influence
how security will be applied to the ICS. A forward-looking plan is needed to provide a method for
continuous security improvements. Whenever a new system is being designed and installed, it is
imperative to take the time to address security throughout the lifecycle, from architecture to
procurement to installation to maintenance to decommissioning. ICS security is a rapidly evolving field
requiring the security planning process to constantly explore emerging ICS security capabilities as well
as new threats that are identified by organizations such as the ICS-CERT.

6.2.13 Personnel Security
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Personnel Security (PS) family provide policies
and procedures to reduce the risk of human error, theft, fraud, or other intentional or unintentional misuse
of information systems.
Supplemental guidance for the PS controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-35 provides guidance on information technology security services [44].
 NIST SP 800-73 provides guidance on interfaces for personal identity verification [49].
 NIST SP 800-76 provides guidance on biometrics for personal identity verification [50].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
Personnel security measures are meant to reduce the possibility and risk of human error, theft, fraud, or
other intentional or unintentional misuse of informational assets. There are three main aspects to
personnel security:
 Hiring Policies. This includes pre-employment screening such as background checks, the interview
process, employment terms and conditions, complete job descriptions and detailing of duties, terms
and condition of employment, and legal rights and responsibilities of employees or contractors.
 Organization Policies and Practices. These include security policies, information classification,
document and media maintenance and handling policies, user training, acceptable usage policies for
organization assets, periodic employee performance reviews, appropriate background checks, and any
other policies and actions that detail expected and required behavior of organization employees,
contractors, and visitors. Organization policies to be enforced should be written down and readily
available to all workers through an employee handbook, distributed as email notices, located in a
centralized resource area, or posted directly at a worker’s area of responsibility.
 Terms and Conditions of Employment. This category includes job and position responsibilities,
notification to employees of terminable offenses, disciplinary actions and punishments, and periodic
employee performance reviews.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Positions should be categorized with a risk designation and screening criteria, and individuals filling a
position should be screened against this criteria as well as complete an access agreement before being
granted access to an information system. Personnel should be screened for the critical positions
controlling and maintaining the ICS.
Additionally, training programs should be carefully developed to ensure that each employee has
received training relevant and necessary to his job functions. Further, ensure that the employees have
demonstrated their competence in their job functions.

6.2.14 Risk Assessment
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Risk Assessment (RA) family provide policy
and procedures to develop, distribute, and maintain a documented risk assessment policy that describes
purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, and compliance as well as policy implementation procedures. An
information system and associated data is categorized based on the security objectives and a range of risk
levels. A risk assessment is performed to identify risks and the magnitude of harm that could result from
the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of an information system
and data. Also included in these controls are mechanisms for keeping risk assessments up-to-date and
performing periodic testing and vulnerability assessments.
Supplemental guidance for the RA controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-30 provides guidance on conducting risk assessments and updates [79].
 NIST SP 800-39 provides guidance on risk management at all organizational levels [20].
 NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on handling security patches [40].
 NIST SP 800-115 provides guidance on network security testing [41].
 NIST SP 800-60 provides guidance on determining security categories for information types [25].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Organizations must consider the potential consequences resulting from an incident on an ICS. Welldefined policies and procedures lead to mitigation techniques designed to thwart incidents and manage
the risk to eliminate or minimize the consequences. The potential degradation of the physical plant,
economic status, or stakeholder/national confidence could justify mitigation.
For an ICS, a very important aspect of the risk assessment is to determine the value of the data that is
flowing from the control network to the corporate network. In instances where pricing decisions are
determined from this data, the data could have a very high value. The fiscal justification for mitigation
has to be derived by comparing the mitigation cost to the effects of the consequence. However, it is not
possible to define a one-size-fits-all set of security requirements. A very high level of security may be
achievable but undesirable in many situations because of the loss of functionality and other associated
costs. A well-thought-out security implementation is a balance of risk versus cost. In some situations
the risk may be safety, health, or environment-related rather than purely economic. The risk may result
in an unrecoverable consequence rather than a temporary financial setback

6.2.15 System and Services Acquisition
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 System and Services Acquisition (SA) family
provide the basis for developing policies and procedures for acquisition of resources required to
adequately protect an information system. These acquisitions are based on security requirements and
security specifications. As part of the acquisition procedures, an information system is managed using a
system development life cycle methodology that includes information security considerations. As part of
acquisition, adequate documentation must be maintained on the information system and constituent
components.

6-33

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

The SA family also addresses outsourced systems and the inclusion of adequate security controls by
vendors as specified by the supported organization. Vendors are also responsible for configuration
management and security testing for these outsourced information systems.
Supplemental guidance for the SA controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-23 provides guidance on the acquisition and use of tested/evaluated information
technology products [42].
 NIST SP 800-27 provides guidance on engineering principles for information system security [43].
 NIST SP 800-35 provides guidance on information technology security services [44].
 NIST SP 800-36 provides guidance on the selection of information security products [45].
 NIST SP 800-64 provides guidance on security considerations in the system development life cycle
[46].
 NIST SP 800-65 provides guidance on integrating security into the capital planning and investment
control process [47].
 NIST SP 800-70 provides guidance on configuration settings for information technology products
[26].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
The security requirements of an organization outsourcing the management and control of all or some of
its information systems, networks, and desktop environments should be addressed in a contract agreed
between the parties. External suppliers that have an impact on the security of the organization must be
held to the same security policies and procedures to maintain the overall level of ICS security. Security
policies and procedures of second and third-tier suppliers should also be in compliance with corporate
cybersecurity policies and procedures in the case that they impact ICS security.
DHS has developed a procurement language document [48] for specifying security requirements when
procuring new systems or maintaining existing systems.

6.2.16 System and Communications Protection
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 System and Communications Protection (SC)
family provide policy and procedures for protecting systems and data communications components.
Supplemental guidance for the SC controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-28 provides guidance on active content and mobile code [69].
 NIST SP 800-52 provides guidance on Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations [70].
 NIST SP 800-56 provides guidance on cryptographic key establishment [71].
 NIST SP 800-57 provides guidance on cryptographic key management [72].

 NIST SP 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication [53].
 NIST SP 800-77 provides guidance on IPsec VPNs [74].
6.2.16.1 Encryption
Encryption is the cryptographic transformation of data (called plaintext) into a form (called ciphertext)
that conceals the data’s original meaning to prevent it from being known or used. If the transformation is
reversible, the corresponding reversal process is called decryption, which is a transformation that restores
encrypted data to its original state [75].
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Before deploying encryption, first determine if encryption is an appropriate solution for the specific
ICS application, because authentication and integrity are generally the key security issues for ICS
applications. Other cryptographic solutions such as cryptographic hashes should also be considered.
The use of encryption within an ICS environment could introduce communications latency due to the
additional time and computing resources required to encrypt, decrypt, and authenticate each message.
For ICS, any latency induced from the use of encryption, or any other security technique, must not
degrade the operational performance of the end device or system. Before deploying encryption within
an ICS environment, solutions should go through extensive performance testing. Encryption at OSI
Layer 2 should be considered, rather than at Layer 3 to reduce encryption latency.
In addition, encrypted messages are often larger than unencrypted messages due to one or more of the
following:
 Additional checksums to reduce errors.
 Protocols to control the cryptography.
 Padding (for block ciphers).
 Authentication procedures.
 Other required cryptographic processes.
Cryptography also introduces key management issues. Sound security policies require periodic key
changes. This process becomes more difficult as the geographic size of the ICS increases, with
extensive SCADA systems being the most severe example. Because site visits to change keys can be
costly and slow, it is useful to be able to change keys remotely.
If cryptography is selected, the most effective safeguard is to use a complete cryptographic system
approved by the NIST/ Communications Security Establishment (CSE) Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP)21. Within this program standards are maintained to ensure that
cryptographic systems were studied carefully for weaknesses by a wide range of experts, rather than
being developed by a few engineers in a single organization. At a minimum, certification makes it
probable that:
 Some method (such as counter mode) will be used to ensure that the same message does not
21

Information on the CMVP can be found on the CMVP web site http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/cmvp.htm.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

generate the same value each time.
 ICS messages are protected against replay and forging.
 Key management is secure throughout the life cycle of the key.
 The system is using an effective random number generator.
 The entire system has been implemented securely.
Even then, the technology is effective only if it is an integral part of an effectively enforced information
security policy. American Gas Association (AGA) report 12-1 [5] contains an example of such a
security policy. While it is directed toward a natural gas SCADA system, many of its policy
recommendations could apply to any ICS.
For an ICS, encryption can be deployed as part of a comprehensive, enforced security policy.
Organizations should select cryptographic protection based on a risk assessment and the identified
value of the information being protected and ICS operating constraints. Specifically, a cryptographic
key should be long enough so that guessing it or determining it through analysis takes more effort,
time, and cost than the value of the protected asset.
The encryption hardware should be protected from physical tampering and uncontrolled electronic
connections. Assuming cryptography is the appropriate solution, organizations should select
cryptographic protection with remote key management if the units being protected are so numerous or
geographically dispersed that changing keys is difficult or expensive.
Use separate plaintext and ciphertext ports unless the network absolutely requires the restriction to pass
both plaintext and ciphertext through each port.
Use only modules that can be certified to comply with a standard, such as FIPS 140-2 [90] through the
Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

6.2.16.2 Virtual Private Network (VPN)
One method of encrypting communication data is through a VPN, which is a private network that
operates as an overlay on a public infrastructure, so that the private network can function across a public
network. The most common types of VPN technologies implemented today are:
 Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec is a set of standards defined by IETF to govern the secure
communications of data across public networks at the IP layer. IPsec is included in many current
operating systems. The intent of the standards is to guarantee interoperability across vendor
platforms; however, the reality is that the determination of interoperability of multi-vendor
implementations depends on specific implementation testing conducted by the end-user organization.
IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data
portion (payload) of each packet, but leaves the header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds
a new header to each packet and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving
side, an IPsec-compliant device decrypts each packet. The protocol has been continually enhanced to
address specific requirements, such as extensions to the protocol to address individual user
authentication and NAT device transversal. These extensions are typically vendor-specific and can
lead to interoperability issues primarily in host-to-security gateway environments. NIST SP 800-77
provides guidance on IPsec VPNs [74].

6-36

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL provides a secure channel between two machines that encrypts the
contents of each packet. The IETF made slight modifications to the SSL version 3 protocol and
created a new protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS). The terms “SSL” and “TLS” are often
used interchangeably, and this document generically uses the SSL terminology. SSL is most often
recognized for securing HTTP traffic; this protocol implementation is known as HTTP Secure
(HTTPS). However, SSL is not limited to HTTP traffic; it can be used to secure many different
application layer programs. SSL-based VPN products have gained acceptance because of the market
for “clientless” VPN products. These products use standard Web browsers as clients, which have
built-in SSL support. The “clientless” term means that there is no need to install or configure thirdparty VPN “client” software on users’ systems. NIST SP 800-52 provides guidance on SSL
configuration [70].
 Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining access to a
remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely control Web servers and
other types of servers. The latest version, SSH2, is a proposed set of standards from the IETF.
Typically, SSH is deployed as a secure alternative to a telnet application. SSH is included in most
UNIX distributions, and is typically added to other platforms through a third-party package.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
VPNs are most often used in the ICS environment to provide secure access from an untrusted network
to the ICS control network. Untrusted networks can range from the Internet to the corporate LAN.
Properly configured, VPNs can greatly restrict access to and from control system host computers and
controllers, thereby improving security. They can also potentially improve control network
responsiveness by removing unauthorized non-essential traffic from the intermediary network.
Other possible deployments include using either host-based or mini-standalone security gateways,
either interposed before or running on individual control devices. This technique of implementing
VPNs on an individual device basis can have significant administration overhead.
VPN devices used to protect control systems should be thoroughly tested to verify that the VPN
technology is compatible with the application and that implementation of the VPN devices does not
unacceptably affect network traffic characteristics.

6.2.17 System and Information Integrity
Maintaining system and information integrity assures that sensitive data has not been modified or deleted
in an unauthorized and undetected manner. The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53
System and Information Integrity (SI) family provide policies and procedures for identifying, reporting,
and correcting information system flaws. Controls exist for malicious code detection, spam and spyware
protection, and intrusion detection, although they may not be appropriate for all ICS applications. Also
provided are controls for receiving security alerts and advisories, and the verification of security functions
on the information system. In addition, there are controls within this family to detect and protect against
unauthorized changes to software and data, provide restrictions to data input and output, and check for the
accuracy, completeness, and validity of data as well as handle error conditions, although they may not be
appropriate for all ICS applications.
Supplemental guidance for the SI controls can be found in the following documents:
 NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on security patch installation [40].
 NIST SP 800-94 provides guidance on Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) Systems [55].
 NIST SP 800-100 provides guidance on information security governance and planning [27].

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

6.2.17.1 Virus and Malicious Code Detection
Antivirus and malware code detection products evaluate files on a computer’s storage devices against an
inventory of known malware signature files. If one of the files on a computer matches the profile of a
known virus, the virus is removed through a disinfection process (e.g., quarantine, deletion) so it cannot
infect other local files or communicate across a network to infect other files. Antivirus software can be
deployed on workstations, servers, firewalls and handheld devices.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Antivirus tools only function effectively when installed, configured, running full-time, and maintained
properly against the state of known attack methods and payloads. While antivirus tools are common
security practice in IT computer systems, their use with ICS may require adopting special practices
including compatibility checks, change management issues, and performance impact metrics. These
special practices should be utilized whenever new signatures or new versions of antivirus software are
installed.
Major ICS vendors recommend and even support the use of particular antivirus tools. In some cases,
control system vendors may have performed regression testing across their product line for supported
versions of a particular antivirus tool and also provide associated installation and configuration
documentation. There is also an effort to develop a general set of guidelines and test procedures
focused on ICS performance impacts to fill the gaps where ICS and antivirus vendor guidance is not
available [56].
Generally:
 Windows, Unix, Linux systems, etc. used as consoles, engineering workstations, data historians,
HMIs and general purpose SCADA and backup servers can be secured just like commercial IT
equipment: install push- or auto-updated antivirus and patch management software with updates
distributed via an antivirus server and patch management server located inside the process control
network and auto-updated from the IT network.
 Follow vendor recommendations on all other servers and computers (DCS, PLC, instruments) that
have time-dependent code, modified or extended the operating system or any other change that
makes it different from any standard PC that one could buy at an office supply or computer store.
Expect the vendor to make periodic maintenance releases that include security patches.

6.2.17.2 Intrusion Detection and Prevention
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor events on a network, such as traffic patterns, or a system, such
as log entries or file accesses, so that they can identify an intruder breaking into or attempting to break
into a system [57]. IDS ensure that unusual activity such as new open ports, unusual traffic patterns, or
changes to critical operating system files is brought to the attention of the appropriate security personnel.
The two most commonly used types of IDS are:
 Network-Based IDS. These systems monitor network traffic and generate alarms when they identify
traffic that they deem to be an attack.

6-39

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

 Host-Based IDS. This software monitors one or more types of characteristics of a system, such as
application log file entries, system configuration changes, and access to sensitive data on a system
and responds with an alarm or countermeasure when a user attempts to breach security.
ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
An effective IDS deployment typically involves both host-based and network-based IDS. In the current
ICS environment, network-based IDS are most often deployed between the control network and the
corporate network in conjunction with a firewall; host-based IDS are most often deployed on the
computers that use general-purpose OSs or applications such as HMIs, SCADA servers, and
engineering workstations. Properly configured, an IDS can greatly enhance the security management
team’s ability to detect attacks entering or leaving the system, thereby improving security. They can
also potentially improve a control network’s efficiency by detecting non-essential traffic on the
network. However, even when IDS are implemented, security staff can primarily recognize individual
attacks, as opposed to organized patterns of attacks over time. Network security monitoring and an
understanding of the normal state of the ICS network can help distinguish attacks from transient
conditions, and both trigger and provide information into events that are outside the normal state.
Current IDS and IPS products are effective in detecting and preventing well-known Internet attacks,
but until recently they have not addressed ICS protocol attacks. IDS and IPS vendors are beginning to
develop and incorporate attack signatures for various ICS protocols such as Modbus, DNP3, and ICCP
[58].

6.2.17.3 Patch Management
Patches are additional pieces of code that have been developed to address specific problems or flaws in
existing software. Vulnerabilities are flaws that can be exploited, enabling unauthorized access to IT
systems or enabling users to have access to greater privileges than authorized.
A systematic approach to managing and using software patches can help organizations to improve the
overall security of their IT systems in a cost-effective way. Organizations that actively manage and use
software patches can reduce the chances that the vulnerabilities in their IT systems can be exploited; in
addition, they can save time and money that might be spent in responding to vulnerability-related
incidents.
NIST SP 800-40 Revision 3 [40] provides guidance for organizational security managers who are
responsible for designing and implementing security patch and vulnerability management programs and
for testing the effectiveness of the programs in reducing vulnerabilities. The guidance is also useful to
system administrators and operations personnel who are responsible for applying and testing patches and
for deploying solutions to vulnerability problems.

ICS-specific Recommendations and Guidance
Applying patches to OS components creates another situation where significant care should be
exercised in the ICS environment. Patches should be adequately tested (e.g., off-line on a comparable
ICS) to determine the acceptability of side effects. Regression testing is advised. It is not uncommon
for patches to have an adverse effect on other software. A patch may remove a vulnerability, but it can

6-40

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

also introduce a greater risk from a production or safety perspective. Patching the vulnerability may
also change the way the OS or application works with control applications, causing the control
application to lose some of its functionality. Another issue is that many ICS utilize older versions of
operating systems that are no longer supported by the vendor. Consequently, available patches may not
be applicable. Organizations should implement a systematic, accountable, and documented ICS patch
management process for managing exposure to vulnerabilities.
Once the decision is made to deploy a patch, there are other tools that automate this process from a
centralized server and with confirmation that the patch has been deployed correctly. Consider
separating the automated process for ICS patch management from the automated process for non-ICS
applications. Patching should be scheduled to occur during planned ICS outages.

6.2.18 Program Management
The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 Program Management (PM) focus on the
organization-wide information security requirements that are independent of any particular information
system and are essential for managing information security programs.
Organizations document program management controls in the information security program plan. The
organization-wide information security program plan supplements the individual security plans developed
for each organizational information system. In addition to documenting the information security program
management controls, the security program plan provides a vehicle for the organization, in a central
repository, to document all security controls that have been designated as common controls (i.e., security
controls inherited by organizational information systems).
6.2.19 Privacy Controls
Protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII)22 collected, used, maintained, shared,
and disposed of by programs and information systems is critical given the advances in information
technologies and applications of those technologies. Effective privacy for individuals depends on the
safeguards employed within the organizational information systems that are processing, storing, and
transmitting PII. Organizations cannot have effective privacy without a foundation of information
security. However, privacy is more than security and includes, for example, the principles of
transparency, notice, and choice.
The privacy controls focus on information privacy as a value distinct from, but highly interrelated with,
information security. The privacy controls are based on the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs)
embodied in the Privacy Act of 1974, Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002, and related Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. The FIPPs are designed to build public trust in an
organization’s privacy practices and to help organizations avoid tangible costs and intangible damages
stemming from privacy incidents.
22

OMB Memorandum 07-16 defines PII as “information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity such
as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc., alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying
information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.”
[86]. OMB Memorandum 10-22 reaffirmed this definition [87]. NIST Special Publication 800-122 defines PII as “any
information about an individual [that is] maintained by an agency, including: (i) any information that can be used to distinguish
or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or
biometric records; and (ii) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational,
financial, and employment information” [88].

6-41

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Privacy controls are the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within organizations
to protect and ensure the proper handling of PII. There are eight privacy control families with each family
aligning with one of the FIPPs. The privacy control families can be implemented at the organization,
department, agency, component, office, program, or information system level. The privacy controls are
structured in a similar manner to the information system security controls in Appendix F of NIST SP 80053.
The Privacy Appendix of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4 [22], provides a structured set of privacy controls,
based on international standards and best practices to help organizations enforce requirements derived
from federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and guidance. Additionally, it
establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of enforcing
respective privacy and security requirements that may overlap in concept and in implementation within
federal information systems, programs, and organizations.
The privacy controls are intended primarily for use by an organization’s Senior Agency Official for
Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) when working with program managers, information system
developers, and information security personnel to determine how best to incorporate effective privacy
protections and practices within those programs and/or systems. These controls facilitate the
organization’s efforts to comply with privacy requirements affecting those programs and/or systems that
collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. This promotes closer cooperation between privacy and
security officials within the federal government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives
in enforcing the requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards,
and guidance.
The 8 privacy control families include:
 Authority and Purpose (AP).
 Accountability, Audit, and Risk Management (AR).
 Data Quality and Integrity (DI).
 Data Minimization and Retention (DM).
 Individual Participation and Redress (IP).
 Security (SE).
 Transparency (TR).
 Use Limitation (UL).

Security Policy

Security policies define the objectives and constraints for the security program.
Policies are created at several levels, ranging from organization or corporate policy
to specific operational constraints (e.g., remote access). In general, policies
provide answers to the questions “what” and “why” without dealing with “how.”
Policies are normally stated in terms that are technology-independent.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Appendix C—Threat Sources, Vulnerabilities, and Incidents
Several terms are used to describe the inter-related concepts of threat, threat source, threat event, and
incident. A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational
operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction,
disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. Threats have some intent or method that
may exploit of a vulnerability through either intentional or unintentional means, this intent or method
referred to as the threat source. A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system (including an
ICS), system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered
by a threat source. A threat event is an event or situation that has the potential for causing undesirable
consequences or impact. When a threat event occurs it becomes an incident that actually or potentially
jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the
system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of
security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. This section will explore ICS-specific
threat sources, vulnerabilities, and incidents.
Threat Sources
Threats to ICS can come from numerous sources, which can be classified as adversarial, accidental,
structural, and environmental. Table C-1 lists and defines known threats sources to ICS. It is necessary to
create a risk management strategy for the ICS that protects the system against these possible threat
sources. The threat source must be well understood in order to define and implement adequate protection.
For example, environmental events (e.g. floods, earthquakes) are well understood, but may vary in their
magnitude, frequency, and their ability to compound other interconnected events. However, adversarial
threats depend on the resources available to the adversary and the emergence of previously unknown
vulnerabilities or attacks.

Note: Natural and man-made disasters can also

and the threat event are strongly identified,
severity and duration can be included in the
description of the threat event (e.g., Category 5
hurricane causes extensive damage to the
facilities housing mission-critical systems,
making those systems unavailable for three
weeks).

Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
This section addresses vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions that may be found in typical ICS.
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in information systems, system procedures, controls, or implementations
the can be exploited by a threat source. Predisposing conditions are properties of the organization,
mission/business process, architecture, or information systems that contribute to the likelihood of a threat
event. The order of these vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions does not necessarily reflect any
priority in terms of likelihood of occurrence or severity of impact. Additionally, the vulnerabilities and
predisposing conditions identified in this section should not be considered a complete list; it should also
not be assumed that these issues are found within every ICS.

C-2

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

The vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are grouped according to where they exist–such as in the
organization’s policy and procedures, or the inadequacy of security mechanisms implemented in
hardware, firmware, and software. The former are referred to as being in the organization and the latter as
being in the system. Understanding the source of vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions can assist in
determining optimal mitigation strategies. The groups of vulnerabilities used in this appendix are:
 Policy and Procedure.
 Architecture and Design.
 Configuration and Maintenance.
 Physical.
 Software Development.
 Communication and Network.
Deeper analysis may uncover that causes and observations may not be one-to-one; that is, some
underlying causes may exhibit multiple symptoms and some symptoms may come from more than one
cause. SP 800-53 contains a taxonomy of security controls, or countermeasures, to mitigate vulnerabilities
and predisposing conditions. These are categorized in families, where each family contains security
controls related to the general security topic of the family. While the families and controls from 800-53
provide a more complete overview of the potential vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions within in
an ICS, this section briefly reviews those issues known to be common within ICS.
Any given ICS will usually exhibit a subset of the identified vulnerabilities, but may also contain
additional vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions unique to the particular ICS implementation that do
not appear in this appendix. Specific current information on ICS vulnerabilities can be researched at the
Industrial Control System Computer Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) Web site.23
Some vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions can be mitigated; others can only be accepted and
controlled by appropriate countermeasures, but will result in some residual risk to the ICS. For example,
some existing policies and procedures may be changed with a level of effort that the organization
considers acceptable; others are more expeditiously dealt with by instituting additional policies and
procedures.
Vulnerabilities in products and services acquired from outside the organization are rarely under the direct
control of the organization. Changes may be influenced by market forces, but this is a slow and indirect
approach. Instead, the organization may change predisposing conditions to reduce the likelihood that a
systemic vulnerability will be exploited.
Policy and Procedure Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are often introduced into the ICS because of incomplete,
inappropriate, or nonexistent security policy, including its documentation, implementation guides (e.g.,
procedures), and enforcement. Management support of security policy and procedures is the cornerstone
of any security program. Organization security policy can reduce vulnerabilities by mandating and
enforcing proper conduct. Written policy and procedures are mechanisms for informing staff and
stakeholders of decisions about behavior that is beneficial to the organization. From this perspective,
policy is an educational and instructive way to reduce vulnerabilities. Enforcement is partner to policy,
encouraging people to do the “right” thing. Various forms of corrective action are the usual consequences

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

to personnel not following policy and procedures. Policies should be explicit about the consequences to
individuals or organizations that do not conform.
There is usually a complex policy and procedure environment that includes laws and regulations,
overlapping jurisdictions and spheres of influence, economics, custom, and history. The larger enterprise
is often subdivided into organizational units that should work together to reduce vulnerabilities. The
scope and hierarchical relationship among policies and procedures needs to be managed for maximum
effectiveness.
Certain controls in SP 800-53 and the ICS overlay in Appendix G— specify responsibilities and
requirements for the organization, while others focus on the capabilities and operation of the various
systems within the organization. For example, the control AC-6, Least Privilege, states “The organization
employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting
on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational
missions and business functions.” The organization has to make decisions that get codified in policy and
procedures. Some resulting artifacts, such as job descriptions that include roles, responsibilities, and
authority, remain in a form suitable for people, while other artifacts, such as attributes, privileges, and
access control rules, are implemented in IT.
Note that the ICS overlay follows SP 800-53 in employing the term “organization” very flexibly so that
its guidance can be used by all sizes of organizational entities up and down an organization chart. Specific
organizations should be identified, starting with the organization responsible for issuing and maintaining
the policy or procedure.
Table C-2 presents examples of observed policy and procedure vulnerabilities for ICS.
Table C-2. Policy and Procedure Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerability

Description

Inadequate security policy for the
ICS

Vulnerabilities are often introduced into ICS due to inadequate policies or
the lack of policies specifically for control system security. Every
countermeasure should be traceable to a policy. This ensures uniformity
and accountability. Policy must include portable and mobile devices used
with ICS.

No formal ICS security training and
awareness program

A documented formal security training and awareness policy and program is
designed to keep staff up to date on organizational security policies and
procedures as well as threats, industry cybersecurity standards, and
recommended practices. Without training on specific ICS policies and
procedures, staff cannot be expected to maintain a secure ICS environment.

Absent or deficient ICS equipment
implementation guidelines

Equipment implementation guidelines should be kept up to date and readily
available. These guidelines are an integral part of security procedures in the
event of an ICS malfunction.

Lack of administrative mechanisms
for security policy enforcement

Staff responsible for enforcing security should be held accountable for
administering documented security policies and procedures.

Inadequate review of the
effectiveness of the ICS security
controls

Procedures and schedules should exist to determine the extent to which the
security program and its constituent controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
meeting the security requirements for the ICS. The examination is
sometimes called an “audit,” “evaluation,” or “assessment.” Policy should
address the stage of the life-cycle, purpose, technical expertise,
methodology, and level of independence.

Vulnerability

Description

No ICS-specific contingency plan

A contingency plan should be prepared, tested and available in the event of
a major hardware or software failure or destruction of facilities. Lack of a
specific plan for the ICS could lead to extended downtimes and production
loss.

Lack of configuration management
policy

Lack of policy and procedures for ICS configuration change management
can lead to unmanageable and highly vulnerable inventory of hardware,
firmware, and software.

Lack of adequate access control
policy

Access control enforcement depends of policy the correctly models roles,
responsibilities, and authorizations. The policy model must enable the way
the organization functions.

Lack of adequate authentication
policy

Authentication policies are needed to define when authentication
mechanisms (e.g., passwords, smart cards) must be used, how strong they
must be, and how they must be maintained. Without policy, systems might
not have appropriate authentication controls, making unauthorized access to
systems more likely. Authentication policies should be developed as part of
an overall ICS security program taking into account the capabilities of the
ICS and its personnel to handle more complex passwords and other
mechanisms.

Inadequate incident detection and
response plan and procedures

Incident detection and response plans, procedures, and methods are
necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction,
preserving evidence for later forensic examination, mitigating the
weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring ICS services. Establishing a
successful incident response capability includes continually monitoring for
anomalies, prioritizing the handling of incidents, and implementing effective
methods of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data.

Lack of redundancy for critical
components

Lack of redundancy in critical components could provide single point of
failure possibilities

System Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Security controls must clearly identify the systems to which they apply. Systems range widely in size,
scope, and capability. At the small end of the spectrum, a system may be an individual hardware or
software product or service. At the other end of the spectrum we find large complex systems, systems-ofsystems, and networks, all of which incorporate hardware architecture and software framework (including
application frameworks), where the combination supports the operation of the ICS.
System vulnerabilities can occur in the hardware, firmware, and software used to build the ICS. Sources
of vulnerabilities include design flaws, development flaws, misconfigurations, poor maintenance, poor
administration, and connections with other systems and networks. Many of the controls in the SP 800-53
and the ICS overlay in Appendix G— specify what the system must do to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
The potential vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions commonly found within ICS systems are
categorized with the following tables:
 Table C-3. Architecture and Design Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions.
 Table C-4. Configuration and Maintenance Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions.

Vulnerability
Inadequate incorporation of
security into architecture and
design.

Insecure architecture allowed to
evolve

No security perimeter defined

Description
Incorporating security into the ICS architecture, design must start with
budget, and schedule of the ICS. The security architecture is part of the
Enterprise Architecture. The architectures must address the identification
and authorization of users, access control mechanism, network topologies,
and system configuration and integrity mechanisms.
The network infrastructure environment within the ICS has often been
developed and modified based on business and operational requirements,
with little consideration for the potential security impacts of the changes.
Over time, security gaps may have been inadvertently introduced within
particular portions of the infrastructure. Without remediation, these gaps
may represent backdoors into the ICS.
If the ICS does not have a security perimeter clearly defined, then it is not
possible to ensure that the necessary security controls are deployed and
configured properly. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and
data, as well as other problems.

Control networks used for noncontrol traffic

Control and non-control traffic have different requirements, such as
determinism and reliability, so having both types of traffic on a single
network makes it more difficult to configure the network so that it meets the
requirements of the control traffic. For example, non-control traffic could
inadvertently consume resources that control traffic needs, causing
disruptions in ICS functions.

Control network services not within
the control network

Where IT services such as Domain Name System (DNS), and Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) are used by control networks, they are
often implemented in the IT network, causing the ICS network to become
dependent on the IT network that may not have the reliability and availability
requirements needed by the ICS.

Inadequate collection of event data
history

Forensic analysis depends on collection and retention of sufficient data.
Without proper and accurate data collection, it might be impossible to
determine what caused a security incident to occur. Incidents might go
unnoticed, leading to additional damage and/or disruption. Regular security
monitoring is also needed to identify problems with security controls, such
as misconfigurations and failures.

Table C-4. Configuration and Maintenance Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerability

Description

Hardware, firmware, and software
not under configuration
management.

The organization doesn’t know what it has, what versions it has, where they
are, or what their patch status is, resulting in an inconsistent, and ineffective
defense posture. A process for controlling modifications to hardware,
firmware, software, and documentation should be implemented to ensure an
ICS is protected against inadequate or improper modifications before,
during, and after system implementation. A lack of configuration change
management procedures can lead to security oversights, exposures, and
risks. To properly secure an ICS, there should be an accurate listing of the
assets in the system and their current configurations. These procedures are
critical to executing business continuity and disaster recovery plans.

C-6

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Vulnerability

Description

OS and vendor software patches
may not be developed until
significantly after security
vulnerabilities are found

Because of the tight coupling between ICS software and the underlying ICS,
changes must undergo expensive and time-consuming comprehensive
regression testing. The elapsed time for such testing and subsequent
distribution of updated software provides a long window of vulnerability

OS and application security
patches are not maintained or
vendor declines to patch
vulnerability

Out-of-date OSs and applications may contain newly discovered
vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Documented procedures should be
developed for how security patches will be maintained. Security patch
support may not even be available for ICS that use outdated OSs, so
procedures should include contingency plans for mitigating vulnerabilities
where patches may never be available.

Inadequate testing of security
changes

Modifications to hardware, firmware, and software deployed without testing
could compromise normal operation of the ICS. Documented procedures
should be developed for testing all changes for security impact. The live
operational systems should never be used for testing. The testing of system
modifications may need to be coordinated with system vendors and
integrators.

Poor remote access controls

There are many reasons why an ICS may need to be remotely accessed,
including vendors and system integrators performing system maintenance
functions, and also ICS engineers accessing geographically remote system
components. Remote access capabilities must be adequately controlled to
prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to the ICS.

Poor configurations are used

Improperly configured systems may leave unnecessary ports and protocols
open, these unnecessary functions may contain vulnerabilities that increase
the overall risk to the system. Using default configurations often exposes
vulnerabilities and exploitable services. All settings should be examined.

Critical configurations are not
stored or backed up

Procedures should be available for restoring ICS configuration settings in
the event of accidental or adversary-initiated configuration changes to
maintain system availability and prevent loss of data. Documented
procedures should be developed for maintaining ICS configuration settings.

Data unprotected on portable
device

If sensitive data (e.g., passwords, dial-up numbers) is stored in the clear on
portable devices such as laptops and mobile devices and these devices are
lost or stolen, system security could be compromised. Policy, procedures,
and mechanisms are required for protection.
There is a large body of experience with using passwords in IT that is
applicable to ICS. Password policy and procedure must be followed to be
effective. Violations of password policy and procedures can drastically
increase ICS vulnerability.
Access controls must be matched to the way the organization allocates
responsibilities and privilege to its personnel. Poorly specified access
controls can result in giving an ICS user too many or too few privileges. The
following exemplify each case:

System configured with default access control settings gives an
operator administrative privileges

System improperly configured results in an operator being unable
to take corrective actions in an emergency situation

Passwords generation, use, and
protection not in accord with policy

Inadequate access controls applied

Improper data linking

ICS data storage systems may be linked with non-ICS data sources. An
example of this is database links, which allow data from one database to be
automatically replicated to others. Data linkage may create a vulnerability if
it is not properly configured and may allow unauthorized data access or
manipulation.

Malware protection not installed or
up to date

Installation of malicious software, or malware, is a common attack. Malware
protection software, such as antivirus software, must be kept current in a
very dynamic environment. Outdated malware protection software and
definitions leave the system open to new malware threats.

Vulnerability

Description

Malware protection implemented
without sufficient testing

Malware protection software deployed without sufficient testing could impact
normal operation of the ICS and block the system from performing
necessary control actions.

Denial of service (DoS)

ICS software could be vulnerable to DoS attacks, resulting in the prevention
of authorized access to a system resource or delaying system operations
and functions.

Intrusion detection/prevention
software not installed

Incidents can result in loss of system availability and integrity; the capture,
modification, and deletion of data; and incorrect execution of control
commands. IDS/IPS software may stop or prevent various types of attacks,
including DoS attacks, and also identify attacked internal hosts, such as
those infected with worms. IDS/IPS software must be tested prior to
deployment to determine that it does not compromise normal operation of
the ICS.

Logs not maintained

Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine what
caused a security event to occur.

Table C-5. Physical Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerability
Unauthorized personnel have
physical access to equipment

Radio frequency, electromagnetic
pulse (EMP), static discharge,
brownouts and voltage spikes

Description
Physical access to ICS equipment should be restricted to only the
necessary personnel, taking into account safety requirements, such as
emergency shutdown or restarts. Improper access to ICS equipment can
lead to any of the following:

Physical theft of data and hardware

Physical damage or destruction of data and hardware

Unauthorized changes to the functional environment (e.g., data
connections, unauthorized use of removable media,
adding/removing resources)

Disconnection of physical data links

Undetectable interception of data (keystroke and other input
logging)
The hardware used for control systems is vulnerable to radio frequency and
electro-magnetic pulses (EMP), static discharge, brownouts and voltage
spikes.. The impact can range from temporary disruption of command and
control to permanent damage to circuit boards. Proper shielding, grounding,
power conditioning, and/or surge suppression is recommended.

Lack of backup power

Without backup power to critical assets, a general loss of power will shut
down the ICS and could create an unsafe situation. Loss of power could
also lead to insecure default settings.

Loss of environmental control

Loss of environmental control (e.g., temperatures, humidity) could lead to
equipment damage, such as processors overheating. Some processors will
shut down to protect themselves; some may continue to operate but in a
minimal capacity and may produce intermittent errors, continually reboot, or
become permanently incapacitated.

Unsecured physical ports

Unsecured universal serial bus (USB) and PS/2 ports could allow
unauthorized connection of thumb drives, keystroke loggers, etc.

Security capabilities that were installed with the product are useless if they
are not enabled or at least identified as being disabled.

Inadequate authentication,
privileges, and access control in
software

Unauthorized access to configuration and programming software could
provide the ability to corrupt a device.

Table C-7. Communication and Network Configuration Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerability

Description

Data flow controls not employed

Data flow controls, based on data characteristics, are needed to restrict
which information is permitted between systems. These controls can
prevent exfiltration of information and illegal operations.

Firewalls nonexistent or improperly
configured

A lack of properly configured firewalls could permit unnecessary data to
pass between networks, such as control and corporate networks, allowing
attacks and malware to spread between networks, making sensitive data
susceptible to monitoring/eavesdropping, and providing individuals with
unauthorized access to systems.

Inadequate firewall and router logs

Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine what
caused a security incident to occur.

Standard, well-documented
communication protocols are used
in plain text

Adversaries that can monitor the ICS network activity can use a protocol
analyzer or other utilities to decode the data transferred by protocols such
as telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
and Network File System (NFS). The use of such protocols also makes it
easier for adversaries to perform attacks against the ICS and manipulate
ICS network activity.

Authentication of users, data or
devices is substandard or
nonexistent

Many ICS protocols have no authentication at any level. Without
authentication, there is the potential to replay, modify, or spoof data or to
spoof devices such as sensors and user identities.

Use of unsecure industry-wide ICS
protocols

ICS protocols often have few or no security capabilities, such as
authentication and encryption, to protect data from unauthorized access or
tampering. Additionally, incorrect implementation of the protocols can lead
to additional vulnerabilities.

Lack of integrity checking for
communications

There are no integrity checks built into most industrial control protocols;
adversaries could manipulate communications undetected. To ensure
integrity, the ICS can use lower-layer protocols (e.g., IPsec) that offer data
integrity protection.

Inadequate authentication between
wireless clients and access points

Strong mutual authentication between wireless clients and access points is
needed to ensure that clients do not connect to a rogue access point
deployed by an adversary, and also to ensure that adversaries do not
connect to any of the ICS’s wireless networks.

Inadequate data protection
between wireless clients and
access points

Sensitive data between wireless clients and access points should be
protected using strong encryption to ensure that adversaries cannot gain
unauthorized access to the unencrypted data.

Incidents
A threat event is an event or situations that could potentially cause an undesirable consequence or impact
to the ICS resulting from some threat source. In NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, Appendix E identifies a broad
set of threat events that could potentially impact information systems [79]. The properties of an ICS may
also present unique threat events, specifically addressing how the threat events can manipulates the
process of the ICS to cause physical damage. Table C-8 provides an overview of potential ICS threat
events.
Table C-8. Example Adversarial Incidents
Threat Event
Denial of Control Action

Control Devices Reprogrammed

Spoofed System Status Information

Control Logic Manipulation
Safety Systems Modified

Malware on Control Systems

Description
Control systems operation disrupted by delaying or blocking the flow of
information, thereby denying availability of the networks to control system
operators or causing information transfer bottlenecks or denial of service by
IT-resident services (such as DNS)
Unauthorized changes made to programmed instructions in PLCs, RTUs,
DCS, or SCADA controllers, alarm thresholds changed, or unauthorized
commands issued to control equipment, which could potentially result in
damage to equipment (if tolerances are exceeded), premature shutdown of
processes (such as prematurely shutting down transmission lines), causing
an environmental incident, or even disabling control equipment
False information sent to control system operators either to disguise
unauthorized changes or to initiate inappropriate actions by system
operators
Control system software or configuration settings modified, producing
unpredictable results
Safety systems operation are manipulated such that they either (1) do not
operate when needed or (2) perform incorrect control actions that damage
the ICS
Malicious software (e.g., virus, worm, Trojan horse) introduced into the
system.

In addition, in control systems that cover a wide geographic area, the remote sites are often not staffed
and may not be physically monitored. If such remote systems are physically breached, the adversaries
could establish a connection back to the control network.
Sources of Incidents
An accurate accounting of cyber incidents on control systems is difficult to determine. However,
individuals in the industry who have been focusing on this issue see similar growth trends between
vulnerabilities exposed in traditional IT systems and those being found in control systems. ICS-CERT is a
DHS organization that focuses on reducing the risk across critical infrastructure by identifying threats and
vulnerabilities, while also providing mitigation strategies. ICS-CERT provides a trusted party where
system owners and operators can report information about incidents within their ICS and obtain advice on
mitigating their risk. Information submitted by infrastructure owners and operators is protected under the
Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII)
from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), disclosure under state, tribal, and local
disclosure laws, use in regulatory actions, and use in civil litigation. In the event of an incident at critical
infrastructure facilities, ICS-CERT can also perform onsite deployments to respond to and analyze
incidents. ICS-CERT publishes advisories of new security vulnerabilities discovered in common ICS
platforms. Figure C-1 demonstrates (1) the number of ICS incidents reported, (2) the number of onsite

ICS deployments taken by ICS-CERT, and (3) number of ICS vulnerabilities reported between years
2010 and 201324.
Other sources of control system impact information show an increase in control system incidents as well.
This information should not be assumed to contain all ICS related incidents or discovered vulnerabilities
as some information may go unreported.

Figure C-1. ICS-CERT Reported Incidents by Year

Documented Incidents
Numerous ICS incidents have been reported that demonstrate how threat sources can negatively impact an
ICS. These events help demonstrate the severity of the threat sources, vulnerabilities, and impacts within
the ICS domain. As mentioned in Section C.2, the four broad categories of threat sources are adversarial,
accidental, structural, and environmental. Often the incident can be the result of multiple threat sources
(e.g. an environmental event causes a system failure, which is responded to incorrectly by an operator
resulting in an accidental event). Reported incidents from these categories include the following:
Adversarial Events
 Worcester Air Traffic Communications25. In March 1997, a teenager in Worcester, Massachusetts
disabled part of the public switched telephone network using a dial-up modem connected to the
system. This knocked out phone service at the control tower, airport security, the airport fire
department, the weather service, and carriers that use the airport. Also, the tower’s main radio
transmitter and another transmitter that activates runway lights were shut down, as well as a printer
that controllers use to monitor flight progress. The attack also knocked out phone service to 600
homes and businesses in the nearby town of Rutland.

 Maroochy Shire Sewage Spill26. In the spring of 2000, a former employee of an Australian
organization that develops manufacturing software applied for a job with the local government, but
was rejected. Over a two-month period, the disgruntled rejected employee reportedly used a radio
transmitter on as many as 46 occasions to remotely break into the controls of a sewage treatment
system. He altered electronic data for particular sewerage pumping stations and caused malfunctions
in their operations, ultimately releasing about 264 000 gallons of raw sewage into nearby rivers and
parks.
 Davis-Besse27. In August 2003, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed that in January 2003,
the Microsoft SQL Server worm known as Slammer infected a private computer network at the idled
Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Oak Harbor, Ohio, disabling a safety monitoring system for
nearly five hours. In addition, the plant’s process computer failed, and it took about six hours for it to
become available again. Slammer reportedly also affected communications on the control networks of
at least five other utilities by propagating so quickly that control system traffic was blocked.
 Zotob Worm28. In August 2005, a round of Internet worm infections knocked 13 of
DaimlerChrysler’s U.S. automobile manufacturing plants offline for almost an hour, stranding
workers as infected Microsoft Windows systems were patched. Plants in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin,
Ohio, Delaware, and Michigan were knocked offline. While the worm affected primarily Windows
2000 systems, it also affected some early versions of Windows XP. Symptoms include the repeated
shutdown and rebooting of a computer. Zotob and its variations caused computer outages at heavyequipment maker Caterpillar Inc., aircraft-maker Boeing, and several large U.S. news organizations.
 Stuxnet Worm29. Stuxnet was a Microsoft Windows computer worm discovered in July 2010 that
specifically targeted industrial software and equipment. The worm initially spread indiscriminately,
but included a highly specialized malware payload that was designed to target only specific SCADA
systems that were configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes
 Brute Force Attacks on Internet-Facing Control Systems30. On February 22, 2013 ICS-CERT
received a report from a gas compressor station owner about an increase in brute force attempts to
access their process control network. The forensic evidence contained 10 separate IPs and additional
calls of a similar nature from additional natural gas pipeline asset owners, which yielded 39 additional
IPs of concern. Log analysis showed a date range from January 16, 2013 but there have been no
reports since March 8, 2013.
 Shamoon31. Saudi Aramco, which is the world’s 8th largest oil refiner, experienced a malware attack
that targeted their refineries and overwrote the attacked system’s Master Boot Records (MBR),
partition tables and other random data files. This caused the systems to become unusable.

 German Steel Mill Attack32. In 2014, hackers manipulated and disrupted control systems to such a
degree that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in “massive”—though
unspecified—damage.
Structural Events
 CSX Train Signaling System33. In August 2003, the Sobig computer virus was blamed for shutting
down train signaling systems throughout the east coast of the U.S. The virus infected the computer
system at CSX Corp.’s Jacksonville, Florida headquarters, shutting down signaling, dispatching, and
other systems. According to Amtrak spokesman Dan Stessel, ten Amtrak trains were affected in the
morning. Trains between Pittsburgh and Florence, South Carolina were halted because of dark
signals, and one regional Amtrak train from Richmond, Virginia to Washington and New York was
delayed for more than two hours. Long-distance trains were also delayed between four and six hours.
 Northeast Power Blackout34. In August 2003, failure of the alarm processor in First Energy’s
SCADA system prevented control room operators from having adequate situational awareness of
critical operational changes to the electrical grid. Additionally, effective reliability oversight was
prevented when the state estimator at the Midwest Independent System Operator failed due to
incomplete information on topology changes, preventing contingency analysis. Several key 345 kV
transmission lines in Northern Ohio tripped due to contact with trees. This eventually initiated
cascading overloads of additional 345 kV and 138 kV lines, leading to an uncontrolled cascading
failure of the grid. A total of 61 800 MW load was lost as 508 generating units at 265 power plants
tripped.
 Taum Sauk Water Storage Dam Failure35. In December 2005, the Taum Sauk Water Storage Dam
suffered a catastrophic failure releasing a billion gallons of water. The failure of the reservoir
occurred as the reservoir was being filled to capacity or may have possibly been overtopped. The
current working theory is that the reservoir's berm was overtopped when the routine nightly pumpback operation failed to cease when the reservoir was filled. According to the utility, the gauges at the
dam read differently than the gauges at the Osage plant at the Lake of the Ozarks, which monitors and
operates the Taum Sauk plant remotely. The stations are linked together using a network of
microwave towers, and there are no operators on-site at Taum Sauk.
 Bellingham, Washington Gasoline Pipeline Failure36. In June 1999, 900 000 liters (237 000
gallons) of gasoline leaked from a 16 in. (40.64 cm) pipeline and ignited 1.5 hours later causing 3
deaths, 8 injuries, and extensive property damage. The pipeline failure was exacerbated by control
systems not able to perform control and monitoring functions. “Immediately prior to and during the
incident, the SCADA system exhibited poor performance that inhibited the pipeline controllers from
seeing and reacting to the development of an abnormal pipeline operation.” A key recommendation

from the NTSB report issued October 2002 was to utilize an off-line development and testing system
for implementing and testing changes to the SCADA database.
 Browns Ferry-3 PLC Failure37. In August 2006, TVA was forced to manually shut down one of
their plant's two reactors after unresponsive PLCs problems caused two water pumps to fail and
threatened the stability of the plant itself. Although there were dual redundant PLCs, they were
connected to the same Ethernet network. Later testing on the failed devices discovered that they
would crash when they encountered excessive network traffic.
Environmental Events
 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster38. The Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011 struck
off the coast of Japan, sending a massive tsunami inland towards the nuclear plant. The tsunami
compromised the plants seawall, flooding much of the plant including the location housing the
emergency generators. This emergency power was critical to operate the control rooms and also to
provide coolant water for the reactors. The loss of coolant caused the reactor cores to overheat to the
point where the fuel's zirconium cladding reacted with water, releasing hydrogen gas and fueling
large explosions in three of the four reactor buildings. This resulted in large-scale radiation leakage
that has impacted plant employees, nearby citizens, and the local environment. Post event analysis
found that the plant’s emergency response center had insufficient secure communication lines to
provide other areas of the plant with information on key safety related instrumentation.
Accidental Events
 Vulnerability Scanner Incidents39. While a ping sweep was being performed on an active SCADA
network that controlled 3 meter (9 foot) robotic arms, it was noticed that one arm became active and
swung around 180 degrees. The controller for the arm was in standby mode before the ping sweep
was initiated. In a separate incident, a ping sweep was being performed on an ICS network to identify
all hosts that were attached to the network, for inventory purposes, and it caused a system controlling
the creation of integrated circuits in the fabrication plant to hang. This test resulted in the destruction
of $50,000 worth of wafers.
 Penetration Testing Incident40. A natural gas utility hired an IT security consulting organization to
conduct penetration testing on its corporate IT network. The consulting organization carelessly
ventured into a part of the network that was directly connected to the SCADA system. The
penetration test locked up the SCADA system and the utility was not able to send gas through its
pipelines for four hours. The outcome was the loss of service to its customer base for those four
hours.

ICS-CERT Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET®)

http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Assessments
The Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET®) is a DHS product that assists organizations in protecting
their key national cyber assets. It was developed under the direction of the DHS ICS-CERT by
cybersecurity experts and with assistance from NIST. This tool provides users with a systematic and
repeatable approach for assessing the security posture of their cyber systems and networks. It includes
both high-level and detailed questions related to all industrial control and IT systems.
CSET is a desktop software tool that guides users through a step-by-step process to assess their control
system and information technology network security practices against recognized industry standards. The
output from CSET is a prioritized list of recommendations for improving the cybersecurity posture of the
organization's enterprise and industrial control cyber systems. The tool derives the recommendations from
a database of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices. Each recommendation is linked to a set of
actions that can be applied to enhance cybersecurity controls.
CSET has been designed for easy installation and use on a stand-alone laptop or workstation. It
incorporates a variety of available standards from organizations such as NIST, NERC, Transportation
Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and others. When the tool user
selects one or more of the standards, CSET will open a set of questions to be answered. The answers to
these questions will be compared against a selected security assurance level, and a detailed report will be
generated to show areas for potential improvement. CSET provides an excellent means to perform a selfassessment of the security posture of your control system environment.

International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committees 65 and 57
http://www.iec.ch/
IEC is a standards organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical,
electronic, and related technologies. These standards serve as a basis for creating national standards and
as references for drafting international tenders and contracts. IEC’s members include manufacturers,
providers, distributors, vendors, consumers, and users, all levels of governmental agencies, professional
societies, trade associations, and standards developers from over 60 countries.
In 2004 the IEC Technical Sub-Committee 65C (Industrial Networks), through its working group WG13
(cybersecurity), started to address security issues - within the IEC 61784 standard – for field buses and
other industrial communication networks. Results of this work are outlined in part 4, entitled “Digital data
communications for measurement and control – Profiles for secure communications in industrial
networks.”
TC65 WG10 is working to extend this field level communication to address security standards across
common automation networking scenarios. The standard being drafted as a result of this work is IEC
62443, entitled “Security for industrial process measurement and control – Network and system security.”
It is based on a modular security architecture consisting of requirement sets. These modules are mapped
into ICS component and network architecture. The resulting requirements can then be formulated for use
as the basis for Requests for Proposals (RFP) for data communication standards, and security audits.
TC 57 is focused on Power Systems Management and Associated Information Exchange and is divided

ISA99 Industrial Automation and Control Systems Security Standards
http://www.isa.org/isa99
The ISA99 standards development committee brings together industrial cybersecurity experts from across
the globe to develop ISA standards on industrial automation and control system (IACS) security. This
original and ongoing ISA99 work is being standardized by the IEC in producing the multi-standard IEC
62443 series. The committee’s focus is to improve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
components or systems used for automation or control and provides criteria for procuring and
implementing secure control systems. Compliance with the committee’s guidance will improve industrial
automation and control system electronic security, and will help identify vulnerabilities and address them,
thereby reducing the risk of compromising confidential information or causing industrial automation
control system degradation or failure.
All ISA-62443 standards and technical reports are organized into four general categories
called General, Policies and Procedures, System, and Component.
 General category includes common or foundational information such as concepts, models and
terminology. Also included are work products that describe security metrics and security life cycles
for IACS.
 Policies and Procedures category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various
aspects of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program.
 System category includes work products that describe system design guidance and requirements for
the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit design model.
 Component category includes work products that describe the specific product development and
technical requirements of control system products. This is primarily intended for control product
vendors, but can be used by integrator and asset owners for to assist in the procurement of secure
products.
The current status of the ISA-62443 documents is provided on the ISA99 Wiki at
http://isa99.isa.org/ISA99 Wiki/
General
 ISA-62443-1-1 (IEC/TS 62443-1-1) (formerly referred to as "ISA-99 Part 1") was originally
published as ISA standard ANSI/ISA-99.00.01-2007, as well as an IEC technical specification
IEC/TS 62443-1-1. The ISA99 committee is currently revising it to make it align with other
documents in the series, and to clarify normative content.
 ISA-TR62443-1-2 (IEC 62443-1-2) is a master glossary of terms used by the ISA99 committee. This
document is a working draft.
 ISA-62443-1-3 (IEC 62443-1-3) identifies a set of compliance metrics for IACS security. This
document is currently under development and the committee will be releasing a draft for comment in
2013.
 ISA-TR62443-1-4 (IEC/TS 62443-1-4) defines the IACS security life cycle and use case. This work
product has been proposed as part of the series, but as of January 2013 development had not yet
started.

ISO 27001
http://www.iso.org/, http://www.27000.org
ISO 27001 provides a model for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing,
maintaining and improving an Information Security Management System. The objective of the standard
itself is to "provide requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continuously improving
an Information Security Management System (ISMS).” Regarding its adoption, this should be a strategic
decision. Further, "The design and implementation of an organization's information security management
system is influenced by the organization's needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational
processes used and the size and structure of the organization.” The content sections of the standard
include:
 Context of the Organization.
 Information Security Leadership.
 Planning an ISMS.
 Support.
 Operation.
 Performance Evaluation.
 Improvement.
 Annex A – List of controls and their objectives.
The 2005 version of the standard heavily employed the Plan-Do-Check-Act model to structure the
processes, and reflect the principles set out in the OECG guidelines (see oecd.org). However, the latest,
2013 version, places more emphasis on measuring and evaluating how well an organization’s ISMS is
performing.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework
http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/index.cfm
Recognizing that the national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable
functioning of critical infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in February 2013 [83]. It directed NIST to work with stakeholders to
develop a voluntary framework – based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices – for reducing
cyber risks to critical infrastructure.
NIST released the first version of the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
on February 12, 2014 [83]. The Framework, created through collaboration between industry and
government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote the protection of critical
infrastructure. The prioritized, flexible, repeatable, and cost-effective approach of the Framework helps
owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage cybersecurity-related risk.
The Department of Homeland Security's Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community C³ Voluntary Program
helps align critical infrastructure owners and operators with existing resources that will assist their efforts
to adopt the Cybersecurity Framework and manage their cyber risks. Learn more about the C³ Voluntary
Program by visiting: www.dhs.gov/ccubedvp.
NIST has also issued a companion Roadmap that discusses NIST's next steps with the Framework and

As part of the continuing effort to provide effective security standards and guidance to federal agencies
and their contractors in support of the Federal Information Security Management Act and as part of the
effort to protect the nation's critical infrastructure, NIST continues to work with public and private sector
entities on sector-specific security issues.
Industrial and process control systems are an integral part of the US critical infrastructure and the
protection of those systems is a priority for the federal government. This project intends to build upon the
current FISMA security standards and provide targeted extensions and/or interpretations of those
standards for industrial and process controls systems where needed. Since many industrial and process
controls systems are supporting private sector organizations, NIST will collaborate with ongoing
standards efforts addressing these sector-specific types of systems.
NIST Cybersecurity for Manufacturing Systems Project
http://www.nist.gov/el/isd/cs/csms.cfm
Smart manufacturing systems need to be protected from vulnerabilities that may arise as a result of their
increased connectivity, use of wireless networks and sensors, and use of widespread information
technology. Manufacturers are hesitant to adopt common security technologies, such as encryption and
device authentication, due to concern for potential negative performance impacts in their systems. This is
exacerbated by a threat environment that has changed dramatically with the appearance of advanced
persistent attacks specifically targeting industrial systems, such as Stuxnet. This project will develop a
cybersecurity risk management framework with supporting guidelines, methods, metrics and tools to
enable manufacturers, technology providers, and solution providers to assess and assure cybersecurity for
smart manufacturing systems. The cybersecurity risk management framework and methodology will
stimulate manufacturer adoption and enable effective use of security technologies, leading to smart
manufacturing systems that offer security, reliability, resilience and continuity in the face of disruption
and major incidents.
NIST Cybersecurity for Smart Grid Systems Project

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Appendix E—ICS Security Capabilities and Tools
This section provides an overview of security capabilities that are available to or being developed in
support of the ICS community. There are several security products that are marketed specifically for ICS,
while others are general IT security products that are being used with ICS. Many of the products available
offer “single point solutions,” where a single security product offers multiple levels of protection. In
addition to available products, this section also discusses some research and development work towards
new products and technologies. Each organization should make a risk-based determination whether to
employ the security capabilities and tools mentioned in this appendix.
Data Diode
A data diode (also referred to as a unidirectional gateway, deterministic one-way boundary device or
unidirectional network) is a network appliance or device allowing data to travel only in one direction,
used in guaranteeing information security or protection of critical digital systems, such as industrial
control systems, from inbound cyber attacks. While use of these devices is common in high security
environments such as defense, where they serve as connections between two or more networks of
differing security classifications, the technology is also being used to enforce one-way communications
outbound from critical digital systems to untrusted networks.
Encryption
Encryption protects the confidentiality of data by encoding the data to ensure that only the intended
recipient can decode it. There are some commercially available encryption products designed specifically
for ICS applications, as well as general encryption products that support basic serial and Ethernet-based
communications.
Firewalls
Firewalls are commonly used to segregate networks to protect and isolate ICS. These implementations
use commercially available firewalls that are focused on Internet and corporate application layer protocols
and are not equipped to handle ICS protocols. Research was performed by an IT security vendor in 2003
to develop a Modbus-based firewall that allows policy decisions to be made on Modbus/TCP header
values just as traditional firewalls filter on TCP/UDP ports and IP addresses [76]. There are currently
several firewalls available for ICS.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are being deployed on ICS
networks and components to detect well-known cyber attacks. Network IDS products monitor network
traffic and use various detection methods, such as comparing portions of the traffic to signatures of
known attacks. In contrast, host intrusion detection uses software loaded on a host computer, often with
attack signatures, to monitor ongoing events and data on a computer system for possible exploits. IPS
products take intrusion detection a step further by automatically acting on detected exploits to attempt to
stop them [57].
The required task of a security team to constantly monitor, evaluate, and quickly respond to intrusion
detection events is sometimes contracted to a managed security service provider (MSSP). MSSPs have
correlation and analysis engines to process and reduce the vast amounts of events logged per day to a
small subset that needs to be manually evaluated. There are also correlation and analysis engine products
available to large organizations wanting to perform this function in-house. Security information and event

E-1

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

management (SIEM) products are used in some organizations to monitor, analyze, and correlate events
from IDS and IPS logs, as well as audit logs from other computer systems, applications, infrastructure
equipment, and other hardware and software, to look for intrusion attempts.
IDS and IPS vendors are developing and incorporating attack signatures for various ICS protocols such as
Modbus, DNP3, and ICCP [58]. Snort rules have been developed for Modbus TCP, DNP3, and ICCP.
Snort is an open source network intrusion detection and prevention system using a rule-driven language to
perform signature, protocol, and anomaly-based inspections. Rules for DNP3 and Modbus protocols have
also been added to the Bro IDS platform.
As with any software added to an ICS component, the addition of host IDS or IPS software could affect
system performance. IPSs are commonplace in today’s information security industry, but can be very
resource intensive. These systems have the ability to automatically reconfigure systems if an intrusion
attempt is identified. This automated and fast reaction is designed to prevent successful exploits; however,
an automated tool such as this could be used by an adversary to adversely affect the operation on an ICS
by shutting down segments of a network or server. False positives can also hinder ICS operation.
Malware/Antivirus Software
Because early malware threats were primarily viruses, the software to detect and remove malware has
historically been called “antivirus software,” even though it can detect many types of malware. Antivirus
software is used to counter the threats of malware by evaluating files on a computer’s storage devices
(some tools also detect malware in real-time at the network perimeter and/or on the user’s workstation)
against an inventory of malware signature files. If one of the files on a computer matches the profile of
known malware, the malware is removed through a disinfection process so it cannot infect other local
files or communicate across a network to infect other files on other computers. There are also techniques
available to identify unknown malware “in-the-wild” when a signature file is not yet available.
Many end-users and vendors of ICS are recommending the use of COTS antivirus software with their
systems and have even developed installation and configuration guidance based on their own laboratory
testing. Some ICS vendors recommend the use of antivirus software with their products, but offer little to
no guidance. Some end users and vendors are hesitant to use antivirus software due to fears that its use
would cause ICS performance problems or even failure. NIST and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)
conducted a study and produced a report aimed at helping ICS owners/operators to deploy antivirus
software and to minimize and assess performance impacts of workstation and server-based antivirus
products. This study assembled ICS-based antivirus knowledge and serves as a starting point or a
secondary resource when installing, configuring, running, and maintaining antivirus software on an ICS
[56]. In many cases, performance impacts can be reduced through configuration settings as well as
antivirus scanning and maintenance scheduling outside of the antivirus software practices recommended
for typical IT systems.
In summary, COTS antivirus software can be used successfully on most ICS components. However,
special ICS specific considerations should be taken into account during the selection, installation,
configuration, operational, and maintenance procedures. ICS end-users should consult with the ICS
vendors regarding the use of antivirus software.

Vulnerability Assessment Tools
There are many tools available for performing network vulnerability assessments for typical IT networks;
however, the impacts these tools may have on the operation of an ICS should be carefully considered
[77]. The additional traffic and exploits used during active vulnerability and penetration testing, combined
with the limited resources of many ICS, have been known to cause ICS to malfunction. As guidance in
this area, SNL developed a preferred list of vulnerability and penetration testing techniques for ICS [77].
These are less intrusive methods, passive instead of active, to collect the majority of information that is
often queried by automated vulnerability and penetration testing tools. These methods are intended to
allow collection of the necessary vulnerability information without the risk of causing a failure while
testing.
Sophia is a patent-pending, passive, real-time diagnostic and security tool designed and built specifically
for control systems professionals. Sophia builds and maintains an ICS network fingerprint and
continuously monitors activity against it, with white, gray and black-listing capabilities, alerting its
managers of any abnormal activity for further investigation, monitoring and/or action. Beta testing
conducted by the Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA) at the Idaho National Laboratories (INL) recently
concluded with a group of over 30 participants, including major utilities and control system vendors.
Those Beta participants reported immediate benefits in the fingerprinting process and longer-term benefits
in monitoring, securing, and making on-going modifications to ICS configurations during the Beta testing
period. Beta participants, as well as non-participants, who have been following the development of
Sophia by BEA/INL, have long expressed interest in obtaining commercial grade Sophia software,
services and support. Beta testing has proven that this suite of tools offers unique capabilities, including
visualization of activity and tailored reporting to meet customer needs.
Shodan is a search engine that lets you find specific types of computers (routers, servers, etc.) on the
Internet using a variety of filters. Some have also described it as a search engine of service banners, which
are meta-data the server sends back to the client. This can be information about the server software, what
options the service supports, a welcome message or anything else that the client can find out before
interacting with the server. Shodan users are able to find systems including traffic lights, security
cameras, home heating systems as well as control systems. Users can use Shodan to determine if any of
the devices on their ICS are accessible from the internet.
The Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) product that
assists organizations in protecting their key national cyber assets. It was developed under the direction of
the DHS Industrial Control System Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) by cybersecurity
experts and with assistance from NIST. This tool provides users with a systematic and repeatable
approach for assessing the security posture of their cyber systems and networks. It includes both highlevel and detailed questions related to all industrial control and IT systems. CSET is a desktop software
tool that guides users through a step-by-step process to assess their control system and information
technology network security practices against recognized industry standards. The output from CSET is a
prioritized list of recommendations for improving the cybersecurity posture of the organization's
enterprise and industrial control cyber systems. The tool derives the recommendations from a database of
cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices. Each recommendation is linked to a set of actions that
can be applied to enhance cybersecurity controls. CSET has been designed for easy installation and use
on a stand-alone laptop or workstation. It incorporates a variety of available standards from organizations
such as NIST, NERC, TSA, DoD, and others. When the tool user selects one or more of the standards,
CSET will open a set of questions to be answered. The answers to these questions will be compared
against a selected security assurance level, and a detailed report will be generated to show areas for
potential improvement. CSET provides an excellent means to perform a self-assessment of the security
posture of your control system environment.

SamuraiSTFU is the Samurai Project’s Security Testing Framework for Utilities and takes best in breed
security tools for traditional network and web penetration testing and adds specialized tools for embedded
and RF testing and mixes in energy sector context, documentation and sample files. It also includes
emulators for SCADA, Smart Meters, and other types of energy sector systems to provide leverage for a
full test lab.
ICS owners must make the individuals using vulnerability assessment tools aware of the criticality of
continuous operation and the risks involved with performing these tests on operational systems. It may be
possible to mitigate these risks by performing tests on ICS components such as redundant servers or
independent test systems in a laboratory setting. Laboratory tests can be used to screen out test procedures
that might harm the operational system. Even with very good configuration management to assure that the
test system is highly representative, tests on the actual system are likely to uncover flaws not represented
in the laboratory.

Appendix G—ICS Overlay
NOTE TO READERS

The ICS overlay is a partial tailoring of the controls and control baselines in SP 800-53, Revision 4, and adds
supplementary guidance specific to ICS. The concept of overlays is introduced in Appendix I of SP 800-53,
Revision 4. The ICS overlay is intended to be applicable to all ICS systems in all industrial sectors. Further
tailoring can be performed to add specificity to a particular sector (e.g., pipeline, energy). Ultimately, an
overlay may be produced for a specific system (e.g., the XYZ company). This ICS overlay constitutes
supplemental guidance and tailoring for SP 800-53, Revision 4. Please be sure you are looking at the correct
version of SP 800-53. Duplicating Appendix F of SP 800-53 would increase the size of this Appendix by
over 65 pages. Therefore, the drafting committee has decided to not duplicate Appendix F. The reader should
have SP 800-53, Revision 4 available. The authoring team also considered that this ICS overlay may serve as
a model for other overlays. Feedback on this Appendix’s structure would be appreciated, especially in the
following areas: the level of abstraction and whether the examples provided in the supplemental guidance are
sufficient/beneficial for implementation.
Since the ICS overlay exists in the context of SP 800-53, Revision 4, it is important to review that context. SP
800-53, Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,
represents the most comprehensive update to the security controls catalog since its inception in 2005. This
update was motivated principally by the expanding threat space—characterized by the increasing
sophistication of cyber attacks and the operations tempo of adversaries (i.e., the frequency of such attacks, the
professionalism of the attackers, and the persistence of targeting by attackers). State-of-the-practice security
controls and control enhancements have been developed and integrated into the catalog addressing such areas
as: mobile and cloud computing; applications security; trustworthiness, assurance, and resiliency of
information systems; insider threat; supply chain security; and the advanced persistent threat.
To take advantage of the expanded set of security and privacy controls, and to give organizations greater
flexibility and agility in defending their information systems, the concept of overlays was introduced in this
revision. Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor security control baselines and
develop specialized security plans that can be applied to specific missions/business functions, environments
of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization approach is important as the number of threat-driven
controls and control enhancements in the catalog increases and organizations develop risk management
strategies to address their specific protection needs within defined risk tolerances.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Identification
This overlay may be referenced as the NIST Special Publication 800-82 Revision 2 Industrial Control
System Overlay (“NIST SP 800-82 Rev 2 ICS Overlay”). It is based on NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 [22].
NIST developed this overlay in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information
Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 (Public Law 113-283), Presidential Policy Directive
(PPD)-21 and Executive Order 13636. NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations
and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the
express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. Comments
may be directed to icsoverlaycomments@nist.gov.
Overlay Characteristics
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are typically used in industries such as electric, water and wastewater,
oil and natural gas, transportation, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and
discrete manufacturing (e.g., automotive, aerospace, and durable goods). Supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) systems are generally used to control dispersed assets using centralized data
acquisition and supervisory control. Distributed Control Systems (DCS) are generally used to control
production systems within a local area such as a factory using supervisory and regulatory control.
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are generally used for discrete control for specific applications
and generally provide regulatory control. These control systems are vital to the operation of the U.S.
critical infrastructures that are often highly interconnected and mutually dependent systems. It is
important to note that approximately 90 percent of the nation's critical infrastructures are privately owned
and operated. Federal agencies also operate many of the ICS mentioned above; other examples include air
traffic control and materials handling (e.g., Postal Service mail handling.)
Applicability
The purpose of this overlay is to provide guidance for securing ICS, including SCADA and DCS systems,
PLCs, and other systems performing industrial control functions. This overlay has been prepared for use
by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis.
Overlay Summary
Table G-1 provides a summary of the security controls and control enhancements from NIST SP 800-53
Appendix F [22, App. F] that have been allocated to the initial security control baselines (i.e., Low,
Moderate, and High) along with indications of ICS Supplemental Guidance and ICS tailoring. Controls
and control enhancements for which there is ICS Supplemental Guidance are bolded. If the control
baselines are supplemented by the addition of a control to the baseline, the control or control
enhancement is underlined. If a control or control enhancement is removed from the baseline, the control
or control enhancement is struck out.
Example:
AU-4

Audit Storage Capacity

AU-4 (1)

AU-4 (1)

AU-4 (1)

In this example, ICS Supplemental Guidance was added to Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4 (bolded). In
addition, Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4 was added to the Low, Moderate (Mod), and High baselines
(underlined).

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Tailoring Considerations
Due to the unique characteristics of ICS, these systems may require a greater use of compensating
security controls than is the case for general purpose information systems. Compensating controls are not
exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls; rather, they are alternative safeguards and countermeasures
employed within the ICS that accomplish the intent of the original security controls that could not be
effectively employed. See “Selecting Compensating Security Controls” in section 3.2 of NIST SP 800-53
Rev. 4 [22].
In situations where the ICS cannot support, or the organization determines it is not advisable to
implement, particular security controls or control enhancements in an ICS (e.g., performance, safety, or
reliability are adversely impacted), the organization provides a complete and convincing rationale for how
the selected compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or level of protection for the
ICS and why the related baseline security controls could not be employed.
In accordance with the Technology-related Considerations of the Scoping Guidance in NIST SP 800-53
Rev. 4, section 3.2, if automated mechanisms are not readily available, cost-effective, or technically
feasible in the ICS, compensating security controls, implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or
procedures are employed [22].
Compensating controls are alternative security controls employed by organizations in lieu of specific
controls in the baselines—controls that provide equivalent or comparable protection for organizational
information systems and the information processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. 42 This may
occur, for example, when organizations are unable to effectively implement specific security controls in
the baselines or when, due to the specific nature of the ICS or environments of operation, the controls in
the baselines are not a cost-effective means of obtaining the needed risk mitigation. Compensating
controls may include control enhancements that supplement the baseline. Using compensating controls
may involve a trade-off between additional risk and reduced functionality. Every use of compensating
controls should involve a risk-based determination of: (i) how much residual risk to accept, and (ii) how
much functionality should be reduced. Compensating controls may be employed by organizations under
the following conditions:
 Organizations select compensating controls from NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, Appendix F. If appropriate
compensating controls are not available, organizations adopt suitable compensating controls from
other sources 43
 Organizations provide supporting rationale for how compensating controls provide equivalent
security capabilities for organizational information systems and why the baseline security controls
could not be employed.
 Organizations assess and accept the risk associated with implementing compensating controls in ICS.
Organizational decisions on the use of compensating controls are documented in the security plan for the
ICS.

42

More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent protection for a particular security control in
Appendix F. For example, organizations with significant staff limitations may compensate for the separation of duty security
control by strengthening the audit, accountability, and personnel security controls.
43
Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the security control catalog in Appendix F.
Organization-defined compensating controls are employed only when organizations determine that the security control
catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls.

G-9

SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82 REVISION 2

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Controls that contain assignments (e.g., Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger events)
may be tailored out of the baseline. This is equivalent to assigning a value of “none.” The assignment may
take on different values for different impact baselines.
Non-Addressable and Non-Routable Communications
The unique network properties within ICS warrant specific attention when applying certain security
controls. Many of the controls in NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 that pertain to communication, devices, and
interfaces implicitly assume the applicability of addressable and routable protocols such as the TCP/IP
Internet protocol suite44 or layers 1, 2, and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (ISO/IEC
7498-1). Some devices, or subsystems, used in ICS are exceptions to this assumption. This section
addresses how the controls may be appropriately tailored. Tailoring is primarily required due to the
following situations:
 Capabilities not present. The intent of certain controls may be more easily achieved through
compensating controls due to certain network properties or capabilities not existing in the ICS
subsystem. For example, physical protections (e.g., locked cabinets) may be used to secure an entire
point-to-point communication channel as a means to compensate for a lack of protocols that support
authentication. Security controls may warrant additional supplemental guidance to help ensure the
implementation of the control or compensating control provides the appropriate level of protection.
 Non-applicable security controls. Many communication protocols found within an ICS may have
limited functionality (e.g., not addressable or routable). Security controls dealing with addressing and
routing may not be applicable to these protocols.
Security controls for devices that communicate point-to-point using standards and protocols that do not
include addressing generally require tailoring. A modem connected to a computer through an RS-232
interface is an example. RS-232 was commonly employed in ICS equipment that is currently in use, even
if it has been superseded in newer equipment. In telecommunications, RS-232 is the traditional name for a
series of standards for serial binary single-ended data and control signals connecting between DTE (data
terminal equipment) and DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment, originally defined as data
communication equipment). The current version of the standard is Telecommunications Industry
Association (TIA)-232-F, Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating
Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange, issued in 1997.
An RS-232 serial port was once a standard feature of small computing devices, such as ICS subsystems,
used for connections to peripheral devices. However, the low transmission speed, large voltage swing,
and large standard connectors motivated development of the Universal Serial Bus (USB), which has
displaced RS-232 from most of its peripheral interface roles. RS-232 devices are still found, especially in
industrial machines, networking equipment, and scientific instruments.
Layered Network Models
The layered network models used in both TCP/IP and OSI can provide a basis for understanding the
various properties of network communications and will help identify how security controls can be
appropriately applied to systems and networks. The following table introduces key properties about the
physical, data link, and network layers regarding the application of security controls.

44

Currently, the Internet Engineering Task Force, or IETF, manages the TCP/IP protocol suite.

GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS) SECURITY

Layer properties
Physical Medium – A network’s physical medium, specifically whether it’s
wired or wireless can drive the application/tailoring of certain controls.
Wireless connections cannot be physically protected; therefore, compensating
controls focusing on physical security cannot be used.
Topology – The physical topologies may also determine how controls are
tailored. For example point-to-point topologies (e.g., RS-232) generally do not
need physically addressable interfaces, while multipoint topologies (e.g., IEEE
802.3 Ethernet) do require physically addressable interfaces.
Physically Addressable – Multipoint protocols require physically addressable
interfaces to allow for multiple systems to communicate. Systems that are not
physically addressable can only be accessed by those systems with which it
shared point-to-point connections.
Network Addressable/Routable – Network addressable/routable systems can be
accessed by any system on an internetwork. That is, communications can be
routed between networks. If a system is not network addressable/routable, it can
only be accessed by systems with which it shares a local network connection.

Detailed Overlay Control Specifications
This Overlay is based on the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal
Information Systems and Organizations, which provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for
federal information systems and organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect
organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats including hostile cyber
attacks, natural disasters, structural failures, and human errors (both intentional and unintentional). The
security and privacy controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process
that manages information security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and
privacy requirements across the federal government and critical infrastructure, derived from legislation,
Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or mission/business needs. The
publication also describes how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, tailored for specific
types of missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the catalog of
security controls addresses security from both a functionality perspective (the strength of security
functions and mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective (the measures of confidence in the
implemented security capability). Addressing both security functionality and assurance helps to ensure
that information technology component products and the information systems built from those products
using sound system and security engineering principles are sufficiently trustworthy.
In preparation for selecting and specifying the appropriate security controls for organizational information
systems and their respective environments of operation, organizations first determine the criticality and
sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. This process is
known as security categorization. FIPS 199 [15] enables federal agencies to establish security categories
for both information and information systems. Other documents, such as those produced by ISA and
CNSS, also provide guidance for defining low, moderate, and high levels of security based on impact.
The security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization or on people (employees
and/or the public) should certain events occur which jeopardize the information and information systems
needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal
responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals’ safety, health and life. Security
categories are to be used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the risk to
an organization.
This overlay provides ICS Supplemental Guidance for the security controls and control enhancements
prescribed for an information system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of its information and to meet a set of defined security requirements. This overlay
contains a tailoring of the security control baselines; its specification may be more stringent or less
stringent than the original security control baseline specification and can be applied to multiple
information systems. This overlay is high-level, applicable to all ICS; it may be used as the basis for more
specific overlays. Use cases for specific systems in specific environments may be separately published
(e.g., as a NISTIR).

Control Enhancement: (1) ICS Supplemental Guidance: Legacy ICS typically are typically
configured with remote storage on a separate information system (e.g., the historian in the DMZ
accumulates historical operational ICS data and is backed up for storage at a different site). ICS are
currently using online backup services and increasingly moving to Cloud based and Virtualized
services. Retention of some data (e.g., SCADA telemetry) may be required by regulatory authorities.

Rationale for adding control to baseline: Legacy ICS components typically do not have capacity to
store or analyze audit data. The retention periods for some data, particularly compliance data, may
require large volumes of storage.

ACCESS CONTROL – AC
Tailoring Considerations for Access Control Family

Before implementing controls in the AC family, consider the tradeoffs among security, privacy, latency,
performance, throughput, and reliability. For example, the organization considers whether latency induced from the
use of confidentiality and integrity mechanisms employing cryptographic mechanisms would adversely impact the
operational performance of the ICS.
In situations where the ICS cannot support the specific Access Control requirements of a control, the
organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance. Examples of
compensating controls are given with each control, as appropriate.

be external if that system performs different functions, implements different policies, comes under different
managers, or does not provide sufficient visibility into the implementation of security controls to allow the
establishment of a satisfactory trust relationship. For example, a process control system and a business data
processing system would typically be considered external to each other. Access to an ICS for support by a business
partner, such as a vendor or support contractor, is another common example. The definition and trustworthiness of

where operational elements involved in cybersecurity and communications reliance are coordinated and integrated.
The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/ics-cert/
collaborates with international and private sector Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) to share control
systems-related security incidents and mitigation measures. Organizations should consider having both an
unclassified and classified information sharing capability.
Rationale for adding AC-21 to low baseline: ICS systems provide essential services and control functions and are
often connected to other ICS systems or business systems that can be vectors of attack. It is therefore necessary to
provide a uniform defense encompassing all baselines.

ICS Supplemental Guidance: Ports, as used in NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, are part of the address space in network
protocols and are often associated with specific protocols or functions. As such, ports are not relevant to nonroutable protocols and devices. When dealing with non-routable and non-addressable protocols and devices,
prohibiting or restricting the use of specified functions, protocols, and/or services must be implemented for the
(sub)system granularity that is available (e.g., at a low level, interrupts could be disabled; at a high level, set points
could be made read-only except for privileged users). Example compensating controls include employing
nonautomated mechanisms or procedures.
Control Enhancement: (1, 2, 5) No ICS Supplemental Guidance.
Control Baseline Supplement Rationale: (1) Periodic review and removal of unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions,
ports, protocols, and services are added to the LOW baseline because many of the LOW impact ICS components could adversely
affect the systems to which they are connected.
(4, 5) Whitelisting (CE 5) is more effective than blacklisting (CE 4). The set of applications that run in ICS is essentially
static, making whitelisting practical. ICS-CERT recommends deploying application whitelisting on ICS. Reference: http://ics-cert.uscert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B

ICS systems often contain a physical component at a fixed location. Such components may not be relocated
logically. Some replacement components may not be readily available. Continuance of essential missions and
business functions with little or no loss of operational continuity may not be possible. In situations where the
organization cannot provide necessary essential services, support, or automated mechanisms during contingency
operations, the organization provides nonautomated mechanisms or predetermined procedures as compensating
controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each

ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization defines contingency plans for categories of disruptions or
failures. In the event of a loss of processing within the ICS or communication with operational facilities, the ICS
executes predetermined procedures (e.g., alert the operator of the failure and then do nothing, alert the operator and
then safely shut down the industrial process, alert the operator and then maintain the last operational setting prior to
failure).
Control Enhancement: (1) ICS Supplemental Guidance: Organizational elements responsible for related plans may
include suppliers such as electric power, fuel, fresh water and wastewater.
Control Enhancement: (2) No ICS Supplemental Guidance.
Control Enhancement: (3, 4) ICS Supplemental Guidance: Plans for the resumption of essential missions and
business functions, and for resumption of all missions and business functions take into account the effects of the
disruption on the environment of operation. Restoration and resumption plans should include prioritization of
efforts. Disruptions may affect the quality and quantity of resources in the environment, such as electric power, fuel,
fresh water and wastewater, and the ability of these suppliers to also resume provision of essential mission and
business functions. Contingency plans for widespread disruption may involve specialized organizations (e.g.,
FEMA, emergency services, regulatory authorities). Reference: NFPA 1600: Standard on Disaster/Emergency
Management and Business Continuity Programs.

ICS Supplemental Guidance: Reconstitution of the ICS includes consideration whether system state variables
should be restored to initial values or values before disruption (e.g., are valves restored to full open, full closed, or
settings prior to disruption). Restoring system state variables may be disruptive to ongoing physical processes (e.g.,
valves initially closed may adversely affect system cooling).

ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization-defined conditions and corresponding restrictions of safe mode
of operation may vary among baselines. The same condition(s) may trigger different response depending on the
impact level. The conditions may be external to the ICS (e.g., electricity supply brown-out). Related controls: SI-17.
Rationale for adding CP-12 to all baselines: This control provides a framework for the organization to plan their
policy and procedures for dealing with conditions beyond their control in the environment of operations. Creating a
written record of the decision process for selecting incidents and appropriate response is part of risk management in
light of changing environment of operations.

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION - IA
Tailoring Considerations for Identification and Authentication Family

Before implementing controls in the IA family, consider the tradeoffs among security, privacy, latency,
performance, and throughput. For example, the organization considers whether latency induced from the use of
authentication mechanisms employing cryptographic mechanisms would adversely impact the operational
performance of the ICS.
In situations where the ICS cannot support the specific Identification and Authentication requirements of a
control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
Examples of compensating controls are given with each control, as appropriate.

ICS Supplemental Guidance: Where users function as a single group (e.g., control room operators), user
identification and authentication may be role-based, group-based, or device-based. For certain ICS, the capability for
immediate operator interaction is critical. Local emergency actions for ICS are not hampered by identification or
authentication requirements. Access to these systems may be restricted by appropriate physical security controls.
Example compensating controls include providing increased physical security, personnel security, and auditing
measures. For example, manual voice authentication of remote personnel and local, manual actions may be required
in order to establish a remote access. See AC-17 ICS Supplemental Guidance. Local user access to ICS components
is enabled only when necessary, approved, and authenticated.

ATTESTATION

ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization may permit connection of devices, also known as non-person
entities (NPE), belonging to and authorized by another organization (e.g., business partners) to their ICS. Especially
when these devices are non-local, their identification and authentication can be vital. Organizations may perform
risk and impact analysis to determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms. Example compensating
controls for devices and protocols which do not provide authentication for remote network connections, include
implementing physical security measures.
Control Enhancement: (1, 4) ICS Supplemental Guidance: Configuration management for NPE identification and
authentication customarily involves a human surrogate or representative for the NPE. Devices are provided with
their identification and authentication credentials based on assertions by the human surrogate. The human surrogate
also responds to events and anomalies (e.g., credential expiration). Credentials for software entities (e.g.,
autonomous processes not associated with a specific person) based on properties of that software (e.g., digital
signatures) may change every time the software is changed or patched. Special purpose hardware (e.g., custom
integrated circuits and printed-circuit boards) may exhibit similar dependencies. Organization definition of
parameters may be different among the impact levels.
Rationale (applies to control and control enhancements): ICS may exchange information with many external
systems and devices. Identifying and authenticating the devices introduces situations that do not exist with humans.
These controls include assignments that enable the organization to categorize devices by types, models, or other
group characteristics. Assignments also enable the organizations to select appropriate controls for local, remote, and
network connections.

ICS Supplemental Guidance: Emergency power production, transmission and distribution systems are a type of
ICS that are required to meet extremely high performance specifications. The systems are governed by international,
national, state and local building codes, must be tested on a continual basis, and must be repaired and placed back
into operations within a short period of time. Traditionally, emergency power has been provided by generators for
short to mid-term power (typically for fire and life safety systems, some IT load, and evacuation transport) and UPS
battery packs in distribution closets and within work areas to allow some level of business continuity and for the
orderly shutdown of non-essential IT and facility systems. Traditional emergency power systems typically are offline until a loss of power occurs and are typically on a separate network and control system specific to the facility
they support. New methods of energy generation and storage (e.g., solar voltaic, geothermal, flywheel, microgrid,
distributed energy) that have a real-time demand and storage connection to local utilities or cross connected to
multiple facilities should be carefully analyzed to ensure that the power can meet the load and signal quality without
disruption of mission essential functions.

designed to manage the quantity/flow and pressure of water. As ICS and IS become interconnected and the network
provides connectivity across the hybrid domain, power circuits, distribution closets, routers and switches that
support fire protection and life safety systems should ensure that water will not disable the system (e.g. a fire that
activates the sprinkler system does not spray onto the fire control servers, router, switches and short out the alarms,

ICS Supplemental Guidance: Active vulnerability scanning, which introduces network traffic, is used with care
on ICS systems to ensure that ICS functions are not adversely impacted by the scanning process. The organization
makes a risk-based determination whether to employ active scanning. Passive monitoring /sniffing may be used as
part of a compensating control. Example compensating controls include providing a replicated, virtualized, or
simulated system to conduct scanning. Production ICS may need to be taken off-line before scanning can be
conducted. If ICS are taken off-line for scanning, scans are scheduled to occur during planned ICS outages
whenever possible. If vulnerability scanning tools are used on non-ICS networks, extra care is taken to ensure that
they do not scan the ICS network. Network scanning is not applicable to non-addressable communications.
Vulnerability examination may be performed using other mechanisms than scanning to identify the objects being
examined. Host-based vulnerability examination is an example compensating control.

SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION - SC

Tailoring Considerations for System and Communications Protection Family
The use of cryptography is determined after careful consideration of the security needs and the potential
ramifications on system performance. For example, the organization considers whether latency induced from the use
of cryptography would adversely impact the operational performance of the ICS. While the legacy devices
commonly found within ICS often lack direct support of cryptographic functions, compensating controls (e.g.,
encapsulations) may be used to meet the intent of the control.
In situations where the ICS cannot support the specific System and Communications Protection
requirements of a control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring
guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control, as appropriate.

ICS Supplemental Guidance: Flaw Remediation is complicated since many ICS employ operating systems and
other software that is not current, is no longer being maintained by the vendors, and is not resistant to current threats.
ICS operators are often dependent on product vendors to validate the operability of a patch and also sometimes to
perform the installation. Often flaws cannot be remediated based on circumstances outside of the ICS operator's
control (e.g., lack of a vendor patch). Sometime the organization has no choice but to accept additional risk. In these
situations, compensating controls should be implemented (e.g., limit the exposure of the vulnerable system). Other
compensating controls that do not decrease the residual risk but increase the ability to respond may be desirable
(e.g., provide a timely response in case of an incident; devise a plan to ensure the ICS can identify the exploitation
of the flaw). Testing flaw remediation in an ICS may require more resources than the organization can commit.
Control Enhancement: (1) No ICS Supplemental Guidance.
Control Enhancement: (2) ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of

ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization determines whether the use of integrity verification applications
would adversely impact the operation of the ICS and employs compensating controls (e.g., manual integrity
verifications that do not affect performance.
Control Enhancements: (1) ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization ensures that the use of integrity
verification applications does not adversely impact the operational performance of the ICS.
Control Enhancement: (2) ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the organization cannot employ
automated tools that provide notification of integrity discrepancies, the organization employs nonautomated
mechanisms or procedures. Example compensating controls include performing scheduled manual inspections for
integrity violations.
Control Enhancement: (5) ICS Supplemental Guidance: The shutting down and restarting of the ICS may not
always be feasible upon the identification of an anomaly; these actions should be scheduled according to ICS
operational requirements.
Control Enhancement: (7) ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot detect unauthorized
security-relevant changes, the organization employs compensating controls (e.g., manual procedures) in accordance

ICS Supplemental Guidance: ICS spam protection may be implemented by removing spam transport
mechanisms, functions and services (e.g., electronic mail, Internet access) from the ICS. If any spam transport
mechanisms, functions and services are present in the ICS, spam protection in ICS takes into account operational
characteristics of ICS that differ from general purpose information systems, (e.g., unusual traffic flow that may be
misinterpreted and detected as spam. Example compensating controls include whitelist mail transfer agents (MTA),
digitally signed messages, acceptable sources, and acceptable message types.

Predictable Failure Prevention

ICS Supplemental Guidance: Failures in ICS can be stochastic or deterministic. Stochastic failures can be
analyzed using probability theory, while analysis of deterministic failures is based on non-random properties of the
system. Known ICS failure modes and causes are considered. The calculation and use of statistical descriptors, such
as Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), should incorporate additional analysis to determine how those failures manifest
within the cyber and physical domains. Knowledge of these possible manifestations may be necessary to detect
whether a failure has occurred within the ICS, as failures of the information systems may not be easily identifiable.
Emergent properties, which may arise both within the information systems and physical processes, can potentially
cause system failures should be incorporated into the analysis. For example, cumulative effects of resource
exhaustion (e.g., memory leakage) or errors (e.g., rounding and truncation) can occur when ICS processes execute
for unexpectedly long periods. Deterministic failures (e.g., integer counter overflow), once identified, are
preventable.
Often substitute components may not be available or may not be sufficient to protect against faults
occurring before predicted failure. Non-automated mechanisms or physical safeguards should be in place in order to
protect against these failures.
In addition to information concerning newly discovered vulnerabilities (i.e., latent flaws) potentially
affecting the system/applications that are discovered by forensic studies, new vulnerabilities may be identified by
organizations with responsibility for disseminating vulnerability information (e.g., ICS-CERT) based upon an
analysis of a similar pattern of incidents reported to them or vulnerabilities reported by other researchers.
Related controls: IR-5, IR-6, RA-5, SI-2, SI-5, SI-11.
Rationale for adding control to baseline: ICS are designed and built with certain boundary conditions, design
parameters, and assumptions about their environment and mode of operation. ICS may run much longer than
conventional systems, allowing latent flaws to become effective that are not manifest in other environments. For
example, integer overflow might never occur in systems that are re-initialized more frequently than the occurrence
of the overflow. Experience and forensic studies of anomalies and incidents in ICS can lead to identification of
emergent properties that were previously unknown, unexpected, or unanticipated. Preventative and restorative

ICS Supplemental Guidance: The selected failure conditions and corresponding procedures may vary among
baselines. The same failure event may trigger different response depending on the impact level. Mechanical and
analog system can be used to provide mechanisms to ensure fail-safe procedures. Fail-safe states should incorporate
potential impacts to human safety, physical systems, and the environment. Related controls: CP-6.
Rationale for adding SI-17 to all baselines: This control provides a structure for the organization to identify their
policy and procedures for dealing with failures and other incidents. Creating a written record of the decision process
for selecting incidents and appropriate response is part of risk management in light of changing environment of
operations.
