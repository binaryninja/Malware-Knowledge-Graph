Today, we’re sharing more about cyberattacks we’ve seen from a Russian nation-state actor
targeting Ukraine and steps we’ve taken to disrupt it.
We recently observed attacks targeting Ukrainian entities from Strontium, a Russian GRUconnected actor we have tracked for years. This week, we were able to disrupt some of
Strontium’s attacks on targets in Ukraine. On Wednesday April 6th, we obtained a court
order authorizing us to take control of seven internet domains Strontium was using to
conduct these attacks. We have since re-directed these domains to a sinkhole controlled by
Microsoft, enabling us to mitigate Strontium’s current use of these domains and enable victim
notifications.
Strontium was using this infrastructure to target Ukrainian institutions including media
organizations. It was also targeting government institutions and think tanks in the United
States and the European Union involved in foreign policy. We believe Strontium was
attempting to establish long-term access to the systems of its targets, provide tactical
support for the physical invasion and exfiltrate sensitive information. We have notified
Ukraine’s government about the activity we detected and the action we’ve taken.

This disruption is part of an ongoing long-term investment, started in 2016, to take legal and
technical action to seize infrastructure being used by Strontium. We have established a legal
process that enables us to obtain rapid court decisions for this work. Prior to this week, we
had taken action through this process 15 times to seize control of more than 100 Strontium
controlled domains.
The Strontium attacks are just a small part of the activity we have seen in Ukraine. Before
the Russian invasion, our teams began working around the clock to help organizations in
Ukraine, including government agencies, defend against an onslaught of cyberwarfare that
has escalated since the invasion began and has continued relentlessly. Since then, we have
observed nearly all of Russia’s nation-state actors engaged in the ongoing full-scale
offensive against Ukraine’s government and critical infrastructure, and we continue to work
closely with government and organizations of all kinds in Ukraine to help them defend
against this onslaught. In the coming weeks we expect to provide a more comprehensive
look at the scope of the cyberwar in Ukraine.
