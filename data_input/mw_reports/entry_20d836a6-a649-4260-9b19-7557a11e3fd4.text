A moment of reckoning: the need for a strong and global
cybersecurity response

December 18, 2020

The final weeks of a challenging year have proven even more difficult with the recent
exposure of the world’s latest serious nation-state cyberattack. This latest cyber-assault is
effectively an attack on the United States and its government and other critical institutions,
including security firms. It illuminates the ways the cybersecurity landscape continues to
evolve and become even more dangerous. As much as anything, this attack provides a
moment of reckoning. It requires that we look with clear eyes at the growing threats we face
and commit to more effective and collaborative leadership by the government and the tech
sector in the United States to spearhead a strong and coordinated global cybersecurity
response.
The evolving threats
The past 12 months have produced a watershed year with evolving cybersecurity threats on
three eye-opening fronts.
The first is the continuing rise in the determination and sophistication of nation-state
attacks. In the past week this has again burst into the headlines with the story of an attack
on the firm FireEye using malware inserted into network management software provided to
customers by the tech company SolarWinds. This has already led to subsequent news

reports of penetration into multiple parts of the U.S. Government. We should all be prepared
for stories about additional victims in the public sector and other enterprises and
organizations. As FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia stated after disclosing the recent attack, “We
are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities.”
As Microsoft cybersecurity experts assist in the response, we have reached the same
conclusion. The attack unfortunately represents a broad and successful espionage-based
assault on both the confidential information of the U.S. Government and the tech tools used
by firms to protect them. The attack is ongoing and is being actively investigated and
addressed by cybersecurity teams in the public and private sectors, including Microsoft. As
our teams act as first responders to these attacks, these ongoing investigations reveal an
attack that is remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact.
There are broader ramifications as well, which are even more disconcerting. First, while
governments have spied on each other for centuries, the recent attackers used a technique
that has put at risk the technology supply chain for the broader economy. As SolarWinds has
reported, the attackers installed their malware into an upgrade of the company’s Orion
product that may have been installed by more than 17,000 customers.
The nature of the initial phase of the attack and the breadth of supply chain vulnerability is
illustrated clearly in the map below, which is based on telemetry from Microsoft’s Defender
Anti-Virus software. This identifies customers who use Defender and who installed versions
of SolarWinds’ Orion software containing the attackers’ malware. As this makes clear, this
aspect of the attack created a supply chain vulnerability of nearly global importance,
reaching many major national capitals outside Russia. This also illustrates the heightened
level of vulnerability in the United States.

The installation of this malware created an opportunity for the attackers to follow up and pick
and choose from among these customers the organizations they wanted to further attack,
which it appears they did in a narrower and more focused fashion. While investigations (and
the attacks themselves) continue, Microsoft has identified and has been working this week to
notify more than 40 customers that the attackers targeted more precisely and compromised
through additional and sophisticated measures.
While roughly 80% of these customers are located in the United States, this work so far has
also identified victims in seven additional countries. This includes Canada and Mexico in
North America; Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom in Europe; and Israel and the UAE
in the Middle East. It’s certain that the number and location of victims will keep growing.
Additional analysis sheds added light on the breadth of these attacks. The initial list of
victims includes not only government agencies, but security and other technology firms as
well as non-governmental organizations, as shown in the chart below.

It’s critical that we step back and assess the significance of these attacks in their full context.
This is not “espionage as usual,” even in the digital age. Instead, it represents an act of
recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the
world. In effect, this is not just an attack on specific targets, but on the trust and reliability of
the world’s critical infrastructure in order to advance one nation’s intelligence agency. While
the most recent attack appears to reflect a particular focus on the United States and many
other democracies, it also provides a powerful reminder that people in virtually every country
are at risk and need protection irrespective of the governments they live under.

As we have now seen repeatedly, Silicon Valley is not the only home of ingenious software
developers. Russian engineers in 2016 identified weaknesses in password protection and
social media platforms, hacked their way into American political campaigns, and used
disinformation to sow divisions among the electorate. They repeated the exercise in the 2017
French presidential campaign. As tracked by Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center and
Digital Crimes Unit, these techniques have impacted victims in more than 70 countries,
including most of the world’s democracies. The most recent attack reflects an unfortunate but
similarly ingenious capability to identify weaknesses in cybersecurity protection and exploit
them.
These types of sophisticated nation-state attacks are increasingly being compounded by
another technology trend, which is the opportunity to augment human capabilities with
artificial intelligence (AI). One of the more chilling developments this year has been what
appears to be new steps to use AI to weaponize large stolen datasets about individuals and
spread targeted disinformation using text messages and encrypted messaging apps. We
should all assume that, like the sophisticated attacks from Russia, this too will become a
permanent part of the threat landscape.
Thankfully, there is a limited number of governments that can invest in the talent needed to
attack with this level of sophistication. In our first Microsoft Digital Defense Report, released
in September, we reviewed our assessment of 14 nation-state groups involved in
cybersecurity attacks. Eleven of the 14 are in only three countries.
All this is changing because of a second evolving threat, namely the growing
privatization of cybersecurity attacks through a new generation of private companies,
akin to 21st-century mercenaries. This phenomenon has reached the point where it has
acquired its own acronym – PSOAs, for private sector offensive actors. Unfortunately, this is
not an acronym that will make the world a better place.
One illustrative company in this new sector is the NSO Group, based in Israel and now
involved in U.S. litigation. NSO created and sold to governments an app called Pegasus,
which could be installed on a device simply by calling the device via WhatsApp; the device’s
owner did not even have to answer. According to WhatsApp, NSO used Pegasus to access
more than 1,400 mobile devices, including those belonging to journalists and human rights
activists.
NSO represents the increasing confluence between sophisticated private-sector technology
and nation-state attackers. Citizen Lab, a research laboratory at the University of Toronto,
has identified more than 100 abuse cases regarding NSO alone. But it is hardly alone. Other
companies are increasingly rumored to be joining in what has become a new $12 billion
global technology market.

This represents a growing option for nation-states to either build or buy the tools needed for
sophisticated cyberattacks. And if there has been one constant in the world of software over
the past five decades, it is that money is always more plentiful than talent. An industry
segment that aids offensive cyberattacks spells bad news on two fronts. First, it adds even
more capability to the leading nation-state attackers, and second, it generates cyberattack
proliferation to other governments that have the money but not the people to create their own
weapons. In short, it adds another significant element to the cybersecurity threat landscape.
There is a third and final sobering development worth noting from what has obviously
been a challenging year. This comes from the intersection between cyberattacks and
COVID-19 itself.
One might have hoped that a pandemic that cut short millions of lives might at least have
received a pass from the world’s cyberattacks. But that was not the case. After a brief lull in
March, cyberattackers took aim at hospitals and public health authorities, from local
governments to the World Health Organization (WHO). As humanity raced to develop
vaccines, Microsoft security teams detected three nation-state actors targeting seven
prominent companies directly involved in researching vaccines and treatments for Covid-19.
A crisis always seems to bring out the best and worst in people, so perhaps we should not
be surprised that this global crisis was no exception.
Put together, however, these three trends point to a cybersecurity landscape that is even
more daunting than when the year began. The most determined nation-state attackers are
becoming more sophisticated. Risks are both growing and spreading to other governments
through new private sector companies that aid and abet nation state attackers. And nothing,
not even a pandemic, is off limits to these attackers.
We live in a more dangerous world, and it requires a stronger and more coordinated
response.
A more effective strategy as we enter a new year
Put simply, we need a more effective national and global strategy to protect against
cyberattacks. It will need multiple parts, but perhaps most important, it must start with the
recognition that governments and the tech sector will need to act together.
The new year creates an opportunity to turn a page on recent American unilateralism and
focus on the collective action that is indispensable to cybersecurity protection. The United
States did not win World War II, the Cold War or even its own independence by fighting
alone. In a world where authoritarian countries are launching cyberattacks against the
world’s democracies, it is more important than ever for democratic governments to work
together – sharing information and best practices, and coordinating not just on cybersecurity
protection but on defensive measures and responses.

Unlike attacks from the past, cybersecurity threats also require a unique level of collaboration
between the public and private sectors. Today’s technology infrastructure, from data centers
to fiberoptic cables, is most often owned and operated by private companies. These
represent not only much of the infrastructure that needs to be secured but the surface area
where new cyberattacks typically are first spotted. For this reason, effective cyber-defense
requires not just a coalition of the world’s democracies, but a coalition with leading tech
companies.
To be successful, this coalition will need to do three things more effectively in the future:
First, we need to take a major step forward in the sharing and analysis of threat
intelligence. In a new year that will mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11, we should remember
one of the lessons from the tragic day that the 9/11 Commission called “a shock but not a
surprise.” A recurring theme of the commission’s findings was the inability across
government agencies to build collective knowledge by connecting data points together. The
commission therefore focused its first recommendation on “unifying strategic intelligence”
and moving from the “need to know” to the “need to share.”
If there is an initial question for the incoming Biden-Harris Administration and America’s
allies, it is this: Is the sharing of cybersecurity threat intelligence today better or worse than it
was for terrorist threats before 9/11?
In the wake of this most recent attack, perhaps no company has done more work than
Microsoft to support agencies across the federal government. As much as we appreciate the
commitment and professionalism of so many dedicated public servants, it is apparent to us
that the current state of information-sharing across the government is far from where it needs
to be. It too often seems that federal agencies currently fail to act in a coordinated way or in
accordance with a clearly defined national cybersecurity strategy. While parts of the federal
government have been quick to seek input, information sharing with first responders in a
position to act has been limited. During a cyber incident of national significance, we need to
do more to prioritize the information-sharing and collaboration needed for swift and effective
action. In many respects, we risk as a nation losing sight of some of the most important
lessons identified by the 9/11 Commission.
One indicator of the current situation is reflected in the federal government’s insistence on
restricting through its contracts our ability to let even one part of the federal government
know what other part has been attacked. Instead of encouraging a “need to share,” this turns
information sharing into a breach of contract. It literally has turned the 9/11 Commission’s
recommendations upside down.
It will be critical for the incoming Biden-Harris Administration to move quickly and decisively
to address this situation. One ready-made opportunity is to establish a national cybersecurity
director as recommended by the Solarium Commission and provided for in the National
Defense Authorization Act.

Effective progress will also require a second realization that goes beyond anything the 9/11
Commission needed to confront. Cybersecurity threat intelligence exists in even more
disconnected silos than more traditional information about national security threats. This is
because it is spread not only among different agencies and governments but across multiple
private sector companies as well. Even within a large company like Microsoft, we have
learned that it is critical for our Threat Intelligence Center to aggregate and analyze data
from across our data centers and services. And when there is a major threat, we need to
share information and collective assessments with other tech companies.
Recent years have brought several important steps to better share cybersecurity information,
and we greatly appreciate the dedication and support of many key people across the U.S.
government. But we still lack a formal and cohesive national strategy for the sharing of
cybersecurity threat intelligence between the public and private sectors. While there need to
be important safeguards to protect government secrets and private citizens’ privacy, the time
has come for a more systemic and innovative approach to the sharing and analysis of threat
intelligence with those best positioned to act.
Second, we need to strengthen international rules to put reckless nation-state
behavior out of bounds and ensure that domestic laws thwart the rise of the
cyberattack ecosystem. While the world has important international norms and laws to
address nation-state attacks, we continue to believe it is important to fill in gaps and continue
to develop clear and binding legal obligations for cyberspace.
This should build on the lessons of 2020 and prioritize key and specific areas. For example,
it should include the continued development of rules to expressly forbid the type of broad and
reckless activity used against SolarWinds and its customers, which tampered with legitimate
software and threatened the stability of a broader software supply chain. The international
community has been moving in this direction, building on a 2015 report by a United Nations
Group of Governmental Experts that received broad UN endorsement last year, as well as
multi-stakeholder support by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC).
The U.S. government and its allies need to make crystal clear their views that this type of
supply chain attack falls outside the bounds of international law.
We need similar strong and effective endorsements of rules that put attacks on health care
institutions and vaccine providers off limits. (The recently convened Oxford Process has
done important work to highlight the protections existing international law affords in this
context.) And international rules should include stronger protections of democratic and
electoral processes, as reflected in the principles of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in
Cyberspace, which now has more than 1,000 signatories – the largest multi-stakeholder
group ever assembled in support of an international cybersecurity-focused agreement.
In addition, governments should take new and concerted steps to thwart the rise of private
sector offensive actors. As described above, these companies in effect have created a new
ecosystem to support offensive nation-state attacks. The sooner governments take action to
7/9

put this ecosystem out of business, the better.
An early opportunity for the Biden-Harris Administration will come in an appellate judicial
case involving the NSO Group itself. NSO has appealed a lower court finding that it is not
immune from claims that it violated the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by accessing
mobile devices without permission. Its argument is that it is immune from U.S. law because it
is acting on behalf of a foreign government customer and hence shares that government’s
legal immunity. NSO’s proposed recipe would make a bad problem even worse, which is why
Microsoft is joining with other companies in opposing this interpretation. The Biden/Harris
Administration should weigh in with a similar view.
NSO’s legal approach, while disconcerting, does the world a service by highlighting the path
needed to thwart this new cyberattack ecosystem. It’s to ensure that domestic laws clearly
and strongly prohibit companies from helping governments engage in unlawful and offensive
cyberattacks and investors from knowingly financing them.
Consider the analogy to other forms of societally harmful activity, like human trafficking,
narcotics or terrorism itself. Governments not only take strong steps to prohibit the illegal
activity itself – such as engaging in drug trafficking – but also ensure that airlines don’t
transport the drugs and investors don’t finance the activity.
A similar approach is needed to deter private sector offensive actors. We need steps to
ensure, for example, that American and other investors don’t knowingly fuel the growth of
this type of illegal activity. And the United States should proactively pursue discussions with
other countries that are giving rise to these companies, including Israel, which has a strong
cybersecurity ecosystem that can be drawn into dangerous support of authoritarian regimes.
Finally, we need stronger steps to hold nation-states accountable for cyberattacks.
Governments and private companies have taken stronger steps in recent years to hold
nation-states publicly accountable for cyberattacks. We need to build on this course and
continue to press forward with it, with governments ensuring that there are greater real-world
consequences for these attacks to promote stability and discourage conflict.
The world’s democracies took important steps in 2017 and 2018, led by the United States.
With public statements about WannaCry and NotPetya, multiple governments attributed
these attacks publicly to the North Korean and Russian governments, respectively. These
types of coordinated public attributions have become an important tool to respond to nationstate attacks. The United States followed with stronger deterrent steps to protect the 2018
mid-term elections, and an even more concerted effort to successfully deter foreign
tampering with voting in the 2020 Presidential elections.
In the private sector, circumstances have also changed dramatically since the early days in
2016 when we at Microsoft took legal action to thwart Russian cyberattacks on American
political campaigns but were reluctant to speak publicly about it. In the years since,

8/9

companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Twitter have all acted and spoken
directly and publicly when responding to nation-state cyberattacks. Moreover, a coalition of
more than 145 global technology companies have signed on to the Cybersecurity Tech
Accord – committing themselves to upholding four principles of responsible behavior to
promote peace and security online, including opposing cyberattacks against innocent
civilians and enterprises.
The coming months will present a critical test, not only for the United States but for other
leading democracies and technology companies. The weeks ahead will provide mounting
and we believe indisputable evidence about the source of these recent attacks. It will
become even clearer that they reflect not just the latest technology applied to traditional
espionage, but a reckless and broad endangerment of the digital supply chain and our most
important economic, civic and political institutions. It is the type of international assault that
requires the type of collective response that shows that serious violations have
consequences.
If there is a common lesson from the past few years, it’s the importance of combining
ongoing learning with new innovations, greater collaboration, and constant courage. For four
centuries, the people of the world have relied on governments to protect them from foreign
threats. But digital technology has created a world where governments cannot take effective
action alone. The defense of democracy requires that governments and technology
companies work together in new and important ways – to share information, strengthen
defenses and respond to attacks. As we put 2020 behind us, the new year provides a new
opportunity to move forward on all these fronts.

Following news reports about the impact on Microsoft of the SolarWinds issue, the company
issued the following statement:
“Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor
and can confirm that we detected malicious SolarWinds binaries in our environment, which
we isolated and removed. We have not found evidence of access to production services or
customer data. Our investigations, which are ongoing, have found absolutely no indications
that our systems were used to attack others.”
