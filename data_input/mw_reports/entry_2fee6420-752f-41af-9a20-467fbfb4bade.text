NASA and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have also been compromised by
the nation-state hackers behind the SolarWinds supply-chain attack, according to
a Washington Post report.
The two attacks are part of a broader espionage effort targeting and compromising multiple
US government agencies over the last year.
NASA (short for National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is an independent U.S.
federal agency coordinating its civilian space program. The FAA is the US civil aviation and
international waters regulator.

While the US government has not publicly disclosed that NASA and the FAA were breached,
the agencies' identities were confirmed by the Post with US officials after Anne Neuberger,
White House’s deputy national security adviser, said that nine federal agencies were
breached in the SolarWinds hack campaign.
A Transportation Department spokesperson said the agency is investigating the situation. A
NASA spokeswoman added that the federal agency is working with CISA on "mitigation
efforts to secure NASA’s data and network."
These two federal agencies are the last two to be identified after the hacks of seven others
have already been acknowledged since the espionage campaign was uncovered.
The threat actor behind these attacks is currently tracked as StellarParticle (CrowdStrike),
UNC2452 (FireEye), SolarStorm (Palo Alto Unit 42), and Dark Halo (Volexity).
While its identity is still anonymous, the FBI, CISA, ODNI, and the NSA issued a joint
statement saying that it is likely a Russian-backed hacking group.
Microsoft shared a detailed timeline of the attacks& showing that the state hackers trojanized
the company's Orion IT monitoring platform in February 2020 and later deployed a backdoor
using the software's update mechanism on compromised networks in late-March.

Compromised federal agencies
The list of the seven other US government agencies confirmed as having been hit in the
SolarWinds supply-chain attack includes:
US& Department of the Treasury
US& National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
US& Department of State
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) (part of the US Department of Health)
US& Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
US& Department of Energy (DOE)
US& National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)
In January, the Administrative Office of the US Courts disclosed an ongoing
investigation following a potential compromise of the federal courts' case management and
electronic case files system.
Last week, Microsoft also revealed that the SolarWinds hackers accessed and downloaded
source code for a limited number of Azure, Intune, and Exchange components.
According to the Post's report, the Biden administration is also& planning to sanction Russia
for the SolarWinds hacks and poisoning& opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
