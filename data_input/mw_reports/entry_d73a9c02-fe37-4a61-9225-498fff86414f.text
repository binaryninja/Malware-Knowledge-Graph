As ransomware campaigns continue, malicious actors introduce different modus operandi
to target their victims. In this blog, we’ll be taking a look at the Clop ransomware. This
crimeware was discovered in 2019 and is said to be used for an attack that demanded one
of the highest ransom amounts in recorded history ($20 million).
Their strategy is to send the malicious payloads via different methods, such as phishing
emails, and spreading ransomware payload post-exploitation by exploiting exposed or
related vulnerable systems. Actors behind this crimeware then present instructions on how
to pay ransom and communicate further threats of exposure by publishing the sensitive
information they obtained on a publicly accessible website.
Although this may appear as a new modality, in reality ransomware is usually the cherry on
top of the cake, as malicious actors usually dwell, exfiltrate and qualify exfiltrated data,
which eventually lands on dark web public forums, dark markets or private crime
intelligence brokers where qualified financial, business and kompromat information is then
priced and sold to the highest bidder.

The above is a simple example of how compromised information is brokered in dark
markets. Some private crime intelligence brokers actually present specific company names
and verticals. All this information comes from malicious campaigns; victims realize they
have been compromised when they observe ransomware in their systems.

In the case of Clop ransomware, the perpetrators threaten to publish stolen information in a
publicly accessible site via an onion router (Tor), as seen in the screen capture below.

The Attack
The actors behind Clop ransomware are financially motivated and clearly target several
industry verticals. Ransomware is by nature a post-exploitation tool, so before deploying it
they must infiltrate the victim's infrastructure. At the Splunk Threat Research team we
decided to try this payload on our Splunk Attack Range Local, and this is what we found.
We first started by creating a local environment with a Windows Domain Controller.

We then simply executed the sample:
d0cde86d47219e9c56b717f55dcdb01b0566344c13aa671613598cab427345b9.

Files were encrypted pretty quickly and added the .Clop extension. We can also observe
the appearance of the ransomware note (ClopReadMe.txt).

The above screenshots show how quickly data is encrypted, and the victim is clearly
warned not to attempt to decrypt. They are also threatened with all file deletion after a
period of two weeks.

Reverse Engineering Breakdown
Sandbox Evasion
The Clop binary performs several checks, including running command arguments like
“runrun” to enumerate and encrypt the network.

Defense Evasion
This ransomware has a defense evasion feature where it tries to delete all the logs in the
infected machine to avoid detection.

5/16

Encryption
This ransomware uses the AES and rc4 algorithm to encrypt the file.

Infection
The binary makes sure only one instance of its code runs on the machine it creates a
mutex. If the mutex already exists it will exit the process.

Kill Switch
Some variants of this malware contain a kill switch. The binary checks the keyboard layout
of the infected machine and its locale identifier (language). In our sample analysis we found
that it tries to skip infection or delete itself if the locale identifier or the keyboard layout is
Georgian, Uzbek, Azeri, Kazakhstani or Kyrgyzstani.

Kill Switch Function

Encrypting Network Objects
The following thread is responsible for encrypting files within the network shares by using
the following API of mpr.dll as seen below:
WNetOpenEnumW
WNetEnumResourceW

WNetCloseEnum

Encrypting Drives By Type
The payload can encrypt files on three drive types (FIXED_DRIVE, REMOVABLE_DRIVE
and REMOTE_DRIVE). This function allows the execution of encryption on pretty much any
attached or mapped drives, including both local and attached, like a USB hard drive, for
example, or remote drives usually mapped for backups and centralized data.

8/16

Deleting and Resizing Shadow Storage
Many ransomware variants target the Volume Shadow Copy Service, which is a feature of
Windows that allows the operator to restore data from backup. The expected behavior is the
deletion of the shadow copy storage. In this variant we found that it first deletes the files and
then it resizes them in order to prevent the generation of shadow volume copies, which
effectively impairs this service’s capabilities.

Encrypted. rsrc Section (Ransomware Notes and Resizing Shadow Storage)
The .rsrc section is the common place where the encrypted ransomware notes and some
scripts are located. This figure shows how it enumerates or looks for the right resource data
to decrypt the ransomware note and save it as ClopReadMe.txt.

The Splunk Threat Research Team has developed a new Analytic Story to detect a Clop
ransomware threat; it consists of new and former detections, and you can use the following
detection searches.

Defense
We can pursue further defensive actions by using the Splunk Phantom playbook Detect,
Contain, and Remediate Ransomware, as shown in the following graphic.

This playbook is composed of the following steps:
Get file: Downloads the file sample from a repository.
Detonate file: Submits the file sample for sandbox analysis.
Block IP: Configures your infrastructure to block access to IP addresses associated
with the ransomware.
Block hash: Configures your infrastructure to block access to files matching the hash
of a malicious sample.
Hunt file: Looks for indications of other infected devices in your environment.
14/16

Terminate process: Terminates any instances of the malware actively executing.
Quarantine device: Place the infected devices in quarantine to prevent it from
infecting other devices.
List connections: Examine a device’s active connections/add newly discovered
malicious IPs to the block ip action.
Disable user: Disable the user’s account to prevent further malware propagation.

About the Splunk Threat Research Team
The Splunk Threat Research team is devoted to understanding actor behavior and
researching known threats to build detections that the entire Splunk community can benefit
from. The Splunk Threat Research team does this by building and open-sourcing tools that
analyze threats and actors like the Splunk Attack Range and using these tools to create
attack data sets. From these data sets, new detections are built and shared with the Splunk
community under Splunk Security Content. These detections are then consumed by various
Splunk products like Enterprise Security, Splunk Security Essentials and Mission Control to
help customers quickly and effectively find known threats.
