1. Overview
From 30 September to 4 October, Infoblox observed a malicious email campaign distributing
the remote access trojan (RAT) Dark Crystal, which is also known as dcRAT. This malware is
propagated via a Microsoft Word document that contains a malicious VBA script.
A May 2020 report1 said that dcRAT was being sold on hxxp://dcrat[.]ru. Since then, the site
has been taken down, the content of the landing page has been replaced with Russian
profanities, and distribution of dcRAT has shifted to hacking forums and P2P platforms.

2. Customer impact
Cybercriminals use dcRAT for various purposes, such as to:
Browse the internet by using victims’ machines
Collect clipboard data
Collect cookies

Compile and execute C# code
Execute remote commands
Exfiltrate files
Initialize UDP/TCP flood attacks
Log keystrokes
Manage file systems
Manage running processes
Turn on webcams and microphones on victims’ machines
These and other capabilities allow dcRAT to steal information and use a victim’s machine for
subsequent attacks.

3. Campaign analysis
The email’s subject is Don’t Miss Your Luck or Hi Friend, the attachment is called
MoneyMake.doc, and the sender’s alias is James Leclar, Paul Maccartney, Money Center,
Money Development, Martin Garix, or ADS center. To lure the victims into confirming their
email addresses and opening the attachment, the actors use the following text in the email:
Please confirm your email address link below. Online training, the purpose of which is to
acquaint students with the technology of remote earnings on TUZIR Internet advertising. This
system has proven to be highly effective and is used by many newbies and experienced
directors to earn remotely without leaving their main place of work. The author of the
technology of earning money from advertising and the speaker of the program is Evgeny
Andrianov. All info in Attachment — The Advertising Company.

4. Attack chain
Opening the Word attachment executes the password-protected VBA script, which starts a
series of downloads and displays the message Running Document. Please Wait. The script
also contacts a URL, from where it executes a PowerShell script to download a JavaScript
file, loader.js, which downloads a malicious JavaScript-encoded file, KEiZizen[.]jse, and
deletes itself. KEiZizen[.]jse then downloads the malicious screensaver file found[.]scr, which
downloads savesrefruntimeCrtCommonMonitordhcp.exe. This executable attempts to
determine whether it is working on a virtual machine, creates or modifies registry values,
creates processes, connects to the C&C server, and performs other tasks.
Next, dcRAT opens a URL in Google Chrome to create a remote WMI connection, which the
actors use to connect to the victim’s machine. dcRAT also downloads malicious cookies and
tries to use them to authenticate itself with the victim’s Google account.

5. Vulnerabilities and mitigation
Infoblox recommends the following measures for reducing the risk of infection by dcRAT:
Keep antivirus signatures and engines up to date.
Turn on automatic updates. This will keep the operating system up to date with the
latest security patches.
Do not expose email addresses to the internet.
Exercise caution when opening all email attachments, especially those that come from
unfamiliar senders.
Avoid opening emails with generic subject lines.
