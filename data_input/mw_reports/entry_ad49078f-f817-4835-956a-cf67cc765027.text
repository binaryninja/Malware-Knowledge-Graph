A leaked tool used by the Babuk Locker operation to create custom ransomware
executables is now being used by another threat actor in a very active campaign targeting
victims worldwide.
Babuk Locker was a ransomware operation that launched at the beginning of 2021 when it
began targeting corporate victims and stealing their data in double-extortion attacks.
After performing an attack on Washinton DC's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and
feeling the pressure from law enforcement, the ransomware gang shut down in April
and switched to a non-encrypting data extortion model under the name PayLoad Bin.

Last week, security researcher Kevin Beaumont discovered that someone uploaded the
Babuk operation's ransomware builder to VirusTotal.
When BleepingComputer tested the builder, it was simplistic to generate a customized
ransomware.
All a threat actor has to do is modify the enclosed ransom note to include their own contact
info, and then run the build executable to create customized ransomware encryptors and
decryptors that target Windows, VMware ESXi, Network Attached Storage (NAS) x86, and
NAS ARM devices.

Soon after the builder was leaked online, a threat actor began using it to launch a very
active ransomware campaign.
Starting on Tuesday, a victim reported on Reddit that they were hit by ransomware calling
itself 'Babuk Locker.'

Security researcher MalwareHunterTeam also told BleepingComputer that ID Ransomware
received a sharp spike in Babuk Locker submissions starting on June 29th. These victims
are from all over the world, and the submitted ransom notes all contained the email address
of the threat actor.

Like the original operation, this ransomware attack adds the .babyk extension to encrypted
file names and drops a ransom note named How To Restore Your Files.txt.

Compared to the original Babuk Ransomware operation that demanded hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of dollars to recover their files, this new threat actor is only asking
for .006 bitcoins or approximately $210 from their victims.

The new threat actors also misspelled Babuk by adding a 'C' to 'Babuck Locker' in the
ransom note.
Another noticeable change is that the original Babuk Locker operation utilized a dedicated
Tor payment site used to negotiate with victims. However, the new attacks are using email
to communicate with victims through a babukransom@tutanota.com email address.
It is unclear how the ransomware is being distributed, but we have created a
dedicated Babuck Locker support topic that victims can use to share more information
about the attack.
If anyone pays the ransom demand for this new ransomware campaign, please let us know
as we would like to ask you some private questions.

<p>Hi, I&#39;m Brazilian and I speak Portuguese but I&#39;m translating the
message so that it&#39;s easier to understand my computer was recently infected by
Babuck Locker ransomware, and I am currently looking for a solution as all my files
are inaccessible, I was infected on June 27, 2021. I believe the virus has infected my
PC through crack for an antivirus. now every folder on my device has a note saying
&quot;How To Restore Your Files&quot;, I don&#39;t know what to do. if you need
sample files i am willing to help fight this virus. Thank you very much in advance</p>
