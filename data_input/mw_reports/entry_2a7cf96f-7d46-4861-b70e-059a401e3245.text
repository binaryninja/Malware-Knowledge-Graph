ESET researchers have observed a significant change in the campaign of the infamous espionage group
Turla is a notorious espionage group, and has been active for at least ten years. It came to light in 2008, when Turla breached the US
Department of Defense [1]. Since then, there have been numerous security incidents involving Turla targeting several governments and
sensitive businesses such as the defense industry [2].
Our January 2018 white paper [3] was the first public analysis of a Turla campaign called Mosquito. We have also published indicators of
compromise [4]. Since then, the campaign has remained very active and attackers have been busy changing their tactics to remain as
stealthy as possible.
Starting in March 2018, we observed a significant change in the campaign: it now leverages the open source exploitation framework
Metasploit before dropping the custom Mosquito backdoor. It is not the first time Turla has used generic tools. In the past, we have seen the
group using open-source password dumpers such as Mimikatz. However, to our knowledge, this is the first time Turla has used Metasploit as
a first stage backdoor, instead of relying on one of its own tools such as Skipper [5].

Distribution
As described in our earlier analysis [3], the typical vector of compromise of the Mosquito campaign is still a fake Flash installer, in reality
installing both the Turla backdoor and the legitimate Adobe Flash Player. The typical targets are still embassies and consulates in Eastern
Europe.
We showed that the compromise happens when the user downloads a Flash installer from get.adobe.com through HTTP. Traffic was
intercepted on a node between the end machine and the Adobe servers, allowing Turla’s operators to replace the legitimate Flash executable
with a trojanized version. The following image shows the different points where the traffic could, in theory, be intercepted. Please note that we
believe the fifth possibility to be excluded, as, to the best of our knowledge, Adobe/Akamai was not compromised.

Even though we were not able to spot traffic interception subsequently, we found a new executable that is still impersonating the Flash
installer and is named flashplayer28_xa_install.exe. Thus, we believe the same method of initial compromise is still being used.

Analysis
At the beginning of March 2018, as part of our regular tracking of Turla’s activities, we observed some changes in the Mosquito campaign.
Even though they did not make use of groundbreaking techniques, this is a significant shift in Turla’s Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
(TTPs).
Previously, the chain of compromise was a fake Flash installer dropping a loader and the main backdoor. The following figure summarizes the
process.

Recently, we observed a change in the way in which the final backdoor is dropped. Turla’s campaign still relies on a fake Flash installer but,
instead of directly dropping the two malicious DLLs, it executes a Metasploit shellcode and drops, or downloads from Google Drive, a
legitimate Flash installer. Then, the shellcode downloads a Meterpreter, which is a typical Metasploit payload [6], allowing the attacker to
control the compromised machine. Finally, the machine may receive the typical Mosquito backdoor. The figure below summarizes the new
process.

Because Metasploit is being used, we might also guess that an operator controls the exploitation process manually. The time frame of the
attack was relatively short as the final backdoor was dropped within thirty minutes of the start of the compromise attempt.
The shellcode is a typical Metasploit shellcode, protected using the shikata_ga_nai encoder [7] with seven iterations. The following
screenshots show the encoded and the decoded payload.

Once the shellcode is decoded, it contacts its C&C at https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ, which directs the download of an additional shellcode.
Based on our telemetry, we identified the next stage to be a Meterpreter. That IP address is already known as a previously-seen Mosquito
C&C domain, psychology-blog.ezua[.]com, was resolving to it in October 2017.
Finally, the fake Flash installer downloads a legitimate Adobe installer, from a Google Drive URL, and executes it to lull the user into thinking
all went correctly.

Additional tools
In addition to the new fake Flash installer and Meterpreter, we observed the use of several other tools.
A custom executable that only contains the Metasploit shellcode. This is used to maintain access to a Meterpreter session. It is saved to
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\msupdateconf.exe, granting the executable
persistence.
Another custom executable used to execute PowerShell scripts.
The Mosquito JScript backdoor that uses Google Apps Script as its C&C server.
Privilege escalation using the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll [8].

Conclusion
In this post, we have presented the evolutions of the Turla Mosquito campaign over the last few months. The major change we observed was
the use of Metasploit, an open-source penetration testing project, as a first stage for the custom Mosquito backdoor. This might be useful
information for defenders performing incident response on attacks involving Turla.
