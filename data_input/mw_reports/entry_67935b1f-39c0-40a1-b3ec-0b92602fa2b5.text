RAT Gone Rogue: Meet ARS VBS Loader

Malicious VBScript has long been a fixture of spam and phishing campaigns, but until
recently its functionality has been limited to downloading malware from an attacker-controlled
server and executing it on a compromised computer.
Malicious VBScript has long been a fixture of spam and phishing campaigns, but until
recently its functionality has been limited to downloading malware from an attacker-controlled
server and executing it on a compromised computer.
Researchers at Flashpoint have seen and analyzed a unique departure from this norm in
ARS VBS Loader, a spin-off of a popular downloader called SafeLoader VBS that was sold
and eventually leaked in 2015 on Russian crimeware forums.
ARS VBS Loader not only downloads and executes malicious code, but also includes a
command and control application written in PHP that allows a botmaster to issue commands
to a victim’s machine. This behavior likens ARS VBS Loader to a remote access Trojan
(RAT), giving it behavior and capabilities rarely seen in malicious “loaders”, i.e. initial
infection vector malware families used to install subsequent payloads.

The new loader has been spammed out in email attachments enticing victims with lures in
subject lines related to personal banking, package shipments, and toll road notifications.
Should a victim interact with the attachment and launch it, analysts say numerous types of
commodity malware could be installed, including the AZORult information-stealing malware.
AZORult was also used in campaigns targeting more than 1,000 Magento admin panels; in
those attacks, the malware was used to scrape payment card information from sites running
the popular free and open source ecommerce platform.
ARS VBS Loader targets only Windows machines and supports Windows 10, according to
posts to a Russian-speaking forum going back to December. Previously, another loader
called FUD ASPC Loader, first advertised in May 2017, contained similar functionality but not
Windows 10 support.
The loader is also likely to side-step detection by signature-based antivirus and intrusion
detection systems because of the relative ease in which attackers can obfuscate VBScript,
Flashpoint analysts said. Obfuscation through a variety of means allows attackers to hide
malware; if the malware is obfuscated with encryption or packing, it’s exponentially more
difficult for antivirus to sniff out malicious code, for example.
Once the ARS VBS Loader executes on a victim’s computer, it immediately creates a
number of entries in nearly a dozen autorun locations, including registry, scheduled tasks,
and the startup folder, ensuring persistence through reboots. ARS VBS Loader will connect
to the attacker’s server, sending it system information such as the operating system version
name, computer user name, RAM, processor and graphics card information, a randomly
generated ID for infection tracking, and machine architecture information.

The botmaster, meanwhile, can remotely administer commands to bots through the PHP
command-and-control application. Communication with the command-and-control server is
carried out in plaintext over HTTP, making it easy to spot, Flashpoint analysts said.
The malicious code that runs on the victim’s machine is written entirely in VBScript and
contains functionality for updating and deleting itself, and deploying plugins such as a
credentials stealer, or launching application-layer denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against
websites, and loading additional malware from external websites.
The most common command spotted by analysts is download, which instructs bots to
download and execute malware from a supplied URL. There is also the plugin command
where plugins that steal passwords or capture desktop screenshots can be pushed to

compromised computers.
The DDoS command is also noteworthy because it’s a unique capability; analysts said they
have not seen this command used in the wild. The command tells bots to send a specified
amount of HTTP POST requests to a particular URL. Since this is a simple application layer
flooding attack, it is currently unknown how successful this attack would be against targets in
the wild, analysts said, adding that it would be easy to spot such traffic because the same
hardcoded POST values are sent in the HTTP flood.

Analysts caution that users should be vigilant about not opening email attachments from
unknown sources, and that it’s likely ARS VBS Loader will continue to be an effective initial
infection vector for spam campaigns.
