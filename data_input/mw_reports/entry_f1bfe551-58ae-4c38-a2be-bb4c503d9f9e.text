Executive Summary
The Trust Problem
The exploitation of trust is a common mode of operation for online attackers and other
malicious actors. They take advantage of users’ trust in systems, applications, and the people
and businesses they interact with on a regular basis. And this approach works: There is
ample evidence that adversaries are coming up with new methods for embedding their
malware in networks, remaining undetected for long periods, and stealing data or disrupting
critical systems.
Using methods ranging from the socially engineered theft of passwords and credentials to
stealthy, hide-in-plain-sight infiltrations that execute in minutes, malicious actors continue to
exploit public trust to effect harmful consequences. However, the trust problem goes beyond
criminals exploiting vulnerabilities or preying on users through social engineering: it undermines
confidence in both public and private organizations.
Today’s networks are facing two forms of trust erosion. One is a decline in customer
confidence in the integrity of products. The other is mounting evidence that
malicious actors are defeating trust mechanisms, thus calling into
question the effectiveness of network and application assurance,
authentication, and authorization architectures.
In this report, Cisco offers data on and insights into top
security concerns, such as shifts in malware, trends in
vulnerabilities, and the resurgence of distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS) attacks. The report also looks at campaigns
that target specific organizations, groups, and industries,

and the growing sophistication of those who attempt to steal
sensitive information. The report concludes with recommendations
for examining security models holistically and gaining visibility across the
entire attack continuum—before, during, and after an attack.

Key Discoveries
Below are three key findings from the Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report:

Attacks against infrastructure are targeting significant resources across the Internet.
• Malicious exploits are gaining access to web hosting servers, nameservers, and data centers. This suggests the
forming of überbots that seek high-reputation and resource-rich assets.
• Buffer errors are a leading threat, at 21 percent of the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) threat categories.
• Malware encounters are shifting toward electronics manufacturing and the agriculture and mining industries at about
six times the average encounter rate across industry verticals.

Malicious actors are using trusted applications to exploit gaps in perimeter security.
• Spam continues its downward trend, although the proportion of maliciously intended spam remains constant.
• Java comprises 91 percent of web exploits; 76 percent of companies using Cisco Web Security services are
running Java 6, an end-of-life, unsupported version.
• “Watering hole” attacks are targeting specific industry-related websites to deliver malware.

Investigations of multinational companies show evidence of internal compromise. Suspicious traffic is emanating
from their networks and attempting to connect to questionable sites (100 percent of companies are calling malicious
malware hosts).
• Indicators of compromise suggest network penetrations may be undetected over long periods.
• Threat alerts grew 14 percent year over year; new alerts (not updated alerts) are on the rise.
• Ninety-nine percent of all mobile malware in 2013 targeted Android devices. Android users also have the highest
encounter rate (71 percent) with all forms of web-delivered malware.

Report Content
The Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report presents security insights
across four key areas:
Trust
All organizations should be concerned about finding the right
balance of trust, transparency, and privacy because much is
at stake. In this area, we address three pressures that make
security practitioners’ attempts to help their organizations
achieve this balance even more challenging:

• Greater attack surface area
• Proliferation and sophistication of the attack model
• Complexity of threats and solutions
Threat Intelligence
Using the largest set of detection telemetry available, Cisco
and Sourcefire together have analyzed and assembled
security insights from the past year:

• Attacks against infrastructure are targeting significant
resources across the Internet.

• Malicious actors are using trusted applications to exploit
gaps in perimeter security.

• Indicators of compromise suggest that network

penetrations may be undetected over long periods.

Industry
In this section, Cisco Security Intelligence Operations (SIO)
investigators elevate the discussion around industry trends
that extend beyond Cisco’s telemetry, yet still affect security
practices—from brute-force login attempts, large-scale DDoS
activity, and ransomware efforts to the growing reliance on
the cloud, lack of security talent, and other concerns.

Recommendations
Organizations are facing a greater attack surface, the
growing proliferation and sophistication of attack models,
and increasing complexity within the network. Many are
struggling to solidify a security vision supported by an
effective strategy that uses new technologies, simplifies
their architecture and operations, and strengthens their
security teams.
This section covers how a threat-centric security model
enables defenders to address the full attack continuum,
across all attack vectors, and to respond at any time, all
the time, in a continuous fashion—before, during, and after
an attack.

How Cisco Evaluates the Threat Landscape
Cisco plays a critical role in evaluating threats, given the prevalence of its solutions and
the breadth of its security intelligence:

• 16 billion web requests are inspected every day through Cisco Cloud Web Security
• 93 billion emails are inspected every day by Cisco’s hosted email solution
• 200,000 IP addresses are evaluated daily
• 400,000 malware samples are evaluated daily
• 33 million endpoint files are evaluated every day by FireAMP
• 28 million network connects are evaluated every day by FireAMP
This activity results in the following threats being detected by Cisco:

• 4.5 billion emails are blocked every day
• 80 million web requests are blocked every day
• 6450 endpoint file detections occur every day in FireAMP
• 3186 endpoint network detections occur every day in FireAMP
• 50,000 network intrusions are detected every day

New Ways of Doing Business,
New Security Gaps
Weak links in the technology supply chain are one facet of today’s
complex cyberthreat and risk landscape.
So, too, is the emergence of the any-to-any infrastructure, where any device in any location
may be coming over any instantiation of the network.1 There is also a growing abundance of
Internet-enabled devices—smartphones, tablets, and more—trying to connect to applications
that could be running anywhere, including a public software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud, a
private cloud, or a hybrid cloud.2 Even basic Internet infrastructure services have become a
target for hackers who want to take advantage of the reputation, bandwidth, and continuous
uptime and availability of web hosting servers, nameservers, and data centers to launch
increasingly larger campaigns. (See “Fractures in a Fragile Ecosystem,” page 43.)

[ While trends such as cloud computing and mobility are reducing visibility
and increasing security complexity, organizations must still embrace
them because they’re critical to their competitive advantage
and business success. But security gaps are emerging—and
widening—as security teams try to align traditional solutions
with new and rapidly evolving ways of doing business.
Meanwhile, malicious actors are working faster to exploit
the gaps that nonintegrated point solutions simply cannot
address. And they are succeeding because they have the

resources to be more nimble. ]

The cybercrime network is expanding, strengthening, and,
increasingly, operating like any legitimate, sophisticated business
network. Today’s cybercriminal hierarchy is like a pyramid (see Figure 1). At the bottom are
the nontechnical opportunists and “crimeware-as-a-service” users who want to make money,
a statement, or both with their campaigns. In the middle are the resellers and infrastructure
maintainers—the “middlemen.” At the top are the technical innovators—the major players who
law enforcement seeks most, but struggles to find.

Modern cybercriminals usually have clear business objectives when launching their exploits.
They know what information they’re seeking or what outcomes they want to achieve, and they
know the path they need to take to reach these goals. Adversaries will spend significant time
researching their targets, often through publicly available information on social networks, and
planning their objectives strategically.

[ Many actors in the so-called “shadow economy” also now send surveillance malware to
collect information about an environment, including what security technology is deployed, so
they can target their attacks. This pre-exploit reconnaissance is how some malware writers
can be sure their malware will work. Once embedded in a network, the advanced malware
they design can communicate with command-and-control servers on the outside and spread
laterally across infrastructure to carry out its mission—whether it’s the theft of vital data or the
disruption of critical systems. ]

An Erosion of Trust
Threats designed to take advantage of users’ trust in systems,
applications, and the people and businesses they know are now
permanent fixtures in the cyber world.
Dissect almost any scheme and at the core is some abuse of trust: Malware delivered to
users legitimately browsing mainstream websites. Spam emails that appear to be sent by wellknown companies but contain links to malicious sites. Third-party mobile applications laced
with malware and downloaded from popular online marketplaces. Insiders using information
access privileges to steal intellectual property from employers.
There should be an assumption by all users, perhaps, that nothing in the cyber world can
or should be trusted. And security professionals may do their organizations a service by not
trusting any network traffic3—or by not having full faith in the security
practices of vendors or the supply chains that provide technology
to the enterprise. Yet organizations in the public and private
sectors, individual users, and even nation-states still want
assurance that they can trust the foundational technologies
they rely on every day.
This need for confidence in security has helped to further
the advancement of the Common Criteria for Information
Technology Security Evaluation (Common Criteria), the

language and framework that allows government agencies and
other groups to define the requirements that technology products
must meet to assure they are trustworthy. Today, 26 countries, including the
United States, are participating in the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, a
multilateral agreement that provides for mutual recognition of evaluated products by
participating governments.
However, in 2013, trust, in general, suffered a setback. The catalyst: Edward Snowden.
The former U.S. government contractor leaked classified information to The Guardian, a
U.K. newspaper—information he obtained while working on assignment for the U.S. National
Security Agency (NSA).4

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Trust

Snowden’s disclosures to the media to date include details about the NSA’s electronic
surveillance and data collection program, PRISM,5 as well as a separate NSA-GCHQ6 program
known as MUSCULAR, through which fiber-optic networks carrying traffic from the overseas
data centers of major Internet companies were allegedly tapped.7
These and other revelations by Snowden about government surveillance practices have
eroded trust on many levels: between nation-states, between governments and the private
sector, between private citizens and their governments, and between private citizens and
organizations in the public and private sector. They also have naturally raised concerns about
the presence and potential risks of both unintentional vulnerabilities and intentional “backdoors”
in technology products—and whether vendors are doing enough to prevent these weaknesses
and protect end users.

Primary Security Challenges
for 2014
[ As trust erodes—and it becomes harder to define which systems
and relationships are trustworthy and which are not—organizations
face several key issues that undermine their ability to address
security:
1 | Greater attack surface area
2 | Proliferation and sophistication of the attack model
3 | Complexity of threats and solutions ]

These combined issues create and exacerbate the security gaps that allow malicious actors to
launch exploits faster than organizations can address their security weaknesses.
These threats and risks are examined in more detail on the following pages.

13

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Trust

1 | Greater Attack Surface Area
Today’s attack surface presents endless possibilities for malicious actors to undermine a large
and fragile security ecosystem. The surface has increased exponentially and is still expanding—
so many endpoints, so many inroads, so much data that’s not under enterprise control.
Data is the prize most adversaries want to reach through their campaigns because it is
essentially currency. If data has any “street value”—whether it’s a major corporation’s intellectual
property or an individual’s healthcare data—it is desirable and, therefore, at risk. If the value of
the target is greater than the risk of compromising it, it will be hacked. Even small organizations
are at risk of being hacked. And most organizations, large and small, have already been
compromised and don’t even know it: 100 percent of business networks analyzed by Cisco
have traffic going to websites that host malware.

The anatomy of a modern threat, outlined in Figure 2, underscores how the end goal of many
cybercrime campaigns is to reach the data center and exfiltrate valuable
data. In this example, a malicious action occurs on a device outside
the corporate network. It causes an infection, which moves to a
campus network. That network serves as a launchpad to the
enterprise network, and then the threat makes its way to the
treasure trove: the data center.
In light of the expanding attack surface area and the targeting
of high-value data by hackers, Cisco security experts
recommend that enterprises seek to answer two important

questions in 2014: “Where does our critical data reside?” and
“How can we create a secure environment to protect that data,
especially when new business models like cloud computing and mobility
leave us with little control over it?”

2 | Proliferation and Sophistication of the Attack Model
Today’s threat landscape is nothing like that of just 10 years ago. Simple attacks that caused
containable damage have given way to modern cybercrime operations that are sophisticated,
well-funded, and capable of causing major disruption to organizations.
Companies have become the focus of targeted attacks. These attacks are very difficult to
detect, remain in networks for long periods of time, and amass network resources to launch
attacks elsewhere.
To cover the entire attack continuum, organizations need to address a broad range of attack
vectors with solutions that operate everywhere the threat can manifest itself: on the network,
on endpoints, on mobile devices, and in virtual environments.

3 | Complexity of Threats and Solutions
Gone are the days when spam blockers and antivirus software could help guard an easily
defined network perimeter from most threats. Today’s networks go beyond traditional
boundaries, and constantly evolve and spawn new attack vectors: mobile devices, web-enabled
and mobile applications, hypervisors, social media, web browsers, home computers, and even
vehicles. Point-in-time solutions can’t respond to the myriad technologies and strategies in
use by malicious actors. This makes monitoring and managing information security even more
difficult for security teams.
Organizational vulnerabilities are increasing because enterprises
are working through disaggregated point solutions and multiple
management platforms. The result: a set of disparate
technologies across control points that were never designed
to work together. This increases the potential for the
compromise of customer information, intellectual property,
and other sensitive information, and puts a company’s
reputation at risk.
A continuous capability that provides the best opportunity to meet

the challenges of complex threat environments is needed. Relentless
attacks do not occur at a single point in time; they are ongoing. So, too,
should be a company’s defenses.
With the complexity of threats and corresponding solutions at an all-time high, organizations
need to rethink their security strategy. Instead of relying on point solutions, they can minimize
complexity by continuously integrating security into the fabric of the network itself, so the
network can:

• Continuously monitor and analyze files and identify subsequent malicious
behavior whenever it may begin.

• Help organizations scale enforcement, expanding the surface on which
networking devices can be placed.

• Accelerate the time to detection because it can see more traffic.
• Give organizations the ability to aggregate unique context awareness that
is not possible to obtain by relying on security-specific devices alone.

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Trust

The shift toward mobility and cloud services is placing a greater security burden on endpoints
and mobile devices that in some cases may never even touch the corporate
network. The fact is that mobile devices introduce security risk
when they are used to access company resources; they easily
connect with third-party cloud services and computers with
security postures that are potentially unknown and outside
of the enterprise’s control. In addition, mobile malware is
growing rapidly, which further increases risk. Given the lack
of even basic visibility, most IT security teams don’t have the
capability to identify potential threats from these devices.
Advanced approaches such as continuous capability will play

a greater role in addressing advanced malware through big data
analytics that aggregate data and events across the extended network
to provide greater visibility even after a file has moved into the network or between endpoints.
This differs from point-in-time endpoint security that scans files at an initial point in time to
determine a malware disposition. Advanced malware can evade this scan to establish itself
quickly on endpoints and spread throughout networks.

Trustworthy, Transparent
Systems
In light of the greater attack surface area, growing proliferation and
sophistication of the attack model, and the complexity of threats
and solutions, we need to trust the information we consume,
along with the systems that deliver it, no matter how we access
networked services.
Creating a truly secure network environment becomes even more complex as governments
and businesses invest in mobility, collaboration, cloud computing, and other forms of
virtualization. These capabilities help to improve resiliency, increase efficiency, and reduce
costs, but also can introduce additional risks. The security of the manufacturing processes

creating IT products is also now at risk, with counterfeit and tampered products becoming
a growing problem. As a result, today’s government and corporate leaders overwhelmingly
identify cybersecurity and associated trust issues as top concerns. The question security
practitioners should ask is: What would we do differently if we knew a compromise
were imminent?
Malicious actors will seek out and exploit any security weakness in the technology supply
chain. Vulnerabilities and intentional backdoors in technology products can ultimately provide
them with access to the “full house.” Backdoors have long been a security issue and should
be a concern for organizations, because they exist solely to help facilitate surreptitious or
criminal activity.
Developing trustworthy systems means building in security from the ground up, from the
beginning to the end of a product’s life cycle. The Cisco Secure Development
Life cycle (CSDL)8 prescribes a repeatable and measurable
methodology designed to build in product security at the product
concept stage, minimize vulnerabilities during development, and
increase resiliency of products in the face of an attack.
Trustworthy systems provide the foundation for a continuous
improvement approach to security that anticipates and
preempts new threats. Such infrastructures not only protect
critical information, but more importantly, help to avoid
interruptions of critical services. Trustworthy products supported

by trusted vendors enable their users to minimize the costs and
reputation damage stemming from information misappropriation, service
outages, and information breaches.
Trustworthy systems, however, should not be confused with immunity from an external
attack. IT customers and users have an important role to play in maintaining the effectiveness
of trustworthy systems in fending off attempts to corrupt their operations. This includes
timely installation of security-focused updates and patches, constant vigilance in recognizing
abnormal system behavior, and effective countermeasures against attack.

Top Concerns for 2014
from Today’s CISOs
As chief information security officers
(CISOs) survey today’s threat
landscape, they are faced with
growing pressure to protect terabytes
of data, meet stiff compliance
regulations, and evaluate risks of
working with third-party vendors—and
doing it all with shrinking budgets and
lean IT teams. CISOs have more tasks
than ever and sophisticated, complex
threats to manage. Principal security
strategists for Cisco security services,
who advise CISOs on security
approaches for their organizations,
offer this list of the most pressing
concerns and challenges for 2014:

Trust

Technologies do not stand still, and neither do attackers.
Ensuring system trustworthiness needs to cover the full
life cycle of a network, from initial design to manufacturing,
system integration, daily operation, maintenance and
updates, and ultimately, to decommissioning of the solution.
The need for trustworthy systems extends beyond an
organization’s own network to include those networks with
which an organization connects. Cisco Security Research
and Operations teams have observed increased use
over the past year of “pivoting.” The pivoting technique in
cybercrime involves the use of a backdoor, vulnerability, or
simple exploitation of trust at some point in the attack chain
as a springboard to launch a more sophisticated campaign
against much bigger targets—such as the network of a major
energy firm or a financial institution’s data center. Some
hackers use the trust that exists between organizations as

Managing Compliance

the base for a pivot, exploiting one trusted business partner

The most pervasive concern among
CISOs may be the need to protect
data that resides throughout an
increasingly porous network, while
expending precious resources on
compliance. Compliance alone is not
equal to being secure—it is simply
a minimum baseline focusing on
the needs of a special regulated
environment. Security, meanwhile,
is an all-encompassing approach that
covers all business activities.

or governmental partner.
Vigilance is appropriate in the modern threat landscape.
Security must adapt to all the transient states that are part of
the enterprise IT environment by measurably and objectively
validating system trustworthiness, based on independent
confirmable data and processes. The most sustainable
approach is a dynamic defense tailored to an organization’s
unique environment, which includes security controls that are
evolved constantly so they remain relevant.9
Trustworthy systems can exist in this environment, and
transparency is essential to building them. “A trustworthy
system must be built on a strong foundation: product
development practices, a trustworthy supply chain, and
an architectural approach consisting of network design,
implementation, and policies,” says John N. Stewart,

has become a cost-effective and
agile way to manage ever-growing
storehouses of data, but it raises
more worries for CISOs. Chief
executive officers and boards of
directors see the cloud as a panacea
for eliminating costly hardware. They
want the benefits of offloading data
to the cloud, and expect the CISO to
make it happen—securely and quickly.
Trusting Vendors
As with the cloud, organizations tap
into vendors to provide specialized
solutions. The cost model for going
with third parties makes sense.
However, these vendors are highvalue targets for criminals, who know
that third-party defenses may not be
as strong.
Bouncing Back from Security
Breaches
All organizations should assume
they’ve been hacked, or at least agree
that it’s not a question of if they will
be targeted for an attack, but when.
Recent hacks such as Operation
Night Dragon, the RSA breach, and
the Shamoon attack against a large
oil and gas company in 2012 are
on the minds of many CISOs. (See
Cisco’s research about the prevalence
of malicious activity in corporate
networks on page 48.)

senior vice president and chief security officer at Cisco. “But
the most important attribute is vendor transparency.”
The trade-off for more transparency is less privacy,
but finding the right balance can be achieved through
cooperation—which leads to greater opportunities to
align threat intelligence and security best practices. All
organizations should be concerned about finding the right
balance of trust, transparency, and privacy because much
is at stake.

[ In the long term, better cybersecurity can be achieved for
all users, and the full potential of the emerging Internet of
Everything10 economy can be realized. But meeting these
goals will hinge on effective privacy policies and robust
network defenses that intelligently distribute the burden
of security across the endpoints and the network. In the
short term, and closer to home perhaps, is the need for any
modern business to use the best methods and information
available to help protect its most valuable assets, and
ensure it is not a direct contributor to broader cybersecurity
challenges. ]

Today’s organizations must consider what impact their
security practices may have on the larger and increasingly
complex and interconnected cybersecurity ecosystem. Not
taking this “big picture” view could result in an organization
earning a bad reputation score, which means no leading
security provider will allow users to access their site. Being
blacklisted is not easy for a business to come back from—and
some may never fully recover.

Threat Alerts on the Rise
Vulnerabilities and threats reported by Cisco IntelliShield® showed
steady growth in 2013: as of October 2013, cumulative annual alert
totals increased 14 percent year-over-year from 2012 (Figure 3).
Alerts in October 2013 were at their highest level since IntelliShield began recording them in
May 2000.
Also notable is the significant increase in new alerts as opposed to updated alerts, as tracked
by IntelliShield (Figure 4). Technology vendors and researchers are finding an increasing
number of new vulnerabilities (Figure 5), the discoveries being a result of the greater emphasis
on highly secure development life cycle use, as well as improvements in the security of their
own products. The higher number of new vulnerabilities may also be a sign that vendors are
examining their product code and fixing vulnerabilities before products are released and their
vulnerabilities exploited.

More attention to secure software development can help build trust in vendor solutions.
A secure development life cycle not only mitigates the risk of vulnerabilities and allows vendors
to detect potential defects early in development, but also tells purchasers that they can rely
on these solutions.

Spam Volume Is Down, but
Malicious Spam Is Still a Threat
Spam volume was on a downward trend worldwide in 2013.
However, while the overall volume may have decreased, the
proportion of maliciously intended spam remained constant.
Spammers use speed as a tool to abuse email users’ trust, delivering massive amounts of
spam when news events or trends lower recipients’ resistance to spam scams.
In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013, two large-scale spam
campaigns commenced—one on April 16 and another on April 17—designed to attract email
users hungry for news of the event’s impact. Cisco researchers first
detected the registration of hundreds of bombing-related domain
names just hours after the Boston Marathon attacks occurred.11
Both spam campaigns carried subject lines about supposed
news bulletins relating to the bombings, while the messages
contained links that claimed to lead to videos of the bomb
explosions or news from reputable media sources. The links
directed recipients to webpages that included links to real
news stories or videos—but also malicious iframes designed

to infect the visitors’ computers. At its peak, spam related to
the Boston Marathon bombing made up 40 percent of all spam
messages delivered worldwide on April 17, 2013.
Figure 6 shows one of the botnet’s spam campaigns masquerading as a message from
CNN.12 Figure 7 shows the source HTML for a Boston Marathon bombing spam message.
The final iframe (obfuscated) is for a malicious website.13
Because breaking news spam is so immediate, email users are more likely to believe the spam
messages are legitimate. Spammers prey on people’s desire for more information in the wake
of a major event. When spammers give online users what they want, it’s much easier to trick
them into a desired action, such as clicking an infected link. It’s also much easier to prevent
them from suspecting that something is wrong with the message.

Web Exploits:
Java Leads the Pack
Of all the web-based threats that undermine security,
vulnerabilities in the Java programming language continue to
be the most frequently exploited target by online criminals,
according to Cisco data.
Java exploits far outstrip those detected in Flash or Adobe PDF documents, which are also
popular vectors for criminal activity (Figure 11).
Data from Sourcefire, now part of Cisco, also shows that Java exploits make up the vast
majority (91 percent) of indicators of compromise (IoCs) that are monitored by Sourcefire’s
FireAMP solution for advanced malware analysis and protection (Figure 12). FireAMP
detects live compromises on endpoints, and then records the type of software that
caused each compromise.

For threats such as Java exploits, the most significant issues facing security practitioners are
how malware enters their network environment and where they should focus their efforts to
minimize infection. Individual actions may not appear malicious, but following a chain of events
can shed light on the malware story. Chaining of events is the ability to conduct a retrospective
analysis on data that connects the path taken by malicious actors to bypass perimeter security
and infiltrate the network.
By themselves, IoCs may demonstrate that going to a given website is safe. In turn, the
launch of Java may be a safe action, as may be the launch of an executable file. However, an
organization is at risk if a user visits a website with an iframe injection, which then launches
Java; Java then downloads an executable file, and that file runs malicious actions.

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Threat Intelligence

The ubiquity of Java keeps it high on the list of favored tools for criminals, which makes Java
compromises by far the most malicious “chain of events” activity in 2013. As Java’s “About”
webpage explains, 97 percent of enterprise desktops run Java, as do 89 percent of desktop
computers overall in the United States.14
Java provides an attack surface that is too big for criminals to ignore. They tend to build
solutions that run exploits in order—for instance, they first attempt to breach a network or
steal data using the easiest or best-known vulnerability before moving on to other methods.
In most cases, Java is the exploit that criminals choose first, since it delivers the best return
on investment.

Mitigating the Java Problem
Although Java-based exploits are commonplace, and vulnerabilities are difficult to eliminate,
there are methods for reducing their impact:

• Where practical, disabling Java in browsers network-wide can prevent these exploits
from being launched.

• Telemetry tools like Cisco NetFlow, built in to many security solutions, can monitor

Java-associated traffic, giving security professionals a better understanding of the
sources of threats.

• Comprehensive patch management can close many security holes.
• Endpoint monitoring and analysis tools that continue to track and analyze files after they enter
the network can retrospectively detect and stop threats that pass through as safe but later
exhibit malicious behavior.

• A prioritized list of potentially compromised devices can be generated by using IoCs to

correlate malware intelligence (even seemingly benign events) and to identify a zero-day
infection without existing antivirus signatures.

Upgrading to the latest version of Java will also help sidestep vulnerabilities. According to
research from Cisco TRAC/SIO, 90 percent of Cisco customers use a version of the Java 7
Runtime Environment, the most current version of the program. This is good from a security
standpoint, since this version is likely to offer greater protection against vulnerabilities.

31

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Threat Intelligence

However, Cisco TRAC/SIO research also shows that 76 percent of enterprises using Cisco
solutions are also using the Java 6 Runtime Environment, in addition to Java 7. Java 6 is a
previous version that has reached its end of life and is no longer supported. Enterprises often
use both versions of the Java Runtime Environment because different applications may rely
on different versions to execute Java code. However, with more than three-fourths of the
enterprises surveyed by Cisco using an end-of-life solution with vulnerabilities that may never
be patched publicly, criminals have ample opportunity to exploit weaknesses.
In 2013, Java web malware encounters peaked in April, at 14 percent of all web malware
encountered. These encounters dropped to their lowest point in May and June 2013, at
approximately 6 percent and 5 percent of all web malware encounters, respectively (Figure 13).
(Earlier this year, Oracle announced that it would no longer post Java SE 6 updates to its public
download site, although existing Java SE 6 updates will be available in the Java Archive on the
Oracle Technology Network.)
If security professionals who have limited time to fight web exploits decide to focus most of
their attention on Java, they’ll be putting their resources in the right place.

BYOD and Mobility:
Device Maturation Benefitting
Cybercrime
Cybercriminals and their targets share a common challenge: both
are trying to figure out how best to use the bring-your-own-device
(BYOD) and mobility trends for business advantage.
Two things appear to be helping criminals gain an edge. First is the maturation of mobile
platforms. Cisco security experts note that the more smartphones, tablets, and other devices
perform like traditional desktop and laptop computers, the easier it is to design malware
for them.
Second is the growing using of mobile apps. When users download mobile apps, they’re
essentially putting a lightweight client on the endpoint—and downloading code. Another
challenge: Many users download mobile apps regularly without any
thought of security.
Meanwhile, today’s security teams are grappling with the
“any-to-any problem”: how to secure any user, on any device,
located anywhere, accessing any application or resource.15
The BYOD trend only complicates these efforts. It’s difficult
to manage all of these types of equipment, especially with a
limited IT budget. In a BYOD environment, the CISO needs to
be especially certain that the data room is tightly controlled.

Mobility offers new ways for users and data to be compromised.
Cisco researchers have observed actors using wireless channels to
eavesdrop and gain access to data being exchanged through those channels. Mobility also
presents a range of security issues for organizations, including the loss of intellectual property
and other sensitive data if an employee’s device is lost or stolen and not secured.

33

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Threat Intelligence

Instituting a formal program for managing mobile devices to help ensure that any device is
secure before it can access the network is one solution to improve security for the enterprise,
according to Cisco experts. At the very least, a personal identification number (PIN) lock
should be required for user authentication and the security team should be able to turn off or
wipe clean the device remotely if it is lost or stolen.

Mobile Malware Trends: 2013
The following research on mobile malware trends during 2013 was conducted by Cisco
TRAC/SIO and by Sourcefire, now part of Cisco.
Mobile malware that targets specific devices made up just 1.2
percent of all web malware encounters in 2013. Although
not a significant percentage, it is still worth noting because
mobile malware is clearly an emerging—and logical—area of
exploration for malware developers.
According to Cisco TRAC/SIO researchers, when mobile
malware is intended to compromise a device, 99 percent of all
encounters target Android devices. Trojans targeting Java Micro
Edition (J2ME)-capable devices held the second spot in 2013,

with 0.84 percent of all mobile malware encounters.
Not all mobile malware is designed to target specific devices, however. Many encounters
involve phishing, likejacking, or other social engineering ruses, or forcible redirects to websites
other than expected. An analysis of user agents by Cisco TRAC/SIO reveals that Android
users, at 71 percent, have the highest encounter rates with all forms of web-delivered
malware, followed by Apple iPhone users with 14 percent of all web malware encounters
(Figure 14).
Cisco TRAC/SIO researchers also reported evidence of efforts to monetize Android
compromises during 2013, including launches of adware and small and medium-size
enterprise (SME)-related spyware.
At 43.8 percent, Andr/Qdplugin-A was the most frequently encountered mobile malware,
according to Cisco TRAC/SIO research. Typical encounters were through repackaged copies
of legitimate apps distributed through unofficial marketplaces (Figure 15).

Targeted Attacks:
The Challenge of Dislodging
Persistent and Pervasive
“Visitors”
Odds are high that targeted attacks have already infiltrated
your networks.
And when they do lodge themselves inside a network, they tend to stay around, stealthily
stealing data or using network resources to “pivot” and then attack other entities (for more
on pivoting, see page 18). The damage goes beyond the theft of data or business disruption:
trust between partners and customers can evaporate if these attacks aren’t dislodged from
networks in a timely manner.
Targeted attacks threaten intellectual property, customer data, and sensitive government
information. Their creators use sophisticated tools that circumvent an organization’s security
infrastructure. Criminals go to great lengths to make sure these
breaches go undetected, using methods that result in nearly
imperceptible “indicators of compromise” or IoCs. Their
methodical approach to gain entry into networks and carry out
their mission involves an “attack chain”—the chain of events
that leads up to and through the phases of an attack.
Once these targeted attacks find a place in the network to
hide, they efficiently carry out their tasks, and usually conduct
them without being noticed.

Criminals go to

sure breaches go
undetected.

The Attack Chain
To understand today’s array of threats and effectively defend the network, IT security professionals need to think
like attackers. With a deeper understanding of the methodical approach that malicious actors use to execute
their mission, organizations can identify ways to strengthen their defenses. The attack chain, a simplified version
of the “cyber kill chain,” describes the events that lead to and through the phases of an attack.

1. Survey

Obtain a full picture of an environment: network,
endpoint, mobile, and virtual, including the technologies
deployed to secure the environment.

2. Write

Create targeted, context-aware malware.

3. Test

Ensure the malware works as intended, specifically
so it can evade security tools in place.

4. Execute

Navigate through the extended network—being
environmentally aware, evading detection, and
moving laterally until reaching the target.

5. Accomplish the Mission

Gather data, create disruption, or cause destruction.

Research by Cisco TRAC/SIO during 2013 shows multipurpose trojans were the most
frequently encountered web-delivered malware, at 27 percent of the total encounters.
Malicious scripts, such as exploits and iframes, were the second most frequently encountered
category, at 23 percent. Data-theft trojans, such as password stealers and backdoors, made
up 22 percent of total web malware encounters, with downloader and dropper trojans in fourth
place at 17 percent of total encounters (see Figure 21).
The steady decline in unique malware hosts and IP addresses—a 30 percent decline between
January 2013 and September 2013—suggests that malware is being concentrated in fewer
hosts and fewer IP addresses (Figure 22). (Note: An IP address can serve websites for
multiple domains.) As the number of hosts declines—even as malware remains steady—the
value and reputation of these hosts becomes more important, since good hosts help criminals
accomplish their goals.

Watering Holes No Oasis
for Targeted Enterprises
One way malicious actors try to
deliver malware to organizations in
specific industry verticals is through
the use of “watering hole” attacks.
Like big game watching their prey,
cybercriminals looking to target a
particular group (for example, people
who work in the aviation industry) will
monitor which websites that group
frequents, infect one or more of
these sites with malware, and then
sit back and hope at least one user in
the target group visits that site and is
compromised.
A watering hole attack is essentially
a trust exploit because legitimate
websites are employed. It is also a
form of spear phishing. However,
while spear phishing is directed at
select individuals, watering holes
are designed to compromise groups
of people with common interests.
Watering hole attacks are not
discerning about their targets: anyone
who visits an infected site is at risk.
At the end of April, a watering
hole attack was launched from
specific pages hosting nuclearrelated content at the U.S.
Department of Labor website.16
Then, beginning in early May 2013,
Cisco TRAC/SIO researchers
observed another watering hole
attack emanating from several other

Prime Targets:
Industry Verticals
Companies in high-profit verticals, such as
the pharmaceutical and chemical industry
and electronics manufacturing, have
high rates of web malware encounters,
according to Cisco TRAC/SIO research.
The rate goes up or down as the value of a particular
vertical’s goods and services rises or declines.
Cisco TRAC/SIO researchers observed remarkable growth
in malware encounters for the agriculture and mining
industry—formerly a relatively low-risk sector. They attribute
the increase in malware encounters for this industry to
cybercriminals seizing on trends such as decreasing precious
metal resources and weather-related disruptions in the
food supply.
Also continuing to rise are malware encounters in the
electronics industry. Cisco security experts report that
malware targeting this vertical typically is designed to help
actors gain access to intellectual property, which they in turn
use for competitive advantage or sell to the highest bidder.
To determine sector-specific malware encounter rates, Cisco
TRAC/SIO researchers compare the median encounter rate
for all organizations that proxy through Cisco Cloud Web
Security to the median encounter rate for all companies in
a specific sector that proxy through the service. An industry
encounter rate above 100 percent reflects a higher-thannormal risk of web malware encounters, whereas a rate
below 100 percent reflects a lower risk. For example,

oil sector. Similarities, including the
specific crafting of an exploit used
in both attacks, lend credence to the
possibility that the two attacks were
related. Cisco TRAC/SIO’s research
also indicated that many of the sites
used the same web designer and
hosting provider. This could imply
that the initial compromise was due
to phished or stolen credentials from
that provider.17
Protecting users against these attacks
involves keeping machines and web
browsers fully patched to minimize
the number of vulnerabilities that an
attacker can exploit. Ensuring web
traffic is filtered and checked for
malware prior to its delivery to the
user’s browser is also essential.

a company with a 70 percent encounter rate is 30 percent

Fractures in a Fragile
Ecosystem
Cybercriminals are learning that harnessing the power of the
Internet’s infrastructure yields far more benefits than simply gaining
access to individual computers.
The newest twist in malicious exploits is to gain access to web hosting servers, nameservers,
and data centers—with the goal of taking advantage of the tremendous processing power and
bandwidth they provide. Through this approach, exploits can reach many more unsuspecting
computer users and have a far greater impact on the organizations targeted, whether the goal
is to make a political statement, undermine an adversary, or generate revenue.

In essence, this trend in targeting Internet infrastructure means the foundation of the web
itself cannot be trusted. Methods used to ultimately gain root access to hosting servers are
varied and include tactics such as trojans on management workstations that steal server login
credentials, vulnerabilities in third-party management tools used on the servers, and bruteforce login attempts (see page 53). Unknown vulnerabilities in the server software itself may
also provide inroads.
One compromised hosting server can infect thousands of websites and site owners around
the world (Figure 24).
Websites hosted on compromised servers act as both a redirector (the intermediary in
the infection chain) and a malware repository. Instead of many compromised sites loading
malware from only a few malicious domains (a many-to-few relationship), the relationship has
now become many-to-many, hampering takedown efforts.
Domain nameservers are prime targets in this new breed of attack, the exact methods of
which are still under investigation. Indicators are that, in addition to individual websites and
hosting servers, nameservers at certain hosting providers are also being compromised. Cisco
security researchers say this trend toward targeting the Internet’s infrastructure shifts the
threat landscape, because it is giving cybercriminals control over a not-insignificant portion
of the very foundation of the web.

[ “Cybercrime has become so lucrative and heavily commoditized that it needs a powerful
infrastructure to keep it afloat,” says Gavin Reid, director of threat intelligence for Cisco.
“By compromising hosting servers and data centers, attackers gain not only access to large
amounts of bandwidth, but also the benefit of continuous uptime for those resources.” ]

Connecting the Dots: DarkLeech and Linux/CDorked
The DarkLeech attack campaign reported by Cisco in 201318 underscores how the
compromise of hosting servers can serve as a springboard to a larger campaign. It is
estimated that the DarkLeech attacks compromised, in a short time period, at least 20,00019
legitimate websites around the world that use Apache HTTP server software. Sites were
infected with a Secure Shell daemon (SSHD) backdoor that allowed remote attackers to
upload and configure malicious Apache modules. The compromise enabled attackers to
dynamically inject iframes (HTML elements) in real time on hosted websites, which delivered
exploit code and other malicious content by means of the Blackhole exploit kit.
Because the DarkLeech iframe injections occur only at the moment of a site visit, signs of
the infection may not be readily apparent. In addition, to avoid detection of the compromise,
criminals use a sophisticated array of conditional criteria—for instance, injecting the iframe only

if the visitor arrives from a search engine results page, not injecting the iframe if the visitor’s IP
address matches that of the site owner or hosting provider, and injecting the iframe only once
every 24 hours for individual visitors.
The Cisco TRAC/SIO investigation revealed that the DarkLeech compromises spanned the
globe; countries with the largest number of hosting providers naturally experienced the highest
rate of infection.
Cisco SIO/TRAC researchers queried thousands of compromised servers to ascertain the
distribution of affected server software versions.
In April 2013, another malicious backdoor that had infected hundreds of servers running
Apache HTTP server software was detected. Linux/CDorked20 replaced the HTTPD binary
on cPanel-installed versions of Apache. Similar backdoors targeting Nginx and Lighttpd were

also discovered. Just as selective as DarkLeech in its attack methods, CDorked also uses
conditional criteria to dynamically inject iframes on websites hosted on the affected server.
Any visitor browsing an affected website then has malicious content delivered from another
malicious website, where a crimeware toolkit attempts to further compromise the user’s PC.21
A unique feature of Linux/CDorked is that it cycles through website domains in 24 hours,
on average. Few compromised sites are used for longer. Thus, even if a malware domain is
reported, attackers have already moved on. Also with Linux/CDorked,
hosting providers are changed frequently (about every two weeks),
cycling through the compromised hosts to avoid detection.
Compromised nameservers at these same hosting providers
enable malicious actors to move from host to host without
losing control of domains during the transition. Once on a
new host, the attackers begin a cycle of new domains, often
using typosquatting-style22 domain names in an attempt to
appear legitimate to casual observers.

CDorked and
DarkLeech appear
to be part of a
much greater and
far more complex
strategy.

Cisco TRAC/SIO analysis of traffic patterns with CDorked
strongly suggests a connection with DarkLeech. The specially
encoded referrer URL employed by CDorked specifically denotes traffic from
DarkLeech. But that isn’t the most interesting twist about the malware: both CDorked and
DarkLeech appear to be part of a much greater and far more complex strategy.
“The sophistication of these compromises suggests cybercriminals have gained significant
control over thousands of websites and multiple hosting servers, including nameservers
employed by those hosts,” says Gavin Reid, director of threat intelligence for Cisco.
“Combined with the recent spate of brute-force login attacks against individual websites,
we appear to be witnessing a changing tide, where the infrastructure of the web is being
used to form what can only be described as a very large—and very powerful—botnet.
This überbot can be used for sending spam, delivering malware, and launching DDoS
attacks on a scale never before seen.”

Malicious Traffic, Often a Sign
of Targeted Attacks, Detected
in All Corporate Networks
According to a Cisco examination of threat intelligence trends,
malicious traffic is visible on 100 percent of corporate networks.
This means there is evidence that sophisticated criminals or other
players have penetrated these networks and may be operating
undetected over long periods of time.
All organizations should assume they’ve been hacked, or at least agree that it’s not a question
of if they will be targeted for an attack, but when … and for how long.

[ In a recent project reviewing Domain Name Service (DNS) lookups originating from inside
corporate networks, Cisco threat intelligence experts found that in every case, organizations
showed evidence that their networks had been misused or compromised (Figure 27).
For example, 100 percent of the business networks analyzed by Cisco had traffic going to
websites that host malware, while 92 percent show traffic to webpages without content,
which typically host malicious activity. Ninety-six percent of the networks reviewed showed
traffic to hijacked servers. ]

Cisco also detected traffic going to military or government websites within enterprises that
do not normally do business with either, as well as to websites for high-risk geographic
areas, such as countries embargoed from doing business with the United States. Cisco has
observed that such sites may be used because of the generally high reputation enjoyed by
public or government organizations. Traffic to these sites may not be a definitive sign of a
compromise, but for organizations that do not habitually do business with the government or
the military, such traffic could indicate that networks are being compromised so that criminals
can use them to breach government or military websites and networks.

In spite of their best efforts to keep their networks free of malicious threats, all of the
organizations Cisco examined during 2013 showed evidence of suspicious traffic. The traffic
identified through DNS lookups can provide strong IoCs and are worth further investigation
by organizations that want to halt these hard-to-detect threat actors in their networks. It’s a
method to increase visibility of criminal movement that is typically very difficult to locate.

Special Cisco Security Research Feature:

New Twists on Bitsquatting—and New Ways to Halt Attacks
Cybersquatting—the practice of registering domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to a distinctive
mark—has long been a tool of online criminals. Recently, “bitsquatting,” the registration of domain names that are one
binary digit different from the original domain, has become another way to redirect Internet traffic to sites hosting
malware or scams.
Bitsquatting is a form of cybersquatting that targets bit errors in computer memory. A memory error occurs anytime
one or more bits being read from memory have changed in state from what was previously written. These errors
in memory can occur because of many factors, including cosmic rays (high-energy particles that strike Earth as
frequently as 10,000 per square meter per second), a device being used outside its recommended environmental
parameters, manufacturing defects, and even low-yield nuclear explosions.
By changing a single bit, a domain such as “twitter.com” can become the bitsquat domain “twitte2.com.” An attacker
can simply register a bitsquat domain, wait for a memory error to occur, and then intercept Internet traffic.
Security researchers believe bitsquatting attacks are most likely to occur against frequently resolved domain names,
since these domains are most likely to appear in memory when bit errors occur. However, recent Cisco research
predicts that domains previously not considered “popular” enough to attack will actually produce useful amounts
of bitsquat traffic. This is because the amount of memory per device and the number of devices connected to the
Internet are both increasing; according to Cisco estimates, there will be 37 billion “intelligent things” connected to
the Internet by 2020.23
Bitsquatting Attack Vectors
Cisco TRAC/SIO has identified new bitsquatting attack vectors, including:
•	Subdomain delimiter bitsquatting: According to the accepted syntax for domain name labels, the only valid
characters inside a domain name are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the hyphen. However, when checking for bitsquat
domains, limiting the search to these characters neglects an important character that is also valid inside domain
names: the dot. One new bitsquatting technique relies on bit errors that result in a letter “n” (binary 01101110)
becoming a dot “.” (binary 00101110) and vice versa.
•	Subdomain delimiters where “n” flips to “.”: In a variation of the above technique, if a second-level domain name
contains the letter “n” and there are two or more characters after the letter “n,” then this is a potential bitsquat.
For example, “windowsupdate.com” could become“dowsupdate.com.”
•	URL delimiter bitsquats: A popular context for domain names is within a URL. Inside a typical URL, forward-slash
characters such as “/” act as delimiters, separating the scheme from the hostname from the URL path. The forward
slash character (binary 00101111) can, by the flip of one bit, become the letter “o” (binary 01101111), and
vice versa.

Preventing Bitsquatting Attacks: Create a Bitsquat RPZ
The two mitigation techniques that have commonly been in use to prevent bitsquatting have their place in the security
arsenal, but neither method is optimal:
•	Use error-correcting (ECC) memory: The entire base of installed devices would have to
upgrade simultaneously worldwide to make this an effective solution.
•	Register the bitsquat domain so that no third party can register it: This is not always
possible, as many popular bitsquat domains have already been registered. Depending on
the length of the domain name, this also can be costly.
The good news is that these mitigation techniques are not the only ones a security professional can deploy to protect
users from accidentally misdirecting Internet traffic. With sufficient adoption, the new mitigations could eliminate the
bitsquatting problem almost completely.
For example, response policy zones (RPZs) have been a configuration option since BIND version 9.8.1, and patches
exist for earlier versions of BIND. (BIND is widely used Internet DNS software.) RPZs are local zone files that allow
the DNS resolver to respond to specific DNS requests by saying the domain name does not exist (NXDOMAIN),
redirecting the user to a “walled garden” (a closed platform), or other possibilities.
To mitigate the effects of single bit errors for users of a DNS resolver, the resolver administrator can create an RPZ
that protects against bitsquats of frequently resolved or internal-only domain names. For example, the RPZ can be
set up so that any requests made to the DNS resolver for bitsquat variants of these domains will get a NXDOMAIN
response, silently “correcting” bit errors without any work on the part of the client experiencing the bit error.24

Brute-Force Login Attempts
a Favored Tactic to
Compromise Websites
Although brute-force login attempts are by no means a new
tactic for cybercriminals, their use increased threefold in the first
half of 2013.
In the course of investigation, researchers with Cisco TRAC/SIO discovered a hub of data used
to feed such actions. It included 8.9 million possible username and password combinations,
including strong passwords—not just the easy-to-crack “password123” variety. Stolen user
credentials help to keep this list, and others like it, well stocked.

[ Key targets for recent brute-force login attempts are widely used content-management
system (CMS) platforms such as WordPress and Joomla. Successful attempts to gain
unauthorized access through a CMS give attackers the ability to upload PHP (hypertext
preprocessor) backdoors and other malicious scripts to compromised websites. In some
cases, the compromise can enable attackers to find a path to a hosting server, which can
then be commandeered ] (Figure 28).

Considering that there are more than 67 million WordPress sites around the world—and that
publishers are using the platform to create blogs, news sites, company sites, magazines,
social networks, sports sites, and more—it’s not surprising that many
online criminals have their sights set on gaining access through
this CMS.25 Drupal, a rapidly growing CMS platform, has been
targeted this year as well; for example, in May, users were
advised to change their passwords because “unauthorized
access [to Drupal] was made through third-party software
installed on the Drupal.org server infrastructure.”26
But it isn’t just the popularity of these systems that makes

them desirable targets. Many of these sites—though active—
have been largely abandoned by their owners. There are likely
millions of abandoned blogs and purchased domains sitting idle, and
many of them are probably now owned by cybercriminals. Cisco security
experts predict the problem will only worsen as more and more people in emerging Internet
markets around the globe establish a blog or a website, only to let it languish later.
The widespread use of plugins, which are designed to extend the functionality of a CMS and
to power videos, animations, and games, is also proving to be a boon for miscreants looking to
gain unauthorized access to platforms like WordPress and Joomla. Many CMS compromises
observed by Cisco researchers in 2013 can be traced back to plugins written in the PHP web
scripting language that were designed poorly and without security in mind.

DNS Amplification:

Mitigation Techniques

[Attacks launched through DNS

amplification will remain a concern
in 2014, according to Cisco security
experts. The Open Resolver Project
(openresolverproject.org) reports
that as of October 2013, 28 million
open resolvers on the Internet pose a
“significant threat.” (Consider that the
Spamhaus DDoS attack of 300 Gbps
used only 30,000 open resolvers.)

]

If a resolver is open, that means it
is not filtering where it is sending
responses. DNS uses the UDP
protocol, which is stateless, meaning
a request can be made on behalf
of another party. That party then
receives an amplified amount of
traffic. This is why identifying open

them—is something the industry

DDoS Attacks:
What’s Old Is
New Again
Distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attacks—which disrupt traffic to and from
targeted websites and can paralyze
ISPs (Internet service providers)—have
been increasing in both volume
and severity.
Because DDoS attacks had long been considered “old
news” in terms of cybercrime techniques, many enterprises
were confident the security measures they had in place
could provide adequate protection. But that confidence has
been shaken by large-scale DDoS attacks in 2012 and
2013, including Operation Ababil, which was directed at
several financial institutions and likely politically motivated.27
“DDoS attacks should be a top security concern for
organizations in the public and private sector in 2014,” says
John N. Stewart, senior vice president and chief security
officer at Cisco. “Expect future campaigns to be even more
extensive and to last for extended periods. Organizations,
particularly those that operate or have interests in industries
that are already prime targets, such as financial services and
energy, need to ask themselves, ‘Can we be resilient against
a DDoS attack?’”
A new twist: Some DDoS attacks are probably being used
to conceal other nefarious activity, such as wire fraud before,

a source address not allocated to
that customer.30 The BCP was coauthored by Cisco, which offers
guidelines on deploying uRPF, its
implementation.31
Another mitigation technique is
to configure all authoritative DNS
servers to use rate limiting. The
authoritative nameserver, which
serves an enterprise’s domain,
is generally open to all requests.
DNS response rate limiting (DNS
RRL) is a feature that can be turned
on to prevent a DNS server from
answering the same question from
the same entity too many times—thus
protecting the enterprise from being
used as an intermediary in DDoS
attacks. DNS RRL is enabled on DNS
servers and it is one way for a server
administrator to limit how effectively
a server can be used by attackers in
amplification attacks. DNS response
rate limiting is a newer feature, and it
is not supported by all DNS servers;
however, it is supported by ISC BIND,
a popular DNS server.
In addition, all recursive DNS servers
need to be configured with an access
control list (ACL) so they will respond
only to queries from hosts on their
own network. A poorly managed
ACL can be a primary factor in DNS
attacks, especially on large servers
with large amounts of available
bandwidth. This technique also helps

These attacks can overwhelm bank personnel, prevent
transfer notifications to customers, and prevent customers
from reporting fraud. And by the time an institution recovers
from such an event, it is unable to recoup its financial
losses. One such attack that took place on December 24,
2012, targeted the website of a regional California financial
institution and “helped to distract bank officials from an online
account takeover against one of its clients, netting thieves
more than $900,000.”28
Rapidly deepening expertise in compromising hosting
servers will only make it easier for cybercriminals to launch
DDoS attacks and steal from targeted organizations
(see “Fractures in a Fragile Ecosystem,” page 43). By
commandeering a portion of the Internet’s infrastructure,
malicious actors can take advantage of large amounts
of bandwidth, positioning them to launch any number of
powerful campaigns. It’s already happening: In August 2013,
the Chinese government reported that the largest DDoS
attack it had ever faced shut down the Chinese Internet for
about four hours.29
Even spammers are using DDoS attacks to strike back
at organizations they believe are standing in the way of
their revenue generation. In March 2013, the nonprofit
Spamhaus—which tracks spammers and created the
Spamhaus Block List, a directory of suspect IP addresses—
was the target of a DDoS attack that temporarily shut down
its website and slowed Internet traffic worldwide. The
attackers were allegedly affiliated with the Netherlandsbased CyberBunker, a hosting provider with permissive
terms of use, and STOPhaus, which has publicly expressed
its dislike for Spamhaus’s activities. The DDoS attack
came after the widely used Spamhaus service included
CyberBunker on its blacklist. In apparent retaliation,

DarkSeoul
As noted in “DDoS Attacks: What’s Old Is
New Again,” cybercriminals’ new focus and
fast-growing expertise in compromising
hosting servers is only making it easier
to launch DDoS attacks and steal from
organizations.
Cisco security researchers warn that future DDoS campaigns
are likely to be capable of creating both significant disruption
and damage—including financial loss due to theft.
The DarkSeoul targeted attacks of March 2013 involved
“wiper” malware designed to destroy data in the hard drives
of tens of thousands of PCs and servers. The attacks
targeted financial institutions and media firms in South Korea,
with the payload set to activate at the same time. The wiper
malware appears to be only one facet of the attack, however.
At the same time the malware was triggered, the website
of the Korean network provider LG U+ was defaced and
the networks of other targeted organizations started going
down—capabilities not reproducible in the wiper malware.32

58

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Industry

Some believe the attacks were a result of cyberwarfare instituted by North Korea to disrupt
South Korea economically or an act of sabotage by another nation-state. But the possibility
exists that the DarkSeoul attacks were meant to conceal financial gain.33
Security researchers are still trying to understand these attacks—and discover who was
responsible for them—but evidence indicates that plans for DarkSeoul may have been put
in motion as far back as 2011. In that year, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) first
warned of the emergence of banking trojans designed to conceal the wiring of fraudulent
funds from victims’ accounts.34 Then, in 2012, the RSA security firm reported on a new breed
of cybercriminals constructing a sophisticated trojan campaign that would launch an attack
on a scheduled day and attempt to “to cash out as many compromised accounts as possible
before its operations are ground to a halt by security systems.”35 And on Christmas Eve
2012, online thieves used a DDoS attack as a cover while they stole from a regional California
financial institution.36
One malware binary identified in the DarkSeoul attacks that targeted media organizations and
financial institutions is a banking trojan that specifically targeted customers of those same
Korean banks, according to Cisco TRAC/SIO investigators. That fact, along with the timeline
of cybercrime trends leading up to DarkSeoul, indicates the campaign could have been theft
made to look like something else.

Ransomware

[ Throughout 2013, attackers have increasingly moved away
from traditional botnet-driven infections on PCs. Part of this
shift included the increased use of ransomware as the final
malware payload from compromised websites, malicious
email, and downloader trojans. Ransomware is a category
of malware that prevents the normal operation of infected
systems until a prescribed fee is paid. ]

and economic downturns, but the motivation for cybercriminals is the loss of botnet availability
and accessible exploit kits due to takedowns.
In the fall of 2013, a new type of ransomware, dubbed CryptoLocker, began encrypting
victims’ files with a combination of RSA 2048-bit key pairs and AES-256, considered
unfeasible to break. In action, CryptoLocker move files beyond the local machine to include
matching file types on any writeable mapped drive. Upon completion of the encryption
routine, victims are presented with a series of dialog boxes that provide detailed instructions
for payment of the ransom (Figure 29). A timer is also presented instructing the victim to
pay within a specific time (ranging from 30 to 100 hours). The dialog further warns that if the
ransom is not paid in the allotted time, the private key will be deleted from the commandand-control server, after which the chance to decrypt the files will be lost.
CryptoLocker surged in mid-October, possibly in response to the loss of the Blackhole and
Cool exploit kits following the arrest of the alleged author of those frameworks.

and steal data—have outstripped the ability of IT and security
professionals to address threats. Most organizations do not have
the people or the systems to monitor their networks consistently
and to determine how they are being infiltrated. ]
The security talent shortage makes this problem worse: even
when budgets are generous, CISOs struggle to hire people
with up-to-date security skills. It’s estimated that by 2014,
the industry will still be short more than a million security
professionals across the globe. Also in short supply are
security professionals with data science skills—understanding
and analyzing security data can help improve alignment with
business objectives. (See the appendix on page 68, “Security
Organizations Need Data Scientists: Introductory Data Analysis
Tools for Security Practitioners.”)

Cloud as a New Perimeter
As CISOs tell Cisco security experts (see page 18), moving
ever-increasing amounts of critical business data to the cloud
is a growing security concern.
The cloud revolution, says Michael Fuhrman, Cisco vice president of engineering, is
comparable to the rise in web-based solutions in the late 1990s.
“This was a radical shift in business use of new technology—and at
that same time, we saw a rise in online attacks from criminals,”
says Fuhrman. “Today, the radical shift comes from the cloud.
Not only do businesses host many of their critical applications
in the cloud, but they are also using the cloud to consume
and analyze critical business information.”
The rise in cloud computing is undeniable and unstoppable.

The rise in
cloud computing
is undeniable and
unstoppable.

Cisco has projected that cloud network traffic will grow more
than threefold by 2017.37

[ In 2014 and onward, security professionals can expect to see entire
corporate perimeters move to the cloud. These network edges have been in the process of
becoming far less well-defined in recent years. But with so many applications and so much
data in the cloud, organizations are rapidly losing the ability to see who and what is moving in
and out of corporate boundaries, and what actions users are taking. ]

This transition to the cloud changes the game because it redefines where data is stored,
moved, and accessed—and creates greater opportunities for attackers.
Adding to fears about ceding the control of data to the cloud is lack of information about how
cloud vendors defend their products against security breaches. Organizations often don’t ask
enough questions about what is contained in their vendors’ service-level agreements, or how
often vendors upgrade their security software or patch vulnerabilities.

62

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Industry

Organizations need reassurance that a cloud provider is using the most sophisticated tools
and strategies available to thwart attacks, or to detect and stop them while in progress. For
information security teams, the decision to move forward often comes down to one question:
“What controls should I look for in a provider to trust it to manage and protect my data?”
On the other side of the fence, cloud providers struggle with identifying and implementing
a manageable set of controls mapped to an increasing number of international regulations,
which are needed to address an increasingly hostile threat environment.
“When we choose vendors for security and critical infrastructure, we often buy based on
technical qualifications and reputation,” says John N. Stewart, senior vice president and chief
security officer at Cisco. “Lately, the vendor’s process and evolving security approach have
also become increasingly important factors.”
Coincidentally, the very things that make the cloud a threat—such as the location outside the
network perimeter and the increasing use of the cloud for business-critical data—can enable
organizations to make more accurate and near-real-time security decision making. With more
traffic going through the cloud, security solutions that also rely on the cloud can quickly and
easily analyze this traffic and gain from this supplemental information. In addition, for smaller
organizations or those with budget constraints, a well-protected and well-managed cloud
service can offer more security safeguards than a business’s own servers and firewalls.

Objectives for 2014:
Verifying Trustworthiness
and Improving Visibility
Today, in an environment where the level of trust associated
with a network or device must be dynamically evaluated,
organizations are faced with fragmented security models that
provide inconsistent enforcement, isolated threat intelligence,
and a proliferation of vendors and products to manage.
The connections among organizations, data, and the advanced attacks launched by malicious
actors are simply too complex for a single appliance to address. And most organizations lack
security personnel with the expertise and experience to help them adapt their security models
to the challenges—and opportunities—presented by cloud computing, mobility, and other new
ways of doing business that are driven by technology advancements.
The past year has seen organizations of all types struggling to understand how to embrace
innovation without creating new security gaps or widening known ones. 2013 also brought
the issue of trust to the forefront. Users of all types are now even more likely to question the
trustworthiness of the technology they rely on every day whether at work or in their personal
lives. It is therefore more important than ever for technology vendors to help assure customers
that security is a priority in their manufacturing processes—and to be prepared to back up
those assurances.

[“We are in a market transition where trust matters, and process and technology must be
integral features of product design for a vendor to meet the needs of today’s threats,” says
Cisco chief security officer John N. Stewart. “A company’s promise is insufficient. Firms
need verification through certified products, integrated development processes, innovative
technology, and respected standing in the industry. Organizations also must make it an
ongoing priority to verify the trustworthiness of the technology products they use and the

vendors that supply them.” ]

65

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Recommendations

Improving the alignment between security operations and business objectives is also an
important measure for strengthening enterprise security. In a climate of limited resources
and anemic budgets, this alignment can help CISOs and other security executives in the
organization to identify key risks and appropriate mitigation approaches. Part of this process
is the acceptance of the fact that not all corporate resources can be completely protected
at all times. “Come to an agreement as to what is most important from a cybersecurity
perspective,” says Gavin Reid, director of threat intelligence for Cisco. “This is a more
productive approach than hoping to find a magic pill that can fix everything.”
To meet today’s security challenges head on, organizations need to examine their security
model holistically and gain visibility across the entire attack continuum:

• Before an attack: To defend their network, organizations must be aware of what’s on it:

devices, operating systems, services, applications, users, and more. Additionally, they must
implement access controls, enforce security policies, and block applications and overall
access to critical assets. However, policies and controls are only a small piece of a bigger
picture. These measures can help to reduce the surface area of attack, but there will always
be gaps that attackers will find and exploit to achieve their objectives.

• During an attack: Organizations must address a broad range of attack vectors with solutions
that operate everywhere that a threat can manifest itself—on the network, on endpoints,

from mobile devices, and in virtual environments. With effective solutions in place, security
professionals will be better positioned to block threats and help to defend the environment.

• After an attack: Invariably, many attacks will be successful. This means organizations need
to have a formal plan in place that will allow them to determine the scope of the damage,
contain the event, remediate, and bring operations back to normal as quickly as possible.

[ “Attackers and their tools have advanced to evade traditional defenses. The reality is that it’s
no longer a matter of if attackers get in, but when,” says Marty Roesch, chief security architect
for the Security Group at Cisco. “A visibility-driven and threat-focused approach to security is
needed to protect users across the attack continuum—before, during, and after an attack.” ]

How Services Help Meet Security Challenges
With a greater attack surface, the increasing proliferation and sophistication of attack models, and the growing
complexity within the network, more organizations are struggling to solidify a security vision that uses new
technologies, simplifies their architecture and operations, and strengthens their team.
Lack of security talent, as discussed on page 60, complicates these issues. In addition, the security industry is
innovating faster than organizations can adopt and operationalize these new tools.
Finding the right talent to address the evolving security landscape effectively can be a challenge. Bringing in
complementary outside resources can not only help to reduce costs, but also allow the business to free up resources
to focus on higher priorities.

Strengthening the Chain Where It Weakens
Preventing threats is of course paramount to maintaining cybersecurity. This is why, with more online criminals
shifting their focus toward compromising the Internet’s infrastructure instead of individual computers, Cisco security
experts recommend that ISPs and hosting companies take a more active role in helping to protect the integrity
of the Internet.
Identifying difficult-to-detect threats like DarkLeech and Linux/CDorked (see page 45) requires much more “human
responsiveness” on the part of hosting providers. Such responsiveness includes fully investigating reports from users
and taking them seriously. Providers also need to establish better controls to make sure they can verify the integrity
of their server operating system installations. Cisco investigators say that with stealthy malware like CDorked,
security teams would have had no way of knowing that the binary had been replaced if a control had not already
been in place to verify the integrity of the installation.
Systems of individual users are susceptible to compromise, of course, but the weakening in the chain often begins
long before a threat reaches them. More often now, the attack happens in the middle of the chain, which is why
providers need to have better awareness about potential threats that target the Internet’s infrastructure.

Security Organizations
Need Data Scientists
Introductory Data Analysis Tools for Security Practitioners
Chief security officer (CSO) teams are collecting an unprecedented amount of data, and
the intelligence captured in that data is much too valuable to go unused. Analyzing securityrelevant data provides clues into attackers’ activities and gives actionable insight into how to
thwart attacks.
Data analysis is not new to the security practitioner. There is also an expectation among
security practitioners that records will be generated and labeled. Pen-testers create a record
of investigation after an assessment. Operating system designers implement
auditing subsystems. Application developers design applications that
generate logs.
Regardless of what the records are called, one thing is certain:
Security practitioners have a great deal of data—and analyzing
that data can lead to important discoveries.
While data analysis itself is not new, the evolution of the
security landscape has had an impact on the process of data
analysis:

• The frequency with which ad hoc data analysis is needed is increasing.
• Standardized reports, while helpful, are insufficient.

69

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Appendix

Fortunately, the barrier to entry for security practitioners to do data analysis, even in this
more complex environment, is low—and the data analysis tools ecosystem is rich. Following
is an overview of just some of the freely available tools that practitioners can use to start
analyzing data.

Analyzing Traffic with Wireshark and Scapy
Two tools that excel in doing traffic analysis are Wireshark and Scapy. Wireshark needs no
introduction. Scapy is a Python-based tool that can be used, either as a Python module or
interactively, for crafting or inspecting traffic.
Wireshark’s rich set of command-line tools and protocol dissectors make it indispensable.
For example, with the use of Wireshark’s tcp.stream display filter field, a pcap file containing
multiple TCP streams can be broken into smaller files that each contain all the packets
belonging to a single TCP stream.
Figure A1 shows this command that prints the TCP stream index of the first five TCP packets
in traffic_sample.pcap.

Figure A1

The tshark Command to Extract the tcp.stream Index

tshark -r traffic_sample.pcap -T fields -e tcp.stream tcp | head -n 5

tshark is one of Wireshark’s
command-line tools.

tcp.stream refers to the TCP
display filters stream index field.

70

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Appendix

With that knowledge, one can write a script that will split traffic_sample.pcap into individual
pcap files:
$ cat ~/bin/uniq_stream.sh
#!/bin/bash
function getfile_name() {
orig_name=$1
stream=$2
file_name=”$(echo $orig_name | cut -d’.’ -f1)”
file_name+=”-${stream}.pcap”
echo “${file_name}”
return 0
}
streams=$(tshark -r ${1} -T fields -e tcp.stream | sort -un | tr ‘\n’ ‘ ‘)
for x in ${streams}
do
file_name=$(getfile_name ${1} ${x})
echo “Creating ${file_name}...”
tshark -r ${1} -w $file_name tcp.stream eq ${x}
done
$

The script creates a single pcap file for each of the 147 TCP streams in traffic_sample.pcap.
It is now easier to do further analysis on each TCP stream. Note that non-TCP packets from
traffic_sample.pcap will not be in any of the new pcap files:
$ /bin/uniq_stream.sh traffic_sample.pcap
Creating traffic_sample-1.pcap...
Creating traffic_sample-2.pcap...
…
…
Creating traffic_sample-146.pcap...
Creating traffic_sample-147.pcap...

71

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Appendix

Scapy has its own strengths. Since it is developed in Python, all the features of the Python
language and other Python tools can be used. The following snippet demonstrates how Scapy
makes use of operator overloading so that crafting traffic can be done rapidly and intuitively:
# scapy
>>> dns_query = IP()/UDP()/DNS()
>>> from socket import gethostbyname,gethostname
>>> dns_query[IP].src = gethostbyname(gethostname())
>>> dns_query[IP].dst = “8.8.8.8”
>>> import random
>>> random.seed()
>>> dns_query[UDP].sport = random.randint(0, 2**16)
>>> dns_query[DNS].id = random.randint(0, 2**16)
>>> dns_query[DNS].qdcount = 1
>>> dns_query[DNS].qd = DNSQR(qname=“www.cisco.com”)
>>> scapy.sendrecv.sr1(dns_query)
>>> response = scapy.sendrecv.sr1(dns_query)
Begin emission:
............Finished to send 1 packets.
.*
Received 14 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets
>>> response[DNS].ar[DNSRR].rdata
‘64.102.255.44’
>>>

This example shows how packets can be constructed and how live traffic can be analyzed.
However, Scapy can be used to analyze pcap files just as easily.

Analyzing CSV Data
Comma-separated values (CSV) is a popular format for exchanging data. Many tools
(including tshark) allow the user to export data in CSV format. Typically, security practitioners
use spreadsheet programs like Excel to analyze CSV data. It is also often possible to use
command-line tools like grep, cut, sed, awk, uniq, and sort.
Consider using csvkit as an alternative. Csvkit provides several utilities that make it easier to
process CSV data from the command line. Examine the following CSV file and notice how
easy it is to find all lines that have the tty.example.org host in the src column:
$ head -n 3 tcp_data.csv
src,srcport,dst,dstport
“tty.example.org”,“51816”,”vex.example.org”,”443”
“vex.example.org”,”443”,”tty.example.org”,”51816”
$ csvgrep -n tcp_data.csv
1: src
2: srcport
3: dst
4: dstport
$ csvgrep -c 1 -r ‘tty\.example\.org’ tcp_data.csv | head -n 5
src,srcport,dst,dstport
tty.example.org,51816,vex.example.org,443
tty.example.org,51816,vex.example.org,443
tty.example.org,51427,paz.example.org,5222
tty.example.org,51767,bid.example.org,80

73

Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report

Csvkit includes a host of utilities. Csvstat is particularly useful as it automatically computes
various statistics. For example, it is easy to compute the frequency of the top five src hosts:
$ csvstat -c 1 tcp_data.csv
1. src
<type ‘unicode’>
Nulls: False
Unique values: 55
5 most frequent values:
tty.example.org:

Matplotlib, Pandas, IPython, and Others
A rich set of Python-based data analysis and visualization tools is available. A great place
to discover these tools is the SciPy site (http://www.scipy.org). Of particular interest are the
Matplotlib, pandas, and IPython packages:

• Matplotlib allows for easy, flexible and visualization.
• Pandas provides tools to manipulate and examine raw data.
• IPython brings features to the Python interpreter that facilitate interactive data analysis.

Start Analyzing Data
The examples on the previous pages are barely a drop in the ocean and do not do justice to
the tools referenced. However, they are enough for security practitioners to start performing
meaningful data analysis.
CSOs need to have their security practitioners wear data scientist hats. Diving into available
data will yield insights that are not otherwise possible. Over time, intuition about what parts
of the data to explore will develop. Some organizations may even find they can benefit from
having dedicated data scientists on their teams.
