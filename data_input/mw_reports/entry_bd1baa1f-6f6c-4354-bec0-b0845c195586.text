Recently Cyble researchers came across a post where a researcher mentioned about fake Proof of
Concept (POC) of CVE-2022-26809. Upon further investigation, we discovered that it’s malware
disguised as an Exploit. Similarly, we found a malicious sample that appears to be a fake POC of CVE2022-24500. Both the malicious samples were available on GitHub. Interestingly both repositories belong
to the same profile, indicating the possibility that Threat Actor (TA) might be hosting a malware campaign
targeting Infosec Community.
Figures 1 and 2 show the malware hosted on GitHub.

TA used this unique technique to lure individuals into executing the malware. In the last 24 hours, TAs
were also discussing these exploits on the cybercrime forum. For example, we came across a post
where TAs discussed CVE-2022-24500, pointing to the fake POC GitHub repository, as shown in Figure
3.

Technical Details:
The malware is a .Net binary packed with ConfuserEX, a free, open-source protector for .NET
applications. The figure below shows the file details.

Figure 4: File

details
The malware does not have any exploit code targeting the above vulnerabilities. Instead, it prints a fake
message showing that it is trying to exploit and executes shellcode, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Prints fake message
The malware uses the Sleep() function to print the messages after a small interval, to appear more
legitimate. Figure 6 shows the code snippet of malware that print fake messages on execution.

Figure 6: Unpacked Code
After printing the fake message, the malware executes the hidden PowerShell command using cmd.exe
to deliver the actual payload. The below figure depicts the network communication to a command-andcontrol server for downloading the Cobalt-Strike Beacon.

Figure 7: Network communication
The Cobalt-Strike Beacon can be used for other malicious activities such as downloading additional
payloads, lateral movement, etc. This fact possibly indicates that the infosec community is also an active
target of attackers.

Conclusion

5/6

TAs are adopting various techniques to carry out attacks. In this case, we witnessed how the TA used
fake POCs to lure the victims into executing the malware. Usually, people working in information security
or TAs use exploits to check for vulnerabilities. Hence, this malware might only target people from this
community. Therefore, it becomes essential for the Infosec Community members to check the credibility
of sources before downloading any proof of concept.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Avoid downloading files from unknown websites.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their authenticity.
Educate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted URLs.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.
Enable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solution on the employees’ systems.
