It’s hardly news to anyone who follows cyberthreat intelligence that the Lazarus APT group
targets financial entities, especially cryptocurrency exchanges. Financial gain remains one of
the main goals for Lazarus, with its tactics, techniques, and procedures constantly evolving
to avoid detection.
In the middle of 2018, we published our Operation Applejeus research, which highlighted
Lazarus’s focus on cryptocurrency exchanges utilizing a fake company with a backdoored
product aimed at cryptocurrency businesses. One of the key findings was the group’s new
ability to target macOS. Since then Lazarus has been busy expanding its operations for the
platform.
Further tracking of their activities targeting the financial sector enabled us to discover a new
operation, active since at least November 2018, which utilizes PowerShell to control
Windows systems and macOS malware for Apple users.

Infection procedure

Lazarus is a well-organized group, something that can be seen from their malware
population: not only have we seen them build redundancy to reserve some malware in case
of in-operation hot spare replacement of ‘burnt’ (detected) samples but they also conform to
specific internal standards and protocols when developing backdoors. This case is no
different. They have developed custom PowerShell scripts that communicate with malicious
C2 servers and execute commands from the operator. The C2 server script names are
disguised as WordPress (popular blog engine) files as well as those of other popular open
source projects. After establishing the malware control session with the server, the
functionality provided by the malware includes:
Set sleep time (delay between C2 interactions)
Exit malware
Collect basic host information
Check malware status
Show current malware configuration
Update malware configuration
Execute system shell command
Download & Upload files
Lazarus uses different tactics to run its C2 servers: from purchasing servers to using hacked
ones. We have seen some legitimate-looking servers that are most likely compromised and
used in malicious campaigns. According to server response headers, they are most likely
running an old vulnerable instance of Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 on Microsoft
Windows Server 2003. Another C2 server was probably purchased by Lazarus from a
hosting company and used to host macOS and Windows payloads. The geography of the
servers varies, from China to the European Union. But why use two different types of
servers? The group seems to have a rule (at least in this campaign) to only host malware on
rented servers, while hosting C2 scripts for malware communication on compromised
servers.

Infrastructure segregation by purpose

The malware was distributed via documents carefully prepared to attract the attention of
cryptocurrency professionals. Seeing as how some of the documents were prepared in
Korean, we believe that South Korean businesses are a high priority for Lazarus. One
document entitled ‘Sample document for business plan evaluation of venture company’
(translated from Korean) looks like this:

Another macro-weaponized document (e9a6a945803722be1556fd120ee81199) contains a
business overview of what seems to be a Chinese technology consulting group named
LAFIZ. We couldn’t confirm if it’s a legitimate business or another fake company made up by
Lazarus. Their website lafiz[.]link has been parked since 2017.

Based on our telemetry, we found a cryptocurrency exchange company attacked with a
malicious document containing the same macro. The document’s content provided
information for coin listings with a translation in Korean:

The payloads show that Lazarus keeps exploring more ways to evade detection to stay
under the radar longer. The group builds malware for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows separately
to support both platforms and have more variety in terms of compiled code. The Windows
payloads distributed from the server (nzssdm[.]com) hosting the Mac malware have a
CheckSelf export function, and one of them (668d5b5761755c9d061da74cb21a8b75) has
the internal name ‘battle64.dll’. From that point we managed to find additional Windows
malware samples containing the CheckSelf export function and an internal name containing
the word ‘battle’.
These Windows malware samples were delivered using malicious HWP (Korean Hangul
Word Processor format) documents exploiting a known PostScript vulnerability. It should be
noted that HWP documents are only popular among Korean users (Hangul Word Processor
was developed in South Korea) and we have witnessed several attacks using the same
method.

Connection with previous HWP attacks

It’s no secret that Apple products are now very popular among successful internet startups
and fintech companies, and this is why the malicious actor built and used macOS malware.
While investigating earlier Lazarus incidents, we anticipated this actor would eventually
expand its attacks to macOS.
It appears that Lazarus is using the same developers to expand to other platforms, because
some of the features have remained consistent as its malware evolves.

Overlap of current campaign and previous hwp-based attack cases

We’d therefore like to ask Windows and macOS users to be more cautious and not fall victim
to Lazarus. If you’re part of the booming cryptocurrency or technological startup industry,
exercise extra caution when dealing with new third parties or installing software on your
systems. It’s best to check new software with an antivirus or at least use popular free virusscanning services such as VirusTotal. And never ‘Enable Content’ (macro scripting) in
Microsoft Office documents received from new or untrusted sources. Avoid being infected by
fake or backdoored software from Lazarus – if you need to try out new applications, it’s
better do so offline or on an isolated network virtual machine which you can erase with a few
clicks. We’ll continue posting on Lazarus’s latest tactics and tricks in our blog. In the
meantime, stay safe!
