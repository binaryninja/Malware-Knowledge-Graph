Project Description:
The project explores operating systems vulnerabilities in protecting against common threats of
malware. The project will be a demonstration of how malware type Trojan is created and
executed in the targeted machines.
Keyplexer is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) written in Python. It combines the functionalities of
Keylogger with remote access abilities. Meaning, that not only the program records all
movements of the user, but also has access to the machine live through the created backdoor
or Trojan.
