Overview:
Recently, AT&T Alien Labs identified a new malware family that is actively scanning for
exposed web services and default passwords. Based on our findings we are calling it “Xwo” taken from its primary module name. It is likely related to the previously reported malware
families Xbash and MongoLock.
Alien Labs initially identified Xwo being served from a server serving a file named xwo.exe.
Below are the initial technical findings of Xwo, while all associated indicators are in our Xwo
OTX Pulse.

Xwo’s relation to MongoLock & XBash:
MongoLock is a ransomware that wipes MongoDB servers and demands a ransom paid to
the attackers to recover their database. Both Xwo and MongoLock use similar Python-based
code, command and control (“C2”) domain naming, and have an overlap in C2 infrastructure.

Unlike MongoLock, Xwo does not have any ransomware or exploitation capabilities, but
rather sends stolen credentials and service access back to the C2 infrastructure.
The sample was created via PyInstaller and the original Python code can be easily recover
using python_exe_unpack and uncompyle6. The python script of Xwo contains code copied
from XBash:

As of this report, it is unclear if Xwo relates with same adversary known as “Iron Group”, or if
they have repurposed public code. Based on our research to date, a potential relationship
may exist between Iron Cybercrime Group and Rocke. We are unable to assess the
relationship with acceptable confidence as of this report.

Command and Control:
Following execution, Xwo first performs an HTTP POST request with a random User-Agent
from a hardcoded list of choices, and then receives instructions from the C2 domain with an
encoded public network range to scan:

The IP range supplied by the C2 infrastructure is base64 encoded and zlib compressed. As
received in Figure 1, we can decode the response
“eJwzMjDSM7Qw0DM0M9Yz0DcyAQAaQwMX” with Python, or a CyberChef recipe to view
the range to attack next:
"eJwzMjDSM7Qw0DM0M9Yz0DcyAQAaQwMX".decode('base64').decode('zlib')
Results in the range:
202.180.163.0/24
To get the list of command and control servers it uses hardcoded data stored in base64
encoding:
o0OO0oo0oOO = ['xm3f3sc84Lf96Nbwr+n/k0fQ98hd0wZadHDILvY4hb0=',
'HGL91M2wOu+nLP1xlsNujqDjbbP5TktwjNaFtORL0oo=',
'NNlmU+31V4LIV/j1Yo2lAehyF6eWj8tL1xXQsn+Liug=',
3/9

'NNlmU+31V4LIV/j1Yo2lAaicPP4buKiGYusLhKxS7AA=']
Which decodes into:
s.propub3r6espa33w[.]tk
s.blockchainbdgpzk[.]tk
s.pcrisk[.]xyz
s.rapid7[.]xyz
The above C2 infrastructure is associated with MongoLock, which is found in our OTX Pulse
for that malware family. The entity behind the creation of the referenced C2 infrastructure
follows patterns of registering domains mimicking security and news organizations and
websites like Rapid7 (rapid7.com), PCRisk (pcrisk.com), and ProPublica’s onion site
(propub3r6espa33w.onion) but with .tk TLDs. This trend serves as supplemental links to the
above mentioned reports to other malware families.
We have contacted CloudFlare to report the C2 domains, and they have since been
terminated, preventing further use by the adversary.

Scanning & Spreading:
First Xwo scans the network range provided by the command and control server. It then
commences reconnaissance activity to collect information on available services. We assess
the adversary collects this information for later use by the attacking entity. Collected
information includes:
Use of default credentials in FTP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Memcached.
Tomcat default credentials and misconfigurations.
Default SVN and Git paths.
Git repositoryformatversion content.
PhpMyAdmin details.
Www backup paths.
RealVNC Enterprise Direct Connect.
RSYNC accessibility.

The results of the script are then sent back to the command and control server through an
HTTP POST request.

Conclusion:
The Alien Labs findings around Xwo introduce yet another iteration from what has been a
rather publicity attracting adversary. While Xwo steps away from a variety of malicious
features observed the entity using, such as ransomware or exploits, the general use and
potential it holds can be damaging for networks around the globe. Xwo is likely a new
step to an advancing capability, and we expect the full value of this information collection tool
to be acted on in the future.
Network owners should avoid the use of default service credentials and ensure publicly
accessible services are restricted when possible. We are unable to assess what exactly the
operators behind Xwo will use this information for, but based on links to MongoLock and
Xbash we expect it to be abused for further malicious activity in time.
