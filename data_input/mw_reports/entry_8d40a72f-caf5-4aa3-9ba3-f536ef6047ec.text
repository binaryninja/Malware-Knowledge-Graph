Top CVEs Actively Exploited By People’s Republic of
China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-279a

Summary
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides the top Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVEs) used since 2020 by People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored
cyber actors as assessed by the National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). PRC statesponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and
allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property
and develop access into sensitive networks.
This joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and state,
local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the Defense
Industrial Base Sector; and private sector organizations about notable trends and persistent
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
NSA, CISA, and FBI urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and private
sector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section and
Appendix A to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of compromise from
PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber actors.
For more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s China
Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage, FBI’s Industry Alerts, and NSA’s
Cybersecurity Advisories & Guidance.

Technical Details
NSA, CISA, and FBI continue to assess PRC state-sponsored cyber activities as being one
of the largest and most dynamic threats to U.S. government and civilian networks. PRC
state-sponsored cyber actors continue to target government and critical infrastructure
networks with an increasing array of new and adaptive techniques—some of which pose a
significant risk to Information Technology Sector organizations (including telecommunications
providers), Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organizations, and other critical
infrastructure organizations.

1/18

PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities and use publicly
available tools to target networks of interest. NSA, CISA, and FBI assess PRC statesponsored cyber actors have actively targeted U.S. and allied networks as well as software
and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive
networks. See Table 1 for the top used CVEs.

Path Traversal

These state-sponsored actors continue to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to obfuscate
their activities and target web-facing applications to establish initial access. Many of the
CVEs indicated in Table 1 allow the actors to surreptitiously gain unauthorized access into
sensitive networks, after which they seek to establish persistence and move laterally to other
internally connected networks. For additional information on PRC state-sponsored cyber
actors targeting network devices, please see People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored
Cyber Actors Exploit Network Providers and Devices.

Mitigations

3/18

NSA, CISA, and FBI urge organizations to apply the recommendations below and those
listed in Appendix A.
Update and patch systems as soon as possible. Prioritize patching vulnerabilities
identified in this CSA and other known exploited vulnerabilities.
Utilize phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication whenever possible. Require all
accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords, and change
passwords immediately if there are indications that a password may have been
compromised.
Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge.
Upgrade or replace end-of-life devices.
Move toward the Zero Trust security model.
Enable robust logging of Internet-facing systems and monitor the logs for anomalous
activity.

Appendix A
Table II: Apache CVE-2021-44228
Apache CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 3.0: 10 (Critical)
Vulnerability Description
Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and
2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect
against malicious actor controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. A malicious
actor who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary
code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j
2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2,
2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this
vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache
Logging Services projects.
Recommended Mitigations
Apply patches provided by vendor and perform required system updates.
Detection Methods
See vendor’s Guidance For Preventing, Detecting, and Hunting for Exploitation of
the Log4j 2 Vulnerability.

Table XVI: Apache CVE-2022-24112
Apache CVE-2022-24112 CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical)
Vulnerability Description
A malicious actor can abuse the batch-requests plugin to send requests to bypass the IP
restriction of Admin API. A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is
vulnerable to remote code execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of
Admin API was changed to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But
there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a
check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But
due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed.

14/18

Recommended Mitigations
In affected versions of Apache APISIX, you can avoid this risk by explicitly
commenting out batch-requests in the conf/config.yaml and conf/config-default.yaml
files and restarting Apache APISIX.
Update to 2.10.4 or 2.12.1.

Table XXI: Apache CVE-2021-41773
Apache CVE-2021-41773 CVSS 3.0: 7.5 (High)
Vulnerability Description
This vulnerability has been modified since it was last analyzed by NVD. It is awaiting
reanalysis, which may result in further changes to the information provided. A flaw
was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. A
malicious actor could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the
directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not
protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied," these requests can
succeed. Enabling CGI scripts for these aliased paths could allow for remote code
execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache
2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 is incomplete (see
CVE-2021-42013).
Recommended Mitigations
Apply update or patch.
Detection Methods
Commercially available scanners can detect CVE.
