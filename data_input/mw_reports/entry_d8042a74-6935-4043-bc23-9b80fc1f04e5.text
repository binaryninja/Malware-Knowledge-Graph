The SVR is Russia’s civilian foreign intelligence service and is the successor organization to
the KGB’s First Chief Directorate. It predominantly targets overseas governmental,
diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets for intelligence purposes. It is
technologically advanced, developing capabilities to try to operate undetected against
countries in Europe, NATO members and its near neighbours.
A compromise of SolarWinds IT services firm was discovered in December 2020.
SolarWinds confirmed 18,000 organisations across the world including US Government
departments were affected. The overall impact on the UK of the SVR’s exploitation of this
software is low. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) advice on how to protect against this
threat is available
The NCSC has assessed that it is highly likely Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Services are
responsible for the compromise of SolarWinds software, Orion, and subsequent targeting.
