The CrowdStrike 2022
Global Threat Report
provides crucial insights
into what security teams
need to know about to
stay ahead of today's
threats in an increasingly
ominous threat
landscape.

F

or security teams on the front lines and those of us in the business
of stopping cyberattacks and breaches, 2021 provided no rest for the
weary. In the face of massive disruption brought about by the COVIDdriven social, economic and technological shifts of 2020, adversaries
refined their tradecraft to become even more sophisticated and brazen. The result
was a series of high-profile attacks that rocked many organizations and, on their
own, represented watershed moments in cybersecurity.
As organizations scrambled at the start of 2021 to protect supply chains and
interconnected systems in the face of the incredibly sophisticated Sunburst attack,
adversaries exploited zero-day vulnerabilities and architectural limitations in legacy
systems like Microsoft to leave many reeling. At the same time, eCrime syndicates
refined and amplified big game hunting (BGH) ransomware attacks that ripped
across industries, sowing devastation and sounding the alarm on the frailty of our
critical infrastructure.
For security teams already dealing with an ongoing skills shortage, these issues
proved challenging enough on their own. But the strain on security teams was
amplified even more at the end of the year when the ubiquitous Log4Shell
vulnerability threatened a complete security meltdown.
Understanding these events gives visibility into the shifting dynamics of adversary
tactics, which is critical for staying ahead of today’s threats. This is the context
that the CrowdStrike 2022 Global Threat Report delivers. Developed based on the
firsthand observations of our elite CrowdStrike Intelligence and Falcon OverWatch™
teams, combined with insights drawn from the vast telemetry of the CrowdStrike
Security Cloud, this year’s report provides crucial insights into what security teams
need to know about an increasingly ominous threat landscape.

Among the details you’ll learn in this year’s report:
How state-sponsored adversaries targeted IT and cloud service providers
to exploit trusted relationships and supply chain partners
How state-sponsored adversaries weaponized vulnerabilities to evade
detection and gain access to critical applications and infrastructure
How sophisticated adversaries exploited stolen credentials and identities
to amplify ransomware BGH attacks and infiltrate cloud environments
How malicious actors intensified attacks on critical cloud infrastructure
with new, sophisticated approaches

Enterprise risk is
coalescing around three
critical areas:
Endpoints
and cloud workloads
Identity
Data

Our annual report also paints a picture that shows enterprise risk is coalescing
around three critical areas: endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data. Threat
actors continue to exploit vulnerabilities across endpoints and cloud environments,
and ramp up innovation on how they use identities and stolen credentials to bypass
legacy defenses — all to reach their goal, which is your data. CrowdStrike has
observed that 62% of attacks comprise non-malware, hands-on-keyboard activity.
As adversaries advance their tradecraft in this manner to bypass legacy security
solutions, autonomous machine learning alone is not good enough to stop dedicated
attackers.
CrowdStrike is relentless in our drive to keep you ahead of adversaries today and
into the future. To meet the adversaries head-on, we’re unifying a modern approach
to security with a platform that connects the machine both to the identity and the
data to deliver full Zero Trust protection. As adversaries shift to targeting cloud
workloads, we’re providing deep visibility and proactive security across the entire
cloud-native stack. To alleviate the burden of the constant cycle of patching,
we’re prioritizing the vulnerabilities that create the most risk. And for the most
sophisticated attacks, we’ve delivered powerful new extended detection and
response (XDR) capabilities to help overwhelmed security teams automate response
and reduce the time it takes to hunt across domains.
2021 taught us that no matter how much adversity we face, the adversary will not
rest. Attacks are growing more destructive, causing mass disruption in all aspects
of our daily lives. But this is the challenge we’ve accepted and a fight that we will
win together. I hope you find this report informative and that it gives you the same
clarity of purpose it gives me: to be unrelenting in our drive to stop adversaries from
stopping business and our way of life.

Introduction
In 2021,
targeted intrusion
adversaries continued
to adapt to the
changing operational
opportunities and
strategic requirements
of technology and world
events.

A

s we reflect upon 2021, two overarching themes come to the forefront:
adaptability and perseverance. Businesses are finding paths forward
with new technologies and solutions, adapting in the face of adversity
and persevering in spite of uncertainty as we continue to navigate the
challenges of living through a global pandemic. While these issues will ultimately
lead to strength and innovation in organizations around the world, they will also
create new risks and vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
Cyber adversaries kept pace in 2021 with many adapting to a changing target
landscape. This trend was perhaps best exemplified by the shifts observed in
the 2021 eCrime ecosystem, which — while remaining vast and interconnected —
comprises many criminal enterprises that exist to support big game hunting (BGH)
ransomware operations. Notably, adversaries in 2021 were able to circumvent
actions that threatened cessation of their operations, and some even resorted
to rebranding as a result. Despite new approaches taken by law enforcement,
including attempts to seize ransom payments and criminal funds before they
reached adversaries’ hands, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed an 82% increase in
ransomware-related data leaks in 2021, compared to 2020. This increase, coupled
with other data leaks, is a stark reminder of the value that adversaries place on
victim data.
In 2021, targeted intrusion adversaries continued to adapt to the changing
operational opportunities and strategic requirements of technology and world
events. Russian, Chinese, Iranian and North Korean adversaries were all observed
employing new tradecraft or target-scopes meant to respond to global trends.
This included: Russia’s targeting of IT and cloud service providers to exploit
trusted relationships; China’s weaponization of vulnerabilities at scale to facilitate
initial access efforts; Iran’s use of ransomware to blend disruptive operations with
authentic eCrime activity; and Democratic People's Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) shift
to cryptocurrency-related entities in an effort to maintain illicit revenue generation
during economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.

Governments are also adapting. This year, CrowdStrike Intelligence debuted two
new adversary animals — WOLF and OCELOT — to label targeted intrusions
emanating from Turkey and Colombia, respectively. The presence of these
new adversaries underscores the increase in offensive capabilities outside of
governments traditionally associated with cyber operations, and highlights the
variety of actor end goals. Private sector offensive actors (PSOAs), such as NSO
Group and Candiru, continued to serve as hackers-for-hire throughout 2021,
providing governments with substitute or supplemental capabilities and further
enlarging the global actor space.
In the hacktivist landscape, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the continued
development of grassroots operations and a proliferation of established hacktivist
groups across the world. The rise of Belarusian group Cyber Partisans since
late 2020, the expanded role and diversification of the broader Iranian hacktivist
ecosystem, and the growing participation of various hacktivists in response to
Western political developments all exemplify this trend.
As our adversaries adapt, so do we. CrowdStrike Intelligence offered an unparalleled
level of coverage throughout 2021, adding 21 named adversaries and raising the
total of tracked actors across all motivations to over 170. CrowdStrike Intelligence
continues to expand coverage of threat landscapes beyond targeted intrusion,
eCrime and hacktivist mission areas; in 2021, we increased support for vulnerability
intelligence and mobile intelligence across all our products.
In 2021, CrowdStrike launched Falcon X Recon+ as a companion service for Falcon
X Recon™. Falcon X Recon+ analysts manage monitoring, triaging, assessing
and mitigating threats across the criminal underground. They also assess and
recommend effective mitigation steps, helping customers act decisively and
proactively to prevent and detect future attacks. CrowdStrike's Falcon X Elite
service was also expanded in 2021 to provide a single point of contact for
onboarding, product integration, intelligence clarification, personalized threat
briefing and intelligence research. Falcon X Elite analysts continue to provide
proactive notifications of threats to CrowdStrike customer organizations.
The CrowdStrike 2022 Global Threat Report summarizes the entirety of analysis
performed by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team throughout 2021, including
descriptions of notable themes, trends and significant events in cybersecurity. This
analysis, combined with case studies from the Falcon OverWatch™ managed threat
hunting team, demonstrates how threat intelligence and proactive hunting can
provide a deeper understanding of the motives, objectives and activities of these
actors — information that can empower swift proactive countermeasures to better
defend your valuable data now and in the future.

Threat Landscape
Overview
eCrime Breakout Time
1 hour 38 minutes

Today’s eCrime adversaries move with speed and
purpose in pursuit of their objectives.
The CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch team measures
breakout time — the time an adversary takes to move
laterally from an initially compromised host to another host
within the victim environment. Our analysis of the breakout
time for hands-on eCrime intrusion activity in 2021 — where
such a metric could be derived — revealed an average of
just 1 hour 38 minutes.
This number is essentially unchanged from what was
reported by CrowdStrike’s Falcon OverWatch team in the
CrowdStrike 2021 Threat Hunting Report, when breakout
time for eCrime actors was measured at 1 hour 32 minutes.
eCrime adversaries continue to show a high degree of
sophistication as evidenced by the speed at which they can
move through a victim environment, leaving a very short
window for defenders to respond.

Adversary Tactics
Malware-Free

Detections indexed by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud in Q4 2021

Adversaries continue to show
that they have moved beyond malware.
Attackers are increasingly attempting to accomplish
their objectives without writing malware to the
endpoint. Rather, they have been observed using
legitimate credentials and built-in tools — an
approach known as “living off the land” (LOTL) — in
a deliberate effort to evade detection by legacy
antivirus products. Of all detections indexed by the
CrowdStrike Security Cloud in the fourth quarter of
2021, 62% were malware-free.

Ransomware
and the
Ever-adaptable
Adversary
The growth and impact of BGH in 2021 was a palpable force felt across all sectors
and in nearly every region of the world. Although some adversaries and ransomware
ceased operations in 2021, the overall number of operating ransomware families
increased. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed an 82% increase in ransomwarerelated data leaks in 2021, with 2,686 attacks as of Dec. 31, 2021, compared to 1,474
in 2020. These figures, coupled with other data leaks, highlight how valuable victim
data is to adversaries.

Figure 3. Comparison of Data Leaks by Sector (Top 10), 2020 vs. 2021

At times, the BGH landscape has been unpredictable, and adversaries have not
always been able to immediately gauge the success or outcome of their ransomware
operations. This change in landscape fluidity was observed following operations
that targeted large organizations and resulted in attention and action from the
highest levels of U.S. government and law enforcement, causing some adversaries to
rebrand or even deactivate their tools.
The impact of government and law enforcement action on eCrime operations was
also observed in the CrowdStrike eCrime Index (ECX). For example, increased
media and law enforcement attention after the Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods
incidents conducted by CARBON SPIDER and PINCHY SPIDER affiliates resulted in
a reduction in data leaks and access broker advertisements, which caused the ECX
to dip, recover and remain volatile to date. For more detail, read this blog.
New tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in data theft attacks in 2021
aided adversaries in extorting their victims. For example, adversaries such as
BITWISE SPIDER avoided using publicly available exfiltration tools by developing
their own. Another major development was increased data theft and extortion
without the use of ransomware, leading to the establishment of new marketplaces
dedicated to advertising and selling victim data.
However, one key theme highlighted throughout 2021 is that adversaries will
continue to react and move operations to new approaches or malware wherever
possible, demonstrating that the ever-adaptable adversary remains the key threat
within the eCrime landscape.

Falcon OverWatch

Case Study
WIZARD SPIDER Accesses Multiple Servers
During Targeted BGH Operation
WIZARD SPIDER was a prolific figure on the ransomware scene in 2021. With a wealth of custom tooling at their
disposal and proficiency at using native utilities to progress their intrusions, WIZARD SPIDER identified and developed
a successful business model. OverWatch uncovered this threat actor in an intrusion against an organization in the
engineering vertical. The TTPs observed throughout this intrusion were consistent with targeted BGH activity seen from
WIZARD SPIDER in the past. The intrusion spanned four domain controllers and two valid accounts.

Domain
Controller
Count: 1

Defense Evasion and Discovery
WIZARD SPIDER utilized RDP to authenticate into a
Windows Domain Controller via a valid domain account.
The Falcon sensor raised the first of multiple detections
when malware was injected into the legitimate MSTSC
process by a custom shellcode loader, ShellStarter. Falcon
OverWatch uncovered the adversary leveraging two
native utilities, BITSadmin and Rundll32, to download and
execute their custom tooling. OverWatch hunters quickly
zeroed in on uncovering the activity’s context, armed with
CrowdStrike Falcon® sensor telemetry providing insights
into the associated process trees. A notification was then
pushed to the victim organization.

Persistence
The threat actor created a scheduled task to
execute ShellStarter at a later date, potentially with
the intent to reinfect the victim.

Domain
Controller
Count: 2

Credential Access
Command and Control (C2)
The actor pushed a rogue DLL file to another server
before executing the DLL using the Microsoft signed
binary Rundll32. In this instance, the WIZARD SPIDER tool,
AnchorDNS, was used to perform C2 connections over the
DNS protocol. Multiple encoded DNS requests were sent
outbound to the C2 nameserver.

Domain
Controller
Count: 4

Persistence
Acting on CrowdStrike's notifications, the victim
organization’s incident response took over at this point and
began eliminating the actor within the environment. During
remediation, OverWatch identified WIZARD SPIDER returning
to a fourth domain controller using a new administrator
account. OverWatch rapidly notified the victim, and the actor
was once again removed from the environment.

Minutes later, WIZARD SPIDER moved laterally using RDP
to access a second domain controller using the same valid
credentials. Here they used the built-in Ntdsutil utility to
harvest credentials by copying the NTDS database.

Domain
Controller
Count: 3

Lateral Movement
WIZARD SPIDER moved laterally to a third domain controller
through a Windows administrative share and set AnchorDNS to
run as a service using native tooling.

2021 Themes

Iran and the
New Face of
Disruptive
Operations
CrowdStrike Intelligence
is currently tracking
several adversaries and
activity clusters that are
engaged in lock-and-leak
operations.

Since late 2020, multiple Iran-nexus adversaries and activity clusters have adopted
the use of ransomware as well as “lock-and-leak” disruptive information operations
(IO) to target multiple organizations within the U.S., Israel and the greater Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) region. Lock-and-leak operations are characterized
by criminal or hacktivist fronts using ransomware to encrypt target networks and
subsequently leak victim information via actor-controlled personas or entities.
Since they inauthentically operate as a criminal or hacktivist entity, these types
of operations conduct activity beneath a veneer of deniability. Through the use
of dedicated leak sites, social media and chat platforms, these actors are able to
amplify data leaks and conduct IO against target countries.
At present, CrowdStrike Intelligence is tracking several adversaries and activity
clusters that are engaged in lock-and-leak operations. Based on available data,
PIONEER KITTEN was the first adversary to switch from conducting likely traditional
targeted intrusion operations to lock-and-leak activities in 2021. Following that,
SPECTRAL KITTEN (aka BlackShadow), the ChaoticOrchestra activity cluster (aka
Deus) and the SplinteredEnvoy activity cluster (aka Moses Staff) were observed
primarily targeting Israeli entities with lock-and-leak operations throughout 2021
using multiple ransomware families.
In contrast to the publicity-seeking operations and lock-and-leak campaigns
observed throughout 2021, disruptive activity associated with the NEMESIS KITTEN
adversary lacked a distinct messaging component and largely operated discreetly.
NEMESIS KITTEN conducted wide-ranging scanning and exploitation operations
to establish footholds in various networks, and in select instances, conducted
ransomware operations using BitLocker, a likely unique ransomware variant called
SunDawn, and, in one case, a custom wiper.
The use of high-profile lock-and-leak operations, as well as the more subdued but
pervasive NEMESIS KITTEN activity, provides Iran with an effective capability to
disruptively target its rivals in the region and abroad. Given the success of these
operations, Iran will likely continue to use disruptive ransomware into 2022.

Falcon OverWatch

Case Study
NEMESIS KITTEN Thwarted at Every Turn
In late 2021, OverWatch uncovered a hands-on intrusion against a South American technology entity. The observed
TTPs, along with the use of specific tooling including the Fatedier Reverse Proxy tool, were consistent with activity
previously attributed to the threat actor tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as NEMESIS KITTEN. The actor’s efforts
were largely unsuccessful because they were blocked at every turn by the Falcon sensor.

Defense Evasion
The actor was observed making numerous
attempts to disable Windows Defender, including
modifying the Windows registry to disable
Windows Defender real-time monitoring and using
PowerShell to create a scheduled task configured
to use the Set-MpPreference cmdlet to impair
Windows Defender protections. This was the first
of multiple attempted attack techniques blocked by
the Falcon sensor.

Discovery

Persistence and C2
The actor attempted to create a scheduled task to
download and execute the Fatedier Reverse Proxy tool
configured to communicate with known NEMESIS KITTEN
C2 infrastructure. This attempt was prevented by the
Falcon sensor. In an attempt to establish persistence, the
actor created a new local user account, then added the
account to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users
local groups. The adversary then set the account password
to never expire. Additionally, the actor unsuccessfully
attempted to modify the registry to enable inbound RDP
connections.

After the failed attempts to establish persistence
and C2, NEMESIS KITTEN undertook host and user
reconnaissance, which included efforts to locate
Domain Controller-related information.

Credential Access
Finally, the actor attempted to perform credential harvesting
by modifying the registry to enable WDigest and allow for the
storage of credentials in plain text. The actor then attempted
to use PowerShell, along with Rundll32, to launch
comsvcs.dll with minidump and extract contents of
Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). This
attempt proved unsuccessful as well, thanks to the advanced
capabilities of the Falcon sensor.

China Emerges
as Leader in
Vulnerability
Exploitation
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed China-nexus actors deploying exploits for new
vulnerabilities at a significantly elevated rate in 2021, when compared to 2020.
In 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence confirmed the exploitation by China-nexus
actors — including WICKED PANDA — of two vulnerabilities published in 2020:
CVE-2020-14882 (Oracle WebLogic) and CVE-2020-10189 (Zoho ManageEngine).
In 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence confirmed China-nexus actor exploitation of
12 vulnerabilities published in 2021, affecting nine different products. Ten named
adversaries or activity clusters were linked to the exploitation of these vulnerabilities
and a number of other incidents were identified in which activity was likely linked to
unnamed Chinese actors.
Chinese actors have long developed and deployed exploits to facilitate targeted
intrusion operations; however, 2021 highlighted a shift in their preferred exploitation
methods. For years, Chinese actors relied on exploits that required user interaction,
whether by opening malicious documents or other files attached to emails or visiting
websites hosting malicious code. In contrast, exploits deployed by these actors in
2021 focused heavily on vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices or services.

2021 Themes
China Emerges as Leader in
Vulnerability Exploitation
In 2021, Chinese actors focused significant attention on a series of vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Exchange — now collectively known as ProxyLogon and ProxyShell — and
used them to launch intrusions against numerous organizations worldwide. Chinese
adversaries also continued to exploit internet-routing products such as VPNs and
routers for both infrastructure acquisition and initial access purposes. Enterprise
software products hosted on internet-facing servers were also popular targets.
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed Chinese actors exploit products for initial access in
a range of intrusions such as Zoho ManageEngine, Atlassian Confluence and GitLab.1
Activity from China-nexus actors in 2021 highlighted their range of exploitacquisition capabilities. Chinese targeted intrusion actors likely independently
developed a number of the observed exploits or acquired them from in-country
security researchers. In particular, the Tianfu Cup hacking competition demonstrates
the significant exploitation development talent within China’s hacker community.
Exploits submitted at the Tianfu Cup have later been acquired by Chinese targeted
intrusion actors for use in their operations. In several 2021 incidents, Chinese actors
demonstrated an ability to rapidly operationalize public proof-of-concept (POC)
exploit code for newly acknowledged vulnerabilities.

Falcon OverWatch

Case Study
Suspected PANDA Exploits Microsoft Exchange Server
Vulnerabilities Against Think Tank
Falcon OverWatch uncovered a targeted threat actor conducting a hands-on intrusion against a Europe-based think tank.
The activity, which spanned multiple Windows-based hosts, began after the successful exploitation of a known Microsoft
Exchange vulnerability. The adversary employed several notable TTPs in an effort to secure a persistent foothold in
the victim environment. The adversary also showed a particular interest in gathering credential information, using four
distinct credential dumping and harvesting techniques.

Initial Access
The adversary gained initial access to the primary host
following the successful compromise of the Microsoft
Exchange application pool MSExchangeOWAAppPool.
OverWatch hunters promptly discovered this malicious
access after seeing the Microsoft IIS worker process
w3wp.exe writing an unknown executable on the host,
with malicious scripts being written to a web directory.
This activity included command execution indicative
of China Chopper web shell usage, triggering an initial
Falcon detection.

Discovery
Initial access was immediately followed by attempts
at broad host- and user-based reconnaissance
operations.

Execution

Persistence and Lateral Movement
In a likely attempt to preserve access in case the web
shells were made unavailable, the adversary also deployed
implants across several hosts and attempted execution
using trusted utilities including the Microsoft .NET ClickOne
Launch Utility and Rundll32. The adversary was able to use
Rundll32 to successfully load their implant WmiAd.dll,
which was configured to beacon to an adversary-controlled
IP. The adversary also configured a scheduled task to
persist the implant execution by setting it to launch on
host startup. The adversary then moved laterally, using
compromised credentials to authenticate to three hosts of
interest. They then copied their working implant file to the
hosts and created a scheduled task to preserve access.

Operating as the SYSTEM user, the adversary deployed
multiple instances of the China Chopper web shell and
attempted to execute them via PowerShell beneath the
IIS worker process w3wp.exe, but they were immediately
detected by the Falcon sensor. The adversary was largely
unsuccessful in their efforts to bypass existing controls by
deploying several renamed versions of the Microsoft Windows
command shell to execute further malicious tasking.

Credential Access
The adversary attempted multiple LOTL techniques to extract
the contents of the LSASS memory space and seek credential
information stored in files.
The second attempt involved the use of the Microsoft
Sysinternals tool ProcDump. The third attempt saw the
adversary leverage their own tooling, executing a loader that
was then used to launch a probable credential dumping binary.
Finally, the adversary used the findstr command to search
for credential-related information contained in .xml files on a
remote share.

Log4Shell
Sets the
Internet
on Fire
Routine discovery, disclosure and subsequent exploitation of a series of high-profile
vulnerabilities occurred throughout 2021. Due to the number of potentially affected
endpoints, Log4Shell received more attention than any other vulnerability.
Apache’s Log4j2 is an ubiquitous logging library used by many web applications.
A vulnerability reported in November 2021 and tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and
“Log4Shell” can be exploited by remote attackers to inject arbitrary Java code into
affected services. Specially crafted requests may result in access to the system,
delivery of malware or acquisition of sensitive data such as user credentials.
Between Dec. 9-31, 2021, a variety of groups incorporated Log4Shell exploitation
into their arsenal (Figure 5). Opportunistic eCrime actors aggressively engaged
in widespread Log4Shell exploitation most commonly affiliated with commodity
botnet malware (e.g., Muhstik). However, other eCrime-focused actors — including
affiliates of DOPPEL SPIDER and WIZARD SPIDER — adopted Log4Shell as an
access vector to enable ransomware operations. Additionally, state-nexus actors,
including NEMESIS KITTEN and AQUATIC PANDA, were also affiliated with probable
Log4Shell exploitation before the end of 2021.

in the Wild
Figure 5. Timeline of Log4Shell Events and Affiliated Actors

The initial wave of opportunistic Log4Shell attacks was very simple, and each exploit
was structured nearly identically. However, achieving reliable remote code execution
(RCE) via CVE-2021-44228 on various impacted platforms potentially requires the
actor to tailor the Log4Shell exploit for a specific target. While this adds effort, this
tailoring has not prevented actors such as AQUATIC PANDA from leveraging more
specific versions of CVE-2021-44228 exploits. In particular, CrowdStrike Intelligence
and industry sources linked Log4Shell exploitation to the compromise of VMware
products.
Due to the widespread nature of the Log4j2 logging library, it is difficult to assess
which products are vulnerable and ensure they are protected against exploitation.
Targeting of CVE-2021-44228 by criminal threat groups is increasing and will
continue into 2022.

Many state-operated actors are likely to integrate Log4Shell exploits into their
toolchain, since this logging library provides a method through which actors can gain
access to target environments via vulnerable entry point systems or move laterally
by exploiting internal servers on already compromised networks. This assessment
is based on the vulnerability’s massive prevalence. However, all impacted products
cannot be exploited with the same technique, and tailoring of exploits for specific
targets may be required.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that actors will continue to integrate increasingly
effective exploit chains to rapidly achieve RCE. This assessment is made with
moderate confidence based on the substantial number of incidents facilitated by
multistage exploit chains — such as ProxyShell and ProxyLogon — that proved
commonplace during 2021.

Falcon OverWatch

Case Study
PROPHET SPIDER Leverages Log4j Exploit for Attempted
Credential Harvesting from a Cloud Workspace Service
PROPHET SPIDER is a prolific access broker with a track record of successfully leveraging known vulnerabilities to
gain access to web servers and cloud services in order to harvest credentials. OverWatch recently uncovered a handson intrusion against a U.S.-based financial services entity following the successful compromise of a VMware Horizon
web component. Observed TTPs were consistent with those previously seen from PROPHET SPIDER and included the
retrieval of tooling from an actor-controlled IP, along with host and domain reconnaissance.

C2 and Persistence
Upon initial access to the host, PROPHET SPIDER
immediately leveraged obfuscated PowerShell
to download a wget binary, which they then used
to download a custom proxy tool. The suspicious
PowerShell activity triggered an initial Falcon sensor
detection, and OverWatch hunters created additional
notifications on the actor’s activity.

Discovery
PROPHET SPIDER performed host and
active directory reconnaissance, including the
enumeration of domain trust information along with
active directory topology and replication status.

Execution and Discovery
PROPHET SPIDER used the Windows Command
shell to launch their custom proxy tool, winntaa.exe.
Once executed, they leveraged it to conduct more
discovery operations, including gathering information
on domain trusts and running processes.

Defense Evasion
PROPHET SPIDER proceeded to delete their tooling
from the host in an effort to prevent artifact recovery
operations.

Increasing
Threats
to Cloud
Environments
Cloud-based services now form crucial elements of many business processes,
easing file sharing and collaboration. However, these same services are increasingly
abused by malicious actors in the course of computer network operations (CNO),
a trend that is likely to continue in the foreseeable future as more businesses seek
hybrid work environments. Common cloud attack vectors used by eCrime and
targeted intrusion adversaries include cloud vulnerability exploitation, credential
theft, cloud service provider abuse, use of cloud services for malware hosting and
C2, and the exploitation of misconfigured image containers.

2021 Themes
Increasing Threats
to Cloud Environments

Cloud Vulnerability Exploitation
Malicious actors tend to opportunistically exploit known RCE vulnerabilities in server
software, typically scanning for vulnerable servers without focusing on particular
sectors or regions. After initial access, actors may deploy a variety of tools. Wider
criminal exploitation of cloud services for initial access includes the exploitation of
Accellion FTA vulnerabilities. Since January 2021, multiple companies have selfdisclosed breaches related to the exploitation of such vulnerabilities.
VMware has also been targeted by threat actors, including CVE-2021-21972 — a
critical vulnerability impacting VMware ESXi, vCenter Server and Cloud foundation
products. Targeting this vulnerability provides a simple and reliable method for
exploitation that threat actors can use across multiple host-operating systems,
attack vectors and intrusion stages. Multiple adversaries, particularly BGH actors,
have likely leveraged this vulnerability.

Credential Theft
Credential-based intrusions against cloud environments are among the more
prevalent exploitation vectors used by eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries.
Criminal actors routinely host fake authentication pages to harvest legitimate
authentication credentials for cloud services such as Microsoft Office 365 (O365),
Okta or online webmail accounts. Actors then use these credentials to attempt to
access victim accounts.
Access to cloud-hosted email or file-hosting services can also facilitate espionage
and theft of information. In April 2021, CrowdStrike observed COSMIC WOLF
targeting victim data stored within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud
environment. The adversary compromised the AWS environment via a stolen
credential that allowed the operator to interact with AWS using the command line.
Employing this technique, the adversary altered security group settings to allow
direct SSH access from malicious infrastructure.

Cloud Service Provider Abuse
Adversaries have leveraged cloud service providers to abuse provider trust
relationships and gain access to additional targets through lateral movement from
enterprise authentication assets hosted on cloud infrastructure. If an adversary
can elevate their privileges to global administrator levels, they may be able to pivot
between related cloud tenants to further their access.
This issue is particularly significant if the initially targeted organization is a managed
service provider (MSP). In this case, global administrator access can be used to
take over support accounts used by the MSP to make changes to their customer
networks, thereby creating multiple opportunities for vertical propagation to many
more networks. This technique was used by COZY BEAR throughout 2020, with
evidence of continued intrusion in MSP networks continuing into 2021.

Malware Hosting and
Command and Control
Both eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries extensively leverage legitimate cloud
services to deliver malware; targeted actors also use these services for command
and control. This tactic has the advantage of being able to evade signature-based
detections, because top-level domains of cloud hosting services are typically trusted
by many network scanning services. Using legitimate cloud services, including chat
applications, can enable adversaries to evade some security controls by blending
into normal network traffic. Moreover, using cloud-hosting providers for C2 allows
the adversary to switch or remove payloads from an affiliated C2 URL with ease.

Exploitation of Misconfigured
Image Containers
Criminal actors have periodically exploited improperly configured Docker containers.
Docker images are templates used for creating containers. These images can be
used either on a standalone basis, for users to directly interact with a tool or service,
or as the parent to another application. Because of this hierarchical mode, if an
image has been modified to contain malicious tooling, any container derived from it
will also be infected.
In 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence reported on the malware family Doki, which uses
containers as both an initial infection vector and as a means for parallel track
tasking. Once malicious actors gain access, they can abuse these escalated
privileges to accomplish lateral movement and then proliferate throughout the
network.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has also continued to track adversary operations involving
the access and modification of constituent parts of Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes
is an open-source container-orchestration system that automates the deployment,
scaling and management of applications and their associated shared resources.
Falcon OverWatch has observed increasing adversary interest in Kubernetes
clusters operating within corporate environments. The Kubernetes framework
is a complex system comprising a number of constituent parts allowing ample
opportunity for misconfiguration that could provide an adversary with initial access
to one component and subsequent lateral propagation opportunities that provide
access to desired resources.

Threat Highlight:
Russian Adversaries Look to the Cloud
FANCY BEAR
The FANCY BEAR adversary is associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special
Services (aka Military Unit 26165) of Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).
Earlier in its operational lifespan, when conducting victim exploitation and credential
collection, the adversary extensively used spear-phishing emails containing
malicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure. However,
after multiple exposures of its operations — particularly by the U.S. Department of
Justice (DOJ) in 2018 — FANCY BEAR appears to have reevaluated their operational
tradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use
of credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and
victim-tailored phishing websites.
Credential harvesting plays a significant role in FANCY BEAR’s acquisition of
intelligence and primary access into target organizations or individuals. Adapting
to the trend of public and private entities increasingly hosting parts of their internal
infrastructure (e.g., email, internal chat, or identity and device-management services)
via cloud services, the adversary has targeted numerous cloud-based email
providers with a variety of collection methodologies throughout 2021. Examples
of targeted email providers include enterprise services such as Microsoft 365 or
GSuite, as well as webmail services more likely used by individuals. The adversary’s
credential-collection operations have technically matured over the years while
maintaining a consistently high volume and tempo.

COZY BEAR
Throughout 2021, COZY BEAR also repeatedly demonstrated a high level of
post-exploitation proficiency, particularly involving the enumeration of, and lateral
movement within, cloud environments. During a CrowdStrike Services investigation,
COZY BEAR operators were identified using authentication cookie theft to bypass
multifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks. This
technique leverages existing local network access and has been used to access
user accounts in possession of enterprise cloud service privileges. This technique
highlights the adversary’s ability to use a range of post-compromise activities to
expand their access and maximize intelligence collection.
Future operations consistent with this cluster of COZY BEAR-associated activity are
highly likely to continue mirroring this behavior, particularly through the successive
identification and compromise of user accounts that are assigned administrative
or special privileges on cloud services and tenants. This assessment is made with
moderate confidence based on the increasing application of MFA restrictions
on cloud service access and the consistency of COZY BEAR-related operations
identified to date.

Conclusion
CrowdStrike Intelligence
continues to provide
industry-leading actor
profiles, malware analysis
and campaign tracking
through its suite of
intelligence reporting
products and coverage of
threat landscapes.

In 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed adversaries continue to adapt to security
environments impacted by the ongoing COVID pandemic. These adversaries are
likely to look at novel ways in which they can bypass security measures to conduct
successful initial infections, impede analysis by researchers and continue tried-andtested techniques into 2022.
BGH operations will continue to dominate the eCrime landscape in 2022, likely
significantly increasing their use of ransomware from ransomware-as-a-service
(RaaS) operations in an effort to allow for a wider array of adversarial skill sets.
The access broker market will also continue as an avenue for ransomware
operators to gain victims, removing the initial access step and allowing swifter
deployment of malware.
Targeted intrusion adversaries are expected to continue to capitalize on trends
in technology and the broader threat landscape throughout 2022 in attempts to
maximize impacts while minimizing effort. (In 2021, this behavior was reflected in
Iran’s shift to disruptive ransomware, China’s emphasis on vulnerability exploitation —
often at scale — to achieve initial access to victims, and Russia’s targeting of cloud
service providers and environments.) Cloud-related threats are particularly likely
to become more prevalent and to evolve, given that targeted intrusion adversaries
are expected to continue prioritizing targets that provide direct access to large
consolidated stores of high-value data.
As today’s world continues to increasingly rely on mobile devices, some adversaries
will continue to diversify their tool arsenal to include mobile malware — either to
make money and/or collect sensitive information. Similarly, adversaries will continue
to seek weaknesses in platforms used by their targets in 2022; opportunities to
exploit vulnerabilities will be capitalized upon once they are discovered. Through
the coming year, adversaries are expected to continue to react to vulnerability
identification and seek to gain access to their targets through exploitive means as
quickly as possible.
In response to these evolving threats, CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to provide
industry-leading actor profiles, malware analysis and campaign tracking through its
suite of reporting products and coverage of threat landscapes spanning targeted
intrusion, eCrime, hacktivist, vulnerability and mobile threat intelligence.

Protect All Workloads
An organization is only secure if every asset is protected. You must secure all
critical areas of enterprise risk: endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.
Look for solutions that deliver hyper-accurate detections, automated protection
and remediation, elite threat hunting and prioritized observability of vulnerabilities.
Establish strong IT hygiene with an asset inventory and consistent vulnerability
management. Remember, it’s impossible to defend systems you don’t know are
there.

Know Your Adversary
There is a human behind every cyberattack. If you know the adversaries that
target the industry or the geolocation your organization resides in, you can prepare
yourself to better defend against the tools and tactics they employ.
CrowdStrike Falcon X intelligence identifies today’s bad actors and exposes their
playbook to enable security teams to proactively optimize preventions, strengthen
defenses and accelerate incident response.

Be Ready When Every Second Counts
Speed often dictates success or failure. It’s especially true in cybersecurity where
stealthy breaches can occur in a matter of hours with devastating consequences.
Security teams of all sizes must invest in speed and agility for their daily and
tactical decision making by automating preventive, detection, investigative and
response workflows with integrated cyber threat intelligence directly observed from
the front lines.

Stop Modern Attacks
Nearly 80% of cyberattacks leverage identity-based attacks to compromise
legitimate credentials and use techniques like lateral movement to quickly evade
detection. CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Threat Protection enables hyper-accurate
threat detection and real-time prevention of identity-based attacks, combining the
power of advanced AI, behavioral analytics and a flexible policy engine to enforce
risk-based conditional access.

Adopt Zero Trust
As adversaries want to monetize their activity, they target their victim’s data seeking
payoffs through ransom and extortion, and will even auction data to the highest
bidder. Because today’s global economy requires data to be accessible from
anywhere at any time, it is critical to adopt a Zero Trust model. The CrowdStrike
Zero Trust solution connects the machine to the identity and the data to deliver full
Zero Trust protection.

Monitor the Criminal Underground
Adversaries congregate to collaborate using a variety of hidden messaging
platforms and dark web forums. In addition to monitoring your own environment,
security teams must be vigilant and monitor activity within the criminal underground.
Leverage digital risk monitoring tools like Falcon X Recon to monitor imminent
threats to your brand, identities or data. Get advance warnings of active threats and
use this visibility to prevent data leak incidents and costly ransomware attacks.

The most common causes of cloud intrusions continue to be human errors such as
omissions introduced during common administrative activities. It’s important to set
up new infrastructure with default patterns that make secure operations easy to
adopt. This strategy ensures that new accounts are set up in a predictable manner,
eliminating common sources of human error. Also, make sure to set up roles and
network security groups that keep developers and operators from needing to build
their own security profiles and accidentally doing it poorly.

Invest in Elite Threat Hunting
CrowdStrike has observed that 62% of attacks comprise non-malware, hands-onkeyboard activity. As adversaries advance their tradecraft in this manner to bypass
legacy security solutions, autonomous machine learning alone is not good enough to
stop dedicated attackers. The combination of technology with expert threat hunters
is absolutely mandatory to see and stop the most sophisticated threats. Top-quality
managed services such as Falcon Complete and Falcon OverWatch can help you
close the growing cyber skills gap with the expertise, resources and coverage
needed to augment your team.

Build a Cybersecurity Culture
While technology is clearly critical in the fight to detect and stop intrusions, the
end user remains a crucial link in the chain to stop breaches. User awareness
programs should be initiated to combat the continued threat of phishing and
related social engineering techniques. For security teams, practice makes perfect.
Encourage an environment that routinely performs table top exercises and red/
blue teaming to identify gaps and eliminate weaknesses in your cybersecurity
practices and response.
