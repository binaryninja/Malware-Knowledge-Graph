China-Linked Group TAG-28
Targets India’s “The Times Group”
and UIDAI (Aadhaar) Government
Agency With Winnti Malware

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Executive Summary
India continues to bear the brunt of hostile cyber
operations from Chinese state-sponsored groups.
Earlier this year, Insikt Group documented a RedEcho
campaign targeting India’s critical national infrastructure
following a rapid deterioration in bilateral relations after
both countries clashed on the China-India border. We
also recently identified renewed RedFoxtrot operations
targeting an Indian state-owned enterprise involved in
the nuclear, space, and defense sectors.
Following this theme of Chinese targeting of Indian
entities, we have identified further suspected intrusions
targeting the Indian media conglomerate Bennett
Coleman And Co Ltd (BCCL), commonly known as “The
Times Group”; the Unique Identification Authority of India
(UIDAI); and the Madhya Pradesh Police department.
The UIDAI is the Indian government agency responsible
for the national identification database, more commonly
called “Aadhaar”, which contains private biometric
information for over 1 billion Indian citizens. These
intrusions were conducted by an activity group we track
using a temporary designation, TAG-28 1.

Chinese state-sponsored intrusions targeting news
outlets is not a recent phenomenon. In 2013, the New
York Times, the Washington Post, and Bloomberg News
were targeted by a Chinese group in a widespread
intelligence-gathering operation following a series of
published articles that were perceived as presenting
China unfavorably. Subsequently in 2014, pro-democracy
news outlets in Hong Kong were targeted during the
Umbrella Movement protests. TAG-28’s Winnti campaign
targeting BCCL is the latest in a long line of targeted
intrusions against international media outlets.

Key Judgments
• TAG-28 highly likely targeted UIDAI due to
its ownership of the Aadhaar database. Bulk
personally identifiable information (PII) data sets
are valuable to state-sponsored threat actors.
Likely uses of such data include, but are not
limited to, identifying high-value targets such as
government officials, enabling social engineering
attacks, or enriching other data sources.
• Given the reach of The Times Group publications
and their consistent reporting on the “India
China war”, TAG-28’s targeting of BCCL is likely
motivated by wanting access to journalists and
their sources as well as pre-publication content
of potentially damaging articles focusing on
China or its leadership.
• It is less likely that TAG-28 would gain access
to media entities to interfere with publishing
platforms by changing or disrupting articles
supporting Chinese information operations.

Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group or campaign,
such as RedFoxtrot, typically when analysts have data corresponding
to at least 3 points on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with
at least medium confidence. We will occasionally report on significant
activity using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-28,
where the activity is new and significant but doesn’t map to existing
groupings and hasn’t yet graduated or merged into an established
activity group.

• As of early August 2021, Recorded Future
data shows a 261% increase in the number
of suspected state-sponsored Chinese cyber
operations targeting Indian organizations and
companies already in 2021 compared to 2020.
This follows an increase of 120% between
2019 and 2020, demonstrating China’s growing
strategic interest in India over the past few years.

Threat Analysis
Since early 2020, we have observed a large increase in
suspected targeted intrusion activity against Indian organizations
from Chinese state-sponsored groups, as illustrated through
Insikt Group reporting on RedEcho, RedFoxtrot, TAG-26 2, and
TAG-27 3.
We used a combination of adversary command and control
(C2) detection techniques and Recorded Future Network Traffic
Analysis (NTA) data to identify patterns of suspicious network
traffic between 2 Winnti malware C2 servers and infrastructure
registered to BCCL.

Targeting of Bennett Coleman And Co Ltd

The identified targeted infrastructure is likely operated by
BCCL for the following reasons:
• 2 of the targeted IPs, 103.220.14[.]5 and 103.220.14[.]114,
are advertised by autonomous system (AS) AS135245,
registered to Bennett Coleman And Co Ltd.
• Multiple BCCL domain names are associated with 2 of the
targeted IPs (103.220.14[.]5 and 14.141.124[.]3).
• Targeted IP 103.220.14[.]5 serves an SSL certificate for
BCCL domain *.timesnetwork[.]in.
• A CheckPoint firewall device using IP 103.220.14[.]5
on TCP port 264 returns the device hostname TIMESTRADEHOUSE-SM.timesgroup[.]com.
• A likely DNS resolver using IP 14.141.124[.]3 on UDP port
53 returns the hostname MDC-LLB-F5-01.timesgroup[.]
com.

Between February and August 2021, Insikt Group identified
4 IPs assigned to BCCL in sustained and substantial network
communications with 2 Winnti C2 servers (185.161.209[.]87
and IP 86.107.197[.]182) and a third probable Cobalt Strike

Between January 4 and February 25, 2021, the domain ns1.

During this period, an NS record for this domain pointed at
date.samuelblog[.]info, which subsequently resolved to 2 IPs,
2.56.213[.]86 and 178.157.91[.]144, both hosted with MVPS Ltd.
Using Passive DNS data, we found several suspicious DNS A
record queries for variants of the subdomain api.[data resembling
hexadecimal notation].ns1.samuelblog[.]info. Where the hex data
was longer than 24 characters, the data was split into runs of 56
characters separated by a period. Further research highlighted
several other domains displaying a similar pattern (api.[hex
data].ns1.); the majority of IPs resolved by these domains had
triggered Cobalt Strike C2 server detections in the Recorded
Future Platform. Further to this point, a tutorial video created by
Raphael Mudge, the creator of Cobalt Strike, shows DNS beacon
traffic matching the pattern observed above. Given these factors,
we determined the suspicious DNS traffic for samuelblog[.]info
was likely a result of its use as a Cobalt Strike C2.

Adversary
Based on our visibility, Insikt Group strongly believes TAG-28
is a Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tasked with
gathering intelligence on Indian targets. Our attribution to China
is predicated on their use of Winnti malware, which is exclusively
shared among several Chinese state-sponsored activity groups,
and their targeting of at least 3 distinct Indian organizations in this
campaign. As we continue to track TAG-28’s operational activity,
we will gather additional referential data points that will allow us
to build on our current understanding of their capabilities and
objectives and highlight overlaps with existing activity groups or
graduate TAG-28 to a full-fledged “Red” group like RedEcho or
RedFoxtrot. Additional data points, such as persona handles and
further upstream attacker infrastructure, would support actor
attribution efforts.

Outlook

Mitigations

This research highlights China’s continued strategic and
tactical interest in India-based organizations, both in the
private and public sectors. The 2020 border skirmishes and the
subsequent economic sanctions levied by the Indian government
banning Chinese mobile applications from the Indian market have
resulted in increased tensions between the 2 nations. Gaining
access and insight into Indian government departments and
organizations will therefore likely remain of paramount interest
to Chinese state-sponsored actors for the foreseeable future,
as cyber operations play a key role in gathering intelligence on
military technology or national security matters, in addition to
political and foreign relation developments.

Conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate
activity associated with TAG-28 activity.

While we cannot confirm the intent behind the observed
intrusions, an Indian media entity with broad reach across the
Indian population and the Aadhar system both present valuable
targets for surveillance, espionage, or information operations.
Although several China-based groups have migrated over to
using Shadowpad and other relatively new malware families, this
campaign highlights that established tooling such as Winnti and
offensive security tools (OST) like Cobalt Strike still prove highly
effective for China-nexus threat groups to conduct targeted
intrusions.

• Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS),
intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network
defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon
review, consider blocking connection attempts to and
from — external IP addresses and domains associated
with TAG-28. Clients can view a list of these in the
appendix of the clients-only version of this report.
• Clients can use Recorded Future Hunting Packages to
hunt and detect malware families used by TAG-28.
• We proactively detect and log malicious server
configurations in our Command and Control Security
Control Feed. The C2 list includes malware and
tools used by TAG-28 and Chinese state-sponsored
threat activity groups, such as Winnti, PlugX, and
AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE. Recorded Future clients should
alert on and block these C2 servers to allow for detection
and remediation of active intrusions.
• Recorded Future Threat Intelligence, Third-Party
Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence module users can
monitor real-time output from NTA and Malware Analysis
analytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity
involving your organization or key vendors and partners.
• Ensure operating systems and software are up to
date with the latest patches to protect against known
vulnerabilities.

CAPABILITY

VICTIM

Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group
or campaign, such as RedFoxtrot, when analysts typically
have data corresponding to at least three points on the
Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium
confidence. We will occasionally report on significant activity
using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-21
where the activity is new and significant but doesn't map
to existing groupings and hasn't yet graduated or merged
into an established activity group. We tie this to a threat
actor only when we can point to a handle, persona, person,
or organization responsible. We will write about the activity
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary
data. We use the most widely used or recognized name for a
particular group when the public body of empirical evidence
is clear the activity corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group uses a simple color and phonetic alphabet
naming convention for new nation-state threat actor groups
or campaigns. The color generally corresponds to that
nation’s flag colors, with more color/nation pairings to be
added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups
associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt
Group uses a naming convention corresponding to the
Greek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity
connected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate
country color, and where that group may be tied to a specific
government organization, tie it to that entity specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming
newly identified malware.
