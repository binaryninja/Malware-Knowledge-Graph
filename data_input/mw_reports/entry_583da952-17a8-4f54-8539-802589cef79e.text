RISKS TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT USE CLOUD SERVICES
Cloud services offer a number of benefits such as scalability, high availability, and decreased ownership cost. As a result, owners and operators in several
critical infrastructure sectors such as Communications, Energy, Financial Services, Information Technology, and Transportation Services have migrated
in-house computing resources to cloud infrastructures. However, cloud service environments still possess many of the same potential vulnerabilities associated
with internally hosted environments, as well as additional exploits to virtual systems or networks. Owners and operators of critical infrastructure need to fully
understand the risk environment as they address current cloud services and consider additional migration.

Key Findings
Although cloud services and physical information technology infrastructures are vulnerable to some common attack vectors, such as Denial of Service
attacks, cloud services are also potentially vulnerable to a number of unique attack vectors such as Hyperjacking. When a vulnerability is exploited, cloud
service providers are often reluctant to provide incident details except what is explicitly identified in the Service Level Agreement, making incident response
difficult at times.

Sample of Threats to Cloud Services

ACCESS
DENIED

Brute Force

Data Leakage

Denial of Service

DOMØ Escalation

A malicious actor attempting a large
number of possible keywords or password
combinations to gain unauthorized
access to a system or file.

The accidental or intentional releasing of
information outside its intended audience.

An attack preventing legitimate users
from accessing information on their
computer and its network connection, or
from a Websites’ computers and network.

A malicious actor breaking out of the
virtual environment to gain elevated access
to resources that are normally
protected from the user.

Hyperjacking

Phishing

RAM Scraping

Virtual Machine Escape

The successful compromise of the Hypervisor
(software that manages virtual machines on
a physical system) by a malicious actor, thus
allowing the malicious actor to gain control
of the underlying virtual machines managed
by the hypervisor.

A social engineering technique soliciting
personal information from unsuspecting
users. Phishing emails are crafted to appear
as if they have been sent from a legitimate
organization or known individual.

A type of malware designed for monitoring
and extracting data from a system during
data processing while it is unencrypted.

The act of escaping a virtual machine (a
virtual system or application that is running
inside a physical system) and interacting
directly with the virtual machine’s
hosting environment.

Outlook
▪ More rigorous security standards and development of “best practices”
are necessary to assist critical infrastructure providers in understanding
and managing risks to cloud-based services.
▪ Government and industry information technology owners and
operators should consider the risks and fully vet cloud service providers
before adopting or expanding current cloud-based services.
