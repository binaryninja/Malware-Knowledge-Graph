Introduction & background
In this report, NVISO CTI describes the cyber threat landscape of Ukraine and by extension
the current situation. Understanding the threat landscape of a country, however, requires an
understanding of its geography first and foremost.

1/12

Figure 1 – Map of Ukraine and bordering countries
Ukraine, bordered by Russia as well as Belarus has seen its share of hostile intelligence
operations and near declarations of war. The annexation of Crimea, a peninsula that was
officially recognized as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia early 2014: this was one of
the first and larger “turning points” in modern history.
More recently, in 2018, Russia took it one step further after several years of absorbing
Crimea as part of Russia, by installing a border fence to separate Crimea from Ukraine.[1]
In 2020, during several Belarusian protests targeted at Belarus’ current president
Lukashenko, Ukraine recalled its ambassador to assess the prospects, or lack thereof,
regarding their bilateral relationship.[2] Tensions increased further, and in 2021, Ukraine
joined the European Union (EU) in imposing sanctions on Belarusian officials.[3]
In 2022, this tension materialized by Russia actively performing military operations on
Ukraine’s border, and in February, the bombardment of several strategic sites in Ukraine.[4]

Historical Cyber Attacks
As mentioned, to understand a country, one needs to understand its geography and
geopolitical strategy. A remarkable initiative from Ukraine is their intent on joining NATO as
well as becoming an official member of the EU. These initiatives are likely the trigger for the
recent turmoil, in December 2021, where Russia became openly bold, more aggressive and
2/12

with ultimate goal as explained by Putin: to unify or absorb Ukraine back into Russia. In that
same month, Putin presented to the United States and NATO a list of security demands,
including Ukraine not ever joining NATO.[5] The intent of Putin is, as always, likely to have
multiple dimensions.
This report will describe further history of cyber-attacks on Ukraine, a timeline of current
relevant events in the cyberspace, and finally some recommendations to ensure protection in
case of “cyberwar spillover” as was in the case of NotPetya in 2017.
As mentioned in the introduction, Ukraine has seen its fair share of targeted cyber-attacks.
The table below captures significant Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns / attacks

Table 1 – Key historic attacks
Other attacks have taken place, both cyber-espionage and cyber-criminal, but the threat
group “Black Energy” is by far the most prolific in targeting Ukrainian businesses and
governmental institutions.

3/12

Black Energy and its successors and sub-units are attributed to Russia’s Intelligence
Directorate or GRU (now known as the “Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of
the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation”). The GRU is Russia’s largest foreign
intelligence agency and has therefore access to a vast number of resources, capabilities,
and certain freedom to execute more risky intelligence operations. Note that APT28, also
known as Sofacy and “Fancy Bear” is also part of the GRU but resides in a different unit.[6]
Specifically looking at the attacks targeting Ukraine in 2022, a timeline can be observed
below:

Figure 2 – Ukraine 2022 timeline
Highlighted in blue on the timeline, are suspected attack campaigns by nation states, likely
either Russia or Belarus. Highlighted in green are suspected attack campaigns by
cybercriminal actors in favor of Russia.
Highlighted in red on the timeline, is an intelligence counteraction by Ukraine’s Security
Service, known as the SSU or SBU. The SSU can be seen as Ukraine’s main government
agency protecting national interests, but also has a focus on counterintelligence operations.
On February 8th 2022, the SSU shut down a Russian “trolling farm” that had as sole intent to
distributed “fake news” to spread panic. The bots also published false information about
bomb threats at various facilities.[7]
NVISO CTI assesses with moderate confidence Russia and Belarus will continue destructive
or espionage operations on Ukraine’s infrastructure and those who support Ukraine whether
it be logistically, operationally, or otherwise publicly.
As of yet, spillover of these operations has not been observed in Belgium by organizations
such as the Centre for Cyber security Belgium (CCB).[8] The UK’s National Cyber Security
Centre (NCSC) in turn advices “organizations to act following Russia’s attack on Ukraine”
and provides further guidance.[9]

Key historical operations
4/12

In a quick overview of the aforementioned pre-2022 attacks, the following are some of the
key elements that contributed to their success, and which are important to take into account
when building a detection strategy:
The attack on the Ukrainian power grid was prefaced with a phishing attack against a
number of energy distribution companies. The phishing email contained a Word
document that, when Macros were enabled, dropped the Black Energy malware to
disk. Using this malware the adversaries obtained credentials to access VPN and
remote support systems that allowed them to open circuit breakers remotely. In order to
prevent the operators from closing the circuit breakers remotely again, a wiper was
deployed on the operator machines.
NotPetya was initially deployed via a supply chain attack on Linkos Group. The
NotPetya ransomware caused worldwide damages due to its highly effective spreading
mechanism combining the EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerability, credential dumping
from infected systems and PsExec for lateral movement.
GreyEnergy and its accompanying toolset was typically prefaced with a phishing
attack, containing malicious documents that would deploy “GreyEnergy mini”, a firststage backdoor. A second point of entry was via vulnerable public-facing web services
that are connected to the organization’s internal network. The attacker’s toolset also
contained Nmap and Mimikatz for discovery and lateral movement.
VPNFilter is a multi-stage, modular platform with versatile capabilities to perform a
wide range of operations, primarily espionage but also destructive attacks. The
malware installs itself on network devices such as routers and NAS, and can only be
completely removed with a full reinstallation. Its current preface or infection vector is
unknown, but it is assumed they target vulnerabilities in these network devices as an
initial entrypoint. VPNFilter was a broad-targeting malware and campaign, but was
responsible for multiple large-scale attacks that targeted devices in Ukraine.
Cyclops Blink is the “replacement framework” of VPNFilter and has been active since
at least June 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. Just like VPNFilter,
Cyclops Blink is broad-targeting, but might be targeting devices in Ukraine specifically.
As opposed to VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink is only known to target WatchGuard network
devices at this point in time. Its preface is WatchGuard devices that expose the remote
management interface to the internet / external access.

Current Cyber Attacks (2022)
WhisperGate
Starting on January 13th, 2022, several Ukrainian organizations were hit with a destructive
malware now known as WhisperGate. The malware was designed to wipe the Master Boot
Record, MBR, and proceed to corrupt the files on disk, destroying all traces of the data.

5/12

Initial execution of the first stage was completed using the Python tool Impacket, this being
widely used for lateral movement and execution. Initial access to run Impacket is believed to
have occurred via insecure remote access channels and using stolen/harvested credentials.
Once the MBR is wiped, a fake ransom screen is displayed. This is just to distract while the
third stage is downloaded from a Discord link. Then all data is overwritten on disk.

Massive web defacements
Between the 13th and 14th of January, a coordinated web defacement on several
governmental institutions of Ukraine took place – all websites and their content were wiped
and replaced with a statement[10]:
Ukrainian! All your personal data has been sent to a public network. All data on your
computer is destroyed and cannot be recovered. All information about you stab (public, fairy
tale and wait for the worst. It is for you for your past, the future and the future. For Volhynia,
OUN UPA, Galicia, Poland and historical areas.[10]
The SSU assesses the attack happened via a vulnerable Content Management System
(CMS), and that “in total more than 70 state websites were attacked, 10 of which were
subjected to unauthorized interference”.[11]

DDOS attacks on organizations
On February 15th, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) tweeted[11] that “The MOU website
probably suffered a DDoS attack: an excessive number of requests per second was
recorded.
Technical works on restoration of regular functioning are carried out.”
The attack was carried out on the MoD itself and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but also on
two national banks, which had as result that internet banking was not available for several
hours.

DDoS attacks & the “HermeticBunch”
On February 23rd, there were two newly reported cyber events: DDoS attacks and an attack
campaign we could name “HermeticBunch”.
NetBlock, an internet observatory, noted the DDoS attacks on February 23rd around 4pm
CET. The attacks were impacting the websites of Ukraine’s MoD, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MoFA) and other governmental institutions.[12]
ESET initially reported[13] detecting a new wiper malware used in Ukraine. Their telemetry
indicated the malware was installed on several hundreds of machines with first instances
discovered around 4pm CET. Symantec posted an analysis[14] the next day corroborating
6/12

ESET’s findings, and providing more insight into the attack: ransomware was initially
deployed, as a smokescreen, to hide the data-wiping malware that was effectively used to
launch attacks against Ukrainian organizations.
ESET reported on March 1st [15] that multiple Ukrainian organizations were targeted by an
attack campaign comprising:
HermeticWiper, a data-wiping malware;
HermeticWizard, spreads HermeticWiper over the network (using WMI & SMB);
HermeticRansom: likely a ransomware smokescreen for HermeticWiper.
These components indicate an organized attack campaign with as main purpose destruction
of data. While the spreader malware, HermeticWizard, is worrisome, it can be blocked by
implementing the advice from the Recommendations section below.
Note that AVAST Threat Labs has created a decrypter for files encrypted with
HermeticRansom. [17]

IsaacWiper
IsaacWiper was first detected by ESET on February 24th [18], and was leveraged again for
destructive attacks against the Ukrainian government. The wiper is less sophisticated than
HermeticWiper, but not less effective.

DanaBot
DanaBot is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform where threat actors (“affiliates”) can
purchase access to the underlying DanaBot platform. Zscaler reported on March 2nd [19] to
have identified a threat actor targeting Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) using DanaBot’s
download and execute module.

Fake AV Update leading to Cobalt Strike
Phishing emails impersonating the Ukrainian government were seen during a campaign to
deliver Cobalt Strike beacons and Go backdoors on the 12th of March. Reported by the
Ukraine CERT (CERT-UA) [20], the emails were themed as “critical security updates” and
contained links to download a fake AV update package. The 60 MB file was actually a
downloader which then connected to a Discord CDN to download a file called one.exe. This
being a Cobalt Strike beacon. It also downloads a Go dropper that executes and pulls down
two more Go payloads, GraphSteel and GrimPlant. Both of these being backdoors.

CaddyWiper

7/12

CaddyWiper was discovered by ESET on March 14th [21] and it is the 4th data wiping
malware to be used against Ukraine. It was deployed in the attacks via GPO, this showing
that the threat actor already had a major foothold in the environment. It also has functions to
cause it to not wipe Domain Controllers, this being the foothold the attackers would lose if
destroyed.

Deepfake video
On 16 Mar 2022, Facebook removed a deepfake video of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy
asking Ukrainian troops to surrender. The video initially appeared on the compromised
website of news channel, Ukraine 24, before it was spread to other compromised websites,
such as Segodnya. In response, Zelenskyy published a video of his own, asking Russian
troops to surrender instead. [22]

Industroyer2
On 12 Apr 2022, Eset reported on Industroyer2. ESET researchers collaborated with CERTUA to analyze the attack against an Ukrainian energy company. The destructive actions were
scheduled for 2022-04-08 but artifacts suggest that the attack had been planned for at least
two weeks
The attack used ICS-capable malware and regular disk wipers for Windows, Linux and
Solaris operating systems. In addition to Industroyer2, Sandworm used several destructive
malware families including CaddyWiper, ORCSHRED, SOLOSHRED and AWFULSHRED.
Eset had first discovered CaddyWiper on 2022-03-14 when it was used against a Ukrainian
bank (see also above).[23]

Note on scammers
Now that a lot of organizations are offering aid to Ukraine, it’s more than ever important to
validate the source of the aid offering. This can translate into either:
Scammers pretending to be humanitarian or aid organizations;
Scammers pretending to be law enforcement or others offering direct help to Ukrainian
citizens.
It’s highly recommended to always perform proper vetting of those offering aid, asking for aid
or otherwise request for compensation. Unfortunately, even in these times, scammers will try
to take advantage to fill their pockets. As a side note, CERT-UA had also reported on
scammers impersonating the CIA.[24]

Recommendations
Based on the collective knowledge on adversary groups acting in the interests of the Russian
state and the current ongoing events, it is important for organizations to use this momentum
to implement a number of critical defenses and harden their overall environment.
8/12

Each organization should review their own threat model with regards to the potential threats
facing them, however, the below is a good overview to improve your security posture against
a variety of (destructive) attacks.

Your external exposure
It is advised to perform a periodic assessment on your external perimeter to identify what
systems and services are exposed to the internet. Given the cloud first approach many
organizations are taking, it has become less straight forward of identifying what services your
organization is exposing to the internet, however, attack surface monitoring solutions can
provide an answer to that by looking beyond the scope of your organization IP range.
For all identified services exposed to the internet, ensure:
Validate these are actually required to be exposed to the internet;
They are up to date with the latest security patches.
For all services for which authentication is required (e.g. VPN solutions, access to your client
portal, etc.) it is strongly advised to enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA).

Abuse of (privileged) accounts
Once inside your network, threat actors are very frequently seen going after privileged
accounts (can be local admin accounts or privileged domain accounts).
In terms of local admin accounts, it is important to ensure these accounts have strong
passwords assigned to them, and that no password re-use is performed across different
hosts. Each local administrator account as such should have a unique strong password
assigned to it. Various tools exist that can support in the automated configuration of these
unique passwords for each of these accounts. A good example that can be used is
Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS).
For privileged domain accounts (e.g. a specific server administrator, the domain
administrator or the accounts that have access to your security tooling such as EDR’s), it is
strongly advised to implement MFA.

Lateral Movement
Once the adversary has obtained access into the environment, they’ll move laterally to
eventually gain access to the critical assets of the organization. The following are a number
of key recommendations to help in the prevention of successful lateral movement:
Implement network segmentation and restrict the communication flows between
segments only to the ones required for business reasons;

9/12

Configure host-based firewalls to restrict inbound connections (depending on your
business, a few questions to ask could be: should I allow inbound SMB on my
workstations, should an inbound RDP connection be possible from another
workstation, etc.)
Harden RDP configuration by:
Denying server or Domain Administrator accounts from authenticating to
workstations;
Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA);
Where possible, use Remote Credential Guard or Restricted Admin.
In addition to the implementation of key hardening principles, the lateral movement phase of
an attack is also an opportunity in which adversaries can be detected. Monitoring should be
performed on workstation-to-workstation traffic and authentications, usage of RDP and WMI,
as well as commonly used lateral movement tools such as PsExec, WinRM and PS
Remoting.
Mandiant has additionally provided guidance on protecting against destructive attacks [20]
(PDF).

Critical Assets
In several cases, the adversaries have been observed conducting destructive attacks. As a
proactive measure, ensure offline backups of your critical assets (such as your Domain
Controllers) are created regularly. A frequent overlooked aspect of a backup strategy is the
restore tests. On a frequent basis, it should be verified that the backup can effectively be
restored to a known good state.
On a final note, given that the majority of systems are virtualized these days, it’s important to
ensure the access to your back-end virtualization environment is properly segmented and
secured.

Phishing Prevention
A number of the observed attacks that Russia linked threat actors have executed were
initiated via a phishing campaign with the goal of stealing user credentials or executing
malware on the systems. As such, it is important to verify the hardening settings of your mail
infrastructure. Some key elements to take into account are:
Enable MFA on all mailboxes;
Disable legacy protocols that do not understand MFA and as such would allow an
adversary to bypass this security control;
Perform sandbox execution of all attachments received via mail;
Enable safe links (various mail security provides provide this option) to have the URL
checked for phishing markers once the user clicks.

10/12

Additionally, it is frequently observed that the adversaries are attempting to have a user
enable Macros in the malicious office documents they send. It is advised to review if all users
within your environment use Office Macros and whether or not these can be disabled. If
Macros are used for business reasons, consider only allowing signed Macros.

DDOS Mitigations
Depending on your organization’s risk profile, there is the potential threat of a DDoS attack,
especially following sanctions imposed on Russia in specific sectors. It is advised to
investigate and implement DDoS mitigations on critical public-facing assets. Noteworthy is
Google’s Project Shield [19], which is “a free service that defends news, human rights and
election monitoring sites from DDoS attacks”. Google has recently expanded protection for
Ukraine, and is already protecting more than 150 websites hosted in Ukraine.

Crisis & Incident Management
Tabletop exercises are a great way of measuring the crisis & incident management
processes & procedures you currently have, and to identify any potential gaps that may be
uncovered during a tabletop. Moreover, tabletops are cross-functional and can be used for
both leadership, as well as anyone working with incidents on a day to day basis. The results
of a tabletop exercise can ultimately be used as a platform to improve the current way of
working, or to invest in new resources should there be a need.
