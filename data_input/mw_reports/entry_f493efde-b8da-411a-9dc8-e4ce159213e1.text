A Persistent Campaign Targeting CIS Countries
with SOCKSBOT
July 26, 2018

SUMMARY
A number of security vendors reported a series of cyber-attacks involving the use of a
malware family called SOCKSBOT and claimed to be associated with CANDLEFISH (a.k.a.
Patchwork, Dropping Elephant). However, as disclosed in this report, research by
iDefense analysts shows that SOCKSBOT was in fact used by a threat group in an 18month-long campaign dubbed Goldfin, spoofing financial institutions in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries since as early as February 2017 to
as recently as May 2018. Based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
observed in this campaign, iDefense assesses with moderate confidence that the
reported campaign is unlikely to be associated with CANDLEFISH.
In addition, iDefense analysts have identified infrastructure overlap and the shared use of
a PowerShell obfuscation technique with FIN7. Although these observations are not
enough to attribute the Goldfin campaign to FIN7, iDefense assesses these to be
interesting and noteworthy observations that further highlights the complex
relationships that exist behind-the-scene in organized cyber crime.

HOW TO USE THIS REPORT
INTENDED AUDIENCE
iDefense is providing information about the reported campaigns to the general iDefense
customer base, with this report being intended for security operations center (SOC)
analysts and engineers. Management and executive leadership may also want to use this
information.

HOW TO USE THIS INTELLIGENCE
iDefense is providing this information so that customers are aware of the modus
operandi of a highly active threat group that is targeting financial institutions for financial
gain. SOC analysts and engineers can use this IA's detailed information pertaining to the
workings of a malware family and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to contain or mitigate
the discussed threat through monitoring or blocking. SOC analysts can use the
information provided in the Analysis and Mitigation sections of this IA for hunting
activities for systems that may have already been compromised. Analysts and security
engineers can use the IoCs by adding them to hunting lists on endpoint detection and
response (EDR) solutions as well as network- and host-based blacklists to detect and
deny malware implantation and command-and-control (C2) communication.
Intelligence analysts may want to use the information provided in this IA to better inform
their own analyses. The provided information can also help inform ongoing intelligence

analyses and forensic investigations, particularly for compromise discovery, damage
assessment, and attribution.
Management and executive leadership may use this information to assess the risks
associated with the threat described herein to make operational and policy decisions
accordingly.

HOW THIS INTELLIGENCE HELPS ADDRESS EXISTING OR
POTENTIAL THREATS
Knowledge of the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) should help to
better inform detection and response to attacks by this threat group.

CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS
iDefense analysts came across two spear-phishing campaigns in October 2017 involving
the use of a malware family publicly known as SOCKSBOT. One campaign spoofs the
Halyk Bank (Exhibit 1) and another spoofs the PrivatBank (Exhibit 2):

Exhibit 1: Spear-Phishing Email Spoofing Halyk Bank

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

3

Exhibit 2: Content of a Spear-Phishing E-mail Spoofing PrivatBank Shared on the Public
Forum doneckforum.com
As Exhibits 1 and 2 show, both emails contain an identical message, even down to the
location of the embedded hyperlinks. The only differences are the embedded URLs and
the signature of the email in order to reflect the financial institution the attackers were
spoofing. This information suggests some sort of phishing kit was likely used to generate
the phishing emails.
An approximate translation of the e-mail spoofing Halyk Bank is as follows:
Subject: Notification of opening an account (Halyk Bank of Kazakhs
tan)
Dear customer, an account with the People's Bank of Kazakhstan has
been opened in your name, you can find detailed information in the
attached file.
If you did not receive an envelope with a login and password, then
you need to register to access the Personal Area. In case of loss
of login / password, you can register a new one in the section "Pa
ssword recovery".
If in the process of work you have any questions or problems, plea
se contact the Customer Service Department at the contacts listed
below. Our specialists are always ready to help you.

The embedded malicious hyperlinks used in the respective attacks are as follows:
hxxp://halyk-bank[.]com/dog.zip
hxxp://privatbank-ua[.]com/dog.zip

Subsequent technical analysis of the infection chain involved led iDefense to uncover an
18-month long campaign of spoofing banks in CIS countries, with the most recent
campaign observed on May 28, 2018 spoofing the Idea Bank CJSC:

Exhibit 3: Spear-Phishing Email Spoofing Idea Bank CJSC
The forum member reports that two spear-phishing emails were received: one claiming
to be a notification about opening an account and the other claiming to be a notification
of a loan being taken out. The content of the latter email is approximately translated
below:

Dear client, in your name, a loan was issued to Idea Bank, for mor
e details, see the attached file in which the full name and phone
number of your personal loan expert is indicated, the amount and c
onditions for repaying the loan.
An envelope with a credit agreement was sent to your address. In c
ase you did not receive the envelope, you should contact your pers
onal expert.
In case of loss of the contract, you can restore it at the nearest
branch of the bank or request a duplicate through your personal ex
pert.
For any questions you are interested in, you can contact your pers
onal expert or the Customer Service Department at the contacts lis
ted below. Our specialists are always ready to help you.
Yours faithfully,
Idea Bank CJSC
Phone for calls from abroad: +375 (17) 306-33-14

In the attacks observed, all involved a phishing email with two embedded URLs directing
the user to download a file named dog.zip. Based on the content of the e-mails and the
domain names, the following banks were spoofed in this campaign:
•
•
•

Halyk Bank (Kazakhstan)
PrivatBank (Ukraine)
Idea Bank (Belarus)

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

5

•

Tejara Bank (Iran)

It is also noteworthy that in both phishing kits, there are always two hyperlinks linking to
the same malicious file: one in the body of the message and one at the end of the e-mail
in a link called Договор (which translates to Contract).
The next section details the infection chain that follows the initial download.

INFECTION CHAIN ANALYSIS
The general infection chain observed in this campaign is as shown in Exhibit 4:

Exhibit 4: The Infection Chain Used in the SOCKSBOT Campaign

STAGE 1 - JAVASCRIPT DROPPER
Both links delivered a ZIP archive file named dog.zip:
•

hxxp://halyk-bank[.]com/dog.zip - 211fbf34749df5e717e8b11fecb3f648

•

hxxp://privatbank-ua[.]com/dog.zip - b3fb88a5aa791aea141bf3b4cf045355

Both contain a JavaScript file named dog.js with the MD5
signatures 9a273653364dfb143ff196d826d2bac4 and 21a09cf81f3584a741c7167f622d6c50
, respectively.
The JavaScript file contains heavily obfuscated code as Exhibit 5 shows. The malicious
code is in fact hidden as comments and is dynamically deobfuscated once the script has
been executed.

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

6

Exhibit 5: Obfuscated Code in dog.js
Once deobfuscated (see Exhibit 6), it is clear that the code is designed to do two things:
1. To look for a running anti-virus processes, such as avp.exe (Kaspersky Antivirus).
Note that some variants of the malware also search
for ekrn.exe (ESET), cis.exe (Comodo) and avgnt.exe (Avira).
2. To drop and execute a PowerShell script named setup.ps1. This script is
generated based on Base64 encoded data stored in variables
named dllData and code.
3. Delete setup.ps1

Exhibit 6: Deobfuscated Code in dog.js

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

7

STAGE 2 - POWERSHELL DROPPER WITH EMPIRE
The PowerShell script setup.ps1 used in each attack has the respective MD5
signatures 521c81c62836a233a6e771bc3491300f and 00c38b787eac602ffaed0b9372f2c443
.
The script is designed for the following (see Exhibit 7):
1. Create a PowerShell script
named checkupdate.ps1 in C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ (This path is hardcoded
in the malware). The content of this script is stored in a variable named data and is
Based64 encoded
2. Create a cmdlet that would:
a. move the script checkupdate.ps1 to the home directory for the current
PowerShell install
b. establish persistence by creating a Windows service named Check for
updates, set to "delay-auto" start and execute checkupdate.ps1

3. Use a modified version of the function Invoke-EventVwrBypass from the Empire
Post-exploitation framework to bypass UAC and execute the above cmdlet

Exhibit 7: Deobfuscated Code in setup.ps1
Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

8

STAGE 3 - POWERSHELL REFLECTIVE LOADER
Similarly, checkupdate.ps1 used in each attack has the respective MD5
signatures 54e7f3a1a1a8857e35a45f4eb2a3317d
and 29573b1fa60bce8e04dd2a4d554a7447.
Unsurprisingly, this script also contains obfuscated code. The malicious payload is
compressed, Base64 encoded, and embedded within the script, which is similar to a
technique used in PowerSploit.
However, the observed technique appears to be a variant of PowerSploit as the encoded
payload is further split into a number of chunks that are dynamically loaded into an array
variable named $OArr as shown in Exhibit 8:

Exhibit 8: Obfuscated Code in checkupdate.ps1
The code is in fact a PowerShell reflective loader script with a dynamic-link library (DLL)
binary embedded as Base64-encoded data (Exhibit 9).

STAGE 4 - SOCKSBOT
The specific SOCKSBOT sample analyzed in this report has the following properties:
•
•
•
•

Filename: socksbot.dll
MD5: 90f35fd205556a04d13216c33cb0dbe3
File Size: 17.0 KB (17408 bytes)
Compiled Time Stamp: 2017-10-27 17:46:05

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

10

As mentioned in the last section, the SOCKSBOT implant is typically delivered as a
Base64-encoded string reflectively loaded (via the
?ReflectiveLoader@@YGKPAX@Z exported function) in a newly
started svchost.exe process. As such, the implant exists only in memory and never
touches the disk.
The implant will first verify if any of the mutexes in the following format are present in
order to not run twice:
Global\%snps
Global\%sstp

Exhibit 10 shows an example of a created mutex.

Exhibit 10: Mutex Creation a321c0d8979a05bdnps
The SOCKSBOT implant has the following capabilities:
•
•
•
•
•

Enumerate processes (process list)
Take screenshots
Download, upload, write, and execute files
Create and inject into new processes
Communicate to C2 via sockets

This implant will communicate with the designated C2 server by first creating a buffer
and will, on first execution, communicate to the C2 server that it has successfully
infected a target by using a.php URI that is pseudo-randomly generated. SOCKSBOT
uses the ObtainUserAgentString API to determine the default user-agent of the machine.
An example of a request to the C2 46.166.163[.]243 is shown in Exhibit 11.

Exhibit 11: Traffic to the C2 Server
The C2 server or the operator of the SOCKSBOT implant can then respond with a specific
HTTP status code to perform a set of actions. Exhibit 12 shows this option in the implant.

11

Exhibit 12: C2 Options
The following status codes are supported:
•

200: create and start new socket

•

202: enumerate processes and take screenshot

•

203: perform a set of actions (download, upload, execute)

Exhibit 13 shows an example of possible actions:

Exhibit 13: HTTP Status Code 203 Return Options
The actions that the operator can perform are as follows:
•

Write and execute files

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

12

•
•

Execute PowerShell scripts
Execute a PowerShell script and exit

SOCKSBOT can thus write other PowerShell scripts to the %TEMP% folder and execute
these hidden from the user. This is achieved with the following command:
%s\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypas
s -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -File "%s"

This allows the attacker to upload other obfuscated PowerShell scripts on the machine
and, as such, makes SOCKSBOT a powerful and persistent backdoor.
Altogether, the SOCKSBOT samples observed and analyzed in this report are as follows:
90f35fd205556a04d13216c33cb0dbe3
2a4d16ddad27c6eb60e197b6b07c2df0
14f71d5cb8f15f0a9943b5d709a85b73
92dfd0534b080234f9536371be63e37a
039d9e47e4474bee24785f8ec5307695
55a57741f49d6c887992353bc47846bc

Only three different C2 servers have been observed:
5.8.88[.]64
46.166.163[.]243
5.135.73[.]113

INFECTION CHAIN VARIATIONS
While the described infection chain above is the most common infection chain observed,
iDefense analysts have also observed a number of different variations in related
campaigns:
1. SOCKSBOT Dropper
2. dog.js Obfuscation
3. Random PowerShell Script Names
4. Reflective loading PowerShell Script Obfuscation

VARIATION 1: SOCKSBOT DROPPER
Aside from the PowerShell reflective loader, iDefense analysts have also identified a
dropper executable binary with the following properties that was used to reflectively
load SOCKSBOT into a chosen process (usually svchost.exe):
•
•
•
•

Filename: <random>
MD5: 14f71d5cb8f15f0a9943b5d709a85b73
File Size: 23.6 KB (24200 bytes)
Compiled Time Stamp: 2017-02-01 13:40:14

13

•

Signer: Magnum Travel Club (Serial: 1F 8A 3E 60 EE C1 E3 AA 63 B3 9B DD 26
E1 10 FB)

Note that the binary was signed with a code-signing certificate purportedly from an
organization called Magnum Travel Club.
This dropper will create a copy of itself in C:\Programdata\Logs as a hidden system file
and will then delete the original file. Another copy will be created
in %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup with the same
properties to ensure persistence.
Finally, the dropper will start a new svchost.exe process in a suspended state and
consequently reflectively load (and inject) the SOCKSBOT implant into the process.
An additional Windows service may be created for persistence as well, which is done by
first enumerating existing legitimate services and creating a new service spoofing one of
the services with an almost identical name.
In this case, a new service named Xindows Error Reporting Service was created (see
Exhibit 14).

Exhibit 14: Service Creation
While this dropper does indeed load the SOCKSBOT implant, all other iterations or
campaigns have used scripts, in particular JavaScript and PowerShell, to reflectively load
the SOCKSBOT payload.

VARIATION 2: DOG.JS OBFUSCATION
While most dog.js samples observed were obfuscated as reported in the infection chain
section, there are also versions that were not obfuscated at all or were obfuscated using
a different obfuscation technique such as different character encoding (Exhibit 15):

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

14

Exhibit 15: A Different Obfuscation Technique Used in dog.js
Once executed, this sample (MD5: b01cf8f375bc0aff2cfe3dc1b4c1823c) will deobfuscate
and generate a new file called ~~1.tmp in %appdata%\Futures. The script is deleted after
execution.

VARIATION 3: RANDOM POWERSHELL SCRIPT NAMES
Certain variants of dog.js also have a new function to randomly generate file names for
the second- and third-stage PowerShell scripts:
function makerndps1() {
var text = "";
var possible = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789";
for (var i = 0;
i < 5;
i++) text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.l
ength));
return text + '.ps1';
}

4. REFLECTIVE LOADING POWERSHELL SCRIPT OBFUSCATION
Aside from changes to the dog.js obfuscation, iDefense analysts have also found a
different obfuscation technique used to obscure the code in the reflective loading script
(see Exhibit 16):

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

15

Exhibit 16: Different Obfuscation Technique Used in the Reflective Loading PowerShell
Script
The sample concerned has the MD5 signature c38b06f871d2268972fa01725b59d7ed. Note
also that the execution command used for persistence is again encoded (see Exhibit 17):

Exhibit 17: Obfuscated Execution Command in Check for update Service Used for
Persistence

ATTRIBUTION
Based on the preference to spoof financial institutions in CIS countries, the network
infrastructure used and the observed targeting, iDefense assesses with moderate
confidence that the reported campaign is unlikely to be associated with CANDLEFISH.
Furthermore, iDefense analysts have identified a number of interesting and noteworthy
overlaps with FIN7:
•
•

Identical WHOIS information used in domains associated with the Goldfin
campaign and FIN7, as well as network hosting overlap
Shared use of a PowerShell obfuscation technique

Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.

16

OVERLAP 1: IDENTICAL WHOIS INFORMATION AND NETWORK
HOSTING OVERLAP
Research shows that the domains privat-bankau[.]com, halyk-bank[.]com, and tejarabank[.]com all have the organization name Goldfin LLC, a near-identical registrant

address (see below), and a @rambler.ru e-mail address used as the registrant e-mail
address.
Registrant Organization: Goldfin LLC
Registrant Street: ul Arbat 5
Registrant City: Moscow
Registrant State/Province: Moscow
Registrant Postal Code: 115343
Registrant Country: RU

This pattern overlaps with two other domains despanabrandfood[.]com and silverdiners[.]com (see Exhibit 18) - that iDefense current
assesses with low confidence are likely associated with FIN7 due to the following:
1. Spoofing restaurant chains Despaña Brand Foods (legitimate
domain despanabrandfoods.com) and Silver Diner (legitimate
domain silverdiners.com), a known technique associated with FIN7. The website
despanabrandfood[.]com remains indexed by Google (see Exhibit 19)
2. Previously resolved to the IP address 192.99.14[.]211, which was reported by
Trustwave and tr1dx as associated with FIN7 towards late 2016 and early 2017. In
addition, like many domains associated with FIN7 as well as the Carbanak group,
many of the domains used in the Goldfin campaign were also parked at
31.41.41[.]41 which is associated with CIS Hosting. However, iDefense analysts
are aware both hosts are likely to be shared/parking hosts hence the association
with FIN7 based on this overlap is of low confidence.

infrastructure associated with FIN7:

Campaign and FIN7

18

OVERLAP 2: SHARED USE OF A POWERSHELL OBFUSCATION
TECHNIQUE
As mentioned in the infection chain analysis, the code embedded within the third-stage
PowerShell script checkupdate.ps1 is obfuscated using a technique similar to that of
PowerSploit. However, the technique used appears to be a niche variant as the
embedded payload is further split into chunks and dynamically added to an array variable
named $OArr.
Interestingly, iDefense analysts have previously observed this obfuscation used in a
PowerShell component (MD5: 87327b4045b9d004697aec7e7a4b9ba8) that was dropped by
a HALFBAKED sample (MD5: 31fcf8a4ec7a4c693eda9336321cf401) back in August 2017.
HALFBAKED is a malware family associated with FIN7.

Exhibit 21: Similar PowerShell Obfuscation Technique Used between the Goldfin
Campaign and FIN7
While the above overlapping features are not strong enough to be used to conclude that
the Goldfin campaign is associated with FIN7, iDefense analysts believe they are
significant and noteworthy and may well add to new evidence that may come to light in
the future as research continues. They also highlight the complex hidden relationships
that exist behind-the-scenes in organized cyber crime.

MITIGATION
To effectively defend against the threats described in this report, iDefense recommends
blocking the following access URIs and IP address:
blopsadmvdrl[.]com
bipovnerlvd[.]com
kiprovolswe[.]com
kiprovol[.]com
voievnenibrinw[.]com

It will also be useful for incident response and threat-hunting purposes to verify the
existence of any of the following artefacts:
•

A randomly named file
in C:\Programdata\Logs or %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup

•

Randomly named PowerShell or JavaScript files in %temp%

•

A file named dog.zip and dog.js

•

•

A file named ~~1.tmp in %appdata%\Futures
A service name with significant spelling errors
A service named Check for updates

•

A PowerShell script named checkupdate.ps1 in default PowerShell installation
directory
A svchost.exe process that does not have wininit.exe as parent process

•

It will also be useful to verify the existence of any of the following hashes on the host:
