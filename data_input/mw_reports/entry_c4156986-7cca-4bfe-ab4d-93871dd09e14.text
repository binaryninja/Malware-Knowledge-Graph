2 | Cyber Threats 2019: A Year in Retrospect | PwC

Introduction
In 2019, the cyber threat landscape became increasingly complex to navigate: with the proliferation
of financially motivated cyber activity, intelligence operations navigating the currents of powerful
interests and international politics, and information operations attempting to manipulate the narrative.
2018 marked a year of audacity,
with nation states becoming
more brazen in their attacks and
intelligence agencies around the
world calling out other governments’
cyber activity. While in 2019 PwC
did not observe a radical shift
in cyber activity, there was a
continuation of the same brazenness
and even an uptick in operational
tempo from several threat actors,
including financially motivated and
espionage-focused threat actors.
Several trends observed in 2018
continued to dominate the landscape
throughout 2019, with business email
compromise (BEC) attacks growing
ever more sophisticated, threat
actors continuing to manipulate
living-off-the-land techniques to
disguise activity, and an overall
overt alignment between the cyber
threat landscape, the geopolitical
landscape, and real-world events.

2019 also saw the continued
proliferation of ransomware, and
further criminal threat actors diversify
their operations to incorporate
ransomware. In 2019, cyber criminal
activity remained an extremely
significant threat to commercial
organisations. While PwC saw new
threat actors rise to prominence in
the cyber criminal space, overall,
the cyber criminal market effectively
consolidated around large,
established players that maintained,
managed, and updated some of the
largest cyber criminal operations.
This report considers the incumbent
leaders on the cyber crime scene,
as well as the new players and
diversification of revenue.
In terms of sabotage attacks, the
end of 2019 saw a new form of
wiper named ZeroCleare – with
links to Shamoon malware –
target organisations in the Middle
East. Throughout 2019, DDoS

attacks remained a steady trend
in the background of other cyber
operations. Election interference
via information operations is an
increasingly well-documented
phenomena, and 2019 saw the same
information operation principles used
for other nefarious activities.
This report analyses the overarching
and thematic trends from 2019,
including mapping tools, techniques,
and procedures to the cyber-attack
landscape. Our analysis is based on
our in-house intelligence datasets on
cyber attacks and targeting from a
variety of threat actors, intelligence
gleaned from our incident response
engagements around the world, our
Managed Cyber Defence service, as
well as publicly available information
from the cyber security community.
This report intends to highlight the
most prolific trends PwC observed
throughout 2019 and explore their
wider impact.

Continued trends from 2018
Several trends observed in 2018 continued to dominate the landscape throughout 2019.

Increasing sophistication of
business email compromise attacks
Our 2018: A Year in Retrospect report
illustrated the rising trend of BEC attacks,
where a threat actor either hijacks or
closely imitates (‘spoofs’) a legitimate
email account in order to more effectively
socially engineer individuals. The targeted
individuals receive spear-phishing emails
from the attacker, often masquerading as
someone known to the target. In 2019,
BEC attacks remained prevalent across
all industry sectors and business sizes,
and there was a rise in targeted attacks
with more sophisticated social
engineering as a result of extensive
preparatory reconnaissance. This
highlights the importance of security
awareness training for employees, as
detection of this type of scam typically
relies on employees being able to identify
suspicious emails and being empowered
to verbally query the (usually internal)
sender. In one case investigated by the
PwC Incident Response team, the threat
actor created a sophisticated web of
impersonated individuals at every level in
the email chain, and used phone calls to
reiterate claims from the phishing emails.

From useful to dangerous: living-off-the-land techniques
Another theme that has endured throughout 2019 is the use of legitimate tools and
processes, often already installed on a victim’s device, to reduce the chance of an
attack being detected. This method is referred to as living-off-the-land – attempting
to hide in plain sight. Fileless persistence techniques or memory-only tools are
common living-off-the-land techniques. Indeed, many threat actors include or
download legitimate tools as part of the infection process; the remote execution tool
PsExec is a legitimate tool that is commonly used in this way.
In September 2019, PwC analysed an unusual form of fileless malware, dubbed
Nodersok, which installs several legitimate tools such as Node.exe to proxy
traffic.1 Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime environment that is not usually
associated with malware and potentially less likely to be detected as a result.

In June 2019, PwC reported on a sophisticated espionage campaign targeting a
police force in the Indian subcontinent which relied on living-off-the-land
techniques to evade detection.2 The threat actor, Orange Chandi (a.k.a.
Sidewinder), masqueraded as a senior superintendent in the police force in a
phishing email that contained a malicious file disguised as a compliance
document. In the chain of events following the malicious document’s execution,
the threat actor took advantage of standard Windows features to achieve its goal,
rather than creating bespoke malware.

Continued geopolitical alignment
Throughout 2018, PwC intelligence
reporting regularly documented a more
overt alignment between the cyber threat
landscape and the geopolitical
landscape. This trend continued in 2019,
with further attacks in response to
sanctions, diplomatic tensions, and
trade deals. This report considers
multiple examples of this parallel, from:
•

Repeated cases of threat actors
incorporating timely real-world events
into crafting convincing lures; to,

•

Pakistan-based and India-based
threat actors engaging in ripostes to
one another’s cyber operations, and
even copying techniques used by
other threat actors; and,

•

Information operations in the lead up
to national elections.

As with 2018, PwC assesses it likely that
the alignment between cyber attacks
and geopolitics will continue to be
prominent through 2020.

Intelligence gathering

Action and reaction
2019 was a tense year for India-Pakistan
relations, with numerous instances of
posturing, heated and inflammatory
rhetoric, and the occasional spill-over
into physical conflict. This volatile set of
circumstances also led to a spate of
tit-for-tat cyber attacks, with threat
actors based in both countries
conducting intelligence-gathering
campaigns amongst the political chaos.
The attacks exploited the state of
heightened alert, weaponising news
pieces into malicious documents to
socially engineer targets.

special status to Kashmir. The
malicious attachment in the email
had the filename ‘India makes
Kashmir Dangerous Place in the
World’.4 Throughout 2019, Orange
Athos continued leveraging its
ability to embed techniques used by
other threat actors in its own
operations, expanding its arsenal
and complicating attribution.
PwC assesses it highly likely that 2020
sees further cyber attacks between
these two nations, and that any
deterioration of affairs would motivate
an escalation in attacks.

In particular, in 2019, PwC observed
Pakistan-based and India-based threat
actors engaging in timely ripostes to one
another’s cyber operations, with cases of
threat actors borrowing and incorporating
their adversaries’ techniques.
•

In late February 2019, Pakistan-based
threat actor Green Havildar (a.k.a.
Gorgon Group) used a lure related to
airstrikes conducted by the
Indian military within Pakistani
airspace, allegedly targeting a
Jaish-e-Mohammad training camp.3
The lure document delivered a
CrimsonRAT payload to victims.

•

Similarly, India-based threat actor
Orange Athos (a.k.a. Patchwork)
used a politicised lure encouraging
Pakistani targets to open a malicious
attachment, in the wake of the Indian
government’s decision to revoke an
article in the constitution providing

Espionage attacks target the
nuclear sector
Nuclear energy continues to be the crux
of much international tension. Following
the US withdrawal from the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018,
Iran announced at multiple times
throughout 2019 that it had resumed its
nuclear enrichment programme – which it
had previously stopped in order to relieve
international sanctions imposed on oil
exports. Throughout the year, the US
were also engaged in sustained talks with
the North Korean government about a
proposed nuclear energy agreement, with
a view to halt or delay North Korea’s
nuclear program in exchange for the
lifting of currently-imposed export
sanctions. Meanwhile, the Indian
subcontinent is also witnessing a race
between the two main nuclear players in
the region, India and Pakistan.
In 2019, PwC observed intense targeting
of the nuclear energy space by multiple
threat actors, with a strong concentration
of activity by Asia-based threat actors. At
the very beginning of 2019, PwC
identified a fake webmail login page
pretending to belong to the Pakistan
Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), and
which looked like an exact copy of the
legitimate PAEC equivalent. The fake
webpage was configured by an IP
address controlled by the India-based
threat actor that PwC tracks internally as
Orange Berserker (a.k.a. Viceroy Tiger).
Around the same time, the Orange
Berserker-controlled IP also set up

domains spoofing the Pakistan Navy
webmail login.5 Later in the year, PwC
also observed a further campaign
delivering a malicious document titled
‘PAEC_Security_Advisory.doc’,6 which
was concerned with the reported
compromise of a large set of Pakistani
social media by ‘our adversaries’. The
malicious document used macros to
deliver a malware family that PwC
internally named RaveRAT, and which
bears some similarities to CrimsonRAT as
well as PeppyRAT.
One of the most notable campaigns
targeting the nuclear sector in 2019
compromised the Kudankulam Nuclear
Power Plant (KKNPP) in Tamil Nadu, a
joint venture between India and Russia.7
PwC analysts were able to independently
verify that the malware assessed to have
infected KKNPP’s networks was a highly
tailored sample of a backdoor known in
open source as DTrack and Preft.8 PwC
assesses that DTrack, and the
customised DTrack sample involved in the
KKNPP incident, are tied to North
Korea-based threat actor Black Artemis,
widely known in open source as Lazarus.
The malware had been configured with
specific knowledge of the KKNPP internal
network, and used a further compromised
host on the network as a traffic proxy,
implying that the threat actor had
compromised and reconnoitered KKNPP
prior to the deployment of the customised
DTrack payload. Analysing the sample,
PwC analysts did not find evidence of
destructive capability in the malware,

rather, it appeared more oriented towards
information theft. This is not the first time
that North Korea-based threat actors had
targeted, and successfully compromised,
nuclear plants or organisations in the
nuclear sector. In 2014, for example,
Black Banshee had breached the Korea
Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP)
Corporation,9 leaking stolen confidential
documents as well as attempting
sabotage wiper attacks against
victim machines.
The targeting of nuclear organisations
that PwC observed in 2019 broadly aligns
with individual states’ national interests
and strategic objectives, it also reflects at
a higher-level the current geopolitical
balances and international relations.
PwC expects the nuclear sector to
continue drawing cyber targeting,
especially by espionage motivated threat
actors, throughout 2020.

In the Python’s coils
Throughout 2019, PwC analysts tracked
sustained activity assessed to be
conducted by the Russia-based
espionage threat actor Blue Python
(a.k.a. Turla or Snake). Blue Python
consistently targeted Central and Eastern
European countries, including Austria,
Czech Republic, Moldova, Ukraine and
Armenia. The threat actor continued to
focus on compromising government
ministries (with special attention on the
Ministries of Foreign Affairs and
Ministries of the Interior) as well as other
government entities and government
organisations, with some targeting of
NGOs involved in business and defence.
The threat actor continues to rely on a
wide toolset consisting of multiple
downloader, dropper, and backdoor
malware families. In 2019, PwC analysts
observed Blue Python adding new
malware to its arsenal, including the
Topinambour downloader,10 but also
continuing to develop existing tools, with
updated variants of the Kazuar backdoor
used to target the Czech Republic.11 In
that instance, the threat actor leveraged
compromised WordPress sites for
command and control infrastructure. In
July 2019, Blue Python compromised the
websites of legitimate organisations in
the Armenian NGO sector to act as
watering holes for further victims. The
compromised websites delivered the
Blue Python implant known as Skipper –
a first-stage profiling tool used to deploy
other, more powerful backdoors to
victims of special interest.

In summer 2019, PwC detected samples
of Skipper used in a multi-stage infection
chain targeting a private sector entity that
deviated from Blue Python’s typical
victimology: an Asian shipbuilding
company, active in the production of
Arctic-capable vessels.12 The downloader
for the sample contained unobfuscated
macros; this is uncharacteristic of Blue
Python’s well-designed decoys and
might indicate that the particular
document chain used in the attack was
still under development at the time it was
deployed. Moreover, analysing the
metadata of the malicious document and
comparing with the date a sample was
uploaded to an online multi-antivirus
scanner indicates that the threat actor
began targeting potential victims less
than a week after creating the malicious
document. The Arctic is a strategically
sensitive region due to its access to
natural resources and the opening up of
transport routes, and the Arctic Shipping
Route has been a crucial element in
cooperation between South Korea and
Russia. In light of this, the targeting of the
Asian shipbuilding company operating in
the Arctic would align with Russian
strategic economic interests and
intelligence requirements.13

keys belonging to an Iran-based threat
actor – which a linked open-source
report indicates is Yellow Maero (a.k.a.
OilRig).14 Blue Python was then able to
deploy malware using Yellow Maero’s
own infrastructure, and to exploit Yellow
Maero’s established access to
compromised victims for its own
intelligence collection purposes against
targets in the Middle East. The NCSC’s
and NSA’s description of this activity
reinforces the assessment of Blue
Python as a highly sophisticated and
well-resourced threat actor, able to
experiment with new tools and even
repurpose complex tools developed by
other foreign actors. PwC assesses it is
likely Blue Python will continue with
sophisticated campaigns going into
2020, with government entities and the
defence sector particularly at risk.

Blue Python continues to conduct
government espionage and intelligence
gathering operations; in October 2019,
the UK National Cyber Security Centre
(NCSC) and the US National Security
Agency (NSA) publicly assessed that
Blue Python gained access to assets
including malware and cryptographic

Timely lures see real-world events mirrored in the cyber world
In 2019, cyber espionage campaigns continued to align, in targeting and aims, with changing
international relations. Mirroring this association in phishing campaigns, threat actors often
sent timely and relevant malicious lure documents to victims in order to infect them. While this
technique is not new, in 2019 PwC observed threat actors frequently stealing official
government documents and using them as infection vectors, or repurposing them shortly after
their publication, along with public news articles on political or economic themes.
Case study – Phishing emails exploit
article hours after its release

Case study – Summits and
anniversaries exploited

Case study – Invitations used to
lure victims

In late October 2019, PwC tracked the
espionage threat actor Red Lich (a.k.a.
Mustang Panda) as it used a lure
document themed around a visit made
to Tibet by the US ambassador for
International Religious Freedom. The
threat actor crafted the malicious
payload by taking material from a news
article published just hours earlier, as
well as pictures from the Central Tibetan
Administration’s website.15 The timeliness
of the lure was likely intended to make
the document appear to be a legitimate
news item, enticing victims to open the
malicious attachment. Red Lich has
used similar types of lure documents, as
well as fake CVs, to compromise victims
since at least 2017.16,17 The threat actor
has historically targeted nongovernmental organisations (NGOs),
pro-democracy activists and minority
rights groups across Asia, as well as
international policy think tanks.

In mid-April 2019, PwC analysts
detected a sample of the NOKKI
backdoor, which is attributed to North
Korea-based espionage threat actor
Black Shoggoth (a.k.a. APT37).18 In that
instance, NOKKI was delivered to targets
via a .exe file masquerading as a PDF
document with the filename ‘Kim, Putin
have high hopes for their 1st one-on-one
meeting.exe’. The executable would
install NOKKI on victim systems while
displaying to the user a benign
Associated Press article about the
Kim-Putin summit of that same month.19

In summer 2019, PwC discovered that
Green Havildar had been targeting
individuals associated with the Indian
military, sending them an invitation to a
formal event allegedly to be held in
November 2019 at the Indian National
Defence College.20 The threat actor highly
tailored the lures to masquerade as the
targets’ wives.

PwC identified another NOKKI sample
created on the same day as the sample
described above. This sample likely
targeted individuals involved in
diplomatic relations between Norway
and South Korea, as the backdoor was
laced with an RSVP for a May 2019
reception in South Korea for the
‘Constitution Day of the Kingdom of
Norway and the 60th anniversary of the
diplomatic relations’.18

Case study – Military conferences high
on White Ioke’s agenda
Espionage threat actor White Ioke (a.k.a.
OceanLotus) timed its phishing
documents around real-world events of
interest to its targets. In April 2019, PwC
observed the threat actor delivering a
malicious document titled ‘Form_
Provisional Agenda of the ASEAN Senior
Officials Preparatory Meeting.doc’.21
Interestingly, an ASEAN Senior Officials’
Meeting was scheduled to take place in
Thailand on 28th May 2019. White Ioke
has used lure documents about military
and ASEAN-themed conferences before,
for example ‘2018 Cambodia Outlook
Conference.doc’. Many of the threat
actor’s lures were written in Vietnamese,
Khmer, or Mandarin, reflecting White
Ioke’s known targeting.

Working the supply chain: a continued focus

Since at least 2017, a significant trend for
sophisticated threat actors has been their
targeting of third parties in order to reach
their customers. Threat actors will mask
backdoors with legitimate digital
certificates, direct malicious traffic
through trusted companies (as
compromised command and control
servers (C2s)), and use established
organisations to spread malware, in order
to gain access to victims and
avoid detection.
In particular, China-based threat actors
had an increased focus on exploiting the
trust and privileged access afforded to
third-party suppliers.
Case study – Compromised
software updates
ASUS Live Update is a utility that is
pre-installed on Asus products, and is
required to provide real-time updates to
core software components such as a
machine’s BIOS. In 2019, it was
discovered that ASUS pushed
compromised software updates for
several months in the latter half of 2018 in
an operation called ShadowHammer.22
Threat actors compromised ASUS and
manipulated Live Update in order to
install a backdoor on victim machines
without end users’ knowledge. Although
it is estimated that the number of
compromised victims may be in the
hundreds of thousands, it is likely that
only a few hundred of these were the
ultimate victims of Operation
ShadowHammer, which is assessed to
be a highly targeted operation despite
its blanket-attack tactic for delivery of
the malware.
Winnti collective exploits the
supply chain
PwC assesses that the users of Winnti
encompasses activity by multiple
China-based threat actors, which

occasionally share infrastructure,
techniques, and implants. Most notably,
these actors are known for having access
to a version of the ‘Winnti backdoor’.
While the threat actors share tools,
techniques, and procedures, they often
operate independently with different
objectives. This could be attributed to a
small number of key developers moving
around threat actors, however, PwC
assesses it likely that they operate under
a digital quartermaster arrangement. The
PwC Threat Intelligence team tracks at
least five China-based clusters as part of
the Winnti collective, although it is
notoriously difficult to distinguish among
threat actors due to their likely use of a
digital quartermaster.
The threat actors PwC tracks as part of
the Winnti collective have also been
linked to multiple supply chain attacks.
Prominent examples include the
compromises of CCleaner and
NetSarang in 2017,23, 24, 25 in which the
threat actor deployed the ShadowPad
backdoor, developed by one of the core
threat actors in the Winnti collective. In
October 2019, open sources reported
that the ShadowPad backdoor had been
updated, and was being used to target
an Asian mobile software and hardware
manufacturer, likely as part of a supply
chain attack.
Since 2011, the Winnti malware family
has been, and continues to be, deployed
in targeted intrusions across a range of
sectors. PwC research from May 2019
identified more than 150 systems
spanning 23 countries and a wide variety
of sectors that had been compromised
by the Winnti malware.26
Victims within the entertainment and
media sector include gaming companies,
which aligns to the earliest known
targeting by a threat actor using the
Winnti backdoor.

DNS hijacking
DNS hijacking involves compromising
DNS infrastructure providers or related
parts of the DNS ecosystem in order to
access further victims. Compromising
DNS infrastructure providers allows
threat actors to modify DNS records and
redirect traffic meant for a legitimate
server to an attacker-controlled server
instead. There were two large-scale DNS
hijacking campaigns active during 2019,
referred to as DNSpionage and Sea
Turtle. DNSpionage was uncovered in
November 2018, as a campaign initially
targeting Lebanon and the UAE.
In April 2019, a state-sponsored attack
manipulating DNS systems was
disclosed and named Sea Turtle.
•

The two campaigns use different
person-in-the-middle technologies,
different proxies, and different
infrastructure, yet both targeted DNS
infrastructure providers and
government entities.

•

•

The Iran-based threat actor behind
DNSpionage compromised the name
servers of legitimate public sector
websites in Lebanon and the UAE.27
This allowed the threat actor to
change DNS records for victim
websites and, as a result, users
attempting to reach the legitimate
websites were unwittingly redirected
to rogue IP addresses instead.
Websites including ministries,
airlines, and public domains in the
Middle East were impacted.
Teal Kurma – the Turkey-based threat
actors behind Sea Turtle – used
various methods to carry out DNS
hijacking attacks.28 They
compromised organisations, pivoting
through networks searching for
credentials that would allow them to
change DNS records. They also
compromised DNS registrars. DNS
registrars sell domain names and
manage the DNS records on behalf

of the customers. By compromising
the registrars, the threat actor could
change the registrars’ customers’
DNS records. Open-source reporting
alleges that the Sea Turtle threat
actor compromised at least one DNS
registry. Registries manage top level
domains, such as .com and .co.uk;
compromising a DNS registry would
allow the threat actor to alter a much
greater number of DNS records.
A concern for the near future is that other
threat actors will follow Sea Turtle’s
success and also attack the global DNS
system – attacks that ultimately
undermine the trust users have in the
internet itself.

Certified!
North Korea-based threat actor Black
Artemis is known for its abuse of valid
code-signing certificates to exploit trust
and pass antivirus checks.29 In June
2019, PwC analysts detected Black
Artemis activity resembling the
tradecraft displayed in an earlier
intrusion against a Chilean bank.30
The threat actor was using a valid digital
certificate, issued by a global security
company to a UK-based private limited
company, to sign a GUI application
mimicking a recruitment form, but
actually downloading a malicious
payload in the background. PwC
assesses it is highly likely that the threat
actor, or a cyber crime signing service in
its supply chain, impersonated the
UK-based company to obtain a valid
certificate, rather than compromising the
legitimate company, and that it is unlikely
that the threat actor was trying to phish
victims by posing as such a company.
What was notable in this campaign was
that the threat actor employed a
sophisticated process in order to obtain
the certificate. Firstly, it likely conducted
reconnaissance of vendors based in the
UK with some software development
capability, then, the threat actor directly
contacted the certificate issuer
masquerading as a legitimate company.

The certificate issuer likely verified the
legitimate company’s identity based on
the spoofed email address and other
reputation-based services – which
means that to succeed in spoofing the
UK-based company, the threat actor had
to socially engineer a reputation-based
service, requesting an update of the
contact details for the legitimate
company and providing a spoofed email
address instead. The same certificate
was then used to sign a code injector
utility utilised in a different campaign.31
Threat actor Andariel, which PwC tracks
as a sub-group of Black Artemis, also
abused valid digital certificates in the
summer of 2019.32 The threat actor
exploited a certificate issued by a South
Korean software security company to
sign binaries of a new reloaded version
of its historic tool Rifdoor in an
espionage campaign PwC tracked as
ANONYBR.

No Mr. Bond, I expect to read all

In 2019, PwC analysed a malicious
implant targeting mobile
telecommunications infrastructure,33
later called ‘MESSAGETAP’ in opensource reporting.34 The implant runs at
root level, which requires a threat actor
to have already compromised a target in

the telecommunications sector before
deploying this tool. The malware is
specifically designed to target Short
Message Service (SMS) Centres and is
able to monitor SMS messages in real
time and extract their content and
metadata. Given the features and
capabilities of the malware, PwC
assesses it is likely that the threat actor
behind MESSAGETAP compromised
telecommunications infrastructure used
for SMS, and exploited the knowledge
gained for cyber espionage activities.
MESSAGETAP has the ability to target
specific phone and International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI) numbers, and
even specific keywords contained in
messages. PwC saw evidence
suggesting that the malware was in
development around May 2018, and that
particular countries were being
specifically targeted.
Similar tools were previously reported as
being operated by intelligence agencies.
It will be crucial to continue monitoring
the evolution of this tool and activity
associated with it, as the ability for a
threat actor to deploy MESSAGETAP
implies a capability to conduct both
mass-scale as well as precise
surveillance on targets.

Threats to mobile

One of the defining trends of 2019 was
the growing attention that threat actors
turned to mobile malware and
trojanised mobile applications, as well
as to the exploitation of mobile devices
more broadly.
PwC saw numerous threat actors active
in this space, either using exploits to
directly compromise victim mobile
devices, or socially engineering targets
into installing malicious applications on
their mobile phones. Aside from
financially motivated cyber criminal
activities, in many of the cases that PwC
observed mobile malware, it was used to
target specific demographics, groups, or
even individuals.

Malware in your pocket: Malicious applications make the rounds
Case study – ROKDROID, DragonMessenger, KevDroid
In August 2019, PwC tracked an
espionage campaign by North Koreabased threat actor Black Shoggoth.
The threat actor posed as an exponent
of a Christian minority within North
Korea in need of aid, indicating
possible targeting of religious
communities or defectors. The threat
actor also sent spear-phishing emails
mentioning a North Korean uranium
mine; with realistic probability, the
threat actor was trying to attract
interest from the victim given the
concurrent escalation of North Korean
missile testing. The spear-phishing
emails delivered samples of one of
Black Shoggoth’s main tools, ROKRAT,
as well as a malicious Android
application that PwC named
ROKDROID. The application has
in-built malicious functionality, is
designed to remain persistent across
phone reboots, and starts collecting
information as soon as it is installed on
a victim device. Its permissions
indicate its functionality, which
includes accessing the phone’s camera
and microphone, reading SMS

messages, and processing calls.
ROKDROID is able to communicate
with Yandex or Dropbox C2s, and
contains false-flag configuration
information as well as anti-analysis
measures.
Around the same time as the
ROKDROID campaign, Black
Shoggoth also developed a malicious
Android application known in open
source as DragonMessenger, which,
according to third-party research, was
added to Google Play in October 2019.35
The application was distributed via a
WordPress website posing as a
fundraising service for supporting
North Korean defectors, and targeted
that same demographic for espionage
purposes.
This is not the first time that North
Korea-based threat actors have
experimented with trojanised or
malicious applications, suggesting that
this will, with realistic probability,
continue to be an area of capability for
development by the threat actors.

Case study – Fake voices in Kashmir
In July 2019, PwC detected a malicious
Android application attempting to
impersonate ‘Kashmir Voice’, a blog
containing news about the Kashmir
region.26 Pivoting on the application’s
metadata, PwC analysts identified
multiple related resources: fragments
of document exploits, process dumps,
network fingerprinting tools and
anonymity tools, as well as Android
development frameworks. PwC
assesses that an individual that

35

operates within a known India-based
espionage threat actor likely
developed the Android application.
The application was highly likely
designed for espionage rather than
cyber criminal purposes, targeting
individuals in Kashmir or with an
interest in Kashmir, during a
heightened state of geopolitical
tension around the region.

Dangers to two-factor
authentication
Cyber criminal threat actors also
increasingly targeted mobile devices as
a new revenue stream. The techniques
and tools used varied from fraudulent
banking applications used to capture
access credentials, to full-scale malware
systems designed to intercept messages
and harvest data stored on infected
devices.36 The introduction of the
Second European Payment Services
Directive (PSD2) in 2019 added Strong
Customer Authentication (SCA) to online

transactions and contactless payments.
Once fully implemented, online
transactions will require some form of
two-factor authentication (2FA), and
many 2FA solutions rely on
authentication via SMS or voice
messages to confirm transactions.
Cyber criminal threat actors have already
developed techniques targeting SMS
2FA solutions used for online banking
and ecommerce systems. For example,
in February 2019, threat actors
intercepted text messages containing
two-factor authentication codes for
customer transactions with a UK-based

bank.37 They exploited flaws in the
Signalling System 7 protocol to bypass
the two-factor authentication used by
the bank, defrauding a small number of
customers. In a later case, the threat
actors behind the TrickBot malware
introduced a new module in July 2019 to
capture data required to conduct
SIM-swapping attacks, which enables
them to port a victim’s mobile phone
account to a device under criminal
control. Once established, the attackers
can intercept incoming voice and SMS
messages and authorise payments via
SMS-based 2FA.38

Cyber crime scene

Cyber criminal activity continued to be
an extremely significant threat to
commercial organisations and
enterprises. Despite law enforcement
crackdowns and temporary lulls in
activity, the cyber criminal market
effectively consolidated around large,
established players behind some of the
largest cyber criminal operations. PwC
also observed a solid continuation of
2018 trends, including formjacking and
Magecart skimmers (which we discuss
later in this section), as well as the
proliferation of ransomware variants –
ranging between spam operations and
extremely narrowly targeted attacks.
However, PwC also saw new financially
motivated threat actors rise to
prominence, such as TA505, known for
large scale spam operations, and White
Jackalope (a.k.a. Silence) with its
international targeting of banks.
Likewise, the cyber criminal market
increasingly sought a diversification of
revenue streams; rather than relying on
the theft of banking credentials or POS
malware, ransomware was often seen as
an effective means to this end.
Finally, one of the most interesting
observations on the cyber criminal front
in 2019 was evidence suggesting that
certain threat actors, long considered to be
espionage motivated and with objectives
aligned to national interests, have been
duplicating and dividing their efforts to
also perform cyber criminal activities.

Double-down espionage-crime
Historically, criminal threat actors and
advanced persistent threats (APTs) acted
in strict alignment with their individual
aim or tasking, focusing on fulfilling one
specific objective – either espionage or

39
40
41
42
43

financial gain for example. Even in cases
where a threat actor would run multiple
concurrent campaigns with different
victims, these tended to be linked by an
overarching purpose such as intellectual
property theft, or intelligence collection.
In 2019 however, PwC observed a
growing trend of threat actors ‘doublingdown’ their operations: conducting
sophisticated and targeted espionage
campaigns as well as financially
motivated ones, at times even
concurrently. In some cases, the
financially motivated element of these
‘double’ operations is run on the side of
other tasking by the same operators
responsible for espionage campaigns.
However, in other cases, this duplication
of purpose and targets highly likely
stems from direct or indirect state
tasking aligning with government
strategic objectives.
It’s not all games
The threat actor that PwC tracks as Red
Kelpie (a.k.a. APT41) has been active
since at least 2012, and has
compromised a significant number of
organisations on a global scale and
across sectors including technology,
telecommunications, and healthcare. In
compromising such organisations, Red
Kelpie mostly sought to exfiltrate
intellectual property, confidential
business information, or intelligence to
be used for surveillance – but the same
threat actor is also known to attack
victims for financially motivated
reasons.39, 40 In its continued targeting of
the video game industry since 2012, and
of cryptocurrency organisations since at
least 2019, Red Kelpie used the same
toolset for both financially motivated
attacks and espionage operations.

However, despite overlaps in toolset and
infrastructure,41 the manipulation of
in-game currencies as well as attempts
to deploy commodity ransomware on
certain victims’ systems suggest that
Red Kelpie runs financially motivated
operations that are separate, and very
different, from its espionage activity.
Crimson for crime
Another espionage-focused threat actor
that also engaged in cyber criminal
activity is Green Havildar. Green Havildar
has been consistent in its targeting of the
Indian government and military, as well
as other nations, such as Kazakhstan,
since 2016. In this timespan, the threat
actor has progressively widened its
toolset, automated the building of its
main malware tool CrimsonRAT, and
taken steps to incrementally improve its
anti-detection capabilities as well as
operational security.42 However, in 2018,
PwC was able to connect Green Havildar
to Gorgon Group, a threat actor
engaging in financially motivated cyber
criminal activity. At that time, PwC
assessed that Gorgon Group at the very
least shared access to resources as well
as infrastructure with Green Havildar.32 In
the autumn of 2019, PwC tracked a spam
campaign by Gorgon Group distributing
commodity backdoors as well as
CrimsonRAT for cyber criminal purposes,
rather than espionage. The use of
CrimsonRAT, which so far is uniquely
tied to Green Havildar, supports the
assessment that Gorgon Group is an
integral part of Green Havildar, and that
it is able to conduct financially motivated
campaigns that are independent of the
threat actor’s espionage operations.43

Shoot to the stars (and the crypto)
Continuing on from their 2018 activity,
North Korea-based threat actors Black
Artemis and Black Banshee aggressively
pursued and mixed cyber espionage and
financially motivated cyber criminal
activity.44 In 2019, both threat actors had
a shared focus on the aerospace and
defence sectors from an espionage
standpoint, while also showing
consistent targeting of financial
institutions and organisations in the
cryptocurrency space.45, 46, 47

Incumbent leaders in cyber crime:
Old dogs, new tricks – Part 1
Some of the most prominent criminal
threat actors have been active since the
early 2000s, often originally as
subordinate members or affiliates of
now-defunct groups. These groups used
to be active on criminal forums, where
they recruited affiliates for their own
enterprises or hired services from third
parties. In 2019, the old guard were far
less active in this respect, instead relying
on trusted relationships that they built up
from years of successful cooperation.

Although identified as an emerging
phenomenon in 2018, 2019 has seen a
clear convergence in some of the tools,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
employed by a range of established
threat actors. Those previously focused
on point-of-sale (POS) systems in the
retail and hospitality sector broadened
their targeting to include online retailers
and modified their toolsets as a
consequence. Similarly, while threat
actors in control of high-profile
credential stealing malware, such as
TrickBot and Dridex, continued to
harvest financial data from consumers,
these threat actors increasingly used
those systems as a platform from which
to launch targeted ransomware attacks
against a range of corporate victims.
However, targeted ransomware attacks
were also carried out by threat actors
that had previously been engaged
exclusively with POS malware, possibly
through cooperation with specialist
ransomware actors or by becoming
affiliates of ransomware operations.

Formjacking frenzy: Magecart
The umbrella term ‘Magecart’ describes
the use of JavaScript-based malware to
capture payment card information from
compromised online retailers or their
third-party ecommerce platforms. The
technique is often referred to as ‘digital
skimming’ or ‘formjacking’ as the
malware grabs the data entered by a
consumer during the checkout process.
Unlike POS malware, Magecart not only
captures payment card information, but
also the billing address, CVV2 number,
and (depending on the data required by
the retailer) email and phone number.
Magecart is not a single entity but rather
consists of at least 30 different threat
actors that possess varying levels of
sophistication and employ different
TTPs. The most prominent Magecart
threat actor is Magecart Group 5, which
is associated with the compromise of a
major ticket sales and distribution
company, and specialises in targeting
third-party suppliers to compromise

multiple ecommerce operators.
Magecart Group 6 targets ‘household
name’ companies and was attributed to
attacks on an international airline and a
major consumer electronics retailer. In
October 2019, reports revealed that
Magecart Group 6 is likely linked to
White Giant (a.k.a. FIN6), also
responsible for an attack on an
ecommerce platform provider that put
over 3,000 online retailers at risk.48
FINs can only get better?
FIN6, FIN7, and FIN8 are threat actors
that specialise in targeting the retail and
hospitality sectors, with the primary
objective of harvesting payment card
information from compromised
networks. Their attacks involve either the
deployment of malware onto multiple
POS devices within a compromised
network or attacking the victim’s
payment processing systems. While all
the threat actors share similar TTPs
(spear-phishing attacks, living off the
land, and penetration testing tools) they
all have unique characteristics: FIN6 and
FIN8 have their own bespoke POS
malware (FrameworkPOS and ShellTea
respectively) while FIN7 has developed
and deployed a new range of tools in
2019. In most of their attacks, the threat
actors attempt to maintain persistence in
the compromised network for as long as
possible in order to harvest payment
card information over an extended
period. These intrusions can last for
several months and in the past resulted
in the compromise of hundreds of
thousands, and in some high-profile
cases, millions of payment cards.49, 50

the data encoded on the magnetic stripe
of a payment card when it is swiped
through a card reader. This data, known as
a ‘dump’ by criminal actors, is sold on
specialist criminal vendor sites, the most
prominent of which is Joker’s Stash.
In 2019, it was predicted that the cost of
counterfeit payment card fraud in the US
would drop in line with the growing use of
EMV technology in the restaurant,
hospitality and retail sectors.51 Within
criminal forums, there was speculation that
wider use of EMV in the US would disrupt
the market for dumps. However, both the
price and supply of dumps appears to
have been stable throughout 2019. In
August 2019, Joker’s Stash announced the
sale of 5.3 million dumps in what was
advertised as the Solar Energy Breach,
although they were careful to release the
data in batches rather than flood the market
with all 5 million cards in one go. The data
appeared to be harvested from a US
retailer. In October 2019, Joker’s Stash
advertised a further 1.3 million dumps, this
time originating from India.52, 53 In view of
continued release and sale of dumps data,
it is clear that the hoped-for decline in
POS malware operations did not
materialise in 2019.

Enter the stage: new players in the
cyber criminal space
In a Silence way
The financially motivated threat actor
White Jackalope (a.k.a. Silence) has
been active since mid-2016, and was
first reported on in open source at the
end of 2017.54, 55 In 2018 and 2019, the
activity of the threat actor significantly
increased, as well as the scope of its
targeting.56, 57 Originally focusing on the
banking sector in Russia, the threat actor

expanded its targeting to include Asia,
and eventually the rest of Europe.
White Jackalope has evolved its toolset
over time, adjusting its initial downloaders
and payloads to constantly evade
detection. Its ongoing campaign, being
conducted across countries in Eastern
Europe, uses a technique called 'ATM
jackpotting' – compromising ATM
systems in order to dispense cash at will,
and relying on a network of money mules
to physically move and launder the notes.
The cyber criminal threat actor achieved
its aims through two alternative paths
of intrusion:
•

Compromising the bank’s internal
ATM network (known as a card
management system) and enabling a
waiting money mule to physically
withdraw money using bank-issued
credit cards at the victim bank’s
ATMs; and

•

Compromising the card processing
system to remove or alter the
withdrawal limit (usually USD 1,000)
for use in conjunction with stolen
cards to yield the greatest amount
per stolen card.

In July 2019, the threat actor reportedly
cost a targeted bank a total of USD 3 million
and leveraged a combination of physical
and cyber aspects to enable the theft
of money.58
The tactics of White Jackalope led us to
assess that this cyber criminal threat
actor is likely to be sophisticated and
continue attempting to remain
stealthy (excluding the activities of its
mule operators).

Spotlight on TA505
TA505 is a cyber criminal threat actor,
active since at least 2014, which first
came to prominence for large-scale
malicious spam operations primarily
delivering Dridex. Since then, the group
has been associated with numerous
spam campaigns delivering a broad
range of malicious payloads, including
the banking trojans TrickBot and Shifu
and the ransomware systems Locky and
GlobeImposter.59 In addition to providing
a delivery mechanism for other threat
actors, TA505 is associated with the
development and deployment of its own
bespoke malware, including
FlawedAmmyy and FlawedGrace.

In 2019, the threat actor redoubled its
efforts, introducing multiple new tools
and broadening its range of targets. In
October 2019, the actor began deploying
a new modular malware system known
as SDBot after introducing two new
downloaders: Andromut and Get2.60 In
November 2019, PwC identified a new
high-volume TA505 campaign targeting a
wide range of industry sectors and
victims,61 which used several legitimate
URL shortening services to direct
victims to fake landing pages. These
were used to host downloadable
versions of the penetration testing
tool Cobalt Strike as part of an initial
infection process.

ATM cashouts
The first case of ATM jackpotting took place in Mexico in 2013,62 where threat
actors attached a new boot disk that installed malware on the ATMs. Attacks
have since become more sophisticated, with prominent campaigns including the
following:
• Since at least late 2016, Black
Artemis has targeted banks in
Africa and Asia in order to gain
access to payment switch
application servers and enable
fraudulent ATM cash withdrawals;63
•

64

In late 2018, Black Artemis
compromised the corporate
network of the Chilean ATM
interbank network – while the

organisation claims the incident
was mitigated before any money
was stolen, it is likely the attack
was financially motivated;64 and,
•

In 2019, reporting uncovered
attacks against banks across Asia
that resulted in ATM jackpotting.
These are attributed to a criminal
threat actor, White Jackalope
(a.k.a. Silence).58

Spotlight on Cobalt Group
The Cobalt Group is a threat actor that
has specialised mainly in ATM attacks
since it first became active in 2016. Its
name is derived from the legitimate
penetration testing tool Cobalt Strike: the
threat actor was one of the first criminal
groups to adopt the use of this tool as
part of its standard TTPs. Throughout
the year, the threat actor used a
combination of third-party tools,
including Terraloader (also known as
more_eggs) and a malicious document
builder for dropping and executing
JavaScript. The most distinguishing
aspect of its operations was the
continued use of its own bespoke
malware, CobInt. Cobalt campaigns were
almost continuous during 2019, with a
variety of phishing lures designed for
attacking financial institutions. Many of
these were spoofed to appear to be from
the European Central Bank, while others
purported to contain the outcome of
legal or financial arbitration decisions.
Based on the language used for its
phishing messages, Cobalt was mainly
targeting victims in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia, with a smaller number of
attacks focused on Central America and
the Middle East.

Diversification of revenue

Emotet resurgent

Old dogs, new tricks – Part 2

In the first quarter of 2019, Emotet was
one of the most prolific malware delivery
systems, accounting for 60% of email
traffic containing malicious payloads
(attachments and hyperlinks).65 At the
end of May 2019, Emotet suspended
operations: its C2 network dropped
connections to infected hosts and spam
campaigns halted. On 22nd August 2019,
Emotet’s C2 network reactivated and by
9th September its C2 servers began
pushing out new binaries to infected
hosts. Spam operations resumed on
16th September and began pushing out
new spam campaigns almost daily.66 The
reliance of multiple threat actors on
delivery systems such as Emotet saw a
continuation of a well-established trend:
the use of phishing techniques to deliver
weaponised attachments that all but
supplanted the use of exploit kits as a
means of introducing malware into
targeted networks.

As with all leading credential-stealing
malware, systems like TrickBot, Dridex,
Ursnif and Ramnit are modular in design
and can tailor their functionality based
on customer requirements. This is
especially the case with inject codes
used to capture bank and ecommerce
login credentials from infected hosts. For
example, TrickBot variants delivered by
an Emotet campaign targeting the UK
are configured to download inject
modules crafted for a range of UK banks
and other entities. But TrickBot can do
more than just capture banking
credentials: in late 2018 TrickBot added
a module to identify POS systems,
enabling threat actors to conduct POS
attacks similar to those employed by
FIN6 and FIN7. As noted earlier in this
report, in 2019 it added a new inject
module to support SIM-swapping
attacks. And along with Dridex and
possibly Qakbot, TrickBot was
increasingly used in targeted
ransomware attacks.

In addition to its capacity to deliver high
volumes of broadcast spam, increasing
use was made of Emotet’s spearphishing capabilities in 2019. The
malware harvests the content of email
accounts on infected hosts and can
insert messages into existing email
threads between the infected host and
third parties. It is likely that email thread
injection attacks are more effective than
the bulk delivery of unsolicited
messages: a recipient will be less
suspicious of an attachment in a
message they were expecting to receive
from a known contact. Both broadcast
and spear-phishing techniques were
used as a delivery system by a range of
sophisticated cyber crime threat actors,
including the Trickbot/Ryuk, Gozi/Ursnif
and Qakbot groups. Emotet was also
used less frequently for the delivery
of Dridex.

The DiabolicalTrinity: Emotet/
TrickBot/Ryuk
2019 saw a succession of high-profile
ransomware attacks attributed to Ryuk.
The majority of these incidents involved
an initial infection via Emotet that carried
TrickBot as a secondary payload. The
threat actor used TrickBot’s worming
and lateral movement modules in
combination with legitimate penetration
testing tools and living-off-the-land
techniques to spread through targeted
networks, identify key infrastructure and
install and execute Ryuk. In many cases,
the threat actors spent at least two
weeks inside the victim network before
deploying Ryuk, mainly because the
post-exploitation phase of the attack
involved time-consuming, semi-manual
processes. The impact of a Ryuk attack
means that it was often difficult for
incident responders to demonstrate that

data was exfiltrated prior to the
activation of the ransomware. However,
as the primary delivery method for Ryuk
is a combination of two powerful
credential stealers, which both
automatically harvest data, it is likely that
some degree of data exfiltration
occurred prior to encryption.
Dridex and BitPaymer
Although Dridex threat actors used
Emotet as a delivery mechanism in 2019,
they did not do so as frequently as
TrickBot or Ursnif threat actors. They also
used compromised websites as an
infection vector, inserting malicious
JavaScript into vulnerable websites to
display a fake browser update. Clicking
on the update would activate the initial
malware insertion process. Dridex is
almost uniquely associated with its
ransomware counterpart, BitPaymer.
After the initial Dridex installation process,
a BitPaymer incident follows the same
pattern described in an Emotet/TrickBot/
Ryuk attack. BitPaymer underwent an
upgrade in 2019, and emerged with new
network enumeration capabilities in the
middle of the year to improve the
efficiency of attacks67 – the upgrade
included the use of the address resolution
protocol (arp) to identify devices on a
victim network to add a degree of
automation to the post-exploitation phase
of a Dridex/BitPaymer incident.
Follow the cryptocurrency
The diversification into ransomware
operations was certainly one of the main
cyber crime themes of 2019, but it would
be incorrect to assume Dridex or
TrickBot threat actors abandoned
credential theft in favour of ransomware
operations. Dridex and TrickBot were
originally designed as banking trojans,
and along with other threat actors like
the Ramnit, Ursnif and Qakbot groups,
they still retain this capability and attacks
on online banking systems leveraged by

these groups continued throughout
2019. But these ‘business-as-usual’
activities were overshadowed by the
media attention focused on high-profile
ransomware attacks that resulted from
TrickBot or Dridex infections.
In reality, many of the principal cyber
criminal threat actors operated affiliate
programmes and leased access to their
systems on a fee-paying or profit-sharing
basis. In the case of TrickBot, it is likely
that only a small number of affiliates had
access to Ryuk and that the majority of
TrickBot threat actors were focused on
traditional, credential-stealing activities.
Likewise, only a subset of Dridex actors
appeared to have access to BitPaymer.
The attraction of ransomware was
almost certainly due to its high return
on investment compared to online
banking attacks:

•

Even after funds were transferred to a
bank account under criminal control
(a mule account), in many cases the
victim’s bank was able to freeze the
transfer and prevent the criminals
from withdrawing the funds;

•

A successful transfer of stolen money
required careful coordination with the
mule controllers and is labour intensive;

•

The threat actors must have paid
commission fees to the mule
controllers and often received
little more than 30-40% of the
funds transferred in a successful
attack; and

•

Threat actors engaged in the transfer
and laundering of stolen funds risked
detection and prosecution by law
enforcement organisations.

By contrast, apart from the overheads
associated with managing malware
infrastructure, and membership fees for
participating in an affiliate programme,
ransomware threat actors got to keep

the majority of the funds generated from
successful attacks, and incurred lower
commission fees when they convert
cryptocurrency into fiat currency.
Other threat actors, such as FIN6 and
FIN7, comprehensively demonstrated
their ability to infiltrate and compromise
corporate networks. They mostly did so
for the purpose of deploying POS
malware, which by necessity restricts
their range of available targets. Their
business model is not fully understood,
especially the share of the profits they
make from the sale of compromised
payment card information. While there is
isolated reporting that FIN6 was involved
in LockerGoga and possibly Ryuk
incidents in early 2019,69 PwC is not
aware that they did so in the second half
of the year. However, PwC assesses that
threat actors such as FIN6 have the
technical capability to conduct further
ransomware attacks if they choose.

The majority of online banking
attacks were detected before funds
were transferred;68

Resident Evil: The indictment of
Maksim Yakubets
From a crime perspective, the highlight
of 2019 was the high-profile indictment
of members of the Dridex group,
self-styled as ‘Evil Corp’. Maksim
Yakubets, also known by his online
identity Aqua, and Igor Turashev, a
senior member of the group known
online as Nintutu, were both indicted by
the US Department of Justice on
5th December 2019. Other members of
the group were named (but not indicted)
including Denis Gusev, whose businesses
were subject to US sanctions imposed
by the US Treasury Department. The
indictments were the result of years of
work by the FBI and the UK’s National
Crime Agency (NCA), with the latter
revealing details of the group’s lavish
lifestyle. A significant part of the Dridex
saga was the revelation that Yakubets
had also been working on behalf of the
Federal Security Service (FSB)70, 71 since
2017, in addition to his purely criminal
operations. This appears to be the mirror
image of state actors either officially or
unofficially conducting financially
motivated attacks: a long-established
criminal actor carrying out undisclosed
activities on behalf of the state.72
Ransomware threat intensifies in 2019
The last 12 months have seen a
succession of high-profile ransomware
attacks affecting a broad range of
victims and sectors. In 2018, there was a
notable change in threat actor behaviour,
with an emphasis on targeted attacks in
preference to the large-scale distribution
of ransomware. In 2019, this trend for
‘big game hunting’ became firmly
established with an increase in the
intensity and frequency of attacks, the
70
71

72

75

arrival of new ransomware threat actors
and the deployment of ransomware by
established crime groups that previously
specialised in other types of attack.
Businesses in the manufacturing, oil and
gas, professional services, healthcare
and logistics sectors were all prominent
victims in 2019. Local government and
the education sector were also hit hard,
with the latter experiencing highly
damaging attacks timed to coincide with
the reopening of schools and colleges
in September 2019.
One threat actor known as GandCrab,
which ran an affiliate-based,
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)
platform, announced its ‘retirement’ and
ceased operations in June 2019.
However, a new ransomware strain
known as Sodinokibi or REvil emerged
soon afterwards, and given the coding
similarities between the two malware
families it is likely that Sodinokibi was
little more than a rebranding exercise by
the GandCrab threat actor and the
‘retirement’ was merely a smokescreen.73
Sodinokibi attacks increased in tempo
during the fourth quarter of 2019, with a
number of high profile incidents reported
in the last few weeks of the year.

Case study – Lockergoga
LockerGoga ransomware struck
victim organisations of all sizes
across multiple continents and
industries, yet, in early 2019, a
LockerGoga campaign appeared to
intentionally target organisations in
the manufacturing sector. Norsk
Hydro, one of the largest aluminium
and renewable energy companies,
had systems across 40 countries
infected with LockerGoga malware.
To carry out this targeted attack, the
threat actor likely compromised and
studied Norsk Hydro’s internal IT
architecture prior to deploying the
ransomware. Norsk Hydro was
forced to resort to manual
operations as a result, and the
operational downtime and mitigation
efforts cost the company more than
GBP 47 million in losses.74

Case study – BitPaymer strikes
professional services
In November 2019, the Spanish
professional services company
Everis was the victim of a
ransomware attack.75 Initially, there
was widespread media speculation
that the victim had been targeted by
Ryuk – this was partly because
multiple Ryuk incidents were
underway at the time of the attack,
but also possibly because Ryuk had
gained such notoriety in the
preceding months that it had
become almost synonymous with
ransomware. In reality, the incident
was the result of a BitPaymer attack
that had been leveraged through a
conventional Dridex campaign.

Looming larger: distributed denial of service
attacks keep growing
Throughout 2019, distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attacks remained a
steady trend in the background of other
cyber operations. DDoS attacks rose to
prominence many years earlier as one of
the preferred tools in the arsenal of
hacktivist threat actors as a means to
conduct disruptive action. This was
partly due to the relatively low barrier to
entry for conducting such attacks, and
the highly visible nature of their impact
(i.e. knocking a website or service offline
for a period of time).
As organisations have moved to protect
themselves from DDoS attacks, threat
actors increasingly sought to launch
fewer but more targeted attacks and
developed novel techniques to amplify
attacks and overcome DDoS mitigations.
Furthermore, with the proliferation of
connected devices and the growth of the
Internet of Things (IoT), more and more
exploitation paths and malware families
have emerged to compromise these
devices and enslave them into botnets.
An example from 2019 includes a
multi-stage infection chain delivering a
BillGates malware variant, which was
used to hijack non-updated versions of
Elasticsearch databases and coerce
their host systems into botnet activity.76
Just as the creation of these large-scale
botnet networks in turn facilitated
larger-scale DDoS attacks, the cyber
criminal ecosystem also turned to
DDoS-as-a-Service and DDoS-for-hire
offerings to monetise botnet creation.

76

77

78

79

80

81

Many DDoS-for-hire services are
advertised on the darkweb as stresser
services. Typically, they purport to be
legitimate services for network
administrators, providing a resource to
test the resilience of a network to a
DDoS attack. Pricing for stresser
services varies according to duration of
attacks, with ‘reputable’ services offering
attacks for USD 10 per hour.77 Despite
prominent law enforcement operations
against stresser sites, in 2019 they
continued to persist and were frequently
advertised within online gaming
communities. The attack capabilities of
these services varied, and it is likely that
in many cases their advertised capability
was exaggerated. Academic research
suggests that the commissioning of
DDoS attacks by juveniles within the
online gaming community served as an
entry-level cyber crime and some cases
led to other cyber offending.78
Ransom DDoS
In 2019, cyber criminal threat actors
continued targeting businesses with
DDoS attacks – even attempting to extort
victims for financial gain to refrain from, or
cease, targeted DDoS attacks. In some
cases, threat actors will send victims a
ransom note demanding payment even
before an actual attack is performed,
promising a ‘small attack’ as a tester to
threaten victims and coerce them into
paying attackers to deter them from
launching an actual DDoS attack. In one
example, a financially motivated threat
actor posed as Russia-based espionage
threat actor Blue Athena (a.k.a. Fancy
Bear),79 to appear more intimidating to

victims given Blue Athena’s reputation.
The threat actor indicated the time when
it would start a prospective DDoS against
the victim, and requested payment of
around USD 15,000 in Bitcoin to desist
from the attack.
In other cases, threat actors directly
attacked victims with DDoS attacks, only
to then send ransom requests.
South African financial institutions were
one of the primary targets for such
attacks in the last quarter of 2019,80
leading the South African Banking Risk
Information Centre (SABRIC) to issue an
advisory on the matter. Reportedly, the
attacks mainly affected the banks’
customer-facing services rather than
internal operations. Although these
attacks did not cause material impact,
the danger posed by DDoS attacks to
sectors heavily relying on web portals
– finance and retail, for instance –
remains significant.
Hacktivists strike back
As organisations continued to improve
their cyber defences, and law
enforcement increasingly cracked down
on individuals and collectives
responsible for computer misuse,
hacktivist activity has relatively
subsided. However, in April 2019,
Ecuador came temporarily under siege,
as DDoS attacks were directed at
websites including those of Ecuador’s
Foreign Ministry, Presidential office, and
Central bank.81 The attacks against
Ecuadorian internet infrastructure
allegedly came in retaliation against the
Ecuadorian government’s decision to

stop supporting Julian Assange, who
had remained in asylum in the
Ecuadorian Embassy in London since
2012. In April 2019, Assange was
expelled from the embassy and arrested
by British authorities. Following this,
threat actors self-identifying as Grey
Ares – the loosely-tied hacker syndicate
collectively known as Anonymous –
launched a DDoS attack against the
NCA, causing intermittent minimal
downtime to the NCA’s website.
The operations of hacktivist threat actors
like Grey Ares can be unpredictable,
given that the rationale with which they
pick their targets may not always, like in
the case above, be immediately
apparent. Hacktivist activity involving
DDoS can cause disruption when
executed at scale but PwC, as well as
numerous independent studies, observe
that such operations are becoming rarer
with time82, 83 – and that effective
preparation can help fend off such
attacks.

No news good news: DDoS silencing
The ability of DDoS attacks to
overwhelm web servers and take internet
infrastructure offline makes it an
effective, if temporary, means to disrupt
information sources. In late October
2019, Georgia was the target of a wave
of cyber attacks bringing excessive
traffic to servers and effectively knocking
offline about 2,000 websites as well as
the national TV station.84 While
thousands of web pages including that
of the Georgian President were defaced
with warnings of other future cyber
attacks, two TV broadcasters were sent
offline, with one reportedly having
equipment damaged as a consequence
of the attacks. Georgia had already been
a victim of various DDoS attacks during
the Russian-Georgian war, including
DDoS attacks directed at the South
Ossetian government.
In September 2019, online encyclopedia
Wikipedia was also targeted by a
large-volume DDoS attack that lasted
around nine hours,85, 86 causing
downtime across Europe, Africa, and the
Middle East as well as slower connection
in the US and Asia. The Wikimedia
Foundation characterised the incident as
a ‘malicious attack’ by ‘a bad faith actor’.

Earlier in 2019, numerous Philippine
alternative media outlets had also come
under sustained DDoS attacks that
repeatedly knocked the websites offline
and made them temporarily inaccessible
by visitors as well as administrators.87
The National Union of Journalists of the
Philippines (NUJP) was also targeted
numerous times. The DDoS attacks on
these media outlets took place around
the same time, between December 2018
and February 2019, in the period of the
2019 midterm elections. According to a
forensic investigation, the DDoS
attacks were performed using a botnetfor-hire service.88
As organisations increasingly adopt
DDoS mitigation solutions, the scale of
DDoS attacks will continue to grow as
threat actors find new amplification
techniques. Threat actors seeking to
launch DDoS attacks are also
increasingly reliant on larger botnets to
be able to impart significant downtime
on victims. This, in turn, is fuelling
demand in the cyber criminal
marketplace, leading to continued
activity aimed at amassing bots for
malicious purposes.

Sowing chaos

Shamoon arisen
Sabotage attacks rose to prominence in
2011, with the infamous campaign
targeting Iran’s nuclear programme using
destructive malware, dubbed Stuxnet.
Since then, the use of destructive
malware has evolved to no longer be
entirely motivated by sabotage.
StoneDrill is a sophisticated wiper used
predominantly to cause destruction to
the oil and gas sector in the Middle East,
however, StoneDrill also contains
espionage tools in its arsenal indicating
the destructive malware serves multiple
purposes. StoneDrill is attributed in open
source to Yellow Orc (a.k.a. APT33 or
Elfin),89 an Iran-based threat actor that
has been known to target a wide range
of sectors. Recent StoneDrill activity
could be linked to a statement by the US
Cyber Security and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) from June 2019,
which reported a rise in malicious cyber
security activity directed at US industries
and government agencies by Iran-based
threat actors – in particular an increase
in destructive wiper attacks.90
Traditional destructive attacks purely
seeking to cause destruction still occur.
First observed in 2012, when it wiped the
systems of a state-owned oil producer in
the Middle East, Shamoon was used to
repeatedly target Saudi Arabia and its

89

90

91
92
93
94

95

critical sectors, causing major data and
financial losses and disruption. In
December 2018, a third wave of
Shamoon attacks targeted Italian oil and
gas contractor Saipem, as well as two
similar organisations from Saudi Arabia
and the UAE.
Shamoon malware is inherently
destructive, wiping data on victim
systems and impeding their reboot. It
consists of a tripartite structure, with its
dropper, wiper, and reporter functionality
contained in three different implants.
10% of Saipem’s systems were infected,
the vast majority of which were located
in the Middle East.
In late 2019, researchers identified a new
wiper malware family called ZeroCleare
in open-source reporting. Similarly to
Shamoon, ZeroCleare was deployed
against targets in the Middle East, and
exploited a specific unsigned system
driver to load wiper code on victim
systems.91

Information operations
Information operations – i.e. attempts to
‘influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the
decision making of adversaries and
potential adversaries while protecting
[its] own’92 – rose to prominence in 2016
with the infamous case of Russia-based
threat actors accused of meddling in the

2016 US presidential election. Election
interference via information operations is
now a well-documented phenomena,
however, 2019 highlighted the use of
information operations for other
nefarious activities.
Research from 2019 identified 53 cases
of foreign influence efforts (FIEs)93 –
coordinated campaigns by one state to
impact politics in another state through
media channels – in 24 victim countries
from 2013 to 2018.94 Two of the cases
were ongoing as of April 2019. In total,
72% of the campaigns were conducted
by threat actors based in Russia, with
threat actors based in China and Iran
accounting for most of the remainder.
While many of the cases sought to shape
election outcomes, others focused on
discrediting specific political actors,
such as a campaign targeting the Syrian
Civil Defence Force. In other campaigns,
threat actors attempted to shift the
political agenda on specific topics, such
as from health to security. The proposal
of the extradition bill sparked protests in
Hong Kong, and disinformation was
used in support of both the protestors
and the police.95 Finally, campaigns
encouraged political polarisation –
Russia-based threat actors
simultaneously supported the Black
Lives Matter and the White Lives Matter
counter-movements. Within Australian,
Brazilian, Candian, and South African
politics, Russia-based threat actors
attempted to polarise the debate.

Case study – Document leak

documents made the headlines in July
2019,96, 97 after a hacktivist group leaked
a cache of data pertaining to be from the
internal networks of Moscow-based
company SyTech. Whilst the documents
provide interesting insight into the type
of research being conducted – including
into Tor deanonymisation, social media
tracking and email monitoring – it is
important to bear in mind that the cache
remains unverified and the authenticity
of the documents therefore
questionable. The motivation behind this
attack is unknown, however, PwC has
seen similar hack and leak operations
attempting to further the threat actor’s
cause, as seen in the following example.

Case study – Oil(Rig) leaks expose an
information operation
In June 2019, information on tools and
infrastructure attributed to Iran-based
threat actor, Yellow Maero, were
exposed in a series of leaks.98 PwC
assesses it highly likely that this activity
forms part of an information operation
seeking to disrupt Iran’s espionage
operations. By promoting the narrative
that the Ministry of Intelligence of the
Islamic Republic of Iran (MOIS) is
sinister and betraying the Iranian people,
the threat actor is likely attempting to
sow discord within Iran’s domestic
population.

Shattering the mirror maze of information operations
In 2016, Russia-based threat actors were
accused of interfering in the US
presidential election, highlighting how
social media can be exploited to
promote a political agenda, sow discord,
and incite polarisation. Meanwhile, in
other cases, information operations
aimed to undermine the objective
assessment of evidence, providing
multiple ‘alternative narratives’ or
promoting falsehoods. In the fallout of
2016, social media companies vowed to
step up to identify and combat
disinformation on their platforms. The
same research that identified 53 cases
of foreign influence efforts also
concluded that the information
operations’ preferred social media
platforms were Twitter and Facebook,
likely due to the scale of their reach.99, 100
In 2019, Facebook alongside Twitter and
Google continued disabling accounts
associated with information operations
from around the world. Overall, they
disclosed 51 campaigns through 2019,
from threat actors based in at least 28
countries and targeting more than 68
countries around the world.
In addition to social media platforms,
countries around the world are making
changes to protect against information
operations. In May 2019, the European
Union adopted a new sanctions regime
that would impose penalties on
individuals, companies, and government
organisations that are involved in cyber
attacks.101 The new regime came into
effect ahead of the European Union
parliament elections, as both a deterrent
and a response.

Conclusion
In 2019, PwC analysts witnessed and
documented a convergence of the
physical and cyber domains, as
campaigns continued to align, in
targeting and aims, with international
relations. Mirroring this association, in
phishing campaigns in particular, threat
actors often delivered timely and relevant
malicious lure documents to victims in
order to infect them, with short
turnaround periods between a piece of
news being published and its
weaponisation in malicious operations.
PwC observed tit-for-tat operations
alongside longer-term intelligence
collection efforts, threat actors’
overlapping interests turn into cases of
fourth-party collection, as well as an
increasing focus on surveillance by
espionage motivated threat actors.

30 | Cyber Threats 2019: A Year in Retrospect | PwC

Especially – though not exclusively – in
relation to surveillance and information
collection, one of the defining trends of
2019 was the growing attention threat
actors afforded to mobile devices. PwC
saw multiple cyber criminal and
espionage threat actors either using
exploits to directly compromise mobile
devices, or socially engineering victims
into installing malicious applications on
their mobile phones. In many cases,
PwC observed mobile malware used to
target specific demographics, groups, or
even individuals.
Supply chains continued to be a key
targeting focus, with sophisticated threat
actors (and especially China-based
threat actors) going after third parties or
acquired companies, or even trusted
software providers, in order to reach
organisations and their customers –
exploiting the trust and privileged access
afforded to third-party suppliers.

In 2019, PwC saw evidence suggesting
that certain threat actors, long
considered to be espionage motivated
and with objectives aligned to national
interests, have duplicated and divided
their efforts to also perform cyber
criminal activities.
While PwC saw new threat actors rise to
prominence in the cyber criminal space,
the cyber criminal market effectively
consolidated around large, established
players that maintained, managed, and
updated some of the largest cyber
criminal operations. Many of the
principal cyber criminal threat actors
– the likes of Emotet, Dridex, as well as
FIN threat actors – operated affiliate
programmes and leased access to
their systems on a fee-paying or
profit-sharing basis.

Even in the financially motivated cyber
crime space, PwC observed a solid
continuation of 2018 trends, including
formjacking, Magecart skimmers, theft
of banking credentials and POS
malware. Yet the diversification into
ransomware operations was one of the
main cyber crime themes of 2019. The
last 12 months, continuing from a trend
established in 2018, have seen a
succession of high profile ransomware
attacks affecting a broad range of
victims and sectors. More and more, the
affiliate programmes mentioned above
also see ‘stable’ relationships between
specific spam operations and
ransomware actors – for example the
triad Emotet – TrickBot – Ryuk.

In terms of sabotage attacks, throughout
2019, DDoS attacks remained a steady
trend in the background of other cyber
operations. With the proliferation of
connected devices and the growth of the
IoT, more and more exploitation paths
and malware families are emerging to
compromise these devices and enslave
them into botnets.
Nevertheless, sabotage operations
leveraging malware are increasingly
taking on destructive objectives. In 2019,
wiper and destructive malware have
continued posing a threat to
organisations – specifically in the Middle
East and United States – between
December 2018’s third wave of Shamoon
attacks and destructive activity
using ZeroCleare malware in late
December 2019.

Yet also in 2019, sabotage operations
exhibited a more subtle, treacherous
side that has been on the rise for
the past few years: that of causing
disruption through information
operations. For example, election
interference via information operations is
now a well-documented phenomena,
and in 2019 social media companies
have moved to tackle increasing
‘inauthentic coordinated behaviour’ on
their platforms. In the future, PwC
assesses it highly likely that novel
detection techniques will be required to
build confidence assessments on
media integrity.

Now at the beginning of 2020, PwC has already seen new aggressive intelligence collection
campaigns unfold, all while financially motivated threat actors continue using tried and tested, as
well as novel techniques, to exact profit from victims. PwC assesses that this will continue
throughout 2020, as cyber espionage and sabotage continue to align with international dynamics.

Glossary

Term

Definition

ATM jackpotting

ATM jackpotting involves compromising ATM systems in order to dispense cash.

BabyShark

BabyShark is a piece of malware first seen in November 2018, and attributed to
Black Banshee. It involves a multi-stage, script-based delivery and execution chain
which refers back to the C2 throughout, and it also sets persistence on victim
systems and results in a backdoor payload being installed on infected systems.

BitPaymer

A ransomware family almost always delivered in conjunction with a Dridex
infection. BitPaymer, which embeds numerous anti-analysis and UAC bypass
techniques, often has individual samples and ransom notes tailored to specific
victim environments.

Business Email Compromise (BEC)

A BEC attack involves a threat actor hijacking or closely imitating a legitimate email
account in order to more effectively socially engineer individuals.

Cobalt Strike

Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool, that is marketed as 'adversary
simulation software designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate the postexploitation actions of advanced threat actors'. Despite its legitimate purposes,
CobaltStrike's fully-featured module suite is often used by malicious threat actors
(including advanced persistent threats) in their operations.

Code injection

The malicious introduction of code into a running process, to achieve execution of
malicious actions without any input validation from the system.

CrimsonRAT

A C#/.Net backdoor implant thought to be unique to Green Havildar, capable of a
series of functions including logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and taking
screenshots from infected systems.

DNS hijacking

An attack that maliciously alters the correct resolution of queries to the Domain
Name System (DNS). Such an attack can lead users to unknowingly be redirected to
threat actor-controlled sites, creating the opportunity for traffic interception and
installation of malware.

DragonMessenger

A malicious Android application attributed to Black Shoggoth and added to Google
Play in October 2019 according to third-party research. It was allegedly distributed
via a WordPress website posing as a fundraising service for supporting North
Korean defectors, targeting that same demographic for espionage purposes.

Dridex

A banking trojan active since at least 2014, delivered via spearphishing emails,
Dridex was used to steal banking credentials and to drop ransomware on victim
systems. Despite a takedown in 2015, and the 2019 FBI indictment of one of the
individuals behind the management of the malware, Dridex continues operations and
remains a substantial threat.

DTrack

DTrack is a RAT that we assess has likely been used by Black Artemis since at least
2014. It has been used against numerous targets worldwide, including banks and the
Kundankulam Nuclear Power Plant.

Dumps

Stolen credit card information – specifically, the raw information stored on a card’s
magnetic strip. Dumps are mostly collected through skimming of point of sale
terminals. Criminals may cash out ‘dumps’ by embedding them into a fake credit
card and physically making a purchase in a store – a process known as ‘carding’.

Emotet

Emotet was developed off the Bugat/Cridex/Feodo malware family, and was first
observed in 2014 as a banking trojan. Although it retains credential-stealing
capabilities, Emotet has been converted into a malware delivery system focused on
gaining an initial foothold on victim machines, and is used by a range of
sophisticated cyber crime threat actors. PwC assesses it is highly likely that Emotet
is run on an affiliate model, whereby Emotet administrators form a core group with
multiple affiliates that include Trickbot, Dridex, and IcedID.

Formjacking

Also known as ‘digital skimming’, formjacking involves the surreptitious injection of
malicious JavaScript code into the checkout pages of legitimate websites, to enable
the theft of credit card information and other data (such as billing addresses) from
payment forms.

GermanWiper

A ransomware variant highly likely linked to another mature ransomware family
known as Sodinokibi, based on overlaps in targeting and infrastructure. In a
campaign in the summer of 2019, spear-phishing emails targeted German speakers,
claiming to be from an individual reaching out to a prospective employer seeking a
new professional challenge, with a zip embedding a malicious LNK file.

GlobeImposter

The second most prevalent ransomware family in 2017, GlobeImposter variants
abused spear-phishing, exploit kits and RDP bruteforce to gain access to networks
and encrypt system files. Recently, we observed GlobeImposter not completely
encrypt files, leaving some sections legible, to make file encryption faster (and thus
harder to stop).

Hooking

Any technique that alters the behaviour of the operating system (OS) or any program
by intercepting a program’s execution at a particular point to take another action.
Hooking can enable malware to establish persistence, or to load additional malicious
code within another process.

Incident response

The organised process of investigating, addressing, and mitigating a cyber security
incident or cyber attack. Incident response often involves pre-incident planning, and
ties in with other critical business functions, ensuring that an organisation can
continue business as usual while countering a threat or recovering from an incident.

Information operations

Information operations are attempts to ‘influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the
decision making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting [its] own’.

Joker’s Stash

A criminal marketplace specialised in stolen card data, where data coming from a
single breach is often sold in several tranches. Joker’s Stash was opened in 2014,
and has representation on numerous other cyber criminal and carding forums.

Kazuar backdoor

A .Net backdoor attributed to Blue Python, consisting of an executable and a loaded
DLL. Kazuar supports numerous capabilities, including acting as an HTTP server
able to receive commands from a remote attacker.

Living off the land

Using legitimate tools and processes, often already installed on a victim’s device, to
reduce the chance of an attack being detected.

LookBack

LookBack is a C++ RAT with capabilities that include system, process, and file
discovery and manipulation, screen capture as well as remote interaction with the
host. The RAT leverages a proxy communication module to create a proxied C2
channel, through which LookBack exfiltrates data from the infected host. LookBack
has been observed targeting a few specific sectors, including academia.

Lure document

A document designed to attract the attention of a user – to ‘lure’ them – while
malware is being installed on the victim’s machine. The document can be simply a
decoy, or weaponised with malicious code.

Magecart

The umbrella term Magecart describes threat actors that use JavaScript-based
malware to capture payment card information from compromised online retailers or
their third party ecommerce platforms.

MESSAGETAP

A malicious implant targeted at mobile telecommunications infrastructure, that
carries out real-time monitoring of SMS services.

Nodersok

A strain of fileless malware, installed via the execution of a HTML Application (HTA)
file. Nodersok uses a multi-stage process to download and install several legitimate
tools, including Node.exe (the Windows implementation of Node.js), and WinDivert, a
packet capture tool. Nodersok then abuses these tools to proxy victims’ traffic, in
order to intercept personal data and credentials.

NOKKI backdoor

A backdoor attributed to Black Shoggoth, consisting of a main executable and
loaded DLL. NOKKI is designed to steal information from victims, and has been
deployed against numerous targets, including victims in South Korea and victims
speaking Cambodian and Cyrillic.

Owl

The Owl backdoor uses the Windows HTTP API to serve HTTP endpoints, providing
command execution on the host and the ability to proxy traffic into an internal
network, making an infected webserver a potential pivot point for the threat actor.

POS malware

Malware installed on point of sale terminals used to harvest credit card and debit
card information, by intercepting its processing at checkout and forwarding it to
attacker-controlled servers. An example of POS malware is FIN6’s FrameworkPOS.

Reconnaissance

The process, undertaken by threat actors, of researching available information about
a target, including attempting to identify vulnerabilities in target systems or
individuals of interest.

Rifdoor

A backdoor attributed to Andariel, a threat actor that PwC tracks as a subset of
North Korea-based Black Artemis. Rifdoor has been documented in its basic form
since at least 2015; in 2019, PwC observed an updated variant of the malware with
added capabilities such as screen capture.

ROKRAT

One of Black Shoggoth's main tools, ROKRAT is a backdoor using Cloud services for
C2 that was first observed in 2016, and has undergone active development at least
up until 2018.

ROKROID

A malicious Android application attributed to Black Shoggoth, and delivered to
victims via URL shortened links embedded in spear-phishing emails. ROKDROID has
a large set of capabilities, including recording calls, exfiltrating call logs, and
interacting with a C2 server.

Ryuk

A ransomware family almost always deployed after an initial infection of Emotet has
installed TrickBot on victim systems. It has been used in a number of highly targeted
attacks against enterprises, with ransom notes unique to compromised victims.

ShadowPad backdoor

A backdoor that was used to trojanise management software: this was the first stage
in a complex supply-chain attack aimed at profiling victims to identify interesting
targets to compromise further. ShadowPad contains multiple anti-analysis
techniques, and is able to set persistence on victim systems and escalate privileges,
as well as to send system profiling information back to its C2.

Shamoon

Shamoon is a destructive malware family that was observed in extremely targeted
attacks in 2012, 2016, and 2018. Comprising of three components – a dropper, a
reporter, and a wiper – Shamoon is engineered to cause the greatest damage
possible by spreaing like a worm on a network, completely erasing victims’ file and
booting systems to render them factually unusable.

Skipper

A Blue Python implant that acts as a first-stage profiling tool to gather victims’
information, which is then used to then deploy other, more powerful tools such as
the Snake backdoor.

Spoof

To spoof an email account, domain, or entity is to imitate it, with the aim to deceive a
victim as to the account, domain, or entity’s legitimacy (trustworthiness) and identity.

Stonedrill

A disk wiping malware also called SHAPESHIFT, Stonedrill also contains espionage
tools indicating the destructive malware serves multiple purpose.

Supply chain attack

Attacks in which threat actors seek ways to exploit computer networks via the
privileged access given to third-party suppliers, using them as entry points into
targeted entities. Supply chain attacks can involve compromising software or
hardware providers, and creating malicious versions of the products.

Threat actor

A malicious entity responsible for an intrusion attempt (successful or unsuccessful),
which can be motivated by factors including a desire to steal confidential data,
commit financial fraud, disrupt or destroy a system or cause reputational damage.

Threat intelligence

Threat intelligence consists of the analysis and collection of information pertaining to
different malicious cyber threat actors, understanding the techniques they employ
and their targets, so as to better protect a specific organisation given the particular
threats it faces.

Topinambour

Blue Python dropper malware written in .Net, used to deliver malware including the
KopiLuwak JavaScript backdoor to victims.

TrickBot

First seen in 2016, TrickBot is a modular banking trojan and credential stealer
designed to steal banking and other online account details. It is often delivered after
an initial Emotet infection. PwC assesses that one core threat actor is in charge of
the overall TrickBot system, with sub botnets that are configured to individual
requirements for ‘clients’.

Trojanised (program)

The term refers to a trusted legitimate program that has been altered or tampered
with by a threat actor to hide malware in transit and deliver it to targets, or to perform
malicious functionality on victim systems.

UAC

User Account Control (UAC) is a Windows component that makes applications and
tasks run in a context with non-administrative privileges on a system. It is meant to
prevent inadvertent system changes caused by a standard user, and to impede
malware from taking system administrator-level actions.

UAC bypass

The term ‘UAC bypass’ refers to any measure that leads a program (including, but
not exclusively, malware) to elevate its system privileges, and take actions normally
reserved for system administrators even if the signed-in user does not have
administrator rights.

Vishing

Short for ‘voice phishing’, it consists of an attacker attenmpting to socially engineer
a victim over a phone call, to discover more information about them or convince
them to perform certain actions (for example, unwittingly installing malware).

Watering hole

Also referred to as strategic web compromises, a watering hole attack is a method of
infiltration. A threat actor will compromise a specific trusted website and use this to
infect visitors to the site.

WhiteShadow

A macro-based downloader malware attributed to Green Havildar, that uses SQL
queries to download a payload (which can be CrimsonRAT or commodity RATs like
AzoRULT) to the infected machine from a remote server.

Winnti backdoor

A backdoor first identified in 2011, Winnti has been used by multiple threat actors
collectively known as the ‘Winnti’ metagroup. Used as a backdoor implant as well as
a first pivot point to further compromise victim environments, Winnti has been
deployed against numerous targets: from gaming companies and commercial
organisations to telecommunication companies and dissident communities.

ZeroCleare

A new wiper malware family disclosed in late 2019, ZeroCleare has links to Shamoon
malware and was also deployed against targets in the Middle East.
