Go back

China-based threat actors have persistently targeted the telecommunications sector for
many years. In this talk, PwC Threat Intelligence (PwC TI) analysts will share their research
and present on case studies for several China-based threats currently targeting telcos
prolifically, including well-known threats such as GALLIUM, who PwC tracks as Red Dev 4,
and lesser-known threat actors which have never been publicly disclosed before.
Specifically, Will and Ben will discuss some of the common tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) these adversaries are using to compromise telcos, including some of
their vulnerability preferences, and the strategic backdrop and objectives motivating this
targeting.
Introduction

We’ll begin by briefly setting the scene, with a discussion of the China-based threat
landscape more broadly, particularly as it relates to telecommunications. This will include
discussion of some of the wider targeting we’ve seen previously.
Red Dev 4 / GALLIUM

Next, we’ll discuss a specific example: Red Dev 4 (a.k.a. GALLIUM) is a China-based threat
actor which has compromised telecommunications entities globally. There has been no
public reporting on GALLIUM since 2019, however, we assess that it remains active as of at
least March 2022.
We will discuss some of the recent techniques we’ve seen Red Dev 4 use to maintain
footholds within victim environments, such as the delivery of SoftEther VPN clients
configured to connect to threat actor-owned infrastructure. This will allow us to demonstrate
techniques to track similar activity, and to discover victims in network telemetry. We will also
reference SoftEther configuration files submitted to an online multi-antivirus scanner by
victims, the contained log files of which have assisted in identifying further malicious activity
in victim networks.
Lastly, we will reference victimology and demonstrate how this reflects geopolitical activities
and therefore suggests the targeting aligns with China’s strategic aims.
Red Menshen

1/3

Next, we’ll introduce a threat actor we track as Red Menshen. We first discovered this actor
in 2021, when we detected a sample of a Linux backdoor we track as BPFDoor. We will
briefly highlight some of the functionality of BPFDoor, and the ways in which Red Menshen
uses it to maintain stealthy persistence and move laterally within victim environments..
Based on this analysis, we were able to identify victims in the telecommunications,
government, and education sectors throughout Asia.
By analyzing network telemetry related to the victims we discovered, we were able to
discover recent Red Menshen infrastructure, and to uncover the threat actor’s upstream
infrastructure. This led to the discovery of the suspected compromise of several hundred
routers in Taiwan, which are used as proxies in order to access threat actor infrastructure
and browse to websites.
Conclusions

We will conclude by discussing the wider motivations of China’s ongoing exploitation of
telecommunications providers. This spans a wide range, from targeting information on
specific subscribers, to potentially developing access to core networks which can later be
exploited for intelligence value. We assess that it is highly likely that telecommunications
organisations will remain a key target for China-based threat actors. ***** ##### Attendee
takeaways 1. The talk will advance public knowledge of nation-state cyber threats against
the telecommunications industry worldwide.
1. We will share in-depth threat intelligence about sophisticated nation state threat actors
that has not been publicly disclosed before, including their techniques and targeting.
2. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of how to identify, and defend against,
these threat actors’ operations and how to better secure their environments against
compromise.
