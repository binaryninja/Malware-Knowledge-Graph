Description

This file is a 64-bit Windows executable contained within the Windows MSI Installer "UnionCryptoTrader.msi." When executed, "UnionCryptoUpda
as a service, which will automatically start when any user logs on. The service is installed with a description stating it “Automatically installs updat
Trader."
After installing the service, "UnionCryptoUpdater.exe" collects different information about the system the malware is running on. Specifically, it use
Instrumentation (WMI) Query Language (WQL) to collect this information. "UnionCryptoUpdater.exe" first finds the BIOS Serial Number by using t
Win32_Bios” WMI filter as a WQL Query String (Figure 4).
This returns SMBBIOSBIOSVersion, Manufacturer, Name, SerialNumber, and Version. The function later pulls the “SerialNumber” from this return
The same process is followed to pull the operating system version and build number. The WQL Query String is “SELECT * FROM Win32_Operati
fields pulled are “Caption” and “BuildNumber." Note that the “Caption” field contains the OS version for the computer running the malware.
After collecting the system data, "UnionCryptoUpdater.exe" then builds a string consisting of the current time and the hard-coded value “12GWAP
current time is stored in the "auth_timestamp" variable.
This combined string is MD5 hashed and stored in the "auth_signature" variable. These variables are sent in the first communication to the comm
server, and are likely used to verify any connections to the server are actually originating from the "UnionCryptoUpdater.exe" malware.
These variables are sent via a POST the C2 hxxps[:]//unioncrypto.vip/update along with the collected system data. The system data is sent in this
--Begin format-rlz=[BIOS serial number]&ei=[OS Version] (BuildNumber)&act=check
--End format-These values, along with a hard-coded User Agent String of “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Geck
Chrome/75.0.3770.142 Safari/537.36” can be found in the malware data section.
If the POST is successful (i.e. returns an HTTP response status code of 200), but returns a string of “0”, UnionCryptoUpdater.exe will sleep for ten
regenerate the "auth_timestamp" and "auth_signature" to contact the C2 again.
If the POST is successful and the C2 server does not return the string “0”, the malware will decode the base64 payload and decrypt it. It then uses
allocate memory, write the payload to memory, and executes the payload. If this is successful, the malware will send another POST to the C2 with
replacing the “act=check” for the previously specified format (Figure 9).

Description

This file is a 64-bit dynamic-link library (DLL). This file was identified as a payload for the Windows malware. This stage 2 is not immediately down
"UnionCryptoUpdater.exe," but instead is downloaded after a period of time likely specified by the C2 server at "hxxps[:]//unioncrypto.vip/update."
implemented to prevent researchers from immediately obtaining the stage 2 malware.
The C2 and build path are visible from the "NodeDLL.dll" strings. The C2 for the malware is hxxp[:]//216.189.150.185:8080/push.jsp.
The build path found in the strings is “Z:\Opal\bin\x64_Release\NodeDll.pdb." This stage 2 is likely part of a project named “Opal” by the actors, d

Description

This OSX sample was contained within Apple DMG Installer "UnionCryptoTrader.dmg." This malware is signed adhoc, meaning it is not signed wi

When executed, unioncryptoupdater immediately calls the “onRun()” function, which contains most of the logic and functionality for this malware. T

The function then collects the operating system version by reading the system file at “/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist," and spe

After collecting the system data, unioncryptoupdater then builds a string consisting of the current time and the hard-coded value “12GWAPCT1F0

If the C2 server returns the string “0," unioncryptotrader will sleep for ten minutes and then regenerate the auth_timestamp and auth_signature to

If the C2 server does not return the string “0," the malware will decode the base64 payload, and decrypt it using the C++ aes_decrypt_cbc functio
