Introduction
Welcome to the new subscribers of the Anchored Narratives mailing list. For those new to
the list, I regularly pick an exciting tweet that matched my intelligence requirements and
generated anchored stories on geopolitical (cyber) threats, digital forensics, and crime from
that. Usually, I pick a story that I have no real in-depth or prior knowledge about. The goal is
to understand a particular topic better, improve my investigation or writing skills, and
generate a reliable story anchored with evidence that can be verified or challenged.
I have not been writing any stories lately as I started a great new job in September. I’m also
working in incident response (IR) again with a lot of memory forensics! Awesome how
Volexity has taken that field to the next level with a robust memory acquisition capability
called Surge and a Volcano’s memory analysis platform. I participated with the great George
Garner Jr1., who unfortunately passed away in 2017, in a memory forensics challenge in
2005 where no software existed to analyze memory dumps.
But unbelievable how Volexity improved the acquisition and analysis piece with their
products. However, they are commercial tools. I can only recommend them as they will
provide you valuable insights into the State of a machine (integrity) in a certain period and
decrease your root cause analysis time for breaches. The amount of forensic reconstruction
from a collected memory sample the software can do is just something I have not
experienced before. We are even able to recover the entire exploit chains and backdoors
executed by threat actors from memory. Just awesome.
But now, back to a new anchored narrative about a threat actor covered in the earlier
monthly threat actor overviews of June and September, namely TransparentTribe.
With the revival of the Taliban in Afghanistan also geopolitical tensions in the neighboring
countries changed drastically. What does this revival mean for China, India, and Pakistan? In
this article, the nation-state actor, TransparentTribe matched my Twitter threat intelligence
requirements 71 times since the beginning of this year. The threat-actor is likely originating
from Pakistan and also linked to attacks on the critical infrastructure of India. Here we go!

Background TransparentTribe
In 2016 Proofpoint released a report “Operation TransparentTribe’ of a nation-state threat
actor targeting India’s embassy staff in Saudi Arabia and Kazakstan via phishing attacks.
Their research also unraveled attacks against Indian diplomatic and military resources via
so-called watering holes attacks. A watering hole attack is a technique that hackers employ

2/15

to compromise a popular website and infect its visitors with malware once they visit that
infected website. Proofpoint then dubbed their malware as “MSIL/Crimson”, which later
became known as CrimsonRat.
By 2017 CysInfo, shared an in-depth story about a threat actor who was impersonating the
identity of an Indian Think Tank to Target the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and
Possibly Indian Army Officials. The registration information of the domains was traced back
to a Pakistani telephone number and an IP address from Pakistan. The story’s author, known
malware researcher, Monnappa K A, did not attribute it to TransparentTribe. However, his
analysis was referenced in the Threat Actor Encyclopedia and attributed to the same group
there.
In 2020 Kaspersky shared interesting research about the CrimsonRat Server component
they detected and that the actor group targeted victims in Afghanistan and India.

Figure 1: .Net Server component of CrimsonRat, reported by Kaspersky
CrimsonRat provides the espionage group with the following capabilities on the infected
systems:
manage remote filesystems
upload or download files
capture screenshots
perform audio surveillance using microphones
record video streams from webcam devices
capture screenshots
steal files from removable media
execute arbitrary commands
record keystrokes
steal passwords saved in browsers

spread across systems by infecting removable media

Figure 2: Collection of relevant files on

infected systems via USB worm
Kaspersky detected hundreds of victims, but infection also occurred through a USB-Worm
component of CrimsonRat. Kaspersky found an Android piece of malware to spy on mobile
phones and a link between ObliqueRAT and Transparent Tribe in their second part. The
group mimicked a known COVID tracking app.
In April 2021 and July 2021, Team Cymru released part 1 and part 2 of their analysis that
focused on the infrastructure leveraged by the TransparentTribe group. It highlighted the
following findings:
1. C2s are hosted with several VPS providers – most commonly Contabo, ColoCrossing,
Pi Net, and QuadraNet.
2. Port 3389 was observed open on 83% of the CrimsonRAT C2 servers.
3. An RDP certificate serves as a key indicator for CrimsonRAT and has been observed
on 17 C2 servers in total.
4. Analysis of C2 servers showed beaconing from victims who were primarily located in
the Kashmir region.

In July 2021, the Hindu media outlet reported that TransparentTribe was targeting critical
Indian infrastructure of public enterprises, according to a report by Seqrite. In their report,
Seqrite mentions the group was “targeting critical Indian organizations”. The report explains
that TransparentTribe mimicked the behavior of an Indian nation-state actor group named
Sidewinder. Their analysis demonstrates that VPS provider Contabo in Germany hosts the
CrimsonRat infrastructure. In addition, some of the domains used for their operations were
registered to someone in Pakistan with the e-mail address “kingsmanfisher@gmail.com”.
In September 2021, Cyble shared research finding TransparentTribe malware that targeted
the Indian Armed forces staff. Additionally, they found an icon loaded by the malicious app,
which is the logo of the Canteen Store Department (CSD).

Lastly, in September 2021, Weibu online shared their insights in a threat intelligence report
with relevant indicators of compromise (translated) called “Trilateral operations: years of
cyber espionage against many countries in South Asia and the Middle East”. They captured
several APT attacks against Iran, Afghanistan, and India, all parties that signed the
“Chabahar Port Agreement”. In the report, Weibu lists a malicious document called
“Chabahar Port Agreement (Trilateral) in Iran.doc”, which they observed in the attack
uploaded to VirusTotal March 2021. The victims were targeted via phishing, watering holes
or backdoored software, or malicious Android packages.
Weibu further explains the geopolitical significance of the Chabahar port. “Chabahar Port is
the global oil and gas center on the coast of the Persian Gulf to the west, and leads to the
oil-rich Central Asian countries to the north. It is right at the intersection of West Asia, South
Asia, Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. Geographical transportation is extremely important.
“
The agreement is crucial to India as this will provide them strategic access to Iran, and it can
bypass Pakistan in transporting goods to Afghanistan. Still, it is also vital to counter the
Chinese (naval) presence in the Arabian Sea, where China supports Pakistan to develop the
Gwadar Port, which is nearby, namely 100 kilometers by sea.
The city of Chabahar is also an important military site for Iran’s navy and air force. In
addition, Iran has many large iron mines, giant copper mines, and rich oil and gas resources.
The threat actor responsible for the attack overlaps to a certain degree with the
TransparentTribe group, and they are likely to have a Pakistani background, claimed by
Weibu.

Reversing their latest malware
On the 24th of September 2021 malware researcher, at Malwarebytes Jazi (@h2jazi) shared
the following TransparentTribe intelligence. Interestingly, the actors mimicked the original
Iranian website “https://www.tasnimnews.com” website as their C2 server.

I will briefly assess the malicious document and CrimsonRat backdoor to determine if new
developments can be spotted. Let’s start with the malicious document.
Nakul Kumar.doc 59ed41388826fed419cc3b18d28707491a4fa51309935c4fa016e53c6f2f94bc

First, the file type was determined with the file command. This revealed the following
information:
59ed41388826fed419cc3b18d28707491a4fa51309935c4fa016e53c6f2f94bc: Composite Document
File V2 Document, Little Endian, Os: Windows, Version 10.0, Code page: 1252, Author:
Chinto, Template: Normal.dotm, Last Saved By: Allen Murphy, Revision Number: 17, Name

Time/Date: Tue Sep 21 07:52:00 2021, Last Saved Time/Date: Tue Sep 21 10:00:00 2021,
Number of Pages: 1, Number of Words: 0, Number of Characters: 1, Security: 0

The file command revealed some interesting metadata. The next step was to inspect the
documents for the presence of malicious macros. With the famous oletools, it was possible
to retrieve all the Visual Basic for Application (VBA) macro’s in the document.
askfjlskdjflkjsdrkljskd = Split(UserForm1.TextBox1.Text & UserForm1.TextBox2.Text &
UserForm1.TextBox3.Text & UserForm1.TextBox4.Text, "!")
Dim lskjfjiogjnvdfgljwlfjfsf As Double
lskjfjiogjnvdfgljwlfjfsf = 0
For Each tiogjvelrrkjf In askfjlskdjflkjsdrkljskd
ReDim Preserve alksdjweoijgskljsl_____(lskjfjiogjnvdfgljwlfjfsf)
alksdjweoijgskljsl_____(lskjfjiogjnvdfgljwlfjfsf) = CByte(tiogjvelrrkjf)
lskjfjiogjnvdfgljwlfjfsf = lskjfjiogjnvdfgljwlfjfsf + 1
VBA FORM STRING IN '59ed41388826fed419cc3b18d28707491a4fa51309935c4fa016e53c6f2f94bc'
- OLE stream: 'Macros/UserForm1/o'
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 20!163!163!232!71!161!103!90!143!154!72!231!144!84!104!72!25!253!146!69!107!219!79!95!

Being familiar with their malicious documents, it appears that the actor is starting to use
random names for variables and functions, but take note that the actor is still using the
Split(UserForm1.Textbox1) where the decimal content is separated by “!”. The same
technique has been observed in the analysis of Monnappa K A in 2017 and displayed in the
screenshot below.

8/15

Figure 5: Similar

methods observed in research from 2017
By extracting the decimal content from the malicious document and storing it in a text file, the
CrimsonRat backdoor named “winword.exe” could be extracted by the following Python
program. I could not enter the program in the code section of Substack as this produced an
error, hence the screenshot.

Figure 6: Sample program to convert the decimal content into binary
To determine if the data has been converted correctly, the executable is calculated with
sha256sum.
$ sha256sum winword.exe
afd21ef5712ffcbe4e338a5eb347f742d3c786f985ba003434568146adedb290

9/15

The value corresponds with the data that Jazi, the malware researcher, shared. The file
command was used again to determine if the executable is indeed a .Net piece of malware.
$ file winword.exe
winword.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows

The file command provides insights that the malware is a .Net executable with loads in
DnSpy, but first, the executable was investigated with ClamAV, the open-source anti-virus
scanner. I’m a massive fan of that project as it is fast, and you can build your custom
signatures with it. I have used it in the past to detect malicious backdoors on forensic images
of multiple servers that were part of a significant forensic investigation.
$ clamscan winword.exe
winword.exe: Win.Trojan.CrimsonRAT-7591455-0 FOUND

ClamAV still detects this latest CrimsonRat. If you want to understand which patterns the
malware got detected, you could leverage the power of sigtool. With the sigtool, you can
display the signatures and decode the decimal and compressed values stored in the ClamAV
databases. This method can also get a better insight into how actors develop their malware
and obtain better intelligence on them.
$ sigtool --find-sigs Win.Trojan.CrimsonRAT-7591455-0
[daily.ldb] Win.Trojan.CrimsonRAT-7591455-0;Engine:51-255,Target:1;(0|

The -decode-sigs argument can decode the signatures of ClamAV.

10/15

$ sigtool --find-sigs Win.Trojan.CrimsonRAT-7591455-0 |sigtool --decode-sigs
VIRUS NAME: Win.Trojan.CrimsonRAT-7591455-0
<cut for brevity>
thnaviwa\thnaviwa\obj\Debug\thnaviwa.pdb
pull_data
do_process
IPSConfig
_responce>b__
see_responce
funStarter
<cut for brevity>

I have removed other information for readability, but ClamAV detected the CrimsonRat
sample as it encountered more than 3 of the strings like “pull_data” or “do_process” in the
sample. This can be verified by executing the strings and grep on the “winword.exe” sample.
$ strings -a winword.exe |grep -iE "
(pull_data|do_process|_responce>b__|see_responce|funStarter|thnaviwa.pdb)"
gitfunStarter
gitsee_responce
gitpull_data
gitdo_process

The sample contained four matches with the signatures stored in the ClamAV database’
daily.ldb’. By loading the CrimsonRat (winword.exe) in dnSpy, you can view the code of the
CrimsonRat, but also see some of the matching strings on the left. From this sample is also
appears that the author of the CrimsonRat is obfuscating the code better than observed in
earlier samples.

Conclusion
The TransparentTribe actor seems very busy, is not stealthy, and anti-virus solutions have
proper detections. The actor is observed in different regions in Asia and attacking multiple
countries in the area, but primarily India and Afghanistan. The main attack vectors that the
group employs are still phishing, watering hole attacks, or backdoored downloads. There
appears to be a broad consensus among malware security researchers that the nation-state
actor originates from Pakistan. The latest samples demonstrate that the actor is trying to
obfuscate the malware by applying random names to functions and variables in the malicious
documents and the CrimsonRat, thus far not with a lot of success. The actor also has
capabilities the target victims on the Android platform.
Although mentioned in some research, I could not observe that TransperentTribe was
attacking critical infrastructure in India. Still, from a nation-state perspective, you likely want
to gain a strategic foothold in the crucial infrastructure networks of your enemy.
Many security companies have shared research on TransparentTribe. Still, Weibo shared the
fascinating geopolitical angle that I was unfamiliar with, namely one of significant strategic
importance towards countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative in the Middle East and Asia
by India. They reported an attack on Iran, India, and Afghanistan with a theme of the trilateral
agreement of the port of Chahabar in Iran. Until next time, where the indicators will direct me
in writing the subsequent anchored narrative. Likely on another nation-state operating in the
South Asia region.

Appendix: TransparentTribe IOC’s since January 2021
The following IOC’s were shared on Twitter by many malware researchers since the
beginning of January 2021. Sharing is caring. Keep doing that! The list below matched my
intelligence requirements multiple times but is not complete. The format of sharing that is the
most used by security researchers is the following:
#APT #APTGroupname
MD5 Maldoc:MD5 Value
Filename:Filename
Backdoor Name:MD5 value
ITW:MD5 value
Filename:Filename
Download from:Second stage payload location
C2: IP-address
Domain name: DNS name
Any other interesting artifacts: DBG path

Based upon the above information, the data listed below matched the search criteria. Of
course, I have not reviewed all samples or confirmed them to belong to that the
TransparentTribe group definitely, but it is very likely.
