November 1, 2018

Trickbot, which used to be a simple banking trojan, has come a long way. Over time, we’ve
seen how cybercriminals continue to add more features to this malware. Last March, Trickbot
added a new module that gave it increased detection evasion and a screen-locking feature.
This month, we saw that Trickbot (detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_TRICKBOT.THOIBEAI)
now has a password grabber module (pwgrab32) that steals access from several
applications and browsers, such as Microsoft Outlook, Filezilla, WinSCP, Google Chrome,
Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. Based on our telemetry, we saw that
this Trickbot variant has affected users mainly in the United States, Canada, and the
Philippines.
Analyzing Trickbot’s modules
Malware authors continue to cash in on Trickbot’s modular structure — its ability to
continually update itself by downloading new modules from a C&C server and change its
configuration make for a malware that’s ripe for updating. To gain a better understanding of
this threat, we analyzed Trickbot’s different modules, starting with the new pwgrab32 module
that we saw this month.
pwgrab32 module

1/7

Trickbot’s new module, called pwgrab32 or PasswordGrabber, steals credentials from
applications such as Filezilla, Microsoft Outlook, and WinSCP.

Aside from stealing credentials from applications, it also steals the following information from
several popular web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer,
and Microsoft Edge:
Usernames and Passwords
Internet Cookies
Browsing History
Autofills
HTTP Posts

popular web browsers
It should be noted that this Trickbot variant is not capable of stealing passwords from thirdparty password manager applications. We are studying this malware further to see if it is able
to steal passwords from password managers that have browser plugins.
shareDll32 module
Trickbot uses the shareDll32 module to help propagate itself throughout the network. It
connects to a C&C server http[:]//185[.]251[.]39[.]251/radiance[.]png to download a copy of
itself and save it as setuplog.tmp.

copy of itself

The shareDll32 module then enumerates and identifies systems connected on the same
domain using WNetEnumResource and GetComputerNameW.

WNetEnumResourceW and GetComputerNameW
The file setuplog.tmp is then copied in the administrative shares of the discovered machines
or systems.

To make the malware more persistent, it has an auto-start service that allows Trickbot to run
whenever the machine boots. This service can have the following display names:
Service Techno
Service_Techno2
Technics-service2
Technoservices
Advanced-Technic-Service
ServiceTechno5

wormDll module

The wormDll32 module attempts to identify servers and domain controllers in the network
using NetServerEnum and LDAP queries. Trickbot’s worm-like propagation capability was
first observed by security researchers from Flashpoint in 2017.

in a network using LDAP queries
We also discovered that there is a possible SMB protocol implementation using “pysmb,”
utilizing the NT LM 0.12 query for older Windows operating systems and IPC shares. It
should be noted that this function seems to still be in development.

networkDll32
Trickbot uses this encrypted module to scan the network and steal relevant network
information. It executes the following commands to gather information on the infected
system:

network information
Wormdll32 module
Wormdll32 is an encrypted module that Trickbot uses to propagate itself via SMB and LDAP
queries. It is used together with the module “wormDll” to propagate across the network.
importDll32 module
This module is responsible for stealing browser data such as browsing history, cookies, and
plug-ins, among others.
systeminfo32 module
Once successfully installed in a system, Trickbot will gather system information such as OS,
CPU, and memory information, user accounts, lists of installed programs and services.
mailsearcher32 module
This module searches the infected system’s files to gather email addresses for informationstealing purposes. Collecting email addresses for spam campaign-related needs is usual
malware behavior, however, Kryptos Research recently reported that the Emotet banking
trojan doesn't just steal email addresses; it also harvests emails sent and received via
Microsoft Outlook on an Emotet-infected device. Emotet, according to previous research by
Brad Duncan, is also responsible for delivering this password-grabbing Trickbot variant, as
well as Azorult, to users.
injectDll32 module
4/7

This encrypted module monitors websites that banking applications might use. It's also used
to inject code into its target processes using the Reflective DLL Injection technique.
The injectDll32 monitors banking-related websites for two different credential-stealing
methods:
First, when a user logs in to any of the monitored banking websites on its list such as Chase,
Citi, Bank of America, Sparda-Bank, Santander, HSBC, Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (CIBC), and Metrobank, Trickbot will then send a POST response to the C&C
server to extract the user’s login credentials.
Second, Trickbot monitors if a user accesses certain banking-related websites on its list,
such as C. Hoare & Co bank, St. James’s Place Bank, and Royal Bank of Scotland, and will
redirect users to fake phishing websites.
The banking URLs Trickbot monitors include websites from the United States, Canada, UK,
Germany, Australia, Austria, Ireland, London, Switzerland, and Scotland.
Trickbot’s other notable tricks
Trickbot is usually sent via malicious spam campaigns. The malware disables Microsoft’s
built-in antivirus Windows Defender by executing certain commands and modifying registry
entries. Additionally, it also terminates Windows Defender-related processes such as
MSASCuil.exe, MSASCui.exe, and antispyware utility Msmpeng.exe. It also has an autostart
mechanism (Msntcs) that is triggered at system startup and every ten minutes after it is first
executed.
It disables the following anti-malware services:
MBamService (Malwarebytes-related Process)
SAVService (Sophos AV-related process)

Its anti-analysis capability checks the system and terminates itself when it finds certain
modules, such as pstorec.dll, vmcheck.dll, wpespy.dll, and dbghelp.dll.
