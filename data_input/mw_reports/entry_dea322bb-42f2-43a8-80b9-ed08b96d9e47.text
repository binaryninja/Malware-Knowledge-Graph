Ransomware Roundup: LockBit, BlueSky, and More
fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-new-variants
July 18, 2022

Over the past few weeks, FortiGuard Labs has observed several new ransomware variants
of interest that have been gaining traction within the OSINT community along with activity
from our datasets. This isn’t new. This same thing has been going on, week in and week out,
for years, with very little changing.
Unfortunately, ransomware is here to stay. Ransomware infections continue to cause
significant impact to organizations, including—but not limited to—disruptions to operations,
theft of confidential information, monetary loss due to ransom payout, and more. It’s why we
feel it's imperative that we increase our efforts to raise awareness about existing and
emerging ransomware variants.
This new Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the
evolving ransomware landscape, along with the Fortinet solutions that protect against these
variants.

This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the LockBit, BlueSky, Deno,
RedAlert, Dark Web Hacker, Hive, and Again ransomware.

LockBit Ransomware
LockBit is a ransomware strain that targets both Windows and Linux. It has been in the wild
since December 2019. This ransomware employs a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
model. Ransomware operators develop LockBit ransomware and all the necessary tools and
infrastructure to support it, such as leak sites and ransom payment portals. They offer these
solutions, along with user support, to their affiliates (criminals who pay a fee to use their
technology). Support is provided via TOX (a RaaS framework). They also offer additional
services, such as ransom negotiation, for affiliates.
LockBit affiliates carry out the actual attacks that infect and deploy ransomware to targets
and, in return, receive 20% of the ransom paid by victims. While rules prohibit affiliates from
encrypting files in critical infrastructure environments, such as nuclear power plants or gas
and oil industries, affiliates are allowed to steal data without encrypting critical files and or the
infrastructure of these organizations. In addition, former Soviet countries (Armenia, Belarus,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Estonia) are off-limits from attack.

Prior to file encryption, data on victim machines is exfiltrated using “StealBit,” an information
stealer tool developed by the LockBit gang. Files encrypted by the ransomware typically
have a “.lockbit” file extension. The ransomware also leaves a ransom note in Restore-MyFiles.txt.
Some variants of LockBit also replace desktop wallpaper with a message to let victims know
that they are a victim of the ransomware, asking them to check the ransom note for how to
reach out to the LockBit threat actor. LockBit employs a double-extortion tactic that demands
victims pay their ransom in Bitcoin to recover affected files and not have stolen information
leaked to the public.
LockBit 3.0 debuted in March 2022 as a successor to LockBit 2.0. The ransomware made
the news again at the end of June because the ransomware gang introduced a “bug bounty”
program with rewards of between $1000 and $1,000,000 (USD) for detecting flaws and
weaknesses in its portfolio.

BlueSky Ransomware
BlueSky is a recently discovered ransomware variant, with some BlueSky ransomware
samples distributed online as “MarketShere.exe” and “SecurityUpdate.exe.” BlueSky
encrypts files on a compromised machine and then adds a “.bluesky” file extension. It then
drops a ransom note in “# DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.txt“and “# DECRYPT FILES
BLUESKY #.html,” in which victims are asked to visit a BlueSky TOR site and follow provided
instructions.

Deno Ransomware
Deno is a new ransomware variant that encrypts files on a compromised machine and adds
a “.DENO” file extension to targeted files. It then drops a ransom note in “readme.txt” which
provides two ProtonMail email addresses for victims to contact the attacker to recover
affected files. Interestingly enough, there is no information on how much this will cost and if
payment is what the threat actor is ultimately after.

RedAlert
RedAlert, also known as N13V, is a new ransomware discovered in early July. It affects
Windows and Linux VMWare (ESXi) servers. It encrypts files on the compromised machine
and steals data from it. One reported file extension that this ransomware variant adds to
affected files is “.crypt658”, but this may change depending on the victim.
This ransomware uses a double-extortion tactic, which demands a ransom payment to
recover affected files and prevents the release of stolen data to its data leak site for anyone
to download. To pressure victims into paying a ransom, the authors also ask the victim to
contact the attacker within 72 hours, or else the threat actor will publish part of the stolen
data to their leak site. Additional threats include launching Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attacks against the victim and making phone calls to the victim’s employees as a
shame tactic.

Dark Web Hacker
Dark Web Hacker is another recently discovered ransomware. It encrypts files on a
compromised machine and appends ".[4 random characters}” to target files and the end of
the file name. It also leaves a ransom note in “read_it.txt” containing an attacker’s contact
email address and Bitcoin address. Ransom demand is $3,000 worth of Bitcoin.
Figure 4. Ransom note
The ransomware also replaces any desktop wallpaper with its own wallpaper that includes a
Bitcoin QR code to “help” victims to pay a ransom.
The ransomware also deletes shadow copies, which makes file recovery difficult.

Hive
Hive ransomware is another Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) that attempts to encrypt files
on victims’ machines, steal data, and demand a payment to recover affected files and
prevent stolen data from being published to their data leak site, called “HiveLeaks," on the
DarkWeb. This ransomware notoriously affected Costa Rica's public health system, which
was reportedly disrupted by the ransomware.
The latest iterations are written in the Rust programing language. Older variants are written
in Go.
Decryptor Tool Now Available
On July 13th, security researcher @reecDeep released a v5 keystream decryptor tool for
Hive ransomware. The tool can be found on @reecDeep’s Github page.

FortiGuard Labs previously released a Threat Signal for Hive ransomware report. For

What is ‘Again’ ransomware?
The Again ransomware is another new ransomware variant that seems to have its origins in
Babuk. It appears to share the same source code as Babuk (which had its entire source
code leaked in 2021) and can safely be considered a fork of that variant. The Again
ransomware seeks out files to encrypt and appends “.again” to the filename, rendering them
inoperable.
Victims are presented with a text file entitled “How To Restore Your Files.txt." It contains
information on contacting the bad actor(s) behind the ransomware using a predefined TOR
website. On this site, the page has a submit message page to the ransom actor, who will
likely seek something in return from the victim in exchange for their files.

Best practices include not paying a ransom
Victims of ransomware are cautioned against paying ransom by organizations such as CISA,
NCSC, the FBI, and HHS, partly because payment does not guarantee files will be
recovered. Ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional
organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit
activities that could potentially be illegal, according to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office
of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory. The FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page,
where victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via the Internet Crimes Complaint
Center (IC3).
