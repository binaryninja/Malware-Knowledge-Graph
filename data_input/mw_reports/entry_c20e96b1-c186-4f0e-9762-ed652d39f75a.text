A new Ransomware strain spread by malicious Office documents targeted at Croatian
systems - let's check it out

This strain was first discovered by Korben Dallas on Twitter on the 9th of January. As I
already mentioned the Malware is delivered via a Malspam/Maldoc attack crafted for Users /
Companies from Croatia. Researchers that were involved in the initial analysis:
@KorbenD_Intel, @James_inthe_box, @Malwageddon, @pollo290987 and I (@f0wlsec).
Thank you for your contributions!

A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below
will lead to the encryption of your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check
with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources might be illegal depending
on where you live.

Here you can see three images extracted from the malicious Excel Docs. Funny how they
didn't even bother to think of a fake company name for the second Logo :D

Afrodita uses a sleep routine for Sandbox evasion. In my Tests it took 30-60mins until the
system was infected.

After unpacking the sample with UPX, Detect it easy returns the following:

2/9

It was likely build with a very new Version

of Visual Studio (2019)

Below you can see a screenshot of PEBear from the Imports-Tab.

The extracted strings tell us quite a lot in this case. It looks like the internal name of the
Project is Afrodita and it utilizes the CryptoPP Library. There are some references to .key
files, but I haven't found a path or file on a infected machine yet. README_RECOVERY .txt
is will be the filename of the Ransomnote. It's contents are embeded in the binary's .data
section with Base64 encoding. Lastly Afrodita.dll is the rewritten file that is downloaded as a
payload (originally notnice.jpg or verynice.jpg). It's executed via rundll32.exe
Afrodita.dll,Sura.

The following filetypes will be encrypted by Afrodita:

The Ransomware encrypts the first 512 Bytes of the File Header which will render most
filetypes useless. It does not leave any Signature in the data of the files and neither does it
append a custom extension to the filename.

Update 10.01.2020:
The criminals obviously failed to properly display the key / victim ID in the Ransomnote. This
was also a problem because the screwed encoding killed this Blogs Atom RSS Feed :D To
resolve this issue I removed the malformed section from this page. If you want to have a look
at the original note plus a couple of encrypted jpegs, download the zip file.
Also this Malware family isn't as new as I originally thought. According to Michael Gillespie
the MalwareHunterTeam found the first Maldoc in Late November. A few days later
Checkpoint research found it as well:
#Afrodita Ransomware, appears to be a new strain.
Targeting businesses in Croatia via legitimate looking Excel spreadsheets.

Today Michael also asked if anyone was able to parse the main-public.key because the
format seems off. I extracted it from the binary:

A quick look into the CryptoPP Wiki revealed that the key was in raw (uncooked) ASN.1
format (you can identify it by hex 30 82). Using an online ASN.1 decoder (Link) yields us the
public key:
