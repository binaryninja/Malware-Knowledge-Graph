China-linked TA428 Continues to Target Russia and
Mongolia IT
recordedfuture.com/china-linked-ta428-threat-group

Insikt Group
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group recently identified renewed activity attributed to the
suspected Chinese threat activity group TA428. The identified activity overlaps with a TA428
campaign previously reported by Proofpoint as “Operation LagTime IT”, which targeted
Russian and East Asian government information technology agencies in 2019. Based on the
infrastructure, tactics, and victim organization identified, we assess that TA428 likely
continues to engage in intrusion activity targeting organizations in Russia and Mongolia.

Infrastructure and Targeting
On January 21, 2021, Insikt Group detected the PlugX C2 server 103.125.219[.]222 (Hosting
provider: VPSServer[.]com) hosting multiple domains spoofing various Mongolian news
entities. One of the domains, f1news.vzglagtime[.]net, previously appeared in the
aforementioned Proofpoint Operation LagTime IT blog. At the time of the Proofpoint blog
publication in July 2019, the vzglagtime[.]net domain was hosted on 45.76.211[.]18 through
the hosting provider Vultr. According to passive DNS data, this IP address also hosted the
Mongolian-themed domains at the same time, further strengthening the overlaps between
these unreported suspected TA428 domains and Operation LagTime IT activity. The
subdomains appear to spoof familiar news-themed names and words, both in English and in
Mongolian languages. Insikt Group also identified two subdomains in this campaign with the
term “Bloomberg”, a US-based news agency. However, we have no other indication that this
campaign targeted US companies. The subdomains in this campaign used familiar terms to
lure victims into trusting these sites. These unreported domains include the following:
aircraft.tsagagaar[.]com

Tsag agaar (цаг агаар) is a Mongolian word for “weather”

nubia.tsagagaar[.]com

Likely spoofing New Ulaanbaatar International Airport

Malware Analysis
Insikt Group identified multiple Royal Road, Poison Ivy, and PlugX samples communicating
with the newly identified TA428-linked infrastructure. This closely matches previous reporting
by Proofpoint and NTT Security on TA428 activity. In particular, the following PoisonIvy
sample was uploaded to a malware multi-scanning source in December 2020:
15ce51dd036231d1ef106cd499c7539e68b195a5b199150a30aa2ba41d3076fb (filename:
x64.dll)
1145d39ce42761862eeb7c46500b3fc5cd0dcd9c0fed35623b577b01d0ec3c8e (filename:
x86.dll)
The x86.dll is designed for a 32-bit environment and the x64.dll one for a 64-bit environment.
Once executed, the DLL file drops two files: PotPlayerMini.exe, a legitimate executable
vulnerable to DLL hijacking, and PotPlayer.dll, a PoisonIvy payload. PotPlayerMini.exe is
executed to load the malicious PoisonIvy DLL, which in this case is configured to
communicate with the C2 domain nubia.tsagagaar[.]com. This PoisonIvy loading sequence
directly matches TA428 activity described by NTT Security in October 2020. NTT
researchers found that the group used the EternalBlue exploit to move laterally and inject the
initial DLL files into the lsass.exe process on the target host.
Malware Analysis

Insikt Group also identified a malware sandbox upload containing the TA428-linked
PoisonIvy sample seen above alongside an EternalBlue exploit tool, the WinEggDrop port
scanner, and an MS17-010 scanning tool. The presence of file paths within the upload
suggests that the malware was possibly used to target the Russian IT firm ATOL. This
victimology also aligns with Operation Lagtime IT activity previously observed, which
featured targeting of Russian and East Asian government information technology agencies.
Additionally, a blog post by researcher Sebdraven from November 2020 details an additional
Royal Road document sample that he attributes to TA428 as a continuation of Operation
Lagtime IT. The lure document spoofs the sender as Mongolian authorities and refers to the
2/4

conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in order to lure the victim to opening the document.
According to Sebdraven, the file uses Version 7 of Royal Road RTF weaponizer, which
installs a very simple backdoor in memory, rewriting the EQNEDT32.EXE process. After the
backdoor gathers initial information on the target machine’s disk, running processes,
Windows OS version, and user privileges, it attempts to reach out to the command and
control (C2) domain custom.songuulcomiss[.]com, which was hosted on the Malaysian IP
address 103.106.250[.]239 at the time of discovery.

Attacker Profile
TA428 is a China-linked cyber espionage group identified and named by Proofpoint
researchers in 2019, but some overlaps in infrastructure, victimology, and tools indicate that
this group may have been active as far back as 2013. TA428 is believed to use custom tool
sets and targets organizations of high strategic value to China, including but not limited to IT,
scientific research, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, political processes, and financial
development. In February 2021, NTT researchers attributed a new campaign to TA428, this
time targeting East Asian defense and aviation organizations in Russia and Mongolia with a
malware they call nccTrojan, observed between March 2019 and November 2020.
