Diving Deeper Into the Kaseya VSA Attack: REvil Returns and
Other Hackers Are Riding Their Coattails
trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/diving-deeper-into-the-kaseya-vsa-attack-revil-returns-and-other-hackersare-riding-their-coattails/

On, July 2nd, a massive ransomware attack was launched against roughly 60 managed services
providers (MSPs) by criminals associated with the REvil ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group.
The attack leveraged the on-premises servers deployed by IT Management Software vendor
Kaseya. It was initially thought that Kaseya might have been compromised themselves as a root
cause -- similar to the compromises associated with SolarWinds software in December of 2020.
Instead, the attackers found and leveraged an unpatched zero-day vulnerability in Kaseya's VSA
software. At the time of this blog, 1,500 downstream customers of these MSPs have been infected
with ransomware.
This vulnerability has been issued CVE-2021-30116 and was discovered and reported to Kaseya by
a researcher for the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD). A patch was being actively
worked on by Kaseya according to the DIVD, but not finalized prior to REvil discovering and
exploiting the issue. At this point, it is still not clear what the actual issue is or how the exploit may
work, although initial reports suggest a potential authentication bypass. A patch has not been
released, and Kaseya is recommending that customers with on-premises VSA Servers take them
offline until a patch is issued. The REvil group initially demanded $70 million USD to reveal a
universal decryptor for all affected victims but has since lowered the demand to $50 million.

In the past, the REvil group has also exfiltrated data either for sale or to pressure a victim even more
into paying the ransom. This appears to be the case with this campaign as well, as we've seen REvil
call out many customers bragging on their Darknet hosted "Happy Blog" about the amount of data
they have in their possession.

Malware Analysis
Over the course of the weekend, our SpiderLabs Malware Analysis team received a malware
submission from our Global Threat Operations group. They were investigating a piece of DLL file
they found on one of our customer's critical servers hit by a ransomware attack. This server was
running Kaseya VSA. The file is a digitally signed DLL with a file named mpsvc.dll

Figure 5: Digitial signature on mpsvc.dll
Upon initial investigation, the DLL is the payload itself - REvil Ransomware. So we thought to step
back a little bit and investigate how this DLL got loaded. This pointed us to an ongoing discussion
on Reddit. It turns out that this library was side-loaded by a legitimate Microsoft executable
(MsMpEng.exe).
MsMpEng.exe is benign and part of the Microsoft Antimalware service. An older version was used by
the attackers. As you can see in the screenshot below, it shows the properties of this Microsoft
executable and digital signature details.

When MsMpEng.exe runs, it picks up the attacker's "mpsvc.dll" and loads an exported function from
the malicious library called ServiceCrtMain(). This function unpacks and loads the ransomware into
the memory and executes it.
Stepping back, MsMpEng.exe and mpsvc.dll were both installed in the infected system by a dropper
named Agent.exe.
(Virustotal

aec60a4a6978e9f1e/detection)
"Agent.exe" dropper contains two binaries - MsMpEng.exe and mpsvc.dll embedded in its body
(particularly in the resources section), which when executed, writes (with system privilege) both files
into C:\Windows. Agent.exe then executes MsMpEng.exe that eventually loaded the malicious
"mpsvc.dll" file.
"Agent.exe" was initially dropped as a Base64 encoded file – named as "Agent.crt" to the
path C:\kworking. This .crt file was deployed through a malicious update by exploiting Kaseya VSA
servers, and it eventually sent out this update to the Kaseya VSA Agents running on managed
devices. Once the malicious update is deployed to the devices, Kaseya VSA Agents will run a
PowerShell command to decode the .crt file and then execute it.
For the initial vector, Huntress' blog reported that the attacker used an authentication bypass in the
web interface of the Kaseya VSA server to gain an authenticated session. They then uploaded the
payload and execute a command via SQL injection to deploy the malicious updates
To visualize, this is how post-exploitation execution flows:

The Ransomware Payload
The payload was found to be REvil ransomware version 2. We have managed to decode the
ransomware configuration. A decoded copy can be found here. The configuration file itself is
embedded in the ransomware encoded in RC4 with the
key mXT1QFyEUbrxc4cbP84jbN5wrHeqmFXt

The Vultures Circle: Spammers Riding REvil Coattails
Perhaps not surprisingly, spammers have been quick to jump on this issue as a lure in their
malicious emails. Today, we encountered spams claiming that Microsoft issued an update which can
provide protection against the Kaseya's vulnerability. Below is an example.

Figure 11: Phishing Email piggybacking on the REvil attack
Both a malicious link and attachment are contained in the spams. A spoofed link to Kaseya's
webpage https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/, where the updates about CVE2021-30116 are posted, is contained in the email body. Clicking this link will lead to an executable
file being downloaded from hxxp://45[.]153[.]241[.]113/download/pload[.]exe. The downloaded
executable file and the executable attached to the spams are the same file - CobaltStrike malware.

Payload
The executable file loads a Cobalt Strike launcher that unpacks and executes a Cobalt Strike
beacon.dll in memory and creates an encrypted tunnel between the infected host and the
adversaries. Cobalt Strike is a post-exploitation tool that is used for legitimate purposes by network
penetration testers. However, cybercriminals also utilize this tool for malicious purposes to
exfiltrate data from compromised hosts, move laterally within the host's network, and also to act as a
backdoor.
Extracting the configuration of this Cobalt Strike beacon agent reveals the command and control
server, port, the attacker's public key to encrypt exfiltrated data and communications, user-agent,
POST URI, among other things, as shown below.

Adversaries are very opportunistic, often after headliner events like this, we see spam campaigns
that ride on a premise of such events. So the usual message applies, keep cautious of email,
especially unsolicited ones, and think twice before opening attachments.

Final Words
The notoriety and increasing threat posed by ransomware attacks have been impossible to prevent.
We recommend having a good backup solution, and this is crucial and of utmost importance
nowadays. Also, implementing a good patch management program could help add an additional
layer of security. These previous Trustwave blogs provide more advice on how to be prepared for
ransomware attacks.
Trustwave Managed IDS is deploying signatures to detect this campaign. Trustwave MailMarshal
has detections in place for the Kaseya-themed scam email. Additionally Trustwave Security Testing
Services are deploying checks for Kaseya VSA and customers should be able to scan and detect
VSA instances once the check is available. Thanks also to Diana Lopera and Karl Sigler for their
help and research in developing this post.
