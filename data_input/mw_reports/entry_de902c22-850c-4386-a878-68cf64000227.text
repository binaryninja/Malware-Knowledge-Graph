A new ransomware called SyncCrypt was discovered this week by Emsisoft security
researcher xXToffeeXx that is being distributed by spam attachments containing WSF files.
When installed these attachments will encrypt a computer and append the .kk extension to
encrypted files.
While the use of WSF files to distribute malware is not uncommon, when I analyzed the
script I noticed that the method being used to download and install the ransomware is quite
interesting. This is because the WSF script will download images with embedded ZIP files
that contain the necessary files to infect the computer with SyncCrypt. This method has also
made the images undetectable by almost all antivirus vendors on VirusTotal.
Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by SyncCrypt for free,
but if you wish to receive help or discuss this ransomware, you can use our dedicated
SyncCrypt Support Topic.

Images with Embedded Ransomware Evade Antivirus Detection
At this time we have not been able to find the actual spam emails that are distributing the
SyncCrypt downloader, but we do know that the WSF attachments are pretending to be court
orders with file names like CourtOrder_845493809.wsf. When executed, these WSF files
contain a JScript script that will download an image from one of three sites as shown below.

Download Images Script Source

If a user was to open one of these image URLs directly, they would just just see an image that
contains the logo for Olafur Arnalds' album titled "& They Have Escaped the Weight of
Darkness".

Embedded in this image, though, is a zip file containing the sync.exe, readme.html, and
readme.png files. These files are the core components of the SyncCrypt ransomware.

Hex Editor View of the Image File

After the image is downloaded to the %Temp% folder under a random named zip file, it will
extract the files into the %Temp%\BackupClient. The sync file is the executed to install the
ransomware, which is discussed in the next section.

3/12

BackupClient Folder Containing Ransomware Components

What makes this distribution highly effective is that the majority of antivirus vendors are
not detecting these image files. When I scanned these images files on VirusTotal, only
DrWeb out of 58 other vendors detected it as malware.

While the images alone are not malicious in any way, the distribution vector provides an
effective way to distribute malware without being detected by security software. Thankfully,
the malicious sync.exe executable has a much higher VirusTotal detection rate of 28 out of
63, but is still being missed by a great deal of popular vendors.

How the SyncCrypt Ransomware Encrypts Files
Once the Sync.exe executable is extracted from the zip file as described above, the WSF file
will create a Windows scheduled task called Sync that is configured to go off 1 minute after
the WSF file is executed. Once the sync.exe file is executed it will scan the computer for
certain file types and encrypt them using AES encryption. The AES key used to encrypt the
files will be encrypted with an embedded RSA-4096 public encryption key as saved in
%Desktop%\README\key.
The targeted file types are:
accdb, accde, accdr, adp, ach, arw, asp, aspx, backup, backupdb, bak, bat, bay, bdb,
bgt, blend, bmp, bpw, cdf, cdr, cdr3, cdr4, cdr5, cdr6, cdrw, cdx, cer, cfg, class,

When a file is encrypted it will have the .kk extension appended to the filename. For
example, a file named test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed as test.jpg.kk. You can see
an example of an encrypted folder below.

SyncCrypt Encrypted Files

While encrypting files, SyncCrypt will skip files located in the following folders:
windows\
program files (x86)\
program files\
programdata\
winnt\
\system volume information\
\desktop\readme\
\$recycle.bin\

When SyncCrypt has finished encrypting a computer, a folder called README will be
present on the desktop. This folder contains the AMMOUNT.txt, key, readme.html, and
readme.png files. The ammount.txt file is the ransom amount, the key is the encrypted
decryption key, and the other two files are the ransom notes. SyncCrypt will then
automatically open and display the readme.html ransom note in the victim's default browser
as shown below.

6/12

SyncCrypt Ransom Note

This ransom note will contain instructions to send a payment, which in my test
was 0.1001270 bitcoins or ~429 USD, to the enclosed bitcoin address. After a payment has
been made the victim is told to send an email containing the key file to one of
the getmyfiles@keemail.me, getmyfiles@scryptmail.com, or getmyfiles@mail2tor.com
emails to get a decrypter.
Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files for free, but if you wish to receive
help or discuss this ransomware, you can use our dedicated SyncCrypt Support Topic.

How to Protect Yourself from the SyncCrypt Ransomware
In order to protect yourself from SyncCrypt, or from any ransomware, it is important that
you use good computing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always
have a reliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an
emergency, such as a ransomware attack.
You should also have security software that contains behavioral detections such as Emsisoft
Anti-Malware or Malwarebytes. I also recommend trying a dedicated ransomware protection
program like RansomFree.
Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following good online security habits, which in
many cases are the most important steps of all:
Backup, Backup, Backup!
Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.
Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,
Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.
Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure
you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs
contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.
Therefore it is important to keep them updated.
Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed.
Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.

SyncCrypt Ransomware Ransom Note Text:

9/12

YOUR FILES WERE ENCRYPTED
using military grade encryption. The encrypted files have the additional extension
.kk. You won't be able to retrieve your data unless you purchase the software
provided by us. YOU HAVE EXACTLY 48 HOURS TO MAKE A DECISION OR YOU'LL NEVER SEE YOUR
FILES AGAIN. Any atempt to recover your files on your own could damage the files
permanently. There is no workaround, that's how encryption is supposed to work. In
order to retrieve your data, please follow the steps below:
Go to Desktop folder, and open AMMOUNT.txt from within README folder. Obtaining the
decryption sofware requires that you send EXACTLY the ammount of Bitcoin (without the
transaction fee) that is written within the text file to the following address:
15LK2BQxj2MJGZZ3kcUi3B4C42CQKKMQzK
Note that if the ammount sent doesn't match EXACTLY the ammount in the text file, you
will NOT receive the sofware, as it's the only way to validate and confirm the
payment.
After the payment is done, send an email to ALL of the following addresses
getmyfiles@keemail.me, getmyfiles@scryptmail.com, getmyfiles@mail2tor.com containg:
The file named KEY, located within the README folder on your Desktop, as an
Attachment - this file is a locked version of the decryption key (that must be
unlocked by us), used to recover your files. DO NOT delete it if you plan to get your
files back
The transaction id of the Bitcoin payment
Emails that dont contain the KEY file attached will be automatically rejected.
As soon as we confirm the payment, you will receive on your email address the
decription key together with the required software and the instructions to recover
your files.
Dont forget, TIME'S RUNNING OUT
