In our last update on the XCSSET campaign, we updated some of its features targeting latest macOS 11 (Big Sur). Since then,
the campaign added more features to its toolset, which we have continually monitored. We have also discovered the mechanism
used to steal information from various apps, a behavior that has been present since we first discussed XCSSET.
How XCSSET Malware Steals Information
From the first version of XCSSET, we noticed that it collects some data from various apps and sends these back to its commandand-control (C&C) server. However, we did not know how the threat actor would use the data. We recently found the mechanism
used to steal the data, and learned that it contains valuable and sensitive information that can be used for various purposes.
Take the malicious AppleScript file “telegram.applescript” as an example. As the name implies, Telegram is the target app in this
case. Its main logic is compressing the folder “~/Library/Group Containers/6N38VWS5BX.ru.keepcoder.Telegram” into a .ZIP file,
and uploading the said file to a C&C server.

Figure 1. Code of telegram.applescript
To find the purpose of collecting the folder, we performed a simple test using two Mac machines:
1. Install Telegram on both machine A and B./li>
2. On machine A, log in with a valid Telegram account. Do nothing using Telegram on machine B./li>
3. Copy “~/Library/Group Containers/6N38VWS5BX.ru.keepcoder.Telegram” folder from machine A to machine B, and
replace the existing folder.
4. Run Telegram on machine B. When this is done, it is already logged in with the same account used on machine A.
On macOS, the Application sandbox directory ~/Library/Containers/com.xxx.xxx and ~/Library/Group Containers/com.xxx.xxx
can be accessed (with READ/WRITE permissions) by common users. This differs from the practice on iOS. Not all executable
files are sandboxed on macOS, which means a simple script can steal all the data stored in the sandbox directory. We
recommend that application developers refrain from storing sensitive data in the sandbox directory, particularly those related to
login information.
Sensitive data targeted by XCSSET
XCSSET malware has stolen lots of critical privacy data of these applications, with most of them these stored in their sandbox
directories. Here, we’ll show how it is done in Chrome.
In Chrome, the stolen data includes any passwords stored by the user to dump the data, XCSSET needs to get the
safe_storage_key using the command security find- generic-password -wa ‘Chrome’ . However, this command requires root
privileges. To get around this requirement, the malware puts all the operations that need root privilege together in a single
function, as seen in Figure 2:

Figure 2. Operations requiring administrator privilege
The user is then prompted to grant these privileges via a fake dialog box.
Once it has obtained the Chrome safe_storage_key, it decrypts all the sensitive data and uploads it to the C&C server.

Similar scripts can be found targeting the following applications:

New C&C Domains
From April 20 to 22, 2021, some new domain names appeared, all of them resolve to the IP address 94.130.27.189, which
XCSSET also used before.
atecasec.com
linebrand.xyz
mantrucks.xyz
monotal.xyz
nodeline.xyz
sidelink.xyz
Similarly, the domain name below now resolves from a non-malicious IP address to 94.130.27.189.
icloudserv.com
All these new domain names have an HTTPS certificate from “Let’s Encrypt,” which is valid from April 22 to July 21, 2021.

From April 22, 2021, onwards, all C&C domain names resolved to 194.87.186.66. On May 1, a new domain name (ircnbg.v001.com) was resolved to the original C&C IP address 94.130.27.189. This new domain name suggests an IRC server is
now located at the said IP address, which does not appear to be currently related to XCSSET.
From June 9 to 10, 2021, all existing domain names related to XCSSET C&C servers were removed, Instead, the following new
domain names were added:
atecasec.info
datasomatic.ru
icloudserv.ru
lucidapps.info
relativedata.ru
revokecert.ru
safariperks.ru
However, on June 24, these servers were taken offline by the attackers. Currently, we have been unable to locate the new
servers of XCSSET.
Other Behavior Changes
Bootstrap.applescript
In bootstrap.applescript, the first noteworthy change is the use of the latest C&C domains:

Figure 6. C&C domains used
Note that aside from the available domain names, the IP address is also part of the list. Even if all the domains get suddenly shut
down in the future, the C&C server still can be reached via IP address.

Figure 7. Modules in use

A new module, “canary,” is added to perform XSS injection on the Chrome Canary browser from Google, which is an
experimental version of the Chrome browser.

Figure 8. Modules in use, showing removed module
Compared to the last version, the calling for “screen_sim” is removed.
Replicator.applescript
As the first step of infecting local Xcode projects, from the last version, they changed the injected build phrase or build rule’s ID
from a hardcoded ID to a randomly generated ID; however, the last six characters of the ID is still hardcoded as “AAC43A”. In the
latest version, the hardcoded postfix changed to “6D902C”.

Figure 9. Changed postfix
Regarding the logic of the script in injecting fake build phase and build rule: Previously, it called a malicious Mach-O file located
in a hidden folder in the infected Xcode project. Now, it calls the curl command to download a shell script named “a” from the
C&C server and passes its contents to “sh” to execute it. This way, any new infected Xcode projects from the latest version will
not contain additional malicious files.

Here are the contents of the shell script file downloaded from the C&C server. It downloads the landing Mach-O component Pods
from the C&C server, saves it as /tmp/exec.$$, adds an executable flag, and executes it.

Figure 11. Downloaded code
Same as before, the Mach-O file, “Pods,” is generated by the SHC tool. The primary logic of the shell script extracted from it is
quite similar to the one used before. The following screenshots list some of the notable changes.

Defending against XCSSET
The changes we’ve encountered in XCSSET do not reflect a fundamental change in its behavior but do constitute refinements in
its tactics. The discovery of how it can steal information from various apps highlights the degree to which the malware
aggressively attempts to steal various kinds of information from affected systems.
To protect systems from this type of threat, users should only download apps from official and legitimate marketplaces. Users
can also consider multilayered security solutions such as Trend Micro Maximum Security, which provides comprehensive
security and multidevice protection against cyberthreats.
Enterprises can take advantage of Trend Micro’s Smart Protection Suites with XGen™ security, which infuses highfidelity machine learning into a blend of threat protection techniques to eliminate security gaps across any user activity or
endpoint.
