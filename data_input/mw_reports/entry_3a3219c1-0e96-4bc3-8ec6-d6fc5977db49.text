The SSU Cyber Security Department identified hackers of the notorious ARMAGEDON
group, which carried out over 5,000 cyber attacks against public authorities and critical
infrastructure of Ukraine. They are officers of the ‘Crimean’ FSB and traitors who defected to
the enemy during the occupation of the peninsula in 2014.
The SSU has managed to identify the perpetrators’ names, intercept their communication
and obtain irrefutable evidence of their involvement in the attacks. All of that, despite the fact
that they used the FSB’s own malicious software and tools to remain anonymous and hidden
online.
5 members of the group have been notified of suspicion of treason.
The ARMAGEDON hacker group is an FSB special project, which specifically targeted
Ukraine. This ‘line of work’ is coordinated by the FSB’s 18th Center (Information Security
Center) based in Moscow.
Since the Russian aggression in 2014, this unit has carried out over 5,000 cyber attacks and
attempted to infect over 1,500 government computer systems. The attackers’ goals were:
control over critical infrastructure facilities (power plants, heat and water supply
systems);
theft and collection of intelligence, including information with restricted access (related
to security and defence sector, government agencies);
informational and psychological influence;
blocking information systems.
The investigation and forensic examinations are underway to bring the FSB employees to
justice for the following crimes: espionage; unauthorized interference in the work of
computers, automated systems, etc.; creation of malicious software or hardware for use,
distribution or sale.
The SSU is continuously taking steps to contain and neutralize Russia’s cyber aggression
against Ukraine.
The SSU Cyber Security Department, the SSU investigators carried out the operation jointly
with the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and under the
supervision of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
Technical report Armagedon.
