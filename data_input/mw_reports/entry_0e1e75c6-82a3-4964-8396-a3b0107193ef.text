Introduction
Whether considered advanced persistent threats (APTs) or malware-based
espionage attacks, successful and long-term compromises of high-value
organizations and enterprises worldwide by a consistent set of campaigns
cannot be ignored. Because “noisier” campaigns are becoming increasingly
well-known within the security community, new and smaller campaigns are
beginning to emerge.
This research paper documents the operations of a campaign we refer to as
“Safe,” based on the names of the malicious files used. It is an emerging and
active targeted threat.
Note that any mention of “SafeNet” in this paper is completely unrelated
to and has no association with SafeNet, Inc., a global leader in data
protection and a valued partner of Trend Micro. The author of the Safe
malware apparently maliciously used the word “SafeNet” as part of this
viral campaign, and to the extent the word “SafeNet” appears in this
paper, it appears solely as replicated in the attacking author’s malware
configuration. There is no correlation between SafeNet Inc. and the Safe
campaign and should not be interpreted as such.
The Safe campaign was able to compromise the following types of
organizations:
• Government ministries

• Academic research institutions

• Technology companies

• Nongovernmental organizations

• Media outlets
While we have yet to determine the campaign’s total number of victims, it
appears that nearly 12,000 unique IP addresses spread over more than
100 countries were connected to two sets of command-and-control (C&C)
infrastructures related to Safe. We also discovered that the average number of
actual victims remained at 71 per day, with few if any changes from day to day.
This indicates that the actual number of victims is far less than the number of
unique IP addresses. Due to large concentrations of IP addresses within specific
network blocks, it is likely that the number of victims is even smaller and that
they have dynamically assigned IP addresses, which have been compromised
for some time now.
Investigating targeted campaigns involves more than simply collecting
actionable indicators like malware samples and C&C server information.
Investigating and monitoring the activities of the Safe campaign over time, we
were able to take advantage of the mistakes the attackers made and thus gain
a deeper understanding of their operations. One of the C&C servers was set
up in such a way that the contents of the directories were viewable to anyone
who accessed them. As a result, not only were we able to determine who the
campaign’s victims were, but we were also able to download backup archives
that contained the PHP source code the attackers used for the C&C server and
the C code they used to generate the malware used in attacks.

PAGE 1 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

The author of the malware used in the campaign is probably a professional
software developer who studied at a technical university in China. This individual
appears to have repurposed legitimate source code from an Internet services
company in the same country for use as part of the campaign’s C&C server
code. As such, this may be a case in which a malware entrepreneur’s code was
used in targeted attacks.
In addition to understanding the tools and techniques used in this campaign,
we had the opportunity to analyze the data to determine its source. While the
information that we obtained suggested the identity of the malware author, we
were not able to attribute the campaign operation to him. In fact, while we were
able to identify the various IP addresses used by the operators, the geographic
diversity of the proxy servers and VPNs made it difficult to determine their true
origin.

Attack Vector
The distribution mechanism the
Safe campaign used involved spearphishing emails that contain a
malicious attachment. This technique,
which is quite common for APT
campaigns, encourages a recipient to
open a malicious attachment by
sending an email with contextually
relevant content.1
We discovered several malicious
documents that all exploited a
Microsoft Office® vulnerability (i.e.,
CVE-2012-0158).2 If opened with a
version of Microsoft Word® that is not
up-to-date, a malicious payload is
silently installed on the user’s
computer.

http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158

In addition to the Tibetan-themed attack vector, we found documents written in
Mongolian though their exact targets remain unclear.

Malware
First Stage
Opening the malicious document on a system running a vulnerable version of
Microsoft Office opens the decoy document for the user to view. Note though
that this also drops malicious files onto the system that allows the attackers to
take control of it. After the initial compromise, the attackers may then steal files
from the compromised system.
The decoy document, NBC Interview_Excerpts.doc, has the MD5 hash,
a2da9cda33ce378a21f54e9f03f6c0c9efba61fa. It drops the following files:
• smcs.exe (91e6277a70d48ed953ac9208275e5dc855a8f7a7), which
contains:
• SafeCredential.DAT (303e982d0929ca2c50809323dff66be38a46926a)
• SafeExt.org (2029399fb4be3d88c2ba0a7544b1ebec58157639), which
contains:
• SafeExt.dll (cde35c8da8c420aeaf5adda14ba68d18010479fa)
The malware the malicious documents drop has several components, including:
• SafeExt.dll: Contains the malware’s main functionality.
• SafeCredential.DAT: Contains the RC4 key, C&C information, and
campaign “mark.”
If User Account Control (UAC) is active, SafeExt.dll will be injected into
explorer.exe. Otherwise, the file is copied to %Program Files%\Internet
Explorer\SafeNet\ and registered as a Browser Helper Object (BHO).3

Figure 3: RC4 key, C&C information, and campaign mark

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_
Helper_Object

PAGE 3 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

The malware then accesses a C&C
server over HTTP POST to send data
using the domain name and URL path
in SafeCredential.DAT. The network
traffic is encrypted with the RC4 key in
SafeCredential.DAT. One key
indicator that can be used to detect
this network communication is the
user-agent, Fantasia.
During our investigation of the C&C
servers associated with Safe, we
discovered a backup script that the
attackers used to archive the files on
them. This allowed us to acquire the
source code for the .PHP files used on
the C&C servers.

Figure 4: Check in with the C&C server

Figure 5: Safe backup script

The data that the malware sends from
a compromised host to report.php is
decrypted by the C&C server and
stored in a MySQL™ database. In
addition to RC4 encryption use, the
file’s content is XORed with the
function in Figure 6.
The parameters of the query are
unpacked and sent to a function that
Figure 6: Safe’s VisualEncrypt function
inserts the information the
compromised host provides into the MySQL database. It then checks
the database to see if the attackers specified instructions to send to the
compromised host. If there are, these instructions are sent back to the
compromised host.

Figure 7: Safe’s check-in function

PAGE 4 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

The REQUEST_TYPE_CLIENT_REQUEST function inserts a unique ID for
each compromised host as well as the Internet and external IP addresses,
hostname, Windows domain, the system’s disc drive information, and a
campaign mark. It has a field to store information about any additional malware
plug-ins that have been installed on the system.
The malware uses the following marks or campaign tags:
• 120713

• L0821

• 120713p

• Lewis120713px

• 123456

• N0911

• 654321

• Weber0720p

• c0814

• 720p

• C0821

• L1224

Second Stage
After the initial compromise, the attackers may instruct compromised systems
to download additional malware and tools. The tools that we discovered were
located on the same C&C servers.

Plug-Ins
The data contained in the C&C servers references plug-ins that are available
for the malware. We believe they are related to the malware’s data-exfiltration
capabilities. The names of the plug-ins are:
• OpenDoc
• UsbDoc
• UsbExe

Tools
The tools used by Safe are off-the-shelf programs that are able to extract saved
passwords from Internet Explorer® (IE) and Mozilla Firefox® as well as any
stored Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials.4

The tools are publicly available at http://www.nirsoft.net/.

PAGE 5 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

C&C

Figure 8: Password extraction tools

We found two sets of C&C servers that do not seem to have anything in
common apart from being used in conjunction with the same malware. The first
set of C&C servers had Mongolian-themed domain names—mongolbaatar.
us and mongolbaatarsonin.in. The second set of C&C servers use the
domains, getapencil.com, which was registered with a privacy protection
service, and withoutcake.com, which was registered by wanxian@126.
com.5 Willyoumarryadog.com may also be a C&C server but we have not yet
discovered samples that use this domain name.

Figure 9: Safe C&C server infrastructure
The Tibetan- and Mongolian-themed attack vectors described earlier are
connected to the first infrastructure (i.e., mongolbaatar). We were unable to
discover attack vectors for the second C&C infrastructure.

5

PAGE 6 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

A variety of services can be used so the registrant information required to register a domain
name will not be publicly visible in the WHOIS directory.

Campaign Connections
One of the C&C servers used, withoutcake.com, was registered using the
email address, wanxian@126.com. This email address has been used to
register 17 domain names, five of which have been confirmed to be C&C
servers.

Figure 10: Connections to other campaigns
The domain, sugarsbutters.com, was used in attacks that leveraged images of
Russian model, Irina Shayk, and dropped the iMuler malware that affects Mac
OS X systems in November 2012.6 Three domains—aq5u.org, prettyb0yinus.
com, and shumetheme.org—have also been used as C&C servers for
campaigns using the Enfal malware.7

Identification of Victims
We were able to identify victims in two ways. First, we were able to download
a list of victims that were currently online from the C&C servers. Second, we
were also able to download logs from the C&C servers that listed all of the IP
addresses that “checked in” to them using the REQUEST_TYPE_CLIENT_
REQUEST function.
The first set of C&C servers (i.e., mongolbataar) appeared to have only three
“live” victims—one with an IP address assigned to South Sudan, another with
an address assigned to Mongolia, and another that did not list an external IP
address.
The logs we obtained from the first set of C&C servers showed that 243 unique
IP addresses from 11 different countries checked in to them.

We discovered that on average, 71 victims accessed the getapencil.com C&C
server at any given time. The actual total victim count was significantly lower
than the number of unique IP addresses though.

PAGE 8 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

Tools
A closer look at the C&C servers allowed us to identify the tools and source
code the threat actors used to create, distribute, and encrypt/decrypt data. The
tools presented in this section either came preassembled or could be compiled
using the source code that could be downloaded from the getapencil.com C&C
server.

TypeConfig/SafeDisk
The primary function of TypeConfig/SafeDisk appears to be embedding a
backdoor into a valid .PE file. This tool appears to be the primary method for
creating the malware related to the campaign.

Figure 11: Data flow diagram showing TypeConfig malware creation

Figure 12: TypeConfig and translated graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

PAGE 9 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

The fields in the TypeConfig GUI allow an attacker to specify a C&C server
location and data like the malware’s name and version number, which are sent
back to the attacker after a compromise.

DECRYPT.exe
We also pulled the application,
DECRYPT.exe, from a getapencil.
com C&C server. This application is a
custom encrypter/decrypter for any file
inputted into the application. Further
analysis of this application shows that
it uses large portions of Makoto
Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura’s
Random Number Generator (RNG) for
encryption functionality.8

Figure 13: DECRYPT.exe’s GUI with some
translated content

Once the Decrypt button is pressed, a
password validation box appears.
We were able to identify victim files
that were on “drop servers” that utilize
DECRYPT.exe for encryption/
decryption.

Figure 14: Password validation box that
appears when the Decrypt button is pressed

Common Tools
We also identified security tools with both valid and nefarious purposes and
have been used in other campaigns on the C&C servers. We listed some of
these along with their functionality below:
• LZ77: Used to compress and decompress files.
• UPXShell: Commonly used to pack malware in order to make it more
difficult for analysts to reverse-engineer.
• DebugView: A Microsoft Sysinternals tool that allows you to monitor debug
outputs on your local system.
• Build.bat: Used to open TypeConfig and “automate” malware creation
processes.
• Compress.bat: Used to automatically compress files defined in a batch file
with the aid of LZ77.exe.
• PECompress.bat: Used to compress files identified in a batch file with the
aid of UPXShell.exe.

Source Code
This section shows some of the discoveries we made while trying to identify the
functionality and use cases of each application we discovered. Nearly all of the
samples were coded in C, specifically Visual C.
The directory structure of the source code appeared to be standard of
directories written using C, Visual Studio® Express, or a litany of other tools.
The code appeared to be very robust. We created a complete mind map of the
code, its directories and the files located within the said directories.9

Figure 15: High-level directory/code structure of our findings
The applications in the following section are only a few of those that contained
some of the most interesting details about our findings.

Due to the number and depth of directories discovered, what has been included here is only a
portion of the mind map we created.

Code Analysis

Figure 16: SafeDisk/TypeConfig source tree
We were able to correlate similarities
between TypeConfig.exe and
SafeDisk.exe. While reverseengineering code and functionality, we
Figure 17: Code identifying SafeDisk.exe
discovered that the two applications
were identical in function. We have not, however, ascertained what the purpose
behind differential naming is, but their functionality appeared to be very similar.
We also identified fields in
TypeConfig.exe by directly correlating
the code to the fields within the GUI.
Another interesting feature to note
within TypeConfig.exe is its use of
SafeCredential.DAT, which the threat
actors created to specify the RC4
encryption key, C&C server
information, and campaign mark.

PAGE 12 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

C&C Source Code

Figure 20: PHP source code tree
The C&C functionality was written in
PHP. The code required config.php,
which contained the configuration for
the MySQL database where victim
information was stored; global.php,
which contained some mapping of
strings to command numbers; upload.
php, which provided the functionality
for data exfiltration; and utils.php,
which contained the encryption
functions in order to encrypt and
decrypt communications between a
compromised host and a C&C server.
Compromised hosts and malicious
Figure 21: Safe commands
operators interacted with record.php,
the primary file required for C&C operation. The utils directory also contained
code for extensive logging and what appeared to be repurposed legitimate code.
When compromised computers accessed record.php, they interacted with the
functionality labeled CLIENT. Operators used MANAGE commands to interact
with the C&C functionality.

Attribution
Identifying who is responsible for targeted attacks is not an easy task. The term
“attribution” is applied to everything, ranging from individuals to governments.
The technical indicators often used to determine attribution like domain name
registration data and geographic locations of IP addresses can be easily
falsified. Modern attackers often use “hop” points that consist of compromised
systems as well as proxy servers and VPNs to disguise their origin. It is trivial
to purchase virtual private servers (VPSs) in just about any country, and
determining who ultimately benefits from the spoils of targeted attacks is often a
matter of interpretation based on geopolitics with limited exploration of possible
alternative explanations.

PAGE 13 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

The technical indicators used to attribute attacks vary, depending on what is
being analyzed. In some cases, the term “attribution” is used to refer to the
developers of either the exploits or malware payloads. They could very well be
completely different threat actors. The term is also used to refer to identify the
providers of C&C infrastructures used in targeted attacks, particularly those that
registered the domain names. It can also refer to obtaining specific information
about the campaign operators who launch attacks and operate the C&C
infrastructure.
This paper presents some of the technical evidence we discovered during our
investigation. We focused on two threat actor types—developers and operators.
We were able to uncover clues that indicate the identity of the malware author
that were left in the source code as well as through open source analysis. We
were able to obtain limited insights into the activities of the C&C operators
through the logs they collected, which recorded the IP addresses they used to
operate and manage the C&C servers.

Developers
Throughout much of the code, we saw
indications of its origin. For instance,
when looking at the code for the file,
TypeConfig.vcproj.INTERNAL.
[REDACTED]04.user, located under
Src>TypeConfig, we were not only
able to locate the author’s name but
also the language setting, <?xml
version=“1.0” encoding=
“gb2312”?>, which refers to the
registered Internet name for a key
official character set of the People’s
Republic of China (PRC).10 However,
Figure 22: TypeConfig’s source code
other comments, especially those
within the PHP code, often appeared in English.
In addition to the language used, we
found that the malware author used
a name in several places throughout
the source code. For instance, under
the directory, Src>TypeConfig>, we
noticed an interesting .vcproj file called
“TypeConfig.vcproj.INTERNAL.
[REDACTED]04.user.”

Figure 23: Vcproj configuration with
machine name

This file contains a remote machine
configuration module that includes the author’s name and the name of the
development machine used, which directly correlates to “CompanyName”
found elsewhere in the code.

10

PAGE 14 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_2312

Figure 24: TypeConfig’s source code with author information
We found the string, “CompanyName,” in the C source code that contains
the same name as the development machine’s. The PHP code used as the
C&C server’s back end contained a copyright notice that matches the author’s
name in the C code as well as an email address/QQ number that matches the
“CompanyName” in the C code.

Figure 25: Copyright notice containing a name and an email address/QQ number
The email address was used to register a domain name for a personal blog
about software development with a Beijing street address. We also found the
same name and email address used by an author of an academic paper at
a technical university in China. Posts on this individual’s personal blog also
indicate a relationship with the same university, including the development of
some legitimate software.

PAGE 15 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

The “CompanyName” in the source
code, portions of which are contained
in the email address/QQ number, were
also found in source code for
keyloggers and malware posted on a
Chinese code-sharing site.
Figure 26: Repurposed source code
We also found legitimate code that
appears to have been developed by an
Internet services company used as
part of the C&C panel. This code was
not developed by the same person that
we believe developed the Safe malware
but appears to simply have been reused. Figure 27: SVN repository with user name
We believe though that
this code is not publicly available.
In the code’s archive we recovered from the C&C servers, we found a .csv
directory that contains an entries file that contains the location of the repository
as well as the time, version, and user name of the person who last committed
the source code. The author information indicates that the malware author
checked the code in to the Internet services company’s private SVN repository.
It appears that the malware author has been repurposing the code for his own
malware project.
We believe the malware author is a professional software engineer that is
familiar with version control. We also found indicators that this individual is
proficient in software development due to the high quality of the source code he
used. The entire source code was explicitly written with future development in
mind. It was modularized and heavily commented on in a way that allows further
development even by several engineers. These qualities are traditionally seen
in the work of professional software engineers that have been taught traditional
computer science.
Apart from being significantly well-organized and well-commented, the code
was also developed with defensive programming in mind. Each of the variables
was named in a very obvious manner, helping other engineers easily distinguish
functionality; again, a trait seen in the work of many professional software
engineers. In addition to being heavily commented on and using intuitive
variable naming conventions, the code also had an apparent slant toward
usability. Each interface was very intuitive and well-designed, something not
often seen in the code of a hobbyist.
The use of terms like “bot,” combined with the author’s posting of the malware
code to code-sharing sites, indicate a degree of familiarity with the cybercriminal
underground in China. We have not, however, uncovered evidence that links the
malware author with the campaign’s operators.

Operators
We were unable to obtain information beyond IP addresses that indicate the
origin of those issuing MANAGE or other C&C requests. The extensive logging
performed by the C&C servers, however, allowed us to differentiate between the
victims’ and operators’ IP addresses.

While most of the operator interactions we saw were from China and Hong
Kong, we also saw the use of VPNs and proxy tools, including Tor, which
contributed to the geographic diversity of the operators’ IP addresses.

Conclusion
Ongoing cyber-espionage campaigns have been successfully infiltrating targets
worldwide, many of which have been active for years. However, the amount
of public exposure, especially of noisier and larger campaigns, has been
increasing. Perhaps due to their success, these campaigns’ operators intensified
their operations, causing them to be increasingly visible. But smaller campaigns
are beginning to emerge; these use small clusters of C&C servers and new
malware as well as attack fewer targets.
While determining the intent and identity of the attackers often remains difficult
to ascertain, we determined that the Safe campaign is targeted and uses
malware developed by a professional software engineer that may be connected
to the cybercriminal underground in China. This individual studied at a prominent
technical university in the same country and appears to have access to an
Internet services company’s source code repository. This individual developed
malware that was, in turn, used for targeted attacks leveraging two distinct sets
of C&C infrastructure.

PAGE 17 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

As the tools used in targeted attacks are exposed, attackers may look for new
custom malware to circumvent defenses. As a result, attackers may increasingly
look to the cybercriminal underground for new malicious tools instead of
developing their own tools for exclusive use. These developments highlight the
increasing need for ongoing investigation and monitoring of such threats. While
indicators that can be directly incorporated into defensive operations remain
important, in-depth qualitative analysis of particular campaigns can provide
critical insights into attackers’ operations. Furthermore, attribution should not
be entirely based on the common use of tools and infrastructure, as these are
increasingly not being developed and used exclusively by particular sets of
threat actors.

Defending Against Targeted
Attacks
Sufficiently motivated threat actors can penetrate even networks that use
moderately advanced security measures. As such, apart from standard
and relevant attack prevention measures and mechanisms like solid patch
management; endpoint and network security; firewall use; and the like,
enterprises should also focus on detecting and mitigating attacks. Moreover,
data loss prevention (DLP) strategies that identify the data an organization is
protecting and take into account the context of data use should be employed.

Local and External Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence refers to indicators that can be used to identify the tools,
tactics, and procedures threat actors engaging in targeted attacks use. Both
external and local threat intelligence is crucial for developing the ability to detect
attacks early. The following are the core components of this defense strategy:
• Enhancing visibility: Logs from endpoint, server, and network monitoring
are an important and often underused resource that can be aggregated to
provide a view of the activities within an organization that can be processed
for anomalous behaviors, which can indicate a targeted attack.
• Performing integrity checks: In order to maintain persistence, malware
will make modifications to the file system and registry. Monitoring such
changes can indicate the presence of malware.
• Empowering the human analyst: Humans are best positioned to identify
anomalous behaviors when presented with a view of aggregated logs from
across a network. This information is used in conjunction with custom alerts
based on the local and external threat intelligence available.
Technologies available today like Deep Discovery provide visibility, insight, and
control over networks to defend against targeted threats.11 Deep Discovery
uniquely detects and identifies evasive threats in real-time and provides in-depth
analysis and actionable intelligence to prevent, discover, and reduce risks.

Mitigation and Cleanup Strategy
Once an attack is identified, the cleanup strategy should focus on the following
objectives:
• Determine the attack vector and cut off communications with the C&C
server.
• Determine the scope of the compromise.
• Assess the damage by analyzing the data and forensic artifacts available on
compromised machines.
Remediation should be applied soon afterward, which includes steps to fortify
affected servers, machines, or devices into secure states, informed in part by
how the compromised machines were infiltrated.

Educating Employees Against Social
Engineering
Security-related policies and procedures combined with education and training
programs are essential components of defense. Traditional training methods
can be fortified by simulations and exercises using real spear-phishing attempts
sent to test employees. Employees trained to expect targeted attacks are better
positioned to report potential threats and constitute an important source of threat
intelligence.

Data-Centric Protection Strategy
The ultimate objective of targeted attacks is to acquire sensitive data. As such,
DLP strategies that focus on identifying and protecting confidential information
are critical. Enhanced data protection and visibility across an enterprise
provides the ability to control access to sensitive data as well as monitor and
log successful and unsuccessful attempts to access it. Enhanced access
control and logging capabilities allow security analysts to locate and investigate
anomalies, respond to incidents, and initiate remediation strategies and damage
assessment.

Trend Micro Threat Protection
Against the Safe Campaign
Part of processing and identifying the components of the Safe campaign is
creating a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations better
identify and locate certain tools, malware, and traffic patterns that could indicate
compromise.

PAGE 19 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

The following table summarizes the Trend Micro solutions for the components of the Safe campaign. Trend Micro
recommends a comprehensive security risk management strategy that goes further than advanced protection to meet the
real-time threat management requirements of dealing with targeted attacks.

PAGE 21 | Safe: A Targeted Threat

May 2013 | Campaign Quick Profile: Safe
Targeted attacks are attacks that appear to be intended for specific entities or organizations. Unlike indiscriminate
cybercrime attacks, spam, web threats, and the like, targeted attacks are much harder to detect because of the
nature of related components and techniques.

SAFE

• First Seen
Individual targeted attacks are not one-off attempts. Attackers continually try to get inside the target’s network.
The Safe campaign was first seen on October 2012.

• Victims and Targets
Targeted threats target specific industries or communities of interest in specific regions.
The Safe campaign was able to compromise government ministries, technology companies, media outlets, academic research institutions, and
nongovernmental organizations.
Furthermore, it was discovered that the average number of actual victims remained at 71 per day, with few if any changes from day to day.

• Operations
First-stage computer intrusions often use social engineering. Attackers custom-fit attacks to their targets.
The Safe campaign attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. Attackers used several malicious documents that all exploited a
Microsoft Office® vulnerability (i.e., CVE-2012-0158). If opened with a version of Microsoft Word® that is not up-to-date, a malicious payload is silently
installed on the user’s computer.
In addition, one of the C&C servers used in the Safe campaign was set up in such a way that the contents of the directories were viewable to anyone
who accessed them.

• Possible Indicators of Compromise
Attackers want to remain undetected as long as possible. A key characteristic of targeted attacks is stealth.
Below is a list of the components of the Safe campaign.
Network traffic identifiers:
»» Network traffic going to mongolbaatarsonin.

»» Network traffic going to withoutcake.com
»» Network traffic going to mongolbaatar.us
»» Network traffic going to getapencil.com

Host-based identifiers:
»» Presence of SafeExt.dll on the host
(commonly found in %Program Files%\

»» Presence of SafeCredential.DAT on the
host (commonly found in %Program Files%\
