Surveillance Operations

Overview
Despite the reveal of “Domestic Kitten” by Check Point in 2018, APT-C-50 has not
stopped conducting extensive surveillance operations against Iranian citizens that could
pose a threat to the stability of the Iranian regime, including internal dissidents,
opposition forces, ISIS advocates, the Kurdish minority in Iran, and more.
In this paper, Check Point Research reveals the extent of the operations, the multiple
campaigns executed by APT-C-50, their delivery methods, and an analysis of the targeted
individuals. In addition, we provide a technical analysis of the FurBall malware used since
the beginning of the operation, its origin, and observed covers used to conceal the
malware’s true nature.

General
Check Point researchers recently uncovered the full extent of Domestic Kitten’s extensive
surveillance operation against Iranian citizens that could pose a threat to the stability of
the Iranian regime. The operation itself is linked to the Iranian government, and executed
by APT-C-50.
Starting in 2017, this operation, consisting of 10 unique campaigns, targeted over 1,200
individuals with more than 600 successful infections. It includes 4 currently active
1/17

campaigns, the most recent of which began in November 2020.
In these campaigns, victims are lured to install a malicious application by multiple
vectors, including an Iranian blog site, Telegram channels, and even by SMS with a link to
the malicious application.
The capabilities of the Domestic Kitten malware (which we are calling FurBall), include:
collecting device identifiers, grabbing SMS messages and call logs, surround recording
with the device microphone, call recording, stealing media files (such as videos and
photos), obtaining a list of installed applications, tracking the device location, stealing
files from the external storage, and more. For a full list of commands, see the Technical
Analysis section.

Campaigns & Victims
Almost all of the campaigns we observed use the same infrastructure that Domestic Kitten
used back in 2018, the C&C hXXp://www[.]firmwaresystemupdate[.]com. We
differentiate between campaigns by the URI segment of the C&C server. For example, in
the most recent campaign the full C&C address is
hXXp://www[.]firmwaresystemupdate[.]com/hass (which we call the ‘hass’ campaign
for obvious reasons).

Figure 1 – Domestic Kitten Campaign list
FurBall uses a large variety of covers to mask its malicious intentions. A few prominent
covers include:
VIPRE Mobile Security – A fake mobile security application.
2/17

ISIS Amaq – A news outlet for the Amaq news agency.
Exotic Flowers – A repackaged version of a game from Google Play.
MyKet – An Android application store.
Iranian Woman Ninja – A wallpaper application.
In the newest ‘hass’ campaign, APT-C-50 mimics an application for the restaurant
“Mohsen Restaurant” which is located in Tehran. Covers of the ‘mmh’ campaign include
an ISIS supporter application and a repackaged version of ‘Exotic Flowers’ from Google
Play.

A full list of the covers is provided in Appendix 1 – FurBall Covers.
The methods used to deliver FurBall applications to victims also varies from one
campaign to another. In some campaigns, we observed SMS messages with a link to
download the malware, while in others an Iranian blog site hosted the payload. In
another campaign, we assume that the application was shared in a Telegram channel.

We were able to identify victims of the Domestic Kitten operation from various places
around the globe, including Iran, the United States, Great Britain, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
Turkey, and more.

Figure 6 – Successful attacks by date and campaign
We traced 2 unique IPs that connected to the malware’s C&C server. We assume that
those IPs are used to send instructions to the server: 94.182.215.98 and 188.158.60.100.
According to ip2location.com, both IPs reside in Iran, the first in Tehran, and the second
in Karaj.

FurBall – Technical Analysis

7/17

Upon execution, the first thing Furball does is to allow execution of the application on the
device startup. To achieve this, FurBall starts its code on a receiver that listens for the
BOOT_COMPLETED event, which in turn calls to the ‘startService’ method to initiate
everything that is needed for the malware’s functionality.

Figure 8 – BOOT_COMPLETED receiver

Figure 9 – The startService method
In addition, this piece of code also initializes a ‘settings’ object, which contains the
configuration for FurBall: which C&C to connect to, another back-up C&C address, flags
to allow functionality, frequency for C&C pulling commands, and more.

Figure 10 – FurBall configuration

8/17

After initialization, FurBall creates 3 threads.
The first periodically sends media files such as videos, photos, and call records to the
server, with a default frequency of every 20 seconds. The remaining 2 threads are keepalive threads that communicate with <C&C Address>/<campaign>/answer.php.
We assume this allows the threat actors to see which devices are currently active.
The next step for FurBall is to initialize the Command Manager. This component pulls
commands from the C&C by requesting the <C&C>/<campaign>/get-function.php
and awaits commands. Each command is delimited by the “===”string, and the
arguments are delimited by the “~~~” string.

After all initializations, it’s time to start collecting the initial data on the device. FurBall
collects the following data on startup:
Hardware Information
Contacts
Call logs
Accounts
Browser history
File list on the SD card

After collecting initial data on the device, FurBall initialize two other components. The
first one is a clipboard monitor which monitors the clipboard content (where data is
stored when it’s “copied”), and the other collects info about the top-most application’s
activity.

Figure 16 – Top-most application monitor
The last significant component that is used by FurBall is the Notification Observer
Service, a service that is based on the NotificationListenerService and allows FurBall to
access all notifications received by the device.

Figure 17 – NotificationObserverService
While investigating the new version of Domestic Kitten’s FurBall, we noticed that FurBall
is actually based on a commercially available parental control software called KidLogger .
As FurBall shares a lot of infrastructure code with KidLogger, it seems that the developers
used the KidLogger source-code available on github.
13/17

A few noticeable differences between KidLogger and FurBall:
FurBall has a configuration update mechanism that is not present in KidLogger.
FurBall is based on plain threads, while KidLogger is based on services.
