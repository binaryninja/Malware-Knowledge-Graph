Attackers most likely linked to Iran have attacked a string of telecoms operators in the Middle
East and Asia over the past six months, in addition to a number of IT services organizations
and a utility company.
Organizations in Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan,
Thailand, and Laos were targeted in the campaign, which appears to have made no use of
custom malware and instead relied on a mixture of legitimate tools, publicly available
malware, and living-off-the-land tactics. While the identity of the attackers remains
unconfirmed, there is some evidence to suggest a link to the Iranian Seedworm (aka
MuddyWater) group. The targeting and tactics are consistent with Iranian-sponsored actors.

Attack outline
1/6

After breaching a targeted network, the attackers typically attempt to steal credentials and
move laterally across the network. They appear to be particularly interested in Exchange
Servers, deploying web shells onto them. In some cases, the attackers may be using
compromised organizations as stepping stones to additional victims. Furthermore, some
targets may have been compromised solely to perform supply-chain-type attacks on other
organizations.
In most attacks, the infection vector is unknown. Evidence of a possible vector was found at
only one target. A suspected ScreenConnect setup MSI appeared to have been delivered in
a zipped file named “Special discount program.zip”, suggesting that it arrived in a spearphishing email.

Telecoms attack
In one attack against a telecoms firm in the Middle East, which began in August 2021, the
first evidence of compromise was the creation of a service to launch an unknown Windows
Script File (WSF). Scripts were then used to issue various domain, user discovery, and
remote service discovery commands.
The attackers used PowerShell to download another WSF and run it. Net group was used to
query for the “exchange trusted subsystem” domain group.
The attackers used Certutil to download a suspected Ligolo tunneling tool and launch WMI,
which was used to get remote machines to carry out the following tasks:
Execute Certutil to download an unknown file
Execute Certutil to download an unknown WSF file and execute Wscript to launch this
script
Execute PowerShell to download and execute content
Execute PowerShell to download a suspected web shell to an Exchange Server
Based on process lineage data, attackers seemed to use scripts extensively. These may be
automated scripts used for collecting information and downloading additional tools. However,
in one instance, a command asks cURL for help, suggesting that there may have been at
least some hands-on-keyboard activity on the part of the attackers.
The attackers then used a remote access tool, believed to be eHorus, to perform the
following tasks:
Deliver and run a suspected Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
dumping tool
Deliver what are believed to be Ligolo tunneling tools
Execute Certutil to request a URL from Exchange Web Services (EWS) of what
appears to be other targeted organizations

2/6

One feature of this attack against a telecoms organization is that the attackers may have
attempted to pivot to other targets by connecting to the Exchange Web Services (EWS) of
other organizations, another telecoms operator, and an electronic equipment company in the
same region. The following commands were used:
certutil.exe -urlcache –split [DASH]f hxxps://[REDACTED]/ews/exchange[.]asmx
certutil.exe -urlcache -split [DASH]f hxxps://webmail.[REDACTED][.]com/ews
It is unclear what the intent of these requests is. It is possible the attackers were attempting
to check connectivity to these organizations.

Possible supply chain attack
One target that appeared to be an outlier was a utility company in Laos. The infection vector
may have been the exploit of a public-facing service since the first machine that appeared to
be compromised was an IIS web server. Suspicious activity also had w3wp.exe in the
process lineage.
The attackers then used PowerShell to:
Download a suspected Ligolo tunneling tool
Download an unknown PowerShell script
Download an unknown XLS file
The attackers then used PowerShell to connect to a webmail server of an organization in
Thailand. They also attempted to connect to IT-related servers belonging to another
company in Thailand.
To facilitate credential theft, WMI was used to execute PowerShell to modify the registry to
store passwords in plaintext in memory. In addition to this, an obfuscated version of the
publicly available CrackMapExec tool appeared to be deployed.

Toolset
The attackers made heavy use of legitimate tools and publicly available hacking tools. These
include:
ScreenConnect: Legitimate remote administration tool
RemoteUtilities: Legitimate remote administration tool
eHorus: Legitimate remote administration tool
Ligolo: Reverse tunneling tool
Hidec: Command line tool for running a hidden window
Nping: Packet generation tool
LSASS Dumper: Tool that dumps credentials from Local Security Authority Subsystem
Service (LSASS) process
3/6

SharpChisel: Tunneling tool
Password Dumper
CrackMapExec: Publicly available tool that is used to automate security assessment of
an Active Directory environment
ProcDump: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for monitoring an application for CPU spikes
and generating crash dumps, but which can also be used as a general process dump
utility
SOCKS5 proxy server: Tunneling tool
Keylogger: Retrieves browser credentials
Mimikatz: Publicly available credential dumping tool

Seedworm link?
There is some evidence to suggest that the Iranian Seedworm group was responsible for
these attacks. Two IP addresses used in this campaign have been previously linked to
Seedworm activity. However, Seedworm is known to regularly switch its infrastructure,
meaning conclusive attribution cannot be made.
There is also some overlap in tools between this campaign and earlier Seedworm
campaigns. ScreenConnect, RemoteUtilities, SharpChisel, Ligolo, ProcDump, and Password
Dumper were all referenced by Trend Micro in a March 2021 blog on Seedworm activity.
In the case of two tools – SharpChisel and Password Dumper – identical versions were used
in this campaign to those that were documented by Trend.

Focused campaign
If these attacks are linked to Iran, it will not be the first time an Iranian threat actor has
targeted the telecoms sector. In 2018, Symantec revealed that the Chafer group had
compromised of a major telecoms services provider in the Middle East.
While the ultimate end goal of the campaign remains unknown, the focus on telecoms
operators suggests that the attackers are gathering intelligence on the sector and possibly
attempting to pivot into spying on communications.
