Massive Phishing Campaign

Over a period beginning last fall and continuing into April, the National Health Service (NHS)
of the United Kingdom fell prey to a large phishing operation. What had been sporadic use of
legitimate NHS accounts to send phishing emails to unsuspecting third parties became a
massive campaign in March.
The true scope of the attack could have been much larger, as INKY detected only those
attempts made on our customers. But given how many we found, it’s safe to say that the
total iceberg was much bigger than the tip we saw.
INKY shared its findings with the NHS, which sent the following response:
“We have processes in place to continuously monitor and identify these risks. We address
them in collaboration with our partners who support and deliver the national NHSmail
service.
"NHS organisations running their own email systems will have similar processes and
protections in place to identify and coordinate their responses, and call upon NHS Digital
assistance if required."
Between background statements by the NHS and our investigations, we were able to
determine that the breach was not a compromised mail server but rather individually hijacked
accounts.
As of April 19, INKY mostly stopped receiving phishing reports from the NHS domain, likely
due to the messaging team’s efforts to mitigate the incursion. One exception was the author,
who received a simple request to reply to a Gmail account, sent from the NHS domain. Our
data analysts found a few others scattered about our user base.

Quick Take: Attack Flow Overview
Type: phishing
Vector: emails sent from NHS servers
Payload: credential harvesting links
Techniques: brand impersonation, credential harvesting, hijacked accounts
Platform: Microsoft 365

Target: Microsoft 365 users

The Attack
Starting in October 2021 and escalating dramatically in March 2022, INKY detected 1,157
phishing emails originating from NHSMail, the NHS email system for employees based in
England and Scotland. Last year, this service was migrated from an on-premise installation
to Microsoft Exchange Online. This migration, with its changed security environment, could
have been a factor in the attack.
We reported our initial findings to the NHS on April 13, and as of April 14, the volume of
attacks decreased dramatically, as the NHS took measures to stop them. However, INKY
users were still receiving a few phishing emails from the NHS mail domain (nhs[.]net) after
that time.

Graph of NHS phish sent per month
During the study period, the phishing emails originated from email accounts that belonged to
139 NHS employees.
INKY data analysts validated the email accounts via two methods:
LinkedIn profiles and NHS staff directory links confirmed that these accounts belonged
to real NHS employees.

Search results confirmed the identity of NHS employees with compromised accounts
Pinging the SMTP server drew replies of “250 OK,” establishing that the email
addresses existed. Although our spot checks were statistical rather than exhaustive,
we got a “250 OK” response for every email that we checked.

Example of SMTP ping results
All phishing emails were sent from two IP addresses (213.161.89.71 and 213.161.89.103)
used by the NHS. They also passed email authentication for nhs.net. The NHS confirmed
that the two addresses were relays within the mail system used for a large number of
accounts.

All phishing emails authenticated to nhs.net
The majority were fake new document notifications with malicious links to credential
harvesting sites that targeted Microsoft credentials. All emails also had the NHS email footer
at the bottom.

Sample phishing email with NHS footer
Some emails impersonated Adobe and Microsoft by using their logos in phishing emails.

Example of an Adobe impersonation
A few were advance-fee scams.

Advance-fee scam example
When the author replied to a phish he received from this broad campaign, he got a reply
from “Shyann Huels,” who purported to be Jeff Bezos’s secretary. Apparently, he was the
lucky recipient of $2 million (for a small handling fee).

Broader Implications
As to the question of why there might still be a few phishes slipping through the net, even
after the NHS took steps to mitigate this campaign, the answer might be found in the
numbers. The NHS is a national organization in Great Britain, and as such, it has
tremendous scope. Not only does nhs[.]net serves tens of millions of individual email users, it
also provides an infrastructure for 27,000 organizations, each with its own technology staff.
These organizations include hospitals, clinics, doctor’s offices, public bodies, suppliers,
services, social-care organizations, and many other related entities.
We found 139 compromised accounts, which may sound like a lot, but that number
represents only a few ten-thousandths of one percent of the total. Given the huge number of
NHS accounts, this tiny percentage could still be expected to produce a few newly
compromised accounts every day.
Perhaps this is a moment to introduce the idea that phish can be like a leak in the boat. It
doesn’t matter that the hole is small. It will still sink the boat eventually. Even if only a few
bad emails get through, with a malicious enough payload, a single successful attack can be
life-altering. The NHS has been lucky so far. Credential harvesting by itself is small potatoes.
But, of course, those credentials can be recycled in subsequent attacks with more dangerous
results.

Recap of Techniques
Brand impersonation — uses brand logos and trademarks to impersonate well-known
brands.
Credential harvesting — occurs when a victim thinks they are logging in to one of their
resource sites but are in fact entering credentials into a dialogue box owned by the
attackers.
Hijacked accounts — are used by phishers to make their emails appear to come from
legitimate senders

Best Practices: Guidance and Recommendations
Email users should always check a sender’s email address carefully and scrutinize any links
in an email by hovering over them. Most emails in this campaign claimed to be from Adobe
or Microsoft, but nhs[.]net is not an Adobe or Microsoft domain. The links in them did not
belong to these organizations, either.
Recipients should also be cautious with unfamiliar new document notifications and decline to
respond to or click any links in an email from a sender who has never been in touch before.
