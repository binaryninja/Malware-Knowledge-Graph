Reaver: Mapping Connections Between Disparate Chinese APT
Groups
threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/reaver-mapping-connections-between-disparate-chinese-apt-groups.html
The Cylance Research and Intelligence Team

When the New York Times published a story in December based on a combination of hacked diplomatic
cables belonging to the European Union, as well as sensitive information belonging to the United
Nations, we, the BlackBerry Cylance Threat Intelligence team, took notice. It was hard not to given that
it ran on the front page (Sanger, 2018)1.
But the story caught our attention for other reasons too. It was based in large measure on a report titled
Phishing Diplomacy, published by Area 1 on the same day (Area 1, 2018)2. The researchers attributed
the compromise of the diplomatic cables and the targeting of over 100 additional organizations
(including foreign and finance ministries, think-tanks and trade unions) to the Chinese government’s
Strategic Support Force (SSF), a Chinese military organization, without any explanation as to how they
arrived at that attribution assessment.
Even more intriguing was the fact that, according to the Times report, Area 1 researchers provided the
compromised cables to the newspaper. The Times quoted extensively from the cables – a move that
raised eyebrows and prompted interesting legal and ethical questions for both Area 1 and the Times.
But legal and ethical questions aside, there was yet another reason why we took notice of this report.
Included in the Area 1 “indicators of compromise” (IoCs) was a single website/domain name they said
the Chinese SSF used for Command-and-Control (C2) in both targeted attacks.
As we will demonstrate in greater detail below, we connected this domain to a host of other, disparate
Chinese APT groups whose tasking, targeting, and toolsets have been literally all over the map. We
also found evidence suggesting that different Chinese APT groups have also been using the same
malware - and in some cases, the same exploit builder.

Analysis
The attribution of forensic artifacts to specific threat actors, at whatever level, is an evolving, dynamic
process - not a static one. Yet, much of the public research that originally defined the “known APT
groups” appears to be frozen in time.
1/13

When private security companies began declaring APT groups and minting an alphabet soup of threat
actors bearing nicknames with numbers, animals, elements, demons and gods, they sketched profiles
of nation states and their proxies by invoking the intelligence-version of a signature.
Pictures emerged that reflected a particular group’s choice of tactics, techniques and attack procedures
– the so-called TTPs that shape the way we tend to think about Iranian, Chinese, Russian and North
Korean threats. This alphabet soup of nicknames engendered consequences not just for risk
management at the enterprise level, but for national security policy as well.
Many of these profiles were sketched nearly a decade ago; however, attribution is as much a function of
a given window of technical evidence as it is a function of a given window of time.
In the case of the forensic artifacts Area 1 associated with China’s SSF, evidence of shared or
overlapping tools by Chinese groups once thought to operate separately or to employ separate targeting
suggests one of several potential developments:
It could indicate that Chinese government groups are expanding their reach beyond traditional
boundaries or have been given different tasking/targeting
It could indicate the Chinese government cyber effort has matured enough such that different
groups – even at different agencies – are now comfortable sharing tools and infrastructure
It could indicate that the Chinese have developed some method of centralizing the activity of
disparate government units for the purposes of coordinating technical access outside of China
Knowing which assessment is correct is probably of more interest to governments than it is to targeted
organizations. Of course, every attack by a suspected state actor holds significance for both groups.
There are always tactical considerations for the target, and there are often national security
considerations for governments, policy makers, and those of us trying to understand the behavior of
nation states in cyberspace.
Still, evidence of a shifting profile of Chinese APT groups offers a lesson for network defenders, as it
impacts the threat modeling and risk assessment of organizations who have positioned themselves
based on:
1. A dated understanding of these groups and their preferred targets, or
2. An explicit reliance on “indicators of compromise,” or
3. Both.
What follows is discussion of our findings, detailing the crossover in malware and C2 infrastructure.
Some, though not all, of these findings were arrived at independently by Anomali Labs, who published
them last month (Anomali Labs, 2019)3. Anomali did not, for example, make the connection to the Area
1 research. And while our findings regarding some of the malware and infrastructure crossover support
those of Anomali, we do not share their conclusion that the crossover portends supply chains or
“quartermasters” shared between strategic rivals China and India.

Discussion
The Area 1 Phishing Diplomacy report that enabled the Times story attributed the attacks on the
European Union and other related targets to China’s Strategic Support Force. The SSF was modeled on
America’s Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), a blended unit that was initially part of Strategic Command
(STRATCOM) before being stood up as its own combatant command.
2/13

The SSF was created in 2015 following a reorganization of several disparate Chinese military units
responsible for space operations, electronic warfare, information operations, psychological operations,
espionage, technical reconnaissance, and network warfare. Included in the reorganization was the Third
Department of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), members of which were famously called out by the
U.S. Justice Department as the threat actors behind the “APT 1” persona.
But while China’s Third Department has been traditionally focused on external operations, typically in
support of military objectives, we found a connection via the infrastructure included in the Area 1 report
to groups associated in other security research with Chinese government efforts to spy on and conduct
operations against internal groups perceived as separatist or threatening to the government – a task
normally left either to the (relatively new) National Security Commission by way of the operations of the
state police or, by extension, the Ministry of State Security.
The Ministry of State Security is a Chinese civilian federal agency thought to be comprised of a
combination of foreign intelligence and domestic intelligence services – sort of a combination of the CIA
and FBI, if thought of in American terms.
The MSS has recently been the target of the U.S. Justice Department, which named the group (and
publicly associated it with APT10 / a.k.a. “menuPass”) in a couple of recent indictments (U.S. vs. Zhang
Zhang-Gui et al, 2018)4 (U.S. vs. Zhu Hua et al, 2018)5 [indictment numbers 13CR3132-H and
18CRM891, respectively]. The MSS was also named by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission as the actor “widely believed” to be “either responsible for, or the ultimate benefactor of,
the OPM breach” (USCC, 2016)6.
Chief among China’s domestic security concerns, and presumably targets of the MSS, have been
groups known informally as the Five Poisons.
The name is a reference to five groups whose ideological, religious, or cultural differences have either
directly challenged the ruling party structure or have put them at odds with the government’s singular
“One China” concept of its national identity. Traditionally, the Five Poisons has referred to:
Members of the Muslim minority of ethnic Uyghurs
Followers of Falun Gong
Supporters of Taiwanese independence
Tibetans
Activists in support of democracy in China
Operations targeting these groups have often employed the use of a malware family identified by Palo
Alto Networks as “Reaver” (Miller-Osborn, 2017)7. Palo Alto also associated Reaver with related
malware known by the names SUTR and SunOrcal in campaigns targeting the Taiwanese presidential
election, as researched by PWC (Yip, 2016)8, and the Five Poisons more broadly as reported by Citizen
Lab (Hardy, 2013)9. We found even newer variants and other as-yet unnamed samples as we started to
dive in further.
Whether Reaver, and its predecessors, are tools wielded by Chinese groups focused internally on
separatist movements, or by a division of the Chinese Army re-tasked to serve the same mission, is
unknown. However, it is clear that the group behind Reaver used some of the same infrastructure as the
group behind the Area 1 attacks on the European Union and United Nations (ostensibly, the military
SSF).

3/13

In its Phishing Diplomacy report, Area 1 published a single C2 domain, updates.organiccrap[.]com,
which previously resolved to the IP address 50.117.96[.]147 between November 16, 2017 and July 27,
2018, a period of roughly eight months.
Exactly one day before that “organiccrap” domain began resolving to that IP address, another domain
was resolving to it, for a narrow period of two weeks (October 31, 2017 – November 15, 2017). That
domain, tashdqdxp[.]com, was included in the Palo Alto research, where they indicated that it was used
in conjunction with Reaver.
We found that several additional, recent Reaver C2 domains also resolved to this IP address including
etwefsfj[.]com, sfafgeht[.]com, and asdasfdsre[.]com. The earliest resolution occurred on May 1, 2018
and the latest on January 10, 2019.
As we mentioned above, Palo Alto had previously linked this Reaver domain and other Reaver samples
via passive DNS to a number of SunOrcal domains. They include:
www.weryhstui[.]com, www.fyoutside[.]com, and www.olinaodi[.]com.
Palo Alto also linked the same SunOrcal activity set to a number of previous reports that shed light on
apparent Chinese government targeting of Hong Kong activists, among others (Brooks, 2016)10,
(Wilson, 2016)11.
The new Reaver variants we found appear to use a hybrid subset of new and old network infrastructure.
We break them down in the following technical section, along with a description of a new backdoor we
discovered along the way.

Technical Findings: Malware
Reaver.v4
The new 2018 Reaver samples continued to operate in a manner similar to what was first described by
Palo Alto as “Reaver.v3 TCP Payload.” The only real difference was in the encoding of the relative
address string lookup table and configuration data.
XOR decoding was abandoned in favor of a custom cipher which used an incrementing right bit shift.
Interestingly, this cipher also did a reverse lookup for values which had previously been computed. The
decrypted table looked very similar to what was previously identified:
RA@10016=ADVAPI32.dll
RA@10017=GetUserNameA
[TRUNCATED]
RA@10313=ChangeServiceConfig2A
RA@10314=QueryServiceConfig2A
Figure 1: Decoded String Look Up Table
The configuration of the malware was also encoded similarly and contained all of the information
previously described by Palo Alto -- with one additional string: a network callback domain, network port,
beacon interval, a service name, service description, service display name, and now two hardcoded
strings “n-0625” and “2017-tq-s”:

Figure 2: Decrypted Configuration Data
The network protocol remained largely unchanged from Palo Alto’s report and will not be covered here,
for the sake of brevity.

Sparkle Payload
During the investigation into the newer Reaver network infrastructure, we identified an entirely new type
of backdoor deployed in very limited instances. BlackBerry Cylance named this payload “Sparkle” to shy
away from the ominous military lexicon commonly “deployed” by the information security industry.
An associated dropper was also identified:
295c942389ebdbf8ff9a8b1a81d3f63cb60577fa57ecaa660ce347666973b4f3
The payload attempted to read data from the file %Temp%\wsm56d1.tmp and communicated to the
domain www.sfeeleyses[.]com on TCP port 443.

Reaver.v4 Downloader
We identified a unique Reaver downloader during our analysis which was coincidentally the only sample
which had a valid PE checksum. This binary would download an encoded payload from
hxxxp://www[.]htuditey[.]com/l-0424.bmp and save it to a file named: w90sD32rS3H2jP75.bmp.
Once saved, the downloader would decode a regular executable dropper from it using an incrementing
XOR routine starting with the value 0xFF at file offset 0x36.
This executable content would be written to disk as %Temp%\mstk.exe, and the downloader additionally
created an associated Run key with it under the current user’s registry hive to establish persistence.
The following python snippet can be easily adapted for other keys as well:
def inc_xor(buf,start):
out = ''
key = int(start, 16)
5/13

for i in buf:
if key < 256:
out += chr(ord(i) ^ key)
else:
key = 0
out += chr(ord(i) ^ key)
key +=1
return out
inc_xor(binary_data, 'FF')
Figure 3: Python Incrementing XOR Routine
The downloader also contained a highly unique PDB path within it as well:
e:\VS2005 Project\Doc_Pack\DownloadSample\release\DownloadSample.pdb
The PDB path suggested that this downloader was likely only one part of a larger malicious document
project.

Technical Findings: Exploit
Malicious Documents Delivering Reaver
After examining the new Reaver malware, we then turned our attention to the delivery method. What we
found was an exploit document leveraging CVE-2017-11882:
9ac09ea38c9cf11ca13a2c3dbdcfbe0fe4a15cb609be451f7159ecebdd20d311
After analyzing this document, we were able to identify a handful of others leveraging the same exploit
that took advantage of the “Package” ActiveX Control to drop a temporary file to
%AppData%\Local\Temp\8.t.
This is a particularly interesting trick that first rose to popularity in 2014 and appears to have dropped off
almost entirely. Simply opening an RTF document is enough to trigger the behavior if the ActiveX control
is not disabled via:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{F20DA720-C02F-11CE-927B0800095AE340}
Upon closing the document, the temporary file will be removed. The native Windows program
“Wordpad.exe” is also capable of triggering this same behavior regardless of the aforementioned
registry key. (Li, 2014)12.
In cases where the exploit was successfully triggered, it would launch some shellcode to decrypt and
execute the content stored within “8.t”. The shellcode within the document utilized a unique custom
XOR cipher with a seed value of “0x7BF48E63” shown in python below:
def mixer(eax):
ecx = eax
ecx = ecx >> 0x1B
6/13

ecx = ecx ^ eax
ecx = ecx >> 3
ecx = ecx ^ eax
eax = eax + eax
ecx = ecx & 1
eax = eax | ecx
return eax
def custom_loop(buf):
eax = 0x7BF48E63
out = ''
for x in buf:
edi = 7
while edi !=0 :
eax = mixer(eax)
edi -=1
xor_key = eax & 0xFF
out += chr(ord(x)^xor_key)
return out
Figure 4: Python Code to Decrypt Contents Stored in Package Object
We were able to locate two additional documents which operated in a similar fashion and retrieved
encoded payloads from www.htuditey[.]com. We confirmed these documents to be directly related to the
group behind the Reaver malware.
We also found several other documents which used the same executable encoding mechanism and
seed value; however, these documents had previously been publicly attributed to “Gobelin Panda”
(Sebdraven, 2018)13 and dropped an entirely different payload named “Sisfader RAT” (Humphrey,
2018)14.
Gobelin Panda, a.k.a. Goblin Panda, is a group that has been identified by CrowdStrike as a Chinese
threat actor known to target defense, energy, and government organizations belonging to South Asian
countries - especially Vietnam. CrowdStrike observed Goblin Panda activity spike as tensions among
South China Sea nations has risen.
Though we are not able to determine whether Gob(e)lin Panda is associated with the MSS or the SSF, it
is clear to us that the exploit builder used in the set of samples we have discussed above has been
shared across multiple Chinese APT groups, including Leviathan, Temp.Periscope and Kryptonite
Panda.
Anomali also published a comprehensive report on this series of exploit documents and termed the
Reaver family “Temp.Trident” (Anomali Labs, 2019)15. [Editor’s note: corrected on May 29, 2019].

Technical Findings: Infrastructure
All the domains we have identified in this report used random combinations of letters and were
registered using the e-mail address yuming[at]nuo.cn, which seems to be a generic address for the
hosting provider (www.nuo[.]cn).

7/13

This provider has a direct link to the Chinese group or groups using or sharing this infrastructure, going
all the way back to 2013, where it was used to register the domain, eyestouch256[.]com. The following
six domains were registered on November 15, 2017:
etwefsfj[.]com
sfafgeht[.]com
strenthuy[.]com
fhjsdkla[.]com
htuditey[.]com
xuitrdgt[.]com
As a reminder, that date marked the last day in which the tashdqdxp[.]com and associated IP was used
in connection with Reaver (according to Palo Alto, which published that information five days later), and
one day before Area 1 says the SFF started using the same IP address with a new domain for the
attack on the European Union.
We found that six other domains were registered on two different earlier dates in 2017 and were likely
not operationalized to quite the same extent. We have not listed them here since they were not relevant
to this discussion.
Then, an additional two domains were registered on August 30, 2017:
djstoern[.]com
jorehkn[.]com
Four other domains were registered on May 9, 2017:
menrotefit[.]com
norejike[.]com
poticxny[.]com
qidaterstu[.]com
We strongly suspect yet another four other domains were registered by the group on July 31, 2018.
However, they either have yet to resolve to any unique IP addresses or we have yet to identify any
malware samples associated with them. Those domains are:
asdasfdsre[.]com
fdvvbnf[.]com
hdjyrtuy[.]com
kiggdssad[.]com

Conclusion
In this Threat Intelligence Bulletin, we’ve demonstrated how, after a close technical analysis of a set of
tools and infrastructure used by several suspected Chinese state or state-sponsored actors over nearly
a decade, we were able to establish and/or confirm connections between them – connections that
provide insight into a dynamic set of actors whose targeting has changed dramatically over the years.

8/13

Interestingly enough, the change in targeting, perhaps a reflection of shared tools or tasking among
Chinese military and civilian intelligence services, was presaged by our own research on this same
subject six years ago.
In 2013, at a time when Citizen Lab and other research groups were issuing reports about the Chinese
targeting of the Five Poisons, we published a technical blog on the use of essentially the same tools
(later called Reaver) in use against U.S. automakers for espionage purposes (Gross, 2013)16.
Findings of this nature should be of concern to enterprise administrators and network defenders in every
vertical, not just those who see themselves within a threat model for the established Chinese state
threat groups. That’s because, as our analysis has shown, we assess that the Chinese threat groups
are either sharing “Indicators of Compromise” or adopting the targets and tasking of other Chinese
groups.
That means that if defenders are overly reliant on blacklisting indicators of compromise, or else making
risk assessments based on what they perceive the interests of Chinese APT groups to be, they will
remain vulnerable to an attacker who is changing both its tools and its targets.
To borrow an analogy from the health industry, defenders should make an effort to vaccinate themselves
in hopes of preventing sickness, not just try to bar entry to everyone they know is sick.
