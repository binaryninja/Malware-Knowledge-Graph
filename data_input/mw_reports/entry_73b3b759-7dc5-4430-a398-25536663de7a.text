Executive Summary
Operation Groundbait (Russian: Прикормка, Prikormka) is an ongoing cyber-surveillance operation targeting individuals in Ukraine. The group behind this operation
has been launching targeted and possibly politically-motivated attacks to spy on
individuals.
This paper presents ESET’s findings about Operation Groundbait based on our research into the Prikormka malware family. This includes detailed technical analysis
of the Prikormka malware family and its spreading mechanisms, and a description
of the most noteworthy attack campaigns.
Key findings:
•

The country where the malware has been seen most is Ukraine.
It has been active since at least 2008.

•

The primary targets of Operation Groundbait are anti-government
separatists in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's
Republics in Eastern Ukraine.

•

There have also been a large number of other targets, including
Ukrainian government officials, Ukrainian politicians, Ukrainian
journalists and others.

•

The attackers most likely operate from within Ukraine.

The discovery
In the third quarter of 2015 ESET identified a previously unknown modular malware family, Prikormka. Further research revealed that this malware has been
active since at least 2008 and the country where the malware has been seen most
is Ukraine. The reason why it had gone unnoticed for so long is the relatively low
infection ratio before 2015. The number of infections surged significantly in 2015.

The low detection ratio and ability to stay undetected for years is a common characteristic of targeted attacks (APTs). The investigation of campaigns and Prikormka activity has increased our confidence that this malware is used in targeted
attacks.
Targeted attacks are generally carried out for various purposes, including reconnaissance, intellectual property theft, sabotage, and espionage. After analyzing
tactics, techniques and procedures employed by this particular malware group,
we came to the conclusion that individuals are targeted rather than companies.
Even when the Prikormka malware was detected in a corporate environment, we
never saw any lateral movement — a technique used by advanced adversaries in
cyber-attacks.

2015

One of the first examples of this malware that we analyzed in our laboratory had
the name prikormka.exe. The Russian and Ukrainian word prikormka (Прикормка)
means groundbait, a type of fish bait that is cast into the water to attract fish. We
used this codename during our research and afterward we decided to keep it, so the
malware has the names Win32/Prikormka and Win64/Prikormka respectively.

We suspect that this group operates in Ukraine, where most of the victims are
located. For that reason and due to the nature of these attacks, we classified them
as cyber-surveillance operations.

Figure 1 shows the number of unique Prikormka samples compiled in each year
since 2008, according to the PE header timestamps. While timestamps by themselves usually are not a reliable indicator, in this case, their accuracy was confirmed by ESET’s LiveGrid® telemetry.

The campaigns
In this section, we will show the most noteworthy and prominent campaigns and
the decoy documents with which they are associated.
Let’s examine detection statistics by country based on our ESET LiveGrid® statistics:

2015

2016

The main infection vector that we identified during our research consists of spearphishing emails with attached malicious executables or with a download link to
a malicious file hosted on a remote server. When the user clicks on a malicious
attachment that is masquerading as a document, the Prikormka dropper displays a
decoy document in order to trick victims and distract their attention, since victims
normally expect to see a document open when they click on an attachment. This
technique works against less tech-savvy computer users; infection success, however, depends on the quality of spearphishing emails. The attacker has a greater
chance to infect the computer when spearphishing letters and decoy documents
are relevant to the victim — in other words, when the victim would not be surprised to receive such a message from someone. Thus, analyzing such decoy documents can reveal information about the intended targets of these cyber-attacks.
Secondly, there is another artefact embedded in each sample of Prikormka malware, that we call the Campaign ID. These Campaign IDs are unique text strings
used to identify specific infections or attempts at infection by the Prikormka
malware operators. The combinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes
reveal information about the intended targets.

Figure 2. Detection statistics for Prikormka malware according to ESET LiveGrid®.

According to our telemetry, Ukraine is the country with the majority of detections
of this malware. In addition, our research revealed that the attackers behind this
malware demonstrate native fluency of the Ukrainian and Russian languages and
comprehensive understanding of the current political situation in Ukraine.
To answer the question of what kind of victims were attacked in the above-listed
countries, we have analyzed the decoy documents used to target them.

So far we have identified more than 80 different Campaign IDs and even more
decoy documents linked to these IDs. It was observed that usually one Campaign
ID is used against one target, which can be an individual, some entity, or group
of people. This means that one particular ID might be discovered on multiple
computers.
A more comprehensive listing of representative campaigns, along with their compilation timestamps and unique Campaign IDs is in Appendix A.
It is worth mentioning that in some cases it is hard to identify intended victims,
especially when the Prikormka malware infections were discovered at the stage
when the malware was already installed and active. However, we have become
aware of some active Prikormka infections on computer networks belonging to
high-value targets, including the Ukrainian government. Other noteworthy targets are mentioned in the following descriptions of Groundbait campaigns.

Campaigns against separatists
Among Prikormka's primary targets are separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Since 2014
this region has been involved in an armed military conflict.
In April 2014 a group of people unilaterally proclaimed independence in two
regions of Eastern Ukraine: Donetsk and Luhansk. In response, the Ukrainian
government classified these two entities as terrorist organizations and, therefore,
the territory of these regions was declared an Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) zone.
In May 11th 2014, the authorities of these self-proclaimed republics held
a referendum seeking to legitimize the establishment of the republics.
A significant number of decoy documents that were used in Prikormka attacks exploited various topics related to the self-proclaimed states of the Donetsk People’s
Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). Moreover, a number of
decoy documents contain private data including internal statistics and documents
apparently used in the internal workflow of these self-proclaimed states. This
fact leads us to believe that operators are intentionally targeting people located
in these two regions. These assumptions are confirmed by our ESET LiveGrid®
telemetry: the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are at the two most infected regions
in Ukraine by the Prikormka malware.
The attackers use social engineering tricks to convince a victim to open a malicious attachment. These tricks include giving provocative or attractive names to
the email attachments. Here are few examples of such filenames:
•

Нацгвардейцы со шприцами сделали из донецкого
мальчика мишень для ракет.exe (From the Russian: National
Guard of Ukraine aimed rockets at boy from Donetsk). Compilation
timestamp: November 5th 2014

•

Последнее обращение командира бригады 'Призрак'
Мозгового Алексея Борисовича к солдатам и офицерам ДНР
и ЛНР.scr (From the Russian: Leader of the Prizrak Brigade Aleksey
Borisovich Mozgovoy's last appeal to soldiers and officer of Donetsk

People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic). Compilation
timestamp: May 24th 2015
•

Места дислокации ВСУ в зоне проведения АТО.scr
(From the Russian: Dislocation of the armed forces of Ukraine
in ATO zone). Compilation timestamp: December 15th 2015

Here are examples of decoy documents that were used in attacks against
separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
•

The first example is an executable with the filename СПРАВОЧНИК
по МИНИСТЕРСТВАМ обновленный.exe (From the Russian:
Ministries directory – updated) that drops a decoy document with a
list of Ministries of the self-proclaimed republic. The Campaign ID for
this executable is D _ xxx. (Figure 3)

•

Here is another example of a decoy document, which was
dropped by an executable named материалы к зачету по
законодательству.exe (From the Russian: Materials for the law
exam). This executable drops several documents including the LPR
temporary constitution and other legal and political documents.
The Campaign ID is L _ ment; the word “ment” is Russian slang for a
policeman. Thus, the attackers demonstrate intimate knowledge of
the Russian language. (Figure 4)

•

Some of the decoy documents use the Minsk agreement topic. Here
is an example of one such document, which comes from a dropper
with the filename Схема демилитаризованной зоны в районе
Шиокино.exe (From the Russian: Scheme of the demilitarized zone
in the Shyrokyne (Shyrokyne written with a typo in Russian)). The
Campaign ID was Lminfin. (Figure 5)

•

Another decoy document even contains a map of the buffer zone
established by the Minsk Protocol. Here is an example, which came
from a dropper with the filename Отвод с 4 участками по
сост на 14.08.exe (From the Russian: Pullout [of heavy weapons]
on 14.08). The Campaign ID was BUR. (Figure 6)

Important note: Most of the Prikormka binaries that seem to have been intended
for use against separatists have Campaign IDs starting with D or L characters. It's
possible that this means Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, respectively. Also, we observed an executable named Заявление Эдуарда
Басаргина 13 октября 2015 года в 15 часов.exe (From the Russian: Eduard Basargin's statement on 13th October 2015 at 3pm), which uses the Campaign
ID RF _ lgm. Since we have identified detections in Russia, the RF prefix could
mean Russian Federation.

Campaign against Ukrainian nationalist political party
All previously mentioned decoy documents were extracted from executables that had
Russian filenames. Ukrainian is the official state language; however, people in Eastern
Ukraine tend to use Russian, as opposed to Western regions, which use Ukrainian.
Some of the Prikormka binaries had names in Ukrainian. For example, we have seen
the filename План ДНР на 21 липня, щодо відводу військ.exe (From the
Ukrainian: The DPR plan for withdrawal of troops on 21st July). Names of attachments in the Ukrainian language might suggest that the receiver of such malicious
letters prefer to speak Ukrainian over Russian. The fact that Prikormka malware
was detected in Western regions of Ukraine strengthens this assumption. The
Campaign ID for this particular executable was Psek, which inclines us to believe
with a high degree of confidence that members of Ukrainian nationalist party
Right Sector (Ukrainian: Pravyi Sektor) were targeted with Prikormka malware.

Figure 7. Decoy document possibly used against members of a Ukrainian nationalist party.

Other campaigns
Separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk and the other targeted high profile victims
weren’t the only targets of Operation Groundbait. We have observed some other
campaigns with interesting decoy documents, but we can't identify the intended
victims solely on the basis of those documents.
Here is an example of a decoy document which was possibly used against a religious institute. The decoy document comes from dropper with filename Новое
слово жизни.exe (From the Russian: New word of life). The Campaign ID was
medium. This choice of Campaign ID may refer to mediumship and spiritualism.

Figure 8. Decoy document possibly used against religious organizations.

Another campaign was discovered in March 2016. This time, the name of the
malicious file was in Hungarian: Önéletrajz fizikai munka 2.pdf.scr, which
translates to English as “CV physical work”. The decoy document dropped by this
file was a person's CV (curriculum vitae or resume), written in Hungarian. This
malicious .SCR file was sent compressed in single archive with two other documents: the CV of the same person in Ukrainian, and a certificate in Hungarian that
confirms that this person is able to perform the physical job. Based on this information it is hard to say who might be the intended target, but the fact its recipient possibly knows Hungarian and Ukrainian makes this campaign interesting.
The Campaign ID was F _ ego.

Figure 9. The Hungarian document that was sent to the victim in a single archive
with the Prikormka malware.

Here is an example of a decoy document, dropped from a file with the name
bitcoin.exe. The Campaign ID in this case was hmod.

Figure 10. Decoy document that explains how to commit credit card fraud.

The Russian text in the decoy document explains, step by step, how to buy bitcoins
using stolen credit cards. The text abounds in slang words often used by Russian-speaking carders. ¹
Another example is a mysterious decoy document extracted from a malware
dropper with the name prikormka.exe. The Campaign ID is 30K _ alfa.

Technical details
In this section, we will describe technical aspects of Prikormka malware, including
malware architecture, C&C communication and detailed analysis of modules used.

Figure 12. Simplified scheme of the Prikormka malware's architecture.

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit

12

The dropper
The dropper is the initial component of this malware, which is usually sent through
email as an attachment. Usually the dropper has a .SCR or .EXE file extension and
is compressed into an archive. In order to trick the victim, the Prikormka dropper
can masquerade as various types of document or self-extracting archive.

The SFX executable can contain one or more decoy documents. For example one
SFX that was dropped by Prikormka contained 24 documents. Of course, the number and size of the decoy documents affects the size of the droppers. The biggest
dropper we identified had a file size of 25MB.
Most of the dropper executables have an embedded application manifest, which
specifies that the executable requires administrator privileges in order to run on
the system. If the user does not have administrator privileges, the system will
prompt for credentials.

Figure 13. Icons used by Prikormka malware.
Figure 15. The embedded application manifest embedded in Prikormka dropper.

When executed, the dropper infects the computer, but also displays one or more
decoy documents. To this end, the malware displays a WinRAR self-extraction
(SFX) archive window. In some cases, the dropper creates a legitimate, non-malicious SFX executable on disk and then launches it. Interestingly, that SFX archive
always has a Russian localized graphic user interface, even in cases where the filename of the dropper is in Ukrainian. The dropper which has a Hungarian filename
does not display this window at all.

Figure 14. The Russian interface of SFX archive.

The dropper needs administrator privileges because of the technique used by the
malware to become persistent on the infected system. Specifically, the malware
uses so-called DLL load-order hijacking in order to start automatically on every
system boot. The dropper saves one of the Prikormka DLL modules to the Windows-directory under the name ntshrui.dll. Because this DLL file is stored in
the Windows directory, it will be loaded on system boot by the explorer.exe
process instead of the legitimate ntshrui.dll file, which is stored in the
C:\Windows\System32 subdirectory. Thus, the Prikormka module hijacks the
order of loading DLL files. This persistency method is not something new; it has
been publicly examined multiple times by anti-malware research community.
Another interesting technique is used by the Prikormka malware, specifically by
droppers with .SCR file extensions. The .SCR file extension stands for screensaver
and represents a standard Windows executable file. The main difference between
.EXE and .SCR is that a screensaver is executed with special command line arguments. Usually, cybercriminals just rename an executable with the .SCR extension
in order to bypass various security measures based on file extension. Prikormka's
authors implemented a check for such command line arguments, so when the

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit

13

binary is executed as a standard executable (without the required arguments),
it won’t infect the system. Thus, this simple check allowed the malware to bypass
some sandboxes used for automatic sample processing.

Earlier versions of Prikormka used a different technique – Campaign IDs were
embedded in the binary file of one of modules:

In the case where the infection starts from a .SCR file, the Trojan uses standard
methods for loading its DLL via rundll32.exe and for maintaining persistence, by
setting an entry with the name guidVGA or guidVSA in the registry Run key:
[HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]
In order to be loaded by the 32-bit and the 64-bit version of Windows Explorer the
malware has binaries for both platforms. Most modules are written in the C programming language and compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio.
The dropper stores modules in its resources; some of these resources are encrypted with a simple XOR operation.

Figure 17. The Campaign ID with value hmyr32 is embedded in the binary.

The Campaign ID value was hardcoded in the Prikormka binary at compilation
time; moreover, the ID in the 32-bit version of binaries ended with 2, while the
Campaign ID in 64-bit version of binaries ended with 4.
This technique was probably efficient for a small number of victims, but it presumably created problems for the attackers once the number of victims grew. Perhaps
recompiling and repacking the core parts of a toolset for every new victim became
too time consuming, so somewhere around mid-2015, the attackers changed
this scheme. Since June 2015 the Campaign ID is stored in a separate file named
rbcon.ini, which the attackers call objectset. The malware authors have also
included a new value called roboconid, which represents the Operator’s ID. Our
investigation allowed us to confirm that this ID is a unique number for the malware operator, who performs cyber operations and is assigned to infect, spy on,
and track a particular target.

Figure 16. Resources located inside the Prikormka dropper binary.

The dropper is responsible for creation of the rbcon.ini file, which used by the
malware to store Campaign ID and other values.

Figure 18. The rbcon.ini file which contains both Campaign ID and Operator ID.

Some of the binaries of the dropper contain a PDB-path, which can reveal the
directory structure used by attackers.

It should be noted that malware operators are responsible for deciding which
modules should be pushed to the infected computer.
Prikormka might store modules with different functionality under similar names
or, conversely, it can store modules with similar functionality under various names.
Some versions of the malware store modules with a filename that contains only
the current date and time. For these reasons we refer to the plugins by code
names in the following text.

Figure 19. Some of the PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka droppers.

The malware writers internally call this Trojan PZZ; we have other evidence that
supports this theory. The Prikormka family is a typical cyber-espionage Trojan
with a modular architecture. The functionality of the Trojan allows attackers to
steal sensitive data from the infected computer and upload them to command and
control (C&C) servers.

Prikormka modules
The Prikormka modules are stored on disk in the infected system in the form of
DLL files. There are modules for various purposes, such as communication with
C&C servers, auxiliary purposes (e.g. persistence), and exfiltration of different
types of sensitive information from the infected computer. As mentioned before,
Prikormka modules are compiled for both 32- and 64-bit Windows platforms.
There is a standard set of downloadable modules with pre-defined names, which
will be described in detail in the next sections. So as to be executed, the module
(DLL file) should be stored under a specific filename on the disk and should have
one of the following export functions: Starting, KickInPoint, Cycle. However,
attackers are able to push any custom module to a particular victim. Specifically,
we observed that custom modules are usually named mp.dll.

The following list contains filenames of modules that were referenced within malware code, but we haven’t seen them during our research and thus were unable to
assess their functionality:

PERSISTENCE module
As described above, this module uses the DLL load-order hijacking technique to
maintain persistence in the system.

•

miron.dll

•

meta.dll

•

hmuid.dll

•

sh.exe

•

hauthuid.dll (CORE)

•

mupdate.exe

•

hlpuctf.dll (KEYLOGGER)

•

atiml.dll (LOGS _ ENCRYPTER)

•

iomus.dll (DOCS _ STEALER)

•

swma.dll (SKYPE)

It is important to note that Prikormka components made in the "old" period (between 2008 and 2010) used a completely different naming scheme. Here are some
examples of such filenames:

When launched, this module creates the folder %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\
MMC and copies the following files there from the %WINDIR% directory:

•

smdhostn.dll

•

helpldr.dll (DOWNLOADER)

•

heading.dll

•

rbcon.ini

•

lgs.dll

•

la.dll

•

lh.exe

•

lp.exe

•

inl.exe

•

lid.dll

This component then loads and passes execution to the CORE module, or to the
DOWNLOADER module if the CORE module is not found.
If the %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\nullstate.cfg file exists, then the
component deletes all the filenames listed above from the MMC directory and
quits, thus deactivating itself.
Some of the binaries of the PERSISTENCE module contain a PDB-path, which reveals the directory structure used by the malware authors at compile time. Three
of these paths contain a time stamp, possibly from when the project was created
or modified. One such path contains the Russian string Раб. программы, which
translates as “computer programs for work”.

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit

16

Along with the Campaign ID and Operator ID, the module includes in the request
a date and time when infection occurred and whether the platform is 32-bit or
64-bit Windows. Some of the binaries of the DOWNLOADER module contain PDBpaths, revealing that internally this module is called Loader or helpldr:

Figure 20. Some of the PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka's PERSISTENCE module.
Figure 22. PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka's DOWNLOADER module.

DOWNLOADER module
The main purpose of this component is to download the CORE module and execute it. The DOWNLOADER module makes an HTTP request to one of its C&C
servers, receives data, decrypts the data, saves it under the name hauthuid.dll
and then loads the DLL. The communication is encrypted with the Blowfish cipher
and then base64 encoded.

CORE module
The CORE module is responsible for communications with C&C servers and other
tasks, including downloading additional modules, loading them, and uploading
stolen data to the remote server.
Since this malware (and specifically the CORE module) has existed for several
years, the details of implementation might vary, but the main concept of the CORE
module has remained unchanged over the years. The concept of the Prikormka
malware is simple: the CORE module downloads additional components, which
are used to harvest various types of data. When such a component is loaded, it
gathers sensitive information and saves this information to some specific log file.
The log file might store collected data in plain-text or it may be encrypted. The
CORE module checks periodically for such log files and when a log is available, it
uploads it to the remote server. The CORE module won’t upload a log file if it is
bigger than 500MB.
In order to store downloadable modules and collected log files, the CORE module
creates two directories:

Figure 21. Traffic captured from the Prikormka malware's DOWNLOADER module.

•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\

•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SKC\

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit

17

The MMC folder is primarily used for additional downloadable malware components; the SKC folder is used for storing collected log files. In the subsequent text
we will use the term “log folder” to refer the SKC directory.
The downloadable modules are not able to upload collected data. In fact, only the
CORE and DOWNLOADER modules communicate with C&C servers. The communication protocol of the CORE module is very similar to that of the DOWNLOADER
module.

It is worth mentioning that early versions of Prikormka stored C&C servers in
plain-text; later, attackers used the base64 algorithm in order to hide the servers’
addresses. Finally, the latest versions of the CORE modules use simple encryption: to decrypt it, the researcher should add the hexadecimal value 0x17 to each
encrypted byte.

Figure 24. Example of simple encryption used by Prikormka to hide C&C servers.

DOCS_STEALER module
This module is responsible for collecting documents from removable media or
fixed drives, connected via a USB interface.

Figure 23. Traffic captured from the Prikormka malware's CORE module.

The only difference between DOWNLOADER and CORE HTTP requests is the st
parameter in the URL. This parameter indicates which of the downloadable modules are active and loaded by Prikormka. With the current implementation, there
is room for 11 additional modules. The server responds with the content of the
module that should be executed, or with a dummy answer.
The logs are uploaded during a POST request to a similar URL:
•

The module focuses on collecting files with document-type extensions: .DOC,
.XLS, .DOCX, .XLSX, .PPT, .PPTX, .PPS, .PPSX, .PDF, .RTF, .TXT, .ODT. However,
it does not collect all files, but only those which were modified in the last 7 days
(or 14, or 30, depending on which version of the module).
The collected files then are compressed, encrypted with Blowfish, and stored
under the following scheme:
•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ioctl\%DISK _ ID%\
%DATE% _ %TIME%.kf

hxxp:/server.ua/wd.php?sn=%DATE _ TIME _ OF _ INFECTION%

KEYLOGGER module

SKYPE module

This module is responsible for collecting keystrokes and the titles of foreground
windows. The collected information is saved to the log folder under the following
names:

This module is responsible for recording Skype audio chats. In order to record
Skype calls, the module uses a legitimate interface, called the Skype Desktop API.
When a third party application is about to use this API, the Skype messenger
displays a warning, which asks the user to allow the access. To bypass this Skype
security feature, the Prikormka module creates a thread that attempts to find the
window and click the “Allow access” button programmatically, without human
interaction.

%DATE% _ %TIME% _ fix.lg

•

lgfix

•

lpl

•

fplid

•

fmmlg

If the log file is bigger than 10Mb, the module removes the log and starts anew.
Some versions of the module encrypt the log file using Blowfish.

SCREENSHOTS module
This module is responsible for capturing screenshots of the victim’s desktop.
By default, the module captures a screenshot every 15 minutes. However, if the
victim opens a VoIP application Skype or Viber, then the period between screenshots is lowered dramatically to 5 seconds. The captured screenshot is saved in the
JPEG format. The collected information is saved to the log folder under filenames
%DATE% _ %TIME%.tgz.scrsh or %DATE% _ %TIME%.stgz.

MICROPHONE module
This module is responsible for recording sound from a microphone. The module
records audio with 10 minutes duration. It stops recording on command, or when
there is no more free disk space available. The recorded audio is encoded with the
LAME MP3 encoder. The collected information is saved to the log folder under the
filename %DATE% _ %TIME%.snm.

Figure 25. The warning displayed by Skype.

The strings and some code fragments in this Prikormka module suggest that the
implementation of this module was partly borrowed from the code published on
the website openrce.org in 2006.

After encryption, the original (but not the encrypted) files are deleted. Results of
the encryption are stored in the following files:
•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\ipl

•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\kpl

The encrypted content is additionally encoded with the base64 algorithm. Interestingly, before the content starts, the module puts an additional signature there:

Figure 26. The string CREATE APPLICATION minishell suggests copied-and-pasted code.

The collected information is saved to the log folder using %DATE% _ %TIME%.skw
and _ skype.log filenames.
Figure 27. The “atKsoft” signature at the beginning of encrypted log files.

LOGS_ENCRYPTER module
This module is responsible for log encryption. The module compresses data via the
LZSS algorithm and encrypts the following log files with Blowfish:
•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\inf

•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\fsh

•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SKC\*.scrsh

•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SKC\*.snm

•

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SKC\*.skw

•

Files listed in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\ierdir.dat

We have not found any legitimate application which can read such files or any
other meaning of this mysterious “atKsoft” signature.

The file ierdir.dat is created by the CORE module; it contains an encrypted list
of files requested by attackers to upload from victim’s computer.

GEOLOCATION module
This module is responsible for geo locating the infected computer. Unlike other
modules, this module is written in the C# programming language. This module
collects information about currently available WiFi networks, including Service Set
Identifier (SSID) and MAC-address. Afterward, the module makes a request to the
Google service, providing collected information as parameters; the Google service
response contains the possible location based on the information supplied.

The collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename
geo%DATE%.inf.
The binary of the GEOLOCATION module has a PDB-path; the structure of this
path is similar to the PDB-path of the DOWNLOADER module:

Figure 29. The PDB-path discovered inside the GEOLOCATION module.

OS_INFO module
This module is responsible for collecting information about the infected computer.
The following information is collected by this module:

Figure 28. Traffic captured from Prikormka malware's GEOLOCATION module.

•

Battery info for Notebooks

•

Windows OS version

•

Computer name and User name

•

IP Addresses and MAC Addresses

•

Physical memory

•

Available disk drives

•

Available printers

•

•

Installed antivirus software

The module uses Windows API functions in order to collect this information.
The collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename
%DATE% _ %TIME%.inf.

PASSWORDS module

FILE_TREE module

This module is responsible for collecting passwords stored in applications installed
on the infected computer.

This module is responsible for collecting information about the file system of the
computer's fixed drives, including paths of files with specific file extensions, their
size and creation time. The actual content of the file is not collected by this module.

The module gathers the application version, logins and passwords stored in the
following applications:

The attackers are interested in the following file extensions:

•

Google Chrome

•

Documents: TXT, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF

•

Opera Browser

•

Archives: ZIP, RAR

•

Yandex Browser

•

Databases: DB, SQLITE

•

Comodo Dragon Internet Browser

•

The Bat! email client: TBB, CFG, CFN, TBN, TBB

•

Rambler Browser (Nichrome)

•

Microsoft Outlook: OST, PST

•

Mozilla Firefox

•

Other: DAT, WAV, EXE

•

Mozilla Thunderbird

For some reason, this module does not collect passwords for Microsoft Internet
Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers. Because the Yandex Browser and the
Rambler Browser are popular mostly in Russian speaking countries, we think that
it indicates that this module was designed for use against users located in such
countries.
The collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename
%DATE% _ %TIME%.inf.

Since The Bat! email client is popular in Russian-speaking countries, the fact that
malware is focused on file extensions associated with this email client is another
indicator that the malware is created with the intention of using it against Russian-speaking users.
It should be noted that the list of all file extensions does not represent the list
found in any particular sample. This list contains all the possible file extensions
that we observed in different versions of the FILE_TREE module. The attackers
might build a custom version of this module for a specific victim. The collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename %DATE% _ %TIME% _ tree.
inf. Some binaries of FILE_TREE modules have PDB-paths; one such path reveals
the username of the malware writer.

C&C servers

During our investigation we obtained access to an Operation Groundbait C&C
server that was misconfigured and allowed a public directory listing.

During our research into Operation Groundbait we have observed a number of
C&C server domain names and IP addresses. Most of them are located in Ukraine
and are hosted by Ukrainian hosting providers. Appendix B contains a more comprehensive listing.
One of the C&C servers, gils.ho[.]ua has been in operation since 2008, according to information from the hosting company. In order to hide their illegal activity,
the attackers created a bogus website. The website is dedicated to the capital of
Ukraine—Kiev.

Figure 32. Operation Groundbait C&C server
directory listing.

Figure 33. The internal directory structure
of a subfolder.

At one point, the root directory contained 33 subdirectories, with an individual
folder for each victim. This means that the server was used to control 33 Prikormka-infected computers. The name of each sub-folder contains an Operator ID,
a Campaign ID and the architecture of the infected device.
Each folder contains two sub-folders with the following names: data and util.
The first folder contains encrypted exfiltrated data and the second folder has
encrypted Prikormka modules.

Figure 31. Bogus website created by attackers.

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit

23

In addition to the data and util folders, each victim-specific subfolder contained
two plain-text log files: journal and log, revealing interesting findings about the
malware operators and their victims.
The log file contains the communication log between the server and the infected
computer: specifically, the IP address of the infected computer, date and time, type
of request (GET or POST), the size of request, and the status of Prikormka modules
(in cases where it is a GET request).

Figure 35. The content of the journal file located on an Operation Groundbait C&C server.

According to our analysis of the communication logs from one server there were
33 victims, located mostly in Eastern Ukraine. In addition to those, there were
a few victims located in Russia or in Kiev, Ukraine.

Figure 34. The content of one log file located on the Operation Groundbait C&C server.

The analysis of logs revealed that several malware operators connected to the
server using various internet service providers in Kiev and Mariupol. Some of them
accessed the C&C via the Tor network.

The journal file contains the communication log between the server and the
malware operator. The communication log contains the IP address of the operator,
the date, time, and type of request. It should be noted that once downloaded by
the malware operator, the file with exfiltrated data gets removed from the server.

Attribution
In this section we make an attempt to identify the origin of the threat based on
clues that were intentionally or unintentionally left by the attackers:
•

Most of Prikormka's C&C servers are located in Ukraine and hosted
by Ukrainian hosting companies

•

The group behind this threat has fluent knowledge of the Russian
and Ukrainian languages, as evidenced by text in the decoy
documents and malware binaries

•

Some of the PDB-paths revealed that attackers used directories with
names in Russian

•

All analyzed Prikormka droppers contained language codes that
correspond to Ukrainian (hexadecimal code 0x0422) or Russian
(0x0419) languages in their PE resources (Figure 37)

•

The compilation timestamps of Prikormka binaries suggest that the
malware authors operate in the Eastern European time zone

•

According to C&C server logs, a number of malware operators
participating in Operation Groundbait have been making
connections through various internet providers in two Ukrainian
cities: Kiev and Mariupol.

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit

25

Interestingly, the droppers from earlier period (2012-2015) do contain resources
with Russian language codes. The malware authors gradually switched from Russian to Ukrainian in the mid of 2015.

We can deduce from this that the malware authors work from 6.00 to 16.00 (UTC),
sometimes staying late in the evening. This corresponds to the period 8.00 to 18.00
Eastern European Time, which would include normal Ukraine working hours.

Figure 38 depicts the distribution of the compilation hour of Prikormka samples.

Based on our research and the abovementioned facts, we conclude that the attackers behind Operation Groundbait are people with an interest in surveillance
or spying on separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and a few specific
high-profile targets, including Ukrainian politicians. The malware operators and/
or authors have a knowledge of the Ukrainian and Russian language, and likely
operate from within Ukrainian borders.

Conclusion
Our research into these attack campaigns and the Prikormka malware itself suggests that this threat is the first publicly known Ukrainian malware that is being
used in targeted attacks.
In terms of technical advancement, the attackers didn’t demonstrate any sophisticated methods or novel techniques. But whether an attacker uses sophisticated
methods or not does not matter as long as they reach their ultimate goal: stealing
the sensitive information they need from their targets.
The most noteworthy achievement accomplished by the attackers behind
Operation Groundbait is that they have stayed under the radar for over 7 years.
The malware has been seen in the wild since at least 2008. This finding is confirmed by the timestamps of binaries, ESET telemetry, and by hosting providers used.
Operation Groundbait is, after BlackEnergy and Operation Potao Express, yet another
demonstration that that using highly targeted malware for espionage amidst an
armed conflict is an everyday reality.
Indicators of Compromise (IOC) that can be used to identify an infection can be
found in Appendix B or on github.
