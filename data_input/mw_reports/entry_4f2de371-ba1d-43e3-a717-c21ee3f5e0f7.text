3 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Introduction
Ransomware cemented its position as the most
prominent cybersecurity threat faced by organisations
across geographies and sectors, with increased
momentum and impact throughout 2021.
PwC serves more than 200,000 clients in 156 countries. We
use our vantage point as one of the largest and most global
professional services networks to deliver one of the most
global threat intelligence services to our clients. Our research
underpins all of our security services, and is used by public
and private sector organisations around the world to protect
networks, provide situational awareness, and inform strategy.
This annual report documents the overarching and thematic
trends we observed in 2021, and is part of our contribution to
help build a secure digital society.

in cybersecurity conversations, with issues surrounding their
research, disclosure, and exploitation attracting greater public
scrutiny. These arose particularly in relation to indiscriminate
targeting and issues of national security, as threat actors of
all motivations and capabilities rushed to exploit high-profile
vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon and Log4Shell. The abuse
of 0-day exploits also interlinked with two other phenomena:
the impact of digital quartermasters on the cyber threat
landscape (including that of commercial quartermasters), and
surveillance activity against civilian targets.

Affiliate programmes and Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
schemes fostered further growth of the cybercrime threat,
and its hidden impact on lives was increasingly laid bare as
schools, charities, public services, and critical infrastructure
often bore the brunt of indiscriminate targeting. These
schemes streamlined compromise-to-profit pipelines –
providing financial incentives, reputation-based deals, and
even furnishing operators with resources such as step-bystep intrusion playbooks. At the same time, ransomware
schemes continued to strengthen mutualistic ties to the
cyber criminal ecosystem surrounding them, including
malware delivery systems (like TrickBot, IcedID, and QakBot),
underground forums facilitating ransomware affiliate
recruitment, and Access-as-a-Service (AaaS) markets.

Intelligence gathering operations, for the most part, remained
aligned with geopolitical events. However, in 2021, more than
any other year so far, we identified new and emerging clusters
of activity pursuing objectives aligned with specific countries’
strategic interests, including threat actors likely based
in countries from which we had not previously observed
offensive cyber activity originating.

While 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, its
spread throughout the world and it’s impact in cyber space, a
major trend in 2021 was the proliferation of cyber capabilities.
0-day vulnerabilities resumed as a major concern discussed

The analysis in this report was conducted by the PwC Threat
Intelligence practice, which is distributed across Australia,
Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom, and
the United States. It is based on our in-house intelligence
datasets on cyberattacks and targeting from a wide variety
of threat actors, intelligence gleaned from PwC’s incident
response engagements around the world, and our managed
threat hunting services, as well as publicly available
information.

A perfect storm:
0-days, quartermasters,
and surveillance

5 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Year of the 0-day
0-day vulnerabilities, and particularly their research and
disclosure, have been an ever-present topic of interest in
the cybersecurity community. In 2021, several high-profile
events, including highly targeted operations as well as mass
exploitation of vulnerabilities, brought this topic yet again to
the fore of strategic and tactical discussions, and into the
public eye.
Rather than treating 0-days as an insurmountable threat, in
this section we provide strategic context of this phenomenon.

Day by (0)day: a strategic overview of the
zero-day landscape
Discussions about 0-days often revolve about the difficulty of
avoiding them, based on the perception they might be even
harder to defend against. In 2021, we saw coverage of this
topic spilling into the mainstream, together with other highprofile topics like supply chain targeting (in the wake of the
SolarWinds incident) and ransomware (following attacks on
entities like Colonial Pipeline). The year 2021 also registered
the largest number of 0-days disclosed in a single year1,
almost doubling 2020’s figures. The reasons behind this
surge are nuanced, and likely the result of a combination
of factor, including:
•	A more overt element of national security: While 0-days
have been abused for years, 2021 saw several political
displays of “0-day diplomacy”; that is, discussions about
their usage on a national security level. As an example,
Germany’s newly elected coalition made a political
statement on the embargo of government purchase of
0-days, citing their “highly problematic relationship to IT
security and civil rights.”2 The Cyberspace Administration
of China (CAC) announced new laws surrounding
domestic vulnerability disclosure.3 The new law also
applies to vendors, which must ensure any vulnerabilities
are mitigated in a timely manner and promptly disclosed
to customers along with fixes, and encourages private
organisations to set up bug bounty programs to financially
incentivise vulnerability research.
•	The market for 0-days has expanded: Over the past
few years, there have been an increasing number of
players operating in the vulnerability research space:
from individual security researchers, to 0-day criminal
brokers, to private espionage companies such as Hacking
Team, FinFisher, NSO Group, and Candiru. Exploit
brokers and private sector organisations, particularly, are
among the most prominent players with regards to 0-day
development and trading.

•	More incentives than ever before: There are now
increasing avenues for vulnerability researchers to
compete and earn financial rewards for their exploit
development work. These can be legitimate, such as the
Tianfu Cup and Pwn2Own, or illegitimate, as has been
the case with offensive research contests launched on
Russian-language dark web forums.4 With this activity
firmly rooted in the offensive security world, defenders
have had to respond, dedicating resources to their own
exploit development work for identification and disclosure
purposes, such as with Google’s Project Zero.5
•	A renewed focus on third-party infection: Threat
actors with a variety of motivations have begun targeting
organisations involved in supply chains, often enabling
access to multiple targets at once. This has led to an
investment of resources into vulnerability research of
widely used business technologies, such as email servers,
or knowledge management software as key examples.
This naturally increased the amount of 0-days discovered,
and, with their disclosure (even where responsible and
accompanied by vendor fixes and advisories), the amount
of attempts at exploiting those very vulnerabilities.
Ultimately, preventing 0-days is not a trivial matter for software
developers and vendors, let alone for their customer base.
However, customers and defenders should not underestimate
the capabilities and measures that can be put in place with a
focus on detection and response to post-exploitation behaviours
and activity. Coupled with robust core security hygiene, a solid
detection and response function can make a difference in the
impact that new 0-days might have on organisations.

An overview of quartermaster
activity
The way threat actors procure and provision tools can affect
not only attribution, but, more importantly, their capabilities
and ability to pursue new target pools. The concept of a digital
quartermaster is not new when it comes to cyber operations,
but remains increasingly relevant. Quartermasters have been
traditionally associated with supplying technology to military
units. Consequently, digital quartermasters are more often
thought of in the context of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
actors gaining access to capabilities only shared among a
select group of threat actors, or obtaining tools from a central
entity in charge of distributing them and enabling their use.
However, PwC also defines the companies that sell
offensive security solutions such as spyware, 0-day exploits,
and related capabilities, to entities that then operate
them as ‘Commercial Quartermasters.’ While traditional
quartermasters often only provide tools to threat
actors based in the quartermaster’s own country,
customers of commercial quartermasters might be
based in several countries.

6 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

APT quartermasters
While it is not always possible to prove, the hypothesis that
multiple APT groups operate under, or are resourced by, the
same digital quartermaster cannot be ruled out for various
sets of threat actors. In 2021, we continued to observe
this phenomenon, whether through observations of shared
capability (malware, techniques, exploits, and so on), or
through overlaps in infrastructure (either through the same
patterns observed on C2s, or the reuse of domains/IPs by
other threat actors).

Of Shadows and Proxies: China-based threat actors
sharing tools

The continued sharing of tools and techniques is a running
theme among China-based threat actors. While not all of the
China-based threat actors share tools with one another, and
not all of them have access to the same tools, quartermaster
arrangements (covered in more detail in a later section)
continue to complicate attribution of activity. For example,
the same malware families (such as PlugX, PoisonIvy,
ShadowPad, Quarian, and the Winnti backdoor) are used by
multiple China-based threat actors, and, as has become very
well known in 2021 with the ProxyLogon incidents, some
threat actors share exploits as well.
We note that while not all of these threat actors have been
observed having access to the shared tools detailed
below, these are prime examples of the dynamic
described in this section.

ShadowPad and Scatterbee

ShadowPad is a modular backdoor that allows a threat actor
to customise the functionality delivered in an implant. Every
ShadowPad sample that we have seen has a root module
designed to orchestrate the next set of modules, including a
plugins module that can then be customised depending on
the functionality that the threat actor requires. The plugins
can enable capabilities that may include, among others, C2
communications over HTTP or TCP, keylogging, screenshot
gathering, port mapping, and system information gathering.6
In tracking “standard” ShadowPad samples in 2021,
we identified and analysed a new variant, which we
call ScatterBee: samples of ShadowPad that had been
obfuscated using a custom technique.7 Likely in order to
minimise detection on victim networks, the ScatterBee
packing mechanism implements control flow obfuscation,
string encoding, dynamic API resolutions, several antianalysis techniques, as well as shellcode decoding/
decrypting. We assess that one or more users of ShadowPad
have access to ScatterBee, and have highly likely delivered
some of these malicious payloads via watering hole attacks
on sites that are used to deliver Adobe Flash update files. We
assess that most ScatterBee payloads can be directly linked
back to the threat actor we track as Red Dev 10 (aka Earth
Lusca), and have been used to target organisations in the
aerospace and defence sectors.
We assess ShadowPad to be highly likely used by at least
11 China-based threat actors.8 Our analysis into specific
subsets of ShadowPad infrastructure allowed us to identify a
wide set of victims, ranging from India-based entities in the
telecommunications and oil and gas sectors, to East Asian
branches of international humanitarian organisations.

“Exchanging” Exchange: ProxyLogon

a set of malicious PDF documents targeting the higher
education sector. This targeting did not normally align with
Yellow Liderc,12 but matches that of Yellow Garuda (aka
Charming Kitten, APT35, PHOSPHORUS, TA453, and ITG18).
We have previously noted infrastructure overlaps between
these two threat actors, raising the hypothesis that Yellow
Liderc is an offshoot of Yellow Garuda.13 Based on several
similarities between these threat actors, we assess there is
a realistic probability that an operator has either spanned or
transitioned between the two during 2021.

As we have already highlighted, it is not uncommon for these
threat actors to share tools. However, the rapid sharing
of these exploits ahead of the patching of the Microsoft
Exchange vulnerabilities was unprecedented.

Commercial quartermasters

In early 2021, Red Dev 13 (aka HAFNIUM) began exploiting
vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, which became
collectively known as ProxyLogon.9, 10, 11 While the initial
activity surrounding ProxyLogon was associated exclusively
with HAFNIUM, at the end of February/beginning of March
2021 (close but prior to the time of the first public disclosure
of these campaigns), multiple China-based threat actors
started exploiting the same vulnerabilities, on a mass scale
versus precise targeting.

Iran-based developers working across multiple APTs

Threat actors are typically identified by the capabilities,
infrastructure, targeting, and general TTPs they display.
However, developers or operators behind campaigns working
across multiple threat actors can muddy analysis and
attribution.
This can occasionally be the case with Iran-based threat
actors. For example, through researching phishing campaigns
by Yellow Liderc (aka Tortoiseshell, TA456), we identified

Commercial quartermasters differ from companies defined
as hack-for-hire, like CyberRoot and BellTroX.14 Hack-for-hire
companies are tasked with doing the actual hacking on behalf
of a paying client, while commercial quartermasters only offer
tools paid for by the client, which then are used by the client
themselves to do the hacking. Early examples of commercial
quartermasters include Hacking Team and FinFisher, both of
which were at the centre of considerable public outrage and
have since rebranded or gone bankrupt. Despite the fallout
from these companies’ activities, PwC continues to observe
threat actors, particularly those running surveillance operations,
leveraging commercial quartermasters and their capabilities.15

8 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

The recent public spotlight on commercial quartermasters like
NSO Group and Candiru has provided insight into a relatively
secretive and growing industry that has implications for
cybersecurity professionals and potential victims, including:
•	difficulty in attributing threat actors that would otherwise
not be capable of conducting such sophisticated
operations;
•	rapid enablement of a country to target both the private
and public sector with advanced malware, such as a
company, government body, or its personnel; and,
•	the potential abuse of these tools to target journalists,
activists, and civil society.
Additionally, the tools produced by commercial
quartermasters are almost certainly used against a wide
array of targets, which may also include government officials
and private sector executives, warranting attention by
organisations that might not think these types of threat actors
fit within their threat profile.

An ever-watchful eye:
surveillance and civil society
Whether armed by the rise of exploit brokers and surveillance
software vendors, enhanced through quartermaster
arrangements, or performed by state-sponsored groups,
surveillance of civilian targets poses a significant threat to
achieving a secure digital society for all. Minorities, civil rights
activists, dissidents, politicians, and journalists, as well as
civilians more broadly, frequently fall in the crosshairs of such
state-sponsored espionage activity. Civil society targets often
also include NGOs, social movements, coalitions, and faithbased organisations that may share common interests.
While surveillance activity often focuses on a person of
interest, organisations associated with those individuals are
sometimes found to be victims, where the organisation is
considered a stepping stone to access the intended target.
This factor is useful for contextualising threats to civil society
as a shared problem.

Powering surveillance: from hacker-for-hire to
commercial quartermasters
Candiru

In July 2021 Citizen Lab,16 Microsoft,17 and Google18 all
exposed to varying degrees a commercial quartermaster
called Candiru, which we track as Grey Mazzikim (aka
SOURGUM). According to Microsoft, the actor’s spyware
is alleged to have been deployed against over 100 victims.
Several domains associated with campaigns we tracked
in 2021 indicated clear targeting of human rights activists
and journalists; others aligned more with strategic interests
of a nation-state, such as energy exports or government

organisations. The spyware sold by Grey Mazzikim is highly
sophisticated and can infect and monitor iPhones, Androids,
Macs, PCs, and cloud accounts.19 Once a target is infected
with the spyware, the operator can exfiltrate the victim’s
private data from a number of apps and accounts including
Gmail, Skype, Telegram, and Facebook, along with capturing
browsing history and passwords.20 The threat actor might
also be able to turn on the target’s webcam and microphone,
or take screenshots.
Since Candiru is a supplier to multiple threat actors
throughout the world, the complexity and scale of these
attacks is quite extensive. In efforts to maximise coverage of
and categorise these threats, PwC tracks Candiru as Grey
Mazzikim and its customers, which currently consist of at
least four different threat actors, separately where possible.21
There are a wide range of targets, but with a distinct focus on
Europe and the Middle East.

NSO Group

NSO Group, which PwC tracks as Grey Anqa, was founded
in 2010. The company is most widely known for its spyware
called Pegasus, but also offers a range of other products,
including geolocation software for cell phones and data
analytics systems. Its primary services and product offerings
focus on mobile devices and networks. Pegasus is known to
infect the most recent versions of popular mobile operating
systems via zero-click and 0-day exploits, including one of
the most sophisticated exploits ever documented, known as
FORCEDENTRY.22, 23
NSO made headlines on multiple occasions for selling its
Pegasus spyware to nation-states that ultimately abused the
tools to spy on civil society.
The recognisable similarities between Grey Anqa and Grey
Mazzikim are many: similar type of company, operating from
the same country, recruiting from the same talent pools, with
a similar customer base. In both cases, the readily available
offensive capabilities for purchase highlight an industry that
enables a consumer to wield sophisticated tools that have
also been abused in targeting civil society on an international
scale.

Pulling the plug: reaction to commercial
quartermasters

2021 thrust commercial quartermasters into the public
spotlight, and into courts of law in multiple countries. For
example, several US technology companies are bringing
lawsuits against commercial spyware providers on behalf of
their customer base, and in some cases seeking to restrict
the defendants’ access to the companies’ hardware and
software. In 2021, we also observed the first high-profile
action against commercial quartermasters at a state level: the
US Commerce Department placed NSO Group and Candiru
on its Entities List, citing a significant risk of them acting
“contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of
the United States.”24

9 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

A first consequence of such action has been, for example,
the Israeli government’s move to restrict by two-thirds the
list of countries to which Israeli security firms are allowed to
sell surveillance and offensive hacking tools. As highlighted
earlier, we note that commercial quartermasters operate
in several countries internationally, with numerous brokers
active in Europe25, 26 and in the US.27
The likely enduring existence of commercial quartermasters
brings forth a fresh set of challenges. It is relatively easy for
a country to purchase bespoke and highly sophisticated
offensive tooling that elevates the country’s capabilities to
that of an advanced persistent threat. The high sophistication
of commercial quartermasters, together with their budgets for
research and development, also implies their ability to retool
while maintaining high operational security standards, both of
which allow for end-users to continue to operate even after
public exposure.

Advanced Persistent Watchers:
APT surveillance activity
Red Dev Redemption

Red Dev 3 (aka DeepCliff, RedAlpha) is a threat actor active
since at least 2015, which was first exposed in open source
in 2018 by CitizenLab as targeting a specific community.28
Throughout 2021 we observed Red Dev 3 set up hundreds of
domains hosting credential phishing pages aimed at diverse
pools of targets on an international scale.29
Red Dev 3’s domain naming convention imitates popular mail
service providers, and the threat actor may also spoof login
portals for the specific mail services of the organisations it is
targeting. 30

Red Dev 3 also targeted or spoofed services including news
outlets popular among diaspora communities and dissidents;
NGOs with a focus on refugees as well as civil and human
rights, such as Amnesty International; and think tanks and
policy institutes.
Since April 2021, we observed a broadening focus of the
threat actor’s targeting from civil society to government
entities, including Ministries of Foreign Affairs in at least
five countries, as well as several government and political
organisations worldwide.31 However, the threat actor also
continued to brazenly and persistently target individual
citizens and vulnerable communities, in relation to sensitive
political and social topics.

Red Nue’s new antics

Red Nue, active since at least 2017, is known for its use
of the multi-platform LootRAT backdoor, also known as
ReverseWindow.32 LootRAT has variants for Windows33 and
Macintosh34 (reported in open source as Demsty), as well as
an Android variant known as SpyDealer.35 Red Nue has also
used another Windows backdoor36 known as WinDealer37
since at least 2019, when it deployed it to targets as part of
a watering hole campaign on a Chinese news website for the
Chinese diaspora community.
In 2021, we observed the threat actor continue to iterate
on LootRAT, deploying a Linux variant of the backdoor.38
The new sample of the backdoor had the binary’s comment
section stripped, likely in an attempt to make analysis and
understanding about the threat actor more difficult. All the
victims that we observed from this campaign were based
in Asia, and included a technology company providing
simulation software.

The high sophistication of commercial
quartermasters, together with their budgets
for research and development, also implies
their ability to retool while maintaining high
operational security standards, both of which
allow for end-users to continue to operate
even after public exposure.”

10 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Parts of Asia feature heavily in Red Nue’s victimology. The
threat actor has targeted individuals and universities with the
Demsty MacOS variant of LootRat. For example, SpyDealer
(the Android version of LootRAT) has the ability to steal
information from over 40 mobile communications apps,
including WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Sina Weibo,
Tencent Weibo, and Oupeng Browser, many of which are
widely used in China.

White Dev 75 targeting Middle East and North Africa

White Dev 75 has been active since at least 2015, and PwC
has determined that this threat actor is likely espionagemotivated. Its observed victims are primarily civil society
members, who are likely being targeted in relation to political
topics. White Dev 75 continues to be highly effective in
compromising email accounts of journalists, dissidents, and
politically-involved individuals located throughout the Middle
East and North Africa.39, 40, 41
Between at least April and October 2021, White Dev 75
registered dozens of new phishing domains that align with
previous tactics and procedures observed in its campaigns,
including one impersonating the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of a Middle Eastern country. White Dev 75 is particularly
effective due to its ability to bypass MFA and leverage
convincing social engineering techniques. The phishing
emails White Dev 75 often uses are fake security alerts of
abnormal login behaviour. The threat actor has also been
observed abusing OAuth to circumvent MFA and passwords
all together.42 OAuth is a common application allowing
authentication of third-party services without the need to
share passwords. The observed TTPs of White Dev 75 are
not overly advanced but demonstrate a persistence and
cleverness in its tradecraft that allows it to perpetrate these
tactics against civil society.

version of LootRAT) can steal

Yellow Garuda’s domestic surveillance

Yellow Garuda (aka Charming Kitten, PHOSPHORUS, ITG18)
is a versatile Iran-based threat actor which has been active
since at least 2012. It was highly active throughout 2021,
conducting a range of activity in a surveillance capacity.
We found evidence that Yellow Garuda conducted a targeted
domestic surveillance campaign to extract data from a
victim’s Telegram account.43 This included the exfiltration
of messages, media files, details of group memberships,
and the victim’s contacts. Between September and October
2021, the threat actor compromised at least six Iran-based
victims, based on data obtained by PwC along with copies
of the actor’s bespoke Telegram ‘grabber’ tool which was
used to exfiltrate the data from victim accounts. We also
uncovered an operational report written by the threat actor
itself concerning surveillance on a seventh domestic victim;
the data from this victim was more extensive and likely the
result of exfiltration via mobile malware.
The addition of mobile malware in Yellow Garuda’s toolset
has been reported in open source44 and correlates to our
own analysis of an Android malware sample with multiple
links to known Yellow Garuda infrastructure in early 2021.45
This sample masqueraded as the messaging application
WhatsApp and included the ability to record audio and video,
take photos, access contacts, location data and SMS, and
initiate calls. Its functionality and codebase was similar to
an older sample of Android malware from 2018 which was
reportedly used to target Iranian citizens, indicating that
Yellow Garuda has likely had this capability for some time.

Ransomware
Ransomware remained the most significant cyber threat
faced by most organisations in 2021. The contributing factors
behind the ongoing trend remain applicable, with many
amplified by the following observations:
•	the number of threat actors engaged in ransomware
operations increased, powered by the rise in prominence
of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) arrangements and
affiliate schemes;

The overwhelming majority of ransomware incidents were
financially-motivated, with a limited set of attacks likely to
have been politically-motivated and intentionally destructive.
In 2020, approximately 1,300 ransomware victims had their
data exposed on leak sites. This almost doubled in 2021, with
2,435 victims exposed.

•	the pace and frequency of publicly reported attacks
almost doubled; and,
•	leaking of stolen data, or the threat to do so, became
standard procedure for the majority of high profile threat
actors adding privacy, regulatory, and reputational risks
to the crisis of business disruption caused by data
encryption.

in activity under a new “brand”, as detailed in later sections.
For example, in Q1 2021 PwC observed 17 threat actors leak
data on approximately 440 victims, but 65% of these attacks
were attributable to only five threat actors:
• White Onibi (aka Conti) - 23%
• White Dev 70 (aka Avaddon) - 12%
• White Apep (aka DarkSide) - 10%
• White Ursia (aka Sodinokibi, REvil) - 10%

In Q2 2021, the number of threat actors observed

ransomware families, with approximately 60% of incidents
attributable to only four operations:
• Conti - 22%
• Avaddon - 18%
• REvil - 13%
• DarkSide - 6%
We assess that the notable reduction in DoppelPaymer
operations in Q2 2021 was likely due to the threat actor
rebranding its operations, before introducing the ransomware
variant known as “Grief”.

caused by the expulsion of affiliate programmes from their
main recruitment sites, and the voluntary dissolution of some
operations following high profile attacks. However, the most
significant event impacting the ransomware marketplace
during this period was the re-emergence of White Janus (aka
LockBit) as LockBit 2.0 in July 2021. LockBit’s original affiliate
programme was inactive from late 2020 and did not reemerge until July 2021, on the criminal forum RAMP, as White
Janus reworked its ransomware.46 The threat actor quickly
established a high tempo operation, accounting for nearly
40% of observed incidents in Q3. This was likely the result of
attracting affiliates from other ransomware schemes which
closed down at the end of Q2 or the beginning of Q3. Overall
in Q3, there were 32 threat actors leaking data accounting for
almost 600 victims, with 64% of incidents again attributable
to just four ransomware operations:
• LockBit - 38%
• Conti - 16%
• BlackMatter - 5%
• Grief - 5%

In Q4 2021, the pace of attacks increased, with approximately
850 victims added to the tally of observed incidents. As with
the previous quarter, the number of threat actors leaking
data grew once more, with 35 leak sites active during the
period. LockBit and Conti continued to dominate and 64% of
observed incidents were attributable to just five actors:
• LockBit - 29%
• Conti - 21%
• White Thalia (aka Pysa) - 6%
• Grief - 4%; and,
• White Caerus (aka AvosLocker) - 4%
A spike in observed activity by Pysa was the result of an
influx of data leaks on 10th November, which was more likely
the result of the threat actor updating its often-neglected leak
site rather than a surge in Pysa operations from that particular
period.

Sector breakdown

Ransomware operations are largely indifferent to the
economic sector of organisations, although since the
pandemic took hold, many threat actors have made public
statements – to which they have not entirely adhered – that
they would avoid targeting hospitals or other healthcare
facilities. Where targeting objectives have been specified by
threat actors, their focus has purely been on the size of the
organisation (number of endpoints), its geographical location
(with an emphasis on Canada, the EU, US, and UK) and its
revenue.47 As in 2020, few sectors were immune to attack,
but some sectors experienced attacks more frequently than
others, with the top six sectors accounting for 60% of all
incidents noted:
• Manufacturing - 18%
• Retail and Consumer - 11%
• Technology - 9%
• Construction - 8%
• Financial Services - 7%
• Professional Services - 6%
The same top six sectors accounted for 66% of ransomware
incidents in 2020.

We have not seen evidence that these sectors are specifically
targeted by threat actors. However, if the healthcare sector
is not included, these six sectors are a close match for the
top six industry sectors by revenue in the United States.48
For some of the most active threat actors – for example
White Onibi – victim revenue is an important factor when
determining whether to proceed with post-exploitation
activity after initial access has been achieved. This may have
some influence over the distribution of victims by sector.

60%

of all incidents noted were
comprised of six sectors
(Manufacturing, Retail and
Consumer, Technology,
Construction, Financial Services,
and Professional Services)

Incident response case study:

HSE

The Republic of Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE)
commissioned a report by PwC on a Conti attack that disrupted
HSE IT systems in May 2021. The HSE published this report
on 10th December 2021, marking one of the first global
instances of ‘full disclosure’ following such an incident.49
On 14th May 2021, Conti ransomware was activated on
over 3,500 workstations and 2,800 HSE servers, causing
widespread and protracted disruption to healthcare services
in Ireland, with some healthcare facilities unable to access
patient data or schedule appointments via electronic
systems. The origins of the attack dated back to March
2021, when a user opened a malicious attachment that had
been delivered via email. There was a significant time gap
between initial access to the network being achieved and
post-exploitation activity. This was likely the result of the
initial compromise being carried out by an Access-as-aService (AaaS) operation, before Conti assumed control of
the compromised endpoint to progress the attack.

Conti is a “human-operated” ransomware system and is
deployed through the manual execution of batch commands,
rather than a malware that propagates through a network
automatically, indiscriminately encrypting any infrastructure
it encounters. The Conti operation followed known TTPs
associated with the threat actor, including the deployment
of Cobalt Strike to facilitate lateral movement and privilege
escalation within the network; the use of other tools,
including Mimikatz, to identify and compromise administratorlevel accounts and systems, particularly Active Directories;
and, the exfiltration of data prior to the encryption of files.
The impact of the attack could have been much greater if
Conti had been activated on medical systems as well as the
victim’s core IT estate. Many of the factors that contributed to
the scale and impact of the incident are not unique to HSE.
The report highlights lessons that all organisations need to
consider in order to prepare for a similar cyberattack and to
ensure they can mitigate and recover from one.

17 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Affiliate programmes
Affiliate programmes continued to be a driving force
behind the scale and pace of ransomware operations
in 2021. Ransomware affiliate programmes generally
offer access to a specific ransomware strain on a profitsharing basis. In this scheme, a main threat actor, such
as White Ursia, is responsible for the development and
management of the malware, and it provides access
to its affiliates, whose role is to conduct attacks. The
funds extorted from victims are divided between the
ransomware operators and their affiliates in pre-agreed,
profit-sharing arrangements. This enables threat actors
with network intrusion and exploitation skills to acquire
access to ransomware and monetisation capabilities they
could not easily develop themselves, reducing the barriers
to entry.
Many of the most prolific ransomware operations, such
as DarkSide, REvil and LockBit, openly ran ransomware
affiliate schemes (Партнёрская программа); others, such
as Conti, recruited “pentesters” without specifying their
ultimate objectives. Affiliate programmes were mainly
promoted in Russian-speaking criminal forums like
Exploit and XSS. As the number and quality of affiliates
(адвертов) were a defining factor in the revenue generated
by many ransomware operations, competition between
rival schemes intensified. Threat actors boosted their
profile by:
•	depositing large sums of cryptocurrency in their forum
accounts, to demonstrate the financial success of their
scheme;
•	conducting media interviews promoting their
operation’s success and revenue, many of which
attracted positive coverage in the criminal forums
where they recruited affiliates;
•	posting links to media stories about their operations;
•	offering competitive profit-sharing arrangements to
their recruits; and,
•	by claiming technical superiority over their
competitors.

Getting political: legal and regulatory response
A series of incidents affecting mainly US organisations in the first half of 2021 significantly raised the profile of ransomware:

In early May, a DarkSide affiliate carried out an attack on Colonial
Pipeline, which impacted fuel supplies across the East Coast of the
US. The fallout of the incident prompted an emergency declaration
by the Federal Government which relaxed restrictions on road
transportation of fuel to the DC area and 17 US states. 53, 54
On 14th May, a Conti attack on
the Irish Health Service Executive
caused significant and protracted
disruption to several hospitals and
the wider healthcare network.55

In early July, a REvil supply-chain
attack on the US-based software
company Kaseya significantly
increased scrutiny of ransomware
operations.57, 58

The US Treasury Department
took action against a number of
cryptocurrency exchanges suspected
of involvement in the handling of
ransom payments, converting them
into fiat currency on behalf of threat
actors.59

Two more REvil suspects were
arrested in Romania. An additional
suspect, residing in Russia,
was indicted by the US Justice
Department and designated for
sanctions by the US Treasury
Department.

Mass expulsion of affiliate
schemes
Increased focus and pressure on
ransomware systems, especially
as a consequence of the Colonial
Pipeline incident, had an immediate
impact on affiliate schemes. On
14th May, the administrators of the
criminal forum XSS deleted posts
relating to:
• Affiliate scheme recruitment;
• the rental of ransomware; and
•	the sale of locker (ransomware)
software.
Although the administrators cited
several reasons for their actions, a
key point was that ransomware had
become “dangerous and toxic…and
was being linked with geopolitics
and state-sponsored attacks.” The
other principal forum where affiliate
schemes were operating, Exploit,
also followed suit, citing similar
reasons for its own ban.61
The ban on affiliate schemes
did not result in an expulsion of
ransomware threat actors from the
forums themselves, although some
did withdraw. For example, White
Ursia announced that it would close
its REvil affiliate scheme and “go
private”; it subsequently canceled
its forum memberships altogether.
White Apep announced that it
would shut down the DarkSide
ransomware operation, and released
decryption keys for the malware.62
However others, including White
Janus (aka LockBit) retained their
membership, and simply transferred
their affiliate recruitment activities to
their leak site.

While overt affiliate recruitment
schemes were the subject of the
ban, the recruitment of “pentesters’’
continued without much disruption,
with adverts in the “seeking work”
or “freelance” sections of Exploit
and XSS largely unaffected. The
adverts did not openly state that
recruitment was being conducted
for ransomware operations, but the
job specifications for many of the
vacant positions bore similarities to
previous affiliate scheme recruitment
campaigns.

RAMPing it up
In response to the forum bans on
affiliate recruitment, in mid-July a
criminal forum was created that
claimed to specifically cater to the
needs of ransomware operations
and affiliate programmes in
particular. The site initially operated
from the dark web address
previously used by White Dev 72
(aka Babuk) for its leak site, and
called itself RAMP, possibly intended
as a reference to an earlier Russianlanguage dark web site that was
involved in the sale of narcotics.
The forum has a section specifically
devoted to RaaS schemes as well
as adverts recruiting pentesters
and access to corporate networks.
Prominent ransomware schemes
currently active within RAMP include
Conti, AvosLocker, and BlackCat.

Figure 16: Affiliate recruitment adverts on the RAMP forum

Ransomware rebranding
As another likely consequence of increasing legal and
political pressure, in 2021 we observed one of the
highest levels of ransomware rebrandings in recent years.
Ransomware rebrands have three main benefits:
•	allowing for established cybercrime threat actors to
“reboot” their programme after suffering a setback.
(for example, after the discovery of a flaw in their
ransomware’s encryption routine results in the publication
of a decrypter for the malware);

•	providing an opportunity to lay low and reduce the
spotlight on a specific group after a significant amount of
activity or campaigns; and,
•	preventing or delaying the attribution of attacks, where the
threat actor perceives this to be an operational advantage.

22 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Incident response case study:

New job, who this?
Ransomware
operator changes
affiliate schemes

In February 2021, PwC’s incident response team responded
to a Sodinokibi/REvil attack on a France-based organisation
in the agriculture sector. The intrusion began in mid-January,
when a malicious attachment, delivered to the company’s
employees via a phishing email, led to the installation of
QakBot on a victim workstation.
After achieving initial access, the threat actor deployed Cobalt
Strike to strengthen its presence in the victim environment.
It also started accessing LSASS credentials, relying on the
Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally
across the network. The threat actor used a mix of BITS
jobs, PowerShell and command-line interaction to install and
execute payloads and fingerprint the network. RClone, open
source software used to manage content on cloud storage
systems, was used to exfiltrate data from the victim’s local and
cloud storages, before the ransomware was detonated.

Although the threat actor ultimately deployed Sodinokibi/
REvil ransomware, the way it operated within the victim
environment aligned more closely with techniques known to
be adopted by affiliates of another ransomware programme
which PwC tracks as White Samyaza (aka Egregor, Prolock).
For example, while QakBot has also been observed leading
to REvil infections63, it is more strongly linked to White
Samyaza operations64. The command-line tool RClone is
frequently, though not exclusively, used by Egregor/Prolock
operators, particularly with the utility being renamed as
“svchost.exe” to blend in with the victim environment65.
Additionally, the ransomware files observed during the
incident response were labeled using the victim’s name.
This naming scheme is a characteristic unique to Egregor
ransomware and is not typically observed in Sodinokibi/REvil
ransomware (whose files are often named using a random
naming scheme).

Based on the evidence we examined, we assess it is highly likely that an affiliate of White Samyaza moved to White
Ursia, and deployed Sodinokibi/REvil using TTPs commonly observed with White Samyaza affiliates.

23 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Blue Lelantos

In December 2019, members of the Russia-based crime
group “Evil Corp” (tracked by PwC as Blue Lelantos) were
indicted by US authorities and designated for sanctions.66 Evil
Corp operations continued throughout 2020, but changes
to Evil Corp operations became apparent by the end of that
year and increasingly noticeable in early 2021. Detections
of WastedLocker,67 one of Evil Corp’s principal ransomware
systems, all but disappeared in late 2020. However, the
WastedLocker operation continued throughout 2021, through
a succession of rebrands. In late 2020, WastedLocker ransom
notes began appearing as Hades ransomware, Phoenix
Cryptolocker in March, Payloadbin in June, and Macaw in
October.68 Similarly, DoppelPaymer,69
Evil Corp’s high profile “double extortion” operation,
effectively ceased operations in May, with the last victim
added to its leak site that month. In June, a new ransomware
calling itself “Grief” or “PayorGrief” emerged and began
posting victim data on its leak site from the outset. Analysis
of Grief samples revealed extensive coding similarities
between it and DoppelPaymer, with a major change being
Grief’s use of the cryptocurrency Monero for ransom
payments. We assess that Grief is yet another rebranding
exercise by Evil Corp, and is unlikely to be its last.70

Although we have no direct evidence of the reasons for
the successive rebranding exercises undertaken by Evil
Corp in 2021, we assess it is highly likely that these are a
consequence of the group’s designation as a sanctioned
entity by the US authorities:
•	As with most ransomware operations, the majority of its
victims are in the US;
•	An organisation making or facilitating a ransom payment
to a sanctioned entity would potentially place them in
breach of US sanctions and therefore less likely to pay;
•	Rebranding WastedLocker and DoppelPaymer made
it more difficult, in the short term at least, to attribute a
ransomware incident to a sanctioned entity; and,
•	Rebranding existing code, rather than writing new
ransomware variants from scratch, reduces Evil Corp’s
opportunity costs and the time required to maintain its
ransomware operations.

White Apep

DarkSide (aka BlackMatter), which PwC tracks as White
Apep, has been in operation since at least August 2020,
and had already undergone two rebrandings by the close
of 2021. The first came in January 2021, two months after
the launch of DarkSide’s affiliate programme, when security
company Bitdefender developed and publicly released a
decryption tool 71 allowing DarkSide victims to recover their
files. White Apep operations went on hiatus, likely to allow the
threat actor to retool, and only resumed on 9th March 2021
under the rebranded banner of “DarkSide 2.0”. Its return was
accompanied by a relaunch of its affiliate programme, and
featured an updated version of the ransomware designed to
avoid decryption by the existing tools.72
It was after this first rebranding that one of DarkSide’s
affiliates conducted one of the most damaging incidents
observed in 2021, the successful attack on US-based
Colonial Pipeline on 7th May. The attack led to a shutdown of
operations on its 5,500 mile pipeline, used to supply almost
half of the US East Coast’s fuel. Increased focus on DarkSide
by the US government, and a subsequent infrastructure
takedown, led the threat actor to announce in mid-May that it
would be shutting down operations.73

24 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

White Apep’s second rebranding came in late July, in the
form of a new RaaS system titled “BlackMatter”. The new
ransomware shared parts of its code, though not all, with
DarkSide 2.0; these included code routines implementing
privilege escalation, victim fingerprinting, and networking
capabilities.74
Growing pressure from law enforcement led to White Apep
once again announcing its departure from the ransomware
scene in November 2021. The decision was shortly followed
by the US Justice Department announcing a US$10m
reward for any potential information on the group. 75 At the
end of 2021, White Apep operations remained inactive.
However, given the number of transformations White Apep’s
ransomware and overall operations have undergone, we
assess that there is a realistic probability that this shutdown
of operations is a chance for it to remain under the radar, only
to re-emerge with yet another rebrand. There is circumstantial
evidence that ALPHV-ng (aka BlackCat), which is currently
tracked by PwC as White Dev 101, is yet another rebrand.
The threat actor’s affiliate scheme was launched on RAMP
on 9th December 2021, and PwC’s incident response team
has responded to multiple BlackCat incidents conducted by
a specific affiliate who was previously part of the BlackMatter
scheme.

White Ursia

White Ursia was one of the most active ransomware
threat actors in the first half of 2021. The public face of its
operation, using the online identities ‘UNKN’ and ‘Unknown’
on Exploit and XSS respectively, maintained a high profile,
conducting interviews and promoting REvil’s affiliate
programme. It is likely that mounting pressure on White Ursia,

after it found itself the subject of greater scrutiny following
the Kaseya and JBS attacks, initiated its first offline move in
2021. ‘UNKN’ had already announced the decision to “go
dark” following the expulsion of affiliate programmes from
XSS and Exploit in May. White Ursia’s “Happy Blog”, the leak
site used to publish compromised victim data, went offline
in mid-July, as did its ransom payment infrastructure. REvil
operations ceased and ‘UNKN’ no longer posted comments
on XSS or Exploit after 4th July. The shutdown of REvil’s
payment infrastructure, as well as the disappearance of
‘UNKN’ damaged the reputation of the threat actor.
In September new online personas – ‘REvil’ on Exploit and
‘0_neday’ on XSS – announced that, following ‘UNKN’s’
disappearance, they had been able to restore REvil
operations from backups. White Ursia resumed operations
and posted data on six victims between 10th September
and 14th October, before the site went down again, this time
probably for good. ‘0_neday’ claimed to have lost control
of REvil infrastructure following a suspected cyberattack
targeting the threat actor personally and had decided to lie
low. On 14th January 2022, the FSB announced that they had
detained 14 suspects and searched 25 premises connected
with an investigation into the REvil operation. 76 Although
at least some of the arrests occurred in early 2022, it is a
realistic probability that elements of the REvil operation
had been disrupted by the Russian authorities prior to the
action taken in January 2022. Several criminal threat actors
in XSS speculated that UNKN’s disappearance in July and
subsequent “radio silence” was also the result of FSB action.
However, it is impossible to verify these claims.

Supply chain compromise: the new normal
Supply chain attacks have long been a tried and tested formula used by multiple threat actors. While they are
traditionally associated with state-sponsored threat actors, financially motivated threat actors have also been
successful in exploiting them. In early 2021 White Austaras (aka TA505), the threat actor in control of CL0P
ransomware, was able to compromise multiple organisations that were using the legacy file transfer software
Accellion FTA. White Austaras exfiltrated data from fewer than 25 victims, and threatened to expose it on the
CL0P leak site if a ransom was not paid.77, 78
In July 2021, White Ursia compromised multiple organisations that were clients of Kaseya, a US company
specialising in network and IT management software, by abusing the company’s VSA software to deliver
malicious payloads. The attack was on a much greater scale than the Accellion incident, with as many as 1,400
organisations affected by REvil/Sodinokibi ransomware.79

25 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Delivery and access
Delivery systems
Malware delivery systems have proven to be a vital
companion to ransomware threat actor arsenals. These are
pieces of software specifically designed to house malicious
payloads, which are later dropped by the threat actor to
gain an initial entry onto a target system or network. In 2021,
with both established players and new entrants active in the
malware delivery market, cyber criminal threat actors had the
option to flit between several and determine the most reliable
and dependable option for their operations.

Emotet

Emotet, which PwC tracks as White Taranis, is one of the
most prominent and long-running malware delivery systems.
Early 2021 saw an international law enforcement takedown,
named Operation LadyBird, of Emotet’s botnet infrastructure.
The operation, which saw over 700 devices used for Emotet’s
C2 systems seized, alongside arrests made in Ukraine,80, 81
impeded the threat actor from conducting its malicious spam
and spear phishing email campaigns for a significant portion
of the year.
However, in mid-November PwC observed Trickbot, the
banking trojan operated by the group PwC tracks as White
Magician, delivering malicious Emotet binaries to infected
Trickbot machines, and executing them in memory. This was
likely an attempt by the threat actor to help restore Emotet’s
command and control infrastructure. This technique is in line
with similar activity associated with White Taranis, where
Emotet was used as a means to help deliver Trickbot binaries
after a similar takedown of Trickbot occured in October 2020.
Alongside the delivery of Emotet binaries and the return of
its command and control infrastructure, we also saw the
introduction of two new spam delivery botnet servers, Epoch

4 and Epoch 5. This added to the three other botnet servers,
Epoch 1, Epoch 2, and Epoch 3, which were previously used
by White Taranis to infect machines. Further updates were
also observed to Emotet’s encryption capabilities, used to
encrypt network traffic, and to its communication protocols.82
These additions to Emotet’s arsenal underscore the
significant capabilities that White Taranis has access to,
and the continued threat it poses to organisations.
The absence of Emotet during most of 2021 saw a significant
proportion of its client base forced to look at other forms of
malware delivery. In 2021, malware delivery systems such as
Buerloader, Bazar, SquirrelWaffle, and IcedID all significantly
increased their activity, which was likely the result of the gap
Emotet left following its takedown.

Colder than IcedID

The threat actor that PwC tracks as White Khione is behind
the malware delivery system IcedID (aka Bokbot), which is
associated with high profile ransomware systems such as
Conti and Sodinokibi/REvil. First identified in 2017, IcedID
was originally developed as a banking trojan, capable of
stealing financial information. However, similar to other
banking trojans, IcedID was later repurposed as a piece of
modular malware designed to provide remote access to
networks, which would later be sold to other users as part of
the “Access as a Service” model.83 In 2021, IcedID stepped
up its capacity in Emotet’s absence, proving one of the most
consistent malware delivery systems. Its core capability lies
within its consistent email spam campaigns, which are used
to initiate the infection chain. Further capabilities include
remote code execution and web browser injection, which
enables IcedID to perform person-in-the-middle attacks with
the intended goal of extracting financial information. However,
IcedID is typically used to deploy further-stage payloads such
as Cobalt Strike.

Access as a Service (AaaS)
Delivery systems, like Emotet and IcedID, have
consistently been the choice of initial access for many
cyber criminal threat actors. However, their availability
and accessibility can be unreliable, with some systems
being forced offline, while others require a long standing
relationship in order to gain access to the malware
delivery services. This has provided leeway for the Access
as a Service (AaaS) marketplace to grow in 2021. These
marketplaces allow the buying and selling of access to
compromised hosts from a wide range of organisations
and sectors, usually in the form of RDP and VPN
access, as well as webshells. Various Russian-language
criminal forums such as Exploit and XSS, and dedicated
marketplaces such as Odin and MagBo, are used to
advertise access listings.84
A primary driver behind the rise in AaaS is the lower
barrier of entry it provides for new threat actors. AaaS
removes the need for threat actors to conduct complex
intrusion or widespread phishing campaigns to gather
credentials. With AaaS, the initial intrusion has already
been completed, enabling the purchaser to transition
straight into post-exploitation activity and ransomware
deployment. In 2021, we witnessed several prolific
ransomware threat actors or their affiliates making use
of AaaS as a means of initial access, including White
Janus (aka Lockbit 2.0) and White Apep (aka BlackMatter,
DarkSide).

political and/or national strategic objectives) to
financially-motivated activity: both targeted and
opportunistic. As in 2020, we continued to see the

Asia-Pacific

Hard drive to survive
In North Korea, a centrepiece of Kim Jong-un’s political
doctrine is the country’s continued development of its nuclear
force, accompanied by a focus on national finances. Overall,
cyber operations have highly likely been one of the North
Korean state’s main avenues for thwarting the impact of
international sanctions and achieving its strategic objectives.
Cryptocurrency in particular is a crucial source of income for
North Korea’s regime, with multiple North Korea-based threat
actors targeting organisations and individuals involved with
cryptocurrency, particularly cryptocurrency exchanges, since
at least 2017.85

Bitcoin is silver, compromise is gold: the
newest North Korea-based threat actor(s)
Throughout 2021, we observed two main clusters of activity
that we assess were highly likely conducted by North
Korea-based threat actors, and which targeted entities
dealing with cryptocurrency and the financial sector on an
international scale. We initially tracked these two clusters
separately, respectively as Black Alicanto (aka Dangerous
Password, LeeryTurtle, CryptoMimic, CryptoCore, Operation
SnatchCrypto)86, 87 and Black Dev 2 (aka Operation Gold
Hunting, Operation SnatchCrypto). Ultimately, overlaps in
capabilities, infrastructure, and victimology led us to assess
that Black Alicanto and Black Dev 2 are likely to be the
same North Korea-based threat actor. We further assess this
threat actor to be highly likely an evolution of Black Artemis’
(aka Lazarus Group, HIDDEN COBRA) financially-motivated
subgroup Bluenoroff.
Below, we present Black Alicanto and Black Dev 2
individually to give an overview of the differing TTPs that we
associated with the two clusters of activity.

Black Alicanto

Black Alicanto is financially-motivated, and has been active
since at least 2018, targeting cryptocurrency organisations
and entities in the financial services sector. While this threat
actor often used lure documents themed around employee
promotions or bonuses to induce targets into opening the
payload, between September and December 2021 we
observed Black Alicanto using lure documents presenting
job descriptions for roles in companies in the finance and
cryptocurrency sectors, including Goldman Sachs, J.P.
Morgan, Commerz AG, SALT Lending, and Blockchain
Intelligence Group.88
Black Alicanto initially sends targets spear phishing emails
with attached compressed archives. These typically contain
double-extension documents (.LNK files masquerading
as Word or PDF documents) or, password-protected lure
documents and malicious LNK files called Password.txt.lnk.
The link files abuse Bit.ly URL-shortened links to lead the
target to download malicious scripts from domains registered
by the threat actor. Black Alicanto is careful to ensure that
only actual targets, as opposed to security researchers,
receive its payloads, and manually deploys later-stage
payloads only to those.
One such payload is msoRAT89, 90, a remote access trojan
(RAT) that Black Alicanto manually deploys on victim systems
of particular interest. msoRAT is an evolution of a backdoor
that has been used for years by BlueNoroff.91, 92

Black Dev 2

Since at least August 2020, we tracked a cluster of activity
that we initially referred to as Black Dev 293, primarily
targeting entities in the cryptocurrency and financial
technology (FinTech) space, as well as venture capital
(VC) firms, particularly ones funding cryptocurrency- and
technology-related ventures.

Investments

Financial Services

The intrusions we associated with Black Dev 2 typically
involved lure documents themed around a venture capital
presentation or company pitch, or around non-disclosure
agreements. The lure documents fetched a malicious remote
template from a threat actor-registered domain. The remote
template’s macros would download a further payload –
typically a malicious backdoor and victim profiler dynamic
link library (DLL) - to be injected into another running process.
In timelining the creation and last modification times of
malicious documents created by Black Dev 2, we identified a
pattern matching that of an average working day, starting at
around 8am and trailing off at around 6pm with a one or twohour lunch gap in the middle, matching the GMT+9 timezone,
which includes North Korea.

We also observed Black Dev 2 using a malware family that
is likely a variant of msoRAT, on infrastructure overlapping
with other msoRAT C2 servers used by Black Alicanto.94
Based on the similarity in infrastructure setup and intrusion
chains adopted by Black Dev 2 and Black Alicanto, and their
common victimology, we assessed it likely that Black Dev 2
and Black Alicanto are the same North Korea-based threat
actor, and an evolution of Bluenoroff.

Complementary missions

The BravePrince update

Beyond the imperative to continue generating funds for
the regime, established North Korea-based threat actors
have continued pursuing targets aligned with North Korean
strategic objectives.

Black Banshee

In 2021, Black Banshee’s (aka Kimsuky, Velvet Chollima) core
sectors of interest remained in line with the threat actor’s
historic targeting, and included:
• government and public sector;
• diplomacy and policy, including think tanks;
•	academia (with particular attention to nuclear research
and international policy);
• defence and aerospace;
• nuclear; and,
•	targeting of civil society and specific groups such as
journalists, NGOs, and religious groups active in relation
to North Korea.

In 2021 we observed Black Banshee maintaining its focus
largely on these priorities, and revamping tools from its
previous arsenal in pursuit of its regional targets. For
example, Black Banshee developed an updated version of
its BravePrince backdoor, and used it to target South Korean
victims.95 The BravePrince backdoor acts as a victim profiler,
keylogger, and information stealer, exfiltrating victim data over
the South Korean email service Daum. The backdoor also
has the ability to exfiltrate specific files of interest to Black
Banshee, suggesting not only direct operator interaction
with the implant, but also that the threat actor deployed the
backdoor specifically to targets of interest. The campaign
focused on South Korean entities; it likely aimed to attain
diplomatic, political, and military intelligence about South
Korea’s stance in relation to North Korea, China, and Russia,
as well as the United States. An update about this campaign
published in November 202196 also detailed targeting of
aerospace and defence material, as well as scientific research
in specific fields such as aviation fuel.

Nuclear policy for BabySharks

Black Banshee also continued to run BabyShark campaigns
for the most part of the year97, maintaining its long-standing
focus on nuclear, policy, and diplomacy topics. We identified
and notified at least eight victims who Black Banshee had
compromised since August 2021. These included diplomatic
figures; current or former senior analysts at think tanks
focused on the Asia-Pacific region; senior academics
focusing on Asia-Pacific history, policy, and defence; and,
employees at NGOs focused on the Korean peninsula. This
targeting also aligned with previous campaigns operated
by Black Banshee since at least late 2018, when we first
observed the threat actor starting to target individual figures
working at supranational organisations including the United
Nations.

Black Artemis

Black Artemis (aka HIDDEN COBRA, Lazarus Group)
continued heavily targeting the aerospace and defence
sectors as part of a campaign that we track as ShowState.98
The campaign persisted in 2021, relying on social
engineering and spear phishing documents themed around
job opportunities for aerospace and defence, expanding to
include engineering and manufacturing companies.99
A different campaign by Black Artemis in 2021, which
targeted South Korean entities, also involved malicious
documents with macros being used to achieve initial access.
However, in this set of intrusions, the macros would drop to
disk a PNG image containing malicious data in compressed
format, making it harder to detect statically by antivirus
software. The macro would then convert the PNG image to
a BMP file, and execute it via mshta.exe. The embedded
executable payload, a malware family we have called
PaintJob100, shares similarities with the encryption routine
used by Dtrack, a well-known RAT which we attribute to the
Black Artemis subgroup known as Andariel.
Black Artemis also persistently targeted offensive security
and vulnerability researchers throughout the past year. In
January 2021, Google101 and Microsoft102 reported a monthslong social engineering campaign relying on Twitter profiles
posing as security researchers, as well as on accounts on
LinkedIn, Telegram, Discord, and Keybase. Black Artemis
would reach out to targets under the false pretense of
collaborating on a vulnerability research project. It would then
send them a Visual Studio Project backdoored with malicious
code executing the Comebacker dropper, that would
ultimately lead to the installation of the Klackring backdoor.

The threat actor also maintained a security blog acting as a
watering hole, and would direct targeted security researchers
to it during conversation. When the targets visited the site,
a 0-day Chrome exploit would lead to a malicious service
being installed on their machine, together with an in-memory
backdoor. Black Artemis could then exploit the access it had
gained to security researcher systems to identify and steal
offensive security research of interest.
A parallel effort by Black Artemis included specific targeting
of Chinese offensive security researchers with Chineselanguage malicious lure documents.103 Compromise attempts
against security researchers also involved a trojanized
version of IDA Pro104 - disassembly software widely used
in cybersecurity research and particularly in vulnerability
analysis and exploit development.

A year of China-based threat
actor activity
Planning ahead
We have continued to observe significant China-based
threat actor activity. Some of these threat actors, like Red
Djinn, are focusing on specific industry sectors such as
semiconductors, artificial intelligence, healthcare (which
includes genetic research and biotechnology), quantum
computing, and exploration across space, maritime, and
polar arenas.105 Others like Red Kelpie are pursuing (and in
some instances enabling others to conduct) significantly
broader targeting.
Beyond economic strategic objectives, we also continued to
observe espionage-motivated activity focused against the
public sector; Red Vulture (aka Ke3chang, APT15, APT25,
NICKEL) and Red Keres (aka APT31, ZIRCONIUM) are both
prominent examples of this kind of targeting focus.

Red Djinn

The China-based threat actor that we track as Red Djinn (aka
BlackTech, Mobwork, Palmerworm) remained active in 2021,
using known tools (such as PLEAD and TSCookie), and new
ones (such as Consock, FlagPro and SpiderRAT).

32 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

In early 2021, we observed a series of Red Djinn campaigns
using malware families known as PLEAD and TSCookie,
including Linux variants of both backdoors to widen the
variety of systems it could target. The targeting of these
campaigns was on organisations based in parts of Asia, and
included an IT and telecommunications company. The threat
actor registered domains themed around cloud and VPN
technologies, and the malware families contained campaign
IDs likely indicating the targeting of the manufacturing and
engineering sectors.

New Djinn

While Red Djinn has historically and consistently focused on
targeting Asia’s largest economies, we have also previously
observed broader targeting by the threat actor. For example,
the threat actor previously targeted an overseas subsidiary
of a managed service provider (MSP) to perform an ‘islandhopping’ attack to laterally move to the MSP’s main network.
Through our tracking of Consock106, 107, a custom Gh0stRAT
variant associated with Red Djinn (also known as
Gh0stTimes) we were able to identify the malware’s controller.

Figure 20: Times.exe, the controller for Red Djinn’s Consock malware

33 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Figure 21: Times.exe was originally designed for
Chinese-language systems

This reconnaissance mainly consisted of the threat actor
browsing the websites and perimeter services (e.g. VPN,
email) of targeted organisations. There has been evidence
that the threat actor is mass scanning for vulnerabilities
in public facing infrastructure.112 Red Vulture’s success in
targeting victims in 2021 was often due to its prolific use of
exploits against perimeter authentication systems (e.g. VPNs).
The observed reconnaissance was focused around the
targeting of Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs), with a
consistent focus on Europe and South America.113, 114, 115

Red Keres

In early 2021, the German Federal Office for the Protection
of the Constitution (BfV) reported on Red Keres’ targeting of
institutions including “ministries and authorities, political
organisations and foundations” across Europe.116

We also uncovered spear phishing lures used by the threat
actor to deliver both Consock, and also a new malware
family which we named Flagpro.108 We assess that Red Djinn
highly likely used Flagpro in its targeting of the subsidiary
of a Japanese IT Services provider and software developer
operating across East and South Asia.
In our analysis of that campaign, we identified a series of
exploit scripts which we assess were highly likely being
used by Red Djinn for its operations. Metadata revealed
some of them to have probably been taken or adapted
from open vulnerability databases, such as Seebug. These
were accompanied by folders containing data suggesting
that Red Djinn had been performing reconnaissance for
vulnerable systems on an international scale. In addition,
we identified exploit code for Citrix and Mikrotik appliances
that appeared to be still in development.109 We also identified
Red Djinn activity dating back to March 2021, exploiting the
ProxyLogon vulnerabilities, after their initial disclosure, to
deploy a new backdoor which we call SpiderRAT.110, 111

Red Vulture

Red Vulture ramped up its operational tempo throughout
2021. We observed Red Vulture conducting regular
reconnaissance on a variety of organisations across the year,
across the following sectors:
• Government;
• Aerospace and Defence;
• Education; and,
• NGOs.

Analysing Red Keres infrastructure disclosed by the BfV, we
also identified evidence suggesting that the threat actor had
likely compromised, and was directly accessing, the email
server of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a Southeast Asian
government between at least December 2020 and February
2021.117 Around the same time, we observed similar activity
involving the email server for the Ministry of Defence of a
different Southeast Asian government.
In late 2021, France’s Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des
Systèmes d’Information (ANSSI) released a detailed report
into Red Keres TTPs. The report detailed the threat actor’s
multilayered anonymisation infrastructure set-up, involving
over a thousand Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) routers,
a technique PwC has observed multiple other China based
threat actors invest in throughout 2021. The report also
highlighted the many different techniques that Red Keres
deploys when attempting to gain initial access to a victim,
ranging from spear phishing, to password brute-forcing and
abuse of valid credentials, to exploitation of vulnerabilities
such as ProxyLogon or in Virtual Private Network (VPN)
products.

34 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Red Kelpie

The threat actor that we track as Red Kelpie (which has
overlaps with APT41 and BARIUM) relies on a wide variety of
malware families including ShadowPad and CROSSWALK, as
well as commodity tools like Cobalt Strike. It is prolific in its
targeting, which encompasses several strategically
important sectors.

ChaChaLoader

In 2021, Red Kelpie conducted a series of campaigns using
the threat actor’s well-known loader Motnug, and a likely
evolution called ChaChaLoader. Motnug and ChaChaLoader
were used to load Cobalt Strike, and in some rare cases,
a newly observed backdoor which has been called
SIDEWALK in open source, and which is a likely evolution
of the CROSSWALK backdoor.118 It is plausible that the few
cases where SIDEWALK was deployed instead of
CobaltStrike were for high-value targets.
These campaigns targeted a variety of sectors including
financial services, retail, telecommunications, manufacturing,
and aviation.

35 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Confluence vulnerability

In prior years, Red Kelpie has mass-exploited vulnerabilities
in public facing infrastructure to gain initial access, a tactic
that we also noted in 2021. In particular, we observed Red
Kelpie exploiting the Atlassian Confluence code execution
vulnerability CVE-2021-26084 to drop a batch script and DLL
used to load and execute Cobalt Strike.119 Red Kelpie has
previously been observed using exploits for vulnerabilities
in Citrix/Cisco software to deploy very similar batch scripts,
which are also known to load and execute Cobalt Strike.120

Active, despite indictments

In September 2020, the US Justice Department indicted
seven individuals based in Asia alleging that these
individuals were computer hackers, and that the intrusions
they conducted were referred to in open source as APT41,
BARIUM, Winnti, and so on.121

Despite these indictments, Red Kelpie activity continued
throughout 2021. Perhaps the bigger cost to Red Kelpie due
to the indictment was the seizing of accounts, servers, and
domains being utilised by the threat actor, which forced it
to change some of its operational tempo. We have tracked
new sets of infrastructure being used by this threat actor
across late-2020/2021, yet have still observed overlaps with
older associated infrastructure attributed to that of APT41/
BARIUM. The indictments of several of the operators behind
the campaigns do not seem to have had any significant
overall impact on the threat actor’s operations.

36 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Incident response case study:

Red Dev 14’s FUNRUN

PwC responded to an intrusion into a think tank by a
China-based threat actor, which we identified as Red Dev
14.122 Using the ProxyLogon exploits, the threat actor
dropped a webshell onto an on-premises Exchange server.
Initially, the threat actor attempted some reconnaissance
via the webshell (mainly consisting of gathering system
information like usernames and running processes), and
ran commands to dump the memory of LSASS to obtain
credentials via living-off-the-land binaries. The threat actor
then utilised a variant of the backdoor called FUNRUN, which
it used to drop ProcDump to dump the LSASS memory, as
well as dropping Mimikatz to disk.
After successfully obtaining credentials, the threat actor
moved laterally in the network via SMB remote shares,
installing the FUNRUN backdoor to additional hosts. The
threat actor also ran commands to search for other webshells
on the Exchange server. This was likely done to test whether
the Exchange server had already been compromised (likely

by ProxyLogon), which would inform Red Dev 14 if another
threat actor was also present on the system. This has the
potential to affect how it would achieve its goals.
From an attribution standpoint, we had previously observed
the FUNRUN backdoor being used by the China-based
threat actor we track as Red Pegasus (aka APT9).123 However,
a large amount of time has passed between when Red
Pegasus was last observed using this backdoor (during 2014
and 2015), and the 2021 FUNRUN activity we observed.
Based on this consideration, as well as on the fact that the
loading mechanism was different for this backdoor compared
to Red Pegasus’ usage, and that there were no infrastructure
overlaps with Red Pegasus, we decided to track this activity
under the new name Red Dev 14.

Red Dev 14 compromised victims in multiple geographies as part of this campaign, primarily in agricultural sector.

37 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Call me, maybe: China-based threat actors
targeting telecommunications
Targeting of the telecommunications sector continues to be a
focus for multiple China-based threat actors. Organisations in
this sector hold a variety of high value information, including
data from a telecommunications provider on its customers
(which, depending on the provider, may be metadata around
connections to websites, or call logs). This kind of information
can then be exploited by threat actors for surveillance
purposes, or to gather traditional intelligence about the
activities of specific targets.
For example, as described above, we continued to see Red
Kelpie targeting the telecommunications sector,124 as well
as the shared tool ShadowPad being used to compromise
telecommunications providers.125 We supported an incident
response investigation to a telecommunications provider
in Southeast Asia, where we observed a variant of the
Evora backdoor used by the China-based threat actor Red
Salamander (aka LotusBlossom).126

Some things change, and
some things stay the same for
India-based threat actors
From our investigations into India-based threat actor
operations, we continue to see a narrow focus on countries
of strategic relevance to India, particularly on its nearneighbours, China and Pakistan. We observed almost all
India-based espionage threat actors that we track using lure
documents related to policy or political affairs of targeted
countries, or otherwise themed around military and defence
topics.

Orange Kala (Donot)

Orange Kala (aka Donot) maintained similar operational
tempo and targeting focus in 2021 as in the previous year,
with little variance in TTPs. In at least one case, the threat
actor used a lure document related to missile technology.127
This lure topic was not new for Orange Kala, as the content of
several other lure documents since at least November 2020
was taken from both news articles and journals focusing
heavily on missile defence technology. However, while most
of the previous lure documents on this topic related to the
United States, this campaign was the first instance where
PwC observed Orange Kala focusing on missile technology
within the Asia Pacific region. Both in this campaign, and
throughout the year, Orange Kala relied heavily on the

Case study: Red Menshen
targeting telecommunications
providers
Throughout 2021 we tracked and responded
to multiple intrusions attributed to a Chinabased threat actor that we have named
Red Menshen.128 This threat actor has been
observed targeting telecommunications
providers across the Middle East and
Asia, as well as entities in the government,
education, and logistics sectors using a
custom backdoor we refer to as BPFDoor.
This backdoor supports multiple protocols for
communicating with a C2 including TCP, UDP,
and ICMP allowing the threat actor a variety
of mechanisms to interact with the implant.
Our research has shown that this threat actor
uses a variety of tools in its post-exploitation
phase. This includes custom variants of the
shared tool Mangzamel (including Golang
variants), custom variants of Gh0st, and open
source tools like Mimikatz and Metasploit to
aid in its lateral movement across Windows
systems.129, 130 We also identified that the
threat actor sends commands to BPFDoor
victims via Virtual Private Servers (VPSs)
hosted at a well-known provider, and that
these VPSs, in turn, are administered via
compromised routers based in Taiwan, which
the threat actor uses as VPN tunnels.
Most Red Menshen activity that we observed
took place between Monday to Friday (with
none observed on the weekends), with most
communication taking place between 01:00
and 10:00 UTC.131 This pattern suggests a
consistent 8 to 9-hour activity window for
the threat actor, with realistic probability of it
aligning to local working hours.

38 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) tool WarzoneRAT. In one
campaign, the threat actor deployed WarzoneRAT through
a malicious DLL that would ultimately decode and execute
a long series of hardcoded command-line commands in
a batch script.132 Some lure documents involved in that
campaign, and uploaded to an online multi-antivirus scanner
from the UAE, were themed around new vessels in the Iranian
Navy, and some around multinational naval exercises hosted
by Pakistan, suggesting the threat actor’s likely interest in
military themes.

Sharing is caring

Over the year, we observed several crossovers in TTPs
between Orange Kala and other India-based threat actors
which we are still investigating, but which could be indicative
of a greater degree of interconnection among India-based
threat actors than had previously been considered. During
February 2021, we tracked a campaign133 involving a
malicious RTF file template with links to both Orange Kala
and Orange Dev 1 (aka CONFUCIUS) operations in 2020.134
Links were also identified as far back as a 2017 campaign
targeting Pakistan and known as Operation Shaheen135 The
2021 activity centred on military and defence themes, with
lure documents making reference to defence proposals, and,
in one case, to the Royal Thai Navy. Orange Kala and Orange
Dev 1 have both been known to target the defence and
government sectors in the past. The 2021 campaign used
different techniques from the similar activity reported in
2020136, adding an extra layer into the attack chain, with the
initial RTF documents downloading a second RTF on the
victim machine, and using that second RTF as a downloader
for a malicious DLL.
In June 2021, we observed a campaign by Orange Athos
(aka Patchwork) involving VBA scripts that we had previously
observed being used by Orange Kala as early as 2019.137
The VBA macros were strikingly similar in the 2019 and
2021 activity, down to unique variable names; this suggests
with realistic probability that they were not the product of a
macro builder, but bespoke macros created by a threat actor
and repurposed by another. While the malicious document
was modelled after a Pakistani individual’s biography taken
from Scribd.com, the threat actor altered the original text to
claim that the individual’s father used to work for the Space
and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO),

the national space agency of Pakistan. The document was
used to deliver the BADNEWS backdoor, a long-standing
staple in Orange Athos’ arsenal, to victims. Other open
source reports138, 139 earlier in the year had discussed further
malicious lure documents themed around SUPARCO; these
delivered WarzoneRAT to targets and were attributed to Indiabased threat actor Orange Dev 1.
These campaigns display at least some modicum of shared
tooling, or of cross-adaptation of simple tools, between
India-based threat actors. However, we note we have only
observed this at the level of initial access vectors, with Indiabased threat actors still largely differing in their choice of
later-stage backdoors.

Orange Athos (Patchwork)

Orange Athos (aka Patchwork) continued to make heavy
use of the BADNEWS backdoor (also known as BozokRAT)
throughout different campaigns in 2021, with only minor
changes to the malware’s codebase since it was first reported
on in open source as far back as 2016.140
The threat actor maintained its previous focus141 on Chinese
and Pakistani targets. In a campaign we observed in April
2021, the threat actor used a lure document relating to
military cooperation between China and Pakistan.142 The
document was a malicious DOCX file exploiting CVE2017-0261, a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability pertaining
specifically to encapsulated postscript (EPS) images. This is a
technique that we had observed the threat actor consistently
rely on in several 2020 campaigns involving nearly identical
tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), each with a focus
on China-based targets.
Among separate intrusions, one143 featured a lure purporting
to be a form by the Federal Board of Revenue of Pakistan,
asking employees of Pakistani federal government
departments to input their personal details to be eligible
to receive a special tax relief package. When victims
opened the RTF, the same vulnerability mentioned above
(CVE-2017-0261) would lead to the installation of the
BADNEWS backdoor. With the continued exploitation of the
specific vulnerability, and use of tooling that has been well
documented in open source, it appears this is another threat
actor that will persist with tried and tested TTPs.

Orange Yali (BITTER)

Throughout 2021, we identified several websites purporting
to be legitimate Pakistani companies that we believe were
most likely set up and maintained by India-based threat actor
Orange Yali (aka BITTER) since 2020. The websites, which
typically have little to no content or placeholder text, were
used to stage payloads of the “rkftl” backdoor, sometimes
packaged as an MSI installer, as well as utilities, such as the
SSH and Telnet client PuTTY. Orange Yali also continued
to use the malware family known as ArtraDownloader,
and introduced the use of CHM (compiled HTML) files in a
campaign specifically targeting Chinese entities.144, 145 Several
reports also indicated that Orange Yali used at least two
different 0-day exploits146, 147 throughout 2021, both of which
were quite likely acquired from an exploit broker as opposed
to developed in-house by the threat actor.148 This indicates
that at least one India-based, espionage-motivated threat
actor has the resources to access the private 0-day market,
something which we had not previously observed from threat
actors active in the region.

Espionage doesn’t pay:
Pakistan-based threat
actor activity
Throughout 2021, Green Havildar (aka APT36, Transparent
Tribe, Gorgon Group) primarily continued operating in
line with its likely main objective of gathering intelligence
(including targeting of the military, government, and wider
public sector, particularly in India). This threat actor relies on
basic spear phishing for initial access, with lure documents
varying from individuals’ curriculum vitaes to conference
programmes, to several samples related to military and
defence.149
Green Havildar is known for its use of CrimsonRAT, which
it continued to operate through a builder model: the RAT
has a wide set of surveillance and exfiltration capabilities,

a consistent code obfuscation model, and the ability for
the threat actor to flexibly change the ports over which C2
activity is conducted. Between April and July 2021, Team
Cymru published reports exposing the setup of Green
Havildar’s C2 infrastructure, including the threat actor’s
management of it over RDP.150, 151
In 2021, we observed increased activity by Green Havildar’s
financially-motivated, cybercrime-focused operations
(reported in open source under the moniker Gorgon Group
aka Aggah, MasterMana). As in 2020, the majority of Gorgon
Group’s spam campaigns involved PowerPoint document
lures, and OneDrive links, delivering commodity RATs such as
AgentTesla, Remcos, and Quasar. We additionally observed
the use of two separate common injectors by the threat actor
RunPE and HCrypt.
While Gorgon Group is also known to host multistage
malicious scripts on public paste sites such as Pastebin
and Blogspot, we also tracked a series of campaigns using
accounts on The Internet Archive for similar purposes. In
August 2021, it was reported152 that Gorgon Group was
using compromised websites to stage next-stage malicious
payloads and delivering Warzone RAT in place of paste sites,
in an effort to avoid detection and takedown of its staged
capabilities.153
While Green Havildar’s intelligence gathering operations
focus primarily on India as well as occasionally on
neighboring countries like Afghanistan154, Gorgon Group’s
activity has an international reach not necessarily limited to
political considerations. For example, from April 2021 we
tracked a Gorgon Group campaign targeting organisations
in the Netherlands and South Korea155, including in the
manufacturing sector (a frequent target of this threat actor).
In contrast to Green Havildar, Gorgon Group is relatively
indiscriminate in its targeting, and we have not observed it
deploying any custom capabilities.

(Not) all is quiet on the
Scarlet front: Vietnam-based
threat actor activity
Following Facebook’s public attribution in December 2020 of
Scarlet Ioke (aka Ocean Lotus, APT32) to CyberOne Group, a
Vietnam-based IT company, we observed a drastic reduction
in the threat actor’s operational tempo – at least with regards
to known, ongoing campaigns. On the other hand, Chinese
cybersecurity firms continued observing Scarlet Ioke
targeting China over the past year, which is consistent with

the threat actor’s long-standing targeting focus. For example,
Sangfor156 reported in March on Scarlet Ioke activity using
a loader commonly referred to as “DgBase.dll”. The Linux
RotaJakiro157 backdoor, which is also equipped with botnet
functionality, was also attributed in open source to Scarlet
Ioke, based on close code overlaps between RotaJakiro and
the OceanLotus backdoor.
Between late 2020 and September 2021, we observed a
campaign158 involving DLL loaders for Cobalt Strike and
MetaSploit which used several layers of Shikata Ga Nai
encoding to avoid detection. In some cases, the Cobalt Strike
payloads used the Glitch web service to conduct C2 activity.

In at least one case, the DLL was sideloaded by a legitimate
Kingsoft binary, a software predominately used in Mandarin
Chinese-speaking countries. Furthermore, many of the Cobalt
Strike samples that we identified were masquerading as
Tencent’s QQ service or as the Chinese search engine Sogou,
a consistent tactic for Scarlet Ioke. This evidence suggests
with realistic probability that the binaries were meant to target
Chinese-speaking victims. Based on the TTPs and targeting
that we observed in this campaign, we assess it is a realistic
probability that it was conducted by Scarlet Ioke. Factors
contradicting this assessment include the lack of direct links
to previous Scarlet Ioke activity, as well as the use of typical
penetration testing tools that could also be part of a domestic
red team exercise.
Ultimately, threat actors respond differently to disclosure and
attribution. Some, like Red Kelpie and Yellow Garuda, might
continue operations with no alteration to their TTPs, while
others may change tools and techniques or even undergo
radical restructuring. Based on the observations
we assess it unlikely that Scarlet Ioke has ceased
operations. Rather, we assess it is likely that the threat
actor is retooling and reorganizing, with plans to ramp
up activity in new campaigns.

Threat actors respond differently to public
disclosure of their activity. Some, like Red
Kelpie and Yellow Garuda, continue operations
with little to no changes to their TTPs, while
others (possibly including Scarlet Ioke) may
change tools and techniques, or even undergo
radical restructuring.”

Middle East

Iran-based threat activity
The changing face of sabotage operations
Iran-based threat actors have a long history of conducting
sabotage attacks meant to destroy and disrupt victim
organisations. Such attacks put the threat actors squarely
under the spotlight, typically leading to attribution and
scrutiny of their operations by the private and public sectors
alike. In an attempt to mitigate unwanted attention, Iranbased threat actors often blame or pose as hacktivist
collectives, a tactic that continues to be adopted by
suspected Iran-based threat actors such as White Dev 95
(aka Moses Staff).159

First emerging in late 2020 and rising to prominence in 2021,
we observed a theme of Iran-based threat actors amplifying
false motivation tactics, including Yellow Dev 15’s Pay2Key
and N3tw0rm activity leveraging ransomware for sabotage
rather than financial gain.160 When used in conjunction with
hacktivist behaviours, this can work to sow confusion about a
threat actor’s true nature and intentions.
Iran-based threat actors such as Yellow Dev 15 and Yellow
Dev 21 have also at times masqueraded as cyber criminals
rather than hacktivists in their sabotage campaigns, where
they also pretended to extort their victims.161 On one
occasion, Yellow Dev 21 threatened to sell a victim’s data to
third parties if a payment was not made.162

PwC observed the following suspected Iran-based threat actors, with varying levels of confidence, leverage ransomware in
their campaigns:

TarnishedGauntlet, DEV-0146)

43 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Case study: N3tw0rm
In late April 2021, a ransomware variant named N3tw0rm emerged targeting Israeli victims in the retail,
logistics, NGO, and construction sectors. Technical analysis subsequently uncovered similarities between
N3tw0rm and another ransomware variant named Pay2Key, is controlled by Yellow Dev 15, due to its lack of
follow-through on providing decryption keys (as of December 2021, the bitcoin wallet listed on the N3tw0rm
ransom note remained empty, which means no victim paid the ransom). The motivations behind the attacks
appear to align with sabotage rather than financial.166 As of December 2021, the bitcoin wallet listed on the
N3tw0rm ransom note remained empty, which means no victim paid the ransom.

Case study: Moses Staff
Starting in September 2021, a threat actor calling itself “Moses Staff’’ started a destructive “lock and leak”
campaign against Israeli organisations. We track the threat actor behind this campaign as White Dev 95. The
majority of the campaign’s victims observed in late 2021 were Israeli organisations whose business footprints
do not align to the threat actor’s mission statement exposing various crimes allegedly committed by the Israeli
Government. They also span a diverse range of sectors: legal, logistics, retail, utilities, professional services,
transport, construction, manufacturing, and financial services. This victimology suggests that targets were
likely chosen somewhat opportunistically, with the focus solely on Israel as a target rather than on exposing
any alleged wrongdoing.
White Dev 95 also displayed multiple similarities with a number of Israel-focused campaigns attributed to
Iran-based threat actors that have taken place across 2021, and which specifically sought public attention in
an attempt to build momentum towards their activities. To that effect, White Dev 95 operates multiple digital
platforms to leak victim data, as well as directly engaging with them over Twitter. One of the key differentiators
between the “Moses Staff’’ campaign and similar operations by Iran-based threat actors, is that White Dev
95 skips the extortion phase of its attacks, preferring instead to leak stolen data without warning. This likely
contributes to the confusion caused to victims, maximising the destructive element of the campaign.

44 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

You can’t teach an old threat actor new TTPs
The majority of Iran-based threat actors that we track
emerged with new flavours of tooling this past year, while also
continuing to rely on tried and tested techniques. Iran-based
threat actors are often known for their use of open source
tooling, particularly offensive security tools, as well as for
their social engineering campaigns.

Open source tools

Yellow Nix (aka Static Kitten, MERCURY, MuddyWater)
leveraged commercial remote administration tools
consistently throughout 2021, including ConnectWise
Control (aka ScreenConnect) and Remote Utilities, in order
to gain initial access to victims.167 We also saw Yellow
Nix intermittently using macro-enabled Microsoft Office
documents, including using them as a delivery mechanism for
ConnectWise Control.168
Both Yellow Dev 24169 and Yellow Dev 15170 have used the
open-source FRP tool, which allows a system to provide
network access to threat actor-controlled systems located
outside of the victim network. Similarly, Yellow Orc (aka
APT 33, Refined Kitten, Stonedrill) is well known for its use
of PoshC2, an open source C2 framework used for postexploitation and lateral movement. In 2021, we observed
new Yellow Orc activity, which incorporated a similar publicly
available C2 framework.171

Social engineering

A common denominator among many Iran-based threat
actors is to use job or recruitment themed phishing
lures, while relying on social media platforms to directly
communicate and build trust with targets. In several fringe
cases, phishing and social engineering techniques bypassed
multi-factor authentication (MFA); however, from our
observations, MFA remains highly effective in thwarting
the majority of attacks.172
Yellow Maero (aka APT34, OilRig, COBALT GYPSY) has
a long history of social engineering; in January 2021, we
observed it using a recruitment brochure branded as a
legitimate US-based IT services provider and advertising a
range of different IT, business, and engineering roles available
in the Middle East.173 The lure document is likely legitimate,
though it was maliciously repurposed by the threat actor.
In July, the threat actor we track as Yellow Orc (aka APT33,
Elfin) conducted a campaign involving job lures and a fake
career finder website for positions primarily in the Middle
East, with a focus on the following sectors: Oil & Gas,
Chemicals, Energy, Life Sciences, Manufacturing, Mining,
Infrastructure, and Government.174 Open directory contents
also show the threat actor likely began the year focusing
on US targeting via malicious HTA files, and simultaneously
conducted an operation leveraging a piece of malware that
masqueraded as a COVID-19 tracker from the World Health
Organization (WHO).175 The open directory evidenced that
Yellow Orc likely also used images of a female individual to
socially engineer its targets.176 The images bear resemblance
to open source reporting on the “Marcella Flores” persona
operated by the threat actor we track as Yellow Liderc.177
Yellow Orc has been using job themed social engineering
tactics since at least 2017.

Yellow Liderc (aka Tortoiseshell, TA456)178 and a closely related threat actor we track as Yellow Dev 13
continued throughout 2021 to use LinkedIn and Facebook for social engineering, maintaining a network of fake
recruitment companies and personas.179, 180 Both Microsoft and Meta documented Yellow Liderc’s persistent
yet patient process of using social media, often spanning multiple months between the initial connection with
the target to the delivery of malicious content.181, 182

45 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Broadening horizons
Yellow Nix

Yellow Nix continued to broaden its horizons beyond the
geographic regions neighbouring Iran. Following a busy year
in 2020, when it targeted Europe in multiple campaigns, in
September 2021 we saw the threat actor shifting towards
Southeast Asia. Its targeting of government, aviation, and
telecommunications sectors in Malaysia, in particular,
followed economic cooperation talks held between Iranian
and Malaysian officials.183 This is typically the case with
Yellow Nix, with its activity often closely mirroring Iran’s
political and trade investments. Yellow Nix also appeared to
direct increased levels of interest towards the aviation sector.

Figure 24: Yellow Nix targeted geographies and sectors

Source: PwC

In September 2020, the United States sanctioned individuals
associated with Yellow Mimas, a threat actor notorious for
targeting global aviation and telecommunications sectors
in order to monitor traveller movements. Since then, PwC
analysts have not observed Yellow Mimas activity, and
the threat actor has also been notably absent in open
source threat reporting. It remains unclear if Yellow Mimas
has entered a period of inactivity, but Yellow Nix’s uptick
in targeting aviation organisations demonstrates that its
sponsor’s requirement to obtain intelligence from this sector
is likely being fulfilled, although the extent which Yellow Nix
achieves this remains unclear. Yellow Nix’s recent victimology
also mirrors that of Yellow Mimas, and indicates that Yellow
Nix may be engaged in conducting surveillance on individuals
of interest.184

46 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Yellow Dev 9

First reported on by open sources in 2019, espionagemotivated Yellow Dev 9 (aka Lyceum, Siamese Kitten) shares
similarities in its victimology, infrastructure, and tooling with
another Iran-based threat actor we track as Yellow Maero.
Yellow Dev 9 continued to be active in 2021 targeting
African telecommunication and aviation sectors, socially
engineering targets over LinkedIn, and hosting its recruitment
themed malware on domains masquerading as information
technology companies.185 Despite multiple security
researchers releasing public reports on Yellow Dev 9, the
threat actor continued to develop new variants of malware,
termed “Milan” and “Shark” backdoors, which use HTTP and
DNS network connectivity. Yellow Dev 9’s infrastructure has a
specific pattern, with the threat actor consistently registering
command and control (C2) domains with DNS-, “update”,
and CDN-themed names during 2021.186 Yellow Dev 9 is
known to reuse its historic infrastructure from its earlier
campaigns.187

Yellow Garuda

One of the most active and widely reported threat actors
this past year was Yellow Garuda (aka Charming Kitten,
PHOSPHORUS, ITG18). This threat actor is highly capable
and persistent, increasing its operational tempo in 2021 while
maintaining a sprawling network of phishing infrastructure.
Yellow Garuda’s campaigns range from simple credential
phishing188 to compromising legitimate websites,189 deploying
mobile malware,190 using Telegram bots to fingerprint victim
devices,191 and doubling-down on social engineering efforts.
These operations translate into widespread targeting of
victims around the globe and across multiple sectors.
Victimology throughout 2021 included internal target sets
within Iran, as well as neighboring countries throughout the
Middle East, and typical targets in both the US and Europe.

Yellow Dev 19

An Iran-based threat actor, which PwC tracks as Yellow
Dev 19, was observed targeting websites related to the
2020 United States presidential election, in what the US
government assesses was an attempt to influence and
interfere with the election.192 We assessed in May 2021 that
Yellow Dev 19 was likely closely associated with the Iranian
education sector, specifically in the form of a student or
faculty member, which a November 2021 US indictment
supports with the naming of two individuals aged 23-26193.
We also identified that Yellow Dev 19 likely is interested in
targeting Saudi Arabian government entities.194

According to the US government indictment, the alleged
company responsible for leading the attempted campaign
is Emennet Pasargad, a company acting in support
of the Iranian government.195 PwC analysts have also
observed overlaps between this company, together with
its sanctioned board members, and Yellow Liderc.196 PwC
assesses that Emennet Pasargad and/or its personnel is
likely involved in other operations, such as ransomware for
sabotage purposes, and is closely aligned with the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Yellow Dev 24

Spanning from at least April to November 2021, PwC
observed Yellow Dev 24 (aka Nemesis Kitten, a part of
PHOSPHORUS) mass-scanning internet facing appliances,
including Fortinet devices and Microsoft Exchange servers.197
In some cases, Yellow Dev 24 subsequently deployed
ransomware via BitLocker, while relying on open source
tooling and living-off-the-land techniques. Yellow Dev 24 is
one of several Iran-based threat actors who are adopting
ransomware for sabotage purposes, while simultaneously
capable of conducting espionage activity. Yellow Dev 24 is
also opportunistic in its targeting selection, which makes this
threat actor relevant to a global audience.198
Victims in this campaign were geographically diverse, and
included organisations in the US, Australia, the UAE, and
South Africa,199 as the threat actor reportedly compromised
nearly 1,000 devices in just over six months.200 Slightly
more targeted (though still opportunistic) activity occurred
via password spraying US and Israeli defence technology
companies, Arabian Gulf ports of entry, and global maritime
transportation companies with business presence in the
Middle East.201

47 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Threat activity across the
Middle East
Teal Dev 2

Turkey-based threat actor Teal Dev 2 (aka StrongPity)
continued to deploy its well-known backdoor StrongPity
throughout 2021 although, from our observations, this activity
slowed in the second half of the year. New Teal Dev 2 TTPs
were brought to light, with open source reporting showing
infrastructure links between StrongPity and Android malware,
not previously known to be part of the threat actor’s toolset,
but which has likely been used since at least 2019.202 Based
on these observations, we assess that Teal Dev 2’s apparent
sparing use of specific tools and techniques has likely let
them go undetected for several years, and is likely indicative
of highly targeted campaigns.

Grey Karkadann

Grey Karkadann (aka Arid Viper, APT-C-23, and part of the
Gaza Cybergang) has continued using tried and tested
techniques to target entities in the Middle East region,
with a strong focus on Palestinian politics and PalestineIsrael relations. Over the course of 2021, this included the
continued use of its Windows malware Micropsia,203 which
is typically accompanied by decoy documents aligning
with its main targeting themes. We also observed ongoing

development of its mobile malware, which is distributed
via third party app stores or threat actor-controlled sites.
Open source reporting notes that Grey Karkadann’s arsenal
now includes iOS malware in addition to its known Android
implants.204 The threat actor’s mobile malware contains
extensive surveillance and stealth functionality, often
masquerading as legitimate applications.205

White Dev 21

In May 2021, we observed a cluster of activity focused on
Arabic speakers with an interest in Middle East affairs.206
The activity spanned back to at least 2019, and involved
the use of macro-enabled documents with content covering
a broad range of news and themes related to Palestine,
Lebanon, and Iraq. This indicates that the threat actor has
likely targeted multiple separate victims during this campaign.
Open source reporting has linked this activity to a threat actor
known as WIRTE, and highlighted the targeting of a number
of high profile organisations in sectors including government
and diplomatic entities, law firms, and financial institutions
making the threat actor of concern to a wide variety of
sectors.207 From our observations, WIRTE shares historic
infrastructure overlaps with White Dev 21, a threat actor
we observed in 2019 using election and diplomatic-relation
themed lures related to Egyptian and Palestinian politics,
and which we assess to likely be an offshoot of the Gaza
Cybergang. 208, 209

48 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Europe and former
Soviet Union

Threat actors based in Russia continued their cyber
operations in 2021, seeking to access confidential or
sensitive information. This has included the targeting of
government ministries across Europe, and Russia’s near
abroad. We saw the threat actor Blue Athena (aka Sofacy)
take particular interest in the mining and natural resources
sector in Central Asia.
We also continued to see the consistent targeting of entities
in Ukraine by the Russia-based threat actor Blue Otso.
We tracked Blue Otso activity targeting entities in eastern
Ukraine, in the lead-up to the Ukrainian Security Service
(SBU) eventually unmasking several alleged Blue Otso
operators in November 2021.
Additionally, beyond Russia-based threat actors, our
research also included tracking other malicious activity. White
Tur is one example of an as-yet unattributed threat actor
whose interest has focused on very specific sectors and
geographies. Elsewhere, Georgia-based threat actor Rose
Matsil has been observed in association with the targeting of
medical organisations in Russia in 2021.

Blue Dev 5 - A ‘noble’ phisher
The Russia-based threat actor Blue Dev 5 (aka NOBELIUM210,
NobleBaron) was one of the most prolific and technicallysophisticated threat actors we tracked in 2021. Blue Dev
5 demonstrated careful tradecraft and novel techniques,
including compromising Microsoft cloud environments and
exploiting trust relationships between organisations.
Blue Dev 5 successfully compromised several cloud resellers
and MSPs, leveraging cloud trust relationships held by these
organisations with their customers to compromise customer
cloud environments, and exploit the access provided to
MSPs in order to pivot into their clients’ networks. Once
Blue Dev 5 gains access to victim organisations, it aims to
gain long-term, stealthy, persistent access to Azure AD and
Microsoft 365 instances, including privileged accounts and

sensitive data. Blue Dev 5 has demonstrated high levels
of operational security, and has taken measures to evade
detections and make it harder for victim organisations
to investigate suspicious activity (for example, logging
into compromised accounts at victim organisations from
residential IP addresses).
We are not currently able to definitively link Blue Dev 5 with
the threat actor behind the SolarWinds supply chain attacks
that we track as Blue Nova211, 212. However, we noted a
significant overlap in techniques between the two, including
in the techniques used to perform sophisticated identitybased attacks against Microsoft cloud environments. We
also noted that both Blue Dev 5 and Blue Nova213 leverage
third-party trust relationships to gain access to organisations’
IT environments.
Organisations concerned about the threat of Blue Dev 5
should take steps to:
•	Implement a robust privileged access strategy that
includes using secure administration practices and
stringent restrictions around the use of privileged access;
•	Monitor Azure AD and Microsoft 365 logs for techniques
used to compromise and abuse privileged accounts,
persistence techniques, and for rare global events; and,
•	Regularly audit cloud (Azure AD, Microsoft 365 and Azure)
configurations and trust relationships.
Blue Dev 5 has also been observed using other well known
techniques to gain access to organisations’ environments,
including password spraying and using compromised
credentials.

49 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Blue Dev 5 drew significant attention in May 2021, when it conducted a phishing campaign masquerading as USAID,
in order to distribute Cobalt Strike Beacon malware packed with a custom loader. In this instance, we derived the following
view of this activity:

There is evidence that the first-stage HTML attachments
were opened by individuals working at multiple embassies
across Europe,214 providing insight into the broader targeting
conducted by this threat actor. Some payloads used by Blue
Dev 5 appear to have been more targeted: one seen in March
2021215 checked for environment variables which relate to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of an Eastern European country;
another impersonated an update for a Ukrainian government
document management system.216

By tracking Blue Dev 5’s infrastructure over time, we also
observed its TTPs grow more complex. For example, in
a HTML lure which was likely created in November 2021,
the threat actor had added several more stages between
the initial HTML lure and the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload
ultimately delivered to targets. In this case, as well as one
other we identified, the lure document purported to notify the
victim that an embassy was closed due to COVID-19.
We assess that it is highly likely that Blue Dev 5 will
continue to remain active throughout the coming year,
and that its TTPs will continue to evolve over time to better
evade detection.

In January 2021, PwC observed a phishing domain
targeting the Serbian military. 217 Soon after, we identified
additional related infrastructure that showed targeting of
Serbian and Republika Srpska government and defence
organisations ongoing since at least 2017, which we are
tracking in association with a threat actor we call White Tur.
Republika Srpska is one of the two federal entities within
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This activity has taken place against a
complex strategic backdrop as the wider Balkans region has
a diverse, yet fractious, history. The targeting of both Serbia
and Republika Srpska is of particular interest as, in recent
months, there have been increasingly strong calls by some
stakeholders for Republika Srpska to gain further autonomy,
or indeed outright secession.218
The additional infrastructure revealed previous activity that
the Ministry of Interior for Republika Srpska disclosed in
April 2020219: a spear phishing campaign impersonating the
prime minister of Republika Srpska, which led to a malicious
HTA file executing PowerShell code from a C2 domain which
we identified as connected to the Serbian military phishing
domain.

Continued tracking of related infrastructure over the year
identified targeting of Serbian research and development
organisations closely aligned to military and defence.220
In September 2021, White Tur performed strategic web
compromise on a website to host weaponised documents
and archives with Republika Srpska and defence themes221;
previous to this, weaponised White Tur files had been hosted
on dedicated threat actor-registered infrastructure.
In terms of capabilities, we observed White Tur using macroweaponised documents leading to a JScript backdoor.
Alternatively, White Tur deployed a Windows backdoor,
packaged in a weaponised archive containing the open
source project OpenHardwareMonitor, that used COM
bitstransfer objects to send information back to the C2.
Overall, we assess that White Tur is likely an espionagemotivated threat actor, and that it is likely to be aligned to a
nation state. Based on regional tensions, there are a number
of potential candidates for involvement in this activity, both
within the Balkans and farther afield. At present, we do not
have sufficient technical evidence to make a high confidence
assessment as to the potential backers of White Tur. We do,
however, assess that it is likely that the Balkans will remain a
region of interest for threat actors of a variety of origins and
motivations, White Tur among them. We explore White Tur
further in our blog.

Head in the clouds: Blue Odin
Blue Odin (aka CloudAtlas) is a threat actor known for
its targeting of a variety of organisations across Russia
and Russia-annexed regions of Ukraine using malicious
documents, and for closely controlling the payloads
these documents deliver in order to increase the difficulty
researchers face in tracking it.
In 2021, we observed several new facets to Blue Odin’s
activity ranging from operational security (OPSEC) errors to
new TTPs. In one instance, a malicious document used to
target the Ministry of Defence of a country in Central Europe
contained embedded links to an online translation service,
which appear to have been used to translate the source of
the lure contents from its original English to Ukrainian. This, in
turn, suggests that the operator who prepared the document
may speak Ukrainian as a first language.
Another observation was Blue Odin’s use of Responder
in early 2021. Responder is an open source tool used to
conduct SMB Forced Authentication attacks. In this type of
attack, the victim system attempts to authenticate to a threat
actor-controlled server using NTLM, enabling the threat actor
to capture challenge hashes. These may later be bruteforced offline in order to recover the victim’s password. The
malicious document in question likely targeted individuals
associated with foreign affairs and diplomatic entities, and
contained UNC paths to images on threat actor-controlled

servers which resulted in the forced authentication attack
described above. Curiously, one of the IP addresses
embedded in the document was likely a typo; the specified
IP did not appear to be hosting a Responder server, but
rather an IP address with a single character difference. This
represents a departure from previous techniques used in the
threat actor’s malicious documents, which generally used
remote template links. In other respects Blue Odin’s activity
remained very similar to that which has been observed
previously: such as a malicious document observed in
December 2021222 that fetched a remote template containing
an Equation Editor exploit, which downloads and executes
an HTA, and in turn deploys a variant of VBShower. This
chain is very similar to the exploit chain first documented by
Kaspersky in 2019.223
From the activity we observed, we assess that there is a
realistic probability that Blue Odin’s targeting aligns with
Ukrainian, rather than Russian, strategic priorities. For
example, Blue Odin activity within Ukraine’s borders seems
to focus primarily on the self-proclaimed separatist regions in
Eastern Ukraine, and on Crimea. We also observed Blue Odin
targeting Russian organisations, including the energy and
government sectors.224

53 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Blue Otso’s rollercoaster
Blue Otso (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) has experienced
both substantial successes and major setbacks in 2021, from
wide-ranging compromises of sensitive systems, to exposure
by the Security Service of Ukraine.
In February, the Ukrainian National Coordination Center for
Cybersecurity reported that Blue Otso had compromised
Ukrainian government document management systems
known as SEI EB225 and ASKOD226. While the initial indicators
of compromise were sparse, we identified a set of files
which were likely uploaded to an online multi-antivirus
scanner by an individual or individuals involved with incident
response related to a single ASKOD server.227 These files
included a variety of Blue Otso malware tools including
downloader scripts, exfiltration tools, a VNC client, and a
script used to add remote template references to Microsoft
Word documents, which aligns with assessments made by
the NCCC. These archives also included file modification
timestamps, which we assessed are likely to be accurate
to the times of deployment or modification on the victim
machine. These timestamps suggest that the threat actor
likely had access to the victim since at least 5th February
2021, several weeks before the incident was disclosed.
Blue Otso operations also faced notable disruptions in 2021.
The first example of interest was made public by the Security
Service of Ukraine in April, when they disclosed the arrest

of someone in relation to an individual sending messages to
the personal numbers of SBU employees.228 These messages
contained a link to a website that we later identified as
murders-dkr[.]ru, which contained a link to an archive file
purportedly containing lists of SBU officers who had bounties
placed on them by one of the separatist entities. This was
a first indicator available in open source that Blue Otso,
previously thought to be a Russia-based threat actor, may
well be supported by activities from non-occupied regions
within the borders of Ukraine.
This was later expanded upon in November 2021, when
the SBU disclosed the identities of a number of Blue
Otso operators, and alleged that the threat actor’s activity
is tied to an FSB unit based in Crimea.229, 230 This unit is
reportedly subordinate to the FSB’s 18th Centre, otherwise
known as the Centre for Information Security, a unit which
has previously been linked to data breaches by the US
Justice Department. Reportedly231 the SBU first suggested
Centre 18 involvement in 2015, at which time they also
suggested the involvement of FSB Centre 16, better known
for its association with Blue Python (aka Turla, Snake). Our
analysis232 noted that this announcement came amid reports
of a Russian military buildup close to the shared Ukrainian/
Russian border following large-scale military drills, prior to the
war breaking out in Ukraine.
More recent analysis suggests that Blue Otso is undeterred
by this disclosure; we assess that it is highly likely this threat
actor will remain active in 2022 and onwards.

New Threat
Actors Spotlight
In this section, we spotlight specific
cyber threat actors that we discovered
in 2021. This does not mean that the
threat actors were not previously
active. However, as we continuously
expand our tracking and identify new
threat actors based on our visibility
and collection, we think it valuable to
give coverage in this report to lesserknown threat actors, and ones that
we are still in the process of fully
understanding. The threat actors we
describe below have been included
because they displayed interesting
activity whether in their capabilities,
targeting, links to other threat actors,
or in the kind of operations they
perform.

55 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Red Dev 17

Blue Dev 6

In 2021, we started tracking a series of intrusions under the
moniker of Red Dev 17 that we assess were highly likely
conducted by a China-based threat actor. Our analysis
suggests Red Dev 17 has been active since at least 2017.

In October 2021, we observed several weaponised
documents which used Cloudflare workers as a C2 channel.
We assess that this activity was likely conducted by Blue
Dev 6 (aka ReconHellCat), a threat actor first reported on
by QuoIntelligence in August 2020.233 The weaponised
documents used remote templates and macros to execute
a payload downloaded from a Cloudflare worker C2.
The payload, which was heavily obfuscated, had several
similarities to BlackSoul malware (also known as BlackWater),
including code used to iterate through browser folders and
authenticate during C2 communication. The campaigns
we analysed targeted a range of sectors including energy,
defence, and government, as well as an international
humanitarian organisation.

Red Dev 17’s observed targets are mainly in India, and
include the Indian military, a multinational India-based
technology company, and a state energy company. We
assess that it is highly probable that the threat actor behind
intrusions associated with Red Dev 17 is also responsible
for the campaign known in open source as Operation
NightScout.
Red Dev 17 is a user of the 8.t document weaponisation
framework (also known as RoyalRoad), and abuses benign
utilities such as Logitech or Windows Defender binaries to
sideload and execute Chinoxy or PoisonIvy variants on victim
systems.
We identified capability and infrastructure links between
Red Dev 17 and the threat actor we call Red Hariasa (aka
FunnyDream APT), as well as infrastructure overlaps with
Red Wendigo (aka Icefog, RedFoxtrot), and with ShadowPad
C2 servers. At this time, we do not have sufficient evidence
to directly link Red Dev 17 to any of these threat actors.
However, we assess with realistic probability that Red Dev
17 operates within a cluster of threat actors that share tools
and infrastructure, as well as a strong targeting focus on
Southeast Asia and Central Asia.

Yellow Dev 23
We tracked a new cluster of activity focusing on both the
telecommunication and IT sectors as Yellow Dev 23 (aka
MalKamak, DEV-0270). Open sources reported on this threat
actor in late 2021 and described a campaign that focused
heavily on Israel, specifically its IT and telecommunication
sectors.234, 235 In addition to the open source reporting, we
observed the threat actor typosquatting domains between
February and July that spoofed Facebook and Office365
logins. Several of the malware samples attributed in open
source to this threat actor overlap with another Iran-based
threat actor we track as Yellow Liderc, which is known for
targeting the IT sector in the Middle East.236

56 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Incident response case study:

White Dev 89 calling

In 2021, we supported an incident response investigation
at a health organisation involving a threat actor we named
White Dev 89. This threat actor was observed performing
opportunistic targeting, likely using malvertising campaigns,
to deliver trojanised applications such as Zoom, AnyDesk,
and Windscribe to its victims. These would install the
respective legitimate applications, but at the same time drop
and execute a malicious PowerShell script (likely a modified
version of a PowerShellEmpire agent). This access allowed
the threat actor to perform basic reconnaissance on the
infected system. 237

Once White Dev 89 profiled a compromised machine, we
observed it dropping an additional PowerShell script to
deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon. This kicked off further activity
- including laterally moving via SMB to other systems on the
network. Other lateral movement techniques that White Dev
89 used included compromising high-privilege accounts,
running tools such as ADFind and BloodHound to map out
the targeted network, and using 7-ZIP and SubInAcl during
post-exploitation.

While the ultimate objectives of this threat actor are not clear, we found connections to other known campaigns. In
particular, we found overlaps with infrastructure previously used in QakBot campaigns, leading us to hypothesise that
either White Dev 89 is the same threat actor behind QakBot, or that it has previously used QakBot for initial access.

59 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Sectors
spotlight
In this section, we highlight key cyber
threats we observed in 2021 across a
selection of sectors.

60 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Telecommunications

Technology

2021 saw continued interest in the telecommunications
sector by espionage-motivated threat actors, likely for the
purposes of sensitive information collection as we have
observed in previous years.238 We estimate that more than
80 telecommunications companies have been compromised
by threat actors based in two countries.

Innovative technology is valuable to those looking to replicate
products and services, and intellectual property continues
to be sought after by threat actors. Technology companies
themselves may be targeted in supply chain and island
hopping attacks, particularly where they provide services
(including IT and cybersecurity) to customers. In 2021,
several airline companies (including members of the One Star
Alliance and other individual airlines in the Asia Pacific region)
were compromised through an initial breach of their shared
communication technology suppliers: SITA.246 Open source
analysis247 of this set of intrusions pointed to Red Kelpie as
the likely perpetrator. We also observed Red Djinn attempting
similar types of intrusions, with the threat actor targeting
overseas subsidiaries of Japanese companies likely to move
laterally and into the target’s main network.

As referenced earlier in this report, Red Menshen (formerly
Red Dev 18) deployed its bespoke BPFDoor malware to
multiple organisations in the Asia Pacific region, including
telecommunication providers based in several countries.239
PwC has observed other China-based threat actors targeting
the telecommunications sector, including Red Kelpie (aka
APT41) using its Motnug loader malware on a Pakistanbased provider.240 This same victim also appears to have
been targeted by Iran-based threat actor Yellow Mora241: in
the beginning of 2021, PwC analysed a campaign by Yellow
Mora (aka Greenbug) targeting the telecommunication sector
in South Asia.242 Our analysis showed that Yellow Mora likely
spent a prolonged period of time in the victim’s environment,
which aligns with public reporting on the way this threat
actor operates.243 Similar activity by Yellow Nix (aka Static
Kitten, MERCURY, MuddyWater), starting in January and
continuing throughout the year, targeted a large number of
telecommunication organisations in the Middle East, South
Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia.244 PwC assesses this
targeting is likely intended, at least in part, to surveil and track
individuals, which aligns with historical targeting of this sector
by closely aligned groups like Yellow Mimas.245
Nor did this sector escape targeting by ransomware
operations. Blue Lelantos’s new Macaw ransomware,
for example, was deployed against a US-based
telecommunications company, while White Janus and White
Apep – two of 2021’s most active ransomware operators –
also targeted multiple entities in this sector with Lockbit 2.0
and Darkside/BlackMatter ransomware, respectively. Overall,
several state telecommunications companies, as well as
high-profile private telecommunications providers, have fallen
victim to ransomware in the past year, including Ecuador’s
Corporacion Nacional de Telecomunicacione, Schepisi
Communications, and Spain’s MasMovil.

Threat actors were observed using technology company
names in SSL certificates associated with their malicious
infrastructure, as was identified with China-based threat
actors where ShadowPad C2 infrastructure was identified
masquerading as NVIDIA Corporation248. We also observed
samples of HyperBro malware signed with a certificate
belonging to a mobile app company. While there is evidence
to suggest HyperBro malware might be shared among
multiple China-based threat actors, its original user is Red
Phoenix (aka APT27, Emissary Panda, Lucky Mouse). We
observed Red Phoenix specifically continue targeting the
technology sector, and identified its compromise of at least
one US-based technology company.
Targeting against the technology sector was also initiated
by cyber criminals, with Acer being compromised by REvil
ransomware on two separate occasions: the second of which
saw the company receiving a ransom demand of US$50m,
one of the highest publicly known to date.249
Finally, Israeli technology companies also found themselves
receiving unwanted attention (purportedly a ‘hacktivist’
campaign) from White Dev 95, which we assess is very likely
a sabotage-motivated threat actor conducting an information
operation (IO) against Israel. Rather than using it for
extortion, the threat actor encrypts its victims’ networks and
immediately proceeds to leak any stolen data—activity that
bears the hallmarks of “lock and leak” operations.

61 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Financial services

Retail

Organisations in the financial services (FS) sector remained
a high-value target for cyber criminal threat actors. Across
over three months of listings on criminal marketplaces
RaidForums, XSS, and Exploit, the financial services entities
consistently ranked in the top three most-affected sectors.
They had a higher price relative to other impacted sectors, no
doubt due to FS listings being of greater interest to buyers in
terms of potential financial gains.

In 2021 ransomware operators continued to target the retail
sector, exploiting retailers’ need to maintain uninterrupted
operational uptime—thereby effectively pressuring their
victims to pay ransom, quickly. The rapid digitalisation
of the retail sector has led to ransomware actors’ ability
to cripple endpoint payment systems, leading to revenue
generation loss; further pressuring the organisation
to meet the ransom demand.

Established organised crime groups may specifically
target FS entities due to the expectation of large ransom
payments. For example, in early 2021 US insurance company
CNA was initially compromised when employees executed
a fake browser update. The organisation reportedly ended
up paying a ransom of US$40m. In May 2021, operators of
the Avaddon ransomware leaked data belonging to Asiabased divisions of the AXA Group (including customer PII),
and containing sensitive medical data; they also threatened
to attack AXA websites with a Distributed Denial-of-Service
(DDoS) attack if a ransom wasn’t paid. More recently, in late
November 2021 we observed a MirrorBlast campaign most
likely conducted by White Austaras, involving spam emails
that suggests the targeting of insurance companies based
in Canada and France, as well as of a number of Asset
and Wealth Management firms based in the US and
Hong Kong.250

Of the ransomware variants that have been observed
targeting the retail sector Conti, operated by threat actor
White Onibi, was the most active. This ransomware was
used to successfully target retailers from clothing outlets to
jewellery stores for either big ransom payouts or the theft
of unique, sensitive information,252, 253, 254 that White Onibi
auctioned in 2021.255

North Korea-based threat actors continued to pose a severe
threat to FS organisations across the board, from investment
and venture capital firms, to cryptocurrency exchanges
(or any other organisation handling cryptocurrency). A
February 2021 US Justice Department indictment of North
Korean nationals (believed to be part of Black Artemis)
states that the threat actor stole US$11.8m from a New
York financial institution using trojanized cryptocurrency
trading applications.251 Black Alicanto and Black Dev 2 have
been consistently targeting FS entities, often sending spear
phishing emails to targets as well as using lure documents
related to cryptocurrency, or pretending to be legitimate joint
venture pitches.

Other ransomware operators also targeted the retail sector.
As part of the supply-chain attack against Kaseya, Sodinokibi
ransomware infected the network of Visma Esscom, an IT
supplier. As a result of the Visma Esscom infection, over
500 individual Coop stores across Sweden had to close
after its payment systems were taken offline.256 In another
example, in December 2021 a ransomware incident affecting
retailer SPAR forced a reported 330 UK stores offline for – in
some cases – several days. These incidents are just a few
of the numerous ones afflicting the retail sector in 2021 and
threatening normal business operations.257, 258, 259, 260
Our analysis of listings on criminal marketplaces showed
that, while the majority of listings for retail companies
contained customer data, several (particularly on the
Exploit forum) promised buyers the ability to redirect card
payments on e-commerce websites. For brands that operate
in the e-commerce space it’s also worth remembering that
credit card skimming operations known as “Magecart” are
ongoing261, with the UK NCSC notifying over 4,000 small-tomedium retailers just ahead of the Black Friday sales period
that they were using compromised payment portals on their
Magento e-commerce platforms.

Incident response case study:

DarkSide - from initial
access to ransom
demand in four hours

In April 2021, PwC Incident Response teams from multiple
countries supported a global retail client that had fallen victim
to a ransomware attack perpetrated by DarkSide (tracked by
PwC as White Apep).

The threat actor then used the credentials collected from
these systems to create a Domain Administrator user,
generating and storing the account password in a LastPass
account belonging to the threat actor.

Analysis of the incident determined that the threat actor
initially leveraged a remote access tool known as LogMeIn
to gain access to the client’s IT estate. This tool was used
for legitimate purposes by one of the organisation’s IT
service providers to enable remote access for maintenance
of retail store workstations and supporting systems.
The initial intrusion used a functionality in the LogMeIn
software whereby users with valid credentials can remotely
access a system without any client employee needing to
interact with it.

Once the threat actor had compromised the Domain
Controller, it created a scheduled task and deployed it to
all computers in the client’s IT infrastructure, commanding
them to download and run the ransomware. The time
from the initial compromise to the ransomware being
deployed was roughly four hours. While the ransomware
operator demanded a US$12m ransom, the client managed
to establish manual business processes to keep the
organisation operational throughout incident response and
recovery efforts that spanned three weeks.

After compromising the retail store client in Country A,
the threat actor downloaded administration tools, using
them to perform internal reconnaissance on the client’s
network. Simultaneously, it elevated its privileges to a default
administrative account used throughout the domain through
LSASS memory dumping. Using the elevated privileges, the
threat actor pivoted to systems in Country B which were
end-of-life and not receiving updates.

Incident response case study:

ShinyHunters hunting
for treasure

In December 2021, PwC responded to an incident at an
India-based retail client that had initially observed a spike in
system resource utilisation across its cloud infrastructure,
and subsequently received a ransom email from the cyber
criminal threat actor we track as White Dev 100 (aka
ShinyHunters).
Analysis revealed that the threat actor initially gained access
to the network by using a compromised cloud access key
belonging to a former C-Suite member of the organisation.
The threat actor used the compromised credentials to gain
web console access to the client’s infrastructure. It was
unable to access any of the instances, and proceeded to run
reconnaissance commands to map the network.

The threat actor was able to create new instances and SSH
keys, eventually injecting them into the SSH-authorised keys
store. These actions, combined with the modifications to the
security group, allowed the threat actor to freely SSH into
the client environment. In addition, it accessed a number
of .ssh directories and copied available private SSH keys
to support its lateral movement. As the threat actor moved
through the network it identified systems of interest, including
testing and automation instances which it exploited for
further access. During this time the threat actor maintained
access to multiple terminal windows into the compromised
environment. From analysis of the activity it has not been
possible to determine if multiple operators were at work,
or a single individual.

65 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Manufacturing
For organisations in the manufacturing sector, any attack
which can impact the availability or integrity of infected
systems poses a critical risk to an organisation. These
attacks cause operational downtime, production and delivery
slowdowns resulting in lost revenue, as well as heavy
remediation costs which add to the difficulties of returning
to service. There are also knock-on issues such as delays
in production deadlines, breach in supplier contracts, and
reputational damage. Increasingly, the sector is experiencing
significant and targeted attacks, ranging from disgruntled
employees selling sensitive data to competitors to
ransomware attacks conducted by sophisticated organised
crime groups.
Operators of BlackMatter ransomware campaigns targeted
manufacturing organisations more than any other sector
between January and May 2021, in a series of sophisticated
attacks which netted over GBP 17.5 million in bitcoin
payments262. Lockbit 2.0 also exhibited a heavy focus on
the manufacturing organisations, with 21% of leak site data
between January and September 2021 belonging to victims
in the sector.
BEC attacks remain a substantial threat to all sectors,
including manufacturing. In 2021, PwC observed a campaign
most likely associated with Nigeria-based Bronze Dev 2 (aka
SilverTerrier) targeting organisations in the manufacturing
sector by sending spear phishing emails with a malicious
attachment posing as an urgent budget document, which
would deliver the commodity RAT AgentTesla.
Espionage remains prevalent within the manufacturing sector,
and it has historically attracted high levels of interest from
intelligence-gathering threat actors due to its associations
with defence and aerospace customers. More widely, the
technology investment taking place across the sector is likely
to result in a renewed surge of interest. In April 2021 Black
Artemis delivered weaponised lure documents, masquerading
as job applications, to manufacturing companies which
deployed malicious payloads onto the victim network263. The
impact of a successful espionage attack can result in the loss
of competitiveness in already tight international markets, as
well as regulatory penalties if personal data is accessed
in an intrusion.

66 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Incident response case study:

Multinational
manufacturing
corporation facing
LockBit

In March 2021, PwC responded to a ransomware incident
affecting a multinational corporation operating in the industrial
manufacturing sector, where a LockBit operator executed the
ransomware on servers and workstations across ten different
countries.

Throughout the following months, the threat actor
compromised a domain controller in the United States, then
moved to yet another server in the US, and in March 2021
leveraged a domain controller in Japan to distribute the
ransomware.

The incident analysis and investigation highlighted that
starting from Q4 2020 the threat actor began gathering
information about the client and preparing the attack.
After gaining initial access, the threat actor used the file
hosting service MEGA to download malware and conducted
web searches to understand the location and nature
of the infected systems. Subsequently, the threat actor
downloaded and executed network scanner tools (Softperfect
Network Scanner) and performed lateral movement using
compromised accounts and supported by popular tools
(including Mimikatz).

In the final moments of the attack, the threat actor interacted
with the client’s antimalware solution to ensure that the
ransomware would not be stopped, and ultimately distributed
and executed the ransomware. Although the attack caused
significant disruption to the victim organisation, there was no
clear evidence of data exfiltration.

67 PwC Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect

Conclusion
In 2021, the cyber threat landscape continued
to see an increase in threat actors of all motivation
and skill levels.
As in recent years, ransomware continues to be the most
pervasive and immediately impactful threat to organisations
of all sizes and sectors across the world, with ransomware
developers continuing to grow their affiliate schemes in
size, revenue, and capabilities. Supply chain attacks have
now become part of the “new normal” of the cyber threat
landscape, with cyber criminal threat actors incorporating
them in their playbooks for maximum impact.
At the same time, a different type of threat to a secure
digital society has been brought squarely into focus with the
prominence and impact of digital quartermasters: both those
traditionally aligned with state-sponsored operations, as well
as commercial private sector brokers providing a wide range
of clients with high-end offensive tooling and capabilities.

All these threats have culminated in a renewed focus on
0-day vulnerabilities - with several examples enabling both
targeted operations and mass-scale attacks, and growing
financial and strategic incentives pushing exploit research
and development activity.
We assess that the themes that have emerged or have
continued into 2021 – including ransomware and its
surrounding criminal ecosystem, the importance of
vulnerability and tools brokers, and the fallout of newly
discovered vulnerabilities impacting unprepared victims
– will continue into 2022. In the face of headline-grabbing
vulnerabilities and incidents, cybersecurity becomes ever
more present in the public eye, and it is even more important
than ever for defenders to continue collaborating, sharing,
and supporting organisations and society; focusing on
prevention and detection measures, as well as incident
mitigation and response plans that can stymy threat
actors effectively.
