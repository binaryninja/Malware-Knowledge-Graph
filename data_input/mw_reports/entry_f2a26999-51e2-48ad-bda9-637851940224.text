APT41: Indictments Put Chinese Espionage Group in the
Spotlight

The U.S. government has charged seven men in relation to hundreds of cyber attacks
against organizations in the U.S. and multiple other countries in Asia and Europe. Two of the
men, who were based in Malaysia, were arrested and their extradition to the U.S. has been
requested. The other five are based in China and remain at large.
The attacks were attributed to a China-linked organization dubbed APT41 and involved a
combination of intellectual property theft and financially motivated cyber crime. While some
of our peers monitor APT41 as a single operation, Symantec regards it as two distinct actors:
Grayfly and Blackfly.

Grayfly
Grayfly has been particularly active in recent years, mounting high volume espionage attacks
against organizations spread across Asia, Europe, and North America. They are interested in
a wide range of sectors, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing,
telecoms, and government. It is known for using the Barlaiy/POISONPLUG and
Crosswalk/ProxIP (Backdoor.Motnug) malware families in its attacks. Victims are frequently
compromised by exploiting public facing web servers.

In recent attacks, Symantec has seen Grayfly deploy Backdoor.Motnug against targeted
organizations in conjunction with publicly available Cobalt Strike malware. Backdoor.Motnug
provides the attackers with comprehensive remote access to the network and creates proxy
connections allowing access to hard-to-reach segments of a target network. In one attack
against a telecoms provider, Grayfly was seen using an internal tool capable of interacting
with an SMS database, demonstrating that intelligence gathering was the motive of the
attack.
Prosecutors in the U.S. have charged three Chinese men – Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, and Fu
Qiang – with involvement in attacks that involve Grayfly tools and tactics. The trio are based
in the Chinese city of Chengdu and all hold senior positions in a company called Chengdu
404. The company describes itself as a network security specialist and claims to employ a
team of white hat hackers who can perform penetration testing along with “offensive” and
“defensive” security operations.
The indictment alleges that the three men were also involved in attacks against over 100
different organizations in the U.S., South Korea, Japan, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, and
Thailand. Jiang was said to have a “working relationship” with the Chinese Ministry of State
Security which would provide him and his associates with a degree of state protection.

Blackfly
Blackfly has been active since at least 2010 and is known for attacks involving the
PlugX/Fast (Backdoor.Korplug), Winnti/Pasteboy (Backdoor.Winnti), and Shadowpad
(Backdoor.Shadowpad) malware families. The group is best known for its attacks on the
computer gaming industry. However, Symantec has also observed attacks on the
semiconductor, telecoms, materials manufacturing, pharmaceutical, media and advertising,
hospitality, natural resources, fintech, and food sectors.
Recent Blackfly activity observed by Symantec saw the group deploy a slightly modified
version of the Winnti malware against a telecoms organization in Taiwan. A feature of the
attack was their use of the names of security vendors in naming files in an attempt to avoid
raising suspicions. A dropper was signed with an invalid certificate with the subject "McAfee,
Inc." The dropper then delivered several DLLs with file names that referenced Symantec
software. The attackers had not compromised Symantec software, and were not leveraging it
in the attack.
In a separate indictment, prosecutors allege that two Malaysian nationals – Wong Ong Hua
and Ling Yang Ching – were involved in attacks that involved Blackfly tools and tactics.
Wong is the founder and CEO of a company called Sea Gamer Mall, while Ling is its chief
product officer and a shareholder. The duo are alleged to have collaborated with other
attackers to mount a string of attacks against computer game companies in order to obtain
in-game digital items, such as currencies, and then selling them for profit.
