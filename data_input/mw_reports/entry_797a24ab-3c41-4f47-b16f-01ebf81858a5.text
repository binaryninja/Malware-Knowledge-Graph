Ryuk Speed Run, 2 Hours to Ransom
thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/
November 5, 2020

Intro
Since the end of September Ryuk has been screaming back into the news. We’ve already
covered 2 cases in that timeframe. We’ve seen major healthcare providers, managed service
providers, and furniture manufactures all reportedly being hit. The Cyber Security and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an advisory claiming that a mass Ryuk
campaign against the United States healthcare system was an imminent threat.
FireEye released a post, and hosted a webinar with SANS and @likethecoins, detailing a
group FireEye identifies as UNC 1878. In their report, they describe a threat actor’s TTPs
that align with the activity we’ve previously reported on. They indicated in their investigations
and responses of seeing the group take just 2 to 5 days from entry to full domain
ransomware deployment. In our cases we’ve seen even faster action, with the threat actors
seemly trying to speed-run their ransomware deployment. In this most recent case,
ransomware was deployed in 2 hours with the actor completing all objectives in 3 hours.
Red Canary released a post recently on how they, with the support of Kroll, stopped a Ryuk
intrusion at a hospital. This report includes 10 detection ideas as well as a feel good story on
how they stopped the intrusion. We need more reports like this, especially right now.

SCYTHE recently put out an adversary emulation plan and a post based on our previous
Ryuk reports. You can check out the post here and the free emulation plan here. Great job
@jorgeorchilles, @seanqsun and the rest of the SCYTHE team for sharing this with the
community!

Case Summary
Like in our prior two reports of Ryuk campaigns, the initial access came from phishing emails
containing links to google drive that when clicked, downloaded a Bazar Loader backdoor
executable. In our prior cases we generally saw a lag time, ranging hours to days, from the
initial click to Ryuk. In this case, the time from initial Bazar execution to domain recon was 5
minutes, and deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons was within 10 minutes. This is by far the
quickest we have seen them act.
After bringing in Cobalt Strike, we saw familiar TTP’s with using AdFind to continue domain
discovery activity. In this case, we saw them deploy persistence on the beachhead host, an
action we had not previously seen in our other cases. After establishing another C2 for an
additional Cobalt Strike beacon, they employed the Zerologon exploit (CVE 2020-1472) and
obtained domain admin level privileges. We also saw host process injection on the
beachhead used for obfuscation and privilege escalation.
With domain administrator privileges obtained, the threat actors then moved laterally
throughout the network using SMB and RDP to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on the domain
controllers around 1 hour after the initial execution of Bazar. On the domain controllers, some
additional discovery was done using the PowerShell Active Directory module. From there,
they targeted other severs in the environment; specifically, back up systems, file servers, and
software deployment servers. After establishing Cobalt Strike beacons on those they felt
ready to proceed to their final objectives.
At the 2 hour mark the threat actors made the move to deploy Ryuk ransomware by
establishing RDP connections from the domain controllers to servers. This continued for the
next hour until the entire domain had been encrypted, with that work completing just 3 hours
after the first Bazar Loader was executed.

Timeline

MITRE ATT&CK
Initial Access
Initial access via a phishing email that linked to a google docs page that enticed the user to
download a report, which was a Bazar Loader executable file instead Report-Review2010.exe.

Execution
Execution of the initial Bazar Loader malware relies on user interaction.
Executables transferred over SMB during lateral movement were commonly executed via a
service.
Image: C:\Windows\system32\services.exe
TargetObject: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ff49429\ImagePath
Details: \\HOSTNAME\ADMIN$\ff49429.exe"

Persistence
This time, unlike prior investigations, clear persistence was found setup on the beachhead
host. Firefox.exe created these scheduled tasks as well as the run key.
"C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /CREATE /SC ONSTART /TN jf0c /TR
"'C:\Users\pagefilerpqy.exe'" /f
"C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /CREATE /SC ONSTART /TN jf0c /TR
"'C:\Users\pagefilerpqy.exe'" /f /RL HIGHEST

"C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /CREATE /SC ONCE /ST 17:21:58 /TN 9T6ukfi6 /TR

REG ADD "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /V \"microsoft update\"
/t REG_SZ /F /D "SCHTASKS /run /tn 9T6ukfi6"

Privilege Escalation
The Zerologon vulnerability CVE 2020-1472 was again exploited to obtain domain admin
level privileges.

4/19

Credential Access
Rubeus was used to kerberoast the environment.

Defense Evasion
Process injection was used on the beachhead host to to inject into svchost.exe

5/19

The Bazar Loader malware was using a code signing certificate signed by Digicert under the
organization NOSOV SP Z O O

At the time of delivery, the executable had a detection rate of 1/69 in Virustotal.

The Cobalt Strike beacons used in the environment used similar code signing certificates.

6/19

Discovery
In previous cases, we generally saw some lag time between infection and further actions but
this time things moved much quicker, starting with initial discovery executed by Bazar less
than 5 minutes after initial execution.
Discovery command run by Bazar:
net view /all
net view /all /domain
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
net localgroup "administrator"
net group "domain admins" /dom

Seven minutes later, after launching a Cobalt Strike beacon, AdFind was used– running the
same discovery pattern seen in previous reporting. This was started via a bat script. It
appears that the threat actors are now piping these commands into a batch file one at a time
instead of dropping adf.bat to disk.
AdFind.exe -f "(objectcategory=person)"
AdFind.exe -f "(objectcategory=computer)"
AdFind.exe -f "(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)"
AdFind.exe -sc trustdmp
AdFind.exe -subnets -f "(objectCategory=subnet)"
AdFind.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)"
AdFind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp

Once on the domain controller the PowerShell Active Directory module was loaded.

7/19

Lateral Movement
RDP connections were initiated from Cobalt Strike Beacons running on the beachhead host
to two domain controllers and then Cobalt Strike executables were dropped by these
connections.

In addition to using RDP to move around the environment execuatables were also
transferred over SMB to ADMIN$ shares and executed as a service.

Exfiltration
Discovery data (AdFind and Rubeus outputs ) was exfiltrated out of the network via FTP.

Impact
At roughly the 2 hour mark, we saw the threat actors begin to act on their final objectives.
RDP connections were initiated from one of the domain controllers and the Ryuk executables
were deployed and executed over these RDP connections. Servers such as the backup
systems, file servers, and automation tools were targeted first, followed by workstations.
Commands ran prior to ransom execution:

"icacls ""D:\*"" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q"

While encryption was started 2 hours into the attack, by the 3 hour mark the actors had
completed ransom of the entire environment.
