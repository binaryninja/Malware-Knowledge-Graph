Counter Threat Unit Research Team

Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers analyzed how the GOLD ULRICK
threat group, which operates the Conti name-and-shame ransomware scheme, has adapted
in response to the public disclosure of a significant amount of GOLD ULRICK
communications and operational details. CTU™ analysis indicates that the group is returning
to the levels of activity that represented a peak in 2021.

The Conti leak site listed an average of 43 victims per month in 2021. Despite a drop
following the Colonial Pipeline attack and a peak of 95 victims listed in November, the rate of
naming victims was fairly consistent. The decreased activity in December 2021 and January
2022 across all name-and-shame ransomware groups was likely due to a holiday break. The
number of victims added to the Conti leak site increased in February 2022. On February 27,
the @ContiLeaks Twitter persona began leaking GOLD ULRICK data and communications.
Despite these public disclosures, the number of Conti victims posted in March surged to the
second-highest monthly total since January 2021 (see Figure 1).

Although these types of leaks could have prompted some threat groups to modify their
communication methods or tooling, GOLD ULRICK appears to have continued and even
increased the tempo of its operations without disruption. GOLD ULRICK member 'Jordan
Conti' confirmed this continuation and the minimal impact of the disclosures in a March 31,
2022 post on the RAMP underground forum (see Figure 2). CTU researchers previously
observed this persona advertising Conti, providing updates on takedown efforts, and
recruiting affiliates.

The March 31 post claims that the Conti leak site only lists victims that have not paid the
ransom and that twice that number have been compromised. It suggests that Conti has a
50% payment success rate with an average payout of '700k'. The currency is not specified
but is likely to be U.S. dollars. CTU researchers are unable to verify these claims, but it is
reasonable to assume that the leak site does not list all victims.
'Jordan Conti' indicates that GOLD ULRICK continues to evolve its ransomware, intrusion
methods, and approaches to working with data. The Conti leak site added 11 victims in the
first four days of April. If GOLD ULRICK operations continue at that pace, the group will
continue to pose one of the most significant cybercrime threats to organizations globally.
