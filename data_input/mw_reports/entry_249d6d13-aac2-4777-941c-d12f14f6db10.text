Masad Stealer: Exfiltrating using Telegram
blogs.juniper.net/en-us/threat-research/masad-stealer-exfiltrating-using-telegram
September 26, 2019

Juniper Threat Labs discovered a new Trojan-delivered spyware that uses Telegram to exfiltrate stolen information. Using
Telegram as a Command and Control (C&C) channel allows the malware some anonymity, as Telegram is a legitimate
messaging application with 200 million monthly active users.
The malware is being advertised on black market forums as “Masad Clipper and Stealer.” It steals browser data, which might
contain usernames, passwords and credit card information. Masad Stealer also automatically replaces cryptocurrency
wallets from the clipboard with its own.
Masad Stealer sends all of the information it collects – and receive commands from – a Telegram bot controlled by the threat
actor deploying that instance of Masad. Because Masad is being sold as off-the-shelf malware, it will be deployed by
multiple threat actors who may or may not be the original malware writers.
What it does
This malware is written using Autoit scripts and then compiled into a Windows executable. Most samples we have seen are
about 1.5 MiB in size, however, Masad Stealer can be found in larger executables as it is sometimes bundled into other
software.
When Masad Stealer is executed, it drops itself in %APPDATA%\folder_name}\{file_name}, where folder_name and
file_name are defined in the binary. Examples include amd64_usbhub3.inf.resources and ws2_32.exe, respectively. As a
persistence mechanism, mMasad Stealer creates a scheduled task that will start itself every one minute.

Stealing routine
After installing itself, Masad Stealer starts by collecting sensitive information from the system, such as:
Cryptocurrency Wallets
PC and system information
Credit Card Browser Data
Browser passwords
Installed software and processes
Desktop Files
Screenshot of Desktop
Browser cookies

1/10

Steam files
AutoFill browser fields
Discord and Telegram data
FileZilla files
It zips this information into a file using 7zip utility, which is bundled into the malware binary.

The above screenshot is a view of what Masad Stealer tries to exfiltrate from a sandbox. But the data that it can exfiltrate
can expand to the following list:

Using a hardcoded bot token, which is basically a way to communicate with the Command and Control bot, Masad Stealer
sends this zip file using the sendDocument API.

In order to communicate with the Command and Control bot, Masad Stealer first sends a getMe message using the bot
token to be able to confirm that the bot is still active. Upon receiving this request, the bot replies with the user object that
contains the username of the bot. This username object is useful for identifying possible threat actors related to this
malware. This is an important consideration because of the off-the-shelf nature of this malware – multiple parties will be
operating Masad Stealer instances for different purposes.

Clipping Routine
This malware includes a function that replaces wallets on the clipboard, as soon as it matches a particular configuration.
Below are the regular expressions and supported wallets that it matches against the clipboard data:

If the clipboard data matches one of the patterns coded into Masad Stealer, the malware replaces the clipboard data with
one of the threat actors’ wallets, which are also found in its binary. Below are the bitcoin and monero wallets found in one of
the samples:

Below is a snapshot of the bitcoin wallet transaction, as of this writing. This wallet has already received around $9,000 USD
equivalent of bitcoins (as of Sept 15, 2019), which may or may not come from the activity of this malware.

Attack Vector
Based on our telemetry, Masad Stealer’s main distribution vectors are masquerading as a legitimate tool or bundling
themselves into third party tools. Threat actors achieve end user downloads by advertising in forums, on third party
download sites or on file sharing sites. Below are the currently known list of software that Masad Stealer has been seen
mimicking:
ProxySwitcher (legitimate version here: https://www.proxyswitcher.com/)
CCleaner.exe (legitimate version here: https://ccleaner.com/)
Utilman.exe (legitimate version comes with Windows)
Netsh.exe (legitimate version comes with Windows)
Iobit v 1.7.exe (legitimate version here:https://www.iobit.com/)
Base Creator v1.3.1 [FULL CRACK].exe (there is no legitimate version)
EXEA HACK CRACKED (PUBG,CS GO,FORTNITE,GTA 5,DOTA).exe (there is no legitimate version)
Icacls.exe (legitimate version comes with Windows)
WSManHTTPConfig.exe (legitimate version comes with Windows)
RADMIR CHEAT MONEYY.exe (there is no legitimate version)
Tradebot_binance.exe (legitimate version here: https://tradesanta.com/en)
Whoami.exe (legitimate version comes with Windows)
Proxo Bootstrapper.exe (this is actually a reasonably popular form of malware)
Fortniteaimbot 2019.exe (there is no legitimate version)
Galaxy Software Update.exe (https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00077582/)
Download additional malware
Some samples of Masad Stealer have the capability to download additional malware. We have seen samples that download
other malware, usually a miner, from these URLs:
https://masadsasad[.]moy.su/base.txt (miner)
https://zuuse[.]000webhostapp.com/mi.exe (miner)
http://37[.]230.210.84/still/Build.exe
http://37[.]230.210.84/still/SoranoMiner.exe
http://187[.]ip-54-36-162.eu/steal.exe
http://bgtyu73[.]ru/22/Build.exe

Masad stealer downloading a miner via HTTPS and with modified header
The figure above is a response from the request to https://masadsasad[.]moy.su/base.txt. This response contains an
executable file with modified header. In addition to connecting via TLS, the modified header is an added trick by the malware
to hide itself.
TLS streams are more difficult to inspect, helping to hide them from network-based security defenses. The modified header
helps to hide the fact that the payload being downloaded is an executable from endpoint security products.
Threat Actors
This malware is being advertised in several hack forums as Masad Stealer. It starts with a free version and ladders up to
versions asking up to $85, with each tier of the malware offering different features.

Sample Masad stealer ad found in hackforums
There is at least one dedicated website (masadproject[.]life) in existence to promote the sale of Masad Stealer. The
developers have also created a Telegram group for their potential clients, and presumably to offer tech support. At time of
writing, this group has more than 300 members.

Of the more than 1,000 samples we identified to be variants of this malware, there where 338 unique Telegram Command
and Control bot IDs. From this data, we can estimate the number of threat actors – or at least the number of different
campaigns being run using the Masad Stealer malware – and the size of their operations. We used the getMe API, along
with the bot token, to identify the usernames. Among the top bot IDs are as follows:

Previous versions of this malware (or possibly a direct ancestor) are called “Qulab Stealer”.
How does Juniper Networks protect you against this?
Juniper Advanced Threat Protection products JATP and Sky ATP use machine learning to be able to accurately identify
malware. The following images show the Sky ATP detecting multiple variations of this malware.

Juniper Sky ATP’s detection of this malware family
The use of machine learning is critical to defending against this malware because of the number of rapid iterations it
underwent throughout its development. Machine learning allows Juniper Connected Security to identify Masad Stealer
variants as they emerge, helping to keep customers protected even before new strains have been identified.
Conclusion
Juniper Threat Labs believes that Masad Stealer represents an active and ongoing threat. Command and Control bots are
still alive and responding as of this writing, and the malware appears to still be available for purchase on the black market.
In order to protect your organization, make sure that you have a next generation firewall (NGFW) with Advanced Threat
Protection. NGFWs have the ability to identify the Telegram protocol and block it, if there is no legitimate business use, while
Advanced Threat Protection products offer other methods to detect and counteract this malware.
Juniper Sky ATP, in conjunction with our SRX firewall will block any client infected with Masad Stealer from reaching out to
the Command and Control bot master. It will also block the download of the Masad Stealer malware files in the first place,
offering both remediation and prevention capabilities.
