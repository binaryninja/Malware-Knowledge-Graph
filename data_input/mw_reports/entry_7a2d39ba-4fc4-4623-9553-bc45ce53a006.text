FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Report
Affected platforms: Atlassian’s Confluence
Impacted parties: Confluence Server or Data Center instance
Impact: An OGNL injection vulnerability exists that would allow an unauthenticated user to
execute arbitrary code
Severity level: Critical

Introduction of CVE-2021-26084
In August 2021, Atlassian published a security advisory about CVE-2021-26084 that could
enable a threat actor to run arbitrary code on unpatched Confluence Server and Data Center
instances. FortiGuard Labs analyzed the situation and published a Threat Signal with
relevant information. After releasing the advisory, there occur massive scanning and proof-of1/6

concept exploit code in public. We also collect a lot attacking traffic. In this blog we will
analyze the payloads leveraging this vulnerability, deep dive into the attack and summarize
the IOCs for these suspicious activities that may hint the network was affected by CVE-202126084.

Overview of CVE-2021-26084 Incidents
In September, we observed numerous threat actors targeting this vulnerability whose goal
was to download a malicious payload that would install a backdoor or miner in a user’s
network. These threats include Cryptojacking, Setag backdoor, Fileless attack that uses
PowerShell in a system to execute shell without file dropped and Muhstik botnet; we will
elaborate each of them in this analysis.
Although there are different attack vectors for this vulnerability, all of these attacks are
targeting the parameter “queryString” which is shown in following packet capture:

Cryptojacking
After exploiting CVE-2021-26084, it downloads init.sh from 86.105.195[.]120. The shell is a
crypto miner that includes following tasks:
1. Delete syslog
2. Change commonly used command
3. Stop aliyun services and apparmor
4. Set the path for miner execution file (zzh) and itself but rename as newinit.sh
5. Kill all other miner processes
6. Use crontab to establish persistence
7. Get scanning shell (is.sh)
8. Clean the trace
Payload Exploits CVE-2021-26084
Inti.sh
In the scanning shell, it will try to download a scanning tool, like Masscan, Pnscan, etc, which
can be used to scan and survey IPv4 TCP network in order to discover live host to proceed
the spreading. The downloader path is shown as below. It also downloads a shell that
defines specific steps for the scan. First, get the login brute force tool hxx (md5:
f0551696774f66ad3485445d9e3f7214) and account/password list ps (md5:
a43ad8a740081f0b5a89e219fe8475a3), then scan the subnet belong to private network
(172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8). This is to allow the malware to login into
more devices in victim’s intranet and spread miner script (init.sh).

Setag
The following exploit traffic was observed from IP address 86.105.195.154 (AS 3164 Astimp
IT Solution SRL). Setag, also known as BillGates or Ganiw, belongs to a well-known
malware family that targets server via 1 day vulnerability. It mainly uses
UDP/SYN/ICMP/DNS floods to conduct DDoS attack. But it also has various command can
check its own status or control their victims. The command for dos attack or controlling their
victims can be seen in following rawdata:
Syna

Fileless Attack
The observed packet is from 141.98.83.139 (AS 209588 Flyservers S.A.) and the main
payload is b64 encoded. The decoded data is as follow:
First layer decoded data
We can see that the payload is constructed and executed via PowerShell. The final
execution will set “WindowStyle” to hidden and “CreateNoWindow” to True, which is to put
itself out of sight. We decoded those data in the middle and replace {0} and {1} with “=” and
“P”, then 2nd layer payload data
Second layer payload data
It defined two functions, and one variable that contain the main exploit code. After converting
the code in $sG, it will use VirtualAlloc to reserve a part of memory. Then it uses
CreateThread to invoke the malicious code. So what exactly $sG is? After b64 decoding, we
get about 570 bytes binary data as below:
570 bytes binary data
To dive deep in to this, we have to check this binary by IDA. Following the first call into
loc_D6, it puts ws2_32 and move edx, 726774ch, and this is the hash value of LoadLibrary
function, the detail code is as below:

It is a reverse shell meterpreter shellcode that connects to exploit source 141.98.83[.]139 via
tcp port 23733. Since the port now is closed, we only managed to capture the following
packets. But the entire attack process only leveraged PowerShell to decode layer by layer,
and uses hidden window style to hide itself. And finally, create a thread to achieve the
reverse shell. Not a single file is dropped in the entire attack, which is known as fileless
attack.

Muhstik
By exploiting CVE-2021-26084, it downloads conf2 from 149.28.85[.]17. The file will deploy
and execute dk86 from 188.166.137[.]241 and ldm script. The attack scenario afterward is
analyzed in this article, but we observed a different server IP and more attack source IP
which is intended to spread conf2 of Muhstik.

Conclusion
We have been tracking this vulnerability for weeks and observing massive threat exploitation
targeting Atlassian Confluence. Although the patch for CVE-2021-26084 is already released,
public attacks are still undergoing. In this post, we gave detail of those attacks and illustrate
how they using the payload to deliver malware, users should upgrade the system
immediately and also apply Fortiguard protection to avoid the threat probing.

Fortinet Protections
For vulnerability CVE-2021-26084, Fortinet already release IPS signature
Atlassian.Confluence.CVE-2021-26084.Remote.Code.Execution for it to proactive protect
our customer. For payloads described are detected and blocked by the FortiGuard AntiVirus.
