Ransomware has become the biggest threat to online security, affecting all industries
connected to the internet, from supply chains to healthcare institutions.
Therefore, a critical part of Binance’s commitment to ensuring the secure and sustainable
growth of the global crypto ecosystem involves fighting different strains of ransomware and
fraud. Earlier this year we released a case study on our first Bulletproof Exchanger Project, a
dedicated anti-ransomware initiative where we worked with the Ukraine Cyber Police to
arrest a major cybercriminal group laundering over $42M of illicit funds.
More recently Binance Security has been taking part in an international investigation with
Ukraine Cyber Police, Cyber Bureau of Korean National Police Agency, US Law
Enforcement, Spanish Civil Guard, and Swiss Federal Office of Police, among others, in
apprehending a prolific cybercriminal ring. The group -- also known as FANCYCAT -- has
been running multiple criminal activities: distributing cyber attacks; operating a high-risk
exchanger; and laundering money from dark web operations and high-profile cyber attacks
such as Cl0p and Petya ransomware. In all, FANCYCAT is responsible for over $500M worth
of damages in connection with ransomware and millions more from other cybercrimes.
Operation FANCYCAT
Over the past year we have expanded our in-house AML detection and analytics capabilities.
Based on our research and analysis, as well as our understanding of cybercriminals' history
and cashout tactics, we arrived at the conclusion that the biggest security problem in the
industry today is money connected to cyber attacks being laundered through nested services
and parasite exchanger accounts that live inside macro VASPs, including exchanges like
Binance.com. These criminals enjoy taking advantage of reputable exchanges’ liquidity,
diverse digital asset offerings and well-developed APIs.
In a majority of the cases associated with illicit blockchain flows coming onto exchanges, the
exchange is not harboring the actual criminal group themselves, but rather being used as a
middleman to launder stolen profits. Figure 1 shows an example of the money laundering
process on an exchange in relation to cyber attacks:

Blockchain analysis shows a network of money launderers living inside macro exchanges
which deposit and withdraw to each other to wash the money. Understanding this diagnosis,
we are taking the necessary steps to prevent illicit activity. We are applying a two-pronged
approach: 1) implementing our own detection mechanisms to identify and offboard
suspicious accounts 2) collaborating with law enforcement to build cases and take down
criminal groups.
We applied the two-pronged approach to the FANCYCAT investigation: our AML detection
and analytics program detected suspicious activity on Binance.com and expanded the
suspect cluster. Once we mapped out the complete suspect network, we worked with private
sector chain analytics companies TRM Labs and Crystal (BitFury) to analyze on-chain
activity and gain a better understanding of this group and its attribution. Based on our
analysis we found that this specific group was not only associated with laundering Cl0p
attack funds, but also with Petya and other illegally-sourced funds. This led to the
identification and eventual arrest of FANCYCAT.
We are continuing to investigate the FANCYCAT criminal syndicate across multiple
jurisdictions and the connections associated with other cyber attacks.
Making the International Crypto Ecosystem a Safer Place
At Binance, we believe that strong controls across exchanges, smart legislation and ongoing
education will help immensely with weeding out bad actors. Projects such as our “Bulletproof
Exchanger” and our ongoing partnerships with law enforcement, as well as security and
blockchain analytics firms, will be a driving force in improving the cybersecurity measures
across the wider crypto industry.
