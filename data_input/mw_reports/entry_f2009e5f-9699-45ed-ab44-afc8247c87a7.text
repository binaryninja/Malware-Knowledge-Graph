Information stealer (infostealer) malware—malicious software designed to steal victim
information, including passwords—has become one of the most discussed malware types
on the cybercriminal underground in 2022 according to Accenture’s Cyber Threat
Intelligence team (ACTI). This is due to infostealers’ ability to harvest cookie data,
usernames, and passwords, their cheap cost, and their availability as a malware-as-aservice offering, which allows actors with few resources or little technical knowledge to
deploy the malware and access others’ networks.
While more organizations worldwide are implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) at
an increasing rate to protect against the theft of user credentials, this protection is proving
insufficient. In 2022, ACTI saw cyber threat actors successfully combine stolen credentials
and social engineering to carry out high-profile breaches; the success of those breaches
only further increased the demand for infostealers on the dark web. In addition, the volume
of victim data included in logs for sale on underground marketplaces rose between June
and October of 2022. The popularity spike in infostealers also drove underground actors to
advertise on the dark web a variety of new infostealer malware variants.
MFA fatigue attacks
In 2022, the high-profile breaches of several large organizations illustrated the ease at
which threat actors can breach network defenses using stolen employee credentials and
leveraging MFA fatigue attacks. MFA fatigue attacks involve repeated attempts to log on to
an MFA-enabled account using stolen credentials, thereby bombarding a potential victim
with MFA push requests. In such scenarios, some MFA request recipients accept MFA
requests to stop the requests from appearing on connected devices, unknowingly granting
criminal access to the now-victims’ systems. In one such attack, threat actors also used a
popular messaging app to contact victims, purporting to be the victim organization’s IT
department and social engineering the victim into accepting MFA requests.
The notorious LAPSUS$ group relied on MFA fatigue attacks for several of its operations in
2022. Microsoft investigated LAPSUS$ and concluded the group had obtained credentials
by:
Deploying the malicious RedLine infostealer to obtain passwords and session tokens.

Purchasing credentials and session tokens on criminal underground forums.
Paying employees at targeted organizations or their suppliers and business partners
for access to credentials and MFA approvals.
Searching public code repositories for exposed credentials.
This group serves as just one example of real-world criminal use of infostealers in
combination with MFA fatigue attacks that have contributed to the surge in popularity for
infostealers and the growth of compromised credential marketplaces.
The rise of compromised credential marketplaces
ACTI monitors several of the most prominent compromised credential marketplaces and
found a marked increase in the number of logs for sale from July to October 2022.
Russian Market
Access to the Russian Market site allows visitors to search for inventory by malware used,
victim operating system, and victim location. This site was among the most popular markets
in 2022 based on volume of logs available for sale, with victim data sold for an average
price of $10 per log. The total number of logs for sale in this market rose by nearly 40%
from approximately 3.3 million to 4.5 million between July and October 2022.
Malware
In log advertisements, Russian Market vendors include the malware they used to obtain
credentials for sale. So far in 2022, RedLine, Raccoon Stealer, Vidar, Taurus, and AZORult
are the five infostealers actors have used to obtain the logs on Russian Market (see Figure
1). Between July and October 2022, RedLine remained the dominant infostealer; however,
its use decreased from 56% of the total market to 48% in October 2022. Use of the popular
Raccoon Stealer, on the other hand, increased from 11% to 22% between July and October
2022, coinciding with the release of Raccoon Stealer v2 on June 30, 2022.

Victimology
From July to October 2022, the top three countries with the highest number of infostealer
victims on Russian Market were India, Indonesia, and Brazil. These countries making up
the highest number of infostealer victims is likely due to the vast population of each country
combined with a relative low level of cybersecurity awareness in each nation. Between July
and October 2022, the number of infostealer victims in these counties increased by 33% in
India, 30% in Indonesia, and 40% in Brazil. The remaining seven of the top 10 countries
were Pakistan, Vietnam, Egypt, Thailand, Philippines, Turkey, and the U.S.
What’s next?
Shift toward private sales for quality logs
Private log sales, which are common on dark web forums, usually involve sellers fostering
relationships with trusted buyers who are willing to pay a little more than buyers on open
marketplaces. Often, sellers offer the best logs to trusted buyers first and sell the remaining
logs on marketplace’s general pages. While ACTI expects marketplaces selling infostealerobtained logs to continue to thrive, the ever-increasing volume of stolen data available on
these forums will lead to the highest-quality logs inevitably becoming harder to find as
trusted buyers begin to obtain high-value logs through private sales.
To cater to buyers wanting high-quality logs, the operators of Russian Market added a preorder option on the forum's Stealer Logs section in October 2022. Users with a balance of
US$1,000 in their general accounts on the site can provide a list of domains they wish to

target and will receive notifications of the availability of logs affecting those domains before
those logs become available to the rest of the market.
Cybercriminals advertise wave of new infostealer-related products on the dark web
With the success of infostealers in 2022, there have been a wave of advertisements for new
variants of stealers, enhanced infostealers, and infostealer source code available on the
cybercriminal underground. The following is a table of notable related advertisements on
dark web forums from July to October 2022:

2022
The sale of these new strains, combined with the availability of enhanced infostealers and
infostealer source code will lead to increased dark web log sale activity both on
marketplaces’ “public” spaces and through private sales.
New kids on the block
Meta Stealer
While Raccoon, Redline, and Vidar continue to account for the majority of dark web
marketplace stock, one new infostealer has forced its way in: Meta Stealer. Underground
users first advertised this infostealer on cybercrime forums in March 2022, with
advertisements stating that developers heavily based its code on that of Redline but that

4/9

Meta Stealer had additional features and was less detectible by anti-virus and endpoint
detection software. As of November 2022, Meta Stealer costs US$150 per month or
US$1,000 for a lifetime license.
Since May 2022, Meta Stealer logs have been appearing on 2easy Market, which has
added approximately 13,000 logs as of November 4, 2022. ACTI expects Meta Stealer to
see increased popularity as those behind more-established strains lose interest, lose
control, or find it too tough to continue to bypass anti-virus and endpoint protection
software.
Rhadamanthys
As Figure 2 references, the Rhadamanthys infostealer appeared on the Exploit forum on
August 29, 2022. The following factors indicate Rhadamanthys is a genuine, powerful
infostealer and ads for it are not scams or for sales of a revamped version of previously
leaked malware code:
Very positive feedback (commenters on the forum thread have praised the quality of
the build and its low anti-virus software detection rate)
The level of detail on the infostealer the actors operating the forum thread provided
The use of a guarantor
The samples of the malware the sellers shared with forum members
The support of the actors behind the Rhadamanthys forum accounts
ACTI assesses Rhadamanthys is a powerful tool for those looking to gain access to
corporate networks. The malware can obtain credentials and information from a host of
platforms including major browsers, email clients, messaging platforms, and crypto apps
and wallets. In addition, it targets logs from MFA apps, including Authenticator, Authy, EOS
Authenticator, and GAuth Authenticator, as well as Outlook and Slack, and harvests
cookies. This infostealer can also use a control panel to export cookies (Figure 3) and plug
them into a bespoke browser, which helps bypass the need for passwords to access
targeted domains. The bespoke browser is Genesium—the browser the operators of the
underground marketplace Genesis Market created and have used.

ACTI expects to see Rhadamanthys grow in popularity and become a market leader, and
for other dark web infostealer vendors to look to emulate this level of success.
Law enforcement action unlikely to stem the tide
On October 26, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the arrest of a major
player behind the Raccoon Stealer operation and the FBI stated it had dismantled Raccoon
Stealer infrastructure. However, on October 30, 2022, the operators of the "raccoonstealer"
account on the Exploit forum stated the project is still running and servers remain safe, as
Figure 4 illustrates.

Regardless of whether the arrest ultimately affects Raccoon Stealer operations, it might
motivate other actors to try to fill the space Raccoon Stealer could leave behind.
Conclusion and mitigation
ACTI expects the infostealer landscape to continue to evolve and pose a significant risk to
organizations in 2023. Organizations should examine how they authenticate user access to
their systems and consider moving away from MFA push notifications and toward numbermatching MFA systems and the use of biometrics to dull the effects of infostealers.
Organizations should also fully train staff on the dangers of MFA fatigue attacks, social
engineering attempts, and how to secure online accounts. Monitoring of dark web sources
to obtain threat intelligence on the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures relating to
infostealer malware should also help get ahead of the latest threats in this sphere.
