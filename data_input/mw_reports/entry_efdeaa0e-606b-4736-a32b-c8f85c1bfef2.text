malware disguised as pro-Ukraine cyber tools

Update March 17, 2022: Cisco Talos has updated the IOC section with additional hashes and
ClamAV coverage.

Executive summary
Opportunistic cybercriminals are attempting to exploit Ukrainian sympathizers by
offering malware purporting to be offensive cyber tools to target Russian entities. Once
downloaded, these files infect unwitting users rather than delivering the tools originally
advertised.
In one such instance, we observed a threat actor offering a distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) tool on Telegram intended to be used against Russian websites. The
downloaded file is actually an information stealer that infects the unwitting victim with
malware designed to dump credentials and cryptocurrency-related information.

These observations serve as reminders that users must be on heightened alert to
increased cyber threat activity as threat actors look for new ways to incorporate the
Russia-Ukraine conflict into their operations.
Such activity could take the form of themed email lures on news topics or donation
solicitations, malicious links purporting to host relief funds or refugee support sites,
malware masquerading as defensive or offensive security tools, and more. We remind
users to carefully inspect suspicious emails before opening them and validating
software or other files before downloading them.

Campaign details
The ongoing situation in Ukraine has quickly changed the cyber threat landscape,
introducing an influx of actors of varying skill and a variety of new threats to Cisco customers
and users globally. Many of these changes have been brought about by the rise in attacks
being outsourced to sympathetic people on the internet, which brings about its own unique
challenges and threats that Cisco Talos outlined in a recent blog.
In one of these new developments, we are seeing cybercriminals take advantage of the
conflict by exploiting unwitting users seeking tools to carry out their own cyber attacks
against Russian entities. A variety of these tools are advertised as ways to target Russian or
pro-Russian websites and have quickly spread on various social media platforms over the
last few days as the interest in crowdsourced attacks grows. A simple search for "Ukraine" or
"Russia" on some popular open-source platforms returns a wide array of results. Most of the
tools that have been released thus far are meant to disrupt various state-affiliated targets
through distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. However, downloading any of these
tools can be risky. In addition to the obvious potential legal implications of conducting a selfdirected cyber attack, there is no way to know what other hidden features the tool may have
or if it's going to operate in its advertised fashion.
One of the main ways we are seeing these types of offerings advertised and distributed is on
the Telegram encrypted messaging app, which is extremely popular in eastern Europe and is
heavily used by both Ukrainians and Russians. We've seen lots of communications from both
sides, including links to Telegram channels associated with various sympathetic groups, such
as the IT Army of Ukraine. During our ongoing monitoring of some of these spaces, we found
the message shown below.

Infostealer disguised as a Russian attack tool on Telegram.
There is a tool called "Liberator" that is produced by a group called disBalancer that we
found relatively quickly. Liberator is advertised as a tool for performing DDoS attacks against
"Russian propaganda websites." A quick look at disBalancer's website shows that the actor
uses similar language to the malicious message on Telegram above and promises to target
Russian sites with the stated goal of helping to "liberate" Ukraine. A spelling error can be
seen in the below graphic from the site, where the group's name is misspelled as
"disBalancher."

Cisco Talos did some quick analysis of the legitimate Disbalancer Liberator tool shown above
and didn't find anything overtly malicious. However, it is effectively a DDoS client that, when
used, launches attacks against a list of targets downloaded from a server, something that is
potentially illegal. The file offered on the Telegram page ended up being malware, specifically
an infostealer designed to compromise unwitting users. The malware in this case dumps a
variety of credentials and a large amount of cryptocurrency-related information, including
wallets and metamask information, which is commonly associated with non-fungible tokens
(NFTs).

This is an example of one of the many ways opportunistic cybercriminals are attempting to
take advantage of the Russian invasion by exploiting sympathizers on both sides of the
conflict. Such activity could take the form of themed email lures on news topics or donation
solicitations, malicious links purporting to host relief funds or refugee support sites, malware
masquerading as security defensive or offensive tools, and more. Users must carefully
inspect suspicious emails before opening them and validate software or other files before
downloading them.

Infostealer details
The campaign is based on a dropper disguised as the Disbalancer.exe tool. This dropper is
protected with ASProtect, a known packer for Windows executables. If a researcher tries to
debug the malware execution, it will be confronted with a general error. The malware, after
performing the anti-debug checks, will launch Regsvcs.exe, which is included along with the
.NET framework. In this case, the regsvcs.exe is not used as a living off the land binary
(LoLBin). It is injected with the malicious code, which consists of the Phoenix information
stealer.
The actors behind this activity have been distributing infostealers since at least November
2021. This supports our belief that this is not the work of new actors, but existing actors
taking advantage of the war in Ukraine. The ZIP file provided in the Telegram channel
contains an executable, which is the infostealer. The infostealer gathers information from a
variety of sources, including web browsers like Firefox and Chrome and other locations on
the filesystem for key pieces of information. This information is then sent to a remote IP
address, in this case, a Russian IP — 95[.]142.46.35 — on port 6666. This particular IP/port
pair has been distributing infostealers since at least November 2021. As shown in the
deobfuscated screen capture below, the information, which is sent with a simple base64
encoding, shows the breadth of information being pulled off of the systems, including a large
number of crypto wallets and MetaMask (a cryptocurrency wallet software) information.
Following the summary, a ZIP file of the stolen data is also uploaded to the server,
completing the compromise.

Sample data exfiltrated by infostealer.
This is the behavior of modern infostealers. They place increased focus on obtaining
cryptocurrency information, as this can be quickly stolen and immediately monetized with a
much lower threshold than other types of data that is being stolen, namely credentials
themselves.
Pivoting on the sample itself has shown that it is being distributed through other means,
using other names including peview.exe and ddos-reaper.exe. We also found other malware
samples communicating with this command and control (C2) IP address.

6/10

Conclusion
Cisco Talos constantly observes actors using any and all means to get their malware
installed on systems, and the war in Ukraine is no exception. In this case, we found some
cybercriminals distributing an infostealer, but it could have just as easily been a more
sophisticated state-sponsored actor or privateer group doing work on behalf of a nationstate. We remind users to be wary of installing software whose origins are unknown,
especially software that is being dropped into random chat rooms on the internet.
Cisco Talos expects this type of behavior to continue and diversify. The global interest in the
conflict creates a massive potential victim pool for threat actors and also contributes to a
growing number of people interested in carrying out their own offensive cyber operations.
