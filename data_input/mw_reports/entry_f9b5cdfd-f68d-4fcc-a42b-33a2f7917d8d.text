The U.S. government and Russian cybersecurity giant Kaspersky Lab are currently in the
throes of a nasty legal fight that comes on top of a long-running feud over how the company
has conducted itself with regard to U.S. intelligence-gathering operations.
A recent Kaspersky discovery may keep the feud alive for years to come.
CyberScoop has learned that Kaspersky research recently exposed an active, U.S.-led
counterterrorism cyber-espionage operation. According to current and former U.S.
intelligence officials, the operation was used to target ISIS and al-Qaeda members.

On March 9, Kaspersky publicly announced a malware campaign dubbed “Slingshot.”
According to the company’s researchers, the campaign compromised thousands of devices
through breached routers in various African and Middle Eastern countries, including
Afghanistan, Iraq, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, Turkey and Yemen.
Kaspersky did not attribute Slingshot to any single country or government in its public report,
describing it only as an advanced persistent threat (APT). But current and former U.S.
intelligence officials tell CyberScoop that Slingshot represents a U.S. military program run out
of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), a component of Special Operations
Command (SOCOM).
The complex campaign, which researchers say was active for at least six years, allowed for
the spread of highly intrusive malware that could siphon large amounts of data from infected
devices.
Slingshot helped the military and intelligence community collect information about terrorists
by infecting computers they commonly used, sources told CyberScoop. Often times, these
targeted computers would be located within internet cafés in developing countries. ISIS and
al-Qaeda targets would use internet cafés to send and receive messages, the sources said.
These officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a classified program,
fear the exposure may cause the U.S. to lose access to a valuable, long-running surveillance
program and put soldiers’ lives at risk.
The disclosure comes at a difficult time for Kaspersky. The company is currently fighting the
U.S. government in court after the government claimed that the Moscow-based company’s
software poses a national security risk due to the company’s Russian government ties.
Kaspersky has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
CyberScoop’s reporting of JSOC’s role in Slingshot provides the first known case of a
SOCOM-led cyber-espionage operation. The command is better known for leading physical
missions that place elite soldiers on the ground in hostile territories. Over the last decade,
SOCOM has been instrumental in the Global War on Terror, having conducted many
sensitive missions, including the one that killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
Slingshot, CyberScoop has learned, is a complement to JSOC’s physical missions.
A former intelligence official told CyberScoop that Kaspersky’s findings had likely already
caused the U.S. to abandon and “burn” some of the digital infrastructure that JSOC was
using to manage the surveillance program.
“SOP [standard operating procedure] is to kill it all with fire once you get caught,” said the
former intelligence official. “It happens sometimes and we’re accustomed to dealing with it.
But it still sucks … I can tell you this didn’t help anyone.”

SOCOM has hackers?
While not an intelligence agency by nature, SOCOM has dabbled in cyber-operations —
known inside the unit as “special reconnaissance” — for some time, according to multiple
academics who have examined the use of offensive cyber tools within special operations
units. Most of these operations would usually combine elements of human (HUMINT) and
signals intelligence (SIGINT) in order to catch terrorists.
As the Global War on Terror grew, most combatant commands took visible steps and
received considerable funding to build out their own espionage capabilities. One of the
military organizations which benefited most from this explosive growth in resources was
SOCOM, a unit that many describe as the “tip of the spear” when it comes to military
operations.
“Many units within SOCOM possess independent cyber capabilities,” a senior U.S.
intelligence official told CyberScoop.
Throughout the past decade, SOCOM has used cyber operations in a very ad hoc manner. If
cyberwarfare was used in an operation, SOCOM has either been given support from U.S.
Cyber Command or reliant on smaller squadrons within various units.
For instance, a group of hackers organized under the name “Computer Network Operations
Squadron” (CNOS), were known to operate within JSOC command circa 2007. Though
headquartered in Northern Virginia, CNOS helped coordinate missions where on-the-ground
agents in the Middle East — and sometimes undercover operatives — would infiltrate
internet cafés and local telecommunications firms. The squadron was first written about in
“Relentless Strike: The Secret History of Joint Special Operations Command,” a book by
journalist Sean Naylor.
Naylor wrote that CNOS staff could be stationed around the world, including at Fort Meade in
Maryland and CIA’s Langley, Virginia, headquarters. CNOS had close connections to
CIA, blurring the already fuzzy line between U.S. intel and military organizations.
In one case mentioned by Naylor’s book, CNOS infected a terrorist’s computer with
“keystroke recognition [software], at other times it would covertly activate a webcam if the
computer had one, allowing the task force to positively identify a target.”
The Slingshot program found by Kaspersky had similar capabilities.
SOCOM’s exclusive structure provides an easy way to leverage long-standing intelligence
programs, since it is permitted to quickly organize and deploy forces globally wherever
defined rules of engagement exist. Teams like CNOS, as described by Naylor, are usually
able to work closely with intelligence agencies in foreign, undefined war-zones after receiving
approval from the appropriate regional combatant commands and Pentagon.

JSOC and CIA have a history of working together and when combined, meet a similar profile
to how Slingshot would be utilized.
“The military kept CNOS in JSOC ‘because we want it to operate in areas that are not
necessarily … where we’re currently at war’ … we want it to operate around the globe
[pursuing] national objectives,” a passage in Naylor’s book, citing an unnamed military
intelligence officer, reads. “[CNOS] was how the pesky networks were broken in Iraq.”

Slingshot’s ties to spies
One Kaspersky researcher involved with the Slingshot report said the malware campaign
illustrated one of the most skilled and sophisticated hacking operations ever to be publicly
documented. Its creators took numerous steps to hide their identity and purpose, making
Slingshot extremely difficult to study, explained Kurt Baumgartner, a principal security
researcher with Kaspersky.
Baumgartner, a U.S. citizen, did not author the Slingshot report. Instead, a team of four
researchers based overseas, largely in Russia, are credited with writing it.
“It is one of the most technically sophisticated groups we’ve ever seen,” said Baumgartner.
“Most of the code is entirely unique, meaning that no one has ever seen it before … the only
overlap we’ve seen, and I think there are people already discussing it, is there’s some limited
similarities maybe to Equation Grayfish and White Lambert.”
“Grayfish” is a software implant associated with the “Equation Group,” an entity that is widely
attributed to the National Security Agency. The “Lamberts,” another group identified and first
catalogued by Kaspersky, has been separately linked to the CIA.
Hacking tools tied to past Equation Group and Lambert-inspired operations were written in
English, just like Slingshot. Akin to Grayfish and Lamberts, Slingshot used a distinct software
driver abuse technique to install malicious code onto targeted systems. They are the only
three documented APTs to use this exact same driver abuse method.
Broadly speaking, Kaspersky’s ability to identify even the most advanced malware variants is
well-documented; especially within the highly competitive cybersecurity community. Most of
these cases are handled by Kaspersky’s heralded Global Research & Analysis Team
(GReAT) team. The Russian company is known for employing some of the best reverse
malware engineers and analysts in the entire industry.
It also has a vast business presence in the Middle East. Slingshot was discovered through
the company’s work in that region.
A source close to Kaspersky Lab told CyberScoop that while some researchers may have
thought Slingshot was the work of a “Five Eyes” nation — a term used to describe an
intelligence alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the
4/6

U.S. — they couldn’t have known for sure. This source told CyberScoop that the Kaspersky
researchers lacked context because there’s “only so much that can be gleaned from
technical evidence.”
Questions sent to the Russian company regarding if they knew about Slingshot’s U.S.
military origin went unanswered.
Even so, a cursory review provides some tips that Slingshot be linked to U.S. spies.
The malware is comprised of individual modules, each carrying a different title, like “Gollum,”
“Cahnadr” or “NeedleWatch,” according to Kaspersky. A leaked NSA memo released in
2015 describes Gollum as a “partner implant” used by another agency aside from NSA. The
memo, circulated between Five Eyes nations, talks about the need to create an accessible
data pipeline that pulls information from infected computers where an active implant is
hidden.
In addition to “Gollum,” the way Slingshot exploits routers made by Latvian company Mikrotik
could perhaps be traced back to another spy agency: the CIA. Classified documents
published by WikiLeaks as part of the so-called “Vault 7” dump show that the CIA has been
interested in compromising Mikrotik equipment since at least 2015. Mikrotik products are
popular in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
Spokespeople for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, NSA and Special
Operations Command (SOCOM) all declined to comment.

Adding fuel to the fire
CyberScoop spoke with several U.S. cybersecurity researchers who said they weren’t
surprised or angered by the fact that Kaspersky had potentially publicized a U.S. cyberespionage operation.
These experts, who asked for anonymity because they feared blowback for speaking
publicly, said that it’s only natural for Kaspersky to attempt to stop cyberattacks aimed at its
clients. Others who spoke to CyberScoop, however, including current U.S. officials, said they
were angry because publicly disclosing Slingshot may put lives in danger.
Complicating the matter is the lawsuit Kaspersky has filed against the U.S. government. The
2018 National Defense Authorization Act banned the use of Kaspersky products across the
federal government. Kaspersky charges that ban is unconstitutional.
The ban comes after numerous reports that the company’s anti-virus engine was leveraged
by Russian spies to remotely pilfer secret U.S. documents on systems where the software
was installed. In response, Kaspersky launched a transparency effort in October 2017, which
it says proves its products are not malicious.

At the moment, it’s not clear if the Russian company expected that its focus on Slingshot
would eventually expose a sensitive U.S. counterterrorism initiative.
A senior U.S. intelligence official claimed that it would be hard to believe that Kaspersky was
totally unaware of what it was handling.
“It’s clear by the way they wrote about this that they knew what it was being used for,” said
the senior official. “GReAT is extremely adept at understanding the information needs of
different actors out there on the internet. They take into considering the geopolitical
circumstances, they’ve shown that time and time again. It would be a stretch for me to
believe they didn’t know what they’re dealing with here.”
