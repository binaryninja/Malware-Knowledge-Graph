How UPS, FedEx, and DHL Phishing Emails Work

May 5, 2020

What happened:
Votiro’s Research Team has discovered a malicious macro that delivers a Dridex trojan
payload hiding in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets delivered via phishing emails appearing to be
from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. The Excel spreadsheet includes an obfuscated macro that
launches PowerShell in hidden mode and downloads the payload from geronaga.com, a
website that is registered with a Chinese website register https://now.cn. The IP address on
this website, at the time when this attack was identified, pointed to a server in Russia.
Upon opening the file, which is a multi-threat document, the user has no insight into the
automatic execution of the macro. The hacker is using a tool called Evil Clippy to hide the
macro from being viewed or analyzed by static analysis tools. Evil Clippy is a cross-platform
assistant for creating malicious Microsoft Office documents. This tool was released during a
BlackHat Asia talk on March 28, 2019.

Once the file is opened, and the user either enables editing or clicks on the link within the
Excel to “View & Pay the Invoice,” it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command that
downloads the payload from a website and executes the attack. This attack is a multi-staged
attack—using a sophisticated technique that evades email protection software and using
advanced tactics that make it look like it came from these UPS, FedEx, and DHL shipping
companies in separate messages.

Who is affected:
People and businesses – even people who are aware of phishing emails – are susceptible to
this email campaign. This email campaign was missed by SaaS email protection providers
because the macro was hidden and the macro was novel and not included in existing
signature databases. As of 2pm ET on May 5th, 2020, VirusTotal reports several email
protection services that would still miss the UPS and FedEx email. This improves the
chances that the attack makes it to business and personal inboxes.
The attacker wanted to make a phishing email appear as if it came from either FedEx, UPS,
or DHL by injecting their servers into the header of the messages. Even a well-trained
person could be fooled by this phishing attack, as it makes the email sender appear to be
legitimate.
If an unsuspecting person received one of these legitimate-looking emails with a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet attached, it is highly likely that they would open the attached Excel
spreadsheet and compromise their systems.

Additional information about each hack:
UPS Phishing Email
A legitimate looking email that appeared to come from the UPS website was sent from
host242-180-static.131-212-b.business.telecomitalia.it, which is an Italian telco. The return
path on the message header points
398094.20200420134554@ZUJOHUR.FODEWOX.njppsagent8.ups.com, which is a UPS
server in Matawan, NJ. Inside this email was a legitimate-looking message from UPS with
the logo and links that lead to ups.com. This email included an Excel spreadsheet that
consists of a macro that automatically executes a PowerShell code, which exploits the user’s
computer.

This attack was identified by Votiro on April 20, 2020 at 8:45am. It was uploaded to
VirusTotal on April 22, 2020 at 5:14pm. A second UPS phishing email was received on April
22, 2020 at 1:42pm. The hash for this is included at the bottom of the post.

This email also included an Excel spreadsheet attachment with an auto-execution macro.
That attachment looked like this.

Every email message received by end-users contains header information. This message
contained server names as if it originated directly from UPS. Even a well-trained person
in cybersecurity could be fooled by this phishing attempt.

FedEx Phishing Email
A legitimate-looking email that appeared to come from Fedex.com was sent from
116.17.62.149, which traces back to Shaping, Guangdong, China. This email was received
by Votiro on April 27, 2020 at 8:45am. The return path on the message header points
sinai25@pvma00009.prod.fedex.com, and this is a server owned by FedEx in Collierville,
Tennessee. Inside this email was a legitimate-looking message from FedEx with the logo and
links pointing to FedEx.
Received: from 116.17.62.149 China IP https://ipinfo.io/116.17.62.149
From: Billing FedEx <BillingOnline@fedex.com>
Return-Path: sinai25@pvma00009.prod.fedex.com

The below Excel was included in the email.

This message contained server names as if it originated directly from FedEx.

DHL Phishing Email
The DHL phishing email was less branded than the other emails. But it is important to note
that the sender appears to be legitimate, with a firstname.lastname@dhl.com email address
appearing to be the sender.
5/8

An individual—who has a name within one letter of the one used as a spoofed DHL email
address—exists on LinkedIn, and their profile lists them as working at DHL. The profile has
very few details. While the profile may not be from the attackers, it helps add legitimacy to
the email, as even though the attacks contain a slightly different spelling of their name, the
single letter difference can be hard to miss.
