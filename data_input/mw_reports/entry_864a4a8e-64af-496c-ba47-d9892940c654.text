New Password-Stealing Malware: BlackGuard
The new malware vows to attempt to steal user data from numerous platforms, such as
Google Chrome, Binance, Microsoft's Outlook, Telegram, and tons more, as per a news
story by Bleeping Computer.
The password-stealing malware primarily harvests sensitive information after cracking open
various accounts on the platforms that it supports.
The news outlet further noted in the same report that the BlackGuard was first seen on
Russian forums way back in January, which back then was still undergoing its testing
phase.
But, this time around, the info-stealing malware is now being sold on numerous online
hacker forums.
In fact, BlackGuard has rapidly grown into popularity-perhaps due to the recent demise of
another malware aptly named the Raccoon Stealer.

BlackGuard vs. Apps
As mentioned, the new password-stealing malware seen in various hacking forums has an
extensive list of apps that it vows to steal data from.
That said, users of top web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi, Microsoft
Edge, and Opera, along with other less popular ones out there, could be affected by the
new malware.
The data-stealing virus will try to steal various data from these browsers, including their
history, autofill, cookies, and saved login credentials.

should also beware of this malware, according to a recent report by ZDNet.
BlackGuard also targets wallet browser extensions, including Metamask, Ronin wallet, and
Binance, to name a few.

On top of that, the password-stealing malware would also attempt to steal the data of
cryptocurrency wallet users, namely, LitecoinCore, AtomicWallet, Electrum, Ethereum,
Exodus, and a lot more.
ZDNet said in the same report that the malware would attempt to harvest the wallet address
and private keys of the users of these crypto platforms.
It attempts to steal data from users of massive VPN apps, such as OpenVPN, ProtonVPN,
and NordVPN.
For email clients, BlackGuard will only attempt to crack the accounts of Outlook users.
However, it is worth noting that the malware also includes the giant gaming platform,
Steam, to its list of targeted apps.
