Indicators of Compromise Associated with
BlackByte Ransomware
SUMMARY
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory was developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) to provide information on BlackByte ransomware. As of
November 2021, BlackByte ransomware had compromised multiple US and foreign
businesses, including entities in at least three US critical infrastructure sectors (government
facilities, financial, and food & agriculture). BlackByte is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)
group that encrypts files on compromised Windows host systems, including physical and
virtual servers.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
The BlackByte executable leaves a ransom note in all directories where encryption occurs.
The ransom note includes the .onion site that contains instructions for paying the ransom and
receiving a decryption key. Some victims reported the actors used a known Microsoft
Exchange Server vulnerability as a means of gaining access to their networks. Once in,
actors deploy tools to move laterally across the network and escalate privileges before
exfiltrating and encrypting files. In some instances, BlackByte ransomware actors have only
partially encrypted files. In cases where decryption is not possible, some data recovery can
occur. Previous versions of BlackByte ransomware downloaded a .png file from IP addresses
185.93.6.31 and 45.9.148.114 prior to encryption. A newer version encrypts without
communicating with any external IP addresses. BlackByte ransomware runs executables
from c:\windows\system32\ and C:\Windows\. Process injection has been observed on
processes it creates.

To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact
your local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices or U.S. Secret Service Field Office at
www.secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices/. When available, please include the following information regarding
the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment
used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact. To
request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at
CISAServiceDesk@cisa.dhs.gov.

activity:
Suspicious files discovered in the following locations:
Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET
Files\root\e22c2559\92c7e946
inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client
Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth
Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current

The filenames for suspicious ASPX files appeared to have the following naming conventions:




<5 random alphabetical characters>.aspx
error<2 capital letters>.aspx
iismeta<4 random numbers>.aspx

Suspicious files were also discovered at:
%AppData%\BB.ico
This file is the icon given to files with a .blackbyte file extension.
%AppData%\BlackByteRestore.txt
This file is the ransom note that is left in every folder where files are encrypted.
%AppData%\dummy
This file is a text file containing a list of machine names that can be reached on the
network.
%HOMEPATH%\complex.exe
This file is the ransomware executable.
Users\tree.dll

Scheduled tasks may be created and artifacts have been observed at
Windows\System32\Tasks:
C:\Users\<username>\complex.exe -single <SHA256>.
This command appears to launch the ransomware.
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c for /l %x in (1,1,75) do start
wordpad.exe /p C:\Users\tree.dll.
This command attempts to open tree.dll in wordpad 75 times and then prints the contents.
IIS logs contain GET and POST requests to various malicious ASPX files that follow a
pattern of "<FILE_PATH>/<SUSPICIOUS_FILENAME>.aspxexec_code=Response.Write"

BlackByte ransomware:

MITIGATIONS

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Implement regular backups of all data to be stored as air gapped, password protected
copies offline. Ensure these copies are not accessible for modification or deletion from
any system where the original data resides.
Implement network segmentation, such that all machines on your network are not
accessible from every other machine.
Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts, and enable real time
detection.
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as
updates/patches are released.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or
unrecognized user accounts.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with
least privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.
Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor
remote access/RDP logs for any unusual activity.
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
Use double authentication when logging into accounts or services.
Ensure routine auditing is conducted for all accounts.
Ensure all the identified IOCs are input into the network SIEM for continuous
monitoring and alerts.

https://www.stopransomware.gov as well as the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing
and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Stopransomware.gov is the
Government’s official one-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more
effectively.
CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment
based on a tiered set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they
are equipped to defend and recover from a ransomware incident.
CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure
organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including
ransomware. By requesting these services, organizations of any size could find ways
to reduce their risk and mitigate attack vectors.
