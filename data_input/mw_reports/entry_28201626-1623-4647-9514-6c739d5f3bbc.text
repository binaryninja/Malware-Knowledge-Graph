In new spear-phishing campaigns observed this month, the Cobalt hacking group targeted
banks in Russia and Romania with emails containing two payloads pointing to two different
command and control servers.

Cobalt is a cybercrime gang that operates since at least 2016 specialized in targeting
financial organizations. According to data from Europol, the group is tied to cyberattacks
against at least 100 banks across the world, stealing about one billion euros from them.
Although the alleged ringleader has been arrested in Spain this year, and three individuals
believed to be members of the hacking crew have been charged at the beginning of the
month, the group continues to operate.

Phishing email uses domain similar to financial organization
Arbor Networks ASERT Team on August 13 noticed a new campaign bearing the Cobalt
signature. The target was NS Bank in Russia. ASERT's threat-intelligence partner Intel471
discovered another campaign aimed at Carpatica Commercial Bank/Patria Bank in
Romania.
The emails delivered to the victims purported to be from other institutions related to the
financial industry, a tactic intended to increase confidence in launching the weaponized files
in the attachment.
The researchers with ASERT examined the domain rietumu[.]me, which is a command and
control (C2) server connected to Cobalt activity, and found an email address that led them
to five new domains created on August 1, one of them being inter-kassa[.]com.
The other domains the experts uncovered, and clearly trying to impersonate financial
institutions are:
compass[.]plus - probably posing as BBVA Compass Bancshares or Compass
Savings Bank
eucentalbank[.]com - probably posing as the European Central Bank
europecentalbank[.]com - probably posing as the European Central Bank
unibank[.]credit - probably posing as any Unibank financial entities across the globe
Interkassa is a legitimate payment processing system based in Georgia (the country)
offering over 50 payment instruments for online transactions in multiple currencies.
Looking for samples associated with this domain, ASERT found a phishing email for an NS
Bank employee. Contrary to the "norm," it included two links to malicious files: one to a
Word document with obfuscated VBA scripts, and one for downloading a binary with the
extension changed to JPG.

Email delivers links to two weaponized files
The weaponized Office file needs to have permission to run macros in order to be able to
execute the VBA script. But if macros are enabled, a convoluted operation is
triggered, ending with downloading and running a JavaScript backdoor very similar in
2/5

functionality with another tool linked to the Cobalt group.

The executable file posing as JPEG image in the email to NS Bank came from hxxp://sepaeuropa[.]eu, a domain pretending to be related to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA),
an initiative for easier cross-border payments within the European Union space.
"UPX unpacked, is an executable rather than an image file. The sample is littered with junk
code that spends CPU cycles before proceeding to de-obfuscate itself. The unpacking
routine involves overwriting itself in memory with another executable," ASERT explains.
Following the analysis of this binary, the researchers determined it was a variant of
CobInt/COOLPANTS - a reconnaissance backdoor found on a C2 operated by Cobalt
hackers in the past.

"Making use of separate infection points in one email with two separate C2s makes this
email peculiar. One could speculate that this would increase the infection odds," ASERT
concludes.

Spear phishing employee at Romanian bank
The spear-phishing campaign against Carpatica Commercial Bank, now merged with Patria
Bank, delivered malware that shared the same program database with a sample from the
domain rietumul[.]me, tied to the Cobalt group.

The header of the phishing email shows that the attacker used SEPA once more as a cover
for the malicious activity, using SEPA Europe as the sender of the message.

It is unclear when Intel471 caught the phishing email, but two weeks ago the Romanian
Intelligence Service (SRI) announced that it had solid information about cyberattacks aimed
at financial institutions in Romania.
According to the communication, the events occurred between June and August, a
timeframe that overlaps with the campaigns discovered by the researchers at the two
companies.
SRI says that analysis from its cyberintelligence unit, National Cyberint Center (CNC),
shows that the arsenal of attack tools used by the hackers includes Cobalt Strike, a piece of
software for penetration testing. This is confirmed by the numerous reports from various
security companies that examined the group's activity.

Phishing is how it starts
Spear-phishing is an initial stage of the attack, where the group tries to gain a foothold
access in the bank's digital infrastructure. Subsequent activity from the Cobalt group
typically consists in reconnaissance and moving laterally inside the network.
After they learn how the target operates and get the same access as high-level employees,
the hackers could execute money transfers, command ATMs, and steal money from
payment gateways and SWIFT systems.
