An affiliate of the recently discovered Yanluowang ransomware operation is focusing its
attacks on U.S. organizations in the financial sector using BazarLoader malware in the
reconnaissance stage.
Based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures, the threat actor is experienced
with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations and may be linked with the Fivehands
group.

Fivehands ransomware connection
Researchers at Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software, note that the actor has been
hitting higher-profile targets in the U.S. since at least August.

While its interest is in financial institutions, the Yanluowang ransomware affiliate has also
targeted companies in the manufacturing, IT services, consultancy, and engineering
sectors.
Looking at the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the researchers noticed a
possible connection to older attacks with the Thieflock, a ransomware operation developed
by the Fivehands group.
Fivehands ransomware itself is relatively new on the scene, becoming known in April - first
in a report from Mandiant, who is tracking its developer as UNC2447, and then in an alert
from CISA.
At the time, Mandiant said that UNC2447 showed “advanced capabilities to evade detection
and minimize post-intrusion forensics,” and that its affiliates had been deploying
RagnarLocker ransomware.
Symantec notes that the link found between recent Yanluowang attacks and older ones with
Thieflock is tentative, as it relies on several TTPs found in Fivehands ransomware attacks,
such as:
the use of custom password recovery tools and open-source ones (e.g. GrabFF)
using open-source network scanning tools (e.g. SoftPerfect Network Scanner)
using the S3 Browser and Cent browser to upload and download data
“This link begs the question of whether Yanluowang was developed by Canthroid [a.k.a.
Fivehands]. However, analysis of Yanluowang and Thieflock does not provide any evidence
of shared authorship. Instead, the most likely hypothesis is that these Yanluowang attacks
may be carried out by a former Thieflock affiliate,” the researchers say.

Tools of the trade
After gaining access to the target network, the attacker uses PowerShell to download tools,
such as the BazarLoader malware to help with moving laterally.
BazarLoader is delivered to corporate targets by the TrickBot botnet, which also
spreads Conti ransomware. More recently, TrickBot operators started to help rebuilding the
Emotet botnet.
The Yanluowang threat actor enables the remote desktop service (RDP) from the registry
and installs the ConnectWise tool for remote access.
The researchers say that the affiliate discovers systems of interest with the AdFind tool - to
query the Active Directory, and SoftPerfect Network Scanner - to find hostnames and
network services.

Several tools are used to steal credentials from the browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Internet
Explorer) of compromised machines: GrabFF, GrabChrome, BrowserPassView.
Symantec’s researchers also noticed that the attacker used KeeThief to steal the master
key for the KeePass password manager, a screen capture tool, and the data exfiltration
utility Filegrab.
In a previous report about Yanluowang attacks, the company said that the hackers
threatened with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and data wiping attacks if the victim did
not comply with the demands.
Today's report on the Yanluowang affiliate includes indicators of compromise for the tools
and malware used in the attack.
