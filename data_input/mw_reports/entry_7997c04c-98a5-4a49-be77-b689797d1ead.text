This comprehensive report details APT41, a prolific Chinese cyber threat group that carries
out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated operations.
APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware
typically reserved for espionage campaigns in what appears to be activity for personal gain.
Explicit financially-motivated targeting is unusual among Chinese state-sponsored threat
groups, and evidence suggests APT41 has conducted simultaneous cyber crime and cyber
espionage operations from 2014 onward.
