Norway's parliament, the Storting, has suffered another cyberattack after threat actors stole
data using the recently disclosed Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.
Last week, Microsoft released emergency security updates for Microsoft Exchange to fix
zero-day vulnerabilities, known as ProxyLogon, used in attacks.
These attacks were originally attributed to a China state-sponsored hacking group known
as HAFNIUM who used the vulnerabilities to compromise servers, install backdoor web
shells, and gain access to internal corporate networks.

Soon after suffering a cyberattack in December, the Storting today announced a new
cyberattack linked to the recent Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.
"The Storting has again been hit by an IT attack. The attack is linked to vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Exchange, which affected several businesses.
"The Storting does not yet know the full extent of the attack. A number of measures have
been implemented in our systems, and the analysis work is ongoing. The Storting has
received confirmation that data has been extracted," the Storting disclosed in a statement.
At this time, the Storting has confirmed that the threat actors have stolen data as part of the
cyberattack but are still investigating.
"We know that data has been extracted, but we do not yet have a full overview of the
situation. We have implemented comprehensive measures and cannot rule out that it will be
implemented further."
"The work takes place in collaboration with the security authorities. The situation is currently
unclear, and we do not know the full potential for damage," says Storting director Marianne
Andreassen.
However, they do not believe this attack is related to their cyberattack in December 2020,
attributed to the Russian APT 28 state-sponsored hacking group.
While Microsoft initially attributed the recent Microsoft Exchange server attacks on a
Chinese hacking group known as Hafnium, we have later learned that other hacking groups
had been using them as well.
According to a new report by cybersecurity firm ESET, in addition to Hafnium, other
cybercrime groups known as Tick, LuckyMouse, and Calypso had also been exploiting the
zero-day vulnerabilities before the patches were released.
In a new report released today, ESET states that even more hacking groups are jumping
into the Microsoft Exchange frenzy as they rush to hack systems before they are patched.
