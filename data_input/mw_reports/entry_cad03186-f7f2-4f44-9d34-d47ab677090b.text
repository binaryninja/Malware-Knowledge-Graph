Egregor ransomware: Maze’s heir apparent

In September, a new ransomware brand emerged just as the Maze ransomware gang began
shuttering its operation. Named Egregor (from an occult term derived from the Greek word
ἑγρήγορος, “wakeful”—a term used to refer to an angel-like spirit or group mind), the
ransomware leverages data stolen during the attack to extort the victim for payment,
following a trail blazed by Maze.
Egregor’s ransom note tells its victims “soon mass media, your partners and clients WILL
KNOW about your PROBLEM…If you do not contact us in the next 3 DAYS we will begin
DATA publication.”
Like Maze, Egregor uses the ChaCha and RSA encryption algorithms to encrypt victims’
files. Also like Maze, Egregor is suspected to be a ransomware-as-a-service operation—
dependent on affiliates who receive payment for dropping the malware on victims’ networks.
But Egregor’s code is not a derivative of the malware used by Maze; rather, it is a variant of a
ransomware family known as Sekhmet. Sekhmet’s operators started publishing data from
victims in March 2020, but their “Sekhmet Leaks” website is no longer accessible, and only
six victims were publicly exposed by the ring before the site went down—which coincided
with the launch of the Egregor site. It’s not clear if the creators of Egregor and Sekhmet are
the same, but Egregor’s ransomware is clearly derived from the Sekhmet malware.

We first detected Egregor in September during an attack against a customer. As of
November 25, the ring has posted details on over 130 victims on its Tor hidden services
(.onion) website. The alleged victims of these attacks are diverse, both in terms of location
and organization type—they include schools, manufacturers, logistics organizations, financial
institutions, and technology companies. The Egregor gang specifically called out two gaming
companies—Crytek and Ubisoft—in a “press release” in October.

The Egregor website, a Tor hidden service, includes “release notes,” or press releases, on
high-profile victims. The game developers Crytek and Ubisoft were reportedly hit by Egregor
in October.

The Egregor “Hall of Shame” is a listing of victims who failed to pay the demanded ransom
for data , with links to .zip compressed folders of data stolen from them. The Egregor
operators claim to sell stolen data that they do not publish publicly.

The spirit descends
Commodity malware is the vehicle most commonly associated with Egregor. Some of the
attacks we’ve tracked were linked with Qbot malware activity, though it was not clear how
long Qbot had been present on the victims’ networks. Qbot (also known as Qakbot) deploys
from a malicious document file attached to an e-mail message. Earlier this year, ZDNet
reported that Qbot’s operators engaged in “thread hijacking,” sending the maldocs as replies
to ongoing email threads in order to dupe targets into opening the malicious attachments.
Egregor has no way to spread itself, so it requires the attackers to move laterally themselves,
using built-in Windows capabilities and other exploitation tools. In some cases, Cobalt Strike
exploitation tools have been detected as part of Egregor attacks. The attacker(s) used these

tools to execute scripts, gather information about other systems on the network, extract
additional credentials, and spread the ransomware. In one case, the Cobalt Strike agent was
used to create an RDP connection to other machines on the targeted network, and copy the
Egregor executable to them—copying the files to the directory C:\perflogs.
In the same attack, another malware called SystemBC—a Tor network proxy—was used to
create an obfuscated backchannel for data exfiltration and attack communications. The use
of Cobalt Strike, SystemBC and the C:\perflogs directory in this case match the behavior
seen in a Ryuk attack we investigated in September 2020. (We’ve also seen Cobalt Strike
tools used in connection with earlier Sekhmet attacks.)
After exfiltrating data, the attackers launch the ransomware. The approach to launching the
ransomware varied across the incidents we examined; in some cases, it was launched by a
script, and in others it was configured as a scheduled Windows task.
As with Sekhmet, the Egregor ransomware itself is not an executable, but a dynamic link
library (DLL) that is executed using Windows’ rundll32.exe utility. To evade sandbox
detection, the DLL will only execute when given a password as a command line parameter,
along with a flag for the type of the attack to be executed. We’ve seen three different
passwords used in attacks we investigated, in addition to other parameters:
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\sed.dll,DllRegisterServer -passegregor1313 --full
rundll32.exe /i C:\WINDOWS\b.dll DllRegisterServer -passegregor9999 --full --fast=256
rundll32.exe C:\perflogs\clang.dll,DllRegisterServer -peguard6

The DLL is a two-stage package. The first stage is an unpacker that verifies the password is
correct by checking against its SHA256 value. The second stage is the actual decrypted
ransomware DLL, which contains the ransom note format, along with a hardcoded RSA key
and list of files and process names to kill or terminate. There’s also a number of “spaghetti”
functions included for the purpose of deterring analysis of the code.

Paying the piper
Once Egregor executes, it encrypts a wide variety of data files, including images, videos,
documents, SQL and other database-related files, Web pages, JavaScript files, and
executables. Encrypted files have their names appended with an extension made up of
random characters. As with Sekhmet, the ransomware drops a ransom demand in a text file
named RECOVER-FILES.txt:

A

redacted Egregor ransom note. A text block at the end of the message identifies the victim to
the Egregor actors.
The “special technical block” at the end of the ransom note is unique to the victim. Following
the note’s instructions to connect via a Tor browser or via a public internet to the Egregor
web portal, which instructs victims to upload their RECOVER-FILES.txt file.

From there, victims can engage with Egregor’s “customer service” organization to receive the
ransom demand and negotiate payment.

More of the same
The use of crafted spam messages with malicious attachments, commodity malware and
exploitation tools, and exfiltration of data for extortion purposes have become common
tactics as ransomware developers have shifted to an “as-a-service” model. These threats
require a defense in depth to prevent theft and encryption of data, including educating
employees on the tactics that might trick them into executing the malware that gives
ransomware attackers their foothold on the network.

6/7

Given that the group behind Egregor claims to sell stolen data if ransoms are not paid, it’s
not enough to have good backups of organizational data as a mitigation for ransomware.
Organizations need to assume that their data has been breached if they suffer an Egregor
(or any other ransomware) attack. Blocking common exfiltration routes for data—such as
preventing Tor connections—can make stealing data more difficult, but the best defense is to
deny attackers access through email attachment malware and other common entry points.
Malware protection throughout the organization can help prevent commodity malware
attacks such as Qbot, and lateral spread through tools such as Cobalt Strike. (Sophos
detects Egregor in multiple ways, and also detects Cobalt Strike and Qbot, as noted in the
indicators of compromise posted on SophosLabs’ GitHub.)
