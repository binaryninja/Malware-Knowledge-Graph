Whole Networks
guardicore.com/labs/smb-worm-indexsinas/

Executive Summary
Guardicore reveals new details in the Indexsinas SMB worm, also dubbed
NSABuffMiner.
The attack campaign has been active since 2019 and is still under operation and
maintenance today.
Targeted devices are SMB servers vulnerable to EternalBlue (MS17-010). According to
Shodan, there are more than 1.2 million internet-facing SMB servers today.
The attack makes vast use of the Equation Group exploit kit, which includes
EternalBlue exploit as well as the DoublePulsar backdoor.
Victims include organizations in the healthcare, hospitality, education and
telecommunications sectors.
Guardicore Labs published a Github repository with all IOCs for this campaign as well as a
detection tool in Powershell.
Guardicore Labs exposes new details of a massive attack campaign dubbed Indexsinas
(also known as “NSABuffMiner”) which breaches networks through SMB servers and makes
aggressive use of lateral movement to propagate. The attack campaign targets Windows
servers vulnerable to EternalBlue (MS17-010) and still infects machines worldwide.

Propagation is achieved through the combination of an open source port scanner and three
Equation Group exploits – EternalBlue, DoublePulsar and EternalRomance. These exploits
are used to breach new victim machines, obtain privileged access, and install backdoors.
These exploits appear to still be highly successful despite being made public four years ago
after their first occurrence in the WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks. Indexsinas proves
that networks today are vulnerable to even non-targeted, opportunistic attack campaigns.

Attack Scope
The Indexsinas campaign started attacking Guardicore Global Sensors Network (GGSN) at
the beginning of 2019 and is still active today. Guardicore’s sensors have recorded over
2,000 attacks since we began tracking the campaign.

The attacks originated from over 1,300 different sources, with each machine responsible for
only a few attack incidents. Source IPs – which are likely to be victims of the attacks
themselves – are mostly located in the U.S., Vietnam and India. Analysis of these IPs
demonstrate that various sectors were infected by Indexsinas including hotels, universities,
medical centers, government agencies and telecommunication companies.

The Indexsinas attackers are careful and calculated. The campaign has been running for
years with the same command-and-control domain, hosted in South Korea. The C2 server is
highly protected, patched and exposes no redundant ports to the internet. The attackers use
a private mining pool for their cryptomining operations, which prevents anyone from
accessing their wallets’ statistics.

Attack Flow
The attack flow consists of many batch scripts, executable payloads, downloaders, services
and scheduled tasks. A prominent characteristic of the campaign is its competitiveness; it
terminates processes related to other attack campaigns, deletes their file system residues
and stops services created by other attack groups. It also attempts to evade detection by
killing programs related to process monitoring and analysis. In addition, it makes sure to
delete its own files immediately after execution.

Breach and the 1st Stage Downloader
The attack begins when a machine is breached through RPC or SMB servers, using the
NSA’s exploitation tools. These exploits run code in the victim’s kernel and are capable of
injecting payloads to user-mode processes using asynchronous procedure calls (APCs).
Indexsinas uses the exploits to inject code to either explorer.exe or lsass.exe. The injected
payloads – EternalBlue.dll for 32-bit and DoublePulsar.dll for 64-bit – download three
executable files from the main C2 server, as detailed in the table below.

Persistence, Remote Access & C2 Reporting [86.exe, 64.exe]
The 86.exe and 64.exe files contain a whole, reversed DLL, a Portable Executable file turned
upside down, with “ZM” at the end (instead of “MZ” at the beginning). This DLL is a remote
access tool (RAT), a version of Gh0stCringe. It is dropped to a random path and loaded into
memory. Then, two of its exported functions are called – Install and MainThread. The first
installs the RAT by creating a service under svchost, namely, it creates a registry key for the
new service with svchost.exe as its executable and uses the path to the DLL as the
ServiceDLL parameter. The second function performs the core functionality. It waits for
commands from the C2 and reports machine information to it – computer name, malware
group ID, installation date and CPU technical specs. The tool has various capabilities; it can
download and execute additional modules, install them as services, and interact with the
user by opening message boxes and presenting URLs in Internet Explorer.

Cryptominer [iexplore.exe, services.exe]
The iexplore.exe and services.exe files install two services using a tool masqueraded as
svchost.exe. The first service – MicrosotMaims – is responsible for dropping a cryptominer
through an additional file named conhost.exe.

Guardicore Centra shows the creation of a new service MicrosotMais
The second – MicrosotMaim – simply runs the cryptominer module. The miner process is
named d1lhots.exe; it is compiled from XMRig, mines Monero and is executed via the
command line below.
d1lhots -o stratum+tcp://a.ccmd.website:1188 -u Bing1 -k –max-cpu-usage=50 –donatelevel=1 -r3 –asm=AUTO –print-time=3 –nicehash

iexplore.exe drops two additional scripts. The first – chosts.bat – is a batch script which
modifies the local firewall rules using ipsec and blocks any incoming traffic to SMB and RPC
ports (135, 137, 138, 139 and 445). The second script – tem.vbs – is used to delete both
iexplore.exe and itself.

Propagation [c64.exe]
Another payload which is downloaded as part of the 1st stage is c64.exe, which in turn drops
two files. The first is xfsxdel~.exe and is only used to delete c64.exe from disk. The second is
ctfmon.exe – the propagation tool.
ctfmon.exe is responsible for finding potential victims and exploiting them using Equation
Group’s tools – and it does that extremely thoroughly. It uses exploits for both 32-bit and 64bit machines and scans both RPC (TCP 139) and SMB (TCP 445) ports. Moreover, it tries to
move laterally within the organizational network as well as spread across the internet.
ctfmon.exe executes a batch script same.bat. This script initiates two flows: one for lateral
movement within the network, and the other for spreading on the internet. The two flows are
similar in their sequence: A daily scheduled task runs a batch script, which installs a service.
The service runs another batch script which performs the port scanning and exploitation. The
batch scripts in these flows also uninstall competitors’ services, terminate their processes
and delete their files. In addition, they clean old Indexsinas traces.

General Propagation Scheme
1. Lateral Movement. The scheduled task At2 runs daily. It executes a batch script –
wai.bat – which installs a service called MicrosoftMssql. The service runs bat.bat,
which scans known private IP ranges.
2. Internet Worm. The scheduled task At1 runs daily. It executes a batch script – nei.bat
– which installs a service called MicrosoftMysql. The service runs cmd.bat, which
scans the class C subnet of the victim’s public IP address.
Indexsinas makes use of an open-source port scanner called s that is compiled into an
executable file titled taskhost.exe. The scanner outputs a list of servers whose SMB ports
are open in a file called Results.txt. Then, each IP in that list is attacked using Equation
Group’s exploits.
Upon successful exploitation, DoublePulsar.dll (for 64-bit) or EternalBlue.dll (for 32-bit) are
injected into the victim machine’s kernel and the attack flow starts all over again on the
newly-infected machine.

Detection and Prevention
Detection
Guardicore Labs publishes a detection tool in PowerShell which identifies malicious
indicators of compromise on a Windows machine. Execute this script from a command line
prompt to see whether the system is infected or not. Detailed instructions can be found in
Guardicore Labs’ Github repository.

Prevention with Visibility and Segmentation
Indexsinas and other attack campaigns leverage vulnerable SMB servers to breach networks
and move laterally inside them. There are more than 1 million SMB servers accessible to
anyone on the internet, and many of them still vulnerable to MS-17010; this is exactly what
makes Indexsinas and similar attack campaigns profitable.
The keys to recognizing vulnerable entry points with your organization and preventing
attacks from propagating within the network are visibility and segmentation.

It is crucial that network administrators, IT teams and security personnel be able to easily
identify assets and the services they run. Specifically, it should be easy to spot internetfacing servers, SMB included.

receive
With visibility in place, network admins would want to limit the access from and to different
assets and the network services they expose.
The following are examples of policy rules which can protect your organization’s SMB
servers:
Access from the internet over SMB is not allowed, except from certain authorized IP
addresses to a file server in the DMZ

Guardicore Centra rule to allow only certain IP addresses to access internet-facing file
servers in the organization
SMB traffic inside the network is blocked, except for Domain Controllers and SMB file
servers

Guardicore Centra rule to allow SMB traffic inside the network only to file servers and domain

The threat of lateral movement is as worrying as the threat of
ransomware
On June 2nd, the U.S. White House sent an open letter to corporate executives and
business leaders in the private sector, urging them to take action and defend their
organizations from ransomware. One paragraph stands out in this memo as it addresses the
data center’s network itself, clearly stating the importance of segmenting corporate networks.
Network segmentation not only prevents an attacker from moving laterally and reaching
strategic assets and crown jewels in the network; it also helps minimize damage (reduce the
blast radius) by creating boundaries between servers in the network and limiting the network
traffic between them.
Segment your networks: There’s been a recent shift in ransomware attacks – from
stealing data to disrupting operations. It’s critically important that your corporate business
functions and manufacturing/production operations are separated and that you carefully
filter and limit internet access to operational networks, identify links between these
networks and develop workarounds or manual controls to ensure ICS networks can be
isolated and continue operating if your corporate network is compromised. Regularly test
contingency plans such as manual controls so that safety critical functions can be
maintained during a cyber incident.

But don’t be misled by the title mentioning only the “threat of ransomware”. Lateral
movement inside a compromised network can be used to drop any type of payload – be it
ransomware, remote access tools, backdoors and cryptominers. Lateral movement is the
real threat whereas ransomware is only one motive implementing it. In the case of
Indexsinas, lateral movement is used to infect as many machines as possible with a remote
access tool and a cryptominer. Network segmentation is crucial in preventing such
campaigns from spreading and disrupting business operations.
