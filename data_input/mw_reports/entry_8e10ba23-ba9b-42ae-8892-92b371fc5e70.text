Pretending to be the Permanent Mission of Norway, the Emotet operators performed a
targeted phishing attack against email addresses associated with users at the United
Nations.
Yesterday, the Emotet trojan roared back to life after a 3-week vacation with strong spam
campaigns that targeted countries throughout the world.
While Emotet's normal spam campaigns pretended to be fake accounting reports, delivery
notices, and invoices, the malware operators had something special in mind for the United
Nations.

Impersonating the "Permanent Mission of Norway"
In a sample of a phishing email shared with BleepingComputer by email security firm
Cofense, the Emotet operators pretend to be representatives of Norway at the United
Nations in New York, who state that there is a problem with an attached signed agreement.
According to Cofense, this phishing campaign had "highly specific targeting" and was seen
being sent to 600 unique email addresses at the United Nations.

The email states that the representatives of Norway found a problem with a signed
agreement and that the recipient should review it to learn the issue.

Emotet spam targeting the United Nations
The full text of this targeted phishing email can be read below:
Hi,
Please be advised that the new problem has been appeared today.
See below our info for this question.
Please let me know if you need anything else.
Regards
Permanent Mission of Norway to the United Nations in New York

Attached to these emails is a Microsoft Word document that starts with "Doc_01_13" that
pretends to be the signed agreement being sent by the Permanent Mission of Norway.
While there was room for Emotet to send a more convincing Word document template, they
instead sent the same one that is used for all of the malspam campaigns.

2/4

This template pretends to be a warning that the "document only available for desktop or
laptop versions of Microsoft Office Word." It then prompts the user to click on 'Enable editing'
or 'Enable Content' to view the document.

Malicious Email Attachment
If a user opens the document and enables its content, malicious Word macros will be
executed that downloads and installs Emotet on the computer.
Emotet will now run in the background while sending out spam emails to other victims.
Eventually, Emotet will also install other payloads such as Trickbot, which would be when
things get really bad for the compromised UN workstation.

Emotet can lead to a full network compromise
When Emotet is installed on a machine, one of the malware payloads that is invariably
installed is the TrickBot trojan.
The TrickBot trojan will attempt to harvest data from the computer such as cookies, login
credentials, files from the computer, and possibly spread to other computers on the network.
After the harvesting of information is finished, TrickBot is known to open a reverse shell back
to the operators of Ryuk Ransomware.

3/4

These operators will proceed to infiltrate the network, gain administrator credentials, and
ultimately deploy Ryuk so that it encrypts every device on the network.
This is particularly worrisome for a UN network as ransomware operators are known to steal
data before encrypting files, which could expose extremely sensitive diplomatic or
government information.
While there are no known victims of this phishing attack, this targeted attack illustrates that
bad actors are constantly trying to get access to the networks of organizations and
government networks.
This is why it is imperative for all employees regardless of what sector they work in to be
properly trained on how to recognize phishing emails.
Furthermore, before opening any attachments and enabling macros, users should notify their
network administrator and contact the alleged user who sent the email to confirm its
authenticity.
BleepingComputer has contacted the Permanent Mission of Norway about this attack but
has not heard back at this time.
