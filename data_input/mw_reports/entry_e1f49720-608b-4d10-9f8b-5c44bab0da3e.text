1/19

Reconnaissance

T1595.001 – Active
Scanning – Scanning
IP Blocks:
Adversaries may scan
victim IP blocks to
gather information
that can be used
during targeting.
Public IP addresses
may be allocated to
organizations by
block, or a range of
sequential addresses.

M1056 – Precompromise:
This technique cannot
be easily mitigated
with preventive
controls since it is
based on behaviors
performed outside of
the scope of
enterprise defenses
and controls. Efforts
should focus on
minimizing the
amount and sensitivity
of data available to
external parties.

M1056 – Precompromise:
This technique cannot
be easily mitigated
with preventive
controls since it is
based on behaviors
performed outside of
the scope of
enterprise defenses
and controls. Efforts
should focus on
minimizing the
amount and sensitivity
of data available to
external parties.

Adversaries may
hijack domains and/or
subdomains that can
be used during
targeting. Domain
registration hijacking
is the act of changing
the registration of a
domain name without
the permission of the
original registrant.
Initial Access

T1190 – Exploit
Public-Facing
Application:
Adversaries may
attempt to take
advantage of a
weakness in an
Internet-facing
computer or program
using software, data,
or commands in order
to cause unintended
or unanticipated
behavior. The
weakness in the
system can be a bug,
a glitch, or a design
vulnerability.

M1048 - Application
Isolation and
Sandboxing:
Application isolation
will limit what other
processes and
system features the
exploited target can
access.

2/19

M1050 - Exploit Protection:
Web Application Firewalls may be used to limit
exposure of applications to prevent exploit traffic
from reaching the application.
M1030 - Network Segmentation:
Segment externally facing servers and services
from the rest of the network with a DMZ or on
separate hosting infrastructure.
M1026 - Privileged Account Management:
Use least privilege for service accounts will limit
what permissions the exploited process gets on the
rest of the system.
M1051 – Update Software:
Update software regularly by employing patch
management for externally exposed applications.
M1016 – Vulnerability Scanning:
Regularly scan externally facing systems for
vulnerabilities and establish procedures to rapidly
patch systems when critical vulnerabilities are
discovered through scanning and through public
disclosure.
T1133 – External Remote Services:
Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote
services to initially access and/or persist within a
network.

M1042 - Disable or
Remove Feature or
Program:
Disable or block
remotely available
services that may be
unnecessary.

M1035 - Limit Access to Resource Over Network:
Limit access to remote services through centrally
managed concentrators such as VPNs and other
managed remote access systems.

3/19

M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication:
Use strong two-factor or multi-factor authentication
for remote service accounts to mitigate an
adversary's ability to leverage stolen credentials,
but be aware of Two-Factor Authentication
Interception techniques for some two-factor
authentication implementations.
M1030 - Network Segmentation:
Deny direct remote access to internal systems
through the use of network proxies, gateways, and
firewalls.
T1566 – Phishing:
Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain
access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are
electronically delivered social engineering.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Anti-virus can
automatically
quarantine suspicious
files.

M1031 - Network Intrusion Prevention:
Network intrusion prevention systems and systems
designed to scan and remove malicious email
attachments or links can be used to block activity.
M1021 - Restrict Web-Based Content:
Determine if certain websites or attachment types
(ex: .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl, etc.) that can be used for
phishing are necessary for business operations and
consider blocking access if activity cannot be
monitored well or if it poses a significant risk.
M1054 - Software Configuration:
Use anti-spoofing and email authentication
mechanisms to filter messages based on validity
checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and
integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these
mechanisms within an organization (through
policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients
(intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar
message filtering and validation.[3][4]

4/19

M1017 - User Training:
Users can be trained to identify social engineering
techniques and phishing emails.
T1078 – Valid Accounts:
Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of
existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial
Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or
Defense Evasion.

M1013 - Application
Developer Guidance:
Ensure that
applications do not
store sensitive data or
credentials insecurely.
(e.g. plaintext
credentials in code,
published credentials
in repositories, or
credentials in public
cloud storage).

M1027 - Password Policies:
Applications and appliances that utilize default
username and password should be changed
immediately after the installation, and before
deployment to a production environment. When
possible, applications that use SSH keys should be
updated periodically and properly secured.
M1026 - Privileged Account Management:
Audit domain and local accounts as well as their
permission levels routinely to look for situations that
could allow an adversary to gain wide access by
obtaining credentials of a privileged account. These
audits should also include if default accounts have
been enabled, or if new local accounts are created
that have not be authorized. Follow best practices
for design and administration of an enterprise
network to limit privileged account use across
administrative tiers.
M1017 - User Training:
Applications may send push notifications to verify a
login as a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Train users to only accept valid push notifications
and to report suspicious push notifications.

5/19

Execution

T1059.001 –
Command and
Scripting Interpreter –
PowerShell:
Adversaries may
abuse PowerShell
commands and
scripts for execution.
PowerShell is a
powerful interactive
command-line
interface and scripting
environment included
in the Windows
operating system.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Anti-virus can be used
to automatically
quarantine suspicious
files.

M1045 - Code Signing:
Set PowerShell execution policy to execute only
signed scripts.
M1042 - Disable or Remove Feature or Program:
It may be possible to remove PowerShell from
systems when not needed, but a review should be
performed to assess the impact to an environment,
since it could be in use for many legitimate
purposes and administrative functions.
Disable/restrict the WinRM Service to help prevent
uses of PowerShell for remote execution.
M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control where appropriate.
M1026 - Privileged Account Management:
When PowerShell is necessary, restrict PowerShell
execution policy to administrators. Be aware that
there are methods of bypassing the PowerShell
execution policy, depending on environment
configuration.
T1059.003 – Windows Command Shell:
Adversaries may abuse the Windows command
shell for execution. The Windows command shell
(cmd) is the primary command prompt on Windows
systems.

M1038 - Execution
Prevention:
Use application
control where
appropriate.

6/19

T1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation:
Adversaries may abuse Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious
commands and payloads. WMI is an administration
feature that provides a uniform environment to
access Windows system components.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint:
On Windows 10,
enable Attack Surface
Reduction (ASR)
rules to block
processes created by
WMI commands from
running. Note: many
legitimate tools and
applications utilize
WMI for command
execution.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control configured to block
execution of wmic.exe if it is not required for a
given system or network to prevent potential
misuse by adversaries. For example, in Windows
10 and Windows Server 2016 and above, Windows
Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy rules
may be applied to block the wmic.exe application
and to prevent abuse.
M1026 - Privileged Account Management:
Prevent credential overlap across systems of
administrator and privileged accounts.
M1018 - User Account Management:
By default, only administrators are allowed to
connect remotely using WMI. Restrict other users
who are allowed to connect, or disallow all users to
connect remotely to WMI.

7/19

Persistence

T1547.001 – Boot or
Logon Autostart
Execution: Registry
Run Keys / Startup
Folder:
Adversaries may
achieve persistence
by adding a program
to a startup folder or
referencing it with a
Registry run key.
Adding an entry to the
"run keys" in the
Registry or startup
folder will cause the
program referenced to
be executed when a
user logs in.

T1574.001 – Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search
Order Hijacking:
Adversaries may execute their own malicious
payloads by hijacking the search order used to load
DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to
look for required DLLs to load into a program.
Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of
establishing persistence as well as elevating
privileges and/or evading restrictions on file
execution.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

M1047 – Audit:
Use auditing tools
capable of detecting
DLL search order
hijacking opportunities
on systems within an
enterprise and correct
them. Toolkits like the
PowerSploit
framework contain
PowerUp modules
that can be used to
explore systems for
DLL hijacking
weaknesses.
Use the program
sxstrace.exe that is
included with
Windows along with
manual inspection to
check manifest files
for side-by-side
problems in software.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Adversaries may use new DLLs to execute this
technique. Identify and block potentially malicious
software executed through search order hijacking
by using application control solutions capable of
blocking DLLs loaded by legitimate software.

8/19

M1044 - Restrict Library Loading:
Disallow loading of remote DLLs. This is included
by default in Windows Server 2012+ and is
available by patch for XP+ and Server 2003+.
Enable Safe DLL Search Mode to force search for
system DLLs in directories with greater restrictions
(e.g. %SYSTEMROOT%)to be used before local
directory DLLs (e.g. a user's home directory)
The Safe DLL Search Mode can be enabled via
Group Policy at Computer Configuration > [Policies]
> Administrative Templates > MSS (Legacy): MSS:
(SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search
mode. The associated Windows Registry key for
this is located at
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
Manager\SafeDLLSearchMode

9/19

Privilege Escalation

T1134 – Access
Token Manipulation:
Adversaries may
modify access tokens
to operate under a
different user or
system security
context to perform
actions and bypass
access controls.
Windows uses access
tokens to determine
the ownership of a
running process. A
user can manipulate
access tokens to
make a running
process appear as
though it is the child
of a different process
or belongs to
someone other than
the user that started
the process. When
this occurs, the
process also takes on
the security context
associated with the
new token.

M1026 - Privileged
Account
Management:
Limit permissions so
that users and user
groups cannot create
tokens. This setting
should be defined for
the local system
account only. GPO:
Computer
Configuration >
[Policies] > Windows
Settings > Security
Settings > Local
Policies > User Rights
Assignment: Create a
token object. Also
define who can create
a process level token
to only the local and
network service
through GPO:
Computer
Configuration >
[Policies] > Windows
Settings > Security
Settings > Local
Policies > User Rights
Assignment: Replace
a process level token.
Administrators should
log in as a standard
user but run their
tools with
administrator
privileges using the
built-in access token
manipulation
command runas.

M1018 - User Account Management:
An adversary must already have administrator level
access on the local system to make full use of this
technique; be sure to restrict users and accounts to
the least privileges they require.

10/19

T1484.001 – Domain Policy Modification: Group
Policy Modification:
Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects
(GPOs) to subvert the intended discretionary
access controls for a domain, usually with the
intention of escalating privileges on the domain.
Group policy allows for centralized management of
user and computer settings in Active Directory
(AD).

M1047 – Audit:
Identify and correct
GPO permissions
abuse opportunities
(ex: GPO modification
privileges) using
auditing tools such as
BloodHound (version
1.5.1 and later).

M1018 – User Account Management:
Consider implementing WMI and security filtering to
further tailor which users and computers a GPO will
apply to.
T1548.002 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:
Bypass User Account Control:
Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to
elevate process privileges on system. Windows
User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to
elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels
ranging from low to high) to perform a task under
administrator-level permissions, possibly by
prompting the user for confirmation.

M1047 – Audit:
Check for common
UAC bypass
weaknesses on
Windows systems to
be aware of the risk
posture and address
issues where
appropriate.

M1026 - Privileged Account Management:
Remove users from the local administrator group
on systems.
M1051 – Update Software:
Consider updating Windows to the latest version
and patch level to utilize the latest protective
measures against UAC bypass.
M1052 - User Account Control:
Although UAC bypass techniques exist, it is still
prudent to use the highest enforcement level for
UAC when possible and mitigate bypass
opportunities that exist with techniques such as
DLL Search Order Hijacking.

11/19

Defense Evasion

T1484.001 – Domain
Policy Modification:
Group Policy
Modification:
Adversaries may
modify Group Policy
Objects (GPOs) to
subvert the intended
discretionary access
controls for a domain,
usually with the
intention of escalating
privileges on the
domain. Group policy
allows for centralized
management of user
and computer settings
in Active Directory
(AD).

M1047 – Audit:
Identify and correct
GPO permissions
abuse opportunities
(ex: GPO modification
privileges) using
auditing tools such as
BloodHound (version
1.5.1 and later).

M1018 – User Account Management:
Consider implementing WMI and security filtering to
further tailor which users and computers a GPO will
apply to.
T1027.002 – Obfuscated Files or Information:
Software Packing:

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:

Adversaries may perform software packing or
virtual machine software protection to conceal their
code. Software packing is a method of
compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing
an executable changes the file signature in an
attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most
decompression techniques decompress the
executable code in memory.

Employ heuristicbased malware
detection. Ensure
updated virus
definitions and create
custom signatures for
observed malware.

12/19

T1550 – Use Alternate Authentication Material:
Adversaries may use alternate authentication
material, such as password hashes, Kerberos
tickets, and application access tokens, in order to
move laterally within an environment and bypass
normal system access controls.

M1026 - Privileged
Account
Management:
Limit credential
overlap across
systems to prevent
the damage of
credential
compromise and
reduce the
adversary's ability to
perform Lateral
Movement between
systems.

M1018 - User Account Management:
Enforce the principle of least-privilege. Do not allow
a domain user to be in the local administrator group
on multiple systems.
Credential Access

T1555 – Credentials
from Password
Stores:
Adversaries may
search for common
password storage
locations to obtain
user credentials.
Passwords are stored
in several places on a
system, depending on
the operating system
or application holding
the credentials. There
are also specific
applications that store
passwords to make it
easier for users
manage and maintain.
Once credentials are
obtained, they can be
used to perform
lateral movement and
access restricted
information.

M1027 - Password
Policies:
The password for the
user's login keychain
can be changed from
the user's login
password. This
increases the
complexity for an
adversary because
they need to know an
additional password.
Organizations may
consider weighing the
risk of storing
credentials in
password stores and
web browsers. If
system, software, or
web browser
credential disclosure
is a significant
concern, technical
controls, policy, and
user training may be
used to prevent
storage of credentials
in improper locations.

13/19

T1003.005 – OS Credential Dumping: Cached
Domain Credentials:
Adversaries may attempt to access cached domain
credentials used to allow authentication to occur in
the event a domain controller is unavailable.

M1015 - Active
Directory
Configuration:
Consider adding
users to the
"Protected Users"
Active Directory
security group. This
can help limit the
caching of users'
plaintext credentials.

M1028 - Operating System Configuration:
Consider limiting the number of cached credentials
(HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\Current
Version\Winlogon\cachedlogonscountvalue)
M1027 - Password Policies:
Ensure that local administrator accounts have
complex, unique passwords across all systems on
the network.
M1026 - Privileged Account Management:
Do not put user or admin domain accounts in the
local administrator groups across systems unless
they are tightly controlled, as this is often
equivalent to having a local administrator account
with the same password on all systems. Follow
best practices for design and administration of an
enterprise network to limit privileged account use
across administrative tiers.
M1017 - User Training:
Limit credential overlap across accounts and
systems by training users and administrators not to
use the same password for multiple accounts.

14/19

Lateral Movement

T1021.001 – Remote
Services – Remote
Desktop Protocol:
Adversaries may use
Valid Accounts to log
into a computer using
the Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP). The
adversary may then
perform actions as the
logged-on user.

M1047 - Audit:
Audit the Remote
Desktop Users group
membership regularly.
Remove unnecessary
accounts and groups
from Remote Desktop
Users groups.

M1042 - Disable or Remove Feature or Program:
Disable the RDP service if it is unnecessary.
M1035 - Limit Access to Resource Over Network:
Use remote desktop gateways.
M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication:
Use multi-factor authentication for remote logins.
M1030 - Network Segmentation:
Do not leave RDP accessible from the internet.
Enable firewall rules to block RDP traffic between
network security zones within a network.
M1028 - Operating System Configuration:
Change GPOs to define shorter timeouts sessions
and maximum amount of time any single session
can be active. Change GPOs to specify the
maximum amount of time that a disconnected
session stays active on the RD session host server.
M1026 - Privileged Account Management:
Consider removing the local Administrators group
from the list of groups allowed to log in through
RDP.
M1018 - User Account Management:
Limit remote user permissions if remote access is
necessary.

15/19

T1570 – Lateral Tool Transfer:
Adversaries may transfer tools or other files
between systems in a compromised environment.
Files may be copied from one system to another to
stage adversary tools or other files over the course
of an operation.

M1037 - Filter
Network Traffic:
Consider using the
host firewall to restrict
file sharing
communications such
as SMB.

M1031 - Network Intrusion Prevention:
Network intrusion detection and prevention
systems that use network signatures to identify
traffic for specific adversary malware or unusual
data transfer over known tools and protocols like
FTP can be used to mitigate activity at the network
level. Signatures are often for unique indicators
within protocols and may be based on the specific
obfuscation technique used by a particular
adversary or tool, and will likely be different across
various malware families and versions.
T1080 – Taint Shared Content:
Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote
systems by adding content to shared storage
locations, such as network drives or internal code
repositories. Content stored on network drives or in
other shared locations may be tainted by adding
malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to
otherwise valid files.

M1038 - Execution
Prevention:
Identify potentially
malicious software
that may be used to
taint content or may
result from it and audit
and/or block the
unknown programs by
using application
control tools, like
AppLocker, or
Software Restriction
Policies where
appropriate.

M1050 - Exploit Protection:
Use utilities that detect or mitigate common
features used in exploitation, such as the Microsoft
Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).
M1022 - Restrict File and Directory Permissions:
Protect shared folders by minimizing users who
have write access.

16/19

Exfiltration

T1041 – Exfiltration
Over C2 Channel:

M1057 - Data Loss
Prevention:

Adversaries may steal
data by exfiltrating it
over an existing
command and control
channel. Stolen data
is encoded into the
normal
communications
channel using the
same protocol as
command and control
communications.

Data loss prevention
can detect and block
sensitive data being
sent over unencrypted
protocols.

M1031 - Network Intrusion Prevention:
Network intrusion detection and prevention
systems that use network signatures to identify
traffic for specific adversary malware can be used
to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures
are often for unique indicators within protocols and
may be based on the specific obfuscation
technique used by a particular adversary or tool,
and will likely be different across various malware
families and versions. Adversaries will likely
change tool command and control signatures over
time or construct protocols in such a way to avoid
detection by common defensive tools.
T1567.002 – Exfiltration Over Web Service:
Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:

M1021 - Restrict
Web-Based Content:

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage
service rather than over their primary command
and control channel. Cloud storage services allow
for the storage, edit, and retrieval of data from a
remote cloud storage server over the Internet.

Web proxies can be
used to enforce an
external network
communication policy
that prevents use of
unauthorized external
services.

17/19

Impact

T1486 - Data
Encrypted for Impact:
Adversaries may
encrypt data on target
systems or on large
numbers of systems
in a network to
interrupt availability to
system and network
resources. They can
attempt to render
stored data
inaccessible by
encrypting files or
data on local and
remote drives and
withholding access to
a decryption key.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint: On
Windows 10, enable
cloud-delivered
protection and Attack
Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block
the execution of files
that resemble
ransomware.

M1053 - Data Backup: Consider implementing IT
disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for
regularly taking and testing data backups that can
be used to restore organizational data. Ensure
backups are stored off system and is protected
from common methods adversaries may use to
gain access and destroy the backups to prevent
recovery. Consider enabling versioning in cloud
environments to maintain backup copies of storage
objects.
T1490 - Inhabit System Recovery:
Adversaries may delete or remove built-in
operating system data and turn off services
designed to aid in the recovery of a corrupted
system to prevent recovery. Operating systems
may contain features that can help fix corrupted
systems, such as a backup catalog, volume
shadow copies, and automatic repair features.
Adversaries may disable or delete system recovery
features to augment the effects of Data Destruction
and Data Encrypted for Impact.

M1053 - Data
Backup: Consider
implementing IT
disaster recovery
plans that contain
procedures for taking
regular data backups
that can be used to
restore organizational
data. Ensure backups
are stored off system
and is protected from
common methods
adversaries may use
to gain access and
destroy the backups
to prevent recovery.

18/19

M1028 - Operating System Configuration: Consider
technical controls to prevent the disabling of
services or deletion of files involved in system
recovery.
T1489 - Service Stop:
Adversaries may stop or disable services on a
system to render those services unavailable to
legitimate users. Stopping critical services or
processes can inhibit or stop response to an
incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives
to cause damage to the environment.

M1030 - Network
Segmentation:
Operate intrusion
detection, analysis,
and response
systems on a
separate network
from the production
environment to lessen
the chances that an
adversary can see
and interfere with
critical response
functions.

M1022 - Restrict File and Directory Permissions:
Ensure proper process and file permissions are in
place to inhibit adversaries from disabling or
interfering with critical services.
M1024 - Restrict Registry Permissions: Ensure
proper registry permissions are in place to inhibit
adversaries from disabling or interfering with critical
services.
M1018 - User Account Management: Limit
privileges of user accounts and groups so that only
authorized administrators can interact with service
changes and service configurations.
