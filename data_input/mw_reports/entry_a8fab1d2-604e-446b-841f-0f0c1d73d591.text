During the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise, threat actors lurked in the victim’s
network for more than a year. Discovered by FireEye in December 2020, the earliest traces
of a modified SolarWinds Orion go back as early as October 2019. Although these early

versions did not contain the malicious backdoor (this was added in March 2020), it means
attackers were able to remain hidden for a long time. This sleeper threat affected
corporations and government agencies around the world. To counter these, we need to be
aware of mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to response (MTTR) when detecting
this kind of attack.
To pull off such a long-lasting con, the attackers required a high level of refinement and
planning. That’s something you associate with an advanced persistent threat (APT). These
APTs, often launched by nation-states or state-sponsored actors, are stealthy and strive to
remain hidden for a long time. (Contrast this with hacktivists, who often intend to make a
visible statement, like internet graffiti.) APTs choose their targets carefully and tread as lightly
as possible until they reach their final goal.
These objectives are often political or economic. They go beyond the financial gain sought
by those who deploy ransomware. And while single components of these attacks are maybe
not considered advanced, their operations and planning are top notch. When they do attack,
they avoid interrupting business since that would give away their presence. In a later stage,
they can still decide to push the destruct button, though. For example, they might want to
cover up tracks, as revenge or a statement.

Sleeper Threats
The global median dwell time, or the number of days before an intrusion is detected and the
threat is neutralized, was 56 days in 2019. These 56 days already provide ample time for
attackers to do their work. What about the fact that 12% of the investigations had dwell times
greater than 700 days? This provides plenty of chances to access confidential data, exfiltrate
secrets and cause financial and legal harm.
Before jumping into specifics on how to reduce this dwell time, let’s look at the performance
metrics to describe the time to detection and response.

MTTD and MTTR
MTTD is the average time it takes for your security team to discover an incident. This metric
can be found by adding up the total time it takes to detect incidents and dividing that by the
number of incidents. The mean time to detect covers three phases. First, you collect event
data, then apply some logic to this data to discover strange behavior. As a final step, do an
assessment to determine if the activity is indeed a threat.
Meanwhile, MTTR measures the average time it takes to contain and repair a threat.
(Sometimes this is also referred to as the mean time to recover.) The mean time to respond
follows when your assessment indicates there is a likelihood of a threat. Your team then
looks at the data to determine the exact nature and impact of the incident. Following this, you
can start repairs to neutralize the intrusion.

The MTTD and MTTR metrics can serve as a barometer for the strength of your defenses.
Shortening the MTTD and MTTR and stopping an attack not only limits the impact of a
breach and prevents loss of money and standing, it also prevents legal harm. For example,
the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive and the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) require timely notifications of incidents.
So, how can you lower the dwell time and reduce MTTR and MTTD?

Reduce the MTTD
One of the essential elements for detecting attacks is not really that novel. It’s about having
fine-grained insight into what’s happening in your landscape. You can do this by employing
targeted log management. Make sure the logs contain information that is actually helpful
when spotting strange events. Then, centralize the collected logs, events and alerts. Use
them for correlation, such as in a SIEM. In addition, you can use network sensors that
capture network packets and flows, and use end-point alert and activity tracking.
Collecting the data is only the first step in reducing the MTTD. The sheer volume of data is
most likely staggering. There are always too many alerts and not enough time to chase them
all. To make things worse, defense teams have to work with different tools, confusing user
interfaces and different event formats and log types. Wading through all the data to do an
assessment is impossible. How can we cut out these obstacles and assess if a certain event
poses a real threat?
The answer lies in using automated incident response to reduce the dwell time, often
referred to as SOAR. This automates routine investigative tasks and automatically launches
responses when an alert is detected, greatly reducing the MTTR. It completely removes the
time needed to inform analysts and wait for a human follow-up, which also greatly reduces
MTTD and MTTR. A SOAR system can interact with different tools and then provide a single
overview pane for your analysts. This type of integration cannot happen overnight, though.
Start small, assess what works within your environment and extend your model with more
sources.
Take a proactive approach to threats

Define ‘Normal’
Automation requires you to do some prep work. First, you need to set a baseline and define
what is normal. This alone can already be very challenging. But if you want to identify
potential sleeper technology hiding in your environment, you need to know what’s likely and
what’s unlikely in each case.
Start from a base image installation and find the installed programs, running services
and the typical system utilization.

Profile not only the behavior of systems and apps but also the behavior of users. For
example business hours, device usage, volume of files accessed and internet usage.
Baselining the network traffic helps to identify odd ports and protocols. It also highlights
abnormal packet sizes, suspicious volumes of transferred data or lengthy connections.
Understand which domain names your group commonly uses. Isolate domain names
that are used by only a couple of devices or users or only during specific timeframes.

Visualize All Things
Another good method is visualizing the event and alert data of your environment. Although
visualizing performance indicators have their merits, they are only a subset of what’s
important to represent in dashboards. Other items to include are:
Event, log and alert timelines
Events matching with threat data
VPN and network usage by protocol, sources, destinations, port usage, length of
connection and volume
Domain name analysis
System and service activity
User activities on multiple or different systems in a short timespan, including lateral
movement of users between systems
New devices, apps, services and processes
Changes in roles, users, groups and group memberships
Logon activity, failures, logouts and credential changes
File volume and user file activity

Security Monitoring With MTTD
Although a large portion of the alerts can be handled via your automated responses, you still
need a team of specialists to monitor what’s happening. They can use the centrally collected
alerts, events and visualizations to spot anomalies. This team, often in the form of a security
operations center, plays a crucial role in looking after your environment, responding to alerts
and reducing the MTTD. The playbooks help them to execute this response in a consistent
and uniform way.
As in the case of the SolarWinds attacks, the threat actors aren’t ordinary ‘script kiddies’.
Some of the threat groups have their foundation in traditional espionage and can be very
determined to breach your environment. Stopping just one technique or putting a halt to a
first intrusion doesn’t make these groups give up. They’ll just attempt another approach.
Automation, baselining, visualization and monitoring is not your only answer to reduce the
MTTD and uncover the activity of these groups.

Improve Your MTTD Maturity
4/7

Another important element is to improve and work on the maturity of your team in an ongoing
manner. The Security Incident Management Maturity Model is a good guide to improving
your incident detection and response capabilities. This framework focuses on organizational
aspects such as establishing a sufficient set of policies and having a governance framework.
An important aspect of this is to create robust incident response plans and document the
roles and responsibilities in your incident response workflow. These incident response plans
also serve as the basis for your playbooks, which then steer the automated detection and
mitigation.
People are still the driving force behind a well-functioning detection and response program.
Ensure that your incident response plans take into account the way departments work
together and talk among themselves. Carefully sort the workflows between different teams to
prevent snags.
Training and regular exercises help your team to stay alert and practice their skills. Your
security team must understand the incident response processes and have insights into
common attacks, threat actor techniques, and best practices for how to defend against them.
Focus on these key points in trainings:
Determine how reliable and accurate the information received from your detection
capabilities is. Train your team to understand the blurry areas and explore those that do
not always provide conclusive information.
Which weaknesses can you find where actors can bypass detection?
Train your team to be fluent in making records of their findings, and use this to improve
playbooks and plans.
Document other steps required to confirm or deny false positives.

What’s Next for MTTD?
Because attackers keep improving their game, you’ll have to make sure you keep up with
them. There is, however, a limit to what you can do with alert-based monitoring to reduce the
MTTD. We already covered baselining and using it to detect anomalies in system and user
activities. But there’s more. You can also use machine analytics and implement scenarios
based on real life tools, techniques and procedures to improve your workflows and anomaly
detections.
In the end, the key is to extend your detection capabilities with a well-functioning threat
intelligence platform that can look out for sleeper threats in your sector.
