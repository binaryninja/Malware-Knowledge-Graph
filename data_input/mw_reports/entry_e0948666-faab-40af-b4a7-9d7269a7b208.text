The Threat
Trojans
A Trojan is a piece of malware that appears to the user to perform a desirable function but—perhaps in addition to the
expected function—steals information or harms the system. Trojans employ two main techniques to steal users’
credentials or initiate money transfers on their behalf:
•

Modifying the website’s client-side web page.

•

Sniffing the browser’s activity for information, such as that sent to different banks, before the packets are
encrypted by SSL.

Script injections
Several e-banking Trojans (such as Neverquest, Dyre, and Dridex) have used script injection techniques to modify the
original web page. The modification may enable the attacker to perform money transactions using victims’ credentials.
This may be perpetrated by a Trojan injecting a malicious JavaScript code to the client’s browser, once the client is
connected to the website. The injected code may perform different functions, including attempting a money transfer from
the client’s account, gaining control on mobile devices, and much more.
To maintain the information sent by the Trojan, attackers have developed different types of command and control (C&C)
systems that enable them to grab and manage the Trojan. These systems are usually PHP-based systems
accompanied by a SQL database.

About Tinba
Tinba, also known as Tinybanker, Zusy, and HµNT€R$, is a banking Trojan that was first seen in the wild around May
2012. Its source code was leaked in July 2011, and since then it has evolved. Cybercriminals have customized the
leaked code to create even more sophisticated pieces of malware that are being used to attack a large number of
popular banking websites around the world. Until now, four new variants had been identified. Tinbapore is the fifth.
The original Tinba malware was written in the assembly programming language and was noted for its very small size
(around 20 KB including all Webinjects and configuration). The malware mostly uses four system libraries during
runtime: ntdll.dll, advapi32.dll, ws2_32.dll, and user32.dll. Its main functionality is hooking all the browsers on the
infected machine so it can intercept HTTP requests and perform web injections.
Newer and improved versions of the malware employ a domain generation algorithm (DGA), which makes the malware
much more persistent and gives it the ability to come back to life even after a command and control (C&C) server is
taken down. This new variant of Tinba, Tinbapore, now creates its own instance of explorer.exe that runs in the
background. It differs from most previous versions in that it actively targets financial entities in the Asian Pacific (APAC),
which was previously uncharted territory for Tinba.

Tinbapore Malware Analysis Details
Upon execution, the malware initially infects the system by opening the winver.exe process—a legitimate Windows
applet that shows the Windows version—injecting itself into it, and propagating into explorer.exe.
Then, while operating through explorer.exe, the malware writes itself as a bin.exe file into the \Application Data\ folder
with a randomly generated subfolder.

System function hooks
Tinbapore gains control over the system by hooking several functions inside the ntdll.dll library. The hooked functions
are NtCreateProcessEx, NtCreateThread, NtEnumerateValueKey, NtQueryDirectoryFile, and NtResumeThread.

Figure 2: Functions hooked by Tinbapore

Auto-run entries
In order to stay persistent in the system, the malware writes two auto-run locations, making it start with Windows at
boot. The auto-runs are written into the registry in both HKEY CURRENT_USER and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry
hives, under the Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key.

Deployment
Tinbapore writes deployed files into the \Application Data\ folder.
•

log.dat, ntf.dat—These are used to store the collected data from the infected machine before that data is sent
to the C&C server. These files are encrypted and removed right after being written.

•

bin.exe—This malware executable file is run on system boot.

•

web.dat—This Webinject configuration file is written when downloaded from the C&C.

Browser function hooks
When a browser application is executed, the malware injects itself into the process and hooks wininet.dll library
functions, which allows it to perform browser injections. The hooked functions are HttpQueryInfoA, HttpSendRequestA,
HttpSendRequestW, InternetCloseHandle, InternetQueryDataAvailable, InternetReadFile, and InternetReadFileExA.
Tinbapore also lowers security settings and sets the DisplayMixedContentInternet option to zero (0). This allows
attackers to perform browser injections without prompting the user.

Rootkit
The malware is a rootkit, meaning that by hooking system functions, it has higher system privileges than the user, so it
can hide itself from the user’s eyes, making it impossible to remove manually. Special anti-rootkit tools, such as
IceSword, are required to see the malware registry keys and files on disk.

Webinject Analysis
In a departure from previous versions of Tinba, which usually did not target Asian financial entities, the new Tinbapore
variant does target financial institutions in Asia and the Pacific (as well as U.S. and European institutions). The largest
percentage of the targeted entities are in Singapore.

MALWARE ANALYSIS REPORT
Tinbapore: Millions of Dollars at Risk

The injected script shown above in Figure 5 is part of Tinbapore’s Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS) engine injection
management system, which injects content into the victim’s browser and sends the logged information back to the ATS
server.
After being injected into the victim’s browser, the script is then deleted to cover its tracks.

For most of the targeted entities to date, injected content has shown the message in Figure 7 on the user’s machine
while initiating the fraudulent activity. The Google translation for this message is “We are working on updating the
database, so that the service is temporarily unavailable. We will try to resume the service as soon as possible. Please
try again in a few hours.”

WebSafe Detection of Tinbapore
®

The F5 WebSafe™ security solution detected the Tinbapore malware attack in real time, and the F5 Security
Operations Center™ (SOC) took immediate action to shut down attack resources, although Tinbapore’s DGA
capabilities make the malware very persistent and give it the ability to come back to life even after a C&C server is taken
down.

Malicious URLs
Tinbapore resources detected by WebSafe and shut down by the SOC include the following malicious URLs:
• hxxps://base-ssl.ru

Tinbapore Targets
To date, Singapore has been the country most targeted by the Tinbapore malware. It accounts for 30 percent of the
attacked institutions known to the F5 SOC. Indonesian financial institutions also are at risk of losing millions of dollars,
as another 20 percent of the targeted entities are based in this country.

Figure 8: Tinbapore targeted entities by country

Financial institutions in APAC are not the only ones at risk; the malware has also targeted institutions in the Europe,
Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region and the Americas. However, it is clear that the majority of attacks target financial
institutions in Asia and the Pacific.
