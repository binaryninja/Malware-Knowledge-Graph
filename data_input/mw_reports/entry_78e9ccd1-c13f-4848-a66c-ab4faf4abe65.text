Executive Summary
Previous General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Services (Fidelis) reporting, ref: Fidelis Threat
Advisory (FTA) #1011 dated 15 Jan 2014, introduced a malware system comprised of multiple
files that provided a means for intruders to discover and retrieve data from disparate computer
systems via removable storage devices. The malware system consists of at least two Portable
Executable (PE) files, one acting as a headquarters component and one acting as field unit or
agent component. The headquarters component infects drives connected to its host system with
the field unit component and retrieves data from the field unit on the infected drive’s return to the
headquarters host system. The field unit conducts reconnaissance and data collection in
accordance with particular commands.
Continuing analysis solidified the headquarters component’s Command and Control (C2) scheme.
The malware receives commands from a locally stored encrypted file.
This report describes select malware functionality with some granularity, provides extended detail
regarding the headquarters component’s C2 functionality, provides additional means of defensive
detection of this malware and describes some interesting aspects of the malware as a whole.

The Fidelis team updated Fidelis XPS advanced threat defense system with additional rules to
reflect current analysis findings associated with this malware.

Forensic Analysis Findings
Basic Functionality
Previous reporting, ref: Fidelis Threat Advisory (FTA) #1011 dated 15 Jan 2014, introduced a
malware system comprised of multiple files that reflected a means for intruders to discover and
retrieve data from disparate computer systems via removable storage devices. Analysis of the
system relied on the availability of two files named netsat.exe and netui3.dll. Netsat.exe
functioned as a master application affording intruders the ability, in a selective and controlled
manner, to infest removable devices with an agent application in the form of netui3.dll, aka

setup35.exe, aka update.exe. Previous reporting likened netsat.exe as a headquarters application
and netui3.dll as a field unit with the following basic functionality:
Headquarters (netsat.exe)
• Running on a possibly compromised system
• Logging some activity and errors to a file
• Receiving commands via an encrypted file on the local system (possible C2)
• Listening for drive connections
• Infecting connected drives with netui3.dll/winmgt.dll (setup35.exe + Autorun.inf)
• Collecting data gathered by any infected drives, ostensibly upon their return from
being connected to other systems
Field Unit (netui3.dll)
• Collecting information about systems it comes into contact with through connection to
the targeted systems with the drive whereon the malware resides
• Collecting file listings from local and share connected drives
• Discovering and connecting to shared drives visible to the local targeted system
• Copying and writing files to/from drives visible to the local targeted system
The following graphic serves to illustrate a possible basic theory of operation given available
data:

The malware attempts to ensure errors are suppressed and not observed by a user
The malware performs specific environment checking to adapt to Windows versions
from at least Windows 2000 to Windows7/Server 2008 and up
The malware terminates if it detects another iteration of itself via the Mutex
“Mtx_Sp_on_PC_1_2_8”
The malware terminates if any Gateway IPs associated with the resident system are
in the 10.x.x.x range
The malware copies itself to
<CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA>\Microsoft\Windows\Help\update.exe
The malware runs update.exe with the parameters “-wu external drive letter”, e.g., z:,
with the temporary directory specified for the working directory
The malware copies a file named ~disk.ini from the infected drive to
<CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA>\Microsoft\Windows\Help\intr
The malware checks the system date against 31 May 2013; if on or after, the

Previous analysis results indicated netsat.exe retrieved commands from an encrypted file named
netwn.drv resident in the CSIDL_WINDOWS\msagent\ directory. The encryption was a Tiny
Encryption Algorithm (TEA) implementation that used a key that was modified during encryption
and decryption operations.

Analysis efforts did not have access to ‘command’ files retrieved from the victim systems for
either the headquarters or the field unit applications. However, using the malware’s behavior and
determining the command file’s format via reverse engineering afforded the ability to test
numerous assumptions about the malware’s intended use. Analysis determined the command
format was: drive identification followed by one or more command and parameter strings. The
following table reflects testing and theoretical contents of command files driving netsat.exe
operation:

Interesting	  Artifacts	  and	  Observations	  
Previous and continuing analysis results indicated some interesting and/or relevant
aspects of this malware:
• The malware tries to be quiet - error handling
• There was robust implementation intention across Windows versions
• The malware employs robust environment checking; frustrating inadvertent
execution and analysis
• The malware prevents multiple iterations of itself on individual systems
• The malware does not run on systems using Gateways assigned a particular
internal net range (10.x.x.x)
• The malware’s execution has an expiration date
• The malware purposely obfuscates and complicates C2
• The malware injects complexity into C2 encryption operations; obfuscating
execution and frustrating/delaying analysis
• The malware uses obscure file system paths
• The malware author, ironically or purposely, named a collected data storage
folder ‘Intel’

+1800.652.4020
The following interesting questions/assumptions emerged from previous cursory
analysis of this malware:
•

•

C2 appears to be accomplished via providing commands in an encrypted file
stored on the local ‘master’ system (re: netsat.exe). This C2 scheme would
seem to dictate:
o Intruder remote access to the ‘master’ system
o Intruder local access to the ‘master’ system
o a C2 delivery/retrieval component, such as another piece of code that
downloads a C2 file
Available information precludes determination of the means of exfiltration.
Netsat.exe’s data collection functionality suggested data destined for
exfiltration might be collected by the ‘master’ system. This possibility
suggests:
o Intruder remote access to the ‘master’ system
o Intruder local access to the ‘master’ system
o An exfiltration mechanism in the form of another piece of code

Further analysis confirms the malware’s use of an encrypted file stored on the system
whereon the malware is executing without an apparent means of automatic generation.
This continues to suggest that intruders either have local or remote access to
headquarters systems running netsat.exe or access to another application that
automates remote C2 data/file retrieval. Intruders’ apparent ability to distinguish between
particular field unit vehicles (infected drives), ref: Possible	  Commands	  One	  -­‐	  Targeting	  Specific	  
Devices	  (Known	  to	  Intruder	  From	  Previous	  netsat/netui3	  Activity)	  from	  Hypothetical	  command	  table,	  
suggests active engagement with the malware and targets.
Conclusion	  
This report is based on information extracted from reverse engineering and analysis of
two PE files. There are other components and artifacts of this malware that are currently
inaccessible to Fidelis analysts. Therefore, analysts extrapolated some of the behavior
presented here. While analysts are confident about behaviors described to date, there
could certainly be additional behaviors and nuances heretofore unseen.
Analysis of this malware continues to suggest that a sophisticated effort was behind its
creation and employment. Actors went to great lengths to make the malware efficient
and effective while building in obfuscation and complexity. Interesting artifacts and
observations continue to be discovered and made, such as the malware’s apparent
expiration, the interesting naming convention for a directory to hold collected data, and
the actors’ apparent intention to avoid certain networks or network addressing schemes.
