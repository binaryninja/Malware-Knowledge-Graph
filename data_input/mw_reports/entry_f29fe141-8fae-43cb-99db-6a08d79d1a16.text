Czech cybersecurity software firm Avast has released a decryption utility to help
TargetCompany ransomware victims recover their files for free.
However, as Avast warns, this decryptor can only be used to restore encrypted files "under
certain circumstances."
Victims who want to recover their files using this decrypting tool should also be aware that
this will likely be a resource-intensive and time-consuming process.
"During password cracking, all your available processor cores will spend most of their
computing power to find the decryption password. The cracking process may take a large
amount of time, up to tens of hours," Avast said.
"The decryptor periodically saves the progress and if you interrupt it and restart the
decryptor later, it offers you an option to resume the previously started cracking process."

The TargetCompany ransomware decryptor works by cracking the password after
comparing an encrypted file with its original unencrypted version.
Avast says this only has to be done once per each device encrypted by TargetCompany
ransomware since the decryptor wizard will allow you to enter previously cracked encryption
passwords by selecting the "I know the password for decrypting files."

TargetCompany ransomware victims can download the decryption tool from Avast's
servers (64-bit or 32-bit) to decrypt entire disk partitions using the instructions
displayed within the tool's user interface.
"On the final wizard page, you can opt-in whether you want to backup encrypted files.
These backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process," Avast
added.
"This option is turned on by default, which we recommend. After clicking 'Decrypt,' the
decryption process begins. Let the decryptor work and wait until it finishes."
You can find additional instructions on how to use Avast's TargetCompany ransomware
decryptor here.
TargetCompany is a relatively newly discovered ransomware strain, active since mid-June
2021, that will add a .mallox, .exploit, .architek, or .brg extension to all encrypted files.

It also drops a ransom note file named "HOW TO RECOVER !!.TXT" in all folders
containing encrypted files.
This happens after it deletes volume shadow copies, reconfigures boot options, and kills
processes that could lock databases of sensitive information (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, SQL
Server).
Avast also released free decryptors for Babuk, AtomSilo, and LockFile ransomware in
October 2021 to allow victims to recover their files without paying a ransom.
