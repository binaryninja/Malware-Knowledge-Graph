Trend Micro | Operation C-Major: Information Theft Campaign Targets Military Personnel in India

Introduction
The Trend Micro Forward-Looking Threat Research team recently uncovered an information
theft campaign in India that has stolen passport scans, photo IDs, and tax information of highranking Indian military officers, non-Indian military attaché based in the said country, among
others. We came across this operation while monitoring other targeted attack campaigns,1,2 and
what caught our interest, apart from its highly targeted nature, is the lack of sophistication in the
tools and tactics it used.
Apart from using email and social engineering as entry point, this operation exploits a relatively
old vulnerability, uses a malware that can easily be decompiled for a researcher to map out its
network infrastructure, and has command-and-control (C&C) servers with open directories
where exfiltrated data can be accessed and analyzed. Compared to its contemporaries, in terms
of technique this targeted attack campaign is amateur at best, sloppy at worst. Despite this, it
was able to get at least 16 gigabytes’ worth of data from 160 targets.
Our analysis also leads us to believe that the attackers are located in Pakistan, although there is
no evidence to suggest this attack is tied to the Pakistani government. We also have reason to
believe that this operation also goes for information found in mobile devices of its targets.
This technical brief provides a detailed look into the operation: its targets, its tools and its
tactics.

The attack
Like most targeted attacks, the actors behind this campaign use email as their point of entry. As
in most targeted attacks, the attackers have a very good idea what the individual targets are
interested in, what subjects they are most likely to click on, and use this to their advantage.
Below is a sample email from this group, which was sent to the military attaché of a foreign
country who was assigned to India:

Once the PDF files are opened using Adobe Acrobat Reader, an exploit is triggered which drops
a malicious Windows executable file—a Trojan—which then connects to and communicates
with the C&C server. The main features of this Trojan are keylogging and password theft;
however, the attackers, upon their request, can also make it record audio, steal any amount of
files, or take screenshots. Invariably, after a few minutes, the server instructs the infected client
to upload the keystroke log.
We assume that the attackers would use these logs to determine if the affected system is
interesting enough that they need to perform more actions against it. More technical information
about the binary and the C&C communication protocol can be found in the appendix below.
The malware is also compiled into a Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) binary using
Visual Studio. This means that: 1) the original source code was probably VB# (Visual Basic
.NET) or C# (.NET version of C++), and; 2) the developers don’t know (or didn’t care) that these
programs can be easily decompiled. This shows an unusual case of targeted information theft
where the attackers are providing the source code for free. This implies that the threat actors
responsible for it are not very sophisticated, not knowledgeable, or both.

The threat actors’ command-and-control (C&C) servers have open directories, and from there
we were also able to identify Microsoft Office files related to several other campaigns against
other Indian targets:

The targets
We found three open directories on the C&C servers associated with this operation.

These directories contained more than 16 gigabytes’ worth of the targets’ data, and a careful
analysis of the 160 records found in these directories gave us a good idea of the kind of people
the attackers were after. The majority of them belonged to officers of the Indian army, although
we identified some as IT consultants and/or resellers. The data that were exfiltrated from these
people included:
Passport scans and other photo IDs
Salary and taxation data (Indian army PDF payslips)
Army strategic and tactical documents
Army training documentation
Personal photos

The personal data of the targets identified them as brigadiers, colonels, lieutenant colonels,
majors, and lieutenants.

Command-and-control (C&C) servers
The malware connects to a single C&C server hardcoded into the malicious binary. Different
campaigns use different C&C servers and ports. Here are some of the servers in use:



93.104.213.217:1337
95.85.43.35:9999

Using reverse DNS, we were able to find associated domain names for the above IP addresses,
as follows:







93.104.213.217 – vmi22485.contabo.host – Contabo is the ISP hosting this server.
95.85.43.35 – bbmsync2727.com
213.136.79.50 – bluesync2121.com
82.196.13.94 – pradahandbagsshoes.com
178.238.235.143 – vdjunky.org – also m1343.contabo.host
80.240.134.51 – ordering-checks.com

Older C&C servers give us the following information, too:


bhai1.ddns.net:3050 (182.185.110.142) – This IP is hosted in Pakistan.

Especially interesting for us is the domain vdjunky.org. It was registered with the email address
akml614@yahoo.com. This address was also used to register other malicious domains, as
follows:




Idnnews.net (91.194.91.202)
Mpjunkie.com (193.164.131.225)
Pbxmobiflex.com (178.238.230.88)

In addition, we found five more domains with a familiar pattern, the same as some of the C&C
servers listed above. In fact, all of them are, or have been, C&C servers.






Applemedia1218.com (213.136.79.50)
Avssync3357.com (213.136.79.50)
Bluesync2121.com (213.136.79.50)
Eastmedia2112.com (75.98.175.79 and 213.136.79.50)
Mvssync8767.com (213.136.79.50)

If we look at the first three domain names along with our original vdjunky.org, we see more
interesting things too: pbxmobiflex.com was used as the C&C server of an Android spying app.
This mobile malware can read the affected user’s SMS and listen to phone conversations. We
9

Trend Micro | Operation C-Major: Information Theft Campaign Targets Military Personnel in India

suspect that malicious apps running on iOS and Blackberry may also connect to this same
server, presumably used in similar spying campaigns.
While it is possible that the Windows and mobile malware are owned by different actors who are
only sharing a hosted server, at least one news article3 from Indian media reports that this very
server was used to spy on Android users from the Indian army. Chances are that the same
actors are behind both operations.
In addition, we found that a server connected with this group, 93.104.213.217, is actually a live
C&C for a Windows .EXE file called “NATO soldier killed in firefight between US_ Afghan
forces.exe”. This same server also acts as the C&C for an off-the-shelf Android malware called
Sandrorat. We believe that there is a definite connection between the Android malware, these
actors, and their spying campaigns against India.

The Pakistani connection
Although we cannot be 100% certain who is behind the operation and exactly where it is coming
from, there are certain clues that point to it with a high probability. First, the Indian army is
targeted by both the Android and Windows versions of this malware. The older C&C servers of
this malware were located in Pakistan until they were moved to Internet service providers (ISPs)
in Western countries. The new C&C servers seem to be administered by somebody located in
Pakistan.
Another interesting fact is that malware samples from this group get a lot of rescans on
VirusTotal by the same user ID from Pakistan. The picture this paints becomes clearer: threat
actors (without much training or resources) located in Pakistan are responsible for attacks
against targets predominantly tied to the Indian Army.
These actors send emails to high-ranking officers with relevant social engineering techniques,
and are intent on stealing information. Additionally, there is evidence that these same attackers
infect mobile phones of Indian army officers with spyware that steals communication data.

Conclusion
When one thinks of targeted attacks, the first thought always goes to bigger countries with big
budgets and very tight well-thought-out operations. As Operation C-Major shows, smaller
players are in this game, too, and what they may lack in technical sophistication, they make up
for through tenacity, persistence and clever social engineering.
For those in charge of defending a corporate or organization network, this attack reinforces the
fact that any user, regardless of rank or position, is susceptible in becoming the organization’s
weakest security link. As such, while network defenders should be prepared to help prevent, or
minimize the damage of attacks, people who use the said network should likewise be
knowledgeable of threats that could possibly come. The need for proper user awareness
training is clear.
In the same way that there are different levels of cybercriminals with varying levels of
sophistication, the same thing applies to threat actors and info-stealing attacks. Methods of
defense in the technological realm are, of course, recommended—one could say they are a
must nowadays—but do not underestimate plain social engineering attacks on the basis that
only cybercriminals lurk behind all malicious attachments.
The attackers don't need to be high-tech in order to conduct a successful targeted attack
operation and in cases such as these, the same thing can be said of a successful defense.

Appendix

Technical Features

The malware used in the operation is an information-stealing Trojan. Its main purpose seems to
be obtaining and exfiltrating information from the target Windows computer and uploading it to
an external server. Although it is flexible in what it can do, by observing the ways it is being
installed in its targets, we believe this to be a targeted operation.
Based on how this Trojan was programmed and compiled, it’s highly doubtful that it came from
a well-funded organization. Rather, it appears that a modest, low-profile developer team or even
a single programmer created it.
The strings within the malware code are in English, although the amount of misspellings point to
a non-native English speaker. The EXE seems to have been compiled in Visual Studio and
programmed in VB#. Therefore, the final product is a .NET binary that has not been obfuscated,
and the original function names and variables are kept as they were written. This makes
analysis much easier.

Main program
The main program’s internal name is msdocuments but the attackers rename it depending on
the social engineering theme used against the target. We have observed names like
securescan.exe and wservices.exe. The original internal version we analyzed was 1.0.0.0,
which implements a primitive communication protocol with the C&C server that only supports
updates. This communication happens through a high TCP port; ports 1337, 9990, 9999 and
others have been observed. Once the client connects for the first time to the server, it stays
quiet. Then the server responds with a string: “info=command”, which the client does not
immediately reply to. After a brief moment, the client starts sending the following command:

updatc=<user> | <machine> | WINDOWS <AV_installed>

In this command, the client is requesting an update for the infected computer. <user> refers to
the logged in user name and <machine> to the hostname of the infected PC. “WINDOWS” is a
12

Trend Micro | Operation C-Major: Information Theft Campaign Targets Military Personnel in India

hardcoded string, although we have not seen other OS ports of this Trojan. <AV installed> is a
key string that the client assigns based on an analysis of the process list. If no active antivirus
program is found, this string is “Not.Found”. Otherwise, there are a few strings, like
“[Kaspersky]”, “[Symantec]”, “[Microsoft-Security-Essentials]” or a generic “[Anti-Malware”].
Trend Micro is not on the list, although an Indian vendor's AV is: “[Quick-Heal]”. Perhaps this is
a reflection of the AV market share of the region the developer is from or where the expected
target might be.
The reply to the update request coming from the server is the following:
updatc=client=\wservices.exe<BINARY>

This binary is an updated version of the main program, which will replace the older version. The
malware writes the new version to disk and starts it up.
The new malware sample has a version number 1.0.0.6 and the communication protocol is
much more comprehensive. Whereas the old one had only three commands (updatec, info, and
upsecs), this new one supports 40.
The downloader program seems to be the spearhead part of the attack, but the new version
looks like the real client. Each of the EXEs in this attack group seem to have an internal name
assigned to them. In this case, the downloader’s is DOSERS and the main client program’s is
FORYUO”. This string will later be used as a prefix of each command, perhaps to identify the
version of the client.
Once the new client starts up, it establishes again a TCP connection with the same server and
port and stays quiet. As usual, the server responds with an “info=command”, which the client
doesn’t immediately respond to. The client then sends a full info command, telling the server
more information. This is the command observed:
FORYUOR-info=user <MAC>|<hostname>|<user>|<OS>|<version>|<AV_installed>|
FORYUOR-uklog>
FORYUOR-sndps>
FORYUOR-secup>
FORYUOR-audio>
FORYUOR-usbdiv>
FORYUOR-sapp=httpscan<\Scaner\>
FORYUOR-kapp=svehost<\services\>
FORYUOR-uapp=udriver<\Drivers\>
FORYUOR-papp=servicescan<\services\>
FORYUOR-mapp=httpservice<\Windows Data\>||c:\Documents and
Settings\user\Application Data\Windows Data\
13

Trend Micro | Operation C-Major: Information Theft Campaign Targets Military Personnel in India

<MAC> refers to the MAC address of the network card used to connect. <version> refers to the
client version. In our sample, this was “Microsoft-1.0.0.6”. The rest of the fields point to the
many modular components of the attack. “uklog” refers to the keylogger binary, “sndps” to the
sound binary, “secup” to the backup client process, “audio” to the audio driver and “usbdi” to the
filestealing module. On first call, this set of commands is empty, as shown above, although the
directory paths assigned to them are already decided and set up by the client program. The
path where each of them will reside, are sent in the last few lines (the commands “sapp” (the
backup program), “kapp” (the keylogger), “uapp” (the file stealing module), “papp” (a password
stealing module not requested although the path is already set up) and “mapp” (the main
application).
The response to this message coming from the C&C server brings all the binaries that the client
has requested (keylogger, sound module, audio driver, filestealing module and backup module):

uclntn=98
uklog=loger=\svshost.exe<BINARY>
secup=client=\servicescan.exe<BINARY>
audio=mcaudio=\Naudio.dll<BINARY>
update=usbdriver=\udriver.exe<BINARY>

The TCP connection is left open and the C&C server will be sending a ping command at
specified intervals to keep it that way:
clping=Ping

Other commands supported by the 1.0.0.6 version of the clients shed more light on what the
purpose of this threat really is. Here is a list of all the commands and a brief explanation of their
functionality:









afile: Functionality not identified
audio: Updates the audio driver
clping: Sets last communication time to current time
