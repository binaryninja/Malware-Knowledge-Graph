ESET sheds light on commands used by the favorite backdoor of the Sednit group
ESET Research 22 May 2019 - 11:30AM
What happens when a victim is compromised by a backdoor and the operator is
controlling it? It’s a difﬁcult question that is not possible to answer entirely by reverse
engineering the code. In this article we will analyze commands sent by the operator to
their targets.
The Sednit group – also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy or STRONTIUM – has
been operating since at least 2004 and has made headlines frequently in past years.
Recently, we unveiled the existence of a UEFI rootkit, called LoJax, which we attribute to
the Sednit group. This is a ﬁrst for an APT group, and shows Sednit has access to very
sophisticated tools to conduct its espionage operations.
Three years ago, the Sednit group unleashed new components targeting victims in
various countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. Since then, the number and
diversity of components has increased drastically. ESET researchers and colleagues
from other companies have documented these components; however, in this article we
will focus on what’s beyond the compromise, what the operators do once a victim system
is running a Zebrocy Delphi backdoor.

The bear’s bait
At the end of August 2018, the Sednit group launched a spearphishing email campaign
where it distributed shortened URLs that delivered the ﬁrst stage of Zebrocy
components. In the past, Sednit used a similar technique for credential phishing.
However, it is unusual for the group to use this technique to deliver one of its malware
components directly. Previously, it had used exploits to deliver and execute the ﬁrst
stage malware, while in this campaign the group relied entirely on social engineering to
lure victims into running the ﬁrst part of the chain. The screenshot in Figure 1 shows Bitly
statistics for the shortened URL used in this campaign.

Figure 1. Statistics of the Bitly URL

About 20 clicks were recorded on this link in the same week that the URL was created,
and these presumably downloaded the target archive. Let’s keep in mind that this may
mean fewer than 20 potential victims, as victims may have clicked on the URL twice, or
maybe even more times, because the outcome was not what they expected… as we will
describe below.
While ESET telemetry data indicates that this URL was delivered by spearphishing
emails, we don’t have a sample of such an email. The shortened URL leads the victim to
an IP-address-based URL, where the archived payload is located.
Unfortunately, without the email message, we don’t know if there are any instructions for
the user, if there is any further social engineering, or if it relies solely on the victim’s
curiosity. The archive contains two ﬁles; the ﬁrst is an executable ﬁle, while the second is
a decoy PDF document.
Note there is a typo in the
executable’s ﬁlename; it should be
“ДОВIДНИК” instead of
“ДОВIДНIК”. Once the binary is
executed, a password prompt
dialog box opens. The result of the
password validation will always be
wrong, but after the apparent
Figure 2. Files extracted from the archive (Google Translate
validation attempt, the decoy PDF
suggests “CATALOGUE – (2018).exe” and “Order 97.pdf”
from the Ukrainian)
document is opened. That
document appears to be empty,
but the downloader, which is
written in Delphi, continues running in the background. The IP address is also used in
the URL hardcoded into the ﬁrst binary downloader.

The Stage-1 downloader will download and execute a new downloader, written in C++,
not so different from other Zebrocy downloaders. Once again this downloader is as
straightforward as the Zebrocy gang’s other downloaders. It creates an ID and it
downloads a new, interesting backdoor, (this time) written in Delphi.
As we explained in our most recent blogpost about Zebrocy, the conﬁguration of the
backdoor is stored in in the resource section and is split into four different hex-encoded,
encrypted blobs. These blobs contain the different parts of the conﬁguration.
Once the backdoor sends basic information
about its newly compromised system, the
operators take control of the backdoor and start
to send commands right away.

Figure 3. Overview of the resource section

Hence, the time between the victim running the
downloader and the operators’ ﬁrst commands
is only a few minutes.

How the bear hunts
In this section we describe in more detail the commands performed manually by the
operators through their Delphi backdoor.
The commands available are located in one of the conﬁguration blobs mentioned earlier
(the “commands” blob in Figure 3). The number of supported commands has increased
over time, with the latest version of the backdoor having more than thirty. As we did not
identify a pattern in the order which the commands are invoked, we believe the
operators are executing them manually.
The ﬁrst set of commands gathers information about the victim’s computer and
environment:
SCREENSHOT

None

SYS_INFO

None

GET_NETWORK

None

SCAN_ALL

None

The commands above are commonly executed when the operators ﬁrst connect to a
newly activated backdoor. They don’t have any arguments, and they are quite selfexplanatory. Other commands commonly seen executed shortly after these backdoors
are activated, listed below:

Those who already have read our previous articles about Zebrocy will notice that more
or less the same kind of information is sent, over and over again by previous stages.
This information is requested within a few minutes of initial compromise and the amount
of data the operator will have to deal with is quite considerable.
In order to collect even more information, from time to time the Zebrocy operators upload
and use dumpers on victims’ machines. The current dumpers have some similarities with
those previously used by the group. In this case, Yandex Browser, Chromium, 7Star
Browser (a Chromium-based browser), and CentBrowser are targeted, as well as
versions of Microsoft Outlook from 1997 through 2016:
UPLOAD_AND_EXECUTE_FILE

C:\ProgramData\Ofﬁce\MS\msofﬁce.exe
[…]
4D5A9000…

These dumpers create log ﬁles indicating the presence or absence of potential
databases to dump:
DOWNLOAD_LIST

C:\ProgramData\Ofﬁce\MS\out.txt
C:\ProgramData\Ofﬁce\MS\text.txt

The current dumper contains the following output when there are no databases to dump:
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Yandex\YandexBrowser\User Data\Default\Login Data not found
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Chromium\User Data\Default\Login Data not found
%LOCALAPPDATA%\7Star\7Star\User Data\Default\Login Data not found
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CentBrowser\User Data\Default\Login Data not found
These dumpers are quickly removed once they have done their job. Moreover, the
backdoor contains a list of ﬁlenames related to credentials from software listed below
(database names):
key3.db

Firefox private keys (now named key4.db)

cert8.db

Firefox certiﬁcate database

logins.json

Firefox encrypted password database

account.cfn

The Bat! (email client) account credentials

wand.dat

Opera password database

The operators take care of retrieving these databases if they are present on the victim’s
computer.

DOWNLOAD_LIST

%APPDATA%\The Bat!\Account.CFN
%APPDATA%\The Bat!\[REDACTED]\Account.CFN

The operators retrieve these ﬁles on the machine using the DOWNLOAD_LIST
command. This command can be used when the operators are aware of the presence of
interesting ﬁles on the computer.

Finally, depending on how interesting the victim is, they malware operators may deploy
another custom backdoor. This backdoor is executed using the CMD_EXECUTE
command:

mand

687474703A2F2F[REDACTED]
dir /s /b /o:gn %APPDATA%\Microsoft\

There are some interesting facts here. First, they use COM object hijacking to make the
malware persistent on the system even though the custom backdoor is installed only for
a few hours. Second, the hex-encoded string is the C&C used by the custom backdoor
while in the Delphi backdoor the C&C is embedded in the conﬁguration.
The two Delphi backdoors, the common one and the one above, are quite similar but
contain these interesting tweaks:
Delphi compiler version

14.0-15.0

32.0

32/64-bit

32-bit

64-bit

Conﬁguration location

section

no conﬁg (C&C is passed as an
argument)

Number of commands

5

3

Encryption algorithm

AES ECB

custom

Lifetime on the
computer

a few days

a few hours

Once again, it’s not very clear what the purpose of this custom backdoor is. The
detection ratio is deﬁnitely lower in comparison to the “usual” backdoor. The very short
timeframe where this backdoor is on the system and operating makes it harder to
retrieve. Once its operators complete their evil deeds, they quickly remove it.

Observing commands used in the wild by the operator is quite interesting. They are
gathering a considerable amount of information on the compromised target and they are
not worried about duplicated data. It shows a large gap between the development
strategy and what operators do in practice. Backdoors with custom conﬁguration and
modules are deployed very carefully, which indicates some precautions to avoid ending
up in the hands of researchers.
The ﬁrst set of commands is the same and executed during a very short timeframe,
which raises another question: is it automated?
