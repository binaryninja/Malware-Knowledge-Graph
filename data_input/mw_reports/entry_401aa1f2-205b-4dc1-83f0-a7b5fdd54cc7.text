EDITOR'S NOTE
H ARDIK MODI Senior Director, Threat Intelligence

The global cyber threat landscape continues to evolve,
unleashing increasingly sophisticated and persistent attack
techniques at internet scale. Today, attackers can release
enormous terabit-per-second-scale DDoS attacks, while
state-sponsored APT groups accelerate activity and
traditional crimeware activity continues to proliferate.
We have actively monitored this space since 2007, when the company launched Active Threat
Level Analysis System (ATLAS®), which collects, analyzes, prioritizes, and disseminates data on
emerging threats to enable the generation of actionable intelligence for consumption by people
and systems alike. Through telemetry on a massive scale, ATLAS delivers unparalleled visibility
into the backbone networks at the core of the internet. Organizations (including 90 percent of
Tier 1 service providers) share statistics representing approximately one-third of all internet
traffic. NETSCOUT correlates this and other data sets to provide automated data sharing and
intelligence, facilitating usage by all internet users, business and private, giving them a broader
perspective to better understand and react to the threats they face. ATLAS’ reputation allows
for collaboration or automated data sharing with nearly 70 percent of the world’s Computer
Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).
ATLAS’ internet-scale visibility is further enhanced by analysis from our ASERT team.
For more than a decade, ASERT’s world-class security researchers and analysts have been
building the tools and front-line database to analyze malware at internet scale. The security
intelligence professionals on ASERT are part of a group of experts that are referred to as
‘super remediators’ and represent the best in information security practices and threat
intelligence. ASERT provides operationally viable threat intelligence to thousands of network
operator customers via automatic, in-band security feeds. The group contributes to dozens
of operational security councils and is a founding member of the Red Sky Alliance, as well
as being a member of the Cyber Threat Alliance. ASERT also has working relationships with
hundreds of international CERTs.
By using ATLAS’ internet-scale visibility in conjunction with more tactical holdings such as
automated malware analysis pipelines, sinkholes, scanners, and honeypots, and supplemented
by open-source intelligence data sets and ASERT analysis, we can provide a unique view into
the threat landscape, demonstrated by a steady stream of discoveries. This report represents
our view of the threat landscape, based on all our holdings and driven by analysis from our
intelligence unit.

new performance enhancements, and apply
smart business techniques to vastly
accelerate attack growth rate.
IoT devices were attacked within five minutes of being plugged into the internet.
Malware authors not only built more advanced devices, but also applied their
learnings from IoT botnet manipulation to target new areas such as commodity Linux
servers using malware like Mirai. Malicious actors, criminal organizations, and even
individuals busily diversified malware tools and families, attack vectors, and distribution
channels — all aimed at an expanding array of targets. Meanwhile, nation-state
advanced persistent threat (APT) group activity ratcheted up in volume and targets.
Here are a few highlights of the major trends that we observed.

C OUN T DO W N T O AT TA CK
Constant targets of DDoS malware, IoT devices are now under attack five minutes
after being plugged in and targeted by specific exploits within 24 hours. IoT security
is minimal to nonexistent on many devices, making this an increasingly dangerous and
vulnerable sector as now everything from life-saving medical devices and equipment
to home security systems and cars are IoT-equipped.

NE T SCOUT Threat Intelligence

T HE ‘ T ER ROR BI T AT TA CK ’ A ND BE Y OND
February and March of 2018 marked the first reported terabit attacks.
While the second half of 2018 didn’t reveal new attacks at that volume,
it is likely due to systemic changes to counter the Memcached vulnerability
and the fact that other vectors didn’t emerge. Overall attack numbers were
up 26 percent, while those in the 100–400 Gbps range exploded, showing
continued interest and maturity of tooling in this midrange. It’s only a matter
of time before new vulnerabilities drive attacks at the higher end again.

N AT ION -S TAT E INNO VAT ION
Activity from key nation-state actors such as China, Russia, Iran, and
North Korea showed no sign of ebbing. New groups emerged, while known
entities updated and evolved their tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs), combining custom tools with commodity crimeware to further extend
their reach. We noted continued innovation from groups, such as the use of
Chrome extensions to enable persistence in the STOLEN PENCIL campaign.

We saw a robust marketplace driven by well-stocked innovation pipelines
from rapidly growing organizations. If this sounds like a business story, that’s
because it is. The cybercriminal underground operates much like a legitimate
business on the right side of the law, with the huge proviso that cybercrime
organizations cause billions of dollars in damage and negatively impact major
enterprises and governments.
For instance, campaigns such as DanaBot use an affiliate model that
distributes labor to specialists and moves away from the more inefficient
method of managing the entire process in house. While this was popularized
a few years ago with exploit kits like Angler, DanaBot has taken it to the next
level by rapidly establishing its presence across the globe with 12 separate
affiliates targeting financial institutions in many countries. Can a B-school
case study write-up be far behind?

ADVANCED THREAT
The ATLAS Security and Engineering Research Team (ASERT) tracked
approximately 35 APT groups around the globe in the latter half of
2018. These groups targeted verticals such as academia, government,
and finance across the Middle East; the United States; Central and
South America; and East and Southeast Asia. While the groups varied
in sophistication, targeting, and TTPs, we saw the continued
emergence of numerous groups on a worldwide basis.

APT GROUPS
IN 2H 2018

APT groups not only grew in number, but also in sophistication. Nation
states continually added additional facets of cyber espionage to their toolkit,
including new targeting methods. They used methods such as a unified
extensible firmware interface (UEFI) rootkit known as LoJax and a browser
plugin first utilized by a suspected North Korean group. In addition to
uncovering previously unknown operations and researching new campaigns
and methods, ASERT tracked dozens of APT groups and their activity across
the internet using ATLAS®.

CHINA
Exfiltration of intellectual property via human
and cyber means has been a fundamental component
of China’s modernization. It still is carried out
by Chinese APT groups, despite the fact that China
has the means to purchase any patents or companies
that it desires.
The majority of what ASERT observed in 2H 2018 centered on geopolitical and
strategic intelligence gathering, including a highly publicized hotel breach.

Leviathan or
TEMP.Periscope

Stone Panda,
APT10, or Menupass

Emissary Panda
or Lucky Mouse

Highly engaged in the South China
Sea, this group is very interested in
both military and commercial regional
activity, targeting countries and
organizations that monitor or transit the
area. Maritime, defense, and logistics
industries are commonly targeted along
with in-region countries, including a
recent attack targeting Cambodia.1

Associated with the Ministry of State
Security (MSS), this group targets
managed service providers (MSPs)
as a conduit to accessing sensitive
information in a variety of industries,
especially in Japan. They play a long
game of careful reconnaissance
followed by intrusion into service
organizations in order to gain access
to the actual target, which enables
them to target entire supply chains
and industries. ASERT observed a large
spike in activity against logistics and
government targets in July and August
2018, lending further credence to their
long-game tactics.

This group focuses heavily on
diplomats and embassies and has
targeted central Asian governments
for at least most of 2018 by accessing
a common data center. The group
utilized that access to turn government
websites into watering holes to lure
additional victims. The diplomatic
targeting is historically related to
Central and Western Asia’s political
climate. Because of the nature of the
group’s TTPs, victims often range across
verticals such as government, academia,
and finance in addition to the primary
targets of diplomats and embassies.

Leviathan suspected of using
a variety of tools such as
Responder, NetBIOS Poisoning
Tool, and exploitation
methods like ETERNALBLUE.
The use of these tools came
only after they’d been made
public, showcasing this
groups preference to
“live off the land”.2

Emissary Panda spotted
utilizing an in-memory
C++ Trojan that listens
for incoming connections
from the C2 along with
injecting C2 traffic into
an RDP port.3 The group used
a proxy tool, signed using
a stolen certificate, to
drop the trojan.

IRAN
From ASERT’s perspective, Iranian APT groups appeared
to continue on steadily, although changes in their
targeting sometimes made them more or less visible.
They continued to develop and evolve their malware, heavily target their neighbors, and
closely monitor Iranians (both in-country and out). They also targeted the usual sectors
for intelligence value: aerospace, technology, and governments, among others.

Dark Hydrus
This APT group is a relative newcomer (first observed in the summer of 2018) that
typically targets governments in the Middle East, but ASERT also observed financial
institutions in Asia being targeted. ASERT found a significant overlap in the indicators
of compromise (IoCs) in these verticals, suggesting that the same TTPs were used.
Dark Hydrus added a number of anti-analysis/anti-sandbox checks
to a malware family called RogueRobin4. While anti-analysis checks
are not new, the adversary included a large number of checks that
include known sandbox names, RAM & CPU size/number, and instructions
to look for known analysis tools like Wireshark and SysInternals.

NE T SCOUT Threat Intelligence

Charming Kitten or NEWSCASTER
This group is known to target and masquerade as legitimate
companies. ASERT noted an explosion in this group’s
infrastructure, with the usual themes: mimicry of legitimate
software as well as doppelgängers of legitimate companies.
In this mix, ASERT observed doppelgänger domains for
aerospace, industrial vehicles, and technology companies,
as well as for some non-profit entities in Saudi Arabia.
Charming Kitten ASERT’s research led us to
discover a legacy C2 pointing to an active
or re-activated Cobalt-Strike server.

Chafer
A third Iranian group ASERT tracked predominantly targets the
airline industry with both commodity and custom malware. Specific
targets include companies that support the airline industry, such as
technology and telecom companies, engineering consultants, and
even administrative support contractors. While public reporting noted
this group’s activity in the Middle East, ASERT also observed activity
in the United States, Southeast Asia, and South America.

OilRig, APT34 or Helix Kitten
This group continues to evolve its capabilities as noted in a
September 2018 blog post ASERT published highlighting changes
to BONDUPDATER, a PowerShell-based Trojan that now obfuscates
the data prior to exfiltration. ASERT managed to capture live
command-and-control (C2) communications from this group and
reverse engineer the communication protocols the malware used.5
We primarily observed the group actively targeting government
and technology industries.
Oilrig continues to evolve a custom PowerShell
DNS tunnel, BONDUPDATER, a backdoor tool (2017–2018).
Analysis of the protocol can be found on the
ASERT blog here.

RUSSIA
Russian APT operations largely target government
or government-affiliated networks.
Specifically in the following areas:
• Geopolitical workings of its neighboring states
• Western, NATO, and democratic encroachment in Eastern Europe
and the military campaign in Syria
• Russian annexation of the Crimea in Ukraine
• Espionage operations against major players of interest
ASERT also tracked some disinformation domains of known Russian origin,
which tend to rise and fall as current events and priorities change. Russia stands
accused of meddling in the elections of up to 27 countries over the past decade.
Bloomberg reports that European Union officials are already bracing for Russian
cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns ahead of the spring 2019 elections
of its member states.
Fancy Bear is using
multiple languages to
write the same tools.
Zebrocy, a downloader and
backdoor tool, has been
seen writing in Delphi,
C#, VB.NET, Go.6
Cannon, a custom emailbased C2 channel leveraged
by the group, is written
in both C# and Delphi.7
Fancy Bear’s double agent
LoJax UEFI writing module
was found in the wild by
ESET researchers.8

8

Fancy Bear, APT28, or Sednit
This APT group employed legitimate UEFI rootkit software to establish a backdoor
on victim machines. The malicious files, originally classified as “unwanted software”
by anti-virus vendors, avoided detection by minimally tweaking the software to
phone home to the attacker C2 servers without changing any functionality within the
software itself. Notably, systems compromised by LoJax could also be monitored in
real time by the group. The nature of the hijacked software allowed the geo-location
of the infected machine.
This type of targeting serves the purpose of potentially finding and following
high-value targets and gaining access to potentially sensitive materials on
compromised computers. ASERT tracked the infrastructure using custom fingerprints
and identified live, active attacker controlled C2 servers. We found this group heavily
targeting government entities around the world. In October, the U.S. Department of
Justice issued indictments against members of this group, claiming that: “…beginning
in or around December 2014 and continuing until at least May 2018, the conspiracy
conducted persistent and sophisticated computer intrusions affecting U.S. persons,
corporate entities, international organizations, and their respective employees located
around the world, based on their strategic interest to the Russian government.”

VIETNAM
First seen in 2012, Vietnamese APT operators
have flown below the radar until recently.
Vietnam currently has at least three APT groups,
two of which are rarely seen operating beyond
Vietnam’s neighbors.
Targeting activity suggests espionage motivations and the desire to gain insight into
strategic foreign relations. Tension in the South China Sea drives a substantial portion
of the espionage activity, particularly around the Spratly Islands. China, Taiwan,
Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam all occupy some portion of the islands and lay
claim to the area.

Ocean Lotus or APT32
The most visible and well-known of the Vietnamese APT groups, Ocean Lotus updates
TTPs frequently and uses increasingly sophisticated tradecraft and customized malware.
Analyzing a number of the group’s malware samples and phishing campaigns, ASERT
found that they often showcased themes designed to target foreign governments of
Southeast Asia, dissidents, journalists, and anyone with business or strategic interests
in Vietnam. Most interesting, however, was that ASERT saw substantial internal
activity where Vietnamese victim machines attempted to phone home to a known
C2 infrastructure owned by Ocean Lotus, suggesting the group also focuses on
internal targeting.

PoisonVine, APT-C-01, or PoisonIvy Group

PoisonVine utilizes RATs that
can detect the presence of
anti-virus based upon how the
AV simulates the windows API
call 'GetClientRect'.9

Active for years, this group specializes in conducting cyber espionage campaigns
against key national Chinese agencies, including defense, government, science,
technology, academic, and maritime. The group primarily focuses on the military
industry, Chinese strategic relations, cross-strait issues with Taiwan and China,
and ocean-related fields. ASERT observed additional activity targeting government,
academic, finance, and non-profit sectors.

DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE’S
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
While primarily motivated by intelligence
gathering and intellectual property theft,
North Korean APT groups are also known for
destruction and fundraising to support the
regime, which is rather rare among APT groups.

STOLEN PENCIL Campaign
As reported in a December 2018 blog post, ASERT discovered a campaign of
probable DPRK-origin targeting universities.10 ASERT saw massive credential
theft across four universities, where all of the compromised targets were in the
mechanical engineering field and focused on biomedical research. One victim
was a member of a Pacific-region policy non-profit. ASERT research uncovered
a far-reaching campaign resulting in ongoing collaboration with industry
professionals around the world.
DPRK utilized a browser plugin in the STOLEN PENCIL
campaign, going so far as to leave reviews on the
plugin from compromised accounts in a likely effort
to establish legitimacy.

10

CRIMEWARE
Financially motivated threat actors rely on crimeware: malware
intended to loot the victim’s bank account or steal victim data
to exploit for money. For crimeware actors, the key word is more:
more groups, more attack monetization, more businesslike methods,
and certainly more

and better

tools. We are seeing new attacks

from additional groups, often using increasingly sophisticated and
persistent malware coupled with innovative techniques that target
an expanded set of targets.

• Once plugged in to the internet, IoT devices are attacked within five minutes

actors and substantially increases the pool of potential victims across the world.
• The overall lifetime of crimeware infections sometimes lasts years, long after
an infrastructure goes offline.

CRIMEWARE HIGHLIGHTS
Crimeware actors
primarily deliver
malicious code via
weaponized emails
containing either
booby-trapped documents
or classic social
engineering.

In late 2018, we saw a growing array of crimeware morph into modularized
frameworks, adding functionality to increase the monetization of infection
beyond a simple smash-and-grab. Common modules include spam delivery,
password theft, or cryptocurrency mining. Much like the old story of the
camel with its head in the tent, that first successful incursion into a victim’s
machine is only the initial step. More often than not, cyber adversaries
use the original foothold as an avenue to leverage many different malware
payloads to further infect and exploit their victims.
Crimeware families wax and wane in popularity as features become available
and infrastructure changes hands in underground marketplaces (Figure 1).
Among the hundreds of malware families tracked by ASERT, we observed
spikes in families like IcedID, often delivered by Emotet, and DanaBot,
a modular malware framework first discovered in May 2018.11 Simultaneously,
we observed a significant decrease in established families like Panda Banker,
an offshoot of the classic Zeus malware family.

CR IME WA R E G OE S T O B -S CHOOL
As shown in a December blog post, the DanaBot crimeware family
exemplifies the criminal underground’s increasing tendency to operate
like a regular business. For crimeware operators to make money, they
need to distribute their malware as widely as possible, maintain a C2
infrastructure, and cash out by converting banking credentials to hard
cash. Each of these requires a separate skill set, creating an opportunity
for threat actors to provide specialized services to the underground.

While the DanaBot authors maintain the centralized C2 infrastructure,
they outsource the distribution of the malware to third-party affiliates.
The affiliate model works using a tokenization method that allows
the owners to maintain oversight on the botnet. The affiliates handle
malware installation and cashing out, accepting the bulk of the
risk themselves.
This affiliate model promotes a much broader reach of potential
victims. With the distribution of labor, threat actors no longer need
to single-handedly target bank accounts in multiple countries.
By outsourcing installation of the malware via affiliates, DanaBot
gained a global foothold in the latter half of 2018 (Figure 3).

CR IME WA R E : NO E X PIR AT ION D AT E
Malware infections tend to fester long past their official expiration dates.
For example, the Neverquest banking Trojan officially ended in 2017 when
authorities shut down this once-thriving criminal enterprise. And yet, it’s still
out there. A malware sinkhole ASERT maintains continues to see almost 2,000
daily check-ins to Neverquest C2 sites that we registered prior to Neverquest’s
demise (Figure 4). As remediation or forced attrition eliminates the threat
from victim machines, over time the number of infections has declined.
The longevity of these malware infections requires security defenders to
remain vigilant long after the apparent threat subsides. Though we’ve yet
to uncover adversaries registering expired domains to capitalize on ongoing
infections, it is possible that attackers have leveraged this tactic, gaining
easy access to sensitive data.

THE TOP SOURCE
COUNTRIES OF BRUTE-FORCE
IoT ACTIVITY

IoT
IoT devices are constant targets of DDoS malware. They can sit for months in
a warehouse or on a store shelf, waiting to be brought home and plugged into
a network. Once they are plugged in, our research shows IoT devices will be
targeted with a brute-force attack of common backdoor usernames and passwords
within five minutes. Within hours, they will be subject to common exploits.12
We use our global network of IoT honeypots to monitor brute-force and exploit
activity. Brute-forcing happens when IoT malware continuously attacks random targets
via the antiquated Telnet protocol, running through lists of common factory-default
usernames and passwords until they succeed and can deliver the malware to the victim
device. The top source countries of brute-force IoT activity are Russia, China, Brazil,
and the United States.
As highlighted in an October 2018 blog post, we’ve compiled a list of the most
common username and password combinations used by IoT malware (Figure 6).
While there is some regional affinity, the list is composed exclusively of hardcoded
credentials for many common classes of IoT devices, such as web-enabled cameras
and home routers.13
Mirai remains the king of IoT malware. Since the authors of Mirai released the source
code in late 2016, threat actors tweaked the infection mechanisms by adding new
usernames/passwords and exploits, as well as DDoS attack techniques.

REMAINS THE KING
OF IoT MALWARE

TORii

ARE TWO NEW BREEDS
OF ADVANCED IoT BOTS

Figure 6: Common Username and Password Combinations

IoT M A LWA R E T R E ND S
There are two trends in IoT malware we’ve seen in the latter half of 2018.
First, there are several particularly interesting tactics hidden within the
onslaught of Mirai variants. Earlier in the year, we saw an advanced threat
actor use a malware named VPNFilter to target specific home routers.
It was delivered in multiple stages with a modularized payload, a level of
sophistication not seen before in IoT malware.
We also observed Torii, which like VPNFilter, is a part of a new breed of
advanced IoT bots that deviate from using Mirai as its framework. Instead, Torii
leverages a dropper to install and establish persistence, an unusual technique for
IoT bots. Torii uses its own encryption scheme to communicate with its C2 and uses
TCP port 443 as an evasion tactic. While most IoT botnets ship with pre-canned
DDoS attacks, Torii focuses on data exfiltration. Torii is also built to be modular in
nature, as it contains the ability to download files and execute remote commands.
Secondly, threat actors are learning from their experience with IoT malware to
target known vulnerabilities on Linux servers in the data center. For instance, the
Hadoop YARN vulnerability was initially used to deliver DemonBot, a DDoS malware,
to IoT devices. Soon after, threat actors used the vulnerability to install Mirai on
Linux servers, blurring the line between IoT and server malware.

busy and ever-more organized community
of bad actors. The latter half of 2018
saw everything from state actors trying
to influence geopolitical processes to
an increasingly businesslike DDoS
service-for-hire community.
In turn, that has led to a skyrocketing diversification of attack avenues, methods,
and techniques, wiping away traditional expectations around both DDoS attack
mechanisms and defense practices. Gone are the days where a single bot offered a
simplistic DDoS attack type. In today’s DDoS threat landscape, attackers increasingly
add diversification into their bots, allowing for a wide variation of attacks and
protocols to take down networks.

DDoS ATTACK TRENDS
In this potent new strategy, threat
actors launched strategic campaigns
that compromised and used a vast
array of devices related solely by
internet connectivity.

Although the number of
DDoS attacks increased
year over year by about
26 percent, the dominant

In our estimation, the increases across
such a wide range llikely reflect the
continued monetization of the threat
landscape. As DDoS-for-hire grows
in accessibility and affordability, we
expect Booter/Stresser services to
further proliferate and diversify. While
these tools are not necessarily new, the
ease of access, quick iteration of new
attack types, and a broader range of
international customers will result in lots
of amateur cybercriminals getting hold
of destructive malware. And it will result
in a wider array of organizations being
targeted for any number of reasons.
Law-enforcement action against such
services and their users, as we’ve seen
recently, are the main counterbalance
to their otherwise inexorable rise.

While we continued to see a steady
uptick in attacks greater than 400

second-half data from 2017
to 2018 for the top ten
most-targeted sectors, we
found significant shifts
in targets and an overall
growth in attack size

It’s not surprising to find that telecommunications providers observed the
overwhelming majority of attacks, as did data hosting services (which includes cloud
providers). This is inherent to their role as connectivity providers, with attacks focused
on their residential and business subscribers as well as their operational infrastructures.
However, there were some variations year over year that illustrated the ongoing
increase in attack size, as well as a rising line of attack numbers for a diverse range
of vertical sectors.
The top two most attacked targets all experienced significant increases in attack
numbers, while the max attack size decreased for Wired Telecommunications Carriers
and Telecommunications by 10 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, Data
Processing, Hosting, and Related Services (including cloud providers) saw an 83 percent
increase in the number of attacks year over year, as well as a 198 percent increase in
max attack size. With cloud service providers hosting an increasingly large amount
of valuable data, this makes sense. On the other hand, wireless telecommunications
carriers actually saw a decrease of 29 percent in attack numbers.
The sub-vertical sector Custom Computer Programming Services — which includes
system integrators and consulting houses — saw a 198 percent increase in attack
numbers. Meanwhile, its max size attack of 186.2 Gbps was 1,043 percent larger
than in 2017.

DDoS HIGHLIGHTS
C A R PE T BOMBING
The majority of DDoS attacks are launched using attack vectors which have been
around for a long time. As the majority of enterprises (and even some internet
service providers) lack even the most rudimentary DDoS protection, a 15-year-old
attack like TCP SYN flood, or a simple NTP reflection flood, is sufficient to take these
organizations offline.
However, as attackers often focus on high impact targets that take DDoS defense
seriously, they constantly evolve new attack vectors designed to bypass or take
advantage of limitations or vulnerabilities in traditional DDoS defense solutions.
One of the attack vectors we’ve seen used since November 2017 is carpet bombing.
This is a new variant of the more common reflection, or flooding, attacks. Instead
of focusing the attack on a single destination, the attacker targets every destination
within a specific subnet or CIDR block (for example, a /20). Doing so makes it harder to
detect and mitigate the attacks, and the flood of attack traffic across network devices
and internal links can potentially cause outages. These attacks are often fragmented,
resulting in a flood of non-initial IP fragments (Figure 9). This will often happen when
the attacker is using UDP reflection attacks. This results in an attack that can be tricky
to mitigate as the non-initial fragments don’t contain any information from the UDP
header, such as the source port used in the attack.

to another, complicating the detection and mitigation even further.

When it comes to mitigation, carpet bombing attacks use traditional DDoS
reflection type attacks or flooding attacks, and can be mitigated using the
same approaches:
• Traffic from unwanted source ports can be dropped or rate-limited using
infrastructure access lists (IACL) or FlowSpec.
• T he source IPs producing the attacks can be blocked using iACLs, FlowSpec
or source-based, remote-triggered blackholing (S/RTBH).

• Non-initial fragments can usually be safely rate-limited down to low values

• Attack traffic can be diverted to IDMSs but care must be taken to not divert
too large a chunk of the attack traffic. The total traffic (both legitimate and
attack traffic) can be quite large when entire network blocks are diverted.

Detecting carpet bombing attacks requires a slightly different technique. Traditional
flow-based detection that focuses on specific destination IP addresses will usually
not work, as the attack traffic will be spread across all IP addresses in the networks
under attack. Instead, companies must analyze traffic volumes crossing network
boundaries or traversing specific network devices as this will show the broader
attack volume. Network traffic should therefore be profiled and average volumes
measured on a regular basis to understand what normal traffic volumes look like,
including typical spikes within them. These attacks can also be detected by profiling
traffic to groups of resources or larger subnets within the network and then
detecting anomalies over this traffic.

(1 percent). For DNS replies, an exemption should be made for each DNS recursive
infrastructure to avoid blocking large ENDS0 replies. This can in some cases block
up to 50 percent of the attack volume when dealing with fragmented attack traffic.

Everybody knows the benefits of a diversified stock portfolio — it minimizes risk
while providing more than one revenue-generating avenue. The same principle can
apply to DDoS attacks, and it seems that many in the Booter/Stresser community are
doing just that. We saw a significant increase in both attack volume and size across
a slew of less widely used attack types, as it appears that attackers branched out
from the usual culprits like DNS, NTP, and Chargen (Figure 10). Nine out of 14 attack
types showed a significant increase in number of attacks. The number of mDNS
amplification attacks, for example, rose 233 percent, while the maximum size attack
increased from 8.28 Gbps to 186 Gbps. At the same time the aforementioned attacks
all declined in both attack numbers and max size. However, SSDP, another perennial
favorite, bucked the decline tide with a 55 percent growth in numbers. That could
well be due to the arrival of a new class of SSDP attack discovered by ASERT in 2018.1
All told, this looks to us like a case of a growing community of professional DDoS-forhire services finding ways to minimize risk and optimize ROI.

After posting research on MedusaHTTP DDoS, a botnet from a hacker
known as stevenkings,13 the ASERT team was able to assist the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during an investigation that ultimately
led to charges being filed.14 Such collaborative cybercrime-fighting
efforts are on the rise. For example, in December 2018, international
crime-fighting agencies joined forces with the FBI to take down 15
DDoS-for-hire services, charging three men with criminal hacking in the
process.2 In April, a group of agencies worked with the Dutch police to
take down webstresser, the world’s largest DDoS-for-hire service. The
effect was immediate, as researchers attributed an immediate decrease
in DNS amplification attacks to the demise of thisorganization.10
These are just the latest in a series of operations from western
governments and authorities designed to clamp down on
cybercriminals and nation-state actors. Moreover, courts are
increasingly responding with jail time for cybercriminals like
Daniel Kaye, a hacker who launched a Mirai-based botnet attack that
ultimately crashed large sections of the internet in Liberia in 2016.12

The ASERT team was
able to assist the FBI
during an investigation
that ultimately led
to charges being filed
against a hacker known as
stevenkings.

We expect that such actions against malicious actors will increase
in 2019 as Western nations build on this collaborative effort to fight
cybercrime. This will also rely on collaboration with private sector
information security professionals such as the ASERT team.

NE T SCOUT Threat Intelligence

CONCLUSION
The overall threat landscape
is simultaneously lawless
and frighteningly efficient.
In the second half of
2018, we saw threat actors
building crimeware that was
cheaper and easier to deploy
and more persistent once
installed. At the same time,
many groups applied business
best practices that further
extended the reach of
attacks, while making it even
easier for their customers
to access and leverage
malicious software and
DDoS attack tools.

28

Meanwhile, nation-state APT groups continued to proliferate across
the globe, attacking financial institutions, governments, academia, and
telecommunications companies, just for starters. Capable of affecting
national elections and crippling online access, the threat posed by these
groups increased daily.
Moreover, these groups attacked across the entire threat spectrum, as
attackers took advantage of increasingly effective tools and techniques
and an ever-lower barrier to entry. Attack vectors that were once confined
to sophisticated actors are now available from attackers for hire, widening
their reach and ability to damage private and public sector organizations.
Actors that once relied on closely guarded custom tools became just as
efficient "living off the land." And these attacks generally increased in size,
as bad actors of all types unleashed attacks that often involved hundreds of
thousands — or even millions — of victims who largely served to amplify the
attack or ended up as collateral damage. And in the strategic sphere, those
large-scale campaigns were often aimed at highly selected targets.
Further, the internet-scale paradigm changed the frontiers for where attacks
can be launched, observed, and interdicted. Global threats will require global
interventions, involving enterprises, service providers, and governments.
This is an enormously complex scenario and solving it will involve
coordinated efforts across the public and private sector on a global scale.
Organizations must also regularly evaluate and update security technologies
and techniques. The ASERT team will continue to monitor the threat
landscape and report on new groups and malware under development,
as well as updated techniques. Although it is difficult to be fully prepared
for any incoming threat, regular consumption and application of threat
intelligence is an important preparatory safeguard, as doing so provides
insight to inform both strategic direction and areas to address technically.
