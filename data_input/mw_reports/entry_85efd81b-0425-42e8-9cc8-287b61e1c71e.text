North Korean hackers are suspected of launching a cyber-attack on some of the most
important government offices in the US and South Korea in recent days, including the White
House, the Pentagon, the New York Stock Exchange and the presidential Blue House in
Seoul.
The attack took out some of South Korea's most important websites, including those of the
Blue House, the defence ministry, the national assembly, Shinhan bank, Korea Exchange
bank and the top internet portal Naver.
Ahn Jeong-eun, a spokeswoman for Korea Information Security Agency, said the websites of
11 organisations had either gone down or had access problems.
The Associated Press reported that the White House, Pentagon and New York Stock
Exchange were also targeted, but apparently deflected the electronic barrage. South Korea's
Yonhap news agency said military intelligence officers were looking into the possibility that
the attack may have been carried out by North Korean hackers and pro-North Korea forces
in the South.
It resembles an attack that began last Saturday on government websites in the US, including
some that are responsible for fighting cyber-crime.
John Bumgarner, director of research at the US Cyber Consequences Unit, said: "There's
been a lot chatter recently about cyber-war. The North Koreans may have felt they were not
getting enough attention launching missiles so they moved into another potential warfare â€“
cyber. It's a form of sabre rattling. But the big question is, did the North Koreans launch it
themselves or did someone do it for them?"
Yang Moo-jin, a professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies, said he doubted
whether the North had the capability to knock down the websites.
But Hong Hyun-ik, an analyst at the Sejong Institute thinktank, said the attack could have
been carried out by either North Korea or China, saying he "heard North Korea has been
working hard to hack into" South Korean networks.
South Korea's National Intelligence Service told a group of politicians today that it believes
that North Korea or its sympathisers were behind the attacks, a source at the meeting told
Associated Press.
The agency refused to comment, but it confirmed it was working with US authorities to
investigate the attack. It said it believed the attack was thoroughly prepared and committed
"at the level of a certain organisation or state".
The attacks appeared to be linked to problems on the US sites, although investigators were
still unsure who was behind them, Ahn said.

In the US, the treasury department, secret service, Federal Trade Commission and transport
department websites were all down at varying points over the 4 July holiday weekend. Some
of the sites were still experiencing problems last night.
The website of the Washington Post was also affected. Its computer security writer Brian
Krebs blamed "malicious software" that ordered infected PCs to repeatedly visit targeted
websites. A large proportion of the PCs involved were located in South Korea, he reported.
An initial investigation in South Korea found that many personal computers were infected
with a virus ordering them to visit official websites in South Korea and the US at the same
time, the Korean information agency official Shin Hwa-su said.
The US homeland security department confirmed that officials had received reports of
"malicious web activity" and said they were investigating. Two government officials confirmed
that the treasury and secret service sites had been brought down, and said the agencies
were working with their internet service provider to resolve the problem.
Ben Rushlo, director of internet technologies at the website monitoring company Keynote
Systems, called it a "massive outage".
Denial of service attacks against websites are not uncommon, and are usually caused when
sites are deluged with internet traffic to take them offline. Documenting cyber-attacks against
government sites is difficult, and depends heavily on how agencies characterise an incident
and how successful or damaging it is.
