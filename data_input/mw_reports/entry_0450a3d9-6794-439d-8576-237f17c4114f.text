New Mirai Variant Launches 54 Hour DDoS Attack against
US College

March 29, 2017

Update (3/30/2017):
Following a media inquiry, we drilled down into our data and discovered that 56 percent of
all IPs used in the attack belonged to DVRs manufactured by the same vendor. We have
contacted the vendor with an offer to share our information and assist with resolving the
issue.
Since the Mirai malware was discovered last August, we’ve seen it used in a number of
high profile DDoS attacks, including the September assault on cybersecurity expert Brian
Krebs and October’s takedown of Dyn DNS services.
Given the success of those attacks, along with the public availability of the Mirai source
code, it was clearly only a matter of time before botnet herders began experimenting with
new versions of the malware.
Last December, we wrote about a variant that exploited a TR-069 network router protocol
vulnerability to infect TalkTalk Telecom home routers. And earlier this year we saw the
emergence of a repurposed Windows botnet capable of spreading Mirai bots to Linux
systems.
One thing the above variants have in common is they’ve mostly been used to launch
network layer DDoS attacks. A few weeks ago, however, what could be another version of
Mirai–this one more adept at launching application layer assaults–popped up on our radar.

Attack Description
The attack, which started on February 28 and ran for 54 hours straight, targeted one of our
customers, a US college.
The average traffic flow came in at over 30,000 RPS and peaked at around 37,000 RPS—
the most we’ve seen out of any Mirai botnet. In total, the attack generated over 2.8 billion
requests.

Based on a number of signature factors, including header order, header values and traffic
sources, our client classification system immediately identified that the attack emerged from
a Mirai-powered botnet.
Our research showed that the pool of attacking devices included those commonly used by
Mirai, including CCTV cameras, DVRs and routers. While we don’t know for sure, open
telnet (23) ports and TR-069 (7547) ports on these devices might indicate that they were
exploited by known vulnerabilities.
We also noticed that the DDoS bots used in the attack were hiding behind different useragents than the five hardcoded in the default Mirai version. This–and the size of the attack
itself–led us to believe that we might be dealing with a new variant, which was modified to
launch more elaborate application layer attacks.
Overall, in the course of the attack, we spotted the following 30 user-agent variants:

We also saw attack traffic originating from 9,793 IPs worldwide:

Less than a day after the initial assault ended, another one began that lasted for an hour
and a half with an average traffic flow of 15,000 RPS.
Based on our experience, we expect to see several more bursts before the offender(s)
finally give up on their efforts.

Afterthoughts
Ever since the Mirai source code was made public last year, we’ve seen offenders continue
to evolve the malware’s capabilities to expand its range and launch more elaborate and
impactful assaults.
Looking at the bigger picture, this variant of Mirai might be a symptom of the increased
application layer DDoS attack activity we saw in the second half of 2016.
That said, with over 90 percent of all application layer assaults lasting under six hours, an
attack of this duration stands in a league of its own.
