Penetration and Distribution Method of Gwisin Attacker
asec.ahnlab.com/en/41565/
November 10, 2022

The attacker of Gwisin ransomware targets and penetrates the publicly available servers of companies. They then
use the server as their foothold for distributing the ransomware into the internal infrastructure. It is known that the
attacker uses various means such as SFTP, WMI, integrated management solution, and IIS web service to distribute
the ransomware into the internal infrastructure. In this confirmed case, they used the IIS web service to distribute
Gwisin ransomware.
How Gwisin Attacker Penetrates a Server
Unlike other attackers who use spear phishing, watering hole, and other known methods to dominate a PC and obtain
administrator privilege to propagate the virus into a target company’s internal network systems, the Gwisin threat
actor directly performs the web hacking attack to penetrate into the web servers. As such, companies must check for
web vulnerabilities and fortify the security of connected DBs to defend against web hacking attacks.
It appears that the attacker attempts to steal system account info prior to distributing the ransomware. They scan and
perform SQL injection attack on publicly-exposed web servers.
Among the traces of the attack, an attack code of SQL Injection, written for use against an MS SQL server, was found
in a Linux server. This hints that the attacker is indiscriminately attacking the servers using automated offense tools.

It has been confirmed that the attacker uses WebShell following after a successful attack on a web server. Some
cases involve WebShell inserted into a PHP file. In other cases, independent WebShell files were created. However,
the techniques of inserting WebShell code into the existing file or uploading the file have not yet been identified.

Additionally, the attacker uses a Reverse Shell code written with Python to establish a reverse connection. It was
discovered that the attacker adds service_issue() function performing the roll of Reverse Shell to the init type of Linux
shell script existing inside the system. The attacker creates a TCP socket through the function, connects to the
attacker server (158.247.221.23:80), and runs sh to provide the attacker with Linux shell.

What the Attacker Does After Penetrating into Server
After dominating a Linux system, the attacker uses RPM to install NMAP. They then perform multiple port scans on
the internal systems to identify additional attack targets.

How the Attacker Moves Inside the Internal Server
The attacker, after dominating the Windows system of the internal network, registers a service that perform Full
Memory Dumping on the memory of the Isass.exe process to obtain additional credentials. They then secure the
memory dump of the lsass.exe process.

The attacker then uses the obtained credentials to send reverse connection command to other systems. Among the
target systems that received the command, the systems connected to the Internet are connected to the C2 server. As
a result, the attacker gains direct control over the internal system from the outside.

The attacker then downloads the Gwisin MSI file from the C2 server.

How the Attacker Distributes the Ransomware
The attacker installs the IIS web service into the first dominated system and uses it to spread the ransomware to
internal systems of the target company. After installing the IIS web service, the attacker creates the ransomware files
in the web root path (C:\inetpub\wwwroot) and distributes the ransomware.
Ransomware for Windows: x64_install.msi
Ransomware for Linux: x64_nix, x86_nix

The attacker can use the IIS web service in the internal system to easily distribute the ransomware to multiples
systems connected to the domain via AD policy and WMI command. Furthermore, the attacker does not have to
directly access the server that distributes the malware on the Internet. As such, they can successfully distribute the
ransomware into the internal systems without Internet access.
The attacker uses the following command to download and run the ransomware.

When the above command is executed, “x64_install.msi,” the ransomware file in the IIS web route directory, is
downloaded and executed.
Characteristics of Gwisin
To run Gwisin, one must enter the exact arguments.

The description of each argument is as follows:
LICENSE: A key that decrypts the encoded ransomware (creates decryption key by combining with SERIAL)
SERIAL: A key that decrypts the encoded ransomware (creates decryption key by combining with LICENSE)

0: File Encryption Mode
1: Safe Mode Boot Mode
When the file is encrypted via the ransomware, an extension similar to the name of the target company is added to
the encrypted file. Additionally, a file with ‘0’ at the end of the extension is also created in the same directory. It
contains information required to restore the original file.
Upon the file encryption, a ransom note is created. The ransom note’s filename and body text contain strings that can
identify the target company. It contains the URL that connects to the attacker’s website, and account and password
that can be used to log in to the website.

Gwisin deletes event logs and ransomware files of the system after the file encryption.
