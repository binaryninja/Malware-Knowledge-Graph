Europol has announced that law enforcement in Germany and Ukraine targeted two
individuals believed to be core members of the DoppelPaymer ransomware group.
The operation consisted in raiding multiple locations in the two countries on February and
was the result of a coordinated effort that also involved Europol, the FBI and the Dutch
Police.

Two suspects detained
"German officers raided the house of a German national, who is believed to have played a
major role in the DoppelPaymer ransomware group," Europol informs in a press release
published today.

The agency notes that "despite the current extremely difficult security situation that Ukraine"
due to the Russian invasion, police officers in the country "interrogated a Ukrainian national
who is also believed to be a member of the core DoppelPaymer group."
German officers raided one location - the house of the German national believed to have had
a "major role in the DoppelPaymer ransomware group." In Ukraine, the police searched two
locations - in Kiev and Kharkiv.
Electronic equipment has been seized and investigators and IT experts are examining it for
forensic evidence.
Three experts from Europol have also been deployed to Germany to cross-check operational
information with information from Europol's databases and to help with analysis, crypto
tracing, and forensic work.
"The analysis of this data and other related cases is expected to trigger further investigative
activities," Europol says. This work may reveal other members of the ransomware group as
well as affiliates that deployed the malware and ransomed victims across the world.
Both the investigation and the legal procedures are ongoing at the moment.

Three more DoppelPaymer suspects wanted
German authorities believe that the DoppelPaymer ransomware operation involved five core
members that maintained the attack infrastructure, the data leak sites, handled negotiations,
and deployed the malware on breached networks.
Arrest warrants have been issued for another three suspects that law enforcement are
currently looking for worldwide:
Igor Garshin/Garschin - believed to be responsible for reconnaissance, breaching, and
deploying the DoppelPaymer locker on victim networks
lgor Olegovich Turashev - believed to have had a major part in attacks against German
companies, acting as the admin of the infrastructure and malware used for intrusions
Irina Zemlianikina - responsible for the initial stage of the attack, sending out malicious
emails; she was also handling the data leak sites, the chat system, and publishing the
data stolen from the victims
According to the German police, the five suspects are the "masterminds" of the
DoppelPaymer ransomware gang and are connected to Russia.

DoppelPaymer ransomware
The DoppelPaymer ransomware operation emerged in 2019 targeting critical infrastructure
organizations and large companies.

In 2020, the threat actor started to steal data from the victim networks and adopted the
double extortion method by threatening to publish the stolen files on a leak site on the Tor
network.
Europol estimates that between May 2019 and March 2021, victims based in the United
States alone paid DoppelPaymer at least $42.4 million. The German authorities have also
confirmed 37 cases where companies were targeted by the ransomware gang.
The DoppelPaymer malware is based on the BitPaymer ransomware. The file-encrypting
threat was delivered through Dridex malware, which was pushed by the infamous Emotet
botnet.
The infection vector was spear-phishing emails containing documents with malicious VBS or
JavaScript code. The threat actor also used a legitimate tool, Process Hacker, to terminate
security-related products running on the victim systems.
Although the operation rebranded as "Grief" (Pay or Grief) in July 2021 in an attempt to
escape law enforcement, attacks became more sparse.

Among DoppelPaymer's high-profile victims are Kia Motors America, the Delaware County in
Pennsylvania (paid a $500,000 ransom), laptop maker Compal, the Newcastle University
(files leaked), electronics giant Foxconn, and the Dutch Research Council (NWO).
To force victims into paying the ransom, the operators of the DoppelPaymer ransomware
threatened to wipe the decryption keys if victims contracted professional negotiators to
obtain a better price for recovering the locked data.
However, the attack frequency decreased to the point that the gang no longer maintains the
leak site.
