PLA Unit 61398 (also known as APT 1, Comment Crew, Comment Panda, GIF89a, and
Byzantine Candor) (Chinese: 61398部队, Pinyin: 61398 bùduì) is the Military Unit Cover
Designator (MUCD)[1] of a People's Liberation Army advanced persistent threat unit that has
been alleged to be a source of Chinese computer hacking attacks.[2][3] The unit is stationed
in Pudong, Shanghai.[4]

2014 indictment
On 19 May 2014, the US Department of Justice announced that a Federal grand jury had
returned an indictment of five 61398 officers on charges of theft of confidential business
information and intellectual property from U.S. commercial firms and of planting malware on
their computers.[5][6] The five are Huang Zhenyu (黄振宇), Wen Xinyu (文新宇), Sun Kailiang
(孙凯亮), Gu Chunhui (顾春晖), and Wang Dong (王东). Forensic evidence traces the base of
operations to a 12-story building off Datong Road in a public, mixed-use area of Pudong in
Shanghai.[2] The group is also known by various other names including "Advanced Persistent
Threat 1" ("APT1"), "the Comment group" and "Byzantine Candor", a codename given by US
intelligence agencies since 2002.[7][8][9][10]
A report by the computer security firm Mandiant stated that PLA Unit 61398 is believed to
operate under the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department
(GSD) Third Department (总参三部二局)[1] and that there is evidence that it contains, or is
2/11

itself, an entity Mandiant calls APT1, part of the advanced persistent threat that has attacked
a broad range of corporations and government entities around the world since at least 2006.
APT1 is described as comprising four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the
Pudong New Area. It is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China.[1][11] The Third
and Fourth Department, responsible for electronic warfare, are believed to comprise the PLA
units mainly responsible for infiltrating and manipulating computer networks.[12]
The group often compromises internal software "comment" features on legitimate web pages
to infiltrate target computers that access the sites, leading it to be known as "the Comment
Crew" or "Comment Group".[13][14] The collective has stolen trade secrets and other
confidential information from numerous foreign businesses and organizations over the
course of seven years such as Lockheed Martin, Telvent, and other companies in the
shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and
software sectors.[8]
Dell SecureWorks says it believed the group includes the same group of attackers behind
Operation Shady RAT, an extensive computer espionage campaign uncovered in 2011 in
which more than 70 organizations over a five-year period, including the United Nations,
government agencies in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, were
targeted.[2]
The attacks documented in the summer of 2011 represent a fragment of the Comment
group's attacks, which go back at least to 2002, according to incident reports and
investigators. FireEye, Inc. alone has tracked hundreds of targets in the last three years and
estimates the group has attacked more than 1,000 organizations.[9]
Most activity between malware embedded in a compromised system and the malware's
controllers takes place during business hours in Beijing's time zone, suggesting that the
group is professionally hired, rather than private hackers inspired by patriotic passions.[12]

Public position of the Chinese government
Until 2013, the Government of China has consistently denied that it is involved in hacking.[15]
In response to the Mandiant Corporation report about Unit 61398, Hong Lei, a spokesperson
for the Chinese foreign ministry, said such allegations were "unprofessional".[15][16]
In 2013, China changed its position and openly admitted to having secretive cyber warfare
units in both the military and the civilian part of the government – however, the details of their
activities were left to speculation.[17] As a show of force towards the rest of the global
community the Chinese government now openly lists their abilities when it comes to digital
spying and network attack capabilities.[18]

classic Water Margin Unit 61398 is commanded by Lin Chong. His team infiltrates
