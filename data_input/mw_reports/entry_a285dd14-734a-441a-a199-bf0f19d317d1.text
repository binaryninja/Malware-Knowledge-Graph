ANDROID BANKING MALWARE // SOPHISTICATED TROJANS VS. FAKE BANKING APPS

TLP: WHITE

INTRODUCTION
In this white paper, we will provide insight into the two most prevalent types of Android banking
malware to date – sophisticated banking Trojans and fake banking apps – and compare their different
approaches to achieving the same malicious goal.
At the same time, we will explore the impact of those approaches on potential victims.
Having identified the tactics of both categories, we will provide advice for users on how to stay safe
from Android banking malware.

THE TWO TYPES OF ANDROID BANKING MALWARE
With our lives increasingly going mobile, banking apps are rapidly becoming the go-to method of
managing finances. Malware authors motivated by financial gain have been quick to adapt their tools
and techniques to profit from this shift. As a result, mobile banking malware – and especially that
targeting the Android platform – has become a very real and potent, yet often underestimated, threat.
Figure 1 shows the rising trend in Android banking malware detections as seen in ESET telemetry data.

While the landscape of Android threats preying on sensitive financial information is undoubtedly
complex and ever-evolving, the majority of current Android banking malware falls into one of the
following, broad categories:

1. Sophisticated banking Trojans
2. Fake banking apps
Malware in both these categories is designed to achieve the same goal: steal credentials for, or money
from, their victims’ bank accounts. To achieve that, both sophisticated banking Trojans and fake banking
apps need to elicit sensitive banking information from their victims and, if direct theft is the aim,

typically also need to gain access to SMS messages received on the compromised devices1. To lure the
valuable information from potential victims, both types of malware make use of phishing and bogus
login forms.
However, despite the similarities in their objectives, sophisticated banking Trojans and fake banking
apps differ significantly in their strategy for deceiving victims. The following section will explore that
difference and offer a more detailed look into the modus operandi of each distinct malware type.

Sophisticated banking Trojans
Malware in this category is typically complex in architecture, and advanced in functionality and
detection evasion. MazarBot, BankBot, Anubis and Exobot are some of the most notorious examples of
this type of Android threat.
An important point in the evolution of sophisticated Android banking Trojans was the publication of
BankBot’s source code on an underground forum in December 2016. The released code led to the creation
of numerous new, hybrid-like, variants, and was likely one of the reasons behind the overall surge in
Android banking Trojans observed throughout 2017.

Key features and strategy
The key tactic of Android banking Trojans is the overlay attack – a technique in which the malware
overlays the targeted application with a phishing screen whenever that application is launched on the
compromised device.
On the one hand, such phishing screens are very easy to craft nowadays, can be virtually
indistinguishable from the impersonated layouts, and can be dynamically adapted to “fit” individual
victims. On the other hand, drawing over other applications without the victims’ knowledge gets more
difficult with each Android version, due to measures taken against exactly this type of threat.
If we were to describe the strategy of Android banking Trojans in one word, it would be stealth: the
presence of malware on the device and its connection to banking apps is meant to remain hidden for as
long as possible, ideally keeping the victims in the dark until it is too late.

Modus operandi
To reach their malicious goals, sophisticated Android banking Trojans typically take most or all of the
following steps:
1. Trick the victim into unknowingly installing malware using various disguises (read more in Distribution)
2. Obtain needed permissions (read more in Functionality and permissions and Stealth techniques and
detection evasion)
3. Optional: Ensure persistence on the device (read more in Special permissions and persistence and
Stealth techniques and detection evasion)
4. Wait in the background until the targeted, legitimate app is launched or trick the victim into launching
that app (read more in Targeting)
5. Overlay the legitimate app with a phishing screen requesting login credentials or credit/debit card details
(read more in Functionality and permissions)
6. Harvest entered credentials or credit/debit card details and send them to the C&C server
7. Optional: Use SMS permissions to intercept one-time password (OTP)
8. Carry out fraudulent transactions using the victim’s bank account and/or sell stolen credentials on the
black market
1 Obtaining SMS permissions for illicit purposes will likely become more complicated due to the recent change to Google Play terms
restricting the use of SMS and Call Log permission groups.

Impact on users compared to fake banking apps:
• The deciding part of this attack is getting to the point of overlaying the targeted, legitimate app
without the user noticing, while obtaining intrusive permissions, which has a lower chance of
succeeding than fake banking apps
• The malicious nature of the app is either revealed in the process of obtaining intrusive
permissions, or when it is too late; the connection to the Trojanized app is not always obvious,
so the apps may have a longer “lifespan” on Google Play than fake banking apps

Distribution
Android banking Trojans are spread through a variety of channels and under many different guises.
They can be commonly found lurking in unofficial app stores, but from time to time, some also manage
to sneak into the official Google Play store. Other common distribution methods include compromised
websites and malicious download links disseminated through social media, emails or even SMS.
As their name suggests, Trojans hide behind a seemingly legitimate mask to gain users‘ trust – be
it games, handy widgets, power boosters and battery managers, video or Flash players, or even
horoscope-themed apps (see Figure 2). The apps used as disguise sometimes provide the advertised
functionality – that is, work as expected – or provide no functionality other than the (hidden) malicious
one. The disguises are frequently changed up, complicating manual spotting and removal of Trojans on
compromised devices.
A recent example of a banking Trojan we discovered on Google Play is a Trojanized QRecorder app that
targeted German, Polish and Czech banks and was installed more than 10,000 times before being
reported by ESET and taken down from the store (see Figure 3).

Figure 2 // Recent examples of banking Trojans found on Google Play

Impact on users compared to fake banking apps:
• Malware disguised as legitimate apps have a potentially wider reach than fake banking apps

Targeting
The most usual target of Android banking Trojans are, unsurprisingly, banking apps (see Figure 4).
However, it is also common for this type of malware to customize its overlay attacks for cryptocurrency
wallets and exchanges as well as various non-banking apps like social media and messaging apps,
booking apps, app stores, etc. In case of non-banking targets, the bogus overlay screens typically
request credit/debit card details under some pretense (see Figure 5).
From the technical point of view, the scope of the overlay attacks can either depend on a hardcoded list
of targeted applications, or be dynamically adjusted to impersonate any app of the attacker’s choice.
The latter is nowadays increasingly prevalent among Android banking Trojans.

Functionality and permissions
The malicious functionality of Android banking Trojans typically includes the following capabilities:
• Remote control, using various communication methods with the C&C server
• Obtaining device information
• Downloading and executing additional apps
• Overlaying targeted, legitimate apps with phishing screens, using various techniques
• Harvesting credentials entered into the phishing forms and sending them to the C&C server
• encrypted
• unencrypted
• Intercepting, redirecting, sending and deleting SMS messages, to bypass SMS-based 2-factor
authentication
Depending on permissions gained during and after installation, sophisticated banking Trojans targeting
the Android platform are also commonly capable of:
• Displaying fake notifications to prompt victims to launch the targeted banking apps
• Obtaining the list of running applications
• Obtaining and editing the contact list
• Obtaining the phone call log, making and redirecting phone calls
• Accessing device storage
• Opening a browser and navigating to specific websites
• Accessing the camera
• Starting at device boot
• Remotely locking and unlocking the device by setting a lock screen password of the attackers’ choice
• Displaying full-screen activity to cover malicious activity running in the background
• Recording a video of the screen
• Keylogging
• Running as a proxy to route network traffic through the compromised mobile device to fool banks’
fraud detection mechanisms
Optionally, Android banking Trojans deliver the functionality advertised as part of their disguise – for
example, provide the user with a real, functioning game. Offering legitimate functionality can help keep
the malicious nature of the Trojan hidden for longer, both from affected users and Google’s security
mechanisms (read more in Stealth techniques and detection evasion).
On the other hand, the number of advanced techniques used and intrusive permissions requested by
these Trojans can also work as triggers and thwart the operation before its malicious goals are realized.

Impact on users compared to fake banking apps:
• More powerful and potentially more damaging than fake banking apps but also more prone
to detection due to advanced techniques acting as triggers for Google’s security measures,
researchers and users

Special permissions and persistence
To secure even greater control over the compromised device and ensure their malware cannot be
uninstalled in one tap, cybercriminals are also interested in gaining elevated privileges and special
permissions.
A very common way to gain a foothold in the system is obtaining device administrator rights for the
malware – as long as an app is an active device administrator, it cannot be uninstalled. At the same
time, device administrator rights come with some particularly intrusive permissions, such as changing
the lock-screen password, locking the device, or wiping all its contents.
When requesting the activation of device administrator rights, Android banking Trojans either continue
posing as whatever legitimate app they have been impersonating from the beginning, or employ the
ruse of claiming to be a seemingly unrelated process (see Figure 6). Very often, we’ve seen malware
impersonate Google or Adobe apps, or even the Android operating system itself.
Some Trojans take this persistence method a step further and employ measures to force the activation
or prevent the deactivation of the device administrator, e.g. by having the request pop up in a loop until
the user clicks „activate“.

Figure 6 // A variant of BankBot posing as a “System update” with the Google Play icon
to obtain device administrator rights

Another way to take over a device is through the misuse of the Android Accessibility service.
Accessibility service functionality was created to assist users with disabilities in using Android devices by
giving applications access to actions that would otherwise require physical interaction with the device.
In practice, this means that an active Accessibility service with enabled accessibility permissions can, for
example, mimic users‘ taps and swipes and thus navigate through screens on their behalf.
In the wrong hands, such capabilities can be incredibly dangerous, and enabling an Accessibility
service belonging to a banking Trojan (or any other malware, for that matter) can have some nasty
consequences.

ANDROID BANKING MALWARE // SOPHISTICATED TROJANS VS. FAKE BANKING APPS

TLP: WHITE

As with device administrators, accessibility permissions are also often requested seemingly on behalf of
a well-known, legitimate service rather than the actual banking Trojan app (see Figure 7).

Figure 7 // A variant of BankBot requesting the activation of its malicious Accessibility service disguised
as “Google service”, and using a description taken from Google’s original Terms of Service

In the past few years, we have observed malware abuse Accessibility services mainly to secure further
intrusive permissions without having to rely on victims’ consent.
In November 2018, we discovered a novel Accessibility-abusing technique in which the permission to
perform clicks on behalf of the user is misused for direct theft with the malware navigating through
targeted financial apps and transferring funds to its operators. For the technique to work, malware
authors first need to reverse engineer the targeted, legitimate apps and identify relevant areas of
activity, such as buttons and text boxes.
Besides legitimate permissions and rights that end up being misused by criminals, there are also special
permissions that have been introduced to the Android platform specifically to counter malware attacks.
From Android 6.0, apps that want to overlay the screen while another app is running need to obtain the
permission to Display over other apps. As overlaying other apps with screen activity of their choosing is
precisely what Android banking Trojans do, they need to either trick users into granting the permission,
or circumvent it. That could mean using a different technique to display screens on top of others, or
trying their luck with a malicious Accessibility service, which, when active, can carry out almost any
action on the device.

Impact on users compared to fake banking apps:
• Potentially more damaging and more difficult to remove than fake banking apps but also
more prone to detection due to advanced techniques acting as triggers for Google’s security
measures, security researchers and users
• Failure to gain intrusive permissions may disrupt their whole operation

Stealth techniques and detection evasion
As previously mentioned, banking Trojans are all about stealth – be it to remain unnoticed by defenders,
or to keep their intentions hidden from potential victims.
Over the years, malware authors have been using increasingly advanced techniques to prevent their
code from being detected and analyzed. Among the most commonly used detection evasion and antianalysis measures are code obfuscation, packing, encryption and multi-stage malware architecture, as
well as emulator and sandbox checks. More recently, timers scheduling the onset of malicious activity
have been adopted by some sophisticated banking Trojans, with the aim of confusing both detection
engines and affected users.
Using actual, complex apps built from open source code with added malicious functionality can have a
similar effect in fooling both security measures and unsuspecting users – something that many Android
banking Trojans take advantage of.
Deceiving users is of particular importance for criminals in the Android malware business – even the
most sophisticated detection evasion measures are no use if a potential victim is alarmed by suspicious
app behavior before the attack takes place. After installation, for example, Trojans often present users
with fake error messages claiming the app has been uninstalled (see Figure 8), which is followed by the
app’s icon being hidden. To obtain intrusive permissions, banking Trojans commonly impersonate wellknown, legitimate services. To cover malicious activity running in the background, sophisticated banking
Trojans sometimes display full-screen activity that users cannot remove (see Figure 9).

displayed by a variant of BankBot and Android/Charger.B

Impact on users compared to fake banking apps:
• Sophisticated banking Trojans employing advanced detection evasion techniques might be
more successful at bypassing Google’s and AV security measures and thus potentially reach and
affect more users
• Large, legitimate code base may help conceal malicious capabilities, or otherwise be less
suspicious to heuristic detection methods

Fake banking apps
Contrary to the complex workings of sophisticated banking Trojans, fake banking apps operate in a
more straightforward way, with functionality usually limited to displaying bogus login screens and
harvesting entered data. This type of malware continued to increase in prevalence throughout 2018.
Note: We refer to this category of malware as fake banking apps because legitimate banking apps are its most
usual target. However, cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, as well as other finance-oriented and payment
services and/or apps, are also sometimes impersonated by malicious fakes operating similarly to the malware
described below.

Key features and strategy
Fake banking apps bet everything on the success of impersonation – their whole operation stands or falls
on how believably they can imitate a legitimate banking application, or stand in for a non-existent one, from
the very first moment a potential victim comes across them, up to the point when the victim enters sensitive
information.
Their weapon of choice is therefore their presentation – from app name, through app description, to icon
and preview images, the apps need to appear trustworthy to attract unsuspecting users.

Modus operandi
To reach their malicious goals, fake banking apps typically take the following steps:
1. Trick victims into installing malware by posing as a legitimate banking app (read more in Distribution)
2. Obtain needed permissions
3. Upon launch, display a phishing screen mimicking a legitimate banking app and requesting login
credentials or credit/debit card details (read more in Targeting)
4. Harvest credentials or credit/debit card details entered into the bogus form
5. Display an error/thank-you message; offer no further functionality
6. Optional: Use SMS permissions to intercept one-time password (OTP)
7. Carry out fraudulent transactions using the victim’s account or sell credentials on the black market

Impact on users compared to sophisticated banking Trojans:
• The deciding part of the operation is its beginning – successful impersonation leading to a
potential victim’s decision to install the fake banking app
• People who fall for the impersonation and install the app are likely to become victims as they
install these apps believing they are installing legitimate banking apps, and thus expect to see a
login screen after launching the app and are willing to enter their credentials
• The malicious nature of the app is revealed when it is too late, but in an obvious manner,
which often motivates victims to take action against the app – as a result, the apps may have a
shorter “lifespan” on Google Play than sophisticated banking Trojans

12

ANDROID BANKING MALWARE // SOPHISTICATED TROJANS VS. FAKE BANKING APPS

Distribution
Fake banking apps are usually spread through Google Play or unofficial app stores, where they pose as
legitimate banking, or other finance, applications.
Attackers spreading these malicious fakes try to entice their victims by using legitimate-looking app names
and icons, accompanied by sleek preview images and trustworthy descriptions. What can sometimes serve
as an indicator of something fishy is a mismatched app category (e.g. an apparent banking app placed in the
‘Books & Reference’ category, as seen in Figure 10), or an unfamiliar developer name with no connection to
the financial institution supposedly issuing the app.

Figure 10 // Malicious app impersonating PostFinance, a Swiss financial institution, on Google Play

Impact on users compared to sophisticated banking Trojans:
• A more limited reach than banking Trojans disguised as various non-banking apps

13

ANDROID BANKING MALWARE // SOPHISTICATED TROJANS VS. FAKE BANKING APPS

TLP: WHITE

Targeting
In contrast to banking Trojans, fake banking apps typically focus on targeting customers of just one financial
institution or service – the one that they impersonate. An exception to this was a fake app claiming to be a
universal banking tool for Polish users that targeted customers of 19 Polish banks with bogus login screens.
When choosing their target, some malware authors take advantage of the absence of an official mobile app
for the targeted bank or service, while others attempt to fool users by impersonating existing official apps.
Occasionally, the fakes pretend to offer additional, attractive functionality to existing legitimate apps, such
as offering bank rewards, gifts or offering to increase credit card limits (see Figure 11).

Figure 11 // Malicious app impersonating Indian Icici bank and claiming to increase credit card limit for its customers

Impact on users compared to sophisticated banking Trojans:
• A more limited target group than sophisticated banking Trojans (depending on the customer
base of the targeted institution or service)

14

ANDROID BANKING MALWARE // SOPHISTICATED TROJANS VS. FAKE BANKING APPS

TLP: WHITE

Functionality and permissions
As previously mentioned, these fake apps rely on deception through impersonation, thus their functionality
comes down to displaying bogus login screens and harvesting credentials entered into the fake forms (see
Figure 12).
After the credentials are stolen, some apps display generic messages with a promise to get back to the
victim, as a cover for not offering any real functionality (see Figure 13). Optionally, depending on permissions
gained during and after installation, fake banking apps can also intercept and redirect SMS messages to
bypass SMS-based 2-factor authentication. As users install these apps believing they are installing real
banking applications, they are likely to grant the apps SMS permissions without thinking twice about it.

ANDROID BANKING MALWARE // SOPHISTICATED TROJANS VS. FAKE BANKING APPS

TLP: WHITE

Impact on users compared to sophisticated banking Trojans:
• Less powerful than sophisticated banking Trojans but also less prone to early detection due to a
lack of advanced techniques acting as triggers for Google’s security measures, researchers and
users

Special permissions and persistence
If the operation of fake banking apps goes according to plan, they reach their goal almost immediately
after being installed and launched by a victim. For this reason, the fraudulent apps typically do not attempt
to obtain extensive permissions on the affected device and can thus be considered less invasive than
sophisticated banking Trojans. Then again, the absence of intrusive techniques may help them fly under the
radar for longer periods of time.

Impact on users compared to sophisticated banking Trojans:
• Less powerful and easier to remove than sophisticated banking Trojans but also less prone
to detection due to a lack of advanced techniques acting as triggers for Google’s security
measures, researchers and users

Stealth techniques and detection evasion
The stealth techniques used by fake banking apps typically do not go beyond code obfuscation.

Impact on users compared to sophisticated banking Trojans:
• Less advanced detection evasion techniques than sophisticated banking Trojans, however, the
lack of advanced techniques acting as triggers might balance out the overall effect

COMPARISON OF THE THREATS
To sum up, sophisticated banking Trojans have a potentially wider target group and reach than fake
banking apps. They are characterized by extensive capabilities and stealthy operation. However, the
same attributes that make them powerful also make them prone to being detected – and not just by
security measures and researchers, but also noticed by users before they have fallen victim.
Fake banking apps, on the other hand, have a more limited target group and reach and are simpler and
less invasive than sophisticated banking Trojans. However, their strategy ensures that those who fall for
the initial impersonation and install them are very likely to become victims.

HOW TO STAY SAFE FROM ANDROID BANKING MALWARE
This section provides advice addressing the most common Android banking malware attack scenarios,
including the more advanced persistence techniques used by some sophisticated banking Trojans.

How to prevent, spot and remove sophisticated banking Trojans
Prevention
• Only install apps from Google Play; this does not ensure the app is not malicious, but apps like these
are much more common in third-party app stores where they are rarely removed once uncovered,
unlike on Google Play
• Before installing an app from Google Play, always check its ratings, content of reviews, number of
installs, and permissions requested by the app, specifically paying attention to SMS permissions
in apps that have no reason to require them
• After installing, keep paying attention to further permission requests and be extra cautious
before activating any intrusive permissions, specifically paying attention to requests to draw
over other apps, and requests for device administrator rights or accessibility permissions
• Keep your device and applications updated
• Use a reputable mobile security solution

Spotting
The most reliable way to detect banking Trojans on your device is to run a scan using a reputable mobile
security solution.

Removing
If malware is detected on your Android device, you can use a reputable mobile security solution to clean
it.
In case you wish to remove a banking Trojan from your Android device manually, you need to know the
names the malware and its further potential payloads use for their various forms and disguises, and
locate and remove each of them. This may include:
• Malware as a Trojanized app in Apps/Application manager
• Malware as an active device administrator
• An active malicious Accessibility service
If advanced persistence techniques are used, booting the device in Safe mode and then locating and
removing the malware might be necessary.

Mitigating damage
Apart from cleaning your device, it is advisable to take the following measures:
• Change your credit/debit card PIN codes as well as internet banking passwords
• Check your bank account for suspicious transactions
• If there are suspicious transactions, contact your bank
• Consider replacing your credit/debit card

How to prevent, spot and remove fake banking apps
Prevention
• Only trust mobile banking and other finance apps if they are linked from the official website of
your bank or the financial service
• If you are inclined to download a banking app because it offers some attractive extra features, or
the bank previously hasn’t offered a mobile app, always check the official website of the bank for
a link to the app
• Only enter your sensitive information into online forms if you are sure of their security and legitimacy
• Keep your device updated
• Use a reputable mobile security solution

Spotting
The lack of fuctionality usually makes victims realize they have installed a fraudulent app, so spotting
such apps should not be a problem. If you are not sure, we recommend scanning your device using a
reputable mobile security solution.

Removing
The apps usually do not take extra measures to secure persistence on affected devices. In most cases,
they can be simply uninstalled in Apps/Application manager.

Mitigating damage
As well as cleaning your device, it is advisable to take the following measures:
• Change your credit/debit card PIN codes as well as internet banking passwords
• Check your bank account for suspicious transactions
• If there are suspicious transactions, contact your bank
• Consider replacing your credit/debit card

CONCLUSION
In this white paper, we have identified the two main categories of banking malware currently preying
on Android users.
While sophisticated banking Trojans have long been regarded as a serious threat to Android users, fake
banking apps have sometimes been viewed as “just scams” due to their limited capabilities. Despite not
being technically advanced, we believe fake banking apps are a serious threat to Android users.
Sure – the damage done by sophisticated banking Trojans can go beyond phished banking credentials,
and they are overall a more worrying threat to cross paths with. But as far as credential and money
theft are concerned, fake banking apps might be just as effective – and thus dangerous for users – as
sophisticated banking Trojans.
Besides this, fake banking apps are an increasingly prevalent threat, which is not all that surprising as
the apps are easier to create and confronted with fewer obstacles in their operation – and criminals
motivated by money tend to favor the easiest path to financial gain.
We can only speculate what type of malware will dominate the Android threat landscape in the
coming years. However, it is beyond doubt that mobile devices will continue to be an attractive target
for cybercriminals – which makes taking extra measures for keeping them safe worthwhile, if not
necessary.
It is important to note that all the apps discussed within these categories are detected and blocked by
ESET systems.
