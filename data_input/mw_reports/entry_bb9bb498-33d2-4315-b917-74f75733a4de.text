APT & Targeted Attacks
This blog details how Iron Tiger threat actors have updated their toolkit with an updated SysUpdate malware
variant that now uses five files in its infection routine instead of the usual three.

More than a year after Operation DRBControl, a campaign by a cyberespionage group that targets gambling
and betting companies in Southeast Asia, we found evidence that the Iron Tiger threat actor is still interested
in the gambling industry.
This blog details how Iron Tiger threat actors have updated their toolkit with an updated SysUpdate malware
variant that now uses five files in its infection routine instead of the usual three. We also provide details on
Iron Tiger’s possible connections to other threat actors based on similar tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) we’ve observed. Finally, we describe some of the rootkits that Iron Tiger is using, one of which is used
to hide files at the kernel level, and has not been previously reported as being used by this threat actor.

A Look at the Iron Tiger Threat Group
In 2019, Talent-Jump, Inc., a security service and system integration company, discovered several malware
variants in a gambling company during an incident response operation and sought our help for further
investigation and analysis.
In 2020 and 2021, Talent-Jump found new samples for malware families that are attributed to the Iron Tiger
threat actor, which is also referred to as LuckyMouse, EmissaryPanda, and APT27.
While investigating Operation DRBControl in 2019, we found several connections to multiple threat actors:
Iron Tiger, which uses the HyperBro trojan and some infrastructure links
Winnti, which uses the same infrastructure and code-sharing links detailed in our paper
Bronze President, a threat actor that targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Back in 2019, we
named a malware family, which we believed was new, as “Type 2.”
However, after the publication of our report, we learned that the Type 2 malware family described in our
report was the same as the “RCSession” malware family that Dell Secureworks described in a blog that they
published in December 2019.
After finding multiple tools belonging to the Iron Tiger threat actor (which we now track as Earth Smilodon),
it is likely that the new malware families that we found during the Operation DRBControl investigation came
from the same threat actor.

Figure 1. The old and new SysUpdate infection chains

In December 2020, we found a sample that we identified as one belonging to the SysUpdate malware family,
also named Soldier, FOCUSFJORD, and HyperSSL. SysUpdate was first described by the NCC Group in 2018.
In the past, SysUpdate was loaded in memory by a known method involving three files:
One legitimate executable, sometimes signed, and vulnerable to dynamic-link library (DLL) sideloading
One malicious DLL loaded by the legitimate file
One binary file usually containing obfuscated code, unpacked in memory by the malicious DLL
An additional executable that serves as a launcher is loaded in memory, which then loads the final SysUpdate
payload. Based on our investigation, instead of the usual three files, the threat actor used five:
dlpumgr32.exe, a legitimate signed file that belongs to the DESlock+ product
DLPPREM32.DLL, a malicious DLL sideloaded by dlpumgr32.exe that loads and decodes
DLPPREM32.bin
DLPPREM32.bin, a shellcode that decompresses and loads a launcher in memory
data.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher and contains two SysUpdate versions: one for a 32bit architecture and another for a 64-bit architecture
config.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher and contains the SysUpdate configuration, such as
the command-and-control (C&C) address

In summary, the launcher acts as an installer — it will copy the malware to a fixed place and ensure that it runs
during the next boot of the infected host. In detail, this process involves multiple steps.
The launcher starts by instantiating the CLoadInfo object, which has the following structure:
Offset

VTable of CLoadInfo class

4

Directory to copy all files

%PROGRAMDATA%\Test\

36

Name of the service DisplayName

Table 1. CLoadInfo object structure
The launcher’s behavior changes depending on the number of arguments passed to the executable. It’s
important to highlight that the change of behavior only depends on the number of arguments, and not the
content:
No argument. If there is no argument, a hardcoded directory will be created wherein all the files will be
copied. The CreationTime, LastWriteTime, and LastAccessTime will be updated according to the
C:\Windows\system32\kernel32.dll file and their file attributes will be set to “hidden” and “system”.
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) will be used to run dlpumgr32.exe with arguments “-up
-run -x” and it will exit the current process.
One argument. It will skip the decoding of the configuration and persistence setup, and will perform
the same behavior as one with three arguments.

Three arguments.
The launcher first decrypts the config.res file with a hardcoded Data Encryption Standard (DES)
key. It encodes it using another key and writes it to the registry key
“Software\Classes\scConfig” (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER
hive, depending on the privileges of the process).
After decrypting the configuration, the config.res file is deleted.
Depending on the privileges of the process, the malware will add a value to the
“Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” key, or it will create a service that
runs the malware at boot time
The launcher decrypts the data.res file with a different hardcoded DES key. The result is a file with
the following structure:
Size of the 32-bit shellcode
32-bit shellcode
Size of the 64-bit shellcode
64-bit shellcode

Table 2. Structure of decrypted data.res file
Lastly, the launcher starts a suspended process with the command line
“C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k LocalServices,”and injects the appropriate shellcode into
it (either 32- or 64-bit). It will then resume the newly created process and exit the current process.
The following diagram summarizes the launch procedure:

The payload itself is a new version of SysUpdate.

Analysis of the Payload
The features of the updated SysUpdate payload look similar to its previous versions. We observed that the C++
code is structured around classes, many of which have self-explanatory names. Some of these classes, such as
CCompress, CIOStreamIF, or CTcpSocket,have been present in the older versions of SysUpdate and compiled
near the end of 2015.
Others have been in existence for many years, such as TPacket, SCM Client, SystemInfo, CMD5, CIOStream,
and CInfo. Some of them are newer and have been developed in 2020, such as ConfigReg, CWorkQueue,
WindowsEvent, and CEncoder or cudp.
The sample we’ve analyzed contained many new and unique classes that featured a particular naming
convention. The names of classes are mostly self-explanatory, and the manner in which the classes have been
organized is probably the result of a framework developed by our threat actor.
Some of the classes’ names start with “H” (HControl, HSleep, and HTrans), “I” (IAgent, ITcpAgent, and
IAgentListener), “T” (TCommon, TFileInfo, TFileRename, TFileUpload, TServicesInfo, TListUser, and
TTransmit), “C” (CSSLAgent, CSocks5, and CTcpAgent) or “CM” (CMCapture, CMFile, CMPipeClient,
CMPipeServer, CMProcess, CMServices, and CMShell).
The communication is made via a named pipe (in our case, it’s “\\.\pipe\testPipe”). Multiple features that
are expected of an espionage backdoor are present in the sample. These include a screenshot feature, file
management functions (such as search, delete, move, upload, and download), process and services

management, and command execution.
It should be noted that we also found recent samples of the SysUpdate backdoor that do not implement these
“new” classes. This suggests that different groups (or subgroups of Iron Tiger) are also using this malware
family in their attacks.

Pandora Backdoor
On two occasions (in March and October 2020), we found a kernel rootkit that had been deployed. After
analysis, it appears that this rootkit’s behavior is very similar to that of the NDISProxy driver and remote
access trojan (RAT). The version we found is slightly different — the driver isn’t digitally signed but instead
utilizes a known exploit to bypass Windows Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) protection and load the
driver directly into the system.
We chose to call it “Pandora” based on the program database (PDB) path of the unpacked stage 2, which is
“F:\Pandora\x\drv(32-64)\bin\src\drvx64.pdb.”
The rootkit has multiple stages before getting to the actual payload:
Stage 1
Grants system privileges via Windows services
Uses DLL sideloading technique to evade security solutions
Starts and injects code to a new svchost process to prevent tracking
Stage 2
Utilizes a known vulnerability (CPU-Z CVE-2017-15303) that allows it to read and write into physical
memory and read CPU control registers to turn the DSE off. This is done in conjunction with the Process
Monitor driver (procxp152.sys), both of which are dropped upon loading the rootkit, even if they are
not originally installed in the machine.
Loads "drvx64.sys," a crafted Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) driver
Stage 2 - Driver
Registers WPF callback and filters incoming traffic with a predefined token
Injects final payload into "lsass.exe"
Stage 3 - Final Payload
Installs itself as a Windows service
Sets a specific keyword for communication
Exchanges messages and commands with the kernel driver
Performs backdoor functions
Each backdoor has a different token that is encrypted in the registry. If the incoming traffic contains a token
and is in the HTTP format, the backdoor will intercept the traffic and process the command. In the version
that we’ve analyzed, the installer writes the token in the registry key. We can’t trigger the backdoor without a
current token, which makes the backdoor more difficult to find and analyze.

Table 4. Pandora’s public code repositories
Rootkit From a Public Repository
We found a rootkit that is being used for hiding processes, files, and services. It was taken from a public
GitHub repository whose author is not associated with the threat actor.
Hidden.sys - https://github.com/JKornev/hidden/tree/master/
The sample was found in April 2020. The driver was not signed and used the same DSE exploit that the
Pandora backdoor uses for it to load.
The tool is used to hide the threat actors’ tools and services. The tool’s configuration was added to registry run
keys on a victim’s computer.

Table 5. The tool’s configuration
The references to “Hidden” are related to the rootkit itself. The “dlpumgr32.exe” and “servTest” lines are
related to the new version of SysUpdate which we described earlier.
We do not know which malware variant is being sideloaded by vlc.exe. It is probably installed as a service
named “TrkWkss.” We found a SysUpdate sample compiled in November 2020 that abuses a DLL
sideloading vulnerability in VLC (see IOC list). This confirms that this threat actor is abusing this legitimate
program to sideload its backdoors.
HyperBro Malware Family
The Iron Tiger APT group has used the HyperBro malware family since at least 2017. It is the evolved version
of HttpBrowser, which the group has been using since at least 2015.
We found earlier versions of this malware that were sideloaded by malicious DLL files that unpacked and
loaded a binary file named “thumb.db” in memory. All the requests were sent to the C&C server on port 443,
with “/ajax” as the uniform resource identifier (URI).
While investigating Operation DRBControl, we found an updated version of this malware family that
implements some new classes. We provided a detailed analysis of this new HyperBro version in our research.
We also discovered that the binary file that’s being unpacked and loaded in memory by malicious DLL files is
named “thumb.dat.” We also saw that all requests sent to the C&C server were sent to the URI
“/api/v2/ajax” on port 443.
Since we analyzed that single sample, we found several new samples that matched the newer behavior, some of
which have been deployed in our gambling target.
However, we continue seeing samples that feature the “older” behaviors, which suggests that different groups
— or possibly subgroups of Iron Tiger — are using this malware family. Some of these samples match the
target and behavior listed by ESET in their blog.

FRP Tool
We found the FRP tool being used on a Linux host, which is similar to Avast’s findings in a report that they
published on the Iron Tiger threat actor.
The FRP tool that we analyzed was a modified version, which was possibly copied off of Github.

Type 1 Malware Family
We found three new samples of the Type 1 malware family that abuses Dropbox as a secondary C&C channel,
which we described in our Operation DRBControl whitepaper.

Iron Tiger APT Updates Toolkit With Evolved SysUpdate Malware

Apart from a modification in the malware sample’s configuration (which happened after we published our
paper), the differences with the versions that we analyzed in 2019 are minor. The version numbering was at
11.0, while the last sample we analyzed in August 2019 was at version number 9.0. This shows that the
development is still active.
On the infrastructure side, we observed that the threat actor switched from using IP addresses hosted on the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to IP addresses hosted on Microsoft Azure.
It should be noted that after our blog publication in February 2020, the threat actor compiled new Type 1
malware samples using a new configuration, which prevented us from closely monitoring their operations. We
believe that this was a direct reaction to our research, suggesting that the threat actor read our investigation.
It’s also important to note that the compilation timestamp of the sideloaded DLLs were set a few months in
advance. For example, the binaries that we found in March and April 2020 had an August 26, 2020
compilation date. This is consistent with the behavior that we noticed during Operation DRBControl, wherein
some binaries that have been found in mid-2019 had a compilation date of March 4, 2020. This shows that the
threat actors intended to confuse forensics investigators with incorrect timestamps, which is why it’s critical to
analyze timestamps with caution during investigations.

Infection Vector
We could not confirm the primary infection vector. However, traces of the exploitation of the Microsoft
Exchange vulnerability CVE-2020-0688 were found.
Multiple infection vectors have been attributed to this threat actor in the past:
Watering holes
Weaponized documents exploiting the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) method
Weaponized documents exploiting the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Equation Editor
Exploitation of the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability in Sharepoint
Supply chain attack that compromises a chat software installer, Able Desktop
Exploitation of recent vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE2021-27065) in Microsoft Exchange Server
During our investigation, we found some old samples that fit in these categories but have not been reported.
They are unrelated to this campaign and can be found in our IOC list.

Targets
The closer look into Iron Tiger was prompted because of an incident response investigation involving a
Philippine-based gambling company that the group targeted. True to form, the Iron Tiger threat actor has
targeted the same company for 18 months.
Aside from targeting the same company, Iron Tiger also targeted other countries and industries. Over the past
18 months, we observed how the group targeted governments, banks, telecommunication providers, and even
the energy sector in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

Figure 3. The countries that Iron Tiger has targeted in the past 18 months

Timeline
The following timeline shows different samples found in the same gambling company that Talent-Jump and
Trend Micro investigated:
July 2019: Operation DRBControl starts
October 2019: One HyperBro malware sample found
March 2020: New sample of Type 1 malware variant and a rootkit called Pandora found
April 2020: One rootkit sample for hiding files processes, files, and services found
October 2020: New HyperBro and Pandora samples found
December 2020: One sample of the SysUpdate malware variant found
January 2021: Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) Linux tool found

Conclusion
This investigation provides more insight into the evolution of Iron Tiger’s toolkit and shows the threat actor’s
persistence after targeting the same company for 18 months, as well as expanding its target base to include
other companies and sectors in different countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
We detailed how Iron Tiger threat actors have updated their tools, adding new features, and slightly changing
their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), notably by using a rootkit to hide its backdoors. The different
campaigns with different versions of the same tools concurrently being used suggest that there might be
subgroups for this threat actor, or multiple groups with access to the builders of these tools.
We expect to see more cases involving four or five files instead of the usual “trident” in the future.
