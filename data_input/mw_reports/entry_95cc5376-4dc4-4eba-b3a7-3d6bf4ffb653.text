What’s new ?
The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence (PTI) Team has published this report to provide
in-depth knowledge about the threat actors who operate LockBit ransomware. The
PTI Team has managed to extract decryption tools for most of the victims who were
affected by LockBit. All affiliates of the ransomware group, including the developer,
were also identified during the PTI team’s investigation. This report answers questions
such as : How do they select their targets ? How many targets did they breach ? How
does the network operate ? Who are the affiliates ?
Why does it matter ?
Ransomware is a growing problem and most of the research in this area is
focused on analyzing malware samples and their encryption techniques. There are
a limited number of sources that cover the working dynamics of the threat actors.
Statistics related to the ransomware groups are formed by reported cases and
approximations. This report contains the most accurate metrics and provides full
visibility of a well-known ransomware group structure.
What should be done ?
If no one pays any ransom, then the ransomware business will surely end. However,
this is not an easy decision when C-levels are under constant pressure of losing
reputation and money. The report will help the reader understand more about the
threat actors and their operations. Several countermeasures will be provided along
with the vulnerabilities used in ransomware cases. #DontPanicDontPay

LockBit RaaS Case Report

Introduction

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts the victim’s data and demands
a ransom payment. In addition to making the data inaccessible, most of the attackers
threaten to publish the victim’s data unless the ransom is paid by a certain time (”Double
Extortion”). Ransomware is mostly used as a money-making scheme by cyber criminals but it
may also be used in different scenarios to coerce the user into any action by using leverage.
While ransomware has been in use for decades, it has gained much popularity among
cyber criminals in recent years due to the low level of experience it requires to conduct such
attacks and the ease of using anonymous payment methods. It is expected that losses from
ransomware attacks are likely to exceed $20 billion by 2021 [2].
Ransomware can be separated into two groups based on their modus operandi, namely
FAR (Fully Automated Ransomware) and SAR (Semi-Automated Ransomware). In FAR cases,
ransomware generally infects the system via phishing emails or malicious web pages
containing the malicious payload. The malware contains the code to spread deeper
into the network, identify files, carry out the encryption, and leave a note to the victim,
explaining how to make the payment for the recovery. Threat actors using FAR mostly focus
on distribution channels and spreading methods of the malware and tend to stay away
from making direct contact with the victim. Although the execution of FAR attacks is more
straightforward, the success rate is much lower for high-value organizations as they have
different protection tools such as AVs, access controls, and EDRs in place. Victims of FAR
attacks are also more cautious about paying the ransom as there is a tendency among
people to distrust automated systems. The behavior model is similar to a customer asking for
a representative before purchasing to clarify doubts. It is troubling to see people still want to
negotiate and discuss the payment with a human being, knowing that they are criminals.
On the other hand, SAR attacks involve manual interaction of cyber criminals with the
victims’ servers. To access the network of the target organization, attackers often use 0-day
or N-day exploits. We also observe that some of the attackers buy RDP or VPN credentials
directly from other hackers and underground markets. Upon successful entry, attackers
use common pentest tools for lateral movement in the network, escalate their privileges,
and carry out the encryption step via set of encryption tools and/or ransomware. On
rare occasions, some of the encrypted data can be recovered due to operational mistakes [5].
Modern cyber crime businesses use hierarchical work flows to monetize their operations. X
(Ransomware, Malware, Dropper, etc.) as a Service models became popular among criminals
as a different skill set is required to conduct such advanced attacks. In this report, we will
explain how RaaS models work in general and also present in-depth knowledge from the
attackers’ side. We believe that our findings will help other researchers understand the
working dynamics of similar ransomware groups.
In this report, we will analyze a widely known ransomware called ”LockBit” and provide a deep
understanding of how criminals breach and monetize their operations. We will not focus on
sample analysis as there are many resources covering the technical analysis of the malware
execution. Instead, this will be the first report to presents all possible behind-the-scenes

Executive Summary

2.1

Overview

LockBit is a relatively new ransomware which has became quite popular in the past few
months. Formerly known as “ABCD” ransomware, it has since grown into a unique threat within
the scope of these extortion tools [4]. Our PTI Team started analyzing the LockBit group
around 20.03.2021 based on an emergency request from one of our clients. The investigation
was completed by successfully retrieving the decryption keys and restoring the files of our
client. Moreover, we helped dozens of other victims to retrieve their decryption keys, thus
preventing an estimated 8 million dollars of loss. This report presents interesting facts about
the ransomware business by accurately showcasing rates, commissions, infection techniques,
and the criminal organization’s structure.

2.2

LockBit Ransomware

LockBit ransomware is a malicious program that prevents users from accessing their
computers unless the requested ransom payment is given to the attackers. LockBit can
automatically scan a network for useful targets, spread the infection, and encrypt all
computers that are available. This ransomware is used in unique attacks against companies
and other organizations.
According to the statistics shared by Coveware [3], The LockBit ransomware attacks has
increased drastically in the Q4 of 2020. The following table shows that LockBit ransomware
is in the third place among other ransomware families, with 7.5% of the market share.

LockBit RaaS Case Report

Figure 1. Coveware’s Most Common Ransomware Variants in Q1 2020

For ransomware creators, RaaS is a new business model. Said creators, similar to software
as a service (SaaS) providers, sell or lease their ransomware variants to affiliates, who
then use them to carry out attacks. This business model often includes a platform in the
form of a management panel. Customers of LockBit service(affiliate threat actors) use this
management panel to create new ransomware samples, manage victims, and get statistics
about their attacks. According to the PTI Team’s investigation, LockBit threat actors are also
using methods such as extortion and victim shaming to force victims to pay the ransom
money.
Analyst Note : The concept of ”victim shaming” can be explained as a pressure tactic
often used by ransomware groups to push victim organizations into fulfilling the ransom
demand. These tactics may include threatening to release stolen confidential data of the
victims or e-mailing the business partners of the victims about the ransomware attack.

2.3

RaaS Business Structure

RaaS owners employ multiple affiliates who are responsible for breaching into victims’
systems and encrypt their files. These affiliates are selected mostly from forums among highly
skilled hackers with penetration testing backgrounds. Another way of becoming an affiliate

is to have an established trade network to obtain access to information from other criminals.
In both cases, RaaS owners require references from other criminals before hiring any affiliate.
Reputations of the criminals become essential in such cases. Most of the affiliates earn
between 10%-30% commission from each ransom payment. RaaS owners also often provide
virtual machines, exploits, and tools for their affiliates to support their attacks. Each affiliate
has access to a panel where they can monitor their victims and communicate with them. An
affiliate panel usually has the following capabilities :
a ransomware executable
• Creating/Building
Providing
a
decryptor
program upon payment
• Providing a payment gateway
(cryptocoins) for the victims
• Calculating the commission rates
• Monitoring victims and statistics of the affiliates
• Providing a chat functionality to talk with the victims

breach new targets. Whenever an affiliate becomes inactive for a long period of time, RaaS
owners remove the account of that affiliate, which also effects their reputation.

Technical Analysis

This section contains technical analysis of the LockBit ransomware as a service (RaaS)
platform including the management panel, ransomware sample, decryptor software, and
the step-by-step analysis of a LockBit attack kill chain. This section also contains intelligence
about the threat actors (developers and affiliates) using LockBit service and their TTP analysis.

3.1

The LockBit Attack Kill Chain

The following steps will briefly explain the overall LockBit attack kill chain. Every technique,
tactic, and procedure is based on the LockBit service affiliates at the time of the PTI Team
investigation. The attack vectors and every kind of actor-specific behaviour can be different
in every LockBit attack, given that LockBit is a RaaS platform.
3.1.1

Target Selection

Ransomware operators use multiple methods for selecting their next potential target. LockBit
affiliates use mass vulnerability scanning, phishing, and credential stuffing[9] as main sources
for finding new victims. According to our investigation, the most frequent method used by
the LockBit group is to buy already-compromised servers & RDP accesses from underground
shops. Such credentials can be purchased for as low as $5, thus making it very lucrative for
affiliates considering the demanded ransom amount. During the LockBit investigation, the
PTI Team was also able to identify a couple of the attack vectors used for mass vulnerability
scanning by the LockBit affiliates. According to the chat logs between the LockBit affiliates
and multiple victims, the Fortinet VPN exploit [7] was one of the most used methods to gain
access to the target company networks.

The PTI Team was also able to contact multiple LockBit victim companies. Based on the
forensic analysis of the victim companies, the PTI Team came to the conclusion that LockBit
affiliates also use generic phishing campaigns and credential stuffing attacks for gaining
access to the target company servers.
3.1.2

Preparation

After gaining access to the target company servers, LockBit affiliates usually starts the
enumeration process. According to our forensic investigations on multiple LockBit victims, the
PTI Team observed that before launching the LockBit ransomware, attackers tries to identify
mission critical systems such as domain controllers, backup servers or NAS devices. Once
the necessary enumeration is done by the attackers, the data exfiltration phase begins. The
LockBit attackers evaluate the data inside the breached system and decide whether it is
important for the target company. The critical data gets exfiltrated by the attackers and
uploaded to free file upload services such as MEGA. Uploaded data are used for extortion
while negotiating with the victims.

affiliates enter the target company name as a comment. Once the victim company starts a
dialog with their unique session key, the chat session is tagged with the corresponding build
comment on the LockBit management panel database.
3.1.3

Deployment and Execution

In this step, the LockBit ransomware generated by the affiliates is executed manually inside
the target company systems. Once the LockBit ransomware is executed in a system, it will
immediately begin the reconnaissance phase. In this phase of the ransomware attack. The
LockBit sample will try to enumerate all the accessible directories and network shares inside
the target system.
After the enumeration LockBit ransomware encrypts each file with a random AES key,
which is encrypted with the static public key inside the LockBit sample. Finally encrypted AES
key is inserted into a specific offset inside the file. Thus every file inside the target system is
encrypted with a different key, and each file can only be opened by the randomly generated
RSA private key during the build of the unique sample on the management panel.

Demand and Negotiation

At the end of the ransomware execution phase, all important files of the victim are encrypted,
backups are deleted, and the system wallpaper is changed to the following image.

”LockBit-note.hta” files on the target system desktop. The HTA file is executed automatically
upon creation. The ”LockBit-note.hta” file is a well-designed HTML page explaining the
situation and ways to contact the LockBit attackers for purchasing a decryptor software.

note contain a get parameter value formed by victims’ master and session keys. Once
the victims visit the LockBit website with the given unique link, they are greeted with the
following page.

Figure 9. LockBit victims’ landing page

The LockBit contact page contains ”CHAT WITH SUPPORT” and ”TRIAL DECRYPT” sections.
Victims are expected to get in contact with the LockBit attacker using the chat window
regarding the purchase of the decryptor software. Once a victim sends a message over
their unique contact URL, a new victim tab with the corresponding build comment shows
up on the LockBit management panel dashboard. The ”TRIAL DECRYPT” section inside the
victim dashboard allows the victims to decrypt a single file with a size smaller than 256KB.
This particular file must originate from the system with the corresponding ID (unique contact
URL). The LockBit panel automatically checks whether the given file actually belongs to
the corresponding victim ID and then serves the decrypted file to the victim. This feature
ensures the victims that LockBit attackers are able to decrypt their files successfully and in
an automated fashion.

3.2

Management Panel

During the investigation, the PTI Team was able to detect and gain access to some parts of
the LockBit RaaS infrastructure. The LockBit infrastructure consists of a management panel
hosted as a TOR hidden service website with the address http://lockbitaptku3l2q.onion/.
The management panel is mainly used for managing victims, affiliate accounts, generating
new ransomware builds, and serving the decryptor software if the demanded ransom is
payed.

As described in the previous step, the main dashboard of the LockBit management panel
contains the chat window. As can be seen in the following image, the LockBit affiliate often
starts the conversation with a prepared text that explains the situation briefly and informs
the victims about the current decryptor price, payment deadline, payment method (BTC),
and instructions about how to obtain bitcoin for payment.

Figure 11. LockBit management panel chat page

Affiliates also explain the ”TRIAL DECRYPT” mechanism to the victims because the trial decrypt
step is mandatory for purchasing the decryptor software. Each victim must upload a file for
trial decrypt in order to get the decryptor software. This mechanism prevents third-party
intervention and ensures that the negotiator actually has access to the victim’s files. On the
chat window there is a victim details button that displays the victim master and session keys,
first and last visit dates, total views, build date, and build comments. The following image
contains the mentioned victim details window.

page.

Figure 13. LockBit management panel statistics page

Finally, inside the affiliate management dashboard chat window there is a ”Decrypt” button
for automatically generating the decryptor for that particular LockBit victim. In order to
successfully generate the decryptor, victims need to upload an encrypted file for trial
decryption. Once the decryptor is generated for that particular victim, the chat session gets
removed from the LockBit affiliate’s dashboard and the conversation ends.

address http://lockbitaptku3l2q.onion/bfdnffektc/.

3.3

LockBit Decryptor

Once the decrypt button is pressed for a victim on the management panel, a unique
decryptor EXE file is generated for that particular victim’s ID (master an session keys). If
the victim used the trial decryption attempt, the generated decryptor software link will be
displayed at the bottom of the victim’s chat page. From this point, victims can download
the decryptor EXE file and run inside their encrypted systems for decrypting their files.

According to the PTI Team analysis, decryptor software successfully decrypts the locked files
inside the victim’s system without performing any malicious activity.

3.4

De-Anonymization

The PTI Team also focused on revealing the identity of the LockBit affiliates, retailers, and
developers. The management panel analysis revealed much information about the LockBit
affiliates. As described in Section 3.2, the admin user is able to view and manage affiliate
accounts on the system. As can be seen in the following image, every affiliate account is
created with a Jabber contact address.

Table 1. Full List of LockBit Affiliate Information

The reconnaissance on the Jabber addresses and aliases of the affiliates revealed that
two of the threat actors might also be working for the Babuk [6] and REvil [10] ransomware
groups.
Detailed information about the connection between the two threat actors and other
ransomware groups is redacted due to ongoing investigation.
The analysis on the victims’ chat logs revealed several other BTC wallet addresses shared
additionally with some of the victims. The PTI Team is still conducting taint analysis on the
wallet addresses to detect shared spending or laundering attempts.

The PTI team was able to capture the 45.135.187.132 IP address on Monday, 22 March 2021,
at 21:30:03 UTC, which is the IP address of one of the LockBit developers. Based on our
observation, the IP is another proxy layer (probably a VPN) used before accessing the
TOR network. We were also able to identify the OS details of the hidden server during our
investigation. The hidden service host is found to be a Ubuntu server with the host name
”Fibonacci”.

LockBit RaaS Case Report

Statistics and Observations

According to the victim details obtained from each of the affiliate accounts on the LockBit
management panel, the PTI Team discovered that the LockBit RaaS platform has successfully
infected thousands of devices around the world. Almost all of the victims are enterprise
corporations. The average ransom amount is calculated to be roughly $85,000.

Figure 20. Sector distribution of victims

Victim sector distribution does not show a significant value for the investigation as criminal
groups buy accesses and scan vulnerable hosts almost in a random fashion. We can see that
more than 20% of the victims were operating in the software and services sector. Commercial
and professional services as well as the transportation sector were also highly targeted by
the LockBit group. However, it should be noted that the value of the ransom is determined
by the affiliate after various checks using online services. This value does not solely depend
on the sector of the victim.

Figure 21. Victim page view statistics

Page view statistics show us who the ransomware victims are . We can clearly see that the
activity peaked around the beginning of May 2021. The indicator also shows that on the 11th of
May, there were no page views. This might be caused by a fault, system upgrade, or a possible
DDOS attack. Several other ransomware groups were also presented in global articles around
these times, which might be another indicator of a possible server upgrade/transfer. The
server became active after the 12th of May, and the activity increased for the following week.
As the TOR hidden server reroutes the traffic to 127.0.0.1, the unique IP count is shown as 0
on most of the dates. Several deviations present local page hits (mainly from the developer
side).

Known Recruiter Profiles

Ransomware groups hire several people from deepweb/darknet forums to attract new
affiliates into their network. These recruiters generally create topics in well-known forums
and discussion boards. In order to become an affiliate, one must have high skills, motivation,
and good references who can verify the candidate. In the following examples, we present
several ”Call for Application” posts written by the LockBit recruiters.
On average, affiliates gain between 10%-30% commission from each ransom payment.

Psychological analysis
”Do you accept the terms of the contract ?”

It bears all the hallmarks of the final sentence of a success business conversation – albeit
preceded by :
”ALL YOUR DATA IS ENCRYPTED. To recover the data, you need a decryptor. The cost of the
decryptor is 1000 US dollars. Payment is accepted only in bitcoins. After payment, you will
receive a decryptor and instructions on how to counteract hacking. Your data will be
restored within 15-30 minutes. Do you accept the terms of the contract ?”

The sense of panic is spreading. Perhaps your whole business is thrown down a black hole,
and since you want to save your business and the data it has generated in terms of business
intelligence, you engage with the organised group whose business idea happens to be a

criminal one. They prey on the notion that your livelihood is under threat and you expect to
save it. Victim shaming is a powerful tool of persuasion.
Looking at Figure 9, one can not note the ”business as usual” atmosphere that is conveyed.
There ”What” and ”How” boxes adequately describe what happened and how you can
solve it. Like any proper vendor they offer a sample of their product – the victim is given an
opportunity to “TRIAL DECRYPT” one of the ransomed files. Similar to regular businesses they
offer ”CHAT WITH SUPPORT”, should you have any questions ...
We managed to acquire chat logs between the two parties i.e. the victims of extortion and
the perpetrators. In most cases, they start with the message above or a similar one and
follow a certain pattern : from duress, threats, and prof of data and payment instructions to
(almost) friendly advice.
Once the initial sense of helplessness settles, the victims reach out through the platform –
the chat forum – provided by the extortionists. What follows is rather a normal conversation
between two parties engaged in negotiations :
Negotiations :
”name the amount you are willing to pay”

”If you offer the amount and it suits us, we will make a deal”

Duress and threats :
”If you do not make a payment within 72 hours, we will start posting...”

”I will accept your offer if you pay within 12 hours ! Hurry up !”

”24 hours for payment, then the amount will increase to $30,000”

and :

”Attention ! Do not try to decrypt files with any other programs ! This is not possible and can
only damage your files !”

”Don’t mess with us”

To further their business case the perpetrators offer proof :
”Here’s a little proof that we’ve got hold of your data”

followed by a link.
Payment instructions :
”You can only pay with bitcoin. You can guide them through...”

followed by specific instructions and bitcoin wallet information.
Once the victim has provided the wallet to the perpetrators, they start to stall before they
engage in ransom jacking, from the simple
”wait” to
”the key production time is from 12 to 24 hours”
They also try to come across as if they are doing you a favor, similar to a regular business
transaction such as purchasing a insurance :
”After the payment, we will tell you the vulnerability and you will close it. A second attack
will be excluded”

Generally the conversations follow a pattern of standardised answers as seen above,
however one cannot refrain from thinking that they may be Star Wars fans : ”Look for options,
time you have.”
Crime as a service (CaaS) is in this case manifested as ransomware as a service (RaaS) –
a service provided by computer experts who happen to be part of criminal networks. It
is beyond the scope of this report to further describe the underworld of organised crime.
However, this is a highly organised and well-developed undertaking.
The chat logs indicate a pattern, comparable to a regular telemarketing call, where the
individual perpetrators have the freedom to offer discounts and manage deadlines while
still being in control. Considering the nature of the organizational chart of organised

crime, it cannot be disregarded that, as a management tool, the use of force, whether
implicitly or explicitly, is always a option. As for the victims, they all have their account
of what happened and the reason for accepting to pay the ransom. Regardless of the
circumstances and the justification for agreeing, paying ransom continues to fuel the industry.
”We appreciate your patience and understanding”

Money Flow

During our analysis, we investigated some of the wallet addresses and investigated
the money flow throughout the blockchain. We observed that the crime group frequently
uses CoinJoin mixing techniques (Wasabi wallet) and several money-laundering services to
obfuscate their transactions. In addition to that, closer inspection of the transactions shows
some of the money has been converted into different cryptocurrencies (Monero, Zcash) using
prevalent exchangers like Changenow, Simpleswap, etc. These results provide further support
for the idea that KYC/AML procedures are inadequate to stop the ransom payments due to
the nature of the operation. Some of the wallet addresses and received amounts are listed
in Table 2.

LockBit RaaS Case Report

Conclusion

There is a growing body of research that recognizes the methodologies of ransomware
attacks. Besides, the recent Colonial Pipeline attack showed how these attacks could be
dangerous in the physical world, apart from the cyber domain. In this report, we presented
the inner workings of one of the best-known ransomware group and helped many victims
recover their data. However, rapid acceptance of cryptocurrencies and shifting to remote
work will significantly increase these ransomware attacks in the near future. In order to
disrupt the operation of cybercriminals while tackling complex challenges, public and private
bodies need to work collaboratively. We believe that our research will shed light on the inner
structures of the cybercriminals and help others to identify the LockBit operatives’ external
connections (like ReVil) as a part of a broader investigation. As we also presented in our
research that some of the affiliates do not bother to decrypt the victim’s files even if they
were paid in full. Cybercriminals should not be trusted. We advise all potential victims not to
pay any ransom and report the incident to the authorities immediately. We also advise to
follow other ransomware prevention initiatives such as ”The No More Ransom Project” [8] to
get an up-to-date information about recent cases and decryption opportunities.
