Democratic voters in Florida reported receiving threatening emails Tuesday purportedly from
the violent, far-right group Proud Boys directing them to vote for President Donald Trump or
“we will come after you.”
The head of the Proud Boys in Florida said in an interview that his group was not responsible
for the email threats.
The FBI and the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office were investigating, according to sheriff’s
spokesman Art Forgey. The county elections office here said “dozens” of Democratic voters
complained they had received the emails. At least some registered Democrats did not.

This email was sent to registered Democrats in

Alachua County by a sender claiming to be from the Proud Boys, an extremist far-right group
established in 2016.
Registered Democrats who received the emails live in Alachua County – one of only nine
counties in Florida where Trump lost in 2016 and home to the University of Florida campus.
Later in the day Democrats elsewhere in Florida from Brevard, Charlotte and Clay counties
also reported receiving them.
The chairman of Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio of Miami, said his group did not send the emails.
He made the remarks in an interview with Fresh Take Florida, a news service operated by
the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. Tarrio said he was
cooperating with the FBI’s investigation.

“We don’t do mass emails,” Tarrio said. “This is definitely, definitely not us.”
Tarrio also said the Proud Boys had no history of being involved in voter intimidation.
“It’s just never been a thing,” he said.
Proud Boy groups and their affiliates have been encouraging their supporters in recent
weeks to join the Trump campaign’s Election Day operations, urging them to register as poll
watchers.
Florida is crucially important in the upcoming presidential election, and political polls show a
remarkably close race here in recent weeks.
“When I clicked it and read more, I was like, this has to be illegal,” said Jessica McCroan, 24,
of Gainesville, who received one of the emails before noon. She called police and county
election officials.
McCroan said she already voted by mail and was upset about what she described as voter
intimidation tactics.
“I just can’t believe that people are doing this, when we should be pushing people to vote,
not making them scared to go vote,” she said.
The email said it came from the Proud Boys, an extremist group active in Florida that has
openly supported Trump and has engaged in violent clashes in cities around the United
States. Among the group’s supporters is Roger Stone, an occasional adviser to Trump who
was convicted on charges of witness tampering and lying to investigators. Trump commuted
his sentence this summer.
Stone, who lives in Florida, did not immediately respond to an email or a phone call to his
lawyer’s office.
When Trump was asked about the Proud Boys during the presidential debate last month,
and whether he would condemn white supremacists, he answered: “Proud Boys, stand back
and stand by.” He said the following day that he had intended to tell the group to “stand
down.”
In the email, the perpetrators ominously claimed to have “gained access into the entire voting
infrastructure,” but that boast appeared exaggerated: Thousands of registered Democrats in
Florida include their email addresses and phone numbers in the state’s voter registration
records, which are publicly available to anyone who requests them.
The email also warned recipients by name that the group knew their address, email address,
telephone number and “everything” – however, those details are generally included in the
same voter registration records.

“We will know which candidate you voted for,” the email said, though ballot selections are
secret under Florida law. The email directed Democrats to change their party affiliation to
Republican “to let us know you received our message and will comply.”
Attempting to threaten or intimidate voters in federal elections is a federal crime punishable
by fines and up to one year in prison.
A computer scientist at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, Max Zinkus, examined the
routing information inside one of the threatening emails and said it traced back to a computer
server in Saudi Arabia. He said the email appeared to be created on a management
interface common on older web servers with known software vulnerabilities that render them
accessible to hackers.
Zinkus said it’s possible the digital breadcrumbs on the emails were falsified to throw off
investigators. “It’s also possible that someone compromised a device and used it to connect
to this Saudi server, or compromised the Saudi server itself, or both,” said Zinkus, a doctoral
student who studies security, privacy and cryptography.
The emails were made to appear they were sent from a computer server associated with the
officialproudboys.com internet address, but control over that account – which was originally
created in March 2017 – was changed Monday night, according to internet records. That
website was offline by Tuesday afternoon.
The identities of those behind the officialproudboys.com address was shielded in internet
records, but they used an email address with a German suffix and were customers of the
company 1&1 IONOS Inc. of Chesterfield, Pennsylvania. A company spokesman wrote in an
email after publication of this story that 1&! IONOS has not been contacted by the FBI and
that it no longer hosts the website or domain.
Editor’s error/correction appended: A previous version of this story stated that Stone was
imprisoned after his conviction. He was not, as Trump commuted his sentence days before
Stone was to report to prison.
