Original Article
On May 23rd 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and Cisco Talos publicly announced the disruption of a novel multi-stage modular
malware platform called VPNFilter. This was designed to infect small office and home office
1/11

(SOHO) routers and other network devices. At the time, VPNFilter was believed to be
operated by the threat actor known as APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm,
Sandworm, Sofacy Group, Sednit X-Agent, STRONTIUM and Tsar Team), which was
allegedly associated with the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU). You can read more
about that sinkholing effort in our original 2018 blog post, which includes links to supporting
technical information.
Since then, we have continued notifying VPNFilter victims about infected devices worldwide
via Shadowserver’s free daily network reports.
In January 2021, we collaborated with partner Trend Micro on a joint analysis of the
remaining global VPNFilter victim population. This added some further scan-based insights
about third stage victim prevalence into our daily datasets.
From our vantage point as sinkhole operators, the peak day for VPNFilter infections globally
was 2018-07-24, which saw 14,966 unique IP addresses being observed hitting the sinkhole.
After the initial fairly rapid (by global Internet response standards) remediation of infected
devices, a typical long tail of not yet remediated victims still remains today:

Note the lack of variation in the daily/weekly number of detected IP addresses. As expected,
this suggests that the infected devices are always-on routers (which is unlike the typical
overnight or weekend patterns of change we usually see in sinkholed home or office PCs).
The IP-geolocated distribution of sinkholed VPNFilter unique IP addresses on that peak day
was:

With Ukraine having by far and away the most infected victim devices.
This compares to the current sinkholed VPNFilter IP address distribution observed
yesterday:

Cyclops Blink replaces VPNFilter
On February 23rd 2022, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) jointly announced that they had identified that the
3/11

threat actor known as Sandworm or Voodoo Bear has deployed a new, large-scale modular
malware framework which is affecting network devices. They have named the malware
Cyclops Blink. The NCSC, CISA, FBI and NSA have previously attributed the Sandworm
threat actor to the Russian GRU’s Main Centre for Special Technologies GTsST.
The Cyclops Blink malware is believed to be a more advanced replacement for VPNFilter. It
is installed on exploited network devices as part of a legitimate firmware upgrade, allowing
persistence between reboots. The UK NCSC’s analysis explains that it is possible to
recalculate the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) value for the modified
firmware image because the WatchGuard FireBox devices use a hard-coded key to initialize
the hash calculation. This allows their malware to pass checks and appear to be legitimate,
vendor-supplied firmware updates.
Infected victims’ devices are grouped into clusters, each with a list of Command and Control
(C2) servers. They communicate with their operators using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
running over The Onion Router (Tor) network. To date, Cyclops Blink malware is believed to
have been primarily deployed onto WatchGuard firewall devices (which are Linux ELF 32-bit
PowerPC big-endian platforms), and all C2 servers identified to date have been for
WatchGuard firewalls. However, the assessment published today indicates that it is likely that
the Cyclops Blink malware could also be compiled and deployed onto other architectures
and firmware. This botnet appears to have been active since at least June 2019.
A detailed technical analysis of Cyclops Blink by the UK NCSC can be found here, which
includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and YARA signatures to assist in detection.

Cyclops Blink Malware Remediation
WatchGuard have provided remediation information for system owners infected with the
Cyclops Blink malware:
https://detection.watchguard.com
WatchGuard estimate that Cyclops Blink malware may have infected approximately 1% of
WatchGuard firewall devices. They advise that the default configuration is to prevent access
to their management interface from the Internet, so this configuration must be manually
enabled by the system administrator.
All WatchGuard device owners should follow each step in these instructions to ensure that
devices are patched to the latest version and that any infection is removed.
If your device is identified as infected with Cyclops Blink, you should assume that any
passwords present on the device have been compromised and replace them
immediately.
You should ensure that the management interfaces of your network devices are not
exposed to the Internet.

UPDATES 2022-03-25 and 2022-04-01: Asus have also provided remediation information
and updated firmaware for impacted customers.

Shadowserver Cyclops Blink Special Report
We send out Special Reports whenever we are able to share one-time, high value datasets
that we feel should be reported responsibly for maximum public benefit. Although the events
included in these Special Reports sometimes fall outside of our usual 24-hour daily reporting
window, we believe that there would still be significant benefit to our constituents in receiving
and hopefully acting on the data.
On February 23rd 2022, we sent out a new Special Report covering network devices that are
believed to be likely infected with the Cyclops Blink malware. This one off Cyclops Blink
Special Report contained:
1,573 unique victim IP addresses in 495 different Autonomous System Numbers
(ASNs) across 70 different countries
25 Command and Control (C2) server IP addresses in 19 different Autonomous System
Numbers (ASNs) in 7 different countries
A direct link to the Cyclops Blink Special Report format is here.

Cyclops Blink Data Visualisation
The data contained in this new Cyclops Blink Special Report was provided to Shadowserver
to disseminate rapidly to National CERTs/CSIRTs and network owners globally, to maximise
remediation efforts.
Of the 1,573 IPv4 addresses included in the Cyclops Blink Special Report, the majority of
likely infected network devices IP-geolocate as being located in the United States, Canada
and Central Europe:

Looking at the data in another way, more than half of the network devices believed to be
infected with Cyclops Blink malware are located in the United States, France, Italy, Canada
and Germany:

Figure 5 – Tree Map of likely Cyclops Blink infected devices (2022-02-23)
Shadowserver conducts daily Internet-wide scanning of all IPv4 /0, which includes
identification of Internet facing devices, where possible, thanks to the EU HaDEA VARIoT
project. We began making this information available to National CERT/CSIRTs and Network
Owners who subscribe to our free daily network reports in the form of our Daily Device
Identification Report in September 2021, which can be used to establish your exposed attack
surface. We highly recommend subscribing and reviewing this report for your network, since
this is the same profile an attacker scanning to perform reconnaissance from the outside will
also see.
The location of the likely Cyclops Blink infected devices generally matches our scan-based
understanding of the global distribution WatchGuard firewall devices which are currently
exposed to the Internet:

scan)

Figure 9 – Identified WatchGuard firewall devices detected – World (2022-02-22 IPv4 /0
scan)

Figure 10 – Identified WatchGuard firewall device models – World (2022-02-22 IPv4 /0 scan)
Shadowserver’s daily scanning will obviously not detect all WatchGuard devices. However,
comparing the 1,573 unique IP addresses reported out as potentially infected with Cyclops
Blink malware to the number of publicly exposed systems identified through scanning, does
represent similar orders of magnitude to the 1% infection ratio suggested by WatchGuard.

Cyclops Blink C2 Server Distribution
9/11

In addition to the 1,573 IPv4 addresses corresponding to likely infected victim network
devices included in our Cyclops Blink Special Report, 25 Cyclops Blink C2 servers have also
been identified:
