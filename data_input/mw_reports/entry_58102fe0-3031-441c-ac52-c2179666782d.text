SEOUL, Dec 12 (Reuters) - When Daniel DePetris, a U.S.-based foreign affairs analyst,
received an email in October from the director of the 38 North think-tank commissioning an
article, it seemed to be business as usual.
It wasn't.

The sender was actually a suspected North Korean spy seeking information, according to
those involved and three cybersecurity researchers.
Instead of infecting his computer and stealing sensitive data, as hackers typically do, the
sender appeared to be trying to elicit his thoughts on North Korean security issues by
pretending to be 38 North director Jenny Town.
"I realized it wasn't legit once I contacted the person with follow up questions and found out
there was, in fact, no request that was made, and that this person was also a target,"
DePetris told Reuters, referring to Town. "So I figured out pretty quickly this was a
widespread campaign."
The email is part of a new and previously unreported campaign by a suspected North Korean
hacking group, according to the cybersecurity experts, five targeted individuals and emails
reviewed by Reuters.
The cybersecurity experts suspect the hackers are targeting people who are influential in
foreign governments to better understand where Western policy is headed on North Korea.
The hacking group, which researchers dubbed Thallium or Kimsuky, among other names,
has long used “spear-phishing” emails that trick targets into giving up passwords or clicking
attachments or links that load malware. Now, however, it also appears to simply ask
researchers or other experts to offer opinions or write reports.
According to emails reviewed by Reuters, among the other issues raised were China’s
reaction in the event of a new nuclear test; and whether a "quieter" approach to North
Korean "aggression" might be warranted.
"The attackers are having a ton of success with this very, very simple method," said James
Elliott of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), who added that the new tactic first
emerged in January. "The attackers have completely changed the process."
MSTIC said it had identified "multiple" North Korea experts who have provided information to
a Thallium attacker account.
A 2020 report by U.S. government cybersecurity agencies said Thallium has been operating
since 2012 and "is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence
gathering mission."
Thallium has historically targeted government employees, think tanks, academics, and
human rights organisations, according to Microsoft.
"The attackers are getting the information directly from the horse's mouth, if you will, and
they don't have to sit there and make interpretations because they're getting it directly from
the expert," Elliott said.

NEW TACTICS
North Korean hackers are well-known for attacks netting millions of dollars, targeting Sony
Pictures over a film seen as insulting to its leader, and stealing data from pharmaceutical and
defence companies, foreign governments, and others.
North Korea's embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment, but it has
denied being involved in cyber crime.
In other attacks, Thallium and other hackers have spent weeks or months developing trust
with a target before sending malicious software, said Saher Naumaan, principal threat
intelligence analyst at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.
But according to Microsoft, the group now also engages with experts in some cases without
ever sending malicious files or links even after the victims respond.
This tactic can be quicker than hacking someone's account and wading through their emails,
bypasses traditional technical security programmes that would scan and flag a message with
malicious elements, and allows the spies direct access to the experts' thinking, Elliott said.
"For us as defenders, it's really, really hard to stop these emails," he said, adding that in most
cases it comes down to the recipient being able to figure it out.
Town said some messages purporting to be from her had used an email address that ended
in ".live" rather than her official account, which ends in ".org", but had copied her full
signature line.
In one case, she said, she was involved in a surreal email exchange in which the suspected
attacker, posing as her, included her in a reply.
DePetris, a fellow with Defense Priorities and a columnist for several newspapers, said the
emails he has received were written as if a researcher were asking for a paper submission or
comments on a draft.
"They were quite sophisticated, with think tank logos attached to the correspondence to
make it look as if the inquiry is legitimate," he said.
About three weeks after receiving the faked email from 38 North, a separate hacker
impersonated him, emailing other people to look at a draft, DePetris said.
That email, which DePetris shared with Reuters, offers $300 for reviewing a manuscript
about North Korea's nuclear programme and asks for recommendations for other possible
reviewers. Elliot said the hackers never paid anyone for their research or responses, and
would never intend to.

GATHERING INFORMATION
Impersonation is a common method for spies around the world, but as North Korea's
isolation has deepened under sanctions and the pandemic, Western intelligence agencies
believe Pyongyang has become particularly reliant on cyber campaigns, one security source
in Seoul told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.
In a March 2022 report, a panel of experts that investigates North Korea's U.N. sanctions
evasions listed Thallium's efforts as among activities that "constitute espionage intended to
inform and assist" the country's sanctions avoidance.
Town said in some cases, the attackers have commissioned papers, and analysts had
provided full reports or manuscript reviews before realising what had happened.
DePetris said the hackers asked him about issues he was already working on, including
Japan's response to North Korea's military activities.
Another email, purporting to be a reporter from Japan's Kyodo News, asked a 38 North
staffer how they thought the war in Ukraine factored in North Korea's thinking, and posed
questions about U.S., Chinese, and Russian policies.
"One can only surmise that the North Koreans are trying to get candid views from think
tankers in order to better understand U.S. policy on the North and where it may be going,"
DePetris said.
