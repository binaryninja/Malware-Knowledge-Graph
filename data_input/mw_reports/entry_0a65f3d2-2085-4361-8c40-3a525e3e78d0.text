Some EU Member States have observed malicious cyber activities, collectively designated
as Ghostwriter, and associated these with the Russian state. Such activities are
unacceptable as they seek to threaten our integrity and security, democratic values and
principles and the core functioning of our democracies.
These malicious cyber activities are targeting numerous members of Parliaments,
government officials, politicians, and members of the press and civil society in the EU by
accessing computer systems and personal accounts and stealing data. These activities are
contrary to the norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace as endorsed by all UN
Member States, and attempt to undermine our democratic institutions and processes,
including by enabling disinformation and information manipulation.
The European Union and its Member States strongly denounce these malicious cyber
activities, which all involved must put to an end immediately. We urge the Russian
Federation to adhere to the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.
The European Union will revert to this issue in upcoming meetings and consider taking
further steps.
