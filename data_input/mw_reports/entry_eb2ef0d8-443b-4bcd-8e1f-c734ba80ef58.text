THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTS

ABSTRACT
This report investigates a campaign of targeted malware attacks that has successfully
compromised 1465 computers in 61 different countries. Based on the project path
embedded in the malware, we have named this speciﬁc campaign “Lurid Downloader”
although the malware is typically known as “Enfal”. The majority of the victims are
located in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS). We were able to identify 47 victims that include numerous government ministries
and diplomatic missions along with space-related government agencies, companies
and research institutions in Russia and other members of the CIS along with a smaller
amount of similar entities in Europe.
The threat actors behind “Lurid Downloader” launched 301 malware campaigns
targeting entities in speciﬁc countries or geographic regions and tracked the success
of each campaign by embedding a unique identiﬁer in each instance of malware and
associating it with speciﬁc victims. While some campaigns resulted in numerous
victims, others were very speciﬁc and targeted resulting in only one or two victims.
While previous Enfal activity has been typically associated with threat actors in China, it
remains unclear who is behind the Lurid Downloader attacks.

INTRODUCTION
Prior to the highly publicized “Aurora” attack on Google in late 2009, which also
affected at least 20 other companies, there was little public awareness regarding
targeted malware attacks1. However, such attacks have been taking place for years
and continue to affect government, military, corporate, educational, and civil society
networks today. While such attacks against the U.S. government and related networks
are now fairly well-known, other governments and an increasing number of companies
are facing similar threats. Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of
Independent States are also being targeted and compromised. These countries have
an expertise in the space industry and also have operations in oil & gas, mining and
other industry areas that have been targeted by malware attacks in the past.
Malware attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in popular software in order to compromise
speciﬁc target sets are becoming increasingly commonplace. These attacks are not
automated or indiscriminate nor are they conducted by opportunistic amateurs. Known
as targeted malware attacks, these attacks refer to computer intrusions staged by
threat actors that aggressively pursue and compromise speciﬁc targets. Targeted
malware attacks are typically part of broader campaigns, a series of failed and success
compromises, by speciﬁc threat actors and not isolated attacks.
However, the speciﬁcity of the attacker’s prior knowledge of the victim affects the level
of targeting associated with a single attack. As a result, some attacks appear to be
less precise, or “noisy”, and are aimed at a broader community. Such “spear phishing”
attacks are usually “directed toward a group of people with a commonality” as opposed
to a speciﬁc target but are useful for gaining an initial foothold in a future target of
interest2.
The malware used in the “Lurid Downloader” attacks is commonly known as “Enfal”
and it has been used in targeted attacks as far back as 20063. In 2008, Maarten Van
Horenbeeck documented a series of targeted malware attacks that made use the Enfal
Trojan to target non-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) as well as defense contractors and U.S. government employees4. In 2009
and 2010, researchers from the University of Toronto published reports on two cyberespionage networks known as “GhostNet” and “ShadowNet” that included malware
and command and control infrastructure connected with the Enfal Trojan5. The
domain names used by Enfal as command and control servers are, according to U.S.
diplomatic cables leaked to Wikileaks, linked to a series of attacks known as “Byzantine
Hades.” According to these leaked cables, the activity of this set of threat actors has
been ongoing since 2002 and is known as “Byzantine Hades”, and there are subsets
of this activity known as “Byzantine Anchor,” “Byzantine Candor” and “Byzantine
Foothold”6. However, it is important to note that other than the use of Enfal itself,
there appears to be several distinct sets of command and control infrastructure in use
and the relationship among the threat actors operating these separate infrastructures
remains unclear.
The “Lurid Downloader” attacks appear to be another separate, but related Enfal
network with a geographic focus. While there is clear evidence that the Tibetan
community is also target, the victims of this attack are concentrated in Russia and
other CIS countries. Numerous embassies and government ministries have been
compromised as well as research institutions and agencies related to the space
industry.

Our investigation began with an analysis of the “Lurid Downloader” malware. Our
objective was to document its functionality and map out its command and control
network. While this malware family is well known, there appear to be various
associated threat actors using it to compromise targets in various geographic locations.
Similar versions of this malware have been used to target both the U.S. government
and NGO’s in the past. We could ﬁnd no direct links between this particular command
and control network and the previously discovered ones; we believe that it is most likely
a separate, but related network as they appear to each have a regional focus.
We uncovered a command and control network that consists of 15 domains names
and 10 IP addresses. We were able to retrieve a listing of the compromised computers
connecting to these servers. In total, we found 1465 unique hosts (Hostname + Mac
address as stored by the C&C) with 2272 unique external IP addresses connecting to
the command and control network primarily from Russia (1063), Kazakhstan (325) and
Ukraine (102) along with numerous other countries in the CIS (former Soviet Union).
We were able to use reverse DNS and WHOIS lookups to determine the identity
of 47 compromised hosts. From the victims we were able to identify, there were
concentrations of government ministries and diplomatic missions as well as spacerelated government agencies, companies and research institutions.
We found that the attackers embedded campaign codes inside the malware they
propagated in order to keep track of the success of their campaigns. In total, we
found 301 campaign codes and there are high concentrations of victims within a single
country for each instance of the malware campaign indicating that the distribution of
the malware is targeted at speciﬁc countries or regions. In addition, nearly 60% of the
campaigns only affected 1 or 2 victims indicating the precision with which the malware
campaigns were conducted.

ATTACK VECTOR
In a typical targeted malware attack, a target typically receives a socially engineered
message – such as an email or instant message – that encourages the target to click
on a link or open a ﬁle. The links and ﬁles sent by the attacker contain malicious code
that exploits vulnerabilities in popular software such as Adobe Reader (e.g. pdf’s) and
Microsoft Ofﬁce (e.g. doc’s). The payload of these exploits is malware that is silently
executed on the target’s computer. This allows the attackers to take control of the
computer and obtain data from it. The attackers may then move laterally throughout the
target’s network and are often able to maintain control over compromised computers
for extended periods of time. Ultimately, the attacks locate and ex-ﬁltrate sensitive
information from the victim’s network.
In this case, the delivery mechanism used was an email with a malicious PDF as an
attachment. The email had no content, just a subject line and an attachment. The
email message was spoofed to appear to be from ohhdl@dalailama.com, the Ofﬁce
of the Dalai Lama and had a subject of “Tibetan Losar Event on 6 March 2011”. It also
contained an attachment named “LOSAR FLYER_edited-3.pdf”.
The email was sent using an email provider called Gawab (gawab.com) which is
popular in the Middle East. The server used was info3.gawab.com (66.220.20.18)
and the email address was emb107@gawab.com. The originating IP address was:
96.46.11.88 (INTERNETXTUSA). While this IP address is assigned to the US, it is used
by a VPN provider in China7.
If the attached PDF is opened with older versions of Adobe reader, malicious code
is executed that drop malware on the target’s system. The malware then connects to
a command and control server under the attacker’s control. At this time, the target’s
computer is compromised and under the full control of the attackers.

After successful exploitation, two malware components are created. One is a dropper
(ctfmon.exe) that installs a windows service. The service loads the dropped dll ﬁle
mspmsnsr.dll<long string of characters>. The malicious Windows service stores its
conﬁguration settings in the registry:
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WmdmPmSp\Parameters
This malware identiﬁes itself as version 2.14. During the course of our investigation, we
discovered another version of the malware that identiﬁes itself as version 2.15.

WORM_OTORUN.TMP

Instead of a Windows service, version 2.15 is just a single executable that copies itself
to the system folder and ensures persistence by changing the common start folder of
windows to a special one it creates. It then copies all the usual auto-start items there,
as well as itself. The existence of this folder is constantly checked and redone if the
user or any program switches it back to normal.
The Trojan collects information from the computer and sends it via HTTP POST. The
information it collects is the following:
• Computer name
• MAC address
• computer OS and version
• IP address and codepage
• language of the operating system.
It constantly communicates with a C&C server to perform certain info-stealing tasks.
The main feature of the Trojan is that all communication is started by the client by http.
Firewalls and other security devices will never see any communication from outside
in. Even the interactive command line is built this way so everything is done from the
inside out. The communication is always encrypted although it’s a simple XOR singlebyte encryption. This means that network security devices won’t readily see anything
suspicious going on.

COMMUNICATION WITH THE COMMAND AND CONTROL SERVER
When malware is executed on the target’s system it “checks in” with one or more
servers under the control of the attackers. Command and control mechanisms allow the
threat actors to conﬁrm that an attack has succeeded in addition to supplying them with
some information about the target’s computer and network. From here on, the client
communicates back to the control server expecting a command, allowing the attackers
to issue commands to the compromised target.
All of the connections to the command and control servers use the HTTP protocol and
request speciﬁc URL paths. On startup, the malware connects to the command and
control server and requests the path “/trandocs/mm/” (the path may differ with other
samples, for example “httpdocs/mm/ or /iupw82/netstate”). This appears to be a LOGIN
connection and the server always responds with “123”. The data transmitted to the
command and control server consists of the following:
Encrypted Password/<hostname>:<MAC>/<ip address>
<OS name>
<codepage>:<locale>
<actual exe name>
<campaign name>
<y/n> (sys32time.ini exists? Is it 1Mb or bigger?)
<y/n> (ipop.dll exists?)
<y/n> (always n in our samples)
<malware version> (2.14 or 2.15)
The encrypted password at the beginning of the LOGIN packet only appears on version
2.15. The sample we analyzed contains the password “hallelujah” and it is encrypted
with “ADD +FAh”. The earlier version, 2.14, does not contain a password at all.
After the initial connection, the malware makes two kinds of connections to the
command and control server every 2 minutes. The ﬁrst connection is a KEEPALIVE
connection to the URL path “/cgl-bin/Owpq4.cgi”. The malware posts information to the
command and control server that identiﬁes the compromised machine: OS and version,
“campaign ID” and malware version. The second connection is an ASKCMD connection
to a URL with the path “/trandocs/mm/ <machine_name>:<MAC address>/Cmwhite”.
The contents of “Cmwhite” contain commands that are sent by the attackers to the
compromised computer. The range of possible commands will be discussed below.
When the command ﬁle, “Cmwhite” is downloaded, the malware ﬁrst acknowledges the
receipt of the command by issuing an ACKCMD connection to “/cgl-bin/Clnpp5.cgi”.
Once the command is interpreted and performed, the malware issues a CMDDONE
request to “/cgl-bin/Rwpq1.cgi”. It contains the results of the command and, if relevant,
a result code that indicates any error encountered. When there is no command set
by the attackers for the victim computer, the command and control server returns a
“404 NOT FOUND” error page. This is never interpreted correctly as a command and
therefore ignored.

COMMANDS
The command packet that is contained within the “Cmwhite” response is encrypted. In
the samples we analyzed, it is encrypted with XOR 45h. Other communication packets
observed suggest that there are other keys in use but they are always a single byte.
Once decrypted, this is what a command packet contains:
First two bytes: 40 40. (This is just a magic number).
Third byte: Command code.
Fourth byte: Return code. (This only used in the CMDDONE packet to indicate
error/success).
From the Fifth byte on, the command carries parameters, which vary depending
on the nature of the command.
The range of commands available to the attackers that are enumerated below
demonstrate the level of control the attackers have over their victims. In addition to
functionality that allows the attackers to send and receive ﬁles, they are able to activate
an interactive remote shell on compromised systems.
Range of commands

ESEARCH PAPER

Command 01

ECHO

It echoes back the word contained in bytes 5 and 6. There’s another
parameter, which is supposed to contain the string “ibme54”. If this
is right, it keeps an internal counter of how many of these ECHO
packets, it has received.

Command 02

IPOP LOAD CHECK

It checks if the previous check for the ﬁle c:\windows\system32\ipop.
dll was successful. It returns a y/n condition.

Command 03

SEND FILE

When the client receives this command, it retrieves a ﬁle and sends
it to the C&C server. The ﬁlename is a parameter in the command
packet.

Command 04

RECV FILE

This command has two parameters, the ﬁlename and the data. The
client creates the ﬁle with the data in the packet. It does this by
constantly communicating with a Ufwhite URL. This URL is accessed
repeatedly in order to keep receiving chunks of the data ﬁle and
appending it to the ﬁle. When there’s no more data, the ﬁle is closed
and operation is ﬁnished. After each packet is correctly received,
the client sends a report packet to Clnpp5.cgi specifying that it was
Ufwhite who started this operation.

Command 05

CMDEXEC

It accepts a single command and executes it in the victim system.

Command 06

DELETE FILE

It accepts a ﬁlename string as a parameter. It deletes the ﬁle.

Command 07

MOVE FILE

It accepts two ﬁlenames. It moves the ﬁle from source to target
destination.

Command 09

LS

When the client receives this command, its proceeds to list the ﬁles
within a speciﬁed directory and sends the list back in a response
packet.

Command 0A

When the client receives this command, it stays in interactive mode.
It starts connecting to Clnpp5.cgi expecting a command. These
commands are then executed and error codes sent straight away
until an “exit” command is received. The interactive commands
have a special tag to set them apart from regular commands. This
tag is “1234”. The way this interactive system is implemented is the
INTERACTIVE MODE
following: The command is run in the same way as command 05 but
the output is redirected to a ﬁle (c:\Documents and Settings\<user>\
SendTo\msacm.dat). The contents of the ﬁle are then sent in the
return packet to Clnpp5.cgi. Once the “exit” command has been
received, this mode is interrupted. While this mode is going on, the
Trojan still sends keepalive and regular command requests packets.

THE “LURID” DOWNLOADER

The “Lurid” Downloader
THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTS

Command 0B

MKDIR

The client creates a directory

Command 0E

TERMINATE
PROCESS

The client tries to terminate a given thread in the system.

Command 10

EXEC NFAL

When this command is received, the client tries to execute the ﬁle c:\
windows\system32\nfal.exe. This ﬁle does not exist on an infected
system normally so it must be a placeholder for a command ﬁle
uploaded to the victim.

Command 40

PING

When this command is received, the Trojan just sends back an empty
packet with a success code condition.

TOOL MARKS
The terms “tool marks” refers to characteristics contained within malware that indicate
that they are part of the same campaign or related to speciﬁc threat actors8. In this
case, the attackers left the PDB path in the malware samples we analyzed which
indicate the name of the project:
e:\programs\LuridDownLoader\LuridDownloader for
Falcon\DllServiceTrojan\Release\DllServiceTrojan.pdb
e:\programs\LuridDownLoader\LuridDownloader for Falcon\ServiceDll\Release\
ServiceDll.pdb
We named this campaign of targeted attacks “Lurid DownLoader” based on the project
name the attackers have given to their own malware.

COMMAND AND CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE
Attackers often maintain a network of command and control servers, not just a single
one. Often, the malware used in targeted attacks contains one or more command and
control locations. By linking together the domain names that are present in related
malware samples, along with domain names registered by the same email address and
domain names hosted on the same web servers we were able to map out the command
and control infrastructure of the attackers.
In total, we found 15 domain names associated with the attackers and 10 active IP
addresses. The domain names were registered by two different email addresses
“bruce_tuner@yahoo.com” and “icqmaster@163.com”.

Rather than use the “root” domains, the attackers use a variety of sub-domains. These
various sub-domains resolve to 10 different IP address spread across 3 different
IP address ranges assigned to 2 providers: Krypt Technologies in the U.S. and
UK2/100mb in the U.K.

COMPROMISED ORGANIZATIONS
After mapping out and monitoring the command and control network used in this
campaign we were able to retrieve a listing of the compromised computers connecting
to these servers. This list of compromised computers contains 1465 unique hosts
(Hostname + Mac address as stored by the C&C) with 2272 unique external IP
addresses connecting to the command and control network primarily from Russia
(1063), Kazakhstan (325) and Ukraine (102) along with numerous other countries in
the CIS (former Soviet Union). There were also signiﬁcant numbers of compromises
in Vietnam, India, Mongolia and China. In total, there were victims in 61 different
countries.

MALWARE CAMPAIGNS
As noted earlier, there is a unique identiﬁer built in to instances of the malware sent
out by the attackers that allows them to keep track of the computers compromised
by speciﬁc campaigns. In total, we found 301 campaign codes. This means that the
attackers sent out at least 301 different instances of the “Lurid Downloader.” There are
high concentrations of victims within a single country for each instance of the malware
campaign indicating that the distribution of the malware is targeted at speciﬁc countries
or regions.

There were also speciﬁc campaigns that affected a very small number of victims. In
fact, nearly 60% (59.4%) of all the campaigns affected only 1 or 2 victims. There
were 115 campaigns that only compromised 1 victim and 64 campaigns that only
compromised 2 victims. This indicates the precision in malware campaigns that target
speciﬁc entities.

DATA EX-FILTRATION
While we were unable to recover the data obtained by the attackers, we were able to
collect some of the command issued by the attackers that hint at their objectives. We
found that the attackers often issued the “LS” command to send a directory listing from
speciﬁc directories on the compromised computers back to the command and control
server. We also observed the use of the “SEND FILE” that ordered the compromised
computers to compress, split and upload speciﬁc ﬁles (.rar, .xls, .doc) to the command
and control server. However, we were unable to recover the ex-ﬁltrated data.

ATTRIBUTION
Determining who is ultimately behind targeted malware attacks is difﬁcult as it requires
a combination of technical and contextual analysis and the ability to connect disparate
pieces of information together over a period of time. Moreover, any one researcher
typically does not necessarily have all these pieces of information and must interpret
the available evidence. Too often, the determination of attribution is based on easily
spoofed evidence such as IP addresses. While many of these attacks are attributed to
China, in this case, the IP addresses of the command and control servers were located
in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the registration information
of the domain names used indicates that the owners are in China. In either case, the
information is not difﬁcult to manipulate.
The use of “Enfal”, the family of malware to which “Lurid Downloader” belongs, has
been historically linked with threat actors in China. In this case, the attack vector
that we were able to analyze was related to the Tibetan community which indicates
an association with China. However, China was also a victim of “Lurid Downloader.”

CONCLUSION
In this report we have analyzed targeted malware attacks that have compromised
sensitive locations in Russia, CIS countries and around the world. The focus of the
attacks appears to be on government networks and diplomatic missions as well and
research institutions and space related agencies. We found that the attackers engaged
in over 300 campaigns and kept careful records of their victims and to what campaign
compromised them. Our analysis of the campaigns reveals that attackers engage
in attacks that target communities in speciﬁc geographic locations as well extremely
targeted campaigns that only affect one or two victims.
The precise nature of targeted malware attacks increases the difﬁculty of defense. With
signiﬁcant reconnaissance, and possibly information gained from previously successful
incursions into the target’s network, the threat actors behind targeted malware attacks
are able to customize their attacks to increase the probability of success. Therefore,
defenses against targeted malware attacks need to focus on detection and mitigation
and not simply on prevention.
Through the exposure of the “Lurid Downloader” network, we aim to enable a better
understanding of the extent and frequency of such attacks as well as the challenges
that targeted malware attacks pose for traditional defenses. Defensive strategies can
be dramatically improved by understanding how targeted malware attacks work as well
as trends in the tools, tactics and procedures of the threat actors behind such attacks.
By effectively using threat intelligence derived from external and internal sources
combined with security tools that empower human analysts, organizations are better
positioned to detect and mitigate targeted malware attacks.
