The samples were clearly malicious and varied in sophistication. All three samples provided remote access
to the attacker, via two Command and Control (C2) servers. One sample is typical of what is commonly
referred to as a ‚Äòdropper‚Äô because its primary purpose is to write a malicious component to disk and connect
it to the targeted hosts operating system. The malicious component in this case is what is commonly referred to as a Remote Access Tool (RAT), this RAT is manifested as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) installed
as a service. The second sample analyzed is a dual use tool that can function both as a post exploitation
tool used to infect other systems, download additional tools, remove log data, and itself be used as a
backdoor. The third sample was a sophisticated implant that in addition to having multiple communication
capabilities, and the ability to act as a relay for other infected hosts, utilized a kernel mode driver that can
hide aspects of the tool from user-mode tools. This third component is likely used for long-term
implantation and intelligence gathering. Some AV engines occasionally identify this sample as Derusbi
Trojan. CrowdStrike Intelligence Team has seen Trojans from 8 different builder variants of this RAT,
including 64-bit versions, used in targeted attacks in 2011 against Defense, Energy/Power, and Chemical
Industries in US and Japan.

Dropper Sample (MD5: 14c04f88dc97aef3e9b516ef208a2bf5)
The executable 14c04f88dc97aef3e9b516ef208a2bf5 is commonly referred to as a ‚Äòdropper‚Äô, which is
designed with the purpose of extracting from itself a malicious payload and to initialize and install it into a
targeted system. In this case, the malicious payload is a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL), which enables an
attacker to have full control of the system. This code appears to have been compiled on Wednesday May
4th, 2011 at 11:04:24 A.M. UTC (equivalent to early evening time in China). Note that the timestamp is in

resolves several library functions provided by Microsoft using the LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress()
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The imported function names are not encrypted; however, the
function name is minutely obfuscated by a simple single character substitution:
//Obfuscation of GetTempPathA() API function call
strcpy((char *)ProcName, ‚Äú2etTempPathA‚Äù);
ProcName[0] = ‚ÄòG‚Äô;
The dropper invokes the SHGetSpecialFolderPath() API supplying a Constant Special Item ID List (CSIDL)

service despite the appearance. If the service is present, the malware replaces its previous instances or
versions of this backdoor. After attempting to disable the existing service, the malware tries to install itself as
a service with that same name. During installation, the sample attempts to use documented APIs such as
OpenSCManager() and CreateService() to initialize itself as a persistent Windows service. As a
precaution, the sample writes settings directly to the Windows Registry to accomplish the same goal if
installing the service with the documented APIs fails. The registry change creates the following key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\msupdate\\Parameters
Following this, the subroutine will set the value of the ‚ÄòServiceDLL‚Äô to the module handle of the DLL.
The next key to be changed is:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost, which will have
the ‚Äòmsupdate‚Äô key set to ‚Äòmsupdate‚Äô.
The export ‚ÄòCollectW3PerfData‚Äô is registered as the main function of the DLL. If the installation of the new
service is successful, the sample then starts the new service and exits. If the installation fails, the sample

created thread initializes networking APIs using WSAStartup() and resolves some other APIs dynamically
using LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress(). Once the proper API‚Äôs have been resolved, the sample then
assigns a NULL SID to the rundll32.exe executable and sets the current process‚Äô Window Station to
‚Äúwinsta0‚Äù, which enables the sample to access the real user‚Äôs desktop if started as service.
The communication to the C2 is handled by a while() loop, with each successive connection attempt
causing the loop to invoke the Windows Sleep() API for a time interval of 2 seconds, exponentially
increasing in length up to 1024 seconds (17 minutes) and then restarting back to 2 seconds.

sequence. When a connection can successfully be established to the C2 server, the sleep timer is reset to
two seconds for the next attempt.

Network Protocol and Implementation

Backdoor Functionality, Supported Commands
The primary aim of this backdoor is remote desktop control functionality comparable to VNC or Remote
Desktop over a custom protocol. It allows the adversary to view the main desktop graphically and
control the keyboard and mouse. This remote control functionality is implemented as separate messages

0x22000001 initiates continuous transmission of screen captures to the C2. The screen captures are
created using a series of Microsoft Windows Graphic Device Interface (GDI) API calls culminating in a call to
GetDIBits().
Command 0x20000001 exits the backdoor and 0x20000000 is issued to completely remove the backdoor
from the system.

When command 0x23000004 is received, a temporary new user ‚Äú_DomainUser_‚Äù with password ‚ÄúDom4!nUserP4ss‚Äù is created and added to the local Administrators group. The backdoor is then started under that
account and the user is deleted. It would appear this technique is meant to obfuscate the activities of the
malicious sample by masking the process creator‚Äôs user name to appear to be a generic domain user. Note
that such an account does not normally exist in an Active Directory environment.
Additionally, the primary C2 connection allows for requests to start additional connections to the C2 implementing the following functionality:

Symantec AV engines.
This sample is a DLL which can be registered as a service and is used to drop a kernel driver and provide
an interactive command line shell to the C2. It also is able to bypass User Account Control (UAC) to install
itself by using the ‚Äòsysprep.exe‚Äô Microsoft Windows executable provided by the targeted system. The steps it
takes to install itself onto a system are as follows:
1. Copies itself to to %WINDIR%\system32\Msres<3 random characters>.ttf

5. If McAfee AV is installed, creates a copy of regsvr32.exe named Update.exe and then schedules
the copy to be deleted on reboot using the well documented MoveFileExA API.
6. It then calls either the original or copy of regsvr32.exe with the parameters /s /u and the path to
the copy of itself it made in Step 1. The /u parameter means ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù, which calls
DllUnregisterServer, this is an unsophisticated method of DLL entry point obfuscation.

After establishing any of the aforementioned channels for arbitrary binary data exchange, the malware will
start sending and receiving compressed binary blobs via the channel of choice. The C2‚Äôs binary data blobs
are compressed. No further encryption of the data takes place.
All C2 transport implementations contain code for accepting and handling server-side connections of the
respective protocols. However, this code does not appear to be invoked. It appears that the author of this
code shares the library that implements these transports for the client with the C2 server.

C2 Command Invocation
The main backdoor thread then reads commands from the chosen C2 protocol and passes them on to any
of the following registered handler classes based upon a command ID. The handler class is responsible for
parsing the remainder of the command.

PCC_PROXY: TCP Proxy
This handler class implements a generic TCP proxy. It supports establishing TCP connections to other hosts
and also listening for incoming connections. The incoming connection contents are forwarded to the C2 and
data from the C2 is passed on to connections. It supports up to 1024 parallel connections.
PCC_MISC : Gather and report system information
The malware is capable of gathering various pieces of information from the system, triggered by a command
ID 10. The capabilities include recovering authentication credentials from various system and client storage
such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Remote Access Service (RAS). This class also supports
gathering intelligence on the infected system including identifying security tools by their process name, proxy
accounts, and version numbers for the Operating System (OS) and Internet Explorer.
PCC_SYS: System Management
This handler class provides the attacker with the ability to manage system components including start/stop/
delete system services, enumerate/alter registry keys, and manage running processes. This class also
provides the ability for the attacker to take a screen shot of the users desktop.

This handler class uses the command ID 5 and implements an interactive command line shell accessible
from the C2 server, containing a series of built-in commands. If the input is not in this list of built-in
commands, the malware attempts to invoke cmd.exe in the background, launching a command or command

Kernel Driver Sample (MD5: dae6b9b3b8e39b08b10a51a6457444d8)
This sample is a packed 32-bit kernel driver extracted by the aforementioned DLL with an MD5 hash of:
de7500fc1065a081180841f32f06a537, this sample will only function on a Windows 32-bit kernel. This code
appears to have been compiled on Sunday October 9, 2011 at 4:50:31 P.M. UTC (very early morning time
of Monday, October 10 in China).

Entrypoint
This section describes how the driver performs its initialization routine.
Multiple Instance Protection
The driver begins by opening a named event in the BaseNamedObjects object directory with the name

and indicative of relatively limited Windows API knowledge of the author of that part of the code. It is
interesting to note that some of the hex digits in the object name are mixed case which is potentially
indicative of the code being re-appropriated from another source.
Anti-Debugging Protection
The second component of the entry point performs an anti-debugging technique, calling the function
KdDisableDebugger(), which allows the driver to disable usage of the built-in Windows kernel debugging
facility that is used by popular kernel debuggers KD and WinDbg. Tools such as Syser Debugger, or
debugging through a virtual machine are unaffected by this technique. The sample, rather than importing the
KdDisableDebugger() API using conventional methods, looks up the API through
MmGetSystemRoutineAddress() instead. All of the other APIs used by the driver are imported normally, so
this is not a technique to hide import APIs used throughout the driver. Searching Google for
‚ÄúMmGetSystemRoutineAddress‚Äù and ‚ÄúKdDisableDebugger‚Äù results in dozens of Chinese language blogs
which explain how to use this technique to ‚ÄúDisable WinDbg‚Äù.

the version is necessary because Windows versions beginning with Vista utilize a redesigned TCP/IP network stack, most hooking operations will require a different implementation for these versions. On versions
prior to Windows Vista, the TCP/IP driver creates a \Device\Tcp device object through which most network
requests are piped through. On Vista and later, TCP/IP has been split up into multiple components, and IP
connection enumeration, which this driver is targeting, is managed by \Device\nsiproxy instead.
In either case, the driver obtains the device object by using IoGetDeviceObjectPointer() and hooks Major
Function 14 the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL, as this is the function through which all Input Output
ConTroLls (IOCTLs) are sent, such as the IOCTL for querying active IP connections.
Network Store Interface (NSI) Hook
The NSI hook, targets IOCTL 0x12001B, which is used by NsiGetObjectAllParameters() in nsi.dll when
users typically run commands such as netstat.exe or use any of the IP Helper APIs in iphlpapi.dll. The
purpose of the hook is to scan the list of active connections returned to the user, and hide any such
connection currently bound to a local TCP port in

the range between 40000 and 45000. The hooking is performed by creating a new completion routine
associated with any IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL IRP that matches the IOCTL, attaching to the target
process, performing several memory copies to hide the entry, and detaching.
This functionality is nearly identical to the code posted by Edward Sun (aka cardmagic, sunmy1@sina.com,

DWORD at each of these exported functions. Because the system call stub uses the EAX register as an
index for the system call ID, and a ‚Äúmov eax, imm32‚Äù instruction‚Äù instruction is used, this second DWORD
will match the system call ID. It then adds this index to the value of KeServiceDescriptorTable.Base, which
is the exported kernel variable (on 32-bit Windows only) which directly points to the system call table. This is
one of the simplest ways to do a system call hook, but will not work on 64-bit Windows as this variable is not
exported in addition to the protection provided by Microsoft PatchGuard.

Windows API IoAllocateMdl(), and associating the MDL to a non-paged buffer using
MmBuildMdlForNonPagedPool(). Once the MDL is associated to the non-paged buffer, the sample locks the
underlying pages using the Windows API MmProbeAndLockPages(). Instead of hooking the entry in the
table directly, which is easily detectable, the driver uses the LDASM open-source disassembly engine to
analyze the function that is being pointed to by the table, and applying a Detours-style hook directly in the
code. It uses the standard ‚Äúmov cr0, eax‚Äù technique, turning off the Write Protect (WP) bit as it does this.
When the hook is installed, it writes a special DWORD value, ‚ÄòKDTR‚Äô, which allows it to prevent
double-hooking or badly-hooking the system call, during unhooking, this value is also checked.

In the registry hooking code of the driver, a call is made to ObReferenceObjectByHandle(). This allows the
driver to receive the ‚ÄòCM_KEY_OBJECT‚Äô which is then used with ObQueryNameString() to get the key/value

Attribution in the cyber domain is always a tricky subject when relying solely on malicious samples.
Compiler artifacts and language settings can of course be deliberately masked or spoofed. CrowdStrike

numerous indications that this is a Chinese-speaking actor.

attempting to prevent accidental infection on systems running this Anti-Virus product.
The obfuscation of the KdDisableDebugger() function call is seen on several Chinese language forums,
and can be seen being reused in several code samples on those forums. As previously mentioned there is
no advantage associated with using this call obfuscation, and appears to be reused for no apparent reason
other than the attackers have copied code directly from forum code.

CONCLUSION
The samples involved in this incident are typical of attacks commonly associated with the People‚Äôs
Republic of China (PRC). These code samples have a variety of Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
WKDWDUHXVHGWRWUDFNDQGLGHQWLI\VSHFL¬øFDGYHUVDU\JURXSV7KHVRSKLVWLFDWLRQRIWKHDFWRUUHVSRQVLEOHIRU

The ability to conduct Incident Response (IR) including forensics, and log analysis, greatly augments this
visibility into these aspects of the incident. Some indications as to the adversaries‚Äô capabilities can be
derived from the captured samples alone.

Dropper/Implant #1
The dropper code (MD5: 14c04f88dc97aef3e9b516ef208a2bf5) does not utilize any techniques that are
unique or unusual, and is consistent with tools, techniques, and procedures of attacks targeting proprietary
information and generally attributed to the PRC. The presence of dead code and its replacement by a more

side. The ‚Äòdead code‚Äô utilizes a more sophisticated compression algorithm provided by a third party which
was rendered useless for some reason. This may have been a result of the attacker modifying an existing
tool, or unknowingly using a re-purposed tool. The dropper resources indicate the compiler used to build the
tool was running on a system that utilized the Chinese ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù language pack and was built on Wednesday
May 4th, 2011 at 11:04:24 A.M. UTC (early evening time in China). While this can be deliberately spoofed

The dropped DLL (MD5: 47619fca20895abc83807321cbb80a3d) itself contains functionality that is typical

encryption/obfuscation using a statically compiled XOR key. The sample uses TCP port 443 for communication, but makes no attempt to mimic the SSL protocol typically used on that port number, which would
provide enhanced Operational Security (OPSEC). This code appears to have been compiled on Wednesday May 4th, 2011 at 10:48:19 A.M. UTC (early evening time in China).

Post Exploitation Tool
The post exploitation tool (MD5: 2dce7fc3f52a692d8a84a0c182519133) is a dual-use tool, it can be
dropped and executed by a client-side exploit, or the adversary can launch it using a variety of command
line options. This tool is built in Microsoft .NET framework, which is typically an indication of a less sophisticated attacker, because .NET is easier to develop in but requires the .NET framework be present on the
victim machine. The tool appears to have been compiled on Thursday May 26th, 2011 at 10:21:44 A.M.
UTC (early evening time in China). The sample utilizes the AES cryptographic algorithm to protect its C2
communications.

Implant #2
Backdoor DLL
This DLL is a moderately sophisticated backdoor with several well designed communication mechanisms
not typically seen in these types of implants. The code base for the sample was developed in C++. The
code appears to have been compiled on Sunday October 30, 2011 at 12:43:33 P.M. UTC (late evening time
in China). This sample has multiple communication capabilities available that makes it far more versatile
and stealthy. It implements relatively well thought out protocols including HTTP and DNS. The tool has the
ability to automatically down select the most effective communication channel once it has been instantiated,
which can help avoid detection from solutions like DNS blacklisting and RFC protocol enforcement. The
DLL itself contains traces of the original C++ class names that were utilized in the source code, which in

communicating to the C2, thus enhancing OPSEC. The sample contains ‚Äòdead code‚Äô which appears to be
command and control server classes, this is likely an indicator that the C2 client which would communicate
with this sample shares the same communications library which was compiled into this sample.
System Driver
The kernel driver component dropped by the Backdoor DLL bears many tool marks associating it with the
CCRootkit package publicly by Steven Lai (a/k/a embedlinux). This kernel mode rootkit implements several
hooking techniques that are aimed at preventing a system administrator from detecting the backdoor DLL.
The implementation of these techniques has some unique idiosyncrasies that permit direct attribution to the
source code Steven Lai posted. This driver attempts to hide a wide swath of TCP ports (40000-45000) for
an unknown reason, however it is suspected that this may relate to the potential network relaying capability
alluded to for the backdoor dll.

cardmagic writes: Windows Vista has changed alot on network module, many old
port hiding materials are no longer usable.
In this post, I will share with you a simple code to hide port under Vista,hope
it is useful for some guys .
Actually under Windows Vista, netstat.exe will call InternalGetTcpTable2 which
is exported by Iphlpapi.dll to list all open ports,then InternalGetTcpTable2
will transfer control to NsiAllocateAndGetTable which is exported by nsi.dll,

kernel mode module of NSI -- nsiproxy.sys. nsiproxy.sys is almost like a
wrapper of netio.sys, it will then call internal subroutines of netio.sys .
Here ,we will use a relatively easy way -- ‚ÄúNSI Kernel Module Dispatch Routine
