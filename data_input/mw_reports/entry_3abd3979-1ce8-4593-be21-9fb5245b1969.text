Tactic hides ransomware payload and lowers the risk of discovery
while encryption process is underway.
Symantec has found evidence that an increasing number of ransomware attackers are using
virtual machines (VMs) in order to run their ransomware payloads on compromised
computers. The motivation behind the tactic is stealth. In order to avoid raising suspicions or
triggering antivirus software, the ransomware payload will “hide” within a VM while encrypting
files on the host computer.
The tactic is a recent development, having been documented by Sophos in connection with
RagnarLocker last year. In that case, ransomware was run from inside an Oracle VirtualBox
Windows XP VM.

VirtualBox usage
During a recent investigation into an attempted ransomware attack, Symantec discovered
that the attackers had installed a VirtualBox VM on some compromised computers. Unlike
the previously documented RagnarLocker attacks, which involved Windows XP, the VM in
this case appeared to be running Windows 7.
The VM was delivered to the target via a malicious installer file that used various file names,
including:
fuckyou.msi
fuck.msi
aa51978f.msi
s3c.msi
The installer created a file called runner.exe, which was a Golang (Go) executable compiled
from the following source file:
C:/builder/runner/main.go
Apart from standard Go libraries, it used the go-ps library for process enumeration.
Embedded strings used by the executable, such as file names, process names, and
commands, were obfuscated using four-byte XOR keys. Each string was encrypted using a
unique key.

This executable depended on multiple other files that were expected to be present in the
same directory. Its main purpose was to install a VirtualBox VM in a headless mode.
When executed, runner.exe performed following actions:
It checked if it was running on Active Directory (AD) controller based on whether the
C:\Windows\SYSVOL directory was present. It exited if the check proved true.
It used a function named russianDetect to check if it was running on a system using a
Russian keyboard layout (0x0419). It exited if the check proved true. Checks such as
this are a common feature of targeted ransomware attacks.
It enumerated running processes and services and terminated any that were present
on blacklists (procBlacklist, servicesBlacklist) using taskkill.exe and sc.exe.
The executable then dropped, executed, and deleted a file called starter.bat with the
following content in order to mount a recovery partition:
mountvol E:\ \\?\Volume{<ID>}\
It then decrypted and dropped VirtualBox.xml, a VirtualBox configuration file, and micro.xml,
a VM configuration file (see appendix). It created an SDRSMLINK directory and linked
system files to that directory, e.g:
cmd /C mklink /j "%SYSTEMROOT%\SDRSMLINK\Program Files"
"%SYSTEMROOT%\Program Files"
It also adjusted the "<SharedFolders>" section in micro.xml to reflect files and directories
linked in CSIDL_WINDOWS\SDRSMLINK. It then initialized VirtualBox components:
It enumerated and cleared Windows system logs using WEvtUtil.exe:
Symantec did not obtain a VM image, but what likely occurred next was that the ransomware
payload was located on the VM's disk and auto started once the operating system was fully
booted. The VM likely had access to the host computer’s files and directories (via
"SharedFolders" set up by runner.exe), allowing it to encrypt files on the host computer.

Conti or Mount Locker?
While the payload running in the VM was not identified, there were reasonably strong
indicators that it was Conti. A username and password combination
(nuuser/[email protected]) used in these attacks was previously associated with older Conti
activity, dating from April 2021.

3/5

However, on the same computer that the VM was deployed on, Symantec also observed
Mount Locker being deployed, raising the question as to whether the payload was actually
Mount Locker. Since the main purpose of running a payload on a VM is to avoid detection, it
doesn’t make much sense for the attacker to also deploy the payload on the host computer.
One possible explanation is that the attacker is an affiliate operator with access to both Conti
and Mount Locker. They may have attempted to run a payload (either Conti or Mount Locker)
on a virtual machine and, when that didn’t work, opted to run Mount Locker on the host
computer instead.

Obfuscating malicious activity
Ransomware operators are continually refining their tactics in a bid to stay one step ahead of
detection. Many are now heavily relying on legitimate and dual-use tools in order to stage
attacks on targeted networks. The ransomware payload itself is often the stage of the attack
most likely to raise red flags and, by hiding it in a virtual machine, there is an expectation that
it may not be discovered. Organizations should exercise increased vigilance in relation to the
unauthorized installation of virtual machines on their networks.
