A Ukrainian security researcher has leaked over 60,000 internal messages belonging to the
Conti ransomware operation after the gang sided with Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.
BleepingComputer has independently confirmed the validity of these messages from
internal conversations previously shared with BleepingComputer regarding Conti's attack on
Shutterfly.
AdvIntel CEO Vitali Kremez, who has been tracking the Conti/TrickBot operation over the
last couple of years, also confirmed to BleepingComputer that the leaked messages are
valid and were taken from a log server for the Jabber communication system used by the
ransomware gang.

Kremez told BleepingComputer that the data was leaked by a researcher who had access
to the "ejabberd database" backend for Conti's XMPP chat server. This was also confirmed
by cybersecurity firm Hold Security.
In total, there are 393 leaked JSON files containing a total of 60,694 messages since
January 21, 2021, through today. Conti launched their operation in July 2020, so while it
contains a big chunk of their internal conversations, it is not all of them.

These conversations contain various information about the gang's activities, including
previously unreported victims, private data leak URLs, bitcoin addresses, and discussions
about their operations.
For example, the conversation below is the Conti members wondering how
BleepingComputer learned of their attack on Shutterfly in December.

Kremez also shared a snippet of conversation that he found discussing how the TrickBot
operation was shut down, as we reported last week.

There are also conversations about Conti/TrickBot's Diavol ransomware operation and 239
bitcoin addresses containing $13 million in payments, which were added to the
Ransomwhere site.

have been added to https://t.co/lBxHWCQm7S. The full dataset is available to

The leak of these messages is a severe blow to the ransomware operation, providing
sensitive intelligence to researchers and law enforcement about their internal processes.
While the above snippets are only a tiny piece of the leaked conversations, we can expect
to see far more information learned from the data in the coming weeks.

Messages leaked over Conti's siding with Russia
Earlier this week, the Conti ransomware operation published a blog post announcing their
full support for the Russian government's attack on Ukraine. They also warned that if
anyone organized a cyberattack against Russia, the Conti gang would strike back at critical
infrastructure.

After Ukrainian Conti affiliates grew upset over the siding with Russia, the Conti gang
replaced their message with another one, stating that they "do not ally with any
government" and that they "condemn the ongoing war."

However, their change of heart came too late, and a Ukrainian security researcher who
reportedly had access to Conti's backend XMPP server emailed BleepingComputer and
other journalists tonight with a link to the leaked data.
The reason shared as to why they leaked the private conversations can be read below:
Here is a friendly heads-up that the Conti gang has just lost all their sh*t. Please
know this is true.
The link will take you to download an 1.tgz file that can be unpacked running tar -xzvf
1.tgz command in your terminal .
The contents of the first dump contain the chat communications (current, as of today
and going to the past) of the Conti Ransomware gang. We promise it is very
interesting.
There are more dumps coming , stay tuned.
You can help the world by writing this as your top story.
It is not malware or a joke.
This is being sent to many journalists and researchers.
Thank you for your support
Glory to Ukraine!
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to hackers, ransomware gangs, and security
researchers picking sides in the conflict.
While some ransomware gangs have sided with Russia, others, like LockBit, are staying
neutral.

On the other hand, Ukraine has asked volunteer researchers and hackers to join their "IT
Army" to conduct cyberattacks on Russian targets, with many rallying to the call.
As for Conti, while this leak is embarrassing and provides immense insight into their
operation, we are not likely to see them going away any time soon. With their recent take
over of the stealthy BazarBackdoor malware and becoming an actual crime syndicate, they
will, unfortunately, continue to be a threat.
Correction 2/28/22: This story initially stated an angry Conti affiliate who leaked the data.
BleepingComputer later learned it was leaked by a Ukrainian security researcher. The
article has been updated to clarify this information.
