ThreatConnect identifies Chinese targeting of two
companies. Economic espionage or military
intelligence?
It was the best of times; it was the worst of times. While Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) activity against the US and other
international organizations [https://www.threatconnect.com/guccifer-2-0-dnc-hack-fancy-bears/?
utm_campaign=DNC%20Guccifer%202.0%20Fancy%20Bears%20Research&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter] has
dominated the headlines recently, Chinese APT actors have been active outside the limelight. In June 2016, Chinese APT actors
were discovered using a customized implant within the network of a European consumer electronics company that specializes in
drone technologies and a U.S. subsidiary of a French energy management company that builds infrastructure for the U.S.
government and the Department of Defense. Chinese e orts against the European consumer drone company appear to be
economically motivated and represent a deviation from the September 2015 agreement
[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-china-vow-not-to-engage-in-economic-cyberespionage/2015/09/25/90e74b6a63b9-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html] between the U.S. and China to disavow economic espionage. Due to their involvement
with the U.S. military, it could be argued targeting the energy management company was for military intelligence and not
economic espionage.
Using the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, [https://threatconnect.com/blog/diamond-model-threat-intelligence-star-wars/]
we will start by walking through the technical axis of the attack where we found malware used by multiple Chinese APTs calling
back to a domain with the same registrant as those used in the 2015 Anthem and OPM breaches. We’ll pivot to the socio-political
axis of the attack, and discuss how the victims t the targeting pro le of at least one Chinese APT – although we are unable to
attribute the attack to a speci c Chinese APT at this time.

ThreatConnect discovers Chinese APT activity in two European companies

Capabilities: HttpBrowser Backdoor
On June 08, 2016 ThreatConnect identi ed a malicious executable MD5: 3BEA073FA50B62C561CEDD9619CD8425. This malware is
a variant of “HttpBrowser,” a backdoor used by multiple Chinese APTs, including EMISSARY PANDA (aka APT27/TG-3390
[https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage] ) and DYNAMITE PANDA
[http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/unit42-new-wekby-attacks-use-dns-requests-as-command-and-controlmechanism/] (aka APT18/Wekby/TG-0416). Some reports refer to
[https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf] HttpBrowser as the GTalk trojan or “Token
Control.” According to TrendMicro [https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf] ,
HttpBrowser allows a threat actor to spawn a reverse shell, upload or download les, and capture keystrokes on a compromised
system, similar to other remote administration tools (RATs). Antivirus detection for HttpBrowser is extremely low and typically
based upon heuristic signatures. The report also indicates HttpBrowser is not available on underground markets.
Several variants of the HttpBrowser backdoor exist; however, in this particular sample beaconing network tra c stands out as the
telltale “HttpBrowser/1.0” User-Agent string is replaced with “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2) Gecko/%lu Firefox/3.0.1”,
where %lu is a format modi er that appends an unsigned long numerical data type to the user-agent string.

ThreatConnect discovers Chinese APT activity in two European companies

The malware sends system information using the query string “computer=<COMPUTER NAME>&lanip=<LAN IP>&uid=<Unique
ID>&os=<OS VERSION>&relay=<RELAY NUMBER>&data=<DATA>”

Infrastructure: Adobesys[.]com and a familiar registrant

Leveraging ThreatConnect’s WHOIS function, we identi ed the malware’s hardcoded command and control domain
adobesys[.]com was registered by the Chinese domain reseller and mass registrant, li2384826402[@]yahoo[.]com. This email
address is infamous for registering domains used in the DEEP PANDA-attributed Anthem [https://www.threatconnect.com/theanthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/] and OPM [https://www.threatconnect.com/opm-breach-analysis-update/] attacks in 2015,
and provides additional evidence tying this HttpBrowser activity to Chinese APT actors.
Using ThreatConnect’s Farsight Passive DNS integration, we can identify the adobesys[.]com domain was hosted at two IP
addresses — 173.231.11[.]24 and 185.92.222[.]81 — while the domain most likely was operational. One other domain,
newsoft2[.]com, was hosted at the 185.92.222[.]81 IP during the same timeframe as adobesys[.]com. WHOIS information indicates
that newsoft2[.]com was also registered by a Chinese registrant (omyname@gmail[.]com), and its co-location with the malicious
adobesys[.]com domain suggests that it may be operated by the same actors behind the HttpBrowser activity. Indicators from this
activity have been shared in incident 20151228A: Chinese HttpBrowser Activity Targeting European Companies
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=1080388] .

Victims: Two Targets
We provided a lead on the malware and adobesys[.]com to a partner, who collected associated network tra c and worked with us
to analyze the activity. In this case, the activity was targeted against only a few companies. We determined the Chinese actors
used the “HttpBrowser” backdoor variant to target a control systems engineer in product development at a European consumer
drone company. The tra c also helped us identify another target: the U.S. subsidiary of a French energy management company
that has contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government elements to implement energy management
and SCADA solutions.
Both organizations were alerted to this activity shortly after it was discovered. At this time, we have no indication what, if any,
data was stolen from them.

Adversary: Pondering the PANDAs
While we cannot state for certain which Chinese APT is behind this activity,
[https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf] targeting a consumer drone company and
energy management company is most consistent with previous EMISSARY PANDA targeting. Both EMISSARY and DYNAMITE
PANDA have previously targeted the defense and aerospace industries, among others; however, EMISSARY PANDA is the only one
of the two known to have targeted energy companies.
[https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf] According to the Secureworks report
[https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage] , EMISSARY PANDA
commonly conducts strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as watering hole attacks, on websites associated with the
target organization’s industry to increase the likelihood of compromising victims with relevant information. EMISSARY PANDA also
uses spearphishing emails to target speci c victims. At this time we do not know whether SWCs or spearphishing emails were
used to target the victim organizations.

Socio-Political: Discussing Possible Motivations
The HttpBrowser sample piqued our interest since the information security community has had a heightened focus on whether or
not Beijing is abiding by the September 2015 agreement [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-china-vow-not-to-engagein-economic-cyberespionage/2015/09/25/90e74b6a-63b9-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html] between U.S. and China to
disavow economic espionage. The U.S. subsidiary of the French energy management company looks like an artful dodge. These
dual use organizations – those that possess signi cant intellectual property and are also involved with the U.S. government –
present tempting targets for China that could facilitate a variety of espionage e orts. However, China could claim such activity
constitutes military espionage and therefore does not violate the agreement between Presidents Obama and Xi from last
September.
By contrast, targeting the European civilian drone maker looks like a case of economically motivated espionage. The world’s
largest and most popular drone manufacturer is China’s DaJiang Innovation Technology (DJI), which currently holds about 70% of
the commercial drone market share [http://www.popularmechanics.com/ ight/drones/a18486/6-reasons-dji-is-winning-the-dronewars/] and was valued at over $10 billion in May 2015 [http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/29/drones-in-2016-4numbers-everyone-should-know.aspx] . The emerging global market for business services using commercial drones was recently
valued at over $127 billion [http://press.pwc.com/News-releases/global-market-for-commercial-applications-of-drone-technologyvalued-at-over--127-bn/s/AC04349E-C40D-4767-9F92-A4D219860CD2] due to the growing applicability of drones across industries
including agriculture, mapping, and surveillance.
In this instance, China most likely is seeking to quash any competition posed to DJI’s command of the market. Within the
command and control tra c we were able to identify that a control systems engineer — with probable access to the European
rm’s proprietary drone intellectual property and technical data — was targeted as a part of this activity, which likely further
demonstrates the motivation behind the operation. With access to the targeted company’s intellectual property, sensitive
communications, and product roadmap, China could provide its favored companies with economic advantages such as:

 Integrating competitors’ unique or proprietary capabilities: Many commercial drones rely on custom software for capabilities
such as stabilization, tracking, and GPS. Stealing and integrating competitors’ technologies would lessen any advantage that
competitors would have over Chinese drones.

 Preempting competitors’ innovations: Leveraging compromised intellectual property on drone innovations could allow
Chinese companies to advance their own product lines beyond what competitors plan to introduce in future products.

 Preempting nancial or pricing moves from competitors: In an industry where price wars and gouging can have a signi cant
impact on the competition, having the inside scoop on how your competitors plan to price their drones can provide an upper
hand in attempting to undercut them and steal market share.

 Understanding competitors’ business and development plans or bid e orts: Insider information on how competitors plan to
expand their business, augment manufacturing, market their product, or bid contracts, can all help Chinese drone companies
gain an advantage over their competitors.

Economic Espionage Evolution?
While Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage may be less pronounced, it almost certainly hasn’t ended and likely has evolved
to help solidify leading market shares. In some ways, solidifying the dominant Chinese rm in a market feels like the next chapter
in economic espionage. The overarching storyline of China’s economic espionage has been targeting strategic industries and
allowing China to catch up with established champions. Chinese APT e orts against American Steel manufacturers
[https://www.fbi.gov/pittsburgh/press-releases/2014/u.s.-charges- ve-chinese-military-hackers-with-cyber-espionage-against-u.s.corporations-and-a-labor-organization-for-commercial-advantage] likely facilitated the rise in Chinese world steel production from
about 15% in 2000 to 50% in 2015 [http://qz.com/699979/how-chinas-overproduction-of-steel-is-damaging-companies-andcountries-around-the-world/] .
China may be attempting to avoid the ire of the U.S. government as it targets organizations that are headquartered elsewhere.
Furthermore, China may also be attempting to be more e cient as it focuses collection on organizations that meet multiple
intelligence requirements. Targeting such organizations could allow China to explain away their activity as non-economic
espionage, thereby adhering (with their ngers crossed) to the Rose Garden agreement.
