Threat Activity Group RedFoxtrot
Linked to China’s PLA Unit 69010;
Targets Bordering Asian Countries

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

This report profiles a suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat
activity group, RedFoxtrot, with links to PLA Unit 69010. The activity was
identified through a combination of large-scale automated network traffic
analytics and expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded Future
Platform, SecurityTrails, DomainTools, PolySwarm, Farsight, and common
open-source tools and techniques. The report will be of most interest
to individuals engaged in strategic and operational intelligence relating
to the activities of Chinese military intelligence units in cyberspace and
network defenders with a presence in Central or South Asia. Analysis
cut-off date: June 1, 2021.

Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has identified
ties between a suspected Chinese state-sponsored
threat activity group we track as RedFoxtrot and the
Chinese military intelligence apparatus, specifically
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010 located in
Ürümqi, Xinjiang. This activity offers a glimpse into PLA
operations following a major organizational restructure
beginning in 2015 and follows a period where public
reporting has largely concentrated on groups affiliated
with China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS).
Unit 69010 is likely the Military Unit Cover Designator
(MUCD) for a Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB)
within the PLA Strategic Support Force (SSF) Network
Systems Department (NSD), an information and cyber
warfare branch of the PLA. Due to lax operational
security measures employed by a suspected RedFoxtrot
operator, Insikt Group linked the threat group to the
physical address of Unit 69010’s headquarters. Publicly
available procurement and court documents further tied
Unit 69010 both to this address and to the SSF. Multiple
academic publications also support the hypothesis that
this unit has a cyber mission.
RedFoxtrot has been active since at least 2014
and predominantly targets government, defense, and
telecommunications sectors across Central Asia, India,
and Pakistan, aligning with the likely operational remit of
Unit 69010. Of particular note, within the past 6 months,
Insikt Group detected RedFoxtrot network intrusions
targeting 3 Indian aerospace and defense contractors;
major telecommunications providers in Afghanistan,

India, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan; and multiple government
agencies across the region. RedFoxtrot maintains large
amounts of operational infrastructure and has likely
employed both bespoke and publicly available malware
families commonly used by Chinese cyber espionage
groups, including Icefog, PlugX, Royal Road, Poison Ivy,
ShadowPad, and PCShare. RedFoxtrot activity overlaps
with threat groups tracked by other security vendors as
Temp.Trident and Nomad Panda.

Key Judgments
• Formerly known as the Lanzhou Military Region‘s
Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau, PLA
Unit 69010 has very likely been incorporated into
the Network Systems Department of the PLASSF following a 2015 restructure.
• We believe that RedFoxtrot is a Chinese statesponsored threat activity group based on
identified links to a specific PLA unit and the use
of shared custom capabilities considered unique
to Chinese cyber espionage groups.
• In 2020, RedFoxtrot, alongside multiple other PLA
and MSS-affiliated threat groups, likely gained
access to the ShadowPad backdoor.
• In the aftermath of the 2015 restructuring,
activity linked to previously tracked PLAaffiliated cyber espionage groups has declined,
likely due to old activity groups disbanding or
merging to form new clusters. With continued
activity from suspected PLA groups such as
Tonto Team, Tick, Naikon, and RedFoxtrot, and
the emergence of new Chinese threat activity
groups with suspected PLA links, Insikt Group
believes that PLA-affiliated groups remain
prominent within the Chinese cyber espionage
sphere despite increased attention on their MSS
counterparts.

What is Unit 69010?
Unit 69010 is likely the MUCD for a bureau within the PLASSF headquartered in Ürümqi, Xinjiang. Formerly known as the
Lanzhou Military Region‘s Second TRB according to research
published in 2011 from the Project 2049 Institute, signals
intelligence (SIGINT) has long been considered to be within Unit
69010’s area of responsibility. The unit also likely has multiple
subordinate offices primarily responsible for monitoring military
activity along China’s western border. An analysis of academic
output attributed to the unit also provides evidence that Unit
69010 likely has a cyber mission as late as 2015 (example
publications 2,3). Prior to a restructure beginning in 2015, much

following PLA reforms.
The former Lanzhou Military Region was incorporated within
the new Western Theater Command of the PLA following the
2015 restructure. The Western Theater Command is one of 5
theater commands of the PLA, and is almost certainly tasked
with monitoring India, Pakistan, and Central Asia. This orientation
directly aligns with observed RedFoxtrot activity. Similarly,
intelligence gathering on defense, military, telecommunications,
and government targets also aligns with the expected operational
scope of a PLA unit and fits the target profile of other PLA-linked
groups (1,2,3).

Baidu Maps shows that this address corresponds to a large
compound facility comprising multiple buildings and a residential
area. As evident from satellite and street-level imagery, multiple
satellites are visible on the roof of the unit’s main building as well
as the hill behind the compound, while other attributes commonly
seen at PLA bases are also present, such as a parade area, a
running track and sports fields, and a large gated entrance.

Two other properties share the same address as Unit 69010: an apartment
complex across the street, which we were unable to confirm is affiliated with the
base, and an electronics store directly beside the base. It is very unlikely that the
RedFoxtrot persona and related cyber espionage activity is linked to either of
these 2 properties and the address almost certainly refers to Unit 69010 in the
context of our investigation.

Mapping RedFoxtrot’s Sprawling Infrastructure
Using Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA),
adversary infrastructure detection, and other common analytical
techniques, we have tracked a large cluster of RedFoxtrot
infrastructure and associated malware samples used in active
intrusions over the past 6 months. There are strong ties between
this activity and publicly reported campaigns dating back to at
least 2014. We identified clear and consistent hosting overlaps
for domains linked to the identified infrastructure cluster, as well
as common targeting and overlapping malware use. Notably,
we identified the following high-level trends in the group’s
infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs):
• Use of a large number of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains
which form part of overlapping infrastructure clusters

As previously referenced in our reporting on the China-linked
group RedEcho, network infrastructure used in ShadowPad
infections is tracked by Insikt Group as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE.

AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE and PlugX Clusters
Using Recorded Future adversary infrastructure detection
methods, we identified that a large proportion of the RedFoxtrot
domains are linked to AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE and PlugX C2
infrastructure. Many of these were also used as C2s for different
malware families, such as PCShare. Commonly, the group used
single servers to host a swath of DDNS domains, which were
moved around in bulk over time.

• DDNS domains often contain hints regarding
geographical targeting or spoof specific organizations
(for example, “inbsnl.ddns[.]info”, “adtl.mywire[.]org”, and
“indianmail.zyns[.]com”)
• Strong preference for DigitalOcean and Choopa (Vultr)
hosting providers in recent times
• Use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure, indicative
of the group’s likely access to the ShadowPad backdoor

multiple additional RedFoxtrot domains. Notably, the Poison Ivy

QUICKHEAL
We also identified multiple samples related to the identified
adversary infrastructure cluster that appear to overlap with the
malware variant tracked by FireEye as QUICKHEAL. All samples
share an unusual export “GetOfficeDatatal” and feature multiple
overlaps with 2 QUICKHEAL samples reported by FireEye in
relation to the WATERFIGHT and SKYLINE campaigns.
One of the notable code overlaps is a function that loads
memory addresses for SQLite and NSS functions, which are then
used to parse, decode, and decrypt username and password
combinations from the victim’s Mozilla profiles. QUICKHEAL has
also continued to use code to check if the backdoor is running
in a proxy, and shares a hardcoded User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
(compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR
2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.210.

• Another RedFoxtrot domain, water.xxuz[.]com, is
linked to a historical Icefog sample (ICEFOG-P version)
(SHA256: 0c596299c47ce6305e07f5
5397fd69d49c8cab4f4b34a617bb6670dcaac9d9f2). This
sample was likely used in the WATERFIGHT campaign.
• Notably, 2 Royal Road lures used by the group in 2018
and 2019 specifically reference 2 telecommunications
providers in Pakistan and India. We subsequently
identified 2021 intrusions targeting both of these
organizations. While we cannot confirm whether
these previous intrusion attempts using Royal Road
were successful, it indicates that telecommunications
providers are a long term target of the group.

Royal Road, IceFog, and Poison Ivy
Elements of RedFoxtrot’s use of the Royal Road RTF
weaponizer to load the IceFog and Poison Ivy backdoors
throughout 2018 and 2019 have been previously documented;
however, we have not observed the group load other malware
families using Royal Road other than these 2. While wider use of
the Royal Road weaponizer by some Chinese groups is ongoing,
its use by RedFoxtrot and several other China-linked groups has
dropped since early 2020, likely in response to extensive public
reporting. In addition to public reporting detailing the group’s use
of these capabilities, further examples of RedFoxtrot’s historical
use of these tools to target Central Asia, Pakistan, and India
include the following:
• A RedFoxtrot Royal Road sample
(51e3f3a762ab6fb0c3db4819560c6b160
7cdcd257ce375e68fdf1a17ff5c2cb5) from 2019 is
linked to the identified infrastructure cluster, with the
C2 domain remaining active into late 2020. The RTF
document title is “DYSL-QT_Slide_DMC_090719.doc”,
which likely corresponds to the “Defence Research
and Development Organisation (DRDO) Young Scientist
Laboratory for Quantum Technologies” (DYSL-QT)
located in Hyderabad, India. Additionally, DMC is likely
in reference to the DRDO Management Council (DMC),
suggesting the group used this lure in activity targeting
Indian defense research. The RTF document drops the
same Poison Ivy SKYLINE variant payload referenced
earlier in the report (367718fd58c658dce22c995f3e10
bc3a5425814ddf221686e166e3129a53e
897), which is configured to communicate with the C2

Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy

Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks
threat actors and their activity, focusing on state actors
from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cyber
criminals - individuals and groups - from Russia, CIS states,
China, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity
groups and where possible, attributing them to nation state
government, organizations, or affiliate institutions.

ADVERSARY

Our coverage includes:
•

Government organizations and intelligence
agencies, their associated laboratories, partners,
industry collaborators, proxy entities, and
individual threat actors.

•

Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation
state activity groups, such as RedAlpha,
RedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many
other industry established groups.

•

Cybercriminal individuals and groups established
and named by Recorded Future

•

Newly emerging malware, as well as
prolific,persistent commodity malware

INFRASTRUCTURE

CAPABILITY

VICTIM

Insikt Group names a new threat activity group or
campaign when analysts have data corresponding to at
least three points on the Diamond Model of Intrusion
Analysis with at least medium confidence, derived from our
Security Intelligence Graph. We can tie this to a threat actor
only when we can point to a handle, persona, person, or
organization responsible. We will write about the activity as
a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data.
We use the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a
particular group when the public body of empirical evidence
is clear the activity corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet
naming convention for new nation state threat actor groups
or campaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag
colors, currently represented below, with more color/nation
pairings to be added as we identify and attribute new threat
actor groups associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt
Group uses a naming convention corresponding to the
Greek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity
connected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate
country color, and where that group may be tied to a specific
government organization, tie it to that entity specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming
newly identified malware.
