At the beginning of January 2013, we started tracking the interesting Win32/Redyms trojan

infected machines. This Trojan family is mostly spreading in the United States and Canada.

It is in these regions that the cybercrime market pays the highest prices for redirection from
popular search engines results to malicious ads/links. I’ve already published information
about PPI (Pay-Per-Install) programs which distribute malware for BlackHat SEO (Cycbot:
Ready to Ride).
Deeper analysis shows that Win32/Redyms has similar code functions and work activity to
Win32/Agent.TJO (also known as part of the Olmarik/TDL4 family). Win32/Agent.TJO is a
user-mode Trojan program, but based on clicker component functionality found in the TDL4
family (The Evolution of TDL: Conquering x64). TDL4, Win32/Agent.TJO and
Win32/Redyms use similar techniques for network traffic manipulation in the active internet
browser. So as to intercept and alter the data exchanged over the network the bot hooks
several functions from Microsoft Windows Socket Provider (mswsock.dll):

All three malware families use the same hooking technique and a communication protocol
encrypted by RC4 stream cipher. The communication routine call graph in Win32/Redyms
looks like this:

The next interesting finding in Win32/Redyms is the DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm)
used to generate C&C domain names. This DGA is based on simple alphabetical
permutations and changes according to the init state constant. Reconstructed algorithms in
python and decompiled assembly code are shown in the following figures:

The list of C&C domain names generated looks like this:

The first domain names from the list were registered in the middle of December 2012 or at
the beginning of January 2013. This indicates indirectly that Win32/Redyms was being
distributed at the end of December.
Win32/Redyms injects malicious code into all active processes on the infected machine. If
activity from the most popular browsers was detected, a malicious thread was injected into
the browser process and functions from mswsock.dll were hooked.

The injected code intercepts network activity from the browser process and looks up search
engines from the following list:

If search engine activity is detected, all search requests are redirected to the C&C and the
URLs shown in the search results will be changed in accordance with the list received from
the C&C. The URL checking engine is based on hooking the WSPSend() routine, which
uses Adelson-Velsky/Landis (AVL) trees as data structure in order to manage the data. For
operating with the AVL trees data structure the malware utilizes the structure
RTL_GENERIC_TABLE from kernel32.dll. TDL4 uses the same ideas in the user-mode
component cmd.dll.
