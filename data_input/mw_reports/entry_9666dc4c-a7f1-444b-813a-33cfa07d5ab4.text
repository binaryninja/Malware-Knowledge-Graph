McAfee Enterprise and FireEye recently released its 2022 Threat Predictions. In this blog,
we take a deeper dive into a Game of Thrones power struggle among Ransomware-as-aService bad actors in 2022.

Prediction: Self-reliant cybercrime groups will shift the balance of
power within the RaaS eco-kingdom.
For several years, ransomware attacks have dominated the headlines as arguably the most
impactful cyber threats. The Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model at the time opened
the cybercrime career path to lesser skilled criminals which eventually led to more breaches
and higher criminal profits.
For a long time, RaaS admins and developers were prioritized as the top targets, often
neglecting the affiliates since they were perceived as less skilled. This, combined with the
lack of disruptions in the RaaS ecosystem, created an atmosphere where those lesserskilled affiliates could thrive and grow into very competent cybercriminals, eventually with a
mind of their own.
In a response to the Colonial Pipeline attack, the popular cybercrime forums have banned
ransomware actors from advertising. Now, the RaaS groups no longer have a thirdparty platform on which to actively recruit, show their seniority, offer escrow, have their
binaries tested by moderators, or settle disputes. The lack of visibility has made it harder for
RaaS groups to establish or maintain credibility and will make it harder for RaaS developers
to maintain their current top tier position in the underground.

These events have undermined their trusted position. Ransomware has generated billions
of dollars in recent years and it’s only a matter of time before more individuals who believe
they aren’t getting their fair share become unhappy.
The first signs of this happening are already visible as described in our blog on the Groove
Gang, a cyber-criminal gang that branched off from classic RaaS to specialize in computer
network exploitation (CNE), exfiltrate sensitive data and, if lucrative, partner with a
ransomware team to encrypt the organization’s network. McAfee Enterprise ATR believes,
with high confidence, that the Groove gang is associated with the Babuk gang, either as a
former affiliate or subgroup. These cybercriminals are happy to put aside previous
Ransomware-as-a-Service hierarchies to focus on the ill-gotten gains to be made from
controlling victim’s networks, rather than the previous approach which prioritized control of
the ransomware itself.
Trust in a few things remains important even among cybercriminals underground, such as
keeping your word and paying people what they deserve. Cybercriminals aren’t immune
from feeling like employees whose contributions aren’t being adequately rewarded. When
this happens, these bad actors cause problems within the organization. Ransomware has
been generating billions of dollars in recent years and with revenue like that, it was
inevitable that some individuals who believe they aren’t getting their fair share become
unhappy and let the cybercrime world know it.
Recently, a former Conti affiliate was unhappy with their financial portion and decided to
disclose the complete Conti attack playbook and their Cobalt Strike infrastructure online. In
the past, McAfee ATR has been approached by individuals affiliated with certain RaaS
groups expressing grudges with other RaaS members and admins, claiming they haven’t
been paid in time or that their share wasn’t proportionate to the amount of work they put in.
In 2022, expect more self-reliant cybercrime groups to rise and shift the balance of power
within the RaaS eco-climate from those who control the ransomware to those who control
the victim’s networks.

Less-skilled Operators Won’t Have to Bend the Knee in RaaS Model
Power Shift
The Ransomware-as-a-Service eco system has evolved with the use of affiliates, the
middlemen and women that work with the developers for a share of the profits. While this
structure was honed during the growth of GandCrab, we are witnessing potential chasms in
what is becoming a not-so-perfect union.
Historically, the ransomware developers, held the cards, thanks to their ability to selectively
determine the affiliates in their operations, even holding “job interviews” to establish
technical expertise. Using CTB locker as an example, prominence was placed on affiliates
generating sufficient installs via a botnet, exploit kits or stolen credentials. But affiliates

recently taking on the role and displaying the ability to penetrate and compromise a
complete network using a variety of malicious and non-malicious tools essentially changed
the typical affiliate profile towards a highly skilled pen-tester/sysadmin.
The hierarchy of a conventional organized crime group often is described as a pyramid
structure. Historically, La Cosa Nostra, drug cartels and outlaw motor gangs were organized
in such a fashion. However, due to further professionalization and specialization of the
logistics involved with committing crime, groups have evolved into more opportunistic
network-based groups that will work together more fluidly, according to their current needs.
While criminals collaborating in the world of cybercrime isn’t new, a RaaS group’s hierarchy
has been more rigid compared to other forms of cybercrime, due to the power imbalance
between the group’s developers/admins and affiliates. But things are changing. RaaS
admins and developers were prioritized as the top targets, but often neglected the affiliates
who they perceived to be less-skilled. This, combined with the lack of disruptions in the
RaaS ecosystem, created an atmosphere where those lesser-skilled affiliates could thrive
and grow into very competent cybercriminals.
As more ransomware players have entered the market, we suspect that the most talented
affiliates are now able to auction their services for a bigger part of the profits, and maybe
demand a broader say in operations. For example, the introduction of Active Directory
enumeration within DarkSide ransomware could be intended to remove the dependency on
the technical expertise of affiliates. These shifts signal a potential migration back to the
early days of ransomware, with less-skilled operators increasing in demand using the
expertise encoded by the ransomware developers.
Will this work? Frankly, it will be challenging to replicate the technical expertise of a skilled
penetration tester, and maybe – just maybe – the impact will not be as severe as recent
cases.
