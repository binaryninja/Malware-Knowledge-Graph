Ransomware
Hive
Hive ransomware follows the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model in which developers
create, maintain, and update the malware, and affiliates conduct the ransomware attacks. From
June 2021 through at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target
a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities,
Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare
and Public Health (HPH).
As of November 2022, Hive ransomware actors have victimized over 1,300 companies
worldwide, receiving approximately US$100 million in ransom payments, according to FBI
information .
