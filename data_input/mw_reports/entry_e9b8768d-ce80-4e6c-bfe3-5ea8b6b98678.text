A ransomware attack that hobbled a Georgia county government in early October reportedly
disabled a database used to verify voter signatures in the authentication of absentee ballots.
It is the first reported case of a ransomware attack affecting an election-related system in the
2020 cycle. Federal officials and cybersecurity experts are especially concerned that
ransomware attacks — even ones that don’t intentionally target election infrastructure —
could disrupt voting and damage confidence in the integrity of the Nov. 3 election.
The Oct. 7 attack on Hall County, in the northern part of the state, hit critical systems and
interrupted phone services, the county said in a statement posted on its website. County
spokeswoman Katie Crumley did not return multiple requests for comment from The
Associated Press.

But according to a report in the Gainesville Times, the attack also disabled the county’s voter
signature database. Crumley was also quoted in an online CNN story saying that the attack
affected both the signature database and a voting precinct map.
Ransomware scrambles affected computer networks with encryption that can only be
unlocked with keys provided once the victim has paid up. Deloitte analyst Srini Subramanian
said ransoms local governments pay in such cases average about $400,000.
An update Thursday evening on the county website said “the voting process for citizens has
not been impacted by the attack.” However, a county official quoted by the Times said
signature verification was slowed because employees had to manually pull hard copies of
voter registration cards in many cases. The official was quoted as saying that most voter
signatures could still be verified using a state database unaffected by the attack. The county
has 129,000 registered voters.
In most states, signatures are used to validate absentee ballots sent by mail. Written on the
envelopes that sheath the ballots, they are matched by election workers against signatures
on file with state and local election authorities.
Federal officials recently announced that Russian hackers have infiltrated dozens of state
and local government networks and could be poised to launch disruptive attacks.
An international ransomware syndicate known as Doppelpaymer appears to be involved in
the Hall County attack. It posted documents purportedly stolen from Hall County on a dark
web site as proof of responsibility.
Crumley, the county spokeswoman, did not respond to an email asking how much ransom
that attackers had demanded and whether the county had paid a ransom.
Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emsisoft cybersecurity firm, said the attack could augur other
similar actions exploiting the proximity of Election Day.
“The real question is how many local government networks are already compromised?
Threat actors frequently delay deploying ransomware on compromised networks until what
they consider to be the most opportune moment — and that may well be in the days
immediately prior to the election,” he said. “What better time to extort money from a
government by holding its systems hostage than when those systems are most needed?”
A worsening ransomware plague is afflicting U.S. cities, counties and school districts,
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
At least 82 government bodies in the U.S. have been hit by ransomware so far this year.
Eighteen of those incidents have occurred since the beginning of September, according to
Emsisoft.
