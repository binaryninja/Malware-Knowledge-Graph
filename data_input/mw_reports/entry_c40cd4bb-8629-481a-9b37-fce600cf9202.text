ministries of foreign affairs

Report
Diplomatic missions, including ministries of foreign affairs (MFA), are high-priority targets for
today’s cyber spies. Large-scale cyber espionage campaigns such as “GhostNet” have
demonstrated that government agencies around the world, including embassies, are
vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks.
As the crisis in Syria escalated in 2013, FireEye researchers discovered a cyber espionage
campaign, which we called “Ke3chang,” that falsely advertised information updates about the
ongoing crisis to compromise MFA networks in Europe.
We believe that the Ke3chang attackers operated out of China and had been active since at
least 2010. However, we believe specific Syria-themed attacks against MFAs (codenamed by
Ke3chang as “moviestar”) began only in August 2013. The timing of the attacks precedes a
G20 meeting held in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria.

and compromised by a threat actor FireEye has dubbed “Ke3chang”.
