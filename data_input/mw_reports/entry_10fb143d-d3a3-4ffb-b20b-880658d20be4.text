Unit 42 has been tracking malicious spam (malspam) pushing Hancitor malware during the
past 2 years. Hancitor, also known as Chanitor or Tordal, is a macro-based malware spread
through Microsoft Office documents distributed in malspam campaigns. Hancitor is designed
to infect a victim's Microsoft Windows computer with additional malware, and the end result
is most often a banking Trojan. But the impact of Hancitor malspam is fairly limited. On a
default-configured Windows 10 host, the malware is easily detected by Microsoft's built-in
Windows Defender anti-virus tool. Furthermore, many spam filters catch these emails before
they get to their intended recipients.
Who is Hancitor effective against? An ideal target victim be someone running an outdated
version of Windows like Windows 7 with anti-virus disabled. Such victims would also click
through any warnings they encounter. Apparently, this target demographic is substantial
enough that criminals behind Hancitor malspam continue to push their emails on a frequent
1/10

basis.
While researchers have published many technical reports on Hancitor campaigns, their
primary focus has been on the malware and its capabilities. But how does this type of attack
with a limited base of victims remain profitable? Little has been published about how this
campaign uses fraud accounts and the compromised infrastructure of legitimate businesses.
Understanding the playbook used by these criminals is essential to understand why they
continue to operate.
We continue to see several hundred examples of Hancitor malspam every month sent to a
wide variety of recipients. The image below shows data extracted from our Autofocus threat
intelligence platform. It provides high-level visibility on how frequently we've seen Hancitor
malspam so far in 2017.

Figure 1: Timeline of Hancitor campaign activity since January 2017.

According to our Autofocus data, we can infer criminals behind this campaign follow a 5-day
work week from Monday through Friday. Spikes in the email activity often occur in the middle
of the week. This reflects a general pattern of productivity seen with most people who follow
the same type of schedule.
Campaign History
In previous years, Hancitor malware was delivered as email attachments in malspam
campaigns. Microsoft Word documents from this malspam downloaded other malware like
Pony, Vawtrak, and DELoader as depicted in Figure 2.

Hancitor Campaign Updates its Playbook
In the past, criminals have successfully infected victims using email attachments, but email
filtering has improved in recent years. Most current enterprise-level security solutions now
include a sharp focus on email attachments and can easily detect malicious documents and
ultimately impact the success rate of the attackers' campaigns.
To further evade detection, since the end of 2016, actors behind Hancitor have added
another step in the infection process. Instead of email attachments, a link in the email points
to distribution servers hosting these Hancitor-base documents. Figure 3 outlines current
campaign methods used to deliver Hancitor. This campaign continues to use distribution
servers, indicating this technique has proven successful.

Figure 3: Current depiction of Hancitor delivery using distribution servers.

As shown in Figure 3, malicious Hancitor documents are hosted on compromised
webservers located at multiple regions globally, or they are hosted on fraud-based accounts
at various hosting providers. After they establish distribution servers for a particular malspam
run, the threat actors use botnet hosts to push malspam with a link to the Hancitor Word
document. This malspam uses several different templates to impersonate legitimate
businesses. These emails are often disguised as invoices, eFax messages, and UPS or
Fedex delivery notifications, to name a few examples. If a victim clicks the embedded link, a
Hancitor document is sent to the victim's computer. Figure 4 shows an example of the
malspam with an embedded URL to download Hancitor in February 2017. This particular
sample was a faked Amazon shipping notification. Obviously, this did not originate from
Amazon: the attackers are using Amazon shipping as the plausible decoy.

Traditionally, the link from these emails include the victim's email address as part of the URL,
sometimes obfusctated using base64 or other encoding. This is likely an attempt by the
Hancitor actors to track the victims who would have successfully downloaded the malicious
Hancitor sample. Two examples seen earlier this year are:
hxxp://[distribution server domain name]/api/getn.php?id=[base64-encoded string
representing recipient's email address]
hxxp://[distribution server domain name]/f.php?sik=[recipient's email address in plain
text]
While investigating the distribution server domains, we found an open directory hosting two
text files: visitor.txt and block.txt (Figure 6.) The visitor.txt file appears to track all
downloads of Hancitor Word documents hosted on that server. The block.txt file appears to
track IP addresses that should be blocked. Many IP addresses in the block.txt file resolved
to Amazon AWS servers. We suspect this list maybe used to block analysis on automated
systems run by security vendors and researchers, by not serving content to IP addresses
known to be analyzing malware.

Since early October 2017, these distribution servers have usually been servers set up
through fraudulent accounts at hosting providers. In September through November 2017,
links from Hancitor malspam occasionally resolved to these domain names without any
additional text in the URL. Figure 6 shows one example.

In recent weeks, links from this malspam have been using a custom encoding to disguise the
recipient's email address in the URL.
Distribution Server Characteristics
Given how actors behind Hancitor malspam leverage compromised servers, we investigated
the numbers and regions where these servers were compromised. The below heat map
provides a high-level overview of the affected countries. The distribution servers seen
throughout the year are located globally. While United States accounts for a large number of
distribution servers, majority of the servers in the United States are from fraudulent accounts
which are hosted at hosting providers. By contrast, the majority of the distribution servers in
the rest of the countries are from compromised servers belonging to legitimate businesses.
According to data from January to September 2017, the majority of compromised domains
used for Hancitor-based infections are located in the Asian region. Most compromised
servers belong to local businesses in each country. While no specific region appears more
vulnerable than others, the domains we've seen so far in 2017 imply that organizations in

Asia, especially small and medium sized businesses may be running vulnerable services
likely to be exploited by the Hancitor campaign to host associated malware.

Table 1 – Number of Distribution Servers by Country
As of December 2017, Hancitor Word documents have most commonly been distributed
through fraudulent accounts at hosting providers. However, during post-infection activity,
Hancitor downloads additional malware from additional distribution servers. These postinfection distribution servers are also legitimate websites that have been compromised by
this campaign, and this characteristic of Hancitor-based infection traffic has been consistent
since we started tracking Hancitor.

Common Services from Compromised Servers
Apart from web servers and other related services, almost all compromised domains were
running PureFTPd or ProFTPd services. This suggests criminals behind Hancitor malspam
may have been targeting servers running vulnerable versions of FTP applications. However,
without any further data, we cannot make any conclusive statements.

Recent Developments
The Hancitor campaign is still evolving. Unit 42 researcher Brad Duncan recently discussed
a wave of Hancitor malspam on October 16th 2017, where Word documents from the
distribution servers used the DDE attack method. In this case, Hancitor was completely
separated from the Word document and downloaded as a separate malware binary. This
9/10

added another distribution server in the infection chain of events.The DDE attack method
spread to other actors for mass-distribution of malware through email. However, by
November 2017, Hancitor resumed using macros in Word documents.
Conclusion
A key factor to this campaign's longevity the abuse of hosting providers, a situation we have
previously reported. Another key factor is the availability of vulnerable servers world-wide
that criminals can compromise to host their malware. These are primary components in the
Hancitor malspam playbook. As discussed in this blog post, we've seen an evolution in their
playbook as criminals behind this campaign have fine-tuned their malware distribution
techniques.Despite a somewhat limited target base of victims who disregard best security
practices an run older versions of Microsoft Windows, the Hancitor campaign has remained
active so far in 2017 with no extended absences. This indicates the campaign's current
playbook remains cost-effective.We continue to keep a close track of this activity for further
developments. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat through our nextgeneration security platform.
