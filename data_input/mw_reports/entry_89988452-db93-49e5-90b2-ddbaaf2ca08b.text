Indictment and 2021 Operations

8

Indictment
The Chinese Threat Group was issued two separate indictments in 2019 and 2020 for malicious activity.
Despite these efforts, the group was still very active in 2021.

• August 15, 2019
• August 11, 2020
• Federal grand jury in Washington, D.C.
• Computer intrusions affecting 100
companies globally
• Indictment did not appear to slow down any
operations

2021 Operations
The indictment did not hinder APT41’s operations as they progressed into 2021. By the end of the year, 13
victims were impacted globally.

• Conducted four different malicious campaigns
• Group-IB, generated 80 notifications for organizations
 Private and government
 In progress, and completed attacks

• Were only able to breach half of the targeted websites
• New techniques were observed
 SQL Injections were performed for initial attack
 Cobalt strike beacons were uploaded in smaller chunks
 Typically employs spear phishing emails, watering holes, or supply chain attacks

10

2021 Operations, part 2
The actor was able to impact victims all over the globe, and targeted political and military groups during
one of their campaigns.

• 13 confirmed victims globally:

 The US, Taiwan, India, Thailand, China, Hong Kong,
Mongolia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Ireland,
Brunei, and the UK

• Targets also included:

 Political groups, military organizations, and airlines

• Working hours were identified:
 Monday – Friday
 UTC +8 time zone

APT41 and Healthcare

13

Targeting Healthcare
• Years healthcare was targeted:
 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019

• 2014 and 2016: Interested in IT and medical device software
 Supply chain attack
 Medical device information was targeted

• 2016: Targeted biotech company
 HR data, tax information, acquisition, and clinical trial data

• 2018: Goals of the campaign were unknown
• 2019: Targeted US cancer research facility
 Malware EVILNUGGET
 CVE-2019-3396 exploited

14

Targeting Healthcare, continued
• Attacks on healthcare
 January -- March 2020

• APT41 was identified as attempting to exploit Citrix, Cisco, and Zoho
endpoints as a part of their campaign
• Attempted to exploit over 75 customers
• Several sectors in the United States were targets
• Attempted exploitation of:
 CVE-2019-19781: Citrix vulnerability which allows directory transversal.
Gives the attacker access to areas of a system they would not normally
have.
 CVE-2020-10189: Zoho vulnerability which allows for remote code
execution that can allow an attacker to deliver malware and advance
malicious efforts.

15

Why Healthcare, and the
Five-Year Plan

16

The 14th Five-Year Plan
Chapter 5 describes seven core industries and ten areas where technology should be cultivated and applied:

• Cloud computing

• Smart transportation

• Big data

• Smart energy

• Internet of things (IoT)

• Smart manufacturing

• Industrial internet

• Smart medicine

• Blockchain

• Smart government

• Artificial intelligence
• Virtual and augmented reality

17

The 14th Five-Year Plan
Chapter 2 of the Fiver-Year Plan lists several areas where China should advance themselves through major
science and technological advancements:

1.New Generation Artificial Intelligence
2.Quantum Information
3.Integrated Circuits (or Semiconductors)
4.Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Research
5.Genetics and Biotechnology
6.Clinical Medicine and Health
7.Deep Sea, Deep Space, and Polar Exploration

18

Recent Activity

19

Recent Activity -- MoonBounce
• Late 2021
• Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Firmware Implant
 Most advance implant found “in the wild”

• Implanted on the SPI flash memory of the motherboard
• Used to deploy additional malware
• High level of sophistication
• Mitigations:
 Updating firmware
 Verifying BootGuard
 Enable trusted Platform Modules

20

Recent Activity -- USAHERDS
Two zero-day attacks were used to exploit the web-based Animal Health Reporting
Diagnostic System (USAHERDS) application.

• May 2021 – February 2022
• Compromised at least six U.S. state governments
• Potentially more unknown victims
• APT41 was quickly detected and removed
• System was compromised via zero-day CVE-2021-44207
and Log4j attacks
• Investigation is still ongoing

21

Recent Activity -- USAHERDS CVEs
Two zero-day attacks were used to compromise the USAHERDS application. One CVE was accessed by using
a MachineKey and the other was from Log4Shell.

• CVE-2021-44207: Zero-day; used hard-coded credentials, allowing the attacker to bypass the
authentication process in the software
 Use of a MachineKey for access
 Unknown how APT41 was able to obtain the key

• CVE-2021-44228: Zero-day in Log4j that causes remote code execution
 Generated payloads to perform reconnaissance
 Deployed variants of the KEYPLUG backdoor

22

Recent Activity -- Government Espionage
• Cyber-espionage activity

 Focused on governments in Asia

• Additional targeting of:

 Aerospace, defense firms, telecom, and IT organizations

• Attacks have been ongoing since 2021
• Previously unseen info stealer

 Keylogging
 Screenshots
 Connecting to and querying SQL databases
 Code injection
 Downloading files
 Stealing clipboard data

• Evidence suggests ties with APT41

23

Popular Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs) and Tools

24

Popular TTPs and Tools
• Initial Access: Frequent use of spear phishing with malicious
attachments, watering holes, and supply chain attacks
• Establish Foothold: The group utilizes a variety of public and
private malware
• Escalate Privileges: Usually leverages custom tools to obtain
credentials
• Internal Reconnaissance: Performs internal reconnaissance
using compromised credentials
• Lateral Movement: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), stolen
credentials, adding admin groups, and brute forcing utilities
• Maintain Presence: APT41 relies on the use of backdoors
• Mission Complete: Creation of a RAR archive for exfiltration and
removal of evidence
