Threat analysts following the activity of LightBasin, a financially motivated group of hackers,
report the discovery of a previously unknown Unix rootkit that is used to steal ATM banking
data and conduct fraudulent transactions.
The particular group of adversaries has been recently observed targeting telecom companies
with custom implants, while back in 2020, they were spotted compromising managed service
providers and victimizing their clients.
In a new report by Mandiant, researchers present further evidence of LightBasin activity,
focusing on bank card fraud and the compromise of crucial systems.

Tapping into your banking data

LightBasin's new rootkit is a Unix kernel module named "Caketap" that is deployed on
servers running the Oracle Solaris operating system.
When loaded, Caketap hides network connections, processes, and files while installing
several hooks into system functions to receive remote commands and configurations.
The commands observed by the analysts are the following:
Add the CAKETAP module back to the loaded modules list
Change the signal string for the getdents64 hook
Add a network filter (format p)
Remove a network filter
Set the current thread TTY to not to be filtered by the getdents64 hook
Set all TTYs to be filtered by the getdents64 hook
Displays the current configuration
The ultimate goal of Caketap is to intercept banking card and PIN verification data from
breached ATM switch servers and then use the stolen data to facilitate unauthorized
transactions.
The messages intercepted by Caketap are destined for the Payment Hardware Security
Module (HSM), a tamper-resistant hardware device used in the banking industry for
generating, managing, and validating cryptographic keys for PINs, magnetic stripes, and
EMV chips.
Caketap manipulates the card verification messages to disrupt the process, stops those that
match fraudulent bank cards, and generates a valid response instead.
In a second phase, it saves valid messages that match non-fraudulent PANs (Primary
Account Numbers) internally and sends them to the HSM so that routine customer
transactions aren't affected and the implant operations remain stealthy.
“We believe that CAKETAP was leveraged by UNC2891 (LightBasin) as part of a larger
operation to successfully use fraudulent bank cards to perform unauthorized cash
withdrawals from ATM terminals at several banks,” explains Mandiant’s report.
Other tools linked to the actor in previous attacks include Slapstick, Tinyshell, Steelhound,
Steelcorgi, Wingjook, Wingcrack, Binbash, Wiperight, and the Mignogcleaner, all of which
Mandiant confirmed as still deployed in LightBasin attacks.

Sophisticated targeting
LightBasin is a highly skillful threat actor that takes advantage of relaxed security in missioncritical Unix and Linux systems that are often treated as intrinsically secure or largely ignored
due to their obscurity.
This is precisely where adversaries like LightBasic thrive, and Mandiant expects them to
continue to capitalize on the same operational strategy.
As for attribution, the analysts spotted some overlaps with the UNC1945 threat cluster but
don’t have any concrete links to draw safe conclusions on that front yet.
