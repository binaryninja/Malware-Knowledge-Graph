BazarLoader to Conti Ransomware in 32 Hours
thedfirreport.com/2021/09/13/bazarloader-to-conti-ransomware-in-32-hours/
September 13, 2021

Intro
Conti is a top player in the ransomware ecosystem, being listed as 2nd overall in the Q2 2021
Coveware ransomware report. The groups deploying this RaaS have only grown more prevalent.
Despite the group having it’s affiliate guide leaked, which revealed many techniques already
covered in previous reports, the group’s using the ransomware are unlikely to let up any time soon.
In July we witnessed a BazarLoader campaign that deployed Cobalt Strike and ended with domain
wide encryption using Conti ransomware.

Case Summary
BazarLoader has continued to be one of the preeminent initial access brokers for ransomware
threat actor access. For this intrusion we don’t know the initial campaign that deployed the malware
but based on previous information, we can assess with high confidence that the delivery vector was
a malicious email campaign. At the time of the intrusion, the group was favoring zip attachments
with malicious javascript files to download the BazarLoader malware. However BazarLoader has
also been used with Word and Excel documents as well.
In this case we observed the initial activity beginning with a BazarLoader DLL. Upon initial
execution on the beachhead, the malware made an initial connection to command and control, and
then a few minutes later it performed discovery tasks on the host using Microsoft utilities like Net

1/23

and Nltest to discover the domain and users of interest. like domain administrators. After this
activity, the host went quiet for about one hour before downloading and executing a Cobalt Strike
beacon DLL.
The threat actors used Cobalt Strike to run additional discovery tasks using Microsoft utilities like
net, ping, systeminfo, and taskmanager. The threat actors then began using pass the hash with
various accounts which continued several times throughout the intrusion. To see what machines
were active in the environment, the threat actors scanned the network for SMB.
Around two and a half hours into the intrusion the threat actors began lateral movement. Lateral
movement began by the threat actor transferring an executable to a remote system and then
executing it using wmic. This was the primary lateral movement option favored by the threat actor,
however PowerShell Cobalt Strike beacons, service executable Cobalt Strike beacons, and RDP
were all used, but less commonly. Once on remote systems the threat actor used Cobalt Strike to
dump lsass memory for further credentials.
After this phase completed, the threat actor’s activity faded but the Cobalt Strike continued to
beacon out to the C2 server. About 12 hours later the threat actors became active again. From the
domain controller the threat actors continued further lateral movement to more servers in the
environment. They also continued further discovery activity running PowerShell scripts to discover
the disk utilization of hosts, review user last login time per host, assess the installed anti-virus
software, and track which hosts were online for the threat actors to target.
When the threat actors identified the file server, their method for data exfiltration was
straightforward to a fault. They downloaded WinSCP from the project website, installed it on the file
server and proceeded to exfiltrate data from the server using SCP to a VPS host they controlled in
Romania.
Around 31 hours after initial access to the environment, the threat actors felt they were ready to
complete their final objectives. RDP activity was seen from several hosts and an executable named
test.exe was transferred to several endpoints. This test file was the Conti ransomware executable,
and the threat actors decided to test in a controlled manner before running the full domain
ransomware deployment. Like before, these “unit tests,” were performed using wmic to execute the
files remotely on the endpoints.
The threat actors must have confirmed quickly that their tests were successful as within minutes
they dropped test.exe renamed to backup.exe on two servers in the environment and executed
manually via their RDP sessions. When executed in this manner the ransomware mounts all remote
C$ drives in the local network and proceeds to encrypt the contents over the SMB connection. At
this point, the Time to Ransom (TTR) for the threat actors was just shy of 32 hours since initial
access.

Services
We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control
frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, BazarLoader, etc. More information
on this service and others can be found here. The Cobalt Strike server used in this intrusion was

2/23

added to our Threat Feed on 07/01/2021.
We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files,
event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and
Organization services.

MITRE ATT&CK
4/23

Initial Access
In this case we did not observe the initial delivery for the malware. BazarLoader however tends to
arrive in an environment via malicious email campaigns and in a few cases its been reported via
call centers social engineering users to load the malware. Seeing that this starts with a DLL file it is
more likely that this was related to an email campaign using malicious zipped Javascript files.

Execution
Initial execution occurred via the Bazarloader DLL being executed by rundll32.
About an hour after the initial execution on the beachhead, a Cobalt Strike beacon was executed
also with rundll32.

Privilege Escalation
The threat actors made use of pass the hash techniques to try to escalate privileges during the
intrusion. Various accounts were targeted including a Guest account initially.

Credential Access
The threat actors were seen dumping credentials out of lsass memory across the domain.

Discovery
The BazarLoader malware on the beachhead began discovery actions around 20 minutes after the
initial execution. The discovery commands utilize the familiar built in Microsoft utilities.
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
net localgroup "administrator"
net group "domain admins" /dom
C:\Windows\system32\net1 group "domain admins" /dom

The Cobalt Strike beacon ran additional discovery tasks on the beachhead. Again built in Microsoft
utilities were utilized.

C:\Windows\System32\Taskmgr.exe

Throughout the intrusion the threat actor checked the time of systems with:
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C time

From an svchost process injected with a Cobalt Strike beacon, SMB scanning was performed
across the environment.

From the domain controller the threat actor ran an encoded PowerShell command to review the
size and condition of hard drives across the environment.
C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
powershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand

Powersploit modules like Get-NetComputer were seen used by the threat actor from the domain
controller
IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:36595/'); Get-NetComputer ping -operatingsystem *server*

The script Get-DataInfo.ps1, which has been used in many intrusions this past year, was also
employed. This file was started by the use of start.bat, which has been seen paired with this script
repeatedly.
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c "C:\\Users\\info\\start.bat"

9/23

powershell.exe -executionpolicy remotesigned -File .\Get-DataInfo.ps1 method

The contents of Get-DataInfo.ps1 provide the threat actor with very specific details of the
environment. This includes things like disk size, connectivity, antivirus software, and backup
software.

This script was first reported used by threat actors deploying the Ryuk ransomware strain.
The Microsoft Active Directory PowerShell module was also imported and used for discovery tasks.
Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select Name, DNSHostName,
OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate | Export-CSV C:\Users\AllWindows.csv -NoTypeInformation Encoding UTF8

Lateral Movement
For lateral movement the threat actors relied heavily on copying executable files over SMB and
then executing them via remote WMIC calls

C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C wmic /node:"DOMAINCONTROLLER" process call create "C:\3.exe"
10/23

While executables and wmic were the preferred options for the threat actor, they did employ several
other techniques.
Remote Cobalt Strike beacons were started with services and PowerShell several times in the
environment.

During the final stages the threat actor used RDP to move between a few servers as part of their
final actions.
At that time, a Cobalt Strike beacon executable was executed as a service on a remote host for
testing the final ransom deployment.

}
}

In addition to these command and control methods, one more network anomaly was observed. This
was not used for primary command and control and the amount of data sent was small so we do
not know the full intentions of the activity but several critical systems like domain controllers and file
servers made connections to TOR nodes initiated by the threat actors.

Exfiltration
The threat actor on the second day of the intrusion downloaded WinSCP to the file server and
proceeded to install the program there.
C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Temp\1\is-HCFKT.tmp\WinSCP-5.19.1-Setup.tmp"
/SL5="$A02B0,10288106,864256,C:\Users\USER\Desktop\WinSCP-5.19.1-Setup.exe"

The threat actor then proceeded to connect over port 22 to a server in Romania.

As the traffic was encrypted we can’t conclusively determine what data was exfiltrated. However we
can infer that the choice to deploy on the file server was due to the data present and ease to move
the data.
Another data point is that following the exfiltration canary documents present in the shares reported
in as being opened from an IP on a Virtual Private Host provider in New York, USA.

Impact

15/23

During the overnight hours of the 2nd day the threat actors began moving on their final objectives.
This included testing their ransomware in the compromised environment before deploying across
the domain.

They initiated RDP connections and a Cobalt Strike beacon executable file to a endpoint not yet
interacted with by the threat actors. The threat actor then transferred a Conti executable file to
several endpoints named test.exe.

These test ransom files were then called remotely using wmic as seen in the previous lateral
movement activity.
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C wmic /node:"ENDPOINT" process call create "C:\test.exe"

After testing on several endpoints, the threat actors dropped a renamed version of the file on
several servers in the environment and executed by hand using their RDP session.

16/23

When executed in this manner, the ransomware payload attempts to spread laterally over SMB.

From there, the threat actors left the environment with this note and domain wide encryption
completed about 32 hours after the initial beachhead BazarLoader was executed.
