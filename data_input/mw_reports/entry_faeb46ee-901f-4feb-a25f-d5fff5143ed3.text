Vigilante malware removes cryptominers from the
infected device

SonicWall CaptureLabs Threats Research Team observed an interesting Android malware
that acts an an anti-hero. Upon infecting a mobile device, it checks for the presence of
specific cryptominers and removes the miner infection from the device and saves the day …
or does it ?
The complete infection cycle can be summarized in two stages as below:

Stage I
Once the malware infects a device it downloads the first stage of the attack payload from
one of the following two sources as of now:
1. hxxp://188.209.52.142/w
2. hxxp://188.209.52.142/c

1/3

This script performs the following tasks:
1. Check the architecture of the infected system and download the second stage of the
attack using wget or curl commands
2. Give appropriate permissions to the second stage and executes it on the device
3. Remove the file downloaded for the second stage and uninstall an app with package
name com.ufo.miner which is a miner similar to ADB miner that we blogged about in
the past

Stage II
Apart from the above mentioned miner, the malware seeks the presence of other miners as
well. It performs device forensics via:
Checking the contents of the memory region for a particular process via
/proc/<pid>/maps
Checking the folders on the device for specific files that are present when a crypto
miner infects a system:
/data/local/tmp/smi
/data/local/tmp/rig
/data/local/tmp/trinity

The malware created a hidden file on the device
named .HqMBksnBExR82Ja with its contents simply
being – ’“”.
It deletes the ELF file (linux executable) from the disk
once it is executed:

Since the malware executes an ELF file (linux executable) there is no easy way for the user
to determine if this file is running on the device. As shown below, the code runs on the
system using a long alphanumeric process name:

Even though it appears that the malware cleans the system from previously installed
cryptominers it is doing so without the user’s permission thereby violating the security
model of Android. It is likely that the malware is cleaning up the system and making room
for something more potent and damaging that may surface in the near future. Regardless,
apps that perform dangerous/suspicious actions in the background without informing the
user cannot be trusted.
It is advisable to keep our Android devices up-to-date with latest security patches and
always ensure that Google Play Protect is running on the device as it provides an added
layer of security by periodically scanning the device for malicious threats.
