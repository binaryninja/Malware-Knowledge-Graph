PREFACE
Since the 1970s, industrial control systems (ICS) networks have provided safe and efficient
monitoring and use in all sectors of critical infrastructure. Department of Defense (DoD) facilities
around the world are heavily dependent on ICS. ICS networks allow operational systems to be
remotely controlled to support the warfighter in various mission spaces.
In the 1990s, in order to leverage newly identified efficiencies in ICS, formerly physically isolated
ICS networks were adapted to interface with the Internet. In the early 2000s, active cyber
threats were still in their infancy. However, today the cyber threat to ICS has grown from an
obscure annoyance to one of the most significant threats to national security (Rogers, 2015).
The threat, coupled with the inherent lack of cyber security and a long-life span for ICS
equipment, has created ideal conditions for a cyber attack causing physical and tangible
repercussions. This has led to a need for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) relative to
the operations of traditional ICS equipment as well as information technology (IT) components.
To better defend DoD ICS, United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) sponsored and
supported the Joint Base Architecture for Secure Industrial Control Systems (J-BASICS) Joint
Test (JT). This JT involved the development, test, evaluation, and refinement of the Advanced
Cyber Industrial Control System (ACI) TTP for DoD ICS. This ACI TTP is designed to enable
managers of ICS networks to Detect, Mitigate, and Recover from nation-state-level cyber
attacks (strategic, deliberate, well-trained, and funded attacks to support greater strategic
objectives).
In his Statement for the Record to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in March 2013,
the United States Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, describes nation-statelevel attacks as being of two types: cyber espionage and cyber attacks. Director Clapper further
describes cyber threats as follows:
A cyber attack is a non-kinetic offensive operation intended to create physical
effects or to manipulate, disrupt, or delete data. It might range from a denialof-service operation that temporarily prevents access to a website, to an
attack on a power turbine that causes physical damage and an outage lasting
for days. Cyber espionage refers to intrusions into networks to access
sensitive diplomatic, military, or economic information.
To further his point, Director Clapper emphasized that there is an increasing risk to critical
infrastructure, “resulting in long-term, wide-scale disruption of services, such as regional power
outages”. It is in the shadow of these threats that this ACI TTP was developed.

ACI TTP

CHAPTER 1: ACI TTP OVERVIEW
1. Purpose
The purpose of this ACI TTP is to provide procedures that will enable IT and ICS managers to
Detect nation-state-level cyber attacks; Mitigate the effects of those attacks; and Recover their
networks following attacks.

2. Scope
The scope of the ACI TTP includes all DoD ICS. DoD ICS, which include supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other control
system configurations, such as skid-mounted programmable logic controllers (PLC) are typical
configurations found throughout the DoD. ICS are often used in the DoD to manage sectors of
critical infrastructure such as electricity, water, wastewater, oil and natural gas, and
transportation.
SCADA systems are generally used to control dispersed assets using centralized data
acquisition and supervisory control. DCS are generally used to control production systems
within a local area such as a factory using supervisory and regulatory control. PLCs are
generally used for discrete control for specific applications and generally provide regulatory
control. These control systems are vital to the operation of the DoD’s critical infrastructures that
are often highly interconnected and mutually dependent systems.
The ACI TTP is designed for ICS networks and the IT components that are used in them. While
the ACI TTP does not include procedures regarding the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router
Network (NIPRNet) and/or the corporate network, it does presume that both are hostile
networks. ICS network staff should not rely on the cyber security infrastructure that these
networks provide and should maintain a level of awareness regarding potential cyber attacks
coming from these networks.

3. How to Use These TTP
This ACI TTP is divided into essentially four sections:
 ACI TTP Concepts (chapters 2 through 4)
 Threat-Response Procedures (Detection, Mitigation, Recovery) (enclosures A, B,
and C)
 Routine Monitoring of the Network and Baselining the Network (enclosures D and E)
 Reference Materials (enclosures F through I and appendix A through D)
a. ACI TTP Concepts. The concepts provide background information to assist in
explaining the scope, prerequisites, applicability, and limitations of the components of
this TTP. The concept chapters should be read prior to responding to indication of
malicious cyber activity.
Chapter 1: ACI TTP Overview

ACI TTP

b. Threat-Response Procedures (Detection, Mitigation, and Recovery). Detection
Procedures (enclosure A) are designed to enable ICS and IT personnel to identify
malicious network activity using official notifications or anomalous symptoms (not
attributed to hardware or software malfunctions). While the TTP prescribes certain
functional areas in terms of ICS or IT, in general each section is designed for execution
by the individuals responsible for the operations of the equipment, regardless of formal
designations. Successful Detection of cyber anomalies is best achieved when IT and
ICS managers remain in close coordination. The Integrity Checks Table (enclosure A,
section A.3, table A.3.1) lists the procedures to use when identifying malicious cyber
activity.
The primary goal of Mitigation Procedures (enclosure B) is to retain operations of the
commander’s functional priorities during an active cyber attack (e.g., electric, water,
etc.). The TTP achieves this goal by segregating the attack, often requiring a
degradation of the network’s functionality. This could include the segregation of some
portion of the ICS while the remaining portions operate under local control (meaning a
loss of centralized control). There are two methodologies to consider when performing
Mitigation: isolation and protection. Enclosure H: Mitigation Isolation and Protection
provides best practices to consider when implementing these Mitigation methods.
Finally, ICS and IT personnel will use the Recovery Procedures (enclosure C) to restore
the ICS to a “fully mission-capable” (FMC) state. The Recovery TTP is complete when
the ICS is fully integrated and tested. The Recovery TTP presumes close coordination
with the command’s Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) and USCYBERCOM
Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs).
c. Baselining and Routine Monitoring of the Network. Before the ACI TTP are adopted,
ICS and IT managers should establish what a FMC network is as it pertains to their
specific installations and missions. The ACI TTP defines FMC as a functional recovery
point for both the ICS and the SCADA. Once this is defined, ICS and IT managers
should capture the FMC condition of their network entry points (e.g., firewalls, routers,
remote access terminals, wireless access points, etc.), network topology, network data
flow, and machine/device configurations, then store these in a secure location. This
information should be kept under configuration management and updated every time
changes are made to the network. This information forms the FMC baseline. The FMC
baseline is used to determine normal operational conditions versus anomalous
conditions of the ICS.
After determining the FMC baseline, routine monitoring of the network should be
performed. Refer to Enclosure D: Suggested Routine Monitoring Procedures.
d. Reference Materials. To further enhance the ACI TTP as a tool, operators are
encouraged to refer to additional resources provided by the Industrial Control Systems

Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800 Computer Security series (see
Appendix D: References).

4. Navigating Detection, Mitigation, and Recovery Procedures
Detection, Mitigation, and Recovery Procedures are contained within enclosures A through C.
While Detection Procedures lead to Mitigation Procedures, and Mitigation Procedures lead to
Recovery Procedures, each enclosure can also be executed as a stand-alone resource as well
as be incorporated into local procedures. The following is an overview for navigating the
Detection, Mitigation, and Recovery portions of the TTP.
a. Detection. When a notification is received or an anomalous symptom is observed, the
operator should locate the symptom on the Event Diagnostics Table (enclosure A.1,
table A.1.1). After locating and investigating the event diagnostics (which includes
eliminating any non-cyber causes for the anomaly), the operator is directed to the
Integrity Checks Table (enclosure A, section A.3, table A.3.1). These checks provide
actions which assists the operator in determining whether a cyber event is in progress or
not. The operator returns to the diagnostic procedure and then decides either to continue
with another integrity check or exit the procedure by moving to the Mitigation section or
returning to the Routine Monitoring section (enclosure D). In the case of malicious cyber
activity, specific reporting procedures are provided. The operator is then directed to
notify the ISSM and request permission to move to the Mitigation section.
b. Mitigation. If the ISSM confirms permission to move to the Mitigation section, the
operator’s first priority is to isolate any compromised assets, and protect the
commander’s mission priority through segmentation. This segmentation is based on a
predetermined segmentation strategy. After this step is complete, the operator next
ensures that local control has been achieved. After the system is stabilized, the operator
can make a request to the ISSM to proceed to the Recovery section.
c. Recovery. Recovery actions follow Mitigation actions. While the TTP addresses specific
Recovery actions, operators may need to execute investigations, incident response
plans, and various other overarching command guidelines prior to executing any
Recovery actions. Operators should ensure familiarity with these policies and guidelines.
Figure 1-1 depicts the high-level overview of the ACI TTP beginning with Detection, progressing
to Mitigation, and then further progressing to Recovery.

5. Maintaining Operational Resilience
As cyber attacks have become focused and relevant in the world of cyber warfare, the DoD has
moved from a position of “system hardening” to a posture of maintaining operational resilience.
With the release of Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8500.01, Cybersecurity, in March
of 2014, the DoD addresses the fact that cyber attacks are inevitable, and adversaries will
succeed to some degree. Therefore, it is incumbent upon all operational areas of the DoD to be
prepared to meet these three conditions: ensure systems are trustworthy, ensure the mission of
the organization is prepared to operate with degraded capabilities, and ensure systems have
the means to prevail in the face of adverse events.
The ACI TTP provides ICS operators with a means to use both best practices and procedures in
the defense of the ICS, to degrade the ICS, if necessary, and to maintain system operations
during an active cyber attack.

6. CIA Triad
One significant difference between IT and ICS can be understood through the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. This triad is a model, designed to guide policies for
information security within an organization. While each part of the triad is important, in IT the
emphasis is on confidentiality and integrity. In the ICS environment, availability is the most
important part of the triad. Blocked or delayed information flows can disrupt ICS operation. As a
result, it is important to consider the impact common IT tools could have on an ICS network. For
example, using host-based security system or Network Mapper (NMap) on an ICS network
could shut down the network and disrupt operations. This is important to remember when
baselining, testing, or monitoring ICS networks.

7. Operational Security Log
There are instructions throughout the ACI TTP threat-response procedures sections
(enclosures A through C) to record information in a Security Log. An operational Security Log is
a written organizational record of events such that a reconstruction of events could occur to
illustrate, over time, the adversarial cyber events that occurred on an ICS/IT network as well as
the organizational actions to Detect and/or counteract them.
Table 1-1 is an example Operational Security Log. A log should be designed to reflect and
accommodate your environment and organizational requirements.

2. Detection Overview
Detection through user observation is an “after-the-fact” activity. Relying on observable system
behaviors carries a degree of risk. After-the-fact means an intrusion has occurred and the attack
is in the process of delivering its payload. This payload could be either something that is focused
on destruction or exfiltration. The result of relying on this level of Detection could mean damage to
the physical system or equipment, loss of critical data, alterations in software configuration that
could produce undesirable effects to field devices, or the injection of malware that could deny the
operations of the system or alter its behavior.
Given the numerous possible effects, the Detection Procedures (enclosure A) are designed to
Detect a malicious cyber event as early as possible. The basic actions involved with Detection are
Routine Monitoring, inspection, and transition to the Mitigation Procedures (enclosure B).
Embedded within each of these phases are investigation and decision points.
Routine Monitoring is one of two potential entry points to the Detection phase. ICS operators
execute daily monitoring routines. These consist of performing periodic equipment checks, tuning
loops, checking set points, etc. The ACI TTP adapts the concept of routine maintenance
monitoring to the cyber security world by including suggested Routine Monitoring activities. Refer
to enclosure D. This enclosure provides monitoring activity best practices involving routine checks
that can be integrated into normal ICS operations and monitoring schedules.
When an anomalous event is observed during Routine Monitoring, or an official notification of a
cyber attack is received; the IT or ICS operator should immediately enter the Detect portion of the

Chapter 2: ACI TTP Detection Phase

2-1

ACI TTP

TTP (enclosure A). The first step in the Detection portion of the TTP is to consult the Event
Diagnostics Table (enclosure A, section A.1, table A.1.1).

3. Detection Process
ACI TTP Entry Points
1. Anomalies found during Routine Monitoring
2. Command directives, Warning Order (WARNORDS), ICS-CERT Notices or
other official notifications
In the absence of a WARNORD or other notification, and in the absence of anomalous symptoms,
the ACI TTP assumes operators are conducting Routine Monitoring Procedures.
a. If during the process of executing Routine Monitoring a cyber notification is issued,
operators should execute the Official Notifications procedure listed in the Event
Diagnostics Table (section A.1). This table has a column containing types of system or
network behaviors that were observed, associated with an event, and page numbers
directing to related diagnostic procedures.
b. If anomalous symptoms are observed, operators should investigate to determine if these
are hardware/software malfunctions or administrative issues. If the anomaly cannot be
explained or corrected through normal troubleshooting activities, operators should check
for a cyber event using the Event Diagnostics Table (section A.1). Operators should locate
the observed symptoms and execute the Detection steps associated with the observed
events located in enclosure A. Once located, the operators should continue to the specific
diagnostic procedure in the Event Diagnostic Procedures (section A.2).
c. Each Event Diagnostic Procedure identifies one or more Integrity Check (enclosure A,
section A.3, Integrity Checks, table A.3.1). Integrity Checks are in order of suggested
priority. However, the order of Integrity Checks and the selection of Integrity Checks
should be based on the operators’ knowledge, experience, training, local policy and
procedures, and the events associated with the event resulting in the use of the ACI TTP.
After each integrity check is completed, return to the diagnostic procedure.
d. If at any time a Severity Level of High is identified, exit the Detect phase and request a
transition from Detection to Mitigation from the ISSM.
e. Routine Monitoring involves regular maintenance procedures conducted routinely by
operators of ICS, infused with cyber monitoring activities. Cyber Routine Monitoring
provides ICS operators with a set of activities that can be modified and adapted to full
compliance with the DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD
Information Technology (IT), dated March 12, 2014 (Appendix D: References).

CHAPTER 3: ACI TTP MITIGATION CONCEPTS
1. Mitigation Introduction
a. Definition. The actions taken that allow the ICS network to continue operating after the
operator has separated the affected device and/or network segment to prevent the
propagation of the adversarial presence and to establish control to allow end-state
processes to continue to operate at the command-directed level without interference.
b. Key Components
(1) Protect the information network
(2) Acquire and protect data for analysis
(3) Maintain operations during an active attack
c. Prerequisites
(1) Identification of evidence of an adversarial presence
(2) Appropriate notifications and reporting have been initiated
(3) Security Log
d. Mitigation Scope
(1) The ACI TTP cannot determine the scope of Mitigation required or necessary for every
situation because ICS and IT systems differ greatly across the DoD. There are outside
factors that may inform the scope of the Mitigation. It is the responsibility of the ISSM
and outside resources to determine what Mitigation scope is appropriate for an
incident. The operator and ISSM should have criteria in place for their specific system
prior to an event, because this will assist them in determining the best course of action
to take if an incident requires Mitigation. Enclosure H: Mitigation Isolation and
Protection can assist in creating a Mitigation Plan.
(2) Organizations should consider the following factors to assist in determining the scope
of Mitigation (in addition to any factors identified through the organization’s risk
management process):
a. Severity Level of the incident
b. Criticality of the system affected
c. Layer the incident resides on or affects
d. Whether the incident affects end-state processes
e. Operations that the system is controlling
f. Outside influences and events
(3) Once the scope of Mitigation has been determined and approved by the ISSM, the
operators will utilize the instructions in the Mitigation Procedures (enclosure B) to
assist them in conducting the Mitigation step most appropriate for the incident and the
system it is affecting.

2. Mitigation Overview
The purpose of the Mitigation phase is to isolate and prevent further malicious activity while
enabling the network and its endpoint devices to continue to execute its mission, even if it is in a
reduced capacity.
The Mitigation phase begins when the operator is directed to the Mitigation Procedures
(enclosure B) from an event diagnostic procedure within the Detection phase. The intent of the
Mitigation phase is to protect the information system and network by ensuring that a cyber
incident does not further propagate into the ICS system, and to acquire and protect data for
analysis while maintaining operations during an active attack. This is achieved through the use of
Mitigation actions linked to potential attack vectors which can be utilized to Mitigate a number of
attacks against the ICS/SCADA.
The Mitigation Procedures build upon the Detection actions taken in the previous section to
provide the operator with a procedural route to execute during an incident.

3. Mitigation Process
a. Cyber Incident Analysis. It is important to note that Mitigation actions can very easily destroy
information or forensic evidence that could be useful in follow-on technical analysis of an
incident. As such, it may become necessary to conduct Mitigation Procedures without
performing technical analysis to keep the system operational. This should be performed only
after careful consideration has been given to this fact and with commander approval.
Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 6510.01B, Cyber Incident Handling
Program, dated July 10, 2012, (appendix A, section AA.15) provides Department of Defense
cyber incident handling procedures for routine responses to cyber events and incidents.
According to CJCSM 6510.01B, “The information system will not be shut down or
disconnected from the information network prior to acquiring and preserving the data unless
authorized by the Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP) or command
authority.”
When possible, all data should be acquired and preserved for further analysis. This includes
volatile data, persistent data, and environmental data. If the situation does not permit this
collection of data due to mission-critical responsibilities, the command authority must
approve that the data acquisition will not be completed. For additional information on
forensic analysis, please refer to Enclosure G: Data Collection for Forensics.
b. Cyber Incident Response. Organizations must be prepared in advance for any Mitigation.
Decisions made in haste while responding to a critical incident could lead to further
unintended consequences. Therefore, Mitigation Procedures, tools, defined interfaces, and
communications channels and mechanisms should be in place and previously tested.

Chapter 3: ACI TTP Mitigation Phase

3-2

ACI TTP

c. Mitigation Course of Action (COA). Develop a plan that lists the specific Mitigation steps to
take and which identifies the personnel by job description that should take those steps. In
this way, when an incident does occur, appropriate personnel will know how to respond.
Escalation procedures and criteria must also be in place to ensure effective management
engagement during Mitigation actions.
Organizations must define acceptable risks for incident containment and develop strategies
and procedures accordingly. This should be conducted during annual risk management
activities.
Various questions arise when deciding whether to contain malicious or unauthorized activity.
Answers to these questions may require discussions with IT and business process owners.
Such questions might include:
(1) Is it appropriate to shut down or disconnect an information system?
(2) Do local system administrators and operators have the authority to shut down or
disconnect an information system?
(3) When must an information system stay up and running?
(4) Which information systems cannot be taken offline or disconnected?
(5) Are there investigative or intelligence equities to consider?
Organizations should develop appropriate containment strategies for critical assets in
advance of Mitigation. By preparing in this way, the need for decision-making will not occur
at the time of an incident.
d. Jump-Kit Mitigation. Actions may at times require the use of the Jump-Kit discussed in
Enclosure F: Jump-Kit. This Jump-Kit can be used for analysis and for taking local control of
devices.
e. Caveats for Mitigation. Do not physically reconnect any piece of equipment until you have
verified that it is clean, configured properly, and performing correctly as detailed in
Enclosure C: Recovery Procedures.

(3) Systematically Recover each affected device
(4) Systematically reintegrate devices, processes, and network segments
(5) Test and verify system to ensure devices are not re-infected
c. Prerequisites

(2) Appropriate notifications and reporting has occurred
(3) Response Jump-Kit
(4) Baseline documentation

2. Recovery Overview
CJCSM 6510.01B requires development of a COA for response to cyber incidents. The
Recovery ACI TTP (enclosure C) is intended to be supplemental to the CJCSM 6510.01B
COAs. More information regarding CJCSM 6510.01B is located in appendix A, section AA.15.
Because of the wide variance in ICS/SCADA system design and applications, the Recovery
Procedures (enclosure C) associated with the ACI TTP are not specific to a particular make or
model of equipment but are general in terms of application.
The operator must not proceed with Recovery Procedures without proper authorization and
should consult with the ISSM prior to proceeding with those Recovery Procedures. A CPT from
outside your organization may be called upon to direct the Recovery process. The main focus of
the CPT is to preserve forensic evidence for analysis of the cyber incident and to provide
technical assistance as required. If directed, the operator may proceed with Recovery
Procedures without the assistance of a CPT. Every effort should be made to preserve evidence
of the cyber incident for forensic analysis whenever feasible.
In the event of a crisis or national emergency, restoration of the systems affected by the attack
may take precedence over efforts to preserve forensic evidence. Ensure that proper
authorization is received in order to proceed in this manner.
A cyber incident is a reportable event per CJCSM 6510.01B. Operators should record all
Recovery actions. These records will be used as part of post-cyber incident forensics
investigation, and will aid in reducing the likelihood of a recurrence of the cyber incident.

ACI TTP

3. Recovery Process
a. The Recovery phase begins once the system under attack has been stabilized and
infected equipment has been isolated from the network. Recovery of the systems will
require the use of the resources located in the Jump-Kit, the IT and ICS system
schematics, and the wiring and logic diagrams, and may require vendor assistance.
Successful Recovery of the ICS system after the cyber incident will depend upon the
technical knowledge and skills of the ICS and IT operators and will require a high level of
communication and consultation between these team members and with the ISSM.
b. Because of the wide variance in ICS/SCADA system design and applications, these
Recovery Procedures are not specific to a particular make or model of equipment but
are general in terms of application.
c. The preferred method of Recovery is the removal and replacement of affected devices
with off-the-shelf replacements. This method ensures that recovered devices are
uncontaminated when reintegrated into the network and will aid in preservation of
forensic evidence of the cyber attack for analysis. If replacement devices are not
available, the second best option is to reimage affected devices with known good
firmware and/or software. Whenever possible in this scenario, efforts should be made to
save a copy of the infected firmware/software for forensic analysis. Vendor assistance
may be required in order to perform these tasks.
d. Additional key points to effective Recovery include technical issues, mission priorities,
and cyber issues:
(1) Technical Issues. Recovery requires the ability to reintegrate affected devices into
operation after they have been replaced or verified to be clean of any remnants from
a cyber incident. This TTP cannot provide specific detailed instructions on how to
reintegrate each device for the wide variety of networks known to exist. The
Recovery team will be required to determine the sequence of device reintegration in
order to ensure minimal effect on the operation of any critical assets in the network,
and to avoid recontamination of recently cleaned devices.
(2) Mission Priorities. The sequence of Recovery and reintegration of recovered devices
will depend on the mission-critical need for systems affected based upon the
requirements set forth by mission commanders. Be sure to consult with your ISSM
and/or chain of command to ensure you are prioritizing the sequence of the
Recovery process as required by your command.
(3) Cyber Issues. Critical to effective Recovery reintegration is ensuring that newly
recovered devices will not be re-infected. The best way to avoid this problem is to
verify that each device on the network is clean of any cyber incident remnants. All
devices in the network should be replaced or re-flashed with known, good
firm/software to provide confidence that re-infection will not occur. If expedience for
Recovery of the network takes precedence over this conservative rationale, a risk
analysis should be performed in consultation with the ISSM and/or your chain of
command. The risk analysis should consider the likelihood of re-infection of newly
recovered devices when reconnecting to devices in the network.

Chapter 4: ACI TTP Recovery Phase

4-2

ACI TTP

4. Sequences and Reintegration for Recovery
a. Mission Commander Priorities. The procedure for sequencing recovered devices should
be based upon priorities established by the commander or the ISSM. Critical mission
requirements and system interdependencies will be factors to consider in sequencing
the Recovery process. For example, if mission requirements demand that the critical
server heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are to be returned to
service first, interdependency dictates that the electric power system should be
recovered first since the HVAC cannot operate without it.
b. Reintegration. Once the sequencing process has been established, the reintegration
process should follow systematic steps that Recover individual devices first. Prior to
performing reintegration of affected components, consult with the ISSM and use the
records created while performing these procedures to ensure that remnants of the cyber
attack have been cleaned from every component affected. Once individual devices in a
functional group have been tested, reintegrate the sub-system (functional equipment
groups) and, finally, reintegrate the network layers. Always verify each device is free
from malware and abnormal behavior prior to reconnecting it to adjacent devices.
c. Recovery. Recovered networks should have stringent monitoring in place to ensure all
evidence of the cyber incident has been eliminated from the network.

A-22

Any anomalous behavior coming from field devices could be
hardware malfunctions or communication path malfunctions.
However, once these have been ruled out, a cyber incident
should be considered as the possible source of the problem.
Changes to the controller logic within the field device could come
from a process that has been altered, a new process that has
been implemented, an old process that was removed, or a
process that was sabotaged.

A-23

If false information is sent to the control system, it could either
be an error, or a malicious attempt to disguise unauthorized
changes or an initiation of inappropriate actions by system
operators.
Anomalous modifications to the safety system could come from
an error in the system, accidental misconfiguration, or some
other explained event. If the change to the safety system cannot
be explained, the changes could be malicious with the intention
of damaging the control system.

ENCLOSURE B: MITIGATION PROCEDURES
B.1. Mitigation Segmentation
Before continuing with the Recovery Procedures, ensure that permission has been obtained
from the ISSM or other equal or higher authority. Please be aware that Mitigation may be
disruptive to operations and may require additional resources.
The Network Mitigation Segmentation process will be determined by the specific network
architecture of the affected network. This process is dependent on the following:

 Locating connections in the network which provide interconnection between separate
functional networked sub-systems, enclaves, or layers. (Refer to enclosure E for guidance in
assessing the Baseline configuration of your network to aid in locating these connections.)

 Maintaining the functionality of the ICS end process with Network Mitigation Segmentation in
place.

Mitigation Segmentation Procedure
LOCATE all connections in your network which reside on the boundaries of your subsystem, enclave, or layer. Refer to your FMC Baseline to assist in determining the
location of these connections. DETERMINE the following:
The points in your network where a connection exists which provide a potential
communications path for malicious external command and control of the system (for
example, connections which lead to the Internet, at a switch, firewall, or router).
AND/OR
The points in your network where a connection exists to adjacent networks which provide
a potential communications path for malware to propagate between the adjacent
networks or sub-systems.
Communication paths to the Internet can be utilized for malicious external command and
control. DISCONNECT the network cable(s) connecting the network to the Internet.
Communication paths to adjacent networks or sub-systems can provide a
communications path for malware to propagate. DISCONNECT the network cable(s)
connecting to adjacent networks or sub-systems.
DOCUMENT all actions taken in the Security Log for after-incident analysis.
Closely MONITOR the operation of the ICS process(es). If any adverse effects are noted
as a result of the network isolation, RECONNECT the network and continue to closely

MAINTAIN primary power (if possible) to the HMI until an image can be saved of the
device’s memory.
SAVE an image of the configuration software and volatile memory (if possible and
unless otherwise directed) for forensic analysis.
REMOVE AND REPLACE the affected HMI. Device replacement will preserve
forensic evidence of the cyber incident for analysis
If a replacement HMI is not available, REMOVE AND REPLACE the hard drive (if
installed) with a back-up drive containing software from a trusted, known good source.
DO NOT REIMAGE any devices unless authorized by the ISSM or CPT. Reimaging
the affected HMI will destroy forensic evidence of the cyber incident.
If a replacement HMI or hard drive is not available, REIMAGE the affected HMI from a
trusted, known good back-up source.
Rootkit infections/detections will require REFLASHING of the BIOS on the
server/workstation. An example of generic BIOS reflash procedure follows. Check your
vendor documentation for specific instructions for your device. Before you REFLASH
the BIOS:
a. DISABLE BIOS Flash Protection in the BIOS setup.
b. VERIFY the BIOS version update is the correct BIOS for your machine.
c. Do not interrupt the BIOS when updating; improper BIOS flashing will result in
system malfunctions.
d. When the BIOS REFLASH is complete, ENABLE BIOS Flash Protection in the
BIOS setup menu.

ENCLOSURE D: SUGGESTED ROUTINE MONITORING PROCEDURES
D.1. Routine Monitoring Introduction
a. Description. Routine Monitoring includes a set of activities that allow ICS managers and
operators to maintain an on-going awareness of the security posture of their ICS.
Routine Monitoring activities are designed to integrate with normal ICS operations and
not to interfere with the natural workflows of ICS operators. Ideally, Routine Monitoring
should be integrated with maintenance checks or other routine activities associated with
the ICS.
b. Key Components
(1) Severity Level
(2) Routine Monitoring Schedule (table D-1)
c. Prerequisites
(1) Establish cyber condition
(2) Develop Routine Monitoring Schedule
(3) Integrate Routine Monitoring into daily schedule
(4) FMC baseline

D.2. Routine Monitoring Overview
Routine Monitoring activities are divided into IT and ICS activities. This enclosure forms the
basis for the ACI TTP Routine Monitoring activities. This enclosure can be amended and
changed to meet the command’s particular needs. The Routine Monitoring Schedule and
Procedures are a managerial document and should be completed and maintained by the ICS
manager. This enclosure was designed as a stand-alone document.

Routine Monitoring:
Overview


What you will need to perform Routine Monitoring:
1. Routine Monitoring checks
2. Routine Monitoring schedule
3. FMC baseline documents binder
Step
Routine Monitoring Procedure
1.

COMPARE expected normal ICS activity to observed ICS activity, and search for
differences (which are also called anomalies throughout this TTP).
a. If an anomaly is found, LOCATE anomaly (or the closest description of the
anomaly) in Enclosure A: Detection Procedures, A.1.1 Event Diagnostics Table.
FOLLOW the instructions in the Event Diagnostics Table. The instructions will
lead to:
(1) An evaluation of the anomaly.

Enclosure D: Routine Monitoring

D-1

ACI TTP

Routine Monitoring:
Overview

2.
3.

(2) A ranking of the anomaly’s Severity Level.
(3) A list of next steps.
b. Once the anomaly event has been resolved, ICS operators should RETURN to
Routine Monitoring activities.
c. If the ICS activity is normal, Routine Monitoring should continue as prescribed in
the command’s ICS Routine Monitoring schedule.
The following steps (instructions) provide details for the use of this enclosure.
Establish INFOCON: CONTACT the ISSM and obtain the INFOCON status.
a. If the INFORCON status is normal, the periodicity of Routine Monitoring is
accomplished during normal operations, using normal monitoring checks.

4.

5.

b. If the INFOCON is elevated, integrate checks marked “2nd Stage Monitoring” into
Routine Monitoring Schedule.
Develop Routine Monitoring Schedule: IT (or ICS) personnel conduct these checks.
If IT personnel are not assigned to the ICS, work with the command Network
Engineers and ISSM to integrate event checking for ICS. The Routine Monitoring tasks
are divided into the following sections:
a. Security Events: events occurring on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS),
firewalls, virus checkers, and Syslogs, or Security Information and Event
Management (SIEMs) if available.
b. Computer Assets: servers, workstations, to include HMI, Historians, OPC, and
engineering workstations. Checks normally conducted by IT or ICS operators.
c. Network Flow: IT operators generally check network data flows.
d. Synchronicity Check: HMI, OPC, engineering workstation checks against
controller status. ICS operator personnel conduct these checks.
e. Synchronicity Check: controllers to endpoint device status checks conducted by
ICS operators.
f. Historian: status check for abnormal activities. Checks conducted by either IT or
ICS operators.
Integrating Routine Monitoring Into Daily Schedule: Routine Monitoring
Procedures are designed to integrate with daily routines found in an ICS environment.
a. Map each Routine Monitoring task to the individuals most likely to perform the
check.
b. Extract Routine Monitoring instructions and tables (make copies as needed) and
integrate these with daily ICS procedures. These procedures can include safety
monitoring procedures, meter recording procedures, equipment monitoring,
“tuning loops,” and operations checks.
c. EXTRACT the Routine Monitoring Schedule (table D-1 below), and annotate it
with the area being monitored, the individual(s) conducting the check, days

d. REVIEW Routine Monitoring Procedures with individuals conducting checks,
and ensure procedures are understood.
e. EXECUTE Routine Monitoring Schedule.
f. If the command is operating at an elevated INFOCON level, in addition to
executing the Routine Monitoring Schedule, EXECUTE the 2nd Stage Monitoring
checks as well.

ENCLOSURE E: FULLY MISSION-CAPABLE (FMC) BASELINE
E.1. FMC Baseline Introduction
a. Description. The FMC baseline consists of documentation that characterizes the ICS
system.
b. Key Components
(1) Topology diagram
(2) Enclave entry points
(3) User accounts
(4) Server/workstation documentation
(5) Network documentation

E.2. FMC Baseline Overview
a. Before the ACI TTP can be executed, operators should have several system
characteristics documented. This documentation forms the system’s current FMC
baseline. Documenting the FMC baseline does not imply the system may not already
have an adversary present. In fact, many systems might have an adversary present. If
an adversary is present, and that adversary is lying in wait, if the adversary moves
laterally or attempts to communicate or otherwise initiate an exploit (and eventually the
adversary will), the ACI TTP is designed to Detect that type of movement by comparing
system characteristics to its baseline.
b. This section provides specific details for developing the FMC baseline of an ICS. The
FMC Baseline establishes normal ICS behavior. During Routine Monitoring and the
Detection Phase of the ACI TTP, normal behaviors are compared to observed
behaviors. If observed behaviors deviate from normal behaviors, these are either by
design (approved and intentional) or anomalous (unapproved, unintentional, not
communicated, or nefarious).

E.3. FMC Baseline Procedures
The procedures for establishing an FMC Baseline involve the following:
(1) Produce ICS Topology Diagram
(2) Document network traffic entering and exiting the ICS in Enclave Entry Point Chart
on page E-4
(3) Document server/workstation user accounts; normal tasks and processes;
connecting devices with ports, protocols, and services
(4) Document normal network traffic

2. Laptop with Internet access (for downloads)
3. If available, network mapping tool for ICS
4. Plant documentation listing devices and their locations
5. A binder with label: FMC Baseline Documents

E.4. FMC Baseline Instructions
The ICS Topology Diagram describes which devices are located at which locations and how
they connect. Generating an ICS Topology Diagram is accomplished using automated tools
specifically designed for ICS in conjunction with manual “walk through” or simply using a manual
“walk through” and inventory information or schematics if automated tools are not available.
a. Capture Assets
If you are using a network scanner, such as NMap (using SCADA script) or Nessus (with
SCADA Plugin) or another tool that can provide an enumeration of live hosts on SCADA,
scan your network to identify live assets.
(1) Most scanning tools do not capture the location of devices that are not active. These
devices are located when validating the active device list.
(2) If a scanning tool is not available, use existing ICS documentation (inventory lists
and schematics) to capture a list of assets deployed in the ICS.
b. Validate Active Hosts
(1) Validate active hosts and locate inactive assets by walking through the ICS
installation, documenting the assets located and how they are connected.
a. Create an ICS Topology Diagram, which includes the assets you located, the
connections, IP addresses, and location of the asset using the tools made
available by your command. Figure E-1 shows an example of an ICS Topology
Diagram.
b. Store the ICS Topology Diagram in the binder entitled FMC Baseline Documents.
c. NOTE: For your site, ensure your diagram includes IP addresses, make and
model of device, and operating system.

external networks. This can be a router or firewall connecting the command’s enterprise,
virtual private network (VPN) connections (possibly connecting to an engineering
workstation), wireless connections, and any asset vendors use to connect from
corporate locations to the ICS.
c. Go to the identified devices, and extract the information required by the table using the
instructions for that device.
d. Enter the information into the table in the appropriate columns. See example table E-2

E.7. FMC Baseline Creation: Network Traffic
a. Capturing the normal data flow for the ICS provides a baseline view of the traffic that is
“normal” for that ICS. The network traffic of an ICS should not be overly “busy” and
should appear logical and reasonable to the operators (e.g., the OPC server and the field
controllers should show communications between each other). Once the normal network
traffic is captured and understood, identifying anomalous traffic is a straightforward event.
b. Procedures
(1) If your ICS has Cisco devices, locate those devices and determine if those devices
are NetFlow enabled (check Cisco web site).
(a) If the Cisco devices are NetFlow enabled, locate the device on the topology and
determine what potential traffic can be viewed from that device (which device
connections flow through the device).
(b) Using your Cisco documentation, determine how to capture network flows, and
view these. To effectively baseline your network, allow NetFlow to capture
24 hours of ICS network traffic. Once the 24-hour network traffic has been
captured, analyze the traffic and identify the individual IP addresses, the ports,
protocols, and services associated with these, and document them in table E-4:
ICS Data Flow.
(2) If your ICS does not have Cisco devices, a variety of free tools can be used to
capture data flows on the network. Work with your command’s network administrator
and the ISSM for assistance in installing these tools and capturing your ICS data
flows.
(a) Select a method to capture network data, and capture the data for 24 hours.
Analyze data, and populate table E-4 IP addresses, ports, protocols, and
services located during the capture.
(b) The following tools are free and can be used to capture network data flows:
NetworkMiner, Microsoft Network Monitor, BandwidthD, PRTG Network Monitor
Freeware, Splunk, ntopng, WireShark.
(3) Extract table E-4 from this document and enter the IP addresses, ports, protocols
and services located in the data flow capture.

ENCLOSURE F: JUMP-KIT
F.1. Jump-Kit Introduction
a. Description. A Recovery Jump-Kit contains the tools the ICS team and IT team will need
to restore a system to its last FMC state during Mitigation and Recovery. Knowing what
the Recovery point should be is the key to ensuring all known remnants of an attack
have been removed from all components of the ICS. This means all hardware and
software are configured in accordance with operational requirements, and checksums
and hashes are in conformance with vendor specifications.
b. Key Components
(1) Routine Monitoring
(2) Inspection
(3) Identification of adversarial presence
(4) Documentation
(5) Notifications
c. Prerequisites. FMC baseline

F.2. Jump-Kit Contents
a. Overview
(1) The Jump-Kit is a critical tool for the Recovery phase. In addition to containing the
operating software for all devices, it also contains the software hashes of the devices
on the network and the firmware and software updates for all system devices.
(2) During Recovery, the Jump-Kit will be utilized to reimage the firmware/software
operating on the affected device. Care shall be used when the Jump-Kit machine is
used for the reinstallation/reimaging potentially infected devices. The malware
residing on the device, which is being reimaged, could manifest itself onto the JumpKit machine, which could then re-infect other system devices when reconnected.
(3) Due to this potential back door access for malware, ensure that the Jump-Kit
machine is connected only to network devices that are completely isolated from the
network. Additionally, the Jump-Kit should be write-protected and/or operating in a
virtual environment. Virus scans are performed after connection to each device.
(4) The ICS Jump-Kit and the IT Jump-Kit can be combined or be separate depending
on the environment and system architecture. In general, a Recovery Jump-Kit should
include the following:
Jump-Kit Contents: Documentation
 Incident Notifications List: document contact information for command’s
Information Assurance Manager
 Document stakeholders who could be affected by a Cyber attack on ICS
 Establish notification procedures with chain of command

Enclosure F: Jump-Kits

ENCLOSURE G: DATA COLLECTION FOR FORENSICS
G.1. Data Collection for Forensics Introduction
a. Description. Data collection for forensics involves the acquisition of volatile and nonvolatile data from a host, a network device, and ICS field controllers. Memory acquisition
involves copying the contents for volatile memory to transportable, non-volatile storage.
Data acquisition is copying non-volatile data stored on any form of media to
transportable, non-volatile storage. A digital investigator seeks to preserve the state of
the digital environment in a manner that allows the investigator to reach reliable
inferences through analysis. (Ligh, 2014)
b. Key Components
(1) Volatile memory
(2) Non-volatile data
(3) Collection
(4) Documentation
(5) Notifications
c. Prerequisites
(1) Administrative tools for acquisition
(2) Storage devices to capture and transport evidence

G.2. Documentation of Data Collection
a. It is important to document environmental observations of what the device is doing, its
symptoms and anomalies, and if the device is currently running or shut down. It is also
important to note who has had access to the device and what the person did—if any
actions were taken. Also include documents for each step that is taken while acquiring
data for forensics. This includes the following:
(1) Information on the specific device (i.e., make, model, identification number, location,
etc.)
(2) The tools or utilities used to capture the data
(3) The commands or steps that were taken
(4) The device used to store the data
(5) If the data was collected remotely or locally

the stored information; it retains its contents while powered on, but when the power is
interrupted the stored data is immediately lost.
b. Non-Volatile Memory. Non-volatile computer memory is stored data that can be retrieved
even after having the power cycled. Examples of non-volatile memory include read-only
memory, flash memory, most types of magnetic computer storage devices and hard
disks, floppy disks, magnetic tape, and optical discs.

ENCLOSURE H: MITIGATION ISOLATION AND PROTECTION
H.1. Isolation and Protection Introduction
a. Description. Isolation and protection are two approaches to segmenting an ICS
environment. Isolation contains an infected or compromised device, network segment, or
other grouping of ICS assets. Protection ensures that critical ICS assets are protected
from other compromised parts of the ICS system.
b. Key Components
(1) Mitigation strategy
(2) Network diagrams
(3) Process dependencies
c. Prerequisites
(1) Knowledge of networks
(2) Knowledge of processes

H.2. Isolation and Protection Overview
a. The Mitigation Phase is meant to assist in protecting ICS during or after a cyber attack.
There are two aspects to Mitigation: (1) containment and segmentation, and
(2) establishing control to ensure end-state processes continue to operate. Containment
and segmentation are the procedures for separating one asset, or group of assets, from
other assets or networks.
(1) Isolation segments the affected assets to prevent it from affecting other assets. For
example, if an HMI workstation were compromised, the workstation would be
disconnected from the network. This would contain or limit the malware or malicious
activity to that one workstation.
(2) Protection is the process of segmenting the ICS systems from other systems to
prevent compromise to the ICS system, prevent exfiltration of data, and to sever
command and control by outside actors. For example, if the SCADA network were
compromised, the ICS network and the removal of a network cable connecting the
two networks at a firewall, switch, or router could segment the SCADA network. This
would protect the ICS network.
b. In many cases you will want to perform both segmentation and containment, isolating
the infected assets and protecting the ICS process and end devices.
c. All Mitigation steps should be performed with an understanding of the impact the
segmentation will have on operational systems and processes.

Enclosure H: Mitigation Isolation and Protection

H-1

ACI TTP

H.3. Creating a Segmentation Strategy
a. The segmentation strategy is a documented process for understanding how your ICS
assets could be separated during and after a cyber attack. Each ICS environment is
unique, based on protocols, network architecture, physical locations, equipment,
software, and mission priorities.
b. The first step is to identify the commander’s mission priorities. These are the most
critical processes that must remain operational.
c. The second step is to identify critical processes and dependencies. This includes
identifying all of the assets that are required to keep the mission priorities operational.
d. The third step is to review the network architecture to identify logical points where
segmentation could occur to contain infected assets or protect the ICS processes.
e. This document should be maintained with the continuity of operations and baseline
documentation.

H.4. Suggested Segmentation Areas
a. Enclave Segmentation. Enclave segmentation is the separation of accreditation
boundaries. The enclave is a collection of information systems connected by one or
more internal networks under the control of a single authority and a security policy. The
systems may be structured by physical proximity or by function. (CNSSA-4009)
b. Network Segmentation. Information technology segmentation (network segmentation) is
the division of a large network into smaller networks or network segments.
c. Zone and Conduit Segmentation. Industrial Control Systems may be separated based
on zones and conduits. Zone segmentation is the division of industrial systems into
grouped sub-systems for the primary purpose of reducing the attack surface and
minimizing attack vectors. It limits the flow of data between zones. (Knapp, 2015)
(1) Physical zones are defined based on the grouping of assets based on physical
location.
(2) Logical zones are grouped based on a particular functionality or characteristic.
d. ICS Process Segmentation. The ICS process segmentation is designed around an ICS
process like power, water, HVAC, etc. The ICS process segmentation separates one
process from another process.
e. Device Mitigation. The device segmentation is meant to assist operators in isolating an
affected or targeted device that is stand alone, or out-of-band, which does not
communicate with other devices. This is the least intrusive Mitigation action to an ICS
system. This procedure should be used when evidence of an adversarial presence is
identified and limited to a single device.
f. Network Virtual LAN (VLAN). VLANs are created to subdivide a network into virtual
network segments. This architecture provides additional security. When VLANs are
implemented, they provide an additional location for segmentation.
g. Sub-system. The sub-system segmentation is meant to assist operators in isolating a
targeted or affected sub-system or function. The three main segments of an ICS are field
devices, field controllers, and HMIs. These work together for a specific process or

Enclosure H: Mitigation Isolation and Protection

H-2

ACI TTP

function. For example, one sub-system may be used for power, another for water
treatment. The purpose of sub-system Mitigation is to isolate and maintain local control
of a particular function without affecting the remainder of the system.
h. Layer. The ICS layer segmentation is meant to assist operators in isolating a targeted or
affected ICS network within an information system. These Mitigation actions are the
most intrusive and should be undertaken when the incident is rapidly propagating and is
potentially targeting lower layers, or when the ISSM and the operators believe that the
ICS devices and processes at the lower levels are being directly threatened.

ENCLOSURE I: CYBER SEVERITY LEVELS
I.1. Cyber Severity Levels Introduction
a. Description. Cyber Severity Levels are a designation of the extent to which cyber activity
may impact the operational mission or supporting operational requirements.

section AA.15)
(2) Severity Levels
(3) Malicious Actions

I.2. Cyber Severity Levels Overview
While ICS/SCADA can be attacked in a variety of ways, there are a number of steps that are
common, or at least present in most attacks. Each of these steps could yield some behavioral
change in the system that could be detected by an operator. However, not all Detections require
a Mitigation action. Mitigation is a disruptive process, which could degrade the operational
capabilities. Given those circumstances, a more graduated approach to Detection/Mitigation
allows IT and ICS managers to take steps to assess the cyber event to determine what level of
response is required and react proportionately. Table I-1 provides the incident level severity
rating approach used in the ACI TTP.

I.3. Incident Severity Levels
The Severity Level Scale is a range between 3 and 0, from the least severity to the greatest
severity, respectively. Table I-1 provides the ACI TTP definitions as well as the
CJCSM 6510.01B definitions.

APPENDIX A: SUPPORTING MATERIALS
AA.1 System Characterization Guidelines
The baselining guidelines located in enclosure E were designed to assist information technology
(IT) and industrial control system (ICS) managers in characterizing the ICS (also known as
developing a baseline). This baseline should be used as a reference during the execution of the
Detection phase of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).
While executing the Detection phase of the Advanced Cyber Industrial Control System Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures (ACI TTP) during a cyber event, IT and ICS operators can
compare a system’s state to its baseline, and determine whether:
a. A system is connected to the correct assets
b. A system is executing the correct processes
c. A system is allowing the correct users access at the correct permission level during
normal working hours
d. The network traffic is normal
e. The security settings or configuration files have been altered on the system
f. The firmware properties have been altered
These guidelines consist of tables that can be populated as well as instructions for tools that
commonly exist on most systems located in the ICS. Tools are used to generate text files that
contain information about the ICS baseline. These files can either be printed and stored as hard
copies or stored on magnetic media. In either case, the idea is to maintain this information in a
safe and readily available manner.

AA.2 Characterizing ICS (Establishing the Baseline)
Effective Detection of an adversary’s actions requires an understanding of what a system’s
normal operations are. Characterizing the ICS, also known as establishing the baseline, allows
IT and ICS managers to document normal conditions for the ICS, and store these for reference
during the execution of the Detection portion of the TTP. Without such information, Detecting
the activity of an advanced cyber adversary would prove very difficult.
The following artifacts should be included in the ICS baseline:
a. Network architecture diagram
b. Data flows
c. Authorized list of software and hardware
d. Configuration files
e. Firmware values
f. Authorized ports, protocols, and services
g. User accounts with authorized privileges
Guidelines and templates required to characterize the ICS are located in this appendix.

Appendix A: Supporting Material

AA-1

ACI TTP

AA.3 Collaborating with Network Managers and Establishing Restoration Point
The enterprise (or network) perimeter devices, such as firewalls, perimeter routers, demilitarized
zones (DMZ), et cetera, which form (in most cases) the corporate enterprise facing layer of the
ICS, is managed by the command’s information technology (IT) organization.
These devices may or may not be configured to Detect attack signatures that could affect the
ICS (such as inbound/outbound ICS-specific protocols). Therefore, the ICS organization should
engage the command’s IT organization and develop a concept of operations relative to the
network perimeter, and the ICS’ cyber security needs.
In addition to coordinating with the command’s IT organization, the ICS organization should
coordinate with the ISSM, and obtain the command’s notification procedures for cyber events.
If the ICS has undergone any type of Certification and Accreditation (C&A), whether platform IT
(PIT) or a full C&A package, a variety of documents should be available establishing the fully
mission-capable (FMC) baseline.

AA.4 Routers and Switches
While routers are not often located within an ICS network, they are commonly located within
corporate networks, specifically connecting two wide area networks (WANs) or connecting a
WAN to the Internet. However, wireless routers do commonly connect ICS to remote devices or
vendors.
Routers and switches can be configured in a variety of ways. It is important to establish the
FMC baseline of ICS routers and switches. The hash for the router and switches Internetwork
Operating System (IOS) should be captured and stored with the Recovery Jump-Kit. In addition,
the firmware hash, as well as the router and switch configuration file, should be captured and
stored. The IOS should be available on vendor-provided media. If not, the IOS and firmware
should be downloaded from the vendor’s web site, stored onto magnetic media, and writeprotected. The date and time, as well as the versions of the IOS and firmware, should be
logged.

AA.5 Servers and Workstations
There are several servers and workstations commonly located within an ICS. These include
data historians, human-machine interfaces (HMIs), application servers, data base servers, and
engineering workstations. Each of these machines provides a variety of opportunities for
exploitation. It is important to create an International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
image of each machine to be stored in the Recovery Jump-Kit. An ISO image is an archive file
composed of the data contents from every written sector of a device. In addition, the basic input
and output system (BIOS) hash should be captured and stored with the Recovery Jump-Kit.

Appendix A: Supporting Material

AA-2

ACI TTP

AA.6 Network Architecture
The Recovery Jump-Kit should always include the network architecture diagram. This
architecture documents which devices are connected, what external connections exist, and how
these devices are connected. The network architecture should include:
a. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for each device
b. MAC addresses for each device
c. Connection means (e.g., Ethernet, serial connection, etc.)
d. Device names and location
Ideally, the network architecture would be created using a network scanning tool. However, if
such a tool is not available, the network should be mapped by using command line interface
commands and physically “walking the wires,” which refers to a manual process of tracing
connections manually and documenting their location, ports, and connectivity.

AA.7 Data Flow Diagrams
Understanding what information should be flowing through the ICS is a key data point when
attempting to identify malicious actors hiding within the network traffic. A data flow diagram
should be included in the Jump-Kit in order to provide operators with a baseline understanding
of their normal flow of network traffic. While data flows can change with new software releases
and updates, overall, ICS data flows should remain fairly constant and predictable. Data flow
diagrams include: where data is flowing from and where data is flowing to, and documentation
of the ports, protocols, and services.

AA.8 Authorized User List
As with the network architecture and the data flow diagrams, understanding who should be on
the ICS and what they should be permitted to access also provides a baseline picture of how
the ICS should be operating.
If an operator discovers a new account on an ICS asset, and that account is not linked to an
authorized user, or if an authorized user is using his/her account in an abnormal manner, these
may be signs of a malicious actor spoofing a user account. Having a list of authorized users and
what they are permitted to access provides operators with a known, good baseline of authorized
users, and it enables operators to recognize malicious actors who are spoofing accounts.

AA.9 Notifications
Keeping command stakeholders advised of a cyber incident allows all parties to remain vigilant
relative to their own systems. Cyber attacks, particularly those coming from well-funded and
motivated actors, have specific objectives in mind, and are trying to degrade a command’s
capability in order to achieve a larger objective. Providing relevant information about a cyber

ACI TTP

attack up and down the chain of command ensures every potentially affected entity within the
chain of command is informed and ready to defend the network in their area of cognizance.
While the Department of Defense (DoD) maintains overarching notification requirements for
cyber incidences, each service and subordinate command may have unique notification
requirements. ICS operators should become familiar with these requirements and integrate
these into their standard notification procedures.
At a minimum, ICS operators should identify those individuals and organizations that are
responsible for networking infrastructure, cyber security, incident response plans, and
notification requirements.

AA.10 Training Requirements and Recommendations
To enhance the effective use of the ACI TTP, it is recommended that the following training be
completed by anyone who plans to use the ACI TTP:

AA.15 Integration with CJCSM 6510.01B Requirements
a. Mitigation consists of short-term tactical actions to stop an intruder’s access to a
compromised information system, limit the extent of an intrusion, prevent an intruder
from causing further damage, and allow the system to remain in some state of operation.
(1) The primary objectives for the Mitigation procedures are:
(a) Regain control of the information systems involved in order to further analyze the
cyber incident, allow for continued operations, and eventually return the IT to
normal operation.
(b) Deny an intruder access to prevent him or her from continuing the malicious
activity and from affecting other information systems and data.
(2) While an intruder has access to an information system, the information system
cannot be properly analyzed or restored. Performing Mitigation:
(a) Prevents an intruder from accessing or exfiltrating DoD data or other information.
(b) Prevents an intruder from destroying valuable evidence and tampering with
information systems while they are being analyzed.
(c) Prevents an intruder from using DoD information systems to attack other
information systems.
(d) Allows an organization to continue operations in some manner.
(3) Mitigation provides a reasonable security solution until sufficient information is
collected to address the vulnerabilities exploited and the damage sustained.
(a) It should be noted that some Mitigation actions could be taken during the
preliminary response phase of the incident-handling life cycle.
(b) More Mitigation steps may be warranted following in-depth analysis, which may
identify more affected information systems or malicious activities. Mitigation steps
can be executed iteratively with the steps in the Detection and analysis phases.
(4) Mitigation strategies are executed by the organization responsible for the
maintenance and operation of the affected DoD information networks or information
systems. In this organization it could be a local system administrator or could be the
component’s CNDSP. Who executes the strategies will depend on the incident type
and affected component and local policy and procedures.
b. Appendix E of CJCSM 6510.01B (section AA.15 of this TTP) states that one of the
strategies for effectively addressing a cyber incident is that of “Mitigation.”
