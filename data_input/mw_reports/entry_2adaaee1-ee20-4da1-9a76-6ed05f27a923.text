Malware writer is offering for free a malware dubbed Cobian RAT in
the underground, but the malicious code hides an ugly surprise.
In the dark web, it is quite easy to find alone vxers and hacking forums that offer malware
and customize them according to buyers’ needs.
Recently researchers from Zscaler have spotted a remote access trojan dubbed Cobian
remote RAT that was offered for free in the underground. It is fairly elemental malicious code
based on an old RAT known as njRAT, it implements common spying features such as
keylogger, webcam hijacker, screen capturing and of course the ability to execute attackers’
code on the victim’s system.
“The Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team has been monitoring a new remote access Trojan
(RAT) family called Cobian RAT since February 2017. The RAT builder for this family was
first advertised on multiple underground forums where cybercriminals often buy and sell
exploit and malware kits.” reads the analysis from Zscaler. “This RAT builder caught our
attention as it was being offered for free and had lot of similarities to the njRAT/H-Worm
family, which we analyzed in this report.”
Unfortunately, the Cobain RAT hides a malicious feature in an encrypted library, the code
allows the author of the malware to take full control of machines infected with the RAT.

The code could be used by the author also to completely cut off the crooks who initially
infected the machine with the Cobain RAT.
The malware researchers noticed that the backdoor module hidden in the Cobian builder kit
communicates with a preset page on Pastebin that was managed by the original author. In
this way, the malware gets the current address of the command and control servers run by
the original writer, but it first checks for the presence of the second level operator online to
avoid being detected.
The experts speculate the original author’s purpose is to build a massive botnet exploiting
the effort of second operators in spreading the Cobian RAT.
“It is ironic to see that the second level operators, who are using this kit to spread malware
and steal from the end user, are getting duped themselves by the original author. The original
author is essentially using a crowdsourced model for building a mega Botnet that leverages
the second level operators Botnet.” concluded. “The original author is essentially using a
crowdsourced model for building a mega Botnet that leverages the second level operators’
Botnet.”
