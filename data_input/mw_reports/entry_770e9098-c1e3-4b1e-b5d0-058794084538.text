A longstanding cyberespionage campaign has been targeting mainly Japanese
organizations with its own custom-developed malware (Backdoor.Daserf). The group,
known to Symantec as Tick, has maintained a low profile, appearing to be active for at least
10 years prior to discovery.
In its most recent campaign, Tick employed spear-phishing emails and compromised a
number of Japanese websites in order to infect a new wave of victims. The group is highly
selective in its approach and only appears to deploy its full range of tools once it establishes
that the compromised organization is an intended target. Tick also uses a range of
hacktools to map the victim’s network and attempt to escalate privileges further.

Daserf’s main purpose is information stealing and the Trojan is capable of gathering
information from infected computers and relaying it back to attacker-controlled servers.
Tick’s most recent attacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and
broadcasting sectors in Japan.
Recent attacks
Symantec discovered the most recent wave of Tick attacks in July 2015, when the group
compromised three different Japanese websites with a Flash (.swf) exploit to mount
watering hole attacks. Visitors to these websites were infected with a downloader known as
Gofarer (Downloader.Gofarer). Gofarer collects information about the compromised
computer and then downloads and installs Daserf.
Tick also used spear-phishing emails in these recent attacks. While Symantec did not find
the emails themselves, it did identify the use of an exploit designed to take advantage of a
vulnerability in Microsoft Office documents (CVE-2014-4114). This was used to distribute
malware in addition to the watering hole activity.
Tick under the microscope
Daserf appears to be custom-developed for use in Tick’s cyberespionage campaigns. Once
installed, it establishes a remote connection to Tick’s command and control server,
providing the attacker with access to the compromised computer.

Once the malware is installed on a targeted computer, the attackers attempt to enumerate
the network and escalate their privilege level. To do this, Tick uses a number of publicly
available hacktools such as Mimikatz, GSecdump, and Windows Credential Editor. The
tools are downloaded and deployed to the original install directory previously created by the
malware.
Tick’s primary objective appears to be the theft of sensitive information from targeted
Japanese organizations. To date, Symantec has observed the group attempting to steal
emails and documents such as PowerPoint presentations.
Low-profile threat
The Daserf Trojan employs a number of tactics to avoid detection. Once collected, the
stolen data is hidden in password-protected .rar archives.
Daserf also uses file and folder names related to legitimate programs often found in
Windows environments in order to blend in. Observed folder names include HP, Intel,
Adobe, and perflogs and folders are generally created in either the root drive or the
Application Data or Program Files folders. File names used in recent attacks include
adobe.exe, adobe_sl.exe, intel.exe, and intellog.exe.
Command and control servers
Tick uses compromised web servers to distribute malware and, in some instances, for its
command and control (C&C) infrastructure. However, in most cases, it relies on its own
infrastructure for C&C purposes.
In its most recent campaigns, the group registered the domains used for C&C servers days
after the malware was compiled. For example, one of the variants of Daserf used was
compiled on July 8, 2015. This sample was seen contacting the C&C domain
www[.]dreamsig[.]com, which was first registered on July 13, 2015, five days after the
compilation date. This pattern occurred in multiple Daserf samples.
Another interesting aspect of the communication between the malware and the C&C
infrastructure is how the malware changes the URL from a randomly chosen variable
selected from a predefined list.

Symantec identified multiple C&C domains used by Tick. Unfortunately, Tick frequently used
either privacy protection services or domain brokers to mask registration information. These
tactics are used to make discovery and attribution more difficult.

Stolen digital certificates used in selected cases
The majority of the malware analyzed was not digitally signed. However, a small percentage
was signed with a stolen digital certificate. It is unclear why the certificate was used so
sparingly, since signed malware would receive a greater level of trust and reduce the risk of
detection.
It is possible that the certificate was used against a target that had a secure environment
which may have required binaries to be signed in order to interact with the operating
system.
The issuer of the certificate has been informed of its misuse and confirmed that it would be
revoked.

Targets
The use of compromised websites to infect victims results in unintentional infections,
making it difficult to identify the motives of the attacker. By searching for evidence of postinfection activity, Symantec identified seven organizations where Tick had mounted
persistent post-compromise attacks. These organizations were primarily large Japanese
technology, engineering, and media firms.

5/7

Figure 3. Daserf infections by region
The seven organizations therefore appear to be Tick’s intended targets. In addition to
seeing post-compromise tools used in these attacks, the length of time the attackers were
active on the networks provided additional evidence that these were high-value targets. The
longest time Tick was active in a victim’s environment was 18 months. The average
timeframe was five months and the number of infected hosts in a victim’s network ranged
from 3 to 15 systems.
Conclusion
Tick has left a trail of evidence indicating that its activity began as early as 2006. In earlier
attacks, the group used malicious Microsoft Word documents to infect victims, with
compromised websites being added to the mix as a more recent attack vector.
Tick appears to be a well-organized group, with the funding and capability to develop and
update its malware. It has the ability to compromise legitimate infrastructure to use for
malware distribution and has access to stolen digital certificates to sign its malware when
needed. Tick primarily uses purchased infrastructure for its C&C servers and has been able
to stay off the radar since 2006.
Tick exhibits all the hallmarks of an advanced cyberespionage group. The long lifespan of
the group, as well as the consistent targeted attacks against specific industries, support this
theory. The individuals or organization behind Tick’s operations has an interest in Japanese
technology along with Japanese media and broadcasting organizations. While Tick’s tactics
may change over time, the group’s history indicates that its focus will continue to be a
narrow range of targets, mainly in Japan.
