Ursnif is a variant of the Gozi malware family has recently been responsible for a growing
campaign targeting various entities across North America and Europe. The campaign looks
to have started around the 6th of April via a number of domains taking up residence at
8.208.90.28.

1/11

Overall 16 domains have been pointed to the IP since the start of the campaign.

As of 04/22 these actors have moved their campaign to a new IP: 47.241.106.208

Initial Access:
The particular point of interest in this campaign is the effectiveness of the TTP’s at bypassing
many security tools. In the delivery stage the campaign uses compromised email accounts to
inject into previous conversations by adding a link and imploring the recipient to check the
2/11

latest update to the ongoing conversation.

The link provided is to a Google Drive account, a trusted entity to users, and often not
capable of being blocked in many enterprises. The Google Drive link downloads a password
protected zip file with a javascript (JS) file inside.

Execution:
Upon execution, the JS file will be executed by wscript. Wscript then gives way to Regsrv32
which loads a txt file into memory. The txt file however is actually a DLL file that once loaded
into memory runs under the regsrv32 process.

3/11

The use of these infection methods were able to bypass several security layers including
Windows Defender at the time of run but we witnessed it detect the txt DLL and eat the file
on disk while missing the running executable running in memory.

4/11

While several infections witnessed during the campaign never moved past beaconing to the
Ursnif C2 at 8.208.90.28 with the DLL in memory, some samples proceeded further.

Persistence:
For those samples the following behavior occurred.

5/11

In the registry location seen referenced below, there could be found more modules for the
malware to call upon.

Command and Control:

6/11

Initial C2 picked up on the following alerts:
ETPRO_TROJAN_Ursnif_Variant_CnC_Beacon_12_M2 8.208.90.28
ETPRO_TROJAN_Ursnif_Variant_CnC_Beacon_12_M1 8.208.90.28

With the TorClient Registry Binary being confirm for its namesake after some time:
ET_P2P_Tor_Get_Server_Request

After around a 24 hour time passage, Ursnif received new activity with alerts triggering for a
VNC module and a new C2 IP.
ETPRO_TROJAN_Possible_Ursnif_VNC_Module_CnC_Beacon 162.244.35.233

This then followed with a flurry of new malware dropped to the system. These turned out to
include both Cobalt Strike beacons as well as TVRat (Team Viewer RAT).
Cobalt Strike was delivered in the form of 3 dll’s loaded into memory again with the help of
run32dll.

Meanwhile TVrat uses the “legitimate” access tool Teamviewer to provide remote access to
the attacker.

1.exe 497129b7b2a940a812b9f3cf3d1a149d903a4179fc75adaf085e4edba533a7c9

This exe reaches out to many of the various teamviewer infrastructure:

At this point the Cobalt Strike and TVrat C2 overtook all previous communications.

ETPRO_TROJAN_Cobalt_Strike_Beacon_Observed 23.81.246.22
ETPRO_TROJAN_Cobalt_Strike_Beacon_Observed 93.190.138.35
ET_TROJAN_Win32.Spy/TVRat_Checkin 89.39.107.106

Action on Objectives:
This continued for some time but we did not witness final actions on objectives from the
actors.
8/11

Conclusion:
Based on the actors capability to bypass security controls and the pivot to new IP
infrastructure we expect this campaign to continue for some time. We recommend paying
close attention to AV alerts tied to files that you wouldn’t normally expect AV alerts (like text
files). And make sure your network signatures are up to date and monitored as these threats
tend to use default or known configurations that are quite noisy if someone is listening.
