Data leaks have always been a concern for organizations. The exposure of sensitive
information can result in damage to reputation, legal penalties, loss of intellectual property,
and even impact the privacy of employees and customers. However, there is little research
about the challenges posed to industrial organizations when threat actors disclose sensitive
details about their OT security, production, operations, or technology.
In 2021, Mandiant Threat Intelligence continued observing ransomware operators attempting
to extort thousands of victims by disclosing terabytes of stolen information on shaming sites.
This trend, which we refer to as “Multifaceted Extortion,” impacted over 1,300 organizations
from critical infrastructure and industrial production sectors in just one year.
To validate the extent to which multifaceted extortion leaks represent a risk to OT, Mandiant
analyzed a semi-random selection of samples from industries that typically leverage OT
systems for production. Using various technical and human resources, we downloaded and
parsed through many terabytes of dump data and found a substantial amount of sensitive OT
documentation. This included network and engineering diagrams, images of operator panels,
information on third-party services, and more. We note that our analysis of each dump was
limited due to the scale of our dataset and that a more targeted examination of a handful of
dumps would probably uncover more documentation per organization.
Based on our analysis, one out of every seven leaks from industrial organizations posted in
ransomware extortion sites is likely to expose sensitive OT documentation. Access to this
type of data can enable threat actors to learn about an industrial environment, identify paths
of least resistance, and engineer cyber physical attacks. On top of this, other data also
included in the leaks about employees, processes, projects, etc. can provide an actor with a
very accurate picture of the target’s culture, plans, and operations.

Mandiant Found a Range of Sensitive OT Documents on Extortion
Sites
In early 2020, Mandiant observed media claims indicating ransomware leaks exposed
aerospace manufacturing designs and third party technical documentation from an electric
utility. A year later, an actor reshared a 2.3 GB Doppelpaymer extortion leak from a major
Latin American oil and gas organization in an underground forum, claiming it contained OT
information.
We analyzed that leak and found a variety of sensitive data including usernames and
passwords, IP addresses, remote services, asset tags, original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) information, operator panels, network diagrams, etc. All information which a
sophisticated threat actor would be hunting for during reconnaissance or what Mandiant’s
red teamers would employ to identify attack paths in a target OT network.

To better understand the risk these data leaks pose to OT asset owners, we built a large
dataset. Over a couple of months, a small team of analysts and data researchers filtered
through hundreds of leaks, collected, and analyzed samples to find OT documentation. We
identified at least 10 dumps that contained sensitive OT technical data. Due to the volume of
data in many leaks, we performed only superficial analysis of the dumps, however had we
invested additional resources to process our samples further, we would have likely found a
significant amount of additional information.
We note that most threat actors would likely focus their efforts on a smaller number of
organizations due to resource limitations or a preexisting interest in a specific target or
targets. This would allow the actor to focus their resources on finding more information on
each target, which would be essential for any sophisticated attack.

Initial Triage
In 2021, we identified over 3,000 extortion leaks released by ransomware operators. Around
1,300 of these leaks were from organizations in industrial sectors that are likely to use OT
systems, such as energy and water utilities, or manufacturing. We selected and retrieved a
couple hundred of these samples by skimming through readily available file listings or other
indicators of interest such as comments from the actor, or the targets’ subindustry. In many
cases, we were not able to acquire or access data from a leak because of timing or errors in
the shared files; in these cases, we discarded the leak.

Figure 2: Filtered volume of extortion leaks
After initial triage, we collected and manually analyzed approximately 70 leaks using custom
and publicly available tools. We found that one out of every seven leaks contained at least
some useful OT information, while the rest contained data related to employees, finances,
customers, legal documentation, among other things. Mandiant did not further analyze those
files, though we note they remain available to threat actors for other purposes.

Collecting Several Terabytes of Already Filtered Data
Ransomware extortion leaks are mostly shared on a variety of threat actor-operated sites on
the dark web. Although each actor operates differently, advertisements for incoming leaks
are typically posted in hacker forums or on social media. Anyone with access to a Tor
browser can visit the sites and download available dumps.

Downloading a single extortion leak is very simple but collecting multiple samples from
different leaks is quite complex given the enormous volume of available data. The ability to
download each of these leaks depends on multiple factors such as the infrastructure from the
attacker and the downloader, the time during which the data is exposed, the number of users
acquiring the file, and the quality of the file itself.
Acquiring each dump may require multiple hours and sometimes days. The dumps can often
fill entire hard drives or virtual machines. To be able to collect, store, and further analyze
multiple dumps, Mandiant leveraged a custom-built internal collections pipeline. It is likely
that only well-resourced actors would have enough resources to reproduce this approach.

Analyzing the Samples to Find Sensitive Technical Documentation
We leveraged manual and automated file analysis to hunt through the data from interesting
samples. We looked for documents such as network and process diagrams, machine
interfaces, asset inventories, usernames and passwords, and project files. In a few cases we

also examined third-party vendor agreements.
Method #1: File Listing of Manual Analysis
We browsed through file listings to identify keywords that hinted at the existence of OTrelated data. We obtained the file listings in a few ways:
Sometimes actors released a directory or text file listing to advertise the extortion leak.
If there was no file listing available, we attempted to create it ourselves.
For small and medium-sized dumps we used Autopsy, a free publicly available
forensics tool. The tool is also included in Mandiant’s FLARE VM image which is
distributed as open source.
For larger dumps, we used custom-built tools or downloaded the files locally to
build a listing via default tools like rar or 7z.
If we were not able to acquire a listing, we browsed manually through file names.
In some cases, a quick look at the listing and keyword searching was enough to determine if
the dump was suitable for analysis, but in other cases the file naming conventions did not
reveal much information. Another aspect that added a layer of complexity was that the
extortion leaks contained data in various languages.
Method #2: Forensic Analysis with Public and Custom Tools
For small and medium-sized dumps we used Autopsy, which enabled us to analyze relatively
large-sized folders. The tool can parse a file and provide summaries of timestamps, file
types, keywords, and other useful data. We were also able to search for keywords using
regular expressions to find data such as IP addresses or usernames, and to quickly visualize
.jpeg images of existent files.

However, Autopsy struggled to analyze larger dumps. It would require multiple hours to
parse a dump of just a couple gigabytes, yet we had identified leaks that contained terabytes
of data. As a result, we had to build custom tools to visualize and analyze larger amounts of
data. We note that even using custom tooling, we still required significant storage capabilities
and human investment to handle the data.

We Found a Substantial Amount of OT Documentation
Finding sensitive OT documentation across such a large volume of files is not simple, but it is
possible. Our findings included data from organizations across different sectors and regions.
Although each of the leaks contained full information about the victim, we redacted their
names and other proprietary information. We provide some examples of our findings below,
but interested readers can sign up for a Mandiant Threat Intelligence Free account to view a

Sophisticated Threat Actors Can Leverage Data Leaks to Support
Reconnaissance Efforts
Sensitive OT and network documentation exposed in ransomware extortion leaks is readily
available for anyone to download, including security researchers, industry competitors, or
threat actors. As we have highlighted, the most concerning scenario involves well-resourced
actors that have the capability to systematically hunt for data to learn about specific targets.

Historically, espionage campaigns have helped state-sponsored groups to acquire
details about the operations of industrial organizations. This reconnaissance data has
supported different stages of real cyber physical attacks such as the Ukraine power
outages in 2015 and 2016 and the TRITON incident.
Data from extortion leaks may provide sophisticated actors with information on
targets, while limiting their exposure to defenders and cost of operations.
Actors may also select targets based on readily available sensitive data about the
victim’s infrastructure, assets, security flaws, and processes.
Attacks that leverage higher levels of cyber physical reconnaissance data are
likely to result in more significant and precise impacts.
Mandiant has released blogs describing how we use network details and process
documentation to model attack scenarios during OT red teaming engagements.
Actors that have limited resources and capabilities will likely have more limited visibility
into data from large extortion leaks. However, they can still explore dumps learn about
an organization, satisfy their curiosity, or reshare the contents.

Protecting OT Data from Multifaceted Extortion Leaks
Based on our analysis, one out of every seven leaks from industrial organizations posted in
ransomware extortion sites is likely to expose sensitive OT documentation. Access to this
type of data can enable threat actors to learn about an industrial environment, identify paths
of least resistance, and engineer cyber physical attacks. On top of this, other data also
included in the leaks about employees, processes, projects, etc. can provide an actor with a
very accurate picture of the target’s culture, plans, and operations.
Even if the exposed OT data is relatively old, the typical life span of cyber physical systems
ranges from twenty to thirty years, resulting in leaks being relevant for reconnaissance efforts
for decades—much longer than exposed information on IT infrastructure. To prevent and
mitigate the risks presented by exposed OT data, we suggest the following:
Create and enforce robust data handling policies for employees and subcontractors to
ensure that internal documentation is protected. Avoid storing highly sensitive
operational data in less-secure networks.
Place special attention on selecting subcontractors that implement comprehensive
security programs to safeguard operational data.
Victims of ransomware intrusions should assess the value of any leaked data to
determine what compensatory controls can help decrease the risk of further intrusions.
Change any leaked credentials and API keys. Consider changing exposed IP
addresses for critical systems and OT jump servers.
Periodically conduct red team exercises to identify externally exposed and insecure
internal information.
Mandiant offers a suite of service options, including OT red teaming, to help OT
asset owners mitigate risk or respond to incidents after they occur.
