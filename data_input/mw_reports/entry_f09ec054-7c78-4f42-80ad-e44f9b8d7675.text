Summary & Key Findings
We identified nine Bahraini activists whose iPhones were successfully hacked with
NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware between June 2020 and February 2021. Some of the
activists were hacked using two zero-click iMessage exploits: the 2020 KISMET exploit
and a 2021 exploit that we call FORCEDENTRY.
The hacked activists included three members of Waad (a secular Bahraini political
society), three members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, two exiled Bahraini
dissidents, and one member of Al Wefaq (a Shiite Bahraini political society).
At least four of the activists were hacked by LULU, a Pegasus operator that we
attribute with high confidence to the government of Bahrain, a well-known abuser of
spyware. One of the activists was hacked in 2020 several hours after they revealed
during an interview that their phone was hacked with Pegasus in 2019.
Two of the hacked activists now reside in London, and at least one was in London
when they were hacked. In our research, we have only ever seen the Bahrain
government spying in Bahrain and Qatar using Pegasus; never in Europe. Thus, the
Bahraini activist in London may have been hacked by a Pegasus operator associated
with a different government.
We shared a list of the targeted phone numbers we identified with Forbidden Stories.
They confirmed that numbers associated with five of the hacked devices were
contained on the Pegasus Project’s list of potential targets of NSO Group’s customers,
data that Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International describe as dating from 2016 up
to several years ago.

1. Human Rights in Bahrain: A History of Brutal Repression
Bahrain is a constitutional monarchy on paper, though in practice, all key power is
concentrated in the hands of the ruling Al-Khalifa family. Bahrain’s legislature consists
of an upper house (Shura Council) appointed by the king, and a lower house (National
Assembly) elected from districts of unequal population, drawn to ensure the opposition
cannot attain a majority. Bahrain has a long history of political movements seeking
greater democratic political reform. More details.
Bahrain has a history of brutal repression of dissent. After King Hamad came to power
as Emir in 1999, the political and human rights situation briefly improved. The king
allowed the formation of civil society organizations, including human rights groups,
independent newspapers, and political parties. However, these reforms were gradually
undone, and by 2010, Bahrain had reverted to its long pattern of arrests, torture, and
aggressive silencing of political opposition. Little vestige of Bahraini civil society
remains today. More details.
Bahrain employs a number of methods to block or suppress Internet content. Bahrain’s
government implements Internet censorship using website-blocking technology from a
Canadian company, Netsweeper, and also employs targeted Internet disruptions in
order to stymie protests. Bahrainis who have posted critical content online have been
pursued by the Ministry of Interior’s Cyber Crime Unit and arrested. More details.
Bahrain surveils human rights activists, dissidents, and members of the political
opposition. The government increasingly uses Internet controls and spyware, targeting
individuals inside Bahrain and outside the country. Since 2010, Bahrain has purchased
spyware from FinFisher, Hacking Team, and NSO Group. More details.

2. Pegasus Hacking of Bahraini Activists
The government of Bahrain appears to have purchased NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware in
2017. Our Hide and Seek report identified a Pegasus operator spying entirely in Bahrain and
Qatar that we referred to as PEARL, which had been active since July 2017.
We observed a massive global spike in Pegasus activity in July 2020, and began conducting
research in a number of country contexts, including Bahrain. We hunted for Pegasus in
Bahrain by instructing targets to forward us their phone logs for analysis, and by setting up
VPNs for key targets to monitor their Internet traffic. We analyzed the phone logs using our
forensic process, and found that nine devices belonging to nine Bahraini activists had been
hacked. In three cases, our forensic analysis concluded that the phones were hacked, but
we were unable to establish an approximate date of the hacking. Analysis is ongoing in these
cases to see if a more precise date can be identified. In the remaining six cases, our analysis
established some precise dates when Pegasus was active on the phones.
The two targets we identified in London consented to be named, though all of the targets in
Bahrain wished to be referred to by their affiliations only.

Bahraini Targets
This section describes the Bahraini targets hacked with Pegasus that we identified.
Waad

4/28

Three targets are members of Waad, a center-left secular political society in Bahrain.
Political parties are illegal in Bahrain, but “political societies,” which perform many of the
functions of political parties, have been allowed since 2001.

Figure 1: The logo of Bahrain’s Waad political society.
The Bahraini government banned Waad and seized its assets amidst a wave of repression in
early 2017. The government claimed that Waad had “support[ed] terrorism and sanction[ed]
violence,” despite the fact that Waad has never used violence, and has always committed
itself to peaceful methods. Before it was banned, Waad’s headquarters was twice subjected
to arson, and was defaced by pro-government protesters in 2011 who wrote “Down with Iran”
and slogans against Bahrain’s Shia muslims.
Bahrain Center for Human Rights
Three targets are members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, a Bahraini NGO formed
in 2002, and banned since 2004, when the Center’s then-President blamed Bahrain’s Prime
Minister for failing to address citizens’ economic concerns. Nevertheless, the organization
has continued to operate without government approval, and was awarded the 2013 Rafto
Prize.

Figure 2: The logo of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.
Al Wefaq
One target is a member of Al Wefaq, Bahrain’s largest opposition political society. All of the
Al Wefaq members of Bahrain’s National Assembly resigned en masse in 2011 in protest of
the government’s violent repression of peaceful protesters. A Bahrain-based news channel
Al-Arab was shut down less than 24 hours after it was launched in February 2015 because
the channel aired an interview with the Secretary General of Al Wefaq. In July 2016, the
Bahraini government dissolved Al Wefaq and seized its assets. Also in 2016, the Bahraini
government revoked the citizenship of Al Wefaq’s de-facto spiritual leader Sheikh Isa
Qassim, a Bahraini by birth.

5/28

Figure 3: The logo of Bahrain’s Al-Wefaq political society.
The Bahrain government has clumsily attempted to link Al Wefaq to terrorism and violence
for a number of years. During the height of the protests in Bahrain in 2011, state television
aired a forced confession read by a detainee who had earlier died under torture. In the forced
confession, the detainee said that Matar Matar, a moderate member of Al Wefaq, had
ordered him to murder policemen. Matar had earlier called for the establishment of a secular
democracy in Bahrain, and had condemned the arrest of doctors that had treated protesters.
London Targets
Two of the targets, Moosa Abd-Ali and Yusuf Al-Jamri, are Bahrainis currently living in exile
in London.

6/28

Figure 4: Bahraini blogger Yusuf Al-Jamri.
Al-Jamri was granted asylum by the UK Home Office in 2018, based on his reports that he
was tortured in 2017 while in the custody of Bahrain’s main intelligence agency, the National
Security Apparatus (‫)ﺟﻬﺎز اﻷﻣﻦ اﻟﻮﻃﻨﻲ‬. Bahrain’s National Security Apparatus (NSA) is
infamous for torturing to death journalist Karim Fakhrawi in 2011, according to the findings of
an independent inquiry (para. 877) that Bahrain’s king ordered under international pressure.
After recommendations from the same commission of inquiry, Bahrain’s king in 2012 revoked
the NSA’s law enforcement powers, though he restored these powers in a January 2017
Royal Decree. A Royal Decree in 2020 changed the name of the NSA to the National
Intelligence Service (‫)ﺟﻬﺎز اﻟﻤﺨﺎﺑﺮات اﻟﻮﻃﻨﻲ‬.
Al-Jamri’s iPhone 7 appears to have been hacked with Pegasus at some point prior to
September 2019. We were unable to determine whether he was hacked while in Bahrain or
London. Further forensic analysis may be able to establish a more precise date of hacking.

7/28

Figure 5: Bahraini activist Moosa Abd-Ali protesting in front of the Bahraini Embassy in
London.
Moosa Abd-Ali is a Bahraini activist living in exile in London. He sued FinFisher, another
spyware company, for supplying the Bahraini government with spyware that was used to
hack his personal computer in 2011. The spying against Moosa’s computer was first revealed
in data leaked from FinFisher. Abd-Ali’s iPhone 8 appears to have been hacked with
Pegasus at some point prior to September 2020. Further forensic analysis may be able to
establish a more precise date of the hacking.

LULU: A Bahrain Government Operator
We attributed the hacking of Activists A-D (three members of Waad, and one member of
BCHR) to a Bahrain government operator of Pegasus that we call LULU. Like PEARL,
LULU appeared to be spying exclusively in Bahrain and Qatar. The LULU operator may in
fact be the same operator as PEARL, which we identified in 2017 and 2018. While we did
not identify any IP addresses or domain names in common between LULU and PEARL, we
would not necessarily expect to identify any infrastructure in common, as NSO Group
registered servers with new domain names and new IP addresses for all its clients following
2018 reports by Citizen Lab and Amnesty Tech. We have never observed more than one
Bahrain government operator active at a time.

8/28

The Pegasus spyware installed on the phones of Activists A-D used four IP addresses for
command-and-control. Each IP address returned a TLS certificate for hooklevel[.]com,
though no DNS lookups were performed for this domain, and the spyware’s TLS Client Hello
message did not contain an SNI. The infection server used was
*.api1r3f4.redirectweburl[.]com.

Table 1: Servers that LULU used to spy on Bahraini activists.
Our forensic analysis has not yet established which Pegasus operator hacked the remaining
five devices. Because we have never observed the Bahrain government successfully hack a
target outside of Bahrain or Qatar with Pegasus, we suspect that Moosa Abd-Ali was hacked
by a second Pegasus operator. That a foreign government may have been responsible for
the hacking does not preclude the possibility that the ultimate recipient of the hacked data
was the Bahraini government.

Mechanisms of Hacking
This section provides a high-level overview of the mechanisms by which the Bahraini targets
were hacked. This section involves synthesis of data from multiple phones, including phones
belonging to non-Bahraini targets.
July – September 2020: KISMET iMessage Zero-Click
When the KISMET exploit was being fired at one of the devices running iOS 13.5.1, the log
showed crashes associated with IMTranscoderAgent, which is responsible for transcoding
and previewing images in iMessages. Specifically, the crashes were segfaults in the
com.apple.IMTranscoderPreviewGenerationQueue thread while apparently parsing ICC color
profile data in a JPEG image received via iMessage. Unfortunately, we were only able to
locate crash summaries with abbreviated stack traces in the system logs.

9/28

Figure 6: A symbolicated crash summary for KISMET on an iPhone Xs running iOS 13.5.1.
After the crashes, IMTranscoderAgent then invoked WebKit to download and render items
from the Pegasus infection server. The rendering triggered a memory pressure warning in
JavaScriptCore, and also triggered a Metal shader compilation.
We believe that KISMET was used as a zero-day exploit against at least iOS 13.5.1 and
13.7.
September 2020: Back to One-Click Exploits
Shortly after Activist B upgraded to iOS 14 in September 2020, they received an SMS link
to Pegasus from “MailExpress,” indicating that the KISMET exploit was not supported on iOS
14.

Figure 7: Pegasus SMS message that Activist B received in September 2020 after updating
to iOS 14.
The message was a fake DHL package tracking notification. The target may have
accidentally previewed the link in the message while attempting to copy the message to send
it to us. The target’s VPN recorded that the link in the message was opened, and redirected
to a unique subdomain of api1r3f4.redirectweburl[.]com, confirming that it was a Pegasus link

10/28

connected to the Bahraini government operator of Pegasus, LULU. This action did not result
in the infection of the phone; it is possible that the target closed the preview before the
exploit ran.
NSO Group may have temporarily switched back to one-click iOS exploits due to the new
BlastDoor security feature implemented by Apple. The BlastDoor feature was designed to
make zero-click exploitation via iMessage harder.
February – July 2021: FORCEDENTRY iMessage Zero-Click
Starting in February 2021, we began to observe NSO Group deploying a new zero-click
iMessage exploit that circumvented Apple’s BlastDoor feature. We refer to the exploit as
FORCEDENTRY, because of its ability to circumvent BlastDoor. Amnesty Tech also
observed zero-click iMessage exploitation activity around the same time, and referred to the
activity they observed as “Megalodon.” We confirmed with Amnesty Tech that the
“Megalodon” activity they observed matches the characteristics of the FORCEDENTRY
exploit that we observed.
When the FORCEDENTRY exploit was being fired at a device, the device logs showed
crashes associated with IMTranscoderAgent. The crashes appeared to be segfaults
generated by invoking the copyGifFromPath:toDestinationPath:error function on files
received via iMessage.
The crashes appeared to be of two types. Type one crashes indicate that the chain of events
set off by invoking copyGifFromPath:toDestinationPath:error ultimately crashed while
apparently invoking ImageIO’s functionality for rendering Adobe Photoshop PSD data.

Figure 8: A Symbolicated Type One crash for FORCEDENTRY on an iPhone 12 Pro Max
running iOS 14.6.
Type two crashes indicate that the chain of events set off by invoking
copyGifFromPath:toDestinationPath:error ultimately crashed while invoking CoreGraphics’
functionality for decoding JBIG2-encoded data in a PDF file.

11/28

Figure 9: A Symbolicated Type Two crash for FORCEDENTRY on an iPhone 12 Pro Max
running iOS 14.6.
After the IMTranscoderAgent crashes, we noticed that the Apple thermal monitoring daemon,
thermalmonitord, returned a series of errors:
Exception caught during decoding of reply to message ‘propertiesOfPath:handler:’, dropping
incoming message and calling failure block.
Then, thermalmonitord invoked the tailspin process three times. The tailspin process caused
two segfaults, but we ultimately found an invocation of tailspin running alongside the
spyware:
/usr/bin/tailspin test-symbolicate 1234567
Phone logs indicated that the “responsible process” for the spyware was amfid, the Apple
mobile file integrity daemon.
We saw the FORCEDENTRY exploit successfully deployed against iOS versions 14.4 and
14.6 as a zero-day.
With the consent of targets, we shared these crash logs and some additional phone logs
relating to KISMET and FORCEDENTRY with Apple, Inc., which confirmed they were
investigating.

3. Hacked Again after Going Public
Activist D, a member of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, was additionally targeted with
Pegasus in March 2019 with a Pegasus SMS message from “BatelcoEsvc.” Activist D
discussed the 2019 incident in a 2020 interview in which Activist D was interviewed
alongside one of the authors of this report. The Bahraini goverment’s LULU operator hacked
Activist D with Pegasus using the KISMET zero-click exploit approximately six hours after
the interview first aired. This case highlights the risks inherent in going public with instances
of hacking.

12/28

The 2019 Pegasus SMS appeared in a thread with legitimate messages from Activist D’s
mobile provider, Batelco. The target was curious about the message, and contacted Batelco,
who told them that the message was not of a type sent by Batelco.

13/28

Figure 10: The malicious text (bottom) and legitimate texts from Batelco (above). The text is
unusual because it (1) is in Arabic, (2) contains a link, and (3) does not begin with “Dear
Customer.”
The link unshortens to a website on info-update[.]org, which redirected to the legitimate
Batelco e-services website (https://e.batelco.com/eservices/Login) when submitted to
VirusTotal. When we checked it, the link returned a 404.
The info-update[.]org website is connected to the Pegasus spyware, as we show below.

Decoy Page Reveals 2019 Pegasus Sites
NSO Group has occasionally made use of visible decoy pages, perhaps in an effort to make
their Pegasus infrastructure appear as innocuous servers. We found an interesting server,
start-anew[.]net, which displayed an open directory listing that contained a decoy page.

Figure 11: How start-anew[.]net looked in a web browser.The directory contained a file, 1,
which contained HTML source code for a website maintenance decoy page. The page was
entitled “While maintenance:” and contained the text “Working hard to create a new website
design. Stay in touch!”

14/28

Figure 12: How the decoy page (1) looks in a browser.
The title “While maintenance:” and the text “Working hard to create a new website design.
Stay in touch!” exactly matched pages returned by two Pegasus servers that matched a
fingerprint we used in our Hide and Seek report. These two servers were part of a group of
Pegasus servers that were spun up in 2018 after Amnesty Tech and Citizen Lab published
reports about the targeting of an Amnesty International staffer with Pegasus, but before
Citizen Lab’s Hide and Seek report.

helpusfind[.]biz

Scanning Shared Web Hosters
We noted that these three domains were hosted on shared web hosting providers. In other
words, the IP addresses that they pointed to had dozens of other innocuous domains also
pointing to them. In previous iterations of NSO Group’s Pegasus infrastructure, each domain
name pointed to a separate IP address.
Scanning websites on shared web hosting required us to adjust our scanning infrastructure
to use domain names rather than IP addresses. The usage of shared hosting providers
appears to have begun after we published our Hide and Seek report in September 2018. We
disclose our fingerprinting and scanning pipeline below, because it is no longer capable of
detecting Pegasus servers.

Our scan results comprise 175 domain names, and included the domain name infoupdate[.]org from the SMS sent to Activist D. Our scan results also include one domain
name that appears to be directly related to human rights (human-rights-news[.]com), as well
as domain names that indicate potential targeting in the USA (washington-today[.]com,
breakingnewyork[.]info), as well as apparent targeting in relation to the Bahraini elections (ielection-online[.]com).
We also found several interesting websites linked to Azerbaijan, including
siyasimehbus[.]com (“political prisoners”) and mitinq23fevral[.]info, which is a reference to
“Rally 23rd February,” a protest planned by the opposition Popular Front Party on February
23, 2019. The protest was not authorized by authorities.

4. Historical Context
Bahrain: One Monarchy, Two Constitutions
The Kingdom of Bahrain is an archipelago situated off the east coast of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia. From the sixteenth century until the nineteenth century, Bahrain was occupied
by a succession of ruling powers, until Sheikh Ahmed Bin Mohammed Al Khalifa (known in
Bahrain as “Ahmed the Conqueror”) seized control of Bahrain in 1783. The rule of the Al
Khalifa family has persisted until the present day, despite numerous internal and external
challenges to their authority, including during the period from 1820 to 1971 when Bahrain
was a British protectorate under the General Maritime Treaty of 1820.

16/28

Bahrain declared independence from Britain on August 15, 1971, after the withdrawal of
British troops. Six months later, Bahrain’s then-Emir, Sheikh Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa,
decreed that a constituent assembly would draft a new constitution. In 1973, the assembly
issued their constitution, which provided for an elected unicameral parliament with an
advisory, rather than legislative role. However, after Bahrain’s first parliament saw a
contentious debate on a state security decree, the Emir dissolved the parliament in 1975,
and suspended the Constitution.
Between 1975 and 2001, the Bahraini government engaged in numerous forms of
repression. Human Rights Watch described abuses in the country during this time as “wideranging” and covering a broad spectrum of offences, including arbitrary detention, the
psychological abuse of detainees, and the “broad denial of fundamental political and civil
liberties.”

Figure 13: A billboard along a major highway put up by an advertising company salutes
Bahrain’s King Hamad as “King of Glory.” (Author: Bill Marczak)
Sheikh Isa was succeeded by his son Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa in 1999. Sheikh
Hamad’s rule began with reform measures including the release of political prisoners. Sheikh
Hamad also appointed a committee to draft a “National Action Charter” to address political
17/28

grievances. On February 14, 2001, Bahrainis approved the Charter with 98.4% of the vote.
The next year, Sheikh Hamad declared Bahrain a Kingdom and promulgated a new
constitution that broke one of the Charter’s key vows. While the Charter called for a
bicameral parliament with sole legislative power vested in an elected lower house, Bahrain’s
2002 constitution allowed the parliament’s appointed upper house to exercise a de-facto veto
over legislation passed by the lower house. As a result, several political societies in Bahrain
boycotted the first elections under the new constitution in 2002.
Additionally, electoral districts for the parliament’s lower house were drawn to be of unequal
sizes, in order to diminish the opposition’s political power. For example, in Bahrain’s 2012
parliamentary elections, the voting power of an individual in a pro-government district was
roughly 21 times the voting power of an individual in an opposition stronghold.

A Brutal History of Repression
Since 1938, organized political movements have demanded greater popular representation
in Bahrain. However, the government has responded with repression and violence that
continues to the present day. Bahrain saw a brief period of improvement in human rights
following Sheikh Hamad’s reforms, though as is often the case in Bahrain, perceived
challenges to the monarchy led to the rollback of reforms.
In 2010, prior to the Arab Spring, the Haq Movement, the Islamic Wafa Movement, and the
Bahrain Freedom Movement called for a boycott of parliamentary elections that were
scheduled to take place on October 23, 2010. In response, immediately before the elections,
the government cracked down on opposition activists.

18/28

Figure 14: Protesters began to gather at Pearl Roundabout on February 15, 2011. (Author:

As part of the Arab Spring uprising, Bahrainis took to the streets on the tenth anniversary of
the National Action Charter’s approval (February 14, 2011) demanding democratic political
reform, freedom, justice, and equal distribution of wealth and power. The pace of protests
increased as security forces targeted and killed protesters.

Figure 15: A montage of two stills from a state television broadcast show Saudi troops
cheering and saluting television cameras as a convoy of armored vehicles rolls into Bahrain

to suppress protests.
Drawing inspiration from Egypt’s Tahrir Square, Bahraini demonstrators quickly occupied the
Pearl Roundabout, a major traffic circle located that contained a towering monument of six
sails holding up a giant pearl. The pearl monument quickly became an opposition symbol.
On March 18, 2011, Bahraini forces, backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, forcibly evicted the protesters. Security forces arrested and tortured hundreds
of Bahrainis. The government also began a campaign to expunge the Pearl Roundabout and
its symbolic monument from Bahrain. The government demolished the monument, paved
over the roundabout, and even recalled coinage featuring the monument.

Figure 16: After the demolition of the pearl monument, authorities converted the Pearl
Roundabout into a traffic junction. (Author: nbdbahrain2@gmail.com; Licensed under CC-BYSA 3.0).
Under international pressure following the killings of dozens of protesters and detainees by
security forces, Bahrain’s king formed the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry to
investigate the events of February to March 2011. The Commission’s report, issued on
November 23, 2011, concluded that the authorities were responsible for “grave violations of
human rights, including the arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, and arbitrary detention.”

20/28

Figure 17: A 2011 political billboard against the Bahraini protests says: “We request of the
government.. The ultimate punishment. NO PARDON.. For the leaders of the sedition (fitna)
and the deviant group.”
In 2016, the Bahraini authorities expanded their efforts to ban and dismantle opposition
movements. The government dissolved Al-Wefaq and jailed its leader Ali Salman for life. The
government also stripped the citizenship of Sheikh Isa Qassim, a natural born Bahraini and
prominent Shia cleric regarded as the spiritual leader of Al-Wefaq. Bahrain stepped up
repression measures in 2017. The government reinstituted the death penalty and authorities
continued to employ arbitrary revocation of citizenship as a new means of repression.
Hundreds of activists were stripped of their citizenship and remain stateless.
In March 2017, the Bahraini Justice Ministry dissolved and then charged Waad with
“advocating violence, supporting terrorism and incitement to encourage crimes and
lawlessness” after the political group issued a statement on the anniversary of the 2011
uprising saying that Bahrain was suffering from a “constitutional political crisis.” This event
was followed by the permanent suspension of Al Wasat newspaper in June 2017. At the
time, Al Wasat was Bahrain’s only independent newspaper, and had been briefly suspended
several times since its inception in 2002.

21/28

Figure 18: Al Wasat’s sign is removed from its headquarters following the permanent
suspension of the newspaper by authorities in 2017.
Recent events suggest that the government of Bahrain will continue its repressive policies.
Under the pretext of addressing COVID-19, the Bahraini government has imposed further
restrictions on freedom of expression. Further, while Bahrain released a number of prisoners
in March 2020 due to COVID-19, authorities excluded political prisoners from that release.

Bahrain’s Internet Censorship
Freedom of expression is enshrined in Articles 23, 24, and 26 of the 2002 Bahraini
Constitution. Despite this veneer of legal protection, Bahrain ranks 168 out of 180 countries
on the 2021 World Press Freedom Index. The Bahraini government maintains tight control
over the Internet by requiring all websites hosted in Bahrain to be registered with the
Information Affairs Authority (IAA). The government imposes strict filtering policies.
One of the first instances of website censorship in Bahrain was the 2002 blocking of popular
online forum BahrainOnline.org. The website, which was hosted outside of Bahrain, was
central in facilitating public debate and discussion critical of the Bahraini government, from
planning for the February 2011 protests to sharing videos and photos of human rights
violations and protests.

22/28

Figure 19: A 2005 screenshot from the OpenNet Initiative demonstrates censorship of
BahrainOnline.org.
Bahrain formalized its Internet censorship regulations in 2009, when the Ministry of Culture
and Information issued a resolution requiring all ISPs to install website blocking software
chosen by the Ministry, and to comply with requests from the Ministry to block specific
websites. The websites of political opposition, human rights organizations, and online
newspapers were blocked in 2009. The same policies have been applied to social media
platforms. In late 2010, the authorities blocked the Facebook page of Abdul Wahab Hussien,
a Bahraini opposition leader.

After the uprising in 2011, the Bahraini authorities expanded Internet controls in the country
by targeting political and religious and human rights content. Websites, live-streaming
platforms, and some social media sites were censored.
In 2013, the Citizen Lab documented the presence of censorship and surveillance
technology (namely, ProxySG devices and PacketShaper devices) produced by Blue Coat
Systems in Bahrain. In 2016, the Citizen Lab reported that Internet-filtering technology
produced by Netsweeper, Inc. was present on the networks of nine Bahrain-based ISPs.

Testing on the ISP Batelco showed that at least one of these Netsweeper installations was
being used to filter political content, including content related to human rights, opposition
political websites, Shiite websites, and local and regional news sources.

located inside Bahrain, between the hours of 7:00PM and 1:00AM every night during a
protest in the village of Duraz.
Also in 2016, a nightly Internet disruption was reported in the Bahraini village of Duraz. The
disruption coincided with peaceful nightly protests outside the house of Al Wefaq’s de-facto
spiritual leader, Isa Qassim, that started when the Bahraini government revoked his
citizenship. An investigation by Bahrain Watch found that both landline and mobile Internet
services were disrupted. Landline connections were disrupted by artificially introducing
astronomical latency and packet loss between specific hours (Figure 21) on IP addresses
assigned to subscribers in Duraz. During the same hours, all data services on cell towers
serving Duraz were disabled. Outside of the disrupted hours, the Internet in Duraz appeared
to function normally.
As of 2020, Bahrain continues to be categorized as “Not Free” by Freedom House. In its
most recent Freedom on the Net report, Freedom House states “numerous websites
continued to be blocked, social media users were continuously interrogated at the security
department and were pressured to remove content, and citizens were arrested and jailed for
content posted online,” among other developments.

Surveillance of Bahraini Dissidents
In addition to the authorities expanding Internet controls in Bahrain, there have been
numerous reports regarding Bahrain’s use of surveillance technology against human rights
activists, dissidents, and members of the political opposition, domestically and

transnationally.
In 2011, Bloomberg reported that Trovicor GmbH (previously related to Nokia Siemens
Networks) sold interception equipment to Bahrain, which the authorities then used to spy on
dissidents’ communications. One such target was Abdul Ghani Al Khanjar, a Bahraini
activist, who publicly described how he was confronted with transcripts of his SMS text
messages while being detained and tortured by the authorities between August 2010 and
February 2011. The transcripts of Al Khanjar’s text messages were reportedly obtained from
Trovicor’s system.

Figure 22: Emails like this one were sent to Bahraini activists. The attachments contained
FinFisher spyware that sent information back to the Bahraini government.
In 2012, the Citizen Lab released a report describing the targeting of Bahraini activists and
human rights defenders, using surveillance malware from a UK-German company, FinFisher.
A subsequent leak of files from FinFisher indicated that the Bahraini government used
FinFisher’s spyware to spy on large swathes of the opposition at home and abroad. A leaked
target list showed that the computer of a prominent Bahraini lawyer was hacked on the same
day as a blackmail attempt against him. The lawyer received a CD containing instructions
that the lawyer should stop defending activists, otherwise a video included on the CD would
be publicized. The lawyer viewed the CD on his computer, and found that it contained a
private video of him with his wife, recorded from a hidden camera installed in the ceiling of
his house. A copy of the video was ultimately published when the lawyer refused to accede
to the blackmail.
A 2013 report by Bahrain Watch documented how the Ministry of Interior’s Cyber Crime Unit
was deanonymizing pseudonymous Twitter activists by sending them IP logger links, and
then requesting subscriber data from local ISPs for the IP address that clicked on the link.
25/28

Activists who clicked were arrested or fired from their jobs. For example, a high school
student allegedly clicked on the IP logger link in the Facebook chat message in Figure
23 that was sent from the account of an arrested activist. The student was sentenced by a
Bahraini court to one year in prison because the account to which the IP logger link was sent
had earlier published tweets deemed offensive to Bahrain’s king.

Figure 23: IP Logger links included in messages like this one offering translation services
were used to identify those who clicked.
Leaked documents and investigations have revealed a number of additional surveillance
contracts between Bahrain’s government and foreign companies. In 2013, Bahrain’s Ministry
of Interior acquired Hacking Team’s spyware in 2013, though no Bahraini targets of Hacking
Team’s spyware were ever publicly identified. A 2016 investigation by Bahrain Watch and
The Intercept that reviewed Bahraini court documents showed that the Bahraini government
was using phone forensics technology sold by Cellebrite to extract private data from arrested
activists’ phones. Finally, a 2018 investigation by Haaretz revealed that Verint Systems Inc.
provided Bahrain with technology for social media monitoring.

5. Conclusion
Despite a half-decade of being implicated in human rights abuses, NSO Group regularly
claims that they are, in fact, committed to protecting human rights. The company has even
published a “Human Rights Policy,” a “Transparency and Responsibility Report,” and claimed
to subscribe to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
However, this purported concern is contradicted by a growing mountain of evidence that its
spyware is used by authoritarian regimes against human rights activists, journalists, and
other members of civil society.
Most recently, the Pegasus Project, a collaboration between Amnesty International and the
Forbidden Stories collective, has revealed that a wide range of countries have leveraged
Pegasus spyware to target and infect members of civil society, and their friends and family
members, around the globe. In the context of this report, we shared a list of the targeted
phone numbers we identified with Forbidden Stories. They confirmed that numbers
associated with five of the hacked devices were contained on the Pegasus Project’s list of
potential targets of NSO Group’s customers, data that Forbidden Stories and Amnesty
International describe as dating from 2016 up to several years ago.

Bahraini Misuse of NSO Spyware was Tragically Predictable
While NSO Group regularly attempts to discredit reports of abuse, their customer list
includes many notorious misusers of surveillance technology. The sale of Pegasus to
Bahrain is particularly egregious, considering that there is significant, longstanding, and
documented evidence of Bahrain’s serial misuse of surveillance products including Trovicor,
FinFisher, Cellebrite, and, now, NSO Group.
As highlighted in this report, Bahrain’s human rights track record is equally notorious:
According to Freedom House, Bahrain “has become one of the Middle East’s most
repressive states,” and has “systematically eliminated a broad range of political rights
and civil liberties, dismantled the political opposition, and cracked down harshly on
persistent dissent in the Shiite population.”
In 2019, Human Rights Watch said that Bahrain’s authorities had engaged in “unabated
repression,” and were “virtually eliminating all opposition.”
In 2017, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein,
remarked that “the government of Bahrain has imposed severe restrictions on civil
society and political activism through arrests, intimidation, travel bans and closure
orders, with increasing reports of torture by the security authorities,” adding that “the
democratic space in the country has essentially been shut down.”
Bahraini human rights advocates are imprisoned, monitored, and intimidated at home,
and those in exile are also subjected to digital and traditional means of repression.
These human rights abuses and prior sales of surveillance technologies are all a matter of
public record. These documented abuses should have been obvious “red flags” if NSO
Group was genuinely concerned about undertaking proper due diligence of its clients. The
fact that Bahrain used NSO Group’s spyware to target political opposition and activists, given
the country’s track record, was predictable. For NSO Group to sell Pegasus to Bahrain in
light of this evidence is gross negligence in the name of profit.

Protecting against Zero-Click Attacks involves Tradeoffs
We believe that the specific attacks we mention in this report could have been prevented by
disabling iMessage and FaceTime. However, NSO Group has successfully exploited other
messaging apps in the past to deliver malware, such as WhatsApp. Thus, disabling
iMessage and FaceTime would not offer complete protection from zero-click attacks or
spyware. Additionally, disabling iMessage means that messages exchanged via Apple’s builtin Messages app would be sent unencrypted (i.e., “green messages” instead of “blue
messages”), making them trivial for an attacker to intercept.
