Iranian Advanced Persistent Threat Actors Threaten
Election-Related Systems
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-296b

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are warning that Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) actors are likely
intent on influencing and interfering with the U.S. elections to sow discord among voters and
undermine public confidence in the U.S. electoral process.
The APT actors are creating fictitious media sites and spoofing legitimate media sites to
spread obtained U.S. voter-registration data, anti-American propaganda, and misinformation
about voter suppression, voter fraud, and ballot fraud.
The APT actors have historically exploited critical vulnerabilities to conduct distributed denialof-service (DDoS) attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections attacks, spearphishing campaigns, website defacements, and disinformation campaigns.

Technical Details
These actors have conducted a significant number of intrusions against U.S.-based networks
since August 2019. The actors leveraged several Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVEs)—notably CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2017-9248—pertaining to virtual private
networks (VPNs) and content management systems (CMSs).
CVE-2020-5902 affects F5 VPNs. Remote attackers could exploit this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code. [1].
CVE-2017-9248 affects Telerik UI. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability in web
applications using Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks.[2]
Historically, these actors have conducted DDoS attacks, SQL injections attacks, spearphishing campaigns, website defacements, and disinformation campaigns. These activities
could render these systems temporarily inaccessible to the public or election officials, which
could slow, but would not prevent, voting or the reporting of results.

1/6

A DDoS attack could slow or render election-related public-facing websites
inaccessible by flooding the internet-accessible server with requests; this would
prevent users from accessing online resources, such as voting information or nonofficial voting results. In the past, cyber actors have falsely claimed DDoS attacks have
compromised the integrity of voting systems in an effort to mislead the public that their
attack would prevent a voter from casting a ballot or change votes already cast.
A SQL injection involves a threat actor inserting malicious code into the entry field of
an application, causing that code to execute if entries have not been sanitized. SQL
injections are among the most dangerous and common exploits affecting websites. A
SQL injection into a media company’s CMS could enable a cyber actor access to
network systems to manipulate content or falsify news reports prior to publication.
Spear-phishing messages may not be easily detectible. These emails often ask
victims to fill out forms or verify information through links embedded in the email. APT
actors use spear phishing to gain access to information—often credentials, such as
passwords—and to identify follow-on victims. A malicious cyber actor could use
compromised email access to spread disinformation to the victims’ contacts or collect
information sent to or from the compromised account.
Public-facing website defacements typically involve a cyber threat actor
compromising the website or its associated CMS, allowing the actor to upload images
to the site’s landing page. In situations where such public-facing websites relate to
elections (e.g., the website of a county board of elections), defacements could cast
doubt on the security and legitimacy of the websites’ information. If cyber actors were
able to successfully change an election-related website, the underlying data and
internal systems would remain uncompromised..
Disinformation campaigns involve malign actions taken by foreign governments or
actors designed to sow discord, manipulate public discourse, or discredit the electoral
system. Malicious actors often use social media as well as fictitious and spoofed media
sites for these campaigns. Based on their corporate policies, social media companies
have worked to counter these actors’ use of their platforms to promote fictitious news
stories by removing the news stories, and in many instances, closing the accounts
related to the malicious activity. However, these adversaries will continue their attempts
to create fictitious accounts that promote divisive storylines to sow discord, even after
the election.

Mitigations
The following recommended mitigations list includes self-protection strategies against the
cyber techniques used by the APT actors:

2/6

Validate input—input validation is a method of sanitizing untrusted input provided by
web application users. Implementing input validation can protect against security flaws
of web applications by significantly reducing the probability of successful exploitation.
Types of attacks possibly prevented include SQL injection, XSS, and command
injection.
Audit your network for systems using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other
internet-facing services. Disable the service if unneeded or install available patches.
Users may need to work with their technology vendors to confirm that patches will not
affect system processes.
Verify all cloud-based virtual machine instances with a public IP; do not have open
RDP ports, unless there is a valid business reason to do so. Place any system with an
open RDP port behind a firewall, and require users to use a VPN to access it through
the firewall.
Enable strong password requirements and account lockout policies to defend against
brute-force attacks.
Apply multi-factor authentication, when possible.
Apply system and software updates regularly, particularly if you are deploying products
affected by CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2017-9248.
For patch information on CVE-2020-5902, refer to F5 Security Advisory
K52145254.
For patch information on CVE-2017-9248, refer to Progress Telerik details for
CVE-2017-9248.
Maintain a good information back-up strategy that involves routinely backing up all
critical data and system configuration information on a separate device. Store the
backups offline; verify their integrity and restoration process.
Enable logging and ensure logging mechanisms capture RDP logins. Keep logs for a
minimum of 90 days, and review them regularly to detect intrusion attempts.
When creating cloud-based virtual machines, adhere to the cloud provider's best
practices for remote access.
Ensure third parties that require RDP access are required to follow internal policies on
remote access.
Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Where possible, critical
devices should not have RDP enabled.
Regulate and limit external to internal RDP connections. When external access to
internal resources is required, use secure methods, such as VPNs, recognizing VPNs
are only as secure as the connected devices.
Be aware of unsolicited contact on social media from any individual you do not know.
Be aware of attempts to pass links or files via social media from anyone you do not
know.
Be aware of unsolicited requests to share a file via online services.

3/6

Be aware of email messages conveying suspicious alerts or other online accounts,
including login notifications from foreign countries or other alerts indicating attempted
unauthorized access to your accounts.
Be suspicious of emails purporting to be from legitimate online services (e.g., the
images in the email appear to be slightly pixelated and/or grainy, language in the email
seems off, the email originates from an IP address not attributable to the
provider/company).
Be suspicious of unsolicited email messages that contain shortened links (e.g., via
tinyurl , bit.ly ).
Use security features provided by social media platforms, use strong passwords,
change passwords frequently, and use a different password for each social media
account.
See CISA’s Tip on Best Practices for Securing Election Systems for more information.
General Mitigations
Keep applications and systems updated and patched

Apply all available software updates and patches; automate this process to the greatest
extent possible (e.g., by using an update service provided directly from the vendor).
Automating updates and patches is critical because of the speed at which threat actors
create exploits after a patch is released. These “N-day” exploits can be as damaging as a
zero-day exploits. Vendor updates must also be authentic; updates are typically signed and
delivered over protected links to ensure the integrity of the content. Without rapid and
thorough patch application, threat actors can operate inside a defender’s patch cycle.[3] In
addition to updating the application, use tools (e.g., the OWASP Dependency-Check Project
tool[4]) to identify publicly known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that the application
depends on.
Scan web applications for SQL injection and other common web vulnerabilities

Implement a plan to scan public-facing web servers for common web vulnerabilities (SQL
injection, cross-site scripting, etc.); use a commercial web application vulnerability scanner in
combination with a source code scanner.[5] As vulnerabilities are found, they should be fixed
or patched. This is especially crucial for networks that host older web applications; as sites
get older, more vulnerabilities are discovered and exposed.
Deploy a web application firewall

Deploy a web application firewall (WAF) to help prevent invalid input attacks and other
attacks destined for the web application. WAFs are intrusion/detection/prevention devices
that inspect each web request made to and from the web application to determine if the
request is malicious. Some WAFs install on the host system and others are dedicated
devices that sit in front of the web application. WAFs also weaken the effectiveness of
automated web vulnerability scanning tools.
Deploy techniques to protect against web shells
4/6

Patch web application vulnerabilities or fix configuration weaknesses that allow web shell
attacks, and follow guidance on detecting and preventing web shell malware.[6] Malicious
cyber actors often deploy web shells—software that can enable remote administration—on a
victim’s web server. Malicious cyber actors can use web shells to execute arbitrary system
commands, which are commonly sent over HTTP or HTTPS. Attackers often create web
shells by adding or modifying a file in an existing web application. Web shells provide
attackers with persistent access to a compromised network using communications channels
disguised to blend in with legitimate traffic. Web shell malware is a long-standing, pervasive
threat that continues to evade many security tools.
Use multi-factor authentication for administrator accounts

Prioritize protection for accounts with elevated privileges, with remote access, and/or used
on high value assets.[7] Use physical token-based authentication systems to supplement
knowledge-based factors such as passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs).[8]
Organizations should migrate away from single-factor authentication, such as passwordbased systems, which are subject to poor user choices and more susceptible to credential
theft, forgery, and password reuse across multiple systems.
Remediate critical web application security risks

First, identify and remedite critical web application security risks first; then, move on to other
less critical vulnerabilities. Follow available guidance on securing web applications.[9],[10],
[11]

Implement your security incident response and business continuity plan

It may take time for your organization’s IT professionals to isolate and remove threats to your
systems and restore normal operations. In the meantime, take steps to maintain your
organization’s essential functions according to your business continuity plan. Organizations
should maintain and regularly test backup plans, disaster recovery plans, and business
continuity procedures.
